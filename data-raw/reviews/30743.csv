<p>Model</p>

<p>This cute little piece of castle is the first in many years set that fits the medieval-themed series. And though it is really small, I think it is worth attention.</p>

<p>Castle contains two parts. First&nbsp;is that somewhat rounded tower, with window and some roof on which you can put a minifig. On the roof there is also small flag pole, and big blue shield, that should represent a coat-of-arms I believe. It looks great, those bits of blue break the gray scheme of the model. Also, on the top there are some cheese slopes that represents battlements.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the castle is a bit too short to properly fit a knight inside. But that&#39;s not a big problem. As a final detail there is an olive green leaf on the side. It looks fine and add some reality to the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some flaws on this part of course. For example, dark 1x3 on the bottom of the wall looks weird, is ugly unfitting. It also breaks the balance of the model, makes its oddly unsymmetrical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second part of the castle is very short (both in terms of height and length) wall. But it looks good. Add some depth to the castle. It is attached by old type of hinge, which allows to put it on a nice angle. Battlements look&nbsp;great, and dark tan slopes add some colors to the whole model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a final touch we get tiny catapult. It has an imitation of wheels, which looks cute. It works prety fine. As an ammo, we get 2 (3 if you count spare parts) of each type: black stud (rock), tr. orange stud with a hole (fire?) and new poo part (that one is obvious). It both looks and works great.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>They&#39;re quite useful. We get five 2x2 quarter round bricks, a ton of cheese slopes, old type of castle window , and blue nexo-knight shield. Rest of the bricks is more generic, but still useful.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>It is a very solid set. For me, great fan of castle series, this was clearly a must-have. It it was worth its price (in Poland it&#39;s ~$3.5)</p>

<p>Hope it&#39;s helpful.</p>
