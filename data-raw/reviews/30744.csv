Very simple with cool color combinations and a neat retro inspired minifig. Very swooshable! I&#39;m looking forward to picking up a couple more to change it up to classic space color themes. The minifigure body is the same as the Creator 31107 https://brickset.com/sets/31107-1/Space-Rover-Explorer</p>

<p>As a gift or for yourself...do it!</p>

"Decimus","2021-01-18T16:16:17.56Z","Awesome Build at a Good Price","<p>I just recently got this set as my first ever 3-in-1 on a whim, and have never been so pleasantly surprised. This set is just the right size, and delivers great style and playability at super low cost.</p>

<p>The packaging: 5/5 - Nothing out of the ordinary, although it does use those annoying thumb-tab boxes which always seem to break. The box also has some cool printing in the background.</p>

<p>The Instructions: 3/5 - Correct, but I did notice a bit of double printing, with some weird out-of-focus color mixing. I&#39;ve never seen this on a lego instruction manual before, so it was a bit annoying.</p>

<p>Parts: 5/5 - Some really fun parts here. Sand blue bricks are always a welcome addition. The set includes a few parts that aren&#39;t overly common, not necessarily rare, but not common either. Generally, the set has a fun assortment of components to build your own designs or to just add to your collection.</p>

<p>Building Experience: 4/5 - Each build is very fun and also has some simple little quirks that were fun to see. Quite easy, but I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s a bad thing, especially not at this price.</p>

<p>Completed Models: 5/5 - The main build looks awesome. It would fit right in with other more expensive lego space sets, and just has an awesome, polished sci-fi feel. Matches very nicely with Mars Mission or Galaxy Squad sets. The secondary builds are also quite nice looking, but I have to give the speeder the credit when it comes to looking polished. The speeder is slick and looks menacing with its x-shaped wings and front pincers. It is also fairly large, being somewhat chunkier than your standard starwars speeder. The walker, while my personal favourite of the two side builds, looks simpler. I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s a bad thing, as it reminds me of the mechs from the space themes in the 80s and 90s. It can also be easily modified with spare parts from the set to give it more detail.</p>

<p>Minifigures: 5/5 - Absolutely awesome minifigure. The torso and legs seem to be borrowed from the astronaut from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31107-1/Space-Rover-Explorer"">31107 Space Rover Explorer</a>. There is no printing on the legs, but the torso has some pretty decent prints with the lego space logo on the front along with a harness and belt on the front and back. But, the main reason this figure is so cool is the head. The light blue translucent head piece is just like the ones used on androids for the Exploriens and Spyrius lines form the 90s. It has both front and back printing, and a beautifully empty facial expression. This simple minifigure is absolutely awesome for any sci-fi space collection you may have going on.</p>

<p>Playability: 5/5 - Seriously, this set is awesome in terms of playability. The main build is very swooshable, and also quite solid. The other two builds are also surprisingly swooshable and original. They are quite solid (except for the engine cones). I dropped the mech walker off my desk onto tile, and only lost pieces from the right arm, so I am very pleased with that. The walker also has a rudimentary walking motion. While this is very simple and old-fashioned, it gives the mech a fun little waddle. Overall, this is a great set for younger lego fans, as it gives a nice variety of things to build while also leaving room for creativity.</p>

<p>Value for Money: 5/5 - Awesome Value. Three sweet builds and a cool minifigure for $10.00 USD is pretty darn good.</p>

<p>Overall: 37/40 - Very good set. I can&#39;t honestly find a fault with it, especially not at this price. Great minifigure, good and original builds that look good and hold together well. Awesome play value and good parts selection. It&#39;s a definite must-have.</p>

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-02-24T13:51:53.73Z","Solid, swooshable model good for target audience","<p>In summary: solid little model, very swooshable, nice minifig, highly suited for target audience. Reasonable set of parts, and nice colours.</p>

<p>I&#39;m generally a fan of Creator 3-in-1, but this set I primarily bought for the minifig, which I think is pretty cool all by itself. However, my 6yo daughter decided she wanted to build a spaceship, and I happened to have this one ready to go.</p>

<p>The building experience is good, if a little advanced for the 6+ rating, in my opinion. That is mainly due to a number of Technic connections that are quite difficult for little fingers. However, this is also a great model for building techniques for younger builders - at least 3 distinct sideways (SNOT) building methods used in quite a small model.</p>

<p>As an adult build, it&#39;s quite simple, and I tend to look to these sets as either a basis for something else, or as parts packs. Haven&#39;t tried the alternate models, but the mech looks decent. Overall, there&#39;s a nice selection of parts, especially the sand blue, but nothing too exotic. In&nbsp; fact, apart from the canopy, I could happily recreate this model with parts from my collection.</p>

<p>Play value for the target audience is where this really seems to shine. It&#39;s a very solid build, nothing loose ort prone to falling off (if it&#39;s intact after a day in the hands of my little one, then it&#39;s a winner). Much more solid than most City sets in that regard. Cockpit is quite easy-access, so not too fiddly to get the minifig in and out. Plus it&#39;s a nice little spacecraft and very swooshable.</p>

<p>Pretty good value, although quite a few small parts, so full price isn&#39;t ideal - I used it as a basket filler for a GWP promotion.</p>

"Triptychon","2021-01-29T09:54:24.537Z","Fun, perfect for playing and sturdy design","<p>I am writing as a parent / AFOL but maybe I was&nbsp;a little influenced from my AFOL side while writing the review ;-).&nbsp;</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>@George <em>thank you for this awesome build.</em></p>

<p><em>---</em></p>

<p><em>A parents review and why we love this set</em></p>

<p>I must admit I bought this more for myself because I haven&#39;t bought a small 3+1 creator set like this for a long, long time. But when I came home with the box, my 16-month-old son instantly recognised the &quot;drone&quot; as an airplane and he told me so with his sound for airplane.<br />
So we started to build the first steps together. After three to five bricks we stopped following the instructions and just placed the pieces like the little one wanted - which is compiled fine considering his age.<br />
Anyway, I finished building the drone and when I was finished he really wanted to play with it. Usually he is playing with Duplo, but as he was so enthusiastic about it I gave it a try (with supervision of course).<br />
Since then, we are playing daily with the drone, and we both love that you have so many moving parts with this design. As I already mentioned in the title, the design is so sturdy that when he is playing that the drone is flying, or he opens and closes the cockpit everything holds firm.<br />
We haven&#39;t tried the other two variants yet, because he just loves the drone too much at the moment. From my side and comparing it to other sets I know, this one really has great playability especially because of the moving parts of the design.</p>

<p><br />
---</p>

<p><br />
TLDR: Great design which doesn&#39;t fall apart easily when you play with it and if it does can be put together without much thought. High playability due to the moving parts. AFOL me is thinking: I need a whole fleet of those super drones ;-).<br />
Only *** for the parts &ndash; even though everything is great about the drone I would have loved some other parts for it to polish it up just a little more &ndash; but again that is the AFOL speaking, not the parent and I understand that it is a 3+1 set and not a stand-alone set ... but nevertheless this is something which could improved upon in my opinion.</p>

"SleeplesSSP","2021-08-08T04:55:10.41Z","Amazing Set You Almost Slept On","<p>You probably didn&#39;t even see this set in the aisle, it&#39;s very unassuming and Creator sets arent&#39; generalyl lookers. I implore you to stop and take a close look.</p>

<p>This set isn&#39;t like typical Creator sets. Instead of being designed around one central &quot;theme,&quot; they&#39;ve sort of given it a little story. You get one minifigure, a cyber drone, and the set is named after him. The three builds are said drone&#39;s three vehicles: a spaceship with rockets, a second airborne vehicle, and a mech suit.</p>

<p>The minifigure included in this set, a unique cyber drone, is rather unique. The use of the Classic Space logo implies this character takes place in some far-off distant future of LEGO City, where the machines have risen up and gone to war with the humans or something. The detailing on his face rivals that of Star Wars, and the print on the back inadvertently doubles as a HAL 9000-style face print, really playing into this dystopian theme and giving children an opportunity to create multiple &quot;soldiers&quot; out of this figure. The use of a translucent blue head and a metallic silver body and legs gives this figure charm that I can only describe as &quot;unexplainably magical.&quot; This is a high quality minifigure for the price point of the set, he practically sells it. Do not pick up this set without the figure on eBay, you&#39;re missing half the fun.</p>

<p>That all being said, don&#39;t let this perfect figure distract from the quality of the builds themselves. If you&#39;re a longtime fan of LEGO&#39;s many sci-fi themes, a lover of those classic 2001-style Creator robots, or just a fan of vibrantly-colored spacecraft, this set does a lot. The missile launchers use very similar designs to some early 2000&#39;s Star Wars models, the little angled wings on the tail give it that quirky vibe only LEGO can pull off, and the small size makes it a great hand-friendly toy and cheap alternative to a licensed star cruiser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a kid who loves playing with LEGO, not just building it, check this set out. With a $10 price point, three builds, cool minifigure, tons of roleplay potential, and the fact that, as others have said, this set is &quot;swooshable,&quot; it&#39;s a guaranteed great toy for any kid who just likes his spaceships.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is the quality craftsmanship I want more of from LEGO. Not $300 mega ships that gather dust, but toys like this which appeal to all ages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Side note: Yes, I&#39;ve been playing around with this minifig while sitting at my desk for a day or two now. So cool!</p>
