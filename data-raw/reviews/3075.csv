"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T13:05:00Z","As good as any other 90's set! ","I acquired this set from an ebay lot.  It's rather mediocre, but to be honest this is probably one of the most ingenious sets produced after 1995! At any rate, I can't see the appeal of this set.  

The minifig is sub-standard (no pun intended), and the parts in the set lack versatility to make alternate models.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-31T23:30:02Z","super set!","Although it is small, I really like this set and its design.
 The Aquashark fin has a cool patern on it and makes it look kind of like a real shark.  The wind screne can be used to build more things than just subs or sharks.  This set has a nice color scheme and I realy like the color of the propellors.  

The fig is also realy cool. His trans green hook makes him look like an under water pirate.  Also His diving suit is quite cool because it can store a couple harpoons or knives.
If you are looking for a sleek, small spy ship for your collection, it suits the purpose perfectly.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T12:13:48Z","Best Set","This is my all-time favorite set. I know it sounds silly, but I thought it was so cool, I took it everywhere with me, even restaraunts. I always admired the silver pylons on the side and the pontoons on the bottom. This is a wonderful set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T18:56:35Z","Perfect starter set for Aquazone","Ah, yes I remember this set, just rebuilt it yesterday and had a war with my other aqua- ships. Some good MOC pieces are included such as the black pontoons ( the thingeabobs under the hull ) Also has a very balanced design and color scheme, well fiting for the undersea.
One con is included, the lack of a crystal or crystal compartment in the set, would make playing more exciting. Overall, 10/10. A great way to get the leader of Aquasharks and good play value for a cheap price! (even today, 10 years later ;))

"Blade","2007-10-22T05:37:10.56Z","Underwater Spy","If I remember correctly this was about my third Aquazone set and I feel it is still champion. The name is very true as well, an excellent sub for spying.

The model itself has great shape and really adds something to the series. The color scheme is just right consisting of black, blue and fluro orange. The detail on the hatch and fin are painted on not stickered so another plus from me. With duel propellers, underwater lights an spears on the side you can see the detail that has gone into this mid sized model. This model is controlled by a control panel.

The mini-fig is standard Aquashark dressed in all black with black suit, red visor and a fluorescent yellow hook hand. Also this model come with a green bushel of underwater plant life. The only real thing missing from this model was a crystal but really there is no where to put it. A creature could have worked as well. 

Overall it is a great model that added something in size and value to the series. I am still a big Aquazone fan but am trying to be as unbiased as possible. I feel this model is about a 7/10 and only being about ten dollars back in the day I can't find a reason to complain. If you like underwater sets get this one. Also if you are looking or something cool and different Aquazone is the series for you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-28T10:51:21.143Z","Good, not great","The Aquasharks were great. Their sleek ships were arguably the coolest of the Aquazone. This set however pales in comparison to the two larger Aquashark sets. Also, my set came with a grey hook instead of a transparent green one, not that big of a deal, but a bit disappointing.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-26T16:27:24.343Z","Shark Attack","This is one of the 2 Aquashark sets that was released in 1996 as the second wave.  It uses the standard Aquashark colours of black and blue with transparent orange highlights.  As the colour scheme works, there was no need to fix it.  The set design seems to be a scaled down version of 6155 and that is one point against this set.  Otherwise, the little vehicle is nicely done - solid and a good build.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-06-28T08:45:01.39Z","Decent","I think the biggest plus about this set is the minifig. Who doesn't love a minifig buffed up with a heavy duty swimming suit? Haha, but anyway, the minifig is cool, because this is one of the few sets that comes with the special Aquashark diver who has a beard and a neon-green transparent hook-hand. 

My one qualm with this is the vehicle's shape. It's a cool looking thing, but when you look at the bottom of it, wouldn't you think it is more of a boat than a sub? Eh, thats my opinion. I had been collecting all of the Aquashark sets, and as much as I didn't like this set, it had to be added into the group. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"dsg13x","2010-01-22T16:16:26.67Z","Great special pieces!","I like this set very much!  Cool transparent hook and awesome shark design window piece.  It reminds me of WWII fighter plane design.  My girlfriend wants another one now for our beta fish tank!  The set is small compact and very sturdy compared to small space sets ect..    I build my lego dets as a time rift/alt reality set up and use various time period sets within my building.  Mostly I use castle or space but this is great.  

The orange pieces are great for any ship or space building project!  Enjoy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T13:48:20.113Z","Aquasharks' Leader in a Small Set","<p>Set #6135 Spy Shark: The Aquasharks are led by a mean looking fellow with a hook, or at least I think they were. Since this was the set I had that included this Mini-Figure, or rather one of them because I seem to recall owning two of him from two different sets, then this is who I felt was leader of the Aquasharks. (It just fit, considering he had a hook and the Aquasharks were like modern pirates of the deep and Captain Redbeard had a hook.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spy Shark submarine is sort of the junior version of the Deep Sea Predator. It is designed for a single pilot, includes the transparent orange cockpit piece with shark printing and the fin piece. This submarine didn't include any manipulator arms, but it didn't suffer from that lack of pieces. It was a simple and fun build with a menacing look to it, put it next to the Deep Sea Predator and you had a pair of terrifying submarines scouring the depths for the coveted energy crystals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Aquashark Mini-Figure included with this set, as I mentioned before, has the transparent green hook hand. His torso printing was suitable for deep divers and his head featured a menacing looking print, if memory serves. (It's been a while since I've seen one in person.) As always you gotta love the unique accessories these divers used, the chromed silver daggers were a great pair of pieces and the torpedoes (though an odd choice for hand-to-hand combat.) were numerous and plentiful. Since I rarely followed the backstories of LEGO Themes back then I thought the crystals they were hunting for were used in the construction of their weapons. (Why else would both the weapons and the crystals be chromed?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fully recommend the Aquazone Theme to anyone who enjoys underwater adventures. I also think they'd make a fine addition to your LEGO Atlantis Collection for the more modern LEGO collectors (and Younger fans of Atlantis.). The new Shark Warrior Mini-Figures could join forces with the old Aquashark Divers easily enough, perhaps as new mutant warriors genetically bred to hunt down and capture the elusive energy crystals for the Aquasharks' use. Possibilities are endless when you combine LEGO, fertile imagination and play.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-03T22:01:49.29Z","The spy who didn't really like me. ","To say that Aquashark engineers are slightly lacking in creativity would be quite the understatement. Of the four underwater vehicles that the Aquasharks had during their short-lived existence, three of them feature the bizarre trans-orange shark face piece as their central focus, while the fourth, the Shark Scout (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6115-1"">6115</a>), is simply too small to use it! I guess if you're going to make a gimmick piece, you may as well go all the way with it.<div><br></div><div>The obvious problem is that there are so many variations on a theme that one can make when one ties one's hands down with a highly specialised piece, and points have to be given to the Spy Shark, which, ironically enough, eschews the typical shark shape in favour of a more compact design. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that Spy Shark has Aquanaut look to it, employing liberal use of those octagonal prism pieces (there is surely a better way to describe them) as torpedo-like propellers for the bottom of the vessel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As a whole, the trans-orange/blue/black colour scheme seems to work surprisingly well, though it always brings to mind thoughts of a kind of evil <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Ice%20Planet%202002"">Ice Planet</a>. What you see is what you get: it's a compact, single-person vehicle, and there aren't any particularly nuanced details that need writing home about. The interior has a suitably airtight feel, as one might expect from an underwater vessel, and there's more than enough room to snugly fit the lone Aquashark Minifig that comes with this set. And what a Minifig he is! Not only is he sporting that cool Aquashark gear that was awesome at the time (and still is now), but he's also got a weird trans-green hook for a hand! As mentioned by at least one previous reviewer, it's hard not to consider this very special Aquashark as the leader of the underwater miscreants, and the coolness factor is enough that the choice of trans-green for the hand can be safely overlooked.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Aquazone was a brave foray into a vastly different world from LEGO's point of view, but I have to say that the good guys seemed to fare far better with this first wave than the bad guys. There's not a whole lot that's very special about this set, and I feel like I struggled a bit to even come up with this much to say. If you're looking to start a collection of underwater LEGO, I think you're better off checking out the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Aquazone&amp;subtheme=Stingrays"">Stingrays</a>, which seem like a much more refined subtheme, though I unfortunately never owned any of them. As for the Aquasharks, if you have one set, you have them all, and I would have to say that Deep Sea Predator (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6155-1"">6155</a>) is probably the only representative you need from this now-classic line. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,3
