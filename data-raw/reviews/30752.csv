<p>This $10 set gives you a Han Solo minifigure that has only been included in three other sets but they all range in price from $40 to $500 so that might be a reason why you need this figure like I did until now.&nbsp; This was worth it to me for that reason alone.</p>

<p>The micro Millennium Falcon looks nearly the same as the version from 2018 with Chewbacca, set #<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75193-1/Millennium-Falcon-Microfighter"">75193</a>, that was based on the Solo film.&nbsp; The radar dish is obviously different due to the changes in the movies.&nbsp; The engine design is different in this new version to make it look much more like the ship in the movies by using 1x2 transparent plates.&nbsp; This is big improvement in my opinion.&nbsp; Because this set is marketed towards kids it has stud shooters on the top for the ship laser cannons.&nbsp; That&#39;s the only detracting feature to me but I&#39;ll take those off and put something better there.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend this set to anyone who is a Star Wars fan.&nbsp; A palm sized ship that swooshes around your house with a scoundrel pilot on board always makes you day better.</p>
