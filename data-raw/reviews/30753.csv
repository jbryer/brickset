"Struhadlo","2021-01-18T16:22:13.673Z","Finally Beskar Mando","<p><strong>Following review is spoiler free! (Except for a very minor spoiler by the end of the review which shall be advertised in time)</strong></p>

<p>Not giving us a full beskar armour Mando in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75292-1/The-Razor-Crest"" target=""_blank"">75292</a>&nbsp;was a grave mistake indeed which many overlooked but still left a bitter taste in my mouth and is one of the reasons I never got that set as of now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for Baby Yoda, the cheapest set to contain this very desirable minifig at the end of 2020 is in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75318-1/The-Child"" target=""_blank"">75318</a>. And thusly, a $30 set boasting with both of these was a sure way to make many Lego Star Wars fans very happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>As far as the price goes I have not noticed any backlash from the community with regard to the price and I do agree that the set is priced fairly but it could do with one more minifig probably another Tusken Raider. Usually I am against crowding the set with useless additional minifigs but in this case, it feels awkward to have a tent and a ballista both operated and inhabited by a lonely Tusken Raider. It is not that much about the price as it is about the overall appearance of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>Again, I think the set would be better off with one more Tusken Raider.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tusken Raider. A classic and absolutely stellar Tusken Raider. The head mold is out of this&nbsp;world. Both printing and detailing are more than sufficient. I think these &quot;new&quot; Tusken Raiders are here to stay and serve very well for years to come. The only possible upgrade I can imagine is an arm printing which I&nbsp;do not find necessary at this point. This is the single belt over the chest variant and comes with a light grey bottom end of the Gaderffii.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mando. Finally, a full beskar armour Mando! Our beloved bounty hunter comes in a brand-new printing style which covers his whole body except for toes and even arms! And it looks impeccable.&nbsp;The arm printing here is second to none and shows the detailed armour pretty well and even contains the whistling birds. The helmet might be wee too shiny and bright. Otherwise, the helmet is the same old mold we are used to for many years now. As for the torso and the back print, we see many details on this new minifig such as small pockets, wrinkles on the cloth and belts with ammunition. The cape is the rough paper-ish material and is in a corresponding colour to the rest of the body. It is also the smaller cape. Mando is armed with a pistol in a shape of a nozzle with shaft and a blaster rifle made out of three separate parts. The rifle really needs a stock as it looks super awkward this way.</li>
	<li>Baby Yoda. I was very surprised by how small this minifig truly is. I have never held a babyfig and this is my first. It is one stud wide basically and a regular minifig can hold it in its hand. The head is made out of rubber and is a separate piece which is enormously cute. The printing job on the head is fine but the body really needs to get a better printing. The current one is probably sufficient but looks little cheap.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The set comes with a bag to carry Baby Yoda around and you can put it around Mando&#39;s legs or neck and it again looks very cute. One bigger drawback I see is the apparent lack of jetpack.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>Or better yet, builds. These builds overall set the scene pretty well. And do not worry, the set is pretty random and does not spoil too much from the show.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speeder. The speeder is wee oversized but not to the point of looking ridiculous. It can seat Mando comfortably and has a bag to carry Baby Yoda in. There is also a regular bag which could have been the jetpack! The build is fairly detailed and consists of pretty regular parts. The front part can be bended upwards a wee bit. There are also two handles for the weaponry right next to the seating area. Overall I would say that this is a pretty sweet little vehicle with a lot of details and nice colour palette. Furthermore, there are no stud shooters nor any other play features.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Tent. This tent is pretty hallow on the paper but when held in hands and played with it feels pretty well-built and detailed enough. You can unfold the circular walling around the middle pillar. In case you get two of these sets you can probably with some mild modding close up the whole area. There are two seats inside and a bucket with a bone. You get another bone a spare part. The gaps between each panel are noticeable but I do not think it completely breaks the immersion or ruins the play potential of the set.</li>
	<li>Ballista. Lego did a pretty awesome job designing this thing and making it look as authentic as possible regarding the limited piece count they had to work with here. This bolt shooter has three legs and a transparent two by two brick at the bottom for a secure stability. The simulated winch reel at the front can be positioned up and down. There are four limbs and each can be positioned to a certain degree. The upper ones have a larger range of motion while those at the bottom are limited by their connection to the end of the ballista. Instead of a barrel this model comes with a spring-loaded shooter with silver bolts. The set comes with&nbsp;two bolts. There are two additional limbs pointing to the middle of the simulated strings which in a real case of a ballista would do absolutely nothing but so would four limbs at the front. Historical nitpicks aside this build looks pretty accurate to the show counterpart and gives the set what feels almost like a Lego requirement an action feature.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>As for the playability this set does deliver and makes for a perfect birthday gift for example. Since it comes with two possibly fighting minifigs and a bunch of builds to position and destroy, any kid will probably be glad to play with this one. The builds can be easily rebuilt after some fighting is done. Speaking of building, the building process feels like fun and there is almost no redundancies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>AN ALTERNATIVE</strong></p>

<p><strong>MILD SPOILER AHEAD!</strong></p>

<p>My idea for a perfect version of this set would be the following and keep in mind, this does&nbsp;not affect the final score. I would add another Tusken raider, Cob Vanth&nbsp;and his&nbsp;speeder. This version of the set would set you back $40.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I think this is a sweet little set which is absolutely perfect for the January time wave of sets. It is nice to see some more love from Lego for this show and finally a beskar Mando. I would recommend this set mostly to kids but it can be a cool display scene from the show if you are into that. For the price the amount of stuff feels appropriate and I would love to see Lego do more of these non-vehicle $30 sets from the Star Wars universe in the future.</p>

<p>Trouble on Tatooine is the long awaited set to include Din Djarin in his Beskar armour first seen in season one chapter 3 , but whilst the inclusion of the figure is great , this set still leaves a fair bit to be desired .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>(SPOILERS for the Mandalorian season two)</p>

<p>The Minifigures are a decent selection with one that stands out , that figure being Din Djarin himself he finally has a silver helmet not the inaccurate gun metal grey used previously , his head is still an unprinted black head , his cape is still the thinner design in dark grey , his torso is fantastic showing his very shiny armour which continues onto the legs and the arms have printing to show more of his armour including the Mudhorn signet , the flame thrower and the Whistling birds , he wields his pulse rifle built out of a blaster pistol , dark brown lightsaber hilt and a black clip and a pump piece in black for his regular pistol , next we have Grogu , baby Yoda , the child whatever you call him I personally like Grogu , he has the same rubbery head mould and small baby body piece print and finally we have the Tusken Raider he has a fantastic dual moulded head with dark tan and dark grey and some nice robe printing that continues onto the legs , he wields the same weapon that Boba Fett used in chapter 14 a gaderffii stick and yes that is how it is spelled it uses a light grey ice cream cone , a 1&times;3 redish brown rod , a three stud redish brown lightsaber hilt and a 1&times;1 redish brown cone .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>The builds do vary in quality starting with the best , Dins swoop/speeder bike it is built on a 2&times;3 dark grey plate , with some dark grey underside slopes going towards the front , a snot plate at the back attaching a modified 1&times;2 dark grey plate with two 1&times;1 light grey curves to add more texture at the back , the sides are full of great greebleing detail including dark orange modified 1&times;1 plates , 1&times;4 light grey rods , light grey bar studs , more 1&times;1 light grey curves , a light grey lever and some modified snot plates . The seating area has some light tan clips on each side for the pulse rifle and blaster to be attached , a 1&times;2 light tan grille , further back there is a 1&times;2 redish brown grille and a redish brown backpack and the baby holder piece released with city in 2018 in dark tan which can hold Grogu very securely&nbsp; , the handle bars are attached to a technic plate assembly with a 2&times;2 light grey dish in the centre and some angled handle bars using light grey pump pieces , a pair of dark grey rods are used to get the slanted down front of the bike , where they attach to some clips with a hinge which straightened the nose out and the very front has some angled plates in dark grey attached to some snots with slopes angling to the front and two black stamp pieces as tiny blasters at the very end . The next best build is probably the ballista (Tusken giant bow and arrow) , it is built on a 2&times;2 trans clear brick with three legs around it built out of ratchet joints and plates , the back has a hinge connection with a dark tan slope attaching a snot plate , a 1&times;1 hollow black stud and a light grey pump piece , a technic bar goes through attaching a dark grey four pronged technic bushing on each side to represent a winch , the body&nbsp;has some light grey stamp pieces and tiles in front with a spring loaded shooter in the middle which fired silver bolts which are exclusive to this set and two are included , the front has a build attached with two dark grey battle droid arms with two redish brown 2&times;2 dishes around it as it represents the reel where the rope would come from , next to each spring load underneath a 2&times;2 redish brown dish there is a stack underneath each of redish brown bar clips , there is a build identical on each side using a dark tan plate and slope and a light tan 1&times;2 grille and this build is done four times except the ones underneath have a car wheel connecter , which attached to a clip , then a light grey flexi tube , another clip and then to a stamp to look like there is real friction with a dark tan tile joining the middle of each . And finally the Tusken Raider tent which do have some significance to Star Wars (cough cough Shmi Skywalker) , it is built on a 4&times;6 light tan plate with some dark grey hinge plates with 4&times;4 light tan angled plate and two 3&times;3 redish brown angled plates as they all angle in with the walls which are attached with snot plates and are built out of an alternating design of 2&times;4 dark tan plates and 2&times;4 dark tan tiles with a ratchet joint angling a pair of&nbsp; 2&times;3 dark tan wing plates to get the dome style roof , the centre has a modified 2&times;2 light grey brick with a technic beam going through and a rounded build ontop to complete the roof , there is also a black pot inside with a small bone in it and a light grey stamp with a 2&times;2 dish for another bowl in the back . There is also a camp fire which attaches it is&nbsp; built on two light tan rounded 4&times;8 plates , a 4&times;4 light grey round plate in the middle , with a jumper in the middle attaching a redish brown four pronged technic bushing pieces with a flame in trans orange in the middle and four 1&times;1 dark grey cheese slopes and a clip on a light grey ratchet connector so it can go with the tent .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this set includes some great builds , like the bike and ballista , but the other build being the tent isn&#39;t a bad build per say but is flawed with ridiculous amount of gaps at the back which are to obvious , and a character should have been included who was in the episode this set is based on , Cobb Vanth and remove the tent and include his speeder and an extra Tusken , or if Lego didn&#39;t have that material at hand when designing then perhaps include another Tusken and a Massif (Tusken dog ) as one Tusken is not enough but overall this set is worth it for the price and what&#39;s included especially the Mando figure so I recommend it .</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2021-01-31T06:05:00.183Z","You’ll buy it cause it’s Mando, but you probably shouldn’t ","<p>So the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75292-1/The-Razor-Crest""> Razor Crest</a> was perhaps the set that I was most looking forward to from the Mandalorian, but the biggest disappointment in that set was Mando&#39;s armor. Finally, a set has been released featuring his shiny beskar, and I was pretty excited to get it even though I was not too impressed with the pictures that were released of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>So finally Mando is wearing beskar! However, that isn&#39;t the only upgrade he received from Lego. His helmet is now a shiny silver instead of a dark gray. Plus his&nbsp;arms are printed and feature his signet of the mudhorn as well as his whistling birds. However, he still has a gray cape when it really should be black, he still doesn&#39;t have his jetpack, and his head is still a plain black one. Now I can almost forgive the cape and lack of jetpack, but no face? I realize he wasn&#39;t supposed to take off his helmet, but we did see his face at the end of season 1, so they easily could have given him a proper head. And now with season 2 behind us, it is even more infuriating since apparently he has no issues removing his helmet to don stormtrooper gear, rescue Baby Yoda, or even say goodbye to Baby Yoda. At this point in time, even Luke Skywalker has seen his face, and you know he&#39;s gonna tell Leia all about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Baby Yoda is the same as appeared in the Razor Crest and of course as cute as ever. Obviously for anyone who didn&#39;t want to spend the money on the Razor Crest this is a good enough reason to pick up this set, although you&#39;d be wise to dish out the big bucks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you get a sandperson, who looks great but isn&#39;t unique to the set. Of course it is always good to get these guys to build up your single file line of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly Cobb Vanth was not included in the set which is a real missed opportunity and probably means we won&#39;t ever see him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Aside from the minifigures, the parts are probably the most interesting thing about this set. A lot of stuff you don&#39;t typically see in Star Wars sets, as well as colors that you&#39;ll only find on Tatooine. Plus you get the pouch for Baby Yoda which Mando could even wear, although you need to turn his helmet slightly to the side.</p>

<p>The Models</p>

<p>So the set is divided into three bags, one for each model which are all similarly sized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First up is the speeder, which is arguably the best of the three. It&#39;s not that this speeder is revolutionary, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s very different from any other speeder bike we have seen. The details are excellent, and it has the ability not only to carry Baby Yoda accurately along with a diaper bag, but it can also carry both of Mando&#39;s weapons. This would be an excellent model for a battle pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second is the Tusken yurt, or whatever you want to call it. Of course, it really isn&#39;t that. You have half an exterior, and perhaps even a reasonably believable interior, and the a separate build with a camp fire that connects to it. Now it seems to me that tuskens have their fires outside so it doesn&#39;t really seem necessary to have this attached, I don&#39;t think it belongs inside the yurt. So really you have a yurt facade and a campfire build. But that facade isn&#39;t even good, there are huge gaps at each bend and in the roof, so really you are getting half of a really bad looking yurt. Certainly Lego could have designed a fully enclosed yurt that looks good, with a hinged roof that gives you access to the interior. There was a lot of potential, and it would have been a useful build for Anakin as well, so this is definitely a blown opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build three is the harpoon used to pull out the krayt dragon. From the pictures I thought it was dragon fly at first, but luckily once built it does resemble the harpoon (and also a dragonfly). This is the most creative of the three builds making the most of non-standard geometries and creatively choosing parts to create winches and supports and wheels. However, the build is fairly pointless as there is no krayt dragon to shoot at! There really is no need for a primitive weapon like this in the Lego Star Wars galaxy without a krayt dragon, so these parts could have been much better utilized giving us a better yurt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fairly cheap set so it does make sense for any Mandalorian fans to pick it up, especially considering how few sets have been released to celebrate what is without a doubt the most exciting thing coming out of Lucasfilm. But this isn&#39;t a particularly good set. Kids might have fun firing the harpoon at a Ninjago dragon, and flying the speeder bike around, but I have no doubt that the yurt won&#39;t just end up being spare parts. I really hope Lego starts taking the Mandalorian more seriously. The Razor Crest was great, but the other sets really haven&#39;t hit the mark. I&#39;m hoping that we will soon get Moff Gideon&#39;s light cruiser as that would be something unique and very worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

"grahamcampbell11_yahoo_com","2021-02-06T01:13:48.57Z","All about the Minifigures","<p>I purchased two of these sets. One for myself as an AFOL and one for my 8-year-old son. As a big fan of Star Wars and Mandalorian this set was a must for us, hence two copies. For my 8-year-old son this set would be a 5-star set, over the past month he has played with it constantly and incorporated it into his other sets and makes is the centrepiece of his stop action films.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures and speeder bike are the gems from this set. The best version of Mando yet and The Child included in a more affordable set! If just these were the entire set and it was a &quot;battle pack&quot; for $15 I would have given this a 5 star.&nbsp; The additional Tusken, crossbow and hut seem like some easy stuff to throw in to jack the price up which was done as MSRP is $29.99 USD. I feel like we could have gotten a Bantha or better yet Marshall and his speeder for that price point. But really that is my only gripe, it&#39;s a fun set with very detailed minifigures and speaderbike that is about $5 overpriced in my opinion, but I&#39;m a fan of this series and bought it anyway.&nbsp;</p>

"legostarwarsperson","2021-03-08T16:29:05.937Z","good set, great minifigures","<p><strong>minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set includes three minifigures: the mandalorian in beskar armour, the child/Grogu, and a tusken raider. The tusken raider is the same as in 75270 obi-wans hut, and 75265 t-16 skyhopper and bantha microfighters. It comes with the detailed head mould, which looks great. The child is the same as in the 75292 razor crest, and the 75318 the child buildable statue. It is a great minifigure, and has some great printing on the head and body. The last (and best) minifigure in this set is the mandalorian in beskar armour. He is exclusive to this set, and looks really great. He includes a brown cape, lots of detailed printing on the front and back of his body, and on his legs, and even has arm printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>build</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with three smaller builds: mandos speeder, a tusken raider hut, and a tusken raider ballista. The best build of this set is mandos speeder. It is pretty close to minifigure scale, and it looks great. It includes a bag on the side that grogu can sit in. the second best build is the tusken raider ballista. It has a handle for the tusken raider on the back, and it has little wheels on the back that you can spin around to pretend you are pulling in the krayt dragon. It also includes a spring-loaded shooter, and comes with two of the spring-loaded shooter bolts on silver. Usually they come in transparent green or red, so it&#39;s nice to get them in a different color. The worst build is the tusken raider hut. It&#39;s really only half a hut with a fire pit in the front, and the part of the wall that you do get has a lot of gaps in it. overall it is a pretty boring build, but the other two are good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>playability</strong></p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have that much playability. You can put mando and grogu on the speeder, and they can all sit by the fire pit,&nbsp;and on the ballista you get the spring-loaded shooter, but this set is better if you like just pretending with the minifigures, instead of having tons of features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>value</strong></p>

<p>I think that this set has really good value. It&#39;s not quite 10 cents per piece, but it has three amazing minifigures. This is the cheapest set that grogu comes in,&nbsp;before you would have to pay $80 to get the buildable statue, and this is the only set that the new mando comes in, and he is a really amazing minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This is a really amazing set, that comes with three great minifigures. This set is a must-have&nbsp;for any Star Wars or the mandalorian fan.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-05-20T11:26:09.03Z","Good/Decent builds, Great Minifigures ","<p>I, like many others, was excited about this set mainly for the minifigure(s). I was happy there was a new and much cheaper way to get Grogu and an improved and highly detailed Mando. The builds look pretty alright, but do those 2 figures alone make this set worth it?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Tusken Raider hut:</b> The hut build isn&rsquo;t bad for what it is. I like the campfire, the little pot with a bone in it, and the space to seat figures, it feels like a cozy place. From behind, it&rsquo;s easy to spot the awkward gaps present in the build, but they don&rsquo;t bother me much honestly. It&rsquo;s nothing amazing overall, but it&rsquo;s a pretty decent build. It&rsquo;s nice to see a build that isn&rsquo;t a vehicle within the Star Wars range though.</p>

<p><b>The Ballista: </b>This build essentially looks like a giant crossbow that appears to be fully functional, emphasis on appears. I like the way this was built to show that the bowstring is being pulled back and it&rsquo;s about to fire any minute. What actually fires from the weapon is a spring-loaded shooter with a silver bolt, which always works well for play. Additional details include a non-functional wheel at the front, 3 legs to support the model and a which at the back that could spin, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything, but you could pretend that it draws the bowstring back. Overall, this a very well detailed model that gives you the illusion that it&rsquo;s fully functional and I really like how much effort was put into this, though in terms of collectibility value, this build ain&rsquo;t exactly the best.</p>

<p><b>The Speeder:</b> For a speeder build, this is surprisingly well detailed. There&rsquo;s a small amount of greebling on either side of the speeder, which is a nice surprise for a build of this size. Another nice detail is the use of a few dark orange pieces to represent rust. The accommodation for a driver is fine as expected, 2 clips flank either side of the seat to hold onto The Mandalorian&rsquo;s weapons. Behind the seating area is a brown backpack and a baby carrier piece where you could place The Child to ride along, which just looks great. And finally, I really like the angled parts of the front half of the vehicle. Overall, this is one of the best and more unique speeder bikes I&rsquo;ve seen from the Star Wars range, and it&rsquo;s my favorite build of this set.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>The Mandalorian: </b>Now for the main attraction of this set, the Mandalorian himself in glorious Beskar armor. His torso and legs feature the silver Beskar armor plates with an amazing shine to it, the torso has a brown belt and a sash going around the front and back of it as well. The arm printing is what really makes this figure impressive though. It has a shoulder pad on each arm, and the right one even has a mudhorn head symbol on it which is just amazing. There&rsquo;s also the whistling bird launcher on the left wrist and the grappling line shooter on the right wrist, the attention to detail here is amazing, it&rsquo;s some of the best arm printing I&rsquo;ve ever seen honestly. A grey cape is featured here instead of a Jetpack which I&rsquo;m ok with. The head beneath the silver helmet is just plain black which I&rsquo;m also ok with. Finally, his weapons include a blaster pistol and his disintegrator rifle. Overall, this figure is amazing, it&rsquo;s my favorite Star Wars figure and generally one of my favorite figures in my collection. I can totally see why people would get this set just for this figure.</p>

<p><b>The Child/Grogu:</b> The Child has previously appeared in more expensive sets, so I&rsquo;m glad to get him here. The regular baby body piece is used here to good effect, it&rsquo;s got some printing of fur for his little robe, and the head perfectly captures the look of the onscreen character in my opinion. Overall, this figure is pretty great and I&rsquo;m happy that he&rsquo;s included in a cheaper set.</p>

<p><b>Tusken Raider:</b> The updated Tusken Raider appears here once again after previously being included in 2 other sets. A tan robe decorates the torso and legs, with a diagonal brown belt appearing on the front and back of the torso as well. Of course the specialized Tusken Raider head is used, and the molded detail is great. And as usual with the Tusken Raider figures, the accessory is a gaderffii. Overall, there&rsquo;s not much to say about it, it&rsquo;s my least favorite of the 3 figures, but it&rsquo;s still good, and an appropriate inclusion of course.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set costs R600 in South Africa, and that&rsquo;s just too much. The US price of 30 dollars seems much more reasonable, but for where I live, it&rsquo;s really bad, I wish it was priced lower.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I feel like the biggest takeaway a lot of people have with this set is &ldquo;it has Beskar Mando and baby Yoda, therefore you should buy it&rdquo;. Obviously this set has a great minifigure selection, but if you&rsquo;re only interested in this set for the Minifigs, I think you could skip out on it as I&rsquo;m sure the opportunity to obtain Beskar Mando would present itself again very soon. The builds provided are nicely detailed and pretty interesting, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re missing out on a lot if you don&rsquo;t end up getting this set. However, if you like what you see, then definitely go for it, it&rsquo;s still an enjoyable set that I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to recommend.</p>

<p>Overall, a very expensive set. It should&#39;ve cost around 25&euro; or even less.</p>

Set is separated on 3 different little constructions. One speeder, tusken camp and catapult. First one is pretty great machine with place for placing &quot;Baby Yoda&quot; and our Mando. Tent looks very special. It&#39;s very minimalist and construction looks amazingly great on the shelf. In my opinion catapult looks the worst in the whole set. Beside the playability, it doesn&#39;t look attractive, and it&#39;s not pleasure to build this one too.</p>

<p>In overall, set number 75299 is a great one for kids but also older fans of LEGO. It introduces great mini figures in cheap price and constructions are playable, and they look so minimalist. I would recommend this set for every Star Wars and Mandalorian fans.</p>
