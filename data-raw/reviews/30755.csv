Coming with four detailed min figures, it is a great addition to any collection or fleet.&nbsp;Detailed features, and great playability for kids of all ages.&nbsp;An absolutely great introductory set for beginners.</p>

I didn&#39;t buy any of the previous X-Wings because of the price, but this one is perfect and strikes the right balance between price and size. The wing opening function is a lot of fun and the minifigures are great. General Dodanna is exclusive, Leia is rare, and Luke and R2-D2 are always a welcome inclusion. Definitely one of the best Star Wars sets in a year of great releases.</p>

"graymattr","2021-08-17T19:22:55.643Z","Fantastic X-Wing","<p>I grew up with Kenner Star Wars toys in the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s and would have loved this Lego X-Wing set.&nbsp; Lego&#39;s Star Wars line in 1999 is what got me back into Lego!&nbsp; My three boys grew up with the Star Wars prequels in the early 2000&#39;s and were lucky enough to have a mix of Lego Star Wars and Hasbro Star Wars toys.&nbsp; We&#39;ve had a number of Lego X-Wing sets in the ensuing years and this is probably tied for the best model with set #<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4502-1/X-wing-Fighter"">4502</a> in my opinion.</p>

<p><u>Value</u></p>

<p>This set gives you an extraordinarily detailed minifigure scale X-Wing for a price that hasn&#39;t been seen since 2006!&nbsp; X-Wing models since Episodes 7, 8, 9 came out have cost $80 or $90 and while the piece count is obviously lower with this set, the completed model is barely any smaller and still looks fantastic.</p>

<p><u>Box Contents</u></p>

<p>The set comes in four numbered bags to build the model in four stages.&nbsp; The instruction book is 111 pages long so it&#39;s bound by gluing the pages inside the cover which looks quite nice.&nbsp; However, that&#39;s a disadvantage while building because the pages don&#39;t lay flat while open so you have to add something with weight to keep the book open to the page you are working on.</p>

<p><u>Model Build</u></p>

<p>I thought building this was fun and engaging.&nbsp; This uses the previous method to taper the fuselage.&nbsp; Technic pieces are used to build a mechanical method to open the wings to the X position by pressing down on a piece &mdash; you&#39;ll do it a number of times just for fun to see the wings open.&nbsp; You close the wings by pressing them back together on either side.&nbsp; The lower wings have spring-loaded shooters that kids love to aim at Stormtrooper minifigures.&nbsp; I like how authentic the blasters at the ends of the wings look compared to all other X-Wing models.&nbsp; The cockpit has room for the Luke minifigure and has a printed control panel but it would be nice to have more control panels.&nbsp; The best part about the cockpit is the new windshield element.&nbsp; The landing gear are unobtrusive but they don&#39;t retract like other models do.&nbsp; I quickly noticed a lack of the &quot;t bar&quot; detail on the engine intake like set #<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9493-1/X-wing-Starfighter"">9493</a> had.&nbsp; I don&#39;t care for the nosecone design but the change isn&#39;t distracting I can change that very easily if I wanted to.&nbsp; Guess what &mdash; there are stickers on this set.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like stickers 90% of the time either, but it&#39;s an acceptable compromise to get this set at this price.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>This set includes an updated Luke Skywalker pilot outfit with new printing. He looks perfect.&nbsp; Another new minifigure is General Dodonna for the first time with printing on both sides of the head and torso.&nbsp; It&#39;s great to have him finally.&nbsp; This iconic version of Princess Leia is only included in one other set, #<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75244-1/Tantive-IV"">75244 Tantive IV</a> which cost $200, so this is another benefit for value.&nbsp; (I didn&#39;t buy that $200 set but I did buy the #<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/853948-1/Princess-Leia-Key-Chain"">853948 Princess Leia keychain</a> and removed the keychain just to get the figure!)&nbsp; R2-D2 is also included with the perl silver dome, as he has in many other sets.&nbsp; He looks excellent as always.</p>

<p><u>Parting shot of proton torpedos</u></p>

<p>I am extremely happy with this set and would recommend it to any Star Wars fan.&nbsp; It has some small drawbacks but they aren&#39;t glaring problems.&nbsp; It definitely has more positive points than drawbacks.&nbsp; I realize $50 is not pocket change but compared to the other X-Wing sets of the last 15 years, this version is well worth it particularly since Walmart and Amazon have already dropped their prices less than $50.&nbsp;</p>

"wheetree","2021-04-23T16:32:25.523Z","Disappointed overall.","<p>This is my first review.&nbsp; I&#39;m trying to model it somewhat after the reviews I like to read.</p>

<p>This is my 3rd LEGO X-Wing set.&nbsp; I also have 7140 and 4502.</p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough that I remember seeing &#39;Star Wars&#39; on opening weekend.&nbsp; I had the toy X-wing where you pushed down R2 to lock the S-foils (wings) into the &#39;X&#39; position. When I saw this set had a push-button style mechanism to lock the S-foils into attack position, I knew I wanted it for that nostalgia factor alone.</p>

<p>The price was perfectly in my range.&nbsp; Anything over $50 I might still buy, but feel guilty about it and have to hide the purchase from my wife. &quot;But honey, it&#39;s an investment!&quot;</p>

<p>Minifigs:&nbsp; I love this Leia version with a dress!&nbsp; Definitely the best Leia yet. Luke is a good one with both up and down visor.&nbsp; This R2 version is nice and shiny without being glitzy; I&#39;d like to see a version with some carbon scoring.&nbsp; General Dodonna is a throw-in.</p>

<p>Parts and building:&nbsp; The mechanism is technic and there is a good amount of SNOT making up the exterior shape.&nbsp; The engines are a different design from my previous models, and although they look more accurate, seem flimsy. The new style of cockpit cover is nice. Unfortunately this set relies on stickers.&nbsp; One part I was hoping they&#39;d get movie-accurate but still isn&#39;t: the parabola on the guns is still a dish instead of a &#39;C&#39; shape. Only the UCS versions have come close to this.</p>

<p>Playability:&nbsp; The front landing gear doesn&#39;t fold in/up. So you&#39;ll have to pull it off when you fly away.&nbsp; Even worse, IMO, there is no place to store Luke&#39;s lightsaber. Pushing the button to lock the S-foils out is bit tricky and takes two hands.&nbsp; Putting the wings back into normal flight mode must be done by squeezing them - no button to reverse the action.&nbsp; So overall this disappointed me and was a nostalgia fail.&nbsp; I was hoping for that easy click I had back in the late &#39;70s, early &#39;80s as a kid. It&#39;s quicker than the twist-knob version, but click hinges would be just as playable.&nbsp; The spring missiles are fun, but not as much fun as imagination.&nbsp; I&#39;m surprised they still make the missiles out of the brittle transparent plastic. They break too easily if stepped on (which happens when your running around playing). I wish it came with some kind of mechanic or tools like the original - because the movies showed ships always being worked on when they were on the ground, and it&#39;s a fun way to display them. Or they could have thrown in the briefing table so that the inclusion of the General Dodonna made sense.</p>

<p>Overall pros:&nbsp; They attempted to replicate the classic toy and it&#39;s a great display piece more accurate in its visual presentation than previous versions.&nbsp; Definitely a great Leia, and you get an additional forgotten about character.</p>

<p>Overall cons:&nbsp; STICKERS. No on-board storage for lightsaber or blaster, etc. Engines are prone to fall off during play. Landing gear doesn&#39;t fold. Gen Dodonna minifig doesn&#39;t really fit in without something extra added like the briefing table or similar.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably going to set this up so that General Dodonna is part of a group of minifigs in with the Rebel Control Center from set 7180.&nbsp;</p>

"MathPMaia","2021-12-19T19:58:30.767Z","Decent Set","<p>For around 50&euro; you can get a nice ship, 3 good minifigs and also a good time building the X-wing.</p>

<p>I spent around 2 hours building this set.</p>

<p>I think the price&nbsp;is fair&nbsp;and the new technic that they used for the wings mechanic are pretty creative and interesting to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, a decent set.</p>

"Shaak_ti","2022-05-16T22:34:05.31Z","hard to build at some points","<p>Great set though it can get hard at some points to build but amazing if your looking for a good X-wing this is the one though can get hard. easy to play around with and&nbsp; the best part of this set that MAKES it worth while is that it comes with the CHOSEN one Dodonna Lol thought my biggest problem is R-2-D-2 he does not go in all the way and you cant put the landing Gear up which is kinda bother some&nbsp; and the front landing gear falls OFF ALOT and its gets annoying. but over all great set i would tell you do give your money to lego to GET THIS SET great for star wars fans alike. if your a star wars Nerd like me you will find some problems that don&#39;t go with the movie X-wing but just some small ones though get this set. may the force be with you all ways</p>

"ChrisH7604","2022-08-24T21:53:52.983Z","Red 5/Blue Leader","<p>Got the first one not long after it released and really enjoyed the build. The rather complex Technic build for the wing opening mechanism was interesting but when it all came together was far easier to operate than some mechanisms on previous X-Wings, no elastic bands or twisting pieces here. Two spring-loaded missiles and no stud shooters so less chance of firing off (accidentally or on purpose) and losing small studs. The only disappointing thing with the build was the lack of detail that could have been added with relatively few parts added to the set. I saw a modded version of the set on YouTube so that had to be done, and it made an amazing difference to the set, retractable landing gear, detailed cockpit, detailed engines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures in this set are as expected for Luke&#39;s X-Wing - Luke and R2-D2, plus a very nice Yavin 4 Princess Leia and (for the first and probably only time) General Dodonna which is a bonus in a relatively inexpensive set.</p>

<p>Pros - Good build, interesting mechanism, nice figure selection and loads of playability.</p>

<p>Cons - Poor detailing in the set.</p>

<p>So why did I get a second one? Firstly, I came across one on sale and, secondly, I had an Antoc&nbsp;Merrick figure from an&nbsp;advent calendar. So with a bit of purchasing from BrickLink it was easy to create the Blue Leader X-Wing from Rogue One.</p>

<p>Overall, liking the downscaled sets in this range but they need a bit more detail in places, not a bad price point compared to previous X-Wings. Tons of playability for kids.</p>

"fanoftechnic","2022-06-22T02:24:26.037Z","Excellent displayable and playable set for the money","<p>It is fun to build&nbsp;and contains a very clever and neat technic based X-wing mechanism which uses gravity rather than rubber bands and which is extra fun to build and reason about how it works!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It looks <strong>spectacular</strong> from most angles and is very swooshable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few minus points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&#39;m not a fan of the launchers and feel they can be omitted from the build. The springs rattle which is a little annoying.</li>
	<li>The way the rear of the set is attached to the rest could be made more sturdy</li>
	<li>There is a slight wobble between the wing assembly and the fuselage.</li>
	<li>The attachment of the rear stems of the engines to the wings is a little flimsy (wobbles)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, an immense value for money and a fun thing to have sitting on my desk!</p>
