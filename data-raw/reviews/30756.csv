<p>Apart from that it&#39;s great. The helm is well shaped and the studded look is fine. The tube details and the neck details all work to make this set look great, if not totally accurate</p>

<p>The price is fine in the UK, just &pound;5 more than most of the other helmets, but $70 seems expensive to me</p>

<p>5/5 a must have in your collection&nbsp;</p>
