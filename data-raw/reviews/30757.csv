"TeddytheSpoon","2021-05-02T13:26:26.4Z","Scout Trooper raises the bar for Star Wars helmet collection","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The build: </b>the Scout Trooper helmet starts off similarly to many other helmets &ndash; a core built around a Technic frame piece and SNOT bricks. However it doesn&rsquo;t take long before it deviates from this well-trodden path, dictated largely by the Scout Trooper&rsquo;s angled jowls. These and the distinctive visor make the build a more interesting experience than the stack-plates-on-plates technique found in the TIE pilot or Boba Fett, despite having fewer pieces. That said, the set is not free of this technique, and when making the crown of the head I did find myself checking my work a lot to ensure I hadn&rsquo;t missed anything. The Scout also includes a dozen or so stickers, which scatter some more details throughout the helmet. These details aren&rsquo;t absolutely essential &ndash; in fact around a third of them are on the back, so may not be seen &ndash; but their inclusion does not detract from the build process. <b>8/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Display value: </b>the Scout Trooper is one of my favourite troop designs in all of Star Wars, so it should come as no surprise that I think it looks excellent. Even setting aside that personal bias, however, this is a very faithful representation of the design first introduced in Return of the Jedi. The angularity of the design certainly lends itself well to the medium of LEGO bricks, and as a result the visor and mouthpiece &ndash; two of the most distinctive elements of the Scout Trooper &ndash; are pretty perfect. The rounder elements are equally well done, and the area around the back of the helmet matches that found on the Stormtrooper from the same line. The only area that could have really used improvement is the seam where the helmet can flip up, which is shown here with light bluish gray tiles but doesn&rsquo;t quite pull off the look. This is far from being a deal-breaker though. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>a fine addition to the slowly expanding line of Star Wars helmets. The low piece count makes it one of the cheaper sets in the helmet range, but this not the fault of any design compromises. In fact I would go as far as to say this might be the best headpiece yet from a galaxy far, far away, or at the very least the best value. An engaging build process married with a unique design that is well-suited to angular plastic bricks results in a great-looking display piece, with plenty of visual interest for a mostly-monochrome statuette. If you have ever considered starting a collection of these helmets, you could do much worse than starting here. <b>9/10</b></p>

You can&#39;t really play around with this set, so it&#39;s good for a collator. I do like how it looks alike with the scout troopers from the film. It is a good price and the great part is you can find it for cheaper most places even though lego put it out for 60 some places you can find it for 50 I mean who cares your saving ten dollars? But over all it was a really fun build would recommend for any Star Wars collator. For me, it was easer then I Expected though there still were some hard parts time to time. I do think Star Wars should do Count Dookus head and Jango fetts i mean a scout trooper never got there head cut off oh yeah and Gree Yoda cut his head off to just some Lego requests there but great set LEGO hope you make some more good ones like this may the force be with YALL.</p>
