"rabk295","2008-07-19T06:55:16.107Z","OK....","This set is pretty nice, but it would have helped if my bro hadn't lost the red seaweed thing and the minifig's helm the day he got it. Even if he hadn't lost it, there still wouldn't be much to do with it, but the whole Aqua Zone theme is awesome, fantastic, superb, whichever word you think describes the theme. I just don't think this particular set is that great.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I did not own only one Stingrays set, I also had this one, it slipped my mind while I was typing up that review and may edit it to reflect this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, on to the review. I believe this is the only Stingrays set to include a submarine that does not use the new curved printed Stingray piece in its construction. In fact this submarine is a bit of a more traditional looking one that could almost infiltrate the Hydronauts if it weren't for the obvious Stingray printing on the clear dome cockpit piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is quite compact and almost looks as though it isn't airtight, but since the Stingrays Mini-Figures had heads with gills printed onto them (as I recall.) that really isn't much of an issue for them. The Stingrays are more than likely an aquatic race of men seeking out the energy crystals to power their underwater city and only use the submarines to travel faster. It is truly a shame that Aquazone didn't stick around longer, we might have gotten an actual base for them to use that evoked this idea with open areas where helmetless amphibious Stingrays could mingle with some female Stingrays... Maybe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One could almost see the similarites to a crab in this model too, it has two manipulator arms on the smallish side and a large dome-like cockpit section. However I think the alternative name LEGO gave the model in the other boxed set (#6109) is more accurate for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to recommend this set to fans of Aquazone, if only to build up some more Mini-Figures on the Stingrays side of things. It's also a good set for modification because of the unique pieces and the linked manipulator arms pieces. It's also one of the only sets to include the plant piece in that particular shade of red, I believe it was meant to represent coral. A great if slightly misunderstood set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-06T12:08:43.563Z","LEGO Aquazone (Stingrays) - Crab Review","This set is very easy to build and it has a cool look. It may doesn't have much play features but I think it's a very cool set to have for little money. We get one diver who has a very awsome helmet which I've only seen in this theme. Also the armor on his torso is very nicely done and I also like his evil looking face. This diver comes with a little claw which can hold the silver crystal which we've seen in the LEGO Power Miners and LEGO Rock Raiders themes a lot.<br><br>The sub is very sturdy and we get one arm on each side. One arm has a claw and the other one has a propeller. On the back we get a container where we can store the crystal. The coolest piece of this set is the windscreen. I love the markings with the evil looking fish eyes and the big teeth. The windscreen opens easily but there's nothing going on in the cockpit. This set also comes with a red plant.<br><br>All
in all this set is a grood model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

You also get an underwater bush to add to the setting. A great addition to any underwater diorama.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
