If you do not have an imperial shuttle in your collection already, this is a good one to add. If you already have one, you are not missing out on much. solid ship yet slightly overpriced, comes with three detailed mini figures, a fun build, and a solid end product. Movable top fin that seats two min figures, and accessories, crisp wing movement, and functional pilot window. One large complaint is the main window does not fully encapsulate the pilot, however this can only be seen when looking up at certain directions. Not a must have, but a solid set nonetheless.</p>

"derekp54","2021-03-08T05:29:37.567Z","Average Build","<p>I was happy to see a 2021 release of a simpler Imperial Shuttle and I wanted an Imperial Officer in black uniform. The Luke Skywalker was good also. However, Lego could have been a bit more thorough in the design, under the front canopy are gaping holes on either side. I don&#39;t think most spacecraft do well with the windows down...just saying. I bit pricey for what you get in the box, too.</p>

"StaticIsHere","2021-08-06T18:03:06.52Z","Solid set with a couple notable flaws.","<p><strong>The Figures</strong>: This set includes Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, and an Imperial Shuttle Pilot mislabeled as an Officer. Luke is the same Episode VI version we&#39;ve had since the 2015 Death Star Final Duel, while Vader features the new 2021 torso and legs. Both figures look great, and are nice to get in together in a cheaper set than the 2021 remake of the Death Star Final Duel Unfortunately, Vader lacks the printed arms seen in the aforementioned set. The Pilot looks nice in any Imperial Army, and it&#39;s always nice to get a proper pilot figure for a starship.</p>

<p>While the figures included look great and are all nice inclusions,&nbsp;considering the lack of arm printing on Vader, and considering that the 2021 X-Wing set has 4 figures at $50, at least one more figure should have been included in this $70 set: perhaps a Stormtrooper or an actual Imperial Officer. Right now the figure selection feels a little lacking.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Set</strong>: This set took me about&nbsp;an hour to build at a relatively leisurely pace. While there was some repetition in the builds of the wings, the time spent on these parts was short enough that it didn&#39;t grow boring.&nbsp;Overall it was a pretty fun build.</p>

<p><strong>The Shuttle: </strong>Despite&nbsp;the roughly ~250 piece decrease in size from the 2015 Imperial Shuttle Tydirium, this Shuttle still looks rather good. Looking at this Shuttle straight on, or even from the side (at a downwards angle), it makes a nice display piece. The fin on top looks imposing, and although the two wings could have been just a little bit longer, it&#39;s not too big of a detraction. There&#39;s a bit of a gap between the &quot;head&quot; and body of the shuttle, although it doesn&#39;t look too bad from most angles.</p>

<p>However, when you look at the shuttle from below, or even at the same height, the bottom of the cockpit is somewhat awkward. The technic bricks jutting out make it look blocky, and the cockpit itself isn&#39;t closed off as well as it could be.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is best off displayed somewhere below eye level, preferably with the wings lowered.</p>

<p>This set also has some good playability. For an interior, the&nbsp;cockpit can only seat one figure, but I can see it easily being modified to fit two, like its predecessor. The body of the shuttle can hold two more figures (such as the Luke and Vader included), with room for a couple accessories to be laid down alongside them (although there a no clips to attach them to). The mechanism that keeps the interior closed works surprisingly well - you can lift the Shuttle up by the fin and the mechanism will still hold the body shut (I would still not advise flying it around by the fin).</p>

<p>The shuttle is small enough that it&#39;s easy to fly around, and two stud shooters underneath the cockpit round out the playability.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>For every mark, this set is solid, although it could use some minor improvements.. The figures are good, although they could be improved with a couple minor changes. The build is good, although it could be improved by a couple minor changes. The build was fun, although not anything unique. The&nbsp;$70 price point doesn&#39;t feel too unreasonable, with 660 pieces and a good-sized final product, but $60 may have been a better price, especially with only 3 figures.</p>

<p>If you already have the 2015 Shuttle, then there isn&#39;t much of a reason for you to buy this set - the $100 version is undoubtedly the better set.&nbsp;However, if you don&#39;t currently own an Imperial Shuttle, than I can solidly recommend picking up this set, especially if it goes 20% on Amazon or Walmart later. While it&#39;s not perfect, it&#39;s still a good-looking and fun-to-use set, with some nice figures to get, even if the selection could have been improved.</p>

"npapag","2022-05-10T16:42:44.68Z","Nice try, but not enough.","<p>We know well by now that Lego has begun to reduce the complexity (and relative cost) of various major vehicles, targeting the younger age, leaving the older and more expensive ones for adults. And it succeeds! The famous Lambda Class 75302 Imperial Shuttle is remarkable. However, the interior remains simple, while there is room for detail. The choice of figures is mediocre, if you do not already have Darth Vader. Collectively, i agree with a recent reviewer that Moff Jerjerrod (2016) would be more appropriate. Nevertheless, I think at EUR60-70 (discounted) is a good buy and I&#39;m happy (the original EUR99 is a lot)</p>

"Nerbonez","2021-04-03T00:17:57.497Z","Decent model with good playability, but some flaws","<p>The Shuttle Tydirium is my favourite Star Wars ship. As soon as I saw this model on the shelf I bought it.</p>

<p>The minifigures are good (although my interest is more in the set than the minifigs) and&nbsp;the kids were keen to play with them straight away.</p>

<p>The classic shuttle shape is there, but I found the flight deck module could be better. The structure under the flip up windscreen (space-screen?) section is quite&nbsp;chunky and there are some serious gaps. The windscreen assembly seems a bit small, flat and fragile. The transparent windscreen part holds the top section on and this whole assembly frequently breaks during play.<br />
I would rather forgo the shooters underneath for a better built flight deck, and I am considering ways to rebuild this myself.</p>

<p>However, the body and wings are well-made and quite strong:&nbsp;The top fin and body flip up with a nice rubberised catch to hold it together. The fin is solid and securely fixed.</p>

<p>The wing&#39;s movement is&nbsp;notched, so they stay in the position you leave them. I wonder if there is a way to achieve this without leaving large gaps in the round sections of the body.</p>

<p>The landing feet could also be worked a bit more faithfully to the original, although I understand the earlier versions of this model had problems where they would fall over.</p>

<p>Overall the build was fun and despite its flaws would recommend, especially if you have some scale tie fighters on the shelf.</p>
