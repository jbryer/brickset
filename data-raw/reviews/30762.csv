Some think it is not a great value but once the set is built it looks amazing. The Darth Vader with arm printing is amazing and looks so good. The sticker of the scene when&nbsp;Vader force&nbsp;chokes Admiral Ozzel is a really great sticker. The set could have been a bit smaller and cheaper if there was not such a big display stand for it. You also have the ability to open and close Vaders meditation chamber which is really cool, and make it lock&nbsp;into place.&nbsp;</p>

It has excellent detail and the base significantly improves the whole look. Somewhat expensive (EUR85), and with zero playing value. However, I&#39;m happy with the model and would definitely recommend it to collectors; it perfecty decorates my living room!</p>
