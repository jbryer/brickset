Had I been able to find one to purchase, though, I&#39;d probably have bought it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to be reviewing this more from the perspective of a parent buying for a child looking to get into Technic. I don&#39;t think there is enough here to really interest an AFOL.</p>

<p>For such a small set, I think it offers a great introduction to Technic building. There are a range of connectors and quite a lot of axles used to tie the 2 sides of the model together. This mirrors techniques used in larger, more complex sets.And as there is the dual rotor function, activated by a gear wheel on the underside, it requires a little finesse with the tolerances to get smooth and freely rotating rotors, just like more complex sets with a lot of gears. It&#39;s this mix of building that makes it most recommendable as a Technic starter.</p>

<p>With only 70 parts, the only interesting parts are the main rotor blades, but parts are not really the point of this set. As I wrote at the top, I was actually able to build 2 of these from spares, only needing to add the main rotors. I do think this has an attractive colour scheme, and seems a little less expressly masculine than other Technic sets, so should interest boys &amp; girls.</p>

<p>For younger builders, the dual rotor mechanism offers good playability for a Technic set of this size. My daughter loves it, even though she&#39;s a little young to do the actual building.</p>

<p>With a decent build experience and playability, I think this represents pretty good value for money, and certainly one of the cheapest ways to see if a young builder is interested in Technic.</p>

<p>This one doesn&#39;t. Also, it comes as a polybag and therefore seems to be hard to find. I got mine from a shop dedicated to Lego some weeks ago. Now it also is available from a chemist chain.</p>

<p>The format of the bag is same as small technic sets thus bigger than other polybags.</p>

<p>Only (some of) the lime parts (connectors 6273728, 6366476, 6326619) are to be considered rare as they appear in few more rather expensive sets (e.g. #42115).<br />
I didn&#39;t open my bag but took pieces from my parts instead: I tried to use as many colours as possible this time.</p>

<p>The finished model is of comparable size of 10&euro; technic sets. There is one technical function: The simultaneous drive of main and tail rotor. Take time to align all rotating pieces for minimum friction.</p>

<p>Beside colour variants this set can be modified easily:<br />
I swapped the (thick) 12-tooth gear at the main shaft with a 20t - 12t thin setup to gear up the tail rotor.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is a nice set for beginners at level with technic sets that cost - at least - 2.5 times as much. Customisations are possible as well.</p>

As a kid playing with a toy helicopter, one will find themselves&nbsp;in a challenge to rotate its two propellers at once when imitating its flight - well, not anymore with this little model!</p>

<p>We get a surprisingly massive package with its 70 pieces, and after opening it appears that the smaller bits are even packaged separately in a smaller bag, which I can only see as extra waste. But the instructions are still folded, so the whole assembly had to fit on two pages and in 22 steps - and I love this! Nowadays all the sets come with instructions so simplified you have to add only one part per step, but this reminds me of the older times when even the larger sets had folded instructions - lots of paper spared, although you have to be more careful :D Construction is enjoyable and takes&nbsp;around 10 minutes, which could seem long for a polybag, but this is&nbsp;a Technic set, so it is reasonable.</p>

<p>When the final shape is formulated, the finished model looks just great. The aircraft is massive, the proportions seem fair and the colours go well together. And it wouldn&#39;t be a real Technic set without a function, so there is one (even with this few pieces): the two rotors are connected to each other by some gears, so when one of them rotates, the other does as well. Moreover, the axle of the main rotor is reachable at the bottom, so you can operate the two gears at the same time by rotating that. It&#39;s not an elaborate gimmick, but works neatly, and is very satisfying to see in action.</p>

<p>There is so much potential in smaller sets like that: they can introduce someone to a certain theme or Lego as a whole, and makes it possible to pick up some cool model at a pocket money price. I really cannot say anything negative about this set, except for one: this is a polybag, so it has a limited availability, I also had to buy it at a higher price as I would have found reasonable, and I&#39;m sure lots of people couldn&#39;t get this because it is so hard to find. So if anyone reads this from Lego: make small sets widely available again, pretty please! And also, you could go greener and more reasonable by shortening the instruction booklets at other sets as well :P&nbsp;Bottom line: I can definitely recommend this to anyone who can find this at a reasonable price and loves Lego (and of course you do, why would you read this if you don&#39;t :D).</p>
