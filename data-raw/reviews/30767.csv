<h3>Introduction (About Colour of Technic Parts)</h3>

<p>Teal (&quot;bright bluish green&quot;) was the second blue hue in technic and also the second green one besides the main colours that we had for many years. It has been introduced in 1998 (according to <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Bright-Bluish-Green"">Brickset data</a>) and was used in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Technic/subtheme-Competition"">Competition</a> series. It was also used in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8549-1/Tarakava"">one of the larger bionicle sets</a>.</p>

<p>Since then the colour universe of technic parts got expanded by many different green and blue hues: light, dark, brilliant. And in 2020 Teal reappeared for Mindstorm and now in a technic set, too.<br />
Eventually I decided to buy this set to add the parts to my collection. I got pleasantly surprised: The colour of new parts (panels) nicely matches the old ones (thin liftarms):</p>

<p>I have seen deviations for other colours that I would rate considerable with lime (#42115) as recent example but also with bright red or blue.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The box has similar size as the one from the Skid Steer Loader but 1 cm less height. I guess it is filled by 60..70%.</p>

<p>(tablet size: 60x40 cm&sup2;).</p>

<p>Besides the elements of bluish green colour I didn&#39;t notice any parts that are worth mentioning.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>The process will have you work from engine towards the front, then towards the back and tail, the wings, rudder, and eventually the cockpit. If you prefer structured building: this may not be your set.</p>

<p>I would like to recommend to pay special attention to the drive shaft: The propeller is driven by the landing gear using four gear wheels. Make sure after every building step that the is little to no friction. This will greatly increase the <em>Swoosh</em>-factor of the final plane as the propeller could rotate very fast. The small size of the wheels yield a good number of turns/distance if the plane is pushed on the ground.<br />
<em>(I have built two versions: one from the box and one from spare parts of my collection. The latter has much better transmission. That could hint that newer gears impose more friction to drivetrains - this has been reported for a few recent technic sets.)</em></p>

<p>For the landing gear, small wheels from City sets are put on half bushings as rims. These would be the smallest wheels used in a technic set.</p>

<p>As final step, the cockpit (&quot;canopy&quot;) is build: This is the (relatively) largest non-technic subunit I have seen in recent technic sets:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42117/028_wrn_210411_191036.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 178px;"" /></p>

<h3>Model, Functions</h3>

<p>For this one the size of the final model exceeds the size of the box. The colour combination of white, orange and teal is nice and - for me - works without the stickers.<br />
The scale could fit a Minifig.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42117/033_wrn_210411_191249.png"" /></p>

<p>There is a single function in this set: The propeller rotates if the plane is pushed on the ground. If friction is minimised, momentum will allow to move on for a few (2-3) seconds.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>- relatively large amount of system bricks<br />
- one &#39;function&#39; only<br />
- nice to look at<br />
- swoosh with propeller turning is pure fun</p>

<p>At the sets price (especially when on discount) you can&#39;t go wrong.</p>

<p>(Of course) I built a second plane in a different colour scheme:</p>
