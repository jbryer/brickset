<br />
The building experience is pretty poor, though. The majority of this build will involve putting a lot 2L and 3L connectors of various types into beams and I felt like the instructions were unclear at times about where parts connected with each other and I had to work it out by counting the blank holes on the page and so on. I feel this is where Technic instructions can often be poor, and I am surprised LEGO have not yet found a solution. I can think of a couple of solutions off the top of my head. I also felt the tyres were hard to get onto the hubs properly, but I did manage it in the end.<br />
<br />
On a positive side, this set is really well-designed and fits is purpose brilliantly. Whilst it is a solid model, there is enough &#39;give&#39; in its design (such as fitting the bumper with 2L red pins rather than the circular connectors) that it can weather collisions and rolls without falling apart or being damaged. The energy of collisions is dispersed through the parts really well, and I had no worries about it breaking or being damaged by running into chair legs or off things. The flagpole is a hollow tube so it should bend and flex rather than break if the model somehow landed on it. It&#39;s a very impressive looking vehicle too, and whilst it may not be 100% accurate I think it gets the look of Grave Digger across well enough.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a perfect set, as I&#39;ve mentioned, and it concedes some features and accuracy in lieu of playability. There&#39;s no suspension, the bumper is inaccurate and ugly (but has a purpose) and the way the flag is integrated and held is quite loud and floppy. I feel that if it had been replaced with a cloth flag or a plastic sheet it would look more like a flag and perhaps be less of an issue, whereas the weight of this plastic one causes a lot of clattering.<br />
<br />
But I am 32yrs old and I was going &quot;wheee!&quot; when getting this to zoom across my floor and over obstacles so I think it very much does its job well.</p>
