GET TWO!","This was one of my favourite Aquazone models as a kid and spent alot of time playing with it.This model has so much playability although it may not look like it. The model is quite structurally sound with so many features. It roles on two wheels which allow the crawler to lean over and grab items off the ground. It also has four propellers to get it off the ground. The propellers are held in position by spring loaded blocks which are excellent for positioning or posing. 

Armed for attack with arrows and grabbing arms make it a beast to over power as the arms can reach almost every angle and are perfect for collecting crystals, other vehicles animals and plants.

The cockpit is small due to the top hinging lids size, but inside is enough room for the mini-fig and control panel. The mini-fig is wearing the white jacket with black face shield, which complement the cool face with sunglasses. What the sunnies do under water I have no idea but still look cool. The mini-fig is also equipped with the little daggers, which are one of the coolest weapons around. Also the mini-figs flippers clip on to the back of the vehicle on pegs so they wont fall off.

The only real flaw of this model was the lack of crystals. I mean the title is crystal crawler it could have had at least one. The Aquashark model of the same size got one, why not this little killer? Other than that I can find no other fault, but I may be bias due to my love of this one so if you find one do say something.

Now you may be wondering this model is good but why buy two as my title suggest. Well if you flip to the back of the instruction book you will find this is one of those rare models that has alterations to the model on the back of the book not just on the box. One of this models is actually really good. The one in the bottom left hand corner to be precise. I always liked this one too and have built it before so yes my recommendation is to buy two, so you can have both as it is hard to decide which I like better.

Overall this is a wicked model and as it was fairly cheap to buy in the day it deserves its 9/10 from me. Would recommend this model to any space sea or under water fan. Also it's a great one for any collector or person who likes to display their LEGO.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set&nbsp;is also very playable, as I can roll it across my carpet and pretend its&nbsp;driving across the sea floor.&nbsp; I also like the rotating propeller tubes; the spring loaded piece keeps them in position so you can rotate them with ease and they'll stay in position when you're finished.&nbsp; This additional mobility certainly adds much more to the set, making it something more than just an underwater car.&nbsp; The one major flaw I find with this set is the arms.&nbsp; The hinge elements might have been great back in the 90s, but my experience with these pieces is that they break too easily, and they don't have quite the mobility as ball-joint elements that were introduced a few years later.&nbsp; However, these problems have only appeared with age, and brand new they do add a nice element to the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this set were still out on the market, I would suggest buying it straight away.&nbsp; It's not that easy to find nowadays, but I certainly would recomend getting it if you want to start an Aquazone collection, or rebuild it if you have have the pieces.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-27T11:30:58.727Z","LEGO Aquazone (Aquanauts) - Crystal Crawler Review","Now this is a fantastic small set. It comes with some rare pieces like the big yellow wheels and the printed piece with the sub on it. The built is fun and easy and the set is very sturdy. I really like the way how LEGO did the propellers which you can sviwel on the front and on the back. On each side is an arm which can move as well. The claws of that arms do open. The cockpit is also very nice. The ceiling can be removed and you get a dashboard. This set also comes with a plant which is a nice piece to have. The diver minifig is very cool as well. I think the design of this set is very attractive. It doesn't have many play features but the features which are included in this vehicle are very cool.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
