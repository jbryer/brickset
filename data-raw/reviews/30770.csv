"Duq","2021-01-17T11:48:27.35Z","It's a jeep, but is it a Jeep?","<p>Lego&#39;s Technic licensing trend continues. This time a mid-sized off-roader gets a Jeep badge. Does it live up to that badge? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s start with parts, 665 of them. Pins and 2L and 3L axles make up a whopping 47% of that! So what else will you find in the box? A few of the new-this-year 3x7 panels (3 yellow and a black), the tiny 2x3 panels (3 yellow), two turntables for the suspension and a few non-Technic parts, mainly for lights. What will you not find? Gears! Well... there are 2, a 12T and a 16T.</p>

<p>There are a few printed beams for the trademarked Jeep grille, and a sheet with 14 stickers.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>Parts come in two sets of bags but the split seems rather arbitrary; at the end of bag 1 you have the chassis and part of the body completed. The core you build at the start is as dense and compact as I&#39;ve come across. By step 20 you&#39;ve used 50 parts and the model is no more than 2 inches in any direction.</p>

<p>The build is not challenging if you&#39;ve built Technic before. Front and rear suspension use the same concept of a pendulum axle. A small turntable is used as the pivot, allowing the steering axle to go through. A the back two springs hold the car level. A clever and&nbsp;interesting technique, but not difficult to build.</p>

<h3>Looks</h3>

<p>When you&#39;re finished you have a nice looking Technic off-road car. This one however is branded as &#39;Jeep&#39;. At the end of the instruction book are a few pictures of the real Jeep Rubicon and to me they mainly highlight how little the set looks like the prototype. Most of the proportions are wrong; the roof too low, the grille too flat, the wheel arches too big. The black frame at the back for the soft-top should be yellow, the dark grey angles on the bumpers should be black.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit of interior, with a sticker for the dashboard, and even stickers that go on the inside of the angled panels so the seats have the right Jeep stitching. But then there&#39;s also the axle for the hand-of-god steering through the cabin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The doors have no top half, and strangely seem to be missing another beam at the bottom, leaving a strange gap.</p>

<p>Did I mention it&#39;s small? It&#39;s got some 85 parts more than the Corvette but it&#39;s two inches shorter.</p>

<h3>Playing</h3>

<p>It&#39;s got a good few play features for a small set; steering, suspension, a winch, opening doors and bonnet (even if there isn&#39;t much to see under the bonnet). The hand-of-god steering (the knob is one of the two gears in the set)&nbsp;is at an angle, rather than vertical like on most Technic sets. Given the amount of sideways pushing to activate the suspension I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best choice.</p>

<p>Speaking of suspension. The rear suspension is very limited in its travel. I wasn&#39;t sure why, so removed the two yellow crankshaft pieces and sure enough, the suspension travel improved. Unfortunately the front couldn&#39;t keep up and now the front wheels would jam in their arches when you steer and compress the suspension.</p>

<p>Speaking of steering... The mechanism is simple and sort of effective, but it also has a tiny steering angle, giving the little Jeep the turning circle of Titanic. This has been a Technic problem for decades.</p>

<p>The final play feature is the winch in the front bumper and it&#39;s as simple as they come. The second gear in the set is used to winch the cable in an out, using only the friction of a pin to stop it moving, so you can&#39;t pull any weight until you&#39;re at the end of the string.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is a good-looking fun off-roader. I have no doubt&nbsp;children will have fun playing with it.</p>

<p>The branding however suggests that it&#39;s (also) aiming at adults and here it just falls short; the looks are not close enough and the limited steering and suspension are disappointing.</p>

<p>Building the suspension is interesting but there&#39;s just something wrong about a Technic set without gears.</p>

<p>I wonder why LEGO decided to do this set as a licensed set. Why not do a licensed Creator Expert set for adults that looks the part, and have a cheaper (no license, no printed parts) generic off-roader as a Technic play set?</p>

<p>Is it value for money? Purely on price per part it&#39;s not as good as its similar sized licensed cousins the Senna and the Corvette but ultimately I think it depends on what you&#39;re looking for.&nbsp;</p>

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-04-09T15:28:35.17Z","Solid little vehicle that works well with the others at this scale","<p>There is nothing complex about the building process it is also nicely sequenced: no fiddly sections and everything flows nicely. The build is split into 2 sections with numbered bags, starting with the main chassis &amp; then building the bodywork and accessories finishing with the wheels.</p>

<p>There is quite a nice selection of parts, a few system elements to add aesthetic functions and some nice functional bits underneath. Plus there are a few new elements, although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to warrant buying purely as a parts pack. The main distinguishing feature of the Jeep Wrangler - its radiator grille - is printed, th rest comes as stickers. I don&#39;t feel the stickers are really necessary and haven&#39;t applied them. Those grille prints are across several parts, and they can be printed a little off - it took me a little while to arrange them in such a way to minimise the effects of the printing offsets. My model doesn&#39;t look as obviously out of line as other pictures I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>The suspension mechanism is the main play feature here and it is nicely executed. The rear suspension would have benefited, I think, from a swing arm arrangement to allow both springs to compress together. As it is, both axles work on a rocker arrangement. The steering doesn&#39;t offer a very tight turning circle - I think it can be modified to improve that a little as there is sufficient space for the wheels to turn further.</p>

<p>I also very much like that the size is compatible with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42098-1/Car-Transporter"">42098 Car Transporter</a> so that I can store/display all the vehicles together.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little disappointing that there is no working engine, but the suspension and steering mechanisms largely preclude including one without major modifications.</p>

<p>Overall, then, I think this is a nice model to fit with the line of similarly sized vehicles and is pretty good value for money, even at full price.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42122/035_wrn_210509_102507.png"" /></p>

<p>I decided that I wouldn&#39;t buy the set soon. I am no big fan of technic cars and this one offers few functions:<br />
- steering<br />
- pendular suspension on front and rear axle<br />
plus:<br />
- opening doors<br />
- foldable bench in rear<br />
- winch</p>

<p>This appears to be poor compared with other recent cars of the technic line (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42075-1/"">#42075</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42093-1/"">#42093</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42098-1/"">blue car</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42123-1/"">#42123</a>): These all have transmission including differential and (fake) engine setup.</p>

<p>This set would be of interest because it is the one with most new technic parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-70695"">tractor tyres</a> (5x)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-71709"">3x7 panels</a> (two colours)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-71682"">2x3 panel</a></li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-42163"">2x1 cross block</a> (new in yellow)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, I bought the new parts form Lego shop and ordered all available colours.<br />
Therefore, my version of the Jeep was built using the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Dark-Azur/platform-Technic"">dark azur</a> variant.</p>

<p>According to Brickset database, the box size is the same as 42107, 42106, <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/set-42094-1"">42094</a>, 42079, 42062).</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>Parts were taken from my spares and instruction downloaded from Lego.com using the link provided by Brickset.</p>

<p>The interior of the car is assembled from a plethora of differently coloured parts. This is different from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42114-1/"">Volvo truck</a> (#42114) that is much more complicated.</p>

<p>For several units I thought that these are designed overly complicated and much more solid than required:<br />
- central piece that gets constructed first<br />
- rear axle is a 5M &#39;high&#39; stack of beams and connectors<br />
- block between driver cabin and &#39;motor&#39; area</p>

<p>The final set is of similar size than <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42075-1/"">42075 First Responder</a>.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>I am disappointed by the models main functions:</p>

<p>1. Steering angle is abysmal. Diameter of turning circle is &gt; 100 cm, about 25 cm less than for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42112-1"">concrete mixer truck</a>. There must be a better setup of steered axle than this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42122/041_wrn_210501_132729.png"" /></p>

<p>The 7M beam poses limit to the steering angle.</p>

<p>2. Rear axle suspension. In contrast to the front axle the rear has two (hard) springs. These are attached to a lever so that the spring only gets compressed if the axle is moving towards the chassis. At first, you will notice a large way od travel. However, this gets restricted to (ca.) 1/2M when the trunk is added. I assume that is still sufficient for playing.<br />
This restriction is similarly applied to the front axle.</p>

<p>3. Winch - This is a very basic setup relying solely on the af friction pin &#39;brake&#39;. It is &quot;controlled&quot; by a 16-teeth gear wheel.</p>

<h3>Rating</h3>

<p>My conclusion: This set could be a nice parts pack.<br />
From pictures the yellow = original version would be nice as a display set.<br />
However, I am very disappointed by the technical features.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42122/033_wrn_210509_102553.png"" /><br />
(There are no 3M beams respectively half liftarms in Dark Azur. Therefore, I built front grille and doors in bright blue.)</p>

"Karidian","2021-05-12T03:37:43.513Z","Fun Easy Build!","<p>Bought this kit thinking it would be fun to build and display.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not let down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I finish the build in one day, breaking in between bags labelled 1 and 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions very straight forward, but I do miss the red outline for where to add the parts in each step.&nbsp; This time I used the PDF instruction manual displayed on a large monitor on my work area.&nbsp; This method was a huge improvement over dealing with the large manual and shuffling it around on the desk as i had done with my previous builds.&nbsp; For the winch rope I sealed the knots with clear fingernail polish so the knots wouldn&#39;t unravel.&nbsp; Much simpler build than my other car builds, and it was a real treat to see it coming together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Smaller in scale, but a really nice size to easily display.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of trying some photos outside in the dirt with this one just for fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Really enjoyed building the Wrangler and wish there were more kits like this one.&nbsp; Would be a great first build for a new builder.</p>

"GrandInqusitor","2022-05-04T12:18:11.033Z","After 15 or more years without lego","<p>So I started to look out for new hobby to spend time in the evenings (instead of TV)&nbsp;and I stumbled across some lego commercial and thought cool, let&#39;s see what other products they offer.&nbsp;I scanned different sites and the smaller lego products (City, System)&nbsp;bit too easy,&nbsp;until I stumbled across Technic products. I did not want to go in big with my first set. After all maybe I will not enjoy the progress.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building/Parts</strong></p>

<p>So yesterday I built this, and it took me about 4.5 hours with few pauses included (Dinner etc) Probably 3+h of build time. The build is actually quite simple there are not many systems in it, but it gets a lot done with easy building. (Simple suspension and steering). But being away this long this set gave me some insight how building is changed since last time I touched lego.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>It looks pretty nice in completed state. My only thought would be that front lights could have been a bit more inside the front grill but that maybe would have left some gap in the front. I don&#39;t know what parts lego has nowadays to be able to achieve&nbsp;this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Turning circle is awful, and&nbsp;the winch is more of a display piece. I probably won&#39;t play with it much though :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This set reintroduced me to Lego and I have&nbsp;already ordered next sets to build, with bit more difficulty this time.&nbsp;All in all probably some seasoned technic lovers don&#39;t find this set all that interesting, but it&#39;s a good starter set. I would rate it 4 of 5.</p>
