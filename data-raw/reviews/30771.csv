"WhitandBrandon","2021-02-05T16:13:40.477Z","Fun, Straightforward Build - Good Display or Play Piece","<p>We got this a day or two after release, and my 7-year old son had the build done quite quickly for someone his age on a Technic set after I helped organise the pieces for him.<br />
<br />
I am not sure I would treat the 10+ age designation as gospel, it&#39;s a fairly straightforward Technic Build for those who&#39;ve built Technic in the past. However, I would say if you&#39;re not used to Technic builds, this probably isn&#39;t a great piece to start with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Positives:&nbsp;<br />
- Looks great and is a nice display piece.&nbsp;<br />
- The gear on the top of the car functions as a steering wheel for good playability.&nbsp;<br />
- Incredible value at its $50 (USD) price point, in my opinion.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Negatives:&nbsp;<br />
- Steering functionality could be connected to an actual steering wheel inside the car.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this piece is an incredible value at $50 as it seems like it could easily have gotten a $79 price point, but I could be wrong as there are still plenty on the shelves at our local LEGO store. And I can only believe that&#39;s because of the reputation of Technic pieces being a bit more &quot;advanced&quot; than standard LEGO.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Firstly the technic model is a pleasure to build with reasonable accuracy to the real race car with the front wings an rear spoiler. The build took me roughly 6 hours to build. There are a lot of stickers on this model an believe they need to be correctly attached. I would like to have seen working suspension an a&nbsp;dashboard decal an perhaps access to the motor to .</p>

<p>the design is good an the profile of the models ground clearance is great as race car are. The steering is good altho&nbsp;I think the steering nob could have to placed better perhaps right in front of the windscreen low profile, the doors are nice and open an close smoothly an head an taillights are well positioned.</p>

<p>overall a pleasure to have a model that&#39;s fits on the transporter an as&nbsp;an intermediate build without the price of the larger models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Richard&nbsp;</p>

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-04-10T11:03:46.603Z","Another solid addition to this line of smaller Technic vehicles","<p>I&#39;m enjoying this line of smaller Technic vehicles, and this Mclaren Senna GTR is no exception. It&#39;s a good-looking car, with an enjoyable build and decent functions at this scale.</p>

<p>The build is relatively straightforward, coming together over 3 sections in about 3h. The build sequence starts with the main chassis, then the rear detailing, finishing with the front &amp; cockpit details.</p>

<p>The chassis section is particularly enjoyable, with a nice method of connecting front and rear sections to create the forward pitch of the car. It&#39;s a mid-engined car, and the simplified drive mechanism from one of the rear wheels for the working V8 engine is nicely done: there isn&#39;t enough room to fit a full differential and working engine behind the cockpit at this scale (I know, I&#39;ve tried) and this is a nice solution that I&#39;ll be using myself.</p>

<p>Only downside for me in the overall building is that the engine isn&#39;t constructed and &ldquo;dropped in&rdquo; as a single unit.</p>

<p>There are a few fiddle steps where axles are inserted and centred on single beams, but at least they were all easy to correct at an appropriate point. I would also have liked to see the section representing the windscreen &amp; side windows inserted before the front wings: it was easier to detach the wings first.</p>

<p>There are a few of the new 2x3 panel part <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=71682#T=C"">71682</a> and quite a lot of blue, but nothing unusual in sufficient quantity to recommend this as a parts pack.</p>

<p>For functions, this has the V8 engine (in standard build at this scale) nicely incorporated in mid-engine layout, the hand-of-God steering from a knob on the roof and nice, functional gull-wing doors like the real thing. It is also compatible with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42098-1/Car-Transporter"">42098 Car Transporter</a>, which is nice for play, display and storage.</p>

<p>For what you get here, I think this represents pretty good value for money, even at full price.</p>
