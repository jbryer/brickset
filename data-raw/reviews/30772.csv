The build was pretty hard, and it got frustrating at some points. I had to redo the whole back area because the motor wouldn&#39;t turn the gears correctly. I expected something like this, with me being somewhat inexperienced with technic.</p>

<p>But, after 45 minutes or so of building, playing with the set is<strong> totally</strong> worth it, with&nbsp;the app so&nbsp;easy to work with, having a lot of distance before losing connection with the car, and ability to go on almost any surface, minus grass. The suspension on the front and back&nbsp;wheels works really well.</p>

<p>Controlling gets hard, with only being able to turn while going forward or backward, but I eventually got the hang of it. I didn&#39;t&nbsp;&nbsp;put the stickers on the wheels, because if I ever broke the set to add it to my collection of loose parts, I didn&#39;t want wheels with stickers on them.</p>

<p>All in all, I rate it four stars. The building experience mainly is what dropped it a star, but it&#39;s still fun to see it come together.</p>

<p>That said, at first glance the appeal of this kit is high. &nbsp;An R/C car you can control with a phone app? &nbsp;For $129? &nbsp;I&#39;ll give it a spin (pun oh-so-intended).</p>

<p>Bought the set on Father&#39;s Day, and had some help from my kids in building it (ages 7 and 9). They were pretty frustrated by the process, and honestly, I was somewhat annoyed by the parts of the instructions that were somewhat vague.</p>

<p>Unlike other reviewers, however, I didn&#39;t have to tear the back end apart and re-do it at any point. &nbsp;But I did have to back up a few steps every so often. &nbsp;This is largely due to instructions that could have been better-designed.</p>

<p>Frustrations aside, I was really impressed by the app (it may be an update to the app, but there are&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;different steering modes, one of which is more traditional and separates steering and forward/reverse. &nbsp;I just wish there were some way to swap it so that the steering was on the right hand instead of the left. The achievements you unlock while driving this are pretty awesome too.</p>

<p>All in all, I had a great time with this, and so did the kids. &nbsp;They insisted on each getting to drive for a few minutes before we left for daycare this morning.</p>

<p>Getting through the instructions was the only disappointing part of this build, and now I&#39;m itching for another app-controlled Technic kit to build.</p>

One to part out and one to continue to play with. Lol. The build was easy and went fairly fast, however it was still enjoyable. My sons enjoy playing with it also and considering I let the 8 yr old play with it and even he can&#39;t break it says just how tough and dependable Lego is.&nbsp;</p>
