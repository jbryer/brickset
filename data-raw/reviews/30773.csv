<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the set is a good size and has a good level of complexity for just over 1600 pieces. The chassis build, including the engine set-up follows what is obviously a very similar set-up to other Technic vehicle sets (there are only so many ways to build a chassis and engine to be fair). This is probably the most engaging part of the build as the exterior is on the whole a relatively quick and straightforward process to piece together with the many body panels that are provided.</p>

<p>There are some nicely designed parts including the curved front splitter and the roof that add to an overall superb completed look. The biggest challenge to completing that look successfully is taking the time (and patience) to apply a huge amount of stickers. It does make the final set look very good and realistic, but it would be a great step forward on sets of this cost if LEGO were to provide more printed panels!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are some areas that either design or quality lets this set down and where I marked some ratings down.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The back wheel arch based on the original build instructions just doesn&#39;t look right and there is a large gap between the wheel and the arch. You can rebuild this to lower the gap, however it can impact the playability as the wheel will scrub off the arch.</li>
	<li>The forward wheels catch on the arches when they are turned full lock. I have tried adjusting a few parts with limited success but with not top steering mechanism it isn&#39;t so noticeable by trying to steer from the inside.</li>
	<li>The yellow elements across the windscreen are very flimsily attached and fall off way too easily.</li>
	<li>The biggest issue I have, and the same was with the #42115 Lamborghini Sian, is the differing colour shades between parts. It&#39;s a real shame that LEGO don&#39;t seem to have a handle on this yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion: If you are&nbsp;a Ferrari or motor sport fan&nbsp;then yes I would recommend this one for sure. If you are looking for a great car to build in this price range then I would probably recommend you pick up #42110 Land Rover Defender or #10265 Ford Mustang first.</p>

But now, I realised, that this set quite great. Amazing V8 engine, a lot of useful details, great exterior. Also, it&#39;s very impressing to put this details to your car, because when you doing it you feel yourself like mechanic in the garage. You have 2 sheets of stickers, and it&#39;s too boring to place it on details. At all this set is really great! This set justifies the money, what I&#39;ve spent!:)</p>

"ReaperKraken","2022-02-27T14:05:27.903Z","My thoughts on LEGO Ferrari 488 GTE AF CORSE #51","<p>I recently bought the LEGO Ferrari 42125, and built it 3 days later. The building experience was good, I&nbsp;spent like 6 hours building. I had built the Ford Raptor the day before, so I&nbsp;was almost instantly into it. Of course, I took many pauses,&nbsp;mostly for toilet breaks or to eat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The looks are probably one of&nbsp;if not the best looking and most detailed LEGO car&nbsp;for this scale, I really like it, and it instantly went on display when I was done building.&nbsp;However, it has not so many functions, compared to other cars in this scale. It&#39;s pretty&nbsp;obvious it&#39;s a re-release of the Porsche 911 RSR of 2019, which also didn&#39;t have so many functions, making the Ferrari better in my opinion. If some aesthetics were sacrificed for maybe it to be remote-controlled, the price could stay roughly the same. Although I am maybe making it not look so good, I still really like it and would recommend it.&nbsp;</p>
