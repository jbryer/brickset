With an exclusive Zane figure, love it, and a new legacy Nindroid Drone, basic but great for an army starter or an addition to an already big army. The build is terribly unenjoyable, as it is just not substantial. But for 10 dollars young kids can have a fun fight on the builds with the figures. It&#39;s pretty cool on display too. Overall this set is pretty good. Still wish we got Nya &amp; Lloyd Epic Battles. Still holding out hope for those in the summer wave. Dareth too.&nbsp;</p>

"digi_raptor","2021-05-27T10:17:48.95Z","Zane hair!","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This set is the Zane version&nbsp;of the epic battle sets from the legacy wave. It includes two minifigures; A common nindroid drone which is undesirable and comes in many sets but good for army building, and what I think most people get this small set for, the Zane minifigure. The Zane is a well detailed minifigure with a light blue half mask and his hair. This is a very cheap way to get Zane&#39;s new hair as it is only &pound;8.99 ($9.99).</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build of this set is alright, not the best in this wave but definitely not the worst. It is good for play as it is a sort of nindroid factory that can assemble the nindroid. It has one play feature where you can put the head on the nindroid by using the machine stick at the top to push the head on.</p>

<p>&nbsp; This set, like all the other epic battle sets, contains a small hand powered spinner of the ninja&#39;s colour (for Zane it is white). This can be used to make the ninja spin when rolled against a surface (spinjitzu).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Chainsaw made of a chainsaw piece and a red lightsaber hilt</p>

<p>Ten transparent blue accessories (two of each)</p>

<p>One golden dragon hilt</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall I would recommend picking this up if you need a cheap way to get the Zane hair, are army building nindroid drones (If you are army building I recommend the golden Zane accessory pack more though) or for kids as it is good for play.</p>
