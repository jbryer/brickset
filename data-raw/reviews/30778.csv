<br />
First, I&#39;d like to say, I&#39;m a new member to Brickset, so please excuse me if I&#39;m not &quot;professional&quot; (I&#39;ve been reading stuff from the database since a long time ago, but I really wanted to start writing reviews and stuff recently). I&#39;m from Australia so most prices I refer to will be in AUD.<br />
<br />
Alrighty, now let&#39;s get into the fun stuff.&nbsp;71732 Epic Battle Set:&nbsp;Jay vs. Serpentine is one of four Epic Battle sets released in the Ninjago Legacy 1HY wave, costing $15.99&nbsp;AUD. Each of these sets follow a formula of having one main&nbsp;build, and one smaller build, one little Spinjitzu turntable, and of course, two new Ninjago minifigures for kids to play around with and stage epic duels.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The box is a new shape, a thing LEGO does with these so-called &quot;gimmick&quot; sets to make them seem more appealing. To be honest, they really are. The shape of this box is basically the same for all the other Epic Battle Sets, the only differences being the outline of the Ninja on the front of the box.<br />
<br />
The box art looks pretty good, with Jay and Legacy Rattla prominently displayed on the front. I really like how the box shapes of these Epic Battle sets creates a kind of 3D look. Another thing I really like is how in the middle of the box (where the top of a box would normally be), there is kind of a card duel between the two figures. Both figures have their own sort of action card thing, with some little bars depicting how strong the characters are in the four original&nbsp;Elements of Creation. These little cards are really similar to the original Ninjago card game, with the Ninjago spinners and cards and all that. These details really evoke nostalgia for OG Ninjago fans like yours truly. On the back of the box is a little action shot of the set itself, as well as a small advertisement for the three other Epic Battle sets. Most of the box as a cool Ninjago Legacy background as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents</strong><br />
<br />
The contents of the box are two unnumbered bags of bricks for this set, one instruction booklet, and one little accessories&nbsp;pack.<br />
<br />
The minifigure selection, as mentioned, is Epic Battle Jay, and Legacy Rattla. The figure selections of these Epic Battle sets are based upon which&nbsp;ninja&nbsp;fights which villain in what season, for example Kai battles the Skulkin in Season 1 so those two are paired up in their own set. Lloyd was the mascot character for the Ninjago Season 1: Rise of the Serpentine, but since there are only 4 of these sets and Lloyd is absent from this lineup, Jay is paired with the Serpentine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Epic Battle Jay</strong> comes with a newly designed ninja gi. I didn&#39;t really like all the white at first, but the suit has grown on me. I really like the simplistic design. The front of the torso exposes some of Jay&#39;s chest, and has streaks of blue running across the white, which does resemble Jay&#39;s element of Lightning. Similar designs continue onto the top half of the legs, as well as a nice belt design with some material that seems like bamboo. A diamond shaped blue badge is present on both sides of the torso, a small one on the left of Jay&#39;s chest, and a bigger one on Jay&#39;s back. On the badge&nbsp;is &quot;VS&quot; written in Ninjargon, which is a nice touch. Jay&#39;s hairpiece is&nbsp;not common nowadays so it is nice to get in such a cheap set. He also comes with a blue half mask.<br />
<br />
His weapon uses a nice golden dragon hilt piece, first introduced in the Ninjago Hunted wave of sets, with a cool new piece attached to it. This piece is from the small weapons pack which contains 10 ninja weapons: two swords, two scythes, two nunchucks, and four shurikens, all&nbsp;in yellow, designed for Jay. The same pack is used across all the Epic Battle sets, albeit with a change of colour to match each ninja,&nbsp;providing a variety of weapons for each ninja to wield, which kids should love. All the pieces do come with a really special design, which makes the weapons look as if they are mid-swing. I like this cartoony feel. The weapon pieces can be swapped onto the hilt with ease, depending on which weapon you&#39;d like to use, except the pairs of shurikens which can&#39;t be attached to the hilt but can be wielded on their own.<br />
<br />
<strong>Legacy Rattla</strong> is a new figure for this wave, although he has later appeared in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71739-1/Ultra-Sonic-Raider"">71739 Ultra Sonic Raider</a> in the 2021&nbsp;Ninjago Legacy 2HY wave. He uses an old hairpiece brought back for Legacy, but this is the first instance of this piece not being printed. I don&#39;t really appreciate this, because we know Lego does do printing on these types of pieces, as shown on Lasha, Rattla&#39;s Venomari&nbsp;counterpart.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, he does come with nice printing on the torso and legs, as well as a sly grinning expression on his head. His colour is now sand blue instead of the original grey, which is a nice upgrade. His hands are black, but I think they should&#39;ve been dark blue instead to match the overall colour scheme. There is also some nice armour printing on Rattla, over some snake scales, and there is a nice faint yellow design on these scales too, depicting a snake&#39;s head. Rattla wields a simple two-piece bone dagger in this set, which is made from a brown hilt piece with a white fang piece.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>The completed models</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The first build</strong> is the bigger &quot;main&quot; build, and it is a menacing black statue snake head with some kind of body, in a kind of bamboo forest setting. The body build uses some nice pearl gold ingot pieces which I personally love getting because they are really useful for Ninjago MOCs.&nbsp;On it&#39;s right are two bamboo sticks, and I really appreciate of the one further back, and how it leans out a bit and seems more natural. On the other side of the build is a simpler design that seems to be connected to the centre snake head build, and its a small black scope with a black wisp piece, previously used on an Oni figure from NINJAGO Acc. Set 2019 853866. It&nbsp;seems to represent either the tail of the snake statue or a wisp of black smoke. Either option seems appropriately&nbsp;creepy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>The smaller side build</strong>&nbsp;has some&nbsp;bamboo stalks, and those sit on a simple mechanism which makes the bamboo fall onto its side when pushed. I really like this design, as a similar feature was present on the first ever released&nbsp;mainline, Ninjago set&nbsp;2258 Ninja Ambush, in which a slightly larger version of the falling bamboo could be activated when someone pushed on a lever to launch Kai. The launch feature is not present in this set&nbsp;of course, but I appreciate the little reference.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Last but not least, there is a small <strong>Spinjitzu turntable</strong>, an&nbsp;added play feature. In the original Ninjago: Legacy wave in 2019, there were bigger versions of these, but for the sake of keeping the piece count down, LEGO decided to include shrunk-down versions of those in these Epic Battle sets. Each of these turntables have a small handle built from two 2x2 cylindrical&nbsp;bricks attached to a short Technic axle piece which is in turn attached to a simple build that features some pieces new for 2019. This build is&nbsp;unlike the older version which had a longer handle with the same pieces. Personally, I prefer a longer handle, as this shorter handle is a bit easier to lose. If you have some of the newer Spinjitzu spinner gimmick sets, you could attach some of those onto the turntable for more of a Spinjitzu effect. There is no doubt that kids will find these turntables fun to play with and mimic the art of Spinjitzu.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
This small set contains enough materials for a child to create a small Ninjago battle between good and evil, with a small build for each minifigure. The falling bamboo sticks and the Spinjitzu turntable are the only play features but they are sufficient for this set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts</strong><br />
<br />
The piece count for this set is the highest out of all the 10&nbsp;dollar Epic Battle Sets, and this fact alone&nbsp;makes this set most worth the price, although the other sets really aren&#39;t that far behind. All the Epic Battle sets this year follow the same basic format as mentioned previously, and I think all of them are executed similarly well. My personal opinion is that this set ranks second&nbsp;out of all the Epic Battles, but you may well have other opinions. I would recommend this set to any Ninjago fan who enjoyed Rise of the Serpentine and would like a Legacy remake. Jay&#39;s new gi alone motivated me to purchase this set. I gave rated this set an overall 4, because I think it&#39;s near perfect, with little left to be desired.<br />
