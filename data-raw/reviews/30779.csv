This set comes with 2 minifigures, a weapon pack for Cole, and a small build for them to interact with.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes 2 minifigures, Cole and a ghost warrior. Both minifigures are new for this wave and Cole is exclusive to the set, and I must say, these minifigures are exceptionally well-designed. Cole has a new suit for this set like the other ninja from their epic battle sets. It includes an orange mask and his hair. The torso and legs have new designs for Cole, and they&#39;re beautiful. The mix of black, orange, and tan works really well in this situation and the under wrap makes this set feel a lot more spooky as a whole. Taking a look at the ghost warrior, he may not be as good as Cole, but still a very nice minifigure to receive in such a small set. The legacy mask in dark blue with purple accents is very nice and quite useful as well. While his other pieces may not be as nice, they&#39;re still useful in their own ways for other minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Accessories&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Cole&#39;s accessories included in this set are amazing. You get every weapon a ninja need and extras! Each epic battle set includes one of these weapon packs in a different colour, and Cole&#39;s has black. These are definitely my favourite colour for these weapons although not the most useful in other situations. The ghost minifigure includes a rake, which is odd but funny as well.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Taking a look at the build... this isn&#39;t good. Its quite flimsy when attaching the roof on, and I find it crumbling very easily when any amount of pressure is applied. I must admit though, the colours are very nice and add to the spooky aesthetic of the set. I think the lantern is too big and while it doesn&#39;t affect is stability, it adds an obstacle for putting figures on the build. I found the egg in the middle funny, but it&#39;s also an obstacle for posing figures.&nbsp;The little hot dog table (?) is quite odd and im unsure why its included, but the sausage in sand green is nice to see again. There is also a spinner to put Cole on, which is a nice inclusion for play.</p>

<h3>Packaging&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Ninjago gimmick sets always come in unique boxes, and these do not disappoint. On the frond you see Cole fighting the ghost warrior in a dynamic pose, and on the top view there is a reference to the original spinner card where you can see the characters stats. And on the back is images of the full set itself.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>71733&nbsp;Epic Battle Set - Cole vs. Ghost Warrior is&nbsp;a very nice figure and weapon pack. but that&#39;s all it really has, good figures and accessories. The build is very flimsy and lacks good places to hold figures for them to fight, and parts of it felt very unnecessary and only included to make the piece count higher. Overall, I&#39;d rate this set a 5/10.</p>
