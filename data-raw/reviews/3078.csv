No stickers in this set(unique blocks) the hose was a first for my collection at that point in time. Could have had another diver or two but with other sets its no big deal. Overall a solid set with character.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the compass, the figure, and the peices, but the overall appearence of the set is sort of ugly.  THe cockpit design is cool, and the ship can be rebuilt into pretty much anything.  THe goods and the bads didn't stop me from getting it.  Lots of playability and possibilities.  great set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The green cockpit is cool and so is the desighn printed on! The magnet is really cool. The wheels are a little small for it though! The silver crystal is great! I would get it if I were you!
