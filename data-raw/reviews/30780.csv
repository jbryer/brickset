<p>Along with the other Ninjago Legacy sets this year, I was sure to get this set as it includes one of the sought-after 10-year anniversary Ninjago figures. Along with the Golden Lloyd figure, the elemental masters stood out as these figures were the first renditions we&#39;d ever got&nbsp;of these important characters.&nbsp; All together, this was sure to be the first 10-year Ninjago set I would buy.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything too notable about this set&#39;s build process. It&#39;s pretty standard, albeit enjoyable. It took me less than an hour to build, which is expectable for a $30 set.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed build is much larger than I expected. I don&#39;t know why I was so surprised, seeing as the size of this is regular for a set of this price. Still the build looks great on Display. The first floor has a spinning turret with some unique green blade pieces, new for 2021.&nbsp; The Book of Spells is showcased prominently on the left side. In the center, there is a rack for holding more green blades, and to the right of that is a crate. On the end, there is a cool-looking plant.</p>

<p>The upper floor is mostly bare to make room for action taking place. A few flags are hung up, which are particularly well-designed (Great job, LEGO graphic design team!).&nbsp; On the side of these are some egg-looking sculptures, one of which contains a green knife. The center holds three more jade blades, and the right&nbsp;end of the second floor mirrors the left end.</p>

<p>A red and black handle is included, where you can mount a spinjitzu tornado (this time colored gold on the bottom and trans-clear on the top).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The most collectible minifigure of this set is definitely the Golden Lloyd. He looks great with the new hair and headband mold. He reuses the golden sword-holder from the first few seasons of Ninjago and the pair of legs from the other golden figures.</p>

<p>The three elemental masters present are the first variants of these characters that we&#39;ve ever got. Bolobo is one of my favorites, using a piece from Monkie Kid to complete his staff. The face underneath his beard seems a bit inappropriate, but since it is mostly hidden, it&#39;s forgivable. Jacob also stands out, especially because of the gold accents on his teal torso. His guitar is great as well, this time in white. Gravis is my favorite of all of these. He uses a turban piece in dark red, as well as 2x2 disc pieces to represent his gravity powers.&nbsp; The dark red on the torso and legs really complements the gold and bronze highlights on his chest. All three of these figures have alternate face prints.</p>

<p>Kai and Jay are both here too, in their Jungle Legacy outfits. The use of dark red on Kai and light blue on Jay make the suits look unique. These are certainly some of the best Ninja suits we&#39;ve received from LEGO.</p>

<p>Eyezor completes this set of minifigures. His Mohawk and silver eye are his defining features, both of which are executed well. He comes with a bone axe.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison to Original</strong></p>

<p>*Disclaimer: I don&#39;t own the original set, so this comparison will take from pictures*</p>

<p>The original Dojo Showdown set was pretty similar to this, only $5 less expensive. It certainly had more traps and play features than this one does, but I like that the focus for the Legacy one is more for display than play. There are plenty of good features on the original, but I prefer display value over play value.</p>

<p>It also included unique elemental masters, in that case, Karlof and Griffin. It included only one Ninja figure and one villain figure, so the Legacy remake wins in the minifigure department.</p>

<p>The new Legacy set refined the old one and made it a better display piece&nbsp;and minifigure pack, a change I am happy for. This is another win for Legacy,</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>At $30, this set delivers on&nbsp; the value. The piece count may be a bit low, but for how large the structure is and how valuable the minifigures are, I think it makes up for it. There is still some good play value, with the spinjitzu tornado and plenty of room to place minfigures.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great minifigures</li>
	<li>Good display set</li>
	<li>Decent play value</li>
	<li>Cheap price</li>
	<li>Collectible Golden Lloyd</li>
	<li>Great stickers and parts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mediocre price to part ratio</li>
	<li>Hardly any villain figures</li>
	<li>Less play value than original</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>In the end, this set is a clever re-imagining of the original Dojo Showdown set with better minifigures and a better display model. I&#39;d recommend this set even to someone who didn&#39;t want the collectible golden figure. This is certainly a must-buy for the figures alone! In the end, it&#39;s a great set that satisfies me in almost every way.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2021-07-25T18:47:00.97Z","Great value - if you like the minifigures and the parts","<h2>Introduction and Summary</h2>

<p>One of the Lego Series I like to collect is the Ninjago Legacy sub-theme, including the six Ninjago 10 Year Anniversary Golden Ninjas. Set 71735 Tournament of Elements is part of that series, but I did not look forward to getting this set in the way I looked forward to getting some of the others. When I saw it for a discount in a local store, I decided to pick it up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now having built this set, my mixed feelings were confirmed. There was nothing special in the construction of this set. On the other hand, the minifigures are a big plus, and I can see some of the pieces included being of great use to MOC builders. The original, Set 70756 Dojo Showdown, was similar in piece count and price. I do not have that set, therefore I cannot make a 1 vs 1 comparison between the two.</p>

<p>Personally, if you need to complete the collection, or you are interested in the minifigures - definitely the strength of the set - or some of the pieces for MOCS, I can see why this set would be fair value for money.</p>

<h2>Build Experience</h2>

<p>For some reason Lego has decided that this sets needs THREE numbered bags, for less than 300 pieces in total. I consider it a complete waste of plastic, and IMHO only serves to highlight the repetitiveness of the build - you basically build three identical structures, and the centre top. The builds are also very simple. Overall this is not a set you buy for the build experience - which would last about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>There are a few pieces people might like as parts for their own MOCs, most notably the bright green weapons set. There are a few stickes included, which IMHO really enhance the final result: two are banners and two are used to decorate a&nbsp;book and its pages.</p>

<h2>The Minifigures</h2>

<p>The Minifigures are the best feature of this set: you get seven (!) minifigures, which is three&nbsp;more than in its 2015 predecessor. Even better, four&nbsp;of them are unique to this set, and three of these characters have never featured in a Lego set before.</p>

<p><strong>Jay - Legacy Rebooted:</strong>&nbsp;This version of Kai is also found in <strong>set 71737 X-1 Ninja Charger</strong>. I like the design of the torso. It is nicely detailed, without the detail being overwhelming. The sash is nicely continued on the legs. The print is in register. The face prints (he has two)&nbsp;and hair of Kai are identical or similar to many Kai heads and hair pieces find in other recent sets.</p>

<p><strong>Kai -</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Legacy Rebooted:</strong>&nbsp;Again a common version of Jay, found in two other sets: <strong>71704 Kai Fighter </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>71737 X-1 Ninja Charger.</strong>&nbsp;I am not sure I have seen him with this staff weapon before (might be me though). His torso is of different design than Kai&#39;s, but I think it is equally well done. I like how the torso print is continued on the legs. The print seems to be in register as well. His facial expressions (he has two face prints) have been used before, as has his hair piece.</p>

<p><strong>Eyezor</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Eyezor can also be found in <strong>set 71736 Boulder Blaster</strong>, <b>Juniors set 71740 Jay&#39;s Electro Mech</b>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>set 112112: Jay vs Eyezor</strong>&nbsp;blister pack. Eyezor himself is not a completely new character, having been included in&nbsp;<strong>set 70746 Condrai Copter Attack</strong>, released in 2015. Compared to the 2015 minifigure (going by the Brickset image) the only element identical between the two is his mohawk. His face, torso and pants have been updated, and differ in detail. The design&nbsp;of the 2021 version is very well done. A whole lot of busy detail, without it overwhelming the minifigure. I like his facial expression. As he only has a mohawk, he has no second face print.&nbsp;Many of the details are quite subtle. A minus is the bleeding of the black undercoat through the torso print, though I have seen worse. Still, I would LOVE to have Lego solve these issues.</p>

<p><strong>Jacob (Pevsner):</strong>&nbsp;Jacob is one of the figures that is completely unique to this set; there is no previous iteration of him. The design of the figure is awesome: he could be the Legofied version of someone from a 1960s/1970s band - and could be used in any Lego display outside of the Ninjago Universe. The print on the torso is very detailed and busy. There might be a little bleeding through of the teal torso. As Jacob has the short children&#39;s legs, there is no leg print. The guitar is beautifully done. I like the completely over the top star glasses for both his facial expressions as well as is Afro hair piece.</p>

<p><strong>Gravis:</strong>&nbsp;Gravis is unique, and has not been released before in the Ninjago Universe. He seems to be sending out some kind of &#39;rays&#39; or &#39;waves&#39;, which is made possible by the use of the <strong>3.2&nbsp;shaft with knob</strong>&nbsp;which has been introduced in recent years. Because he is wearing a turban, Lego has been able to give him two face prints, which are expressive, and thankfully also quite different. There is only a highly detailed print on the torso, which seems to be inspired by traditional Indian garb. I like it.</p>

<p><strong>Bolobo:</strong>&nbsp;The third completely unique minifig, like Jacob and Gravis. He seems to be a reincarnation of Robinson Crusoe, and could just as well figure in a tropical island set. He has a beautiful and intricate tattoo on his upper body (front and back). I like the belt with feather. The print on the legs is quite nice as well. He carries a nice staff, which could just as well have been ripped from a bush or tree. His two rather different facial expressions are mostly covered by his massive hair with full beard piece.</p>

<p><strong>Lloyd - 10 Year Anniversary Golden Ninja:</strong>&nbsp;This is one of the six Golden Ninjago figures included in six Ninjago Legacy sets (yes,&nbsp;<strong>set 71741 Ninjago City Gardens&nbsp;</strong>is a Legacy set!)&nbsp;to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Ninjago Theme. It comes with its own small stand, similar in design to that of Golden Ninja Kai, only with a green accent. His legs are similar to Kai&#39;s, where his torso has a different pattern, and has green accents. The design is intricate but subtle, with some of the gold en bronze printing only visible if the light hits it just right. The print is nicely in register. I like his hair piece (only a green strip of cloth keeping his hair a little in check. His face (dual print) seems to be the common Lloyd dual print face. Overall, this is definitely a very nice minifigure to add to your collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The build is very simple;&nbsp;to me it seems to be less of a platform for play than the 2015 original, and more of a stage background. For a stage background it does look&nbsp;really nice. If you were to exchange the green weapons for something else, it could also be easily integrated in a larger display.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is clearly meant as a play set. It includes a Ninjago spinner as well as one of those &#39;battle sticks&#39;. There is no space on the structure to properly place all six (or seven if you include Golden Lloyd) minifigures. Yet the amount of minifigures and the subject invites play. Unfortunately - unlike in the 2015 iteration - the minifigures cannot walk &#39;through&#39; the structures and the stages of the exercise circuit. The can merely walk towards the various items (books, training pole, weapons stand).</p>

<p>As a display piece, it can serve as a small conversation piece on a desk, or be integrated into something bigger. The latter is IMHO a necessity if you want to include the minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>

<p>Personally I find this set difficult to grade. IMHO it is a pretty good set, especially when you look at all the minifigures included. On the other hand, especially the structure feels lacking a bit. Yet the overall package is very nice. It also seems fairly unique as a Legacy set, since most of the Legacy sets are either considerably bigger, smaller or only are a re-imagination of the original sets from 6 or more years ago; often the Legacy set and its source of inspiration have different price points and piece counts as well - which is not the case of this one. As such, I think the resulting re-imagination is quite satisfying.&nbsp;Personally, I consider this is a pretty good set to get, especially if you like minfigures and can find it at a discount.</p>

"xccj","2021-08-23T07:33:40.327Z","Gathering All the Elemental Masters","<p>The Tournament of Elements season was one of my favorite of the Ninjago show, so it&rsquo;s cool to see a legacy set recreating scenes from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the actual building isn&rsquo;t super impressive; it&rsquo;s a similarly angled interior design that we&rsquo;ve seen in other cheap Ninjago sets before, with the benefit of being two levels to allow for some vertical action.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s fun placement of the various jade blades (including some hidden inside the white vases) as well as a compartment for the McGuffin book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, but it works for the price, so I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>The minifigures are the obvious draw to the set, as you get a whopping 7 of them, including three brand new Elemental Masters for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously you need some of the Ninjas; Kai and Jay appear in their tournament outfits that are used across the Legacy theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chase fig in this set is Golden Lloyd, one of six golden figs placed throughout the Legacy sets that you&rsquo;ll need to buy all of to form the full team.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I know I&rsquo;m hooked on it, doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t recognize the marketing ploy.)&nbsp; You also get a Spinjitzu tornado and a handle to spin it around, a fun function to include in these sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also Eyezor makes an appearance as a filler baddie.</p>

<p>The main draw are the three Elemental Masters: Bolobo, Gravis, and Jacob.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolobo&rsquo;s main feature is his beard, but he has a bare torso with some tattoos printed on him, and carries his plant staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravis has a simple red outfit and turban, and his gravity powers are represented using purple dishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob, meanwhile, has a snazzy teal suit and his sonic guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, they help fill out most of the cast of Elemental Masters.&nbsp;&nbsp;(We&rsquo;re still missing Chamille though.)</p>

<p>As a build, this isn&rsquo;t the most impressive set.&nbsp;&nbsp;But man is it packed with figs, so I think it is very much worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the figs are varied enough that even non-Ninjago fans can appreciate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also like the green weapons pack included here.&nbsp;&nbsp;So very worthwhile one to pick up.</p>
