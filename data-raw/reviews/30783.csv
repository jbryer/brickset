<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Legacy Possession Zane: Nice remake but it&#39;s missing something, the draw to me is the&nbsp; hair-piece in flat silver.</p>

<p>Legacy Soul Archer: Don&#39;t like this one, he is just generic compared to his older version.</p>

<p>Legacy Ghoultar: Decent, but the face print is the same as Soul Archer&#39;s.</p>

<p>Golden 10th anniversary&nbsp;Jay: Amazing! This is a celebratory minifigure for the 10th anniversary of Ninjago, and I got to say, it delivers. It would be nice if it came with an exclusive Golden face print.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability and Articulation</p>

<p>For playability, we have a silver spinning blade, spring-loaded shooters, hidden BOO-sters (cleverly made with a beehive piece in gun-metal grey)&nbsp;and a big golden blade.</p>

<p>For articulation there are 3 points of movement on each leg, 2 on the arms, rotation wrists, adjustable fingers and a pose-able head. I think they should have added waist movement.&nbsp;Oh, yeah, and KNEES! The knee joints are a creative technique that uses 4 (8?) ball and socket connections, that I haven&#39;t seen anywhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Not much to say about the parts, only a few&nbsp;are rare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience and value</p>

<p>Fun build that took me about 2 hrs to construct, a bit of repetitive building with having to build 2 arms and 2 legs, but it&#39;s all good. As for value, with the last few Ninjago mechs of this size I believe this is the best one for the price (for $20 less than Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech you get about the same amount of parts).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall thoughts</p>

<p>This set is very good for what its worth, you get 3 exclusive minifigures, plenty of articulation and tons of playability, all for the best price. But compared to the older version of this set, it doesn&#39;t stand out much. I recommend this set very much and I rate it a 4 out of 5.</p>

"sct","2021-05-31T10:22:25.6Z","Good for display, bad for play","<p>This set looks very nice. I loved it the moment I saw it. I couldn&#39;t wait to get it and build it and let my KFOL play with it.</p>

<p><strong>The build </strong>was OK. Nothing exceptional, nothing bad. The head and knee&nbsp;joints were interesting.</p>

<p><strong>The model </strong>is actually mediocre. The hip joints and, especially, the&nbsp;feet joints are too weak and the model wiggles a lot. It&#39;s unstable,&nbsp;and it is difficult to make it stand straight.</p>

<p><strong>Parts </strong>are OK&nbsp;too. Good amount for the money, some ninjago-unique pieces, some technics parts. Nothing special, though.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong> is where is the set lacks most. <strong>It breaks very easily</strong>. You barely have a place to grab it without some pieces falling off. All the armour plates are very weakly attached and fall off constantly. Leg armour plates fall of when you spread model&#39;s legs wide.&nbsp;Arm plates fall off when you try to move arms. I told my KFOL to put all the fallen-off pieces to a heap in one place, and after each session the heap is significant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for money</strong> it&#39;s a large set, and it&#39;s reasonably cheap. Lots of parts, though most of them are decorative, not construction bricks. If you want it on display only,&nbsp;it&#39;s perfectly fine, great even. For playing - I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;good to put on a shelf, bad for playing</strong>.&nbsp;It&#39;d be 3 stars from me,&nbsp;but I add 1 additional star for the unique minifigures.</p>

"Spruce","2021-06-02T20:35:18.367Z","Zane's Titan Mech Battle, LEGO set 71738","<p><b>Pre-Release Thoughts</b></p>

<p>Similarly to my reviews of the many of the other Legacy sets of this wave, I bought this set for the Golden Legacy Jay. I wasn&#39;t really interested in much else, except for the exclusive Possession Zane.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>I had quite a fun time building this set. Nothing much stood out, but it was a pleasant experience. I would recommend that you give this to someone that is 9+.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed mech stands quite tall for a mech of only $60. There is extensive detail put into every part of this set. The &ldquo;helmet&rdquo; for the mech is small, yet provides great articulation, as you can make the helmet turn from side to side and up and down. Spring-loaded shooters are placed on both sides of the cockpit, with a large range of up and down movement. The cockpit is detailed quite well, although it is a bit difficult to fit a minifigure in there.</p>

<p>The chest area is probably the worst part of the mech, as red and black are visible, which contrast with the main white and sand blue color scheme. Continuing onward, the legs are sturdy and provide good articulation. The standout feature of them is the fact that they have functional knees, which can move back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arms are also well-made, with a lot of medium azure in their builds. The shoulders use the large triangle pieces in white for shoulder pads. The right hand has a movable sword attached to it. The left hand is armed with a silver saw; unfortunately, there is no gear piece for easily turning the saw. The mech&#39;s fingers are built uniquely, using a 1x1 modified piece with a hole in it attached to a modified 1x2 with a bar attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The standout exclusive figure here is Golden Jay. He uses the armor used for the Prime Empire to great effect. Along with Jay, Zane is included in a revised Possession suit. It looks excellent, this time using more chrome silver.</p>

<p>The ghosts are just about what you would expect. Ghoultar is present, although the only difference is the armor. Ghoultar&#39;s weapon is especially cool, using the ghost blade piece introduced a while ago, this time in trans-green and purple. Soul Archer is re-used from the $10 Cole vs. Ghost set.</p>

<p><b>Comparison to Original</b></p>

<p>*Disclaimer: I don&#39;t own the original set, so this comparison will take from pictures*</p>

<p>The original titan mech was priced at $60, but it also includes two mechs and a few side builds. This already gives the original an edge. The play value on the original is much higher due to the inclusion of more enemy builds.</p>

<p>The display value is certainly better for this build, as it has a higher calibre of detail. However, the original has decent displayed presentation as well. The minifigures are at about the same quality, but the original gets the win on this one as it has more.</p>

<p>The original set was tried to me more&nbsp;of a playset, and it accomplished that perfectly. The new version focuses more on making one really cool mech, and it completes that goal as well. These two are pretty evenly matched in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>This set is priced at $60 and has well over 800 pieces. I think the value for volume and value for pieces is perfect here, as the model is large and very detailed. The play value is also fitting for a set of this size, although I wish some&nbsp;parts for the mech would&#39;ve been redistributed to an enemy build.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Good price per piece ratio</li>
	<li>Exclusive Golden Jay</li>
	<li>Great figures, especially Possession Zane</li>
	<li>Interesting play features</li>
	<li>KNEES!</li>
	<li>Fun build experience</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Expensive</li>
	<li>No enemy build unlike original</li>
	<li>Only 4 figures</li>
	<li>Some parts may be fragile</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this set manages to improve upon the original mech, although it may be a bit lacking in play value. I think this set will go down as one of Ninjago&#39;s better mechs, and also a great set. I would recommend this for the Golden Jay and for anyone who wants a good mech for their kid to play with or to display.</p>

<p>Probably one of the top reasons i got this set is because it came with that awesome zane figure! The deep stone zane figure looks awesome, and the colour contrast is phenomenal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AND THE ZANE COMES WITH HAIR!!! YES!!!!</p>

<p>The other figures are just meh but the zane is the cherry on the top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set-</p>

<p>It is a very good mech and looks wonderful,and also has knees that bend.</p>

<p>That&#39;s awesome! Hope to see more mechs like this sooner!&nbsp;</p>

<p>But,It can fall apart sometimes,so be careful!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price per part is excellent by the way.</p>

<p>See you!</p>
