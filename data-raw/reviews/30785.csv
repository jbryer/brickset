But I&rsquo;ve read and seen reviews on it and the reception seemed pretty positive, so I thought perhaps the bike wasn&rsquo;t that bad, and decided to give it a shot.</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Jungle Chopper Bike: </b>An&nbsp;aspect of this set I failed to see upon first seeing images, was just how unique and distinct this bike looked compared to other offerings in the Ninjago line or even other action themes like super heroes. It&rsquo;s clear the designer put good effort into the look of this vehicle and I appreciate that. I really like the rugged look the bike is going for and the earth green and sand green color scheme looks fantastic as well. 5 stickers are applied on this build including one for the control panels, and I think the stickers add a lot to the look of the vehicle. The roll bar can lift up to place a minifigure in the cockpit standing up. A large sail cloth piece sits behind the cockpit, and this awesome sail definitely plays a big part in making this bike look unique. The sail is part of a subassembly that includes 2 stud shooters and a spot to place a minifigure, and the play feature here is to remove the subassembly to have a second vehicle entirely and now you could have Nya windsurfing on her own vehicle, it was a nice idea and executed very well. What&rsquo;s even better is that the lack of the sail surprisingly doesn&rsquo;t ruin the appearance of the bike! The final play feature is the built-in suspension for the rear wheel, similarly integrated like in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71700-1/Jungle-Raider"">Jungle Raider</a>&nbsp;, it was well implemented here and it feels like an awesome bonus. If I had to complain about one thing here is the inadequate balance of the bike. Unfortunately, this bike tends to tip over quite easily, and sure, you can balance it just fine when it&rsquo;s not being driven, but if you want to roll it along a surface and eventually let go of the bike to see it roll on its own, it&rsquo;ll pretty much fall immediately, which is just a shame and I think that brings the play value down a bit. Overall, despite my problem with the balance of this vehicle, it&rsquo;s still packed with fun play features and great detail, it&rsquo;s nice to see a fresh take on a staple of action themes and as far as oversized bikes go, this is definitely one of the better ones Lego has put out.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Island Lloyd:</b> This version of Lloyd also appears in<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71746-1/Jungle-Dragon"">&nbsp;Jungle Dragon&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30539-1/Lloyd-s-Quad-Bike"">Lloyd&#39;s Quad Bike,</a>&nbsp;so nothing special in terms of exclusivity, with that said, this is one of my favorite versions of Lloyd to date! His legs feature knee wrappings and a green sash around the hip and the torso has a dark green robe with various awesome details like a belt, some pouches, a tan undershirt and 2 leaves. He also includes a dark gray shoulder armor/single katana sheath with a katana included as an alternate weapon and the ninja half mask in green. Whereas the other ninja of the Island wave feature the same face prints as their movie counterparts, Lloyd has 2 new face prints for this wave, which at this point is very much appreciated, the 2 face prints is a stern/neutral expression and an angry gritted teeth expression, both with the dark tan camouflage stripes which look absolutely fantastic. His hair is also new for this wave, it&rsquo;s a dual molded design with his usual movie hair with a green bandanna and I think it came out fantastic. Finally, his accessory is a golden machete with a golden tassel attached to the end of it. Overall, I love the island aesthetic this figure is going for. The detailing, the new face prints and hair are just fantastic and they all come together to make one of the most unique versions of this character as well as (probably) my favorite.</p>

<p><b>Island Nya: </b>In terms of exclusive figures, Nya is the highlight here, and in my opinion she looks equally as great as island Lloyd. Her legs has printing for a dark azure sash, knee pads and some silver buckles. The torso has more of the dark azure and dark gray color scheme that I really like and the white patterns on the azure part of the torso in particular looks great. Like Lloyd, she has the shoulder pad/single katana holder piece with a katana in the slot. The ninja half mask piece is used here in dark azure and it was a nice and uncommon&nbsp;color to get it in. Her face prints feature the same cheerful and crooked smile expression introduced since 2017, I like these expressions but some variation (especially after 4 years) would be appreciated. Her hair has also been used since 2017, and it looks great as always. Finally, her accessory is a golden twin machete weapon attached to a lightsaber hilt, and this weapon is very reminiscent to Thanos&rsquo; weapon from Endgame, at least to me. Overall, this island suit&nbsp;for Nya is superb.&nbsp;I really loved the pearl dark gray and dark azure color scheme on her and the detailing is generally fantastic, and the fact that she&rsquo;s exclusive just makes me like her more.</p>

<p><b>Rumble Keeper:</b> This figure&rsquo;s prints appears in all sets of the wave, I wish there was some variation but with that said, I liked this figure more than I thought I would. The dark tan armor worn by the keeper looks great and the detailing looks fairly realistic, I also like the hints of dark turquoise on the torso and legs and the the turquoise jewel for the necklace of the figure. Another thing I really like about it is the lavender skin tone for the keepers, it&rsquo;s a color that really catches my attention. One thing I don&rsquo;t like however is that the legs aren&rsquo;t dual molded, so it looks a bit awkward on the side and back of the figure. The head displays a fierce expression, with dark tan teeth and tusks and what appears to be some tattoos of lightning bolts on the front and back of the head. The Rumble Keeper has a dark tan hat for his headgear which is a new color for this wave. Finally, his accessories include a white spear, a colorful shield with great detailing of a white dragon and the fantastic dual molded storm amulet piece which has a golden dragon head surrounded by translucent purple flames. Overall, for a &ldquo;generic bad guy&rdquo; figure, it sure surprised me, the printing and colors are all fantastic and keep this figure interesting, with great accessories to boot. I just wish it had dual molded legs, but no big deal.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set costs R300 in South Africa and I think that&rsquo;s absolutely reasonable. Usually a set of 20 bucks would cost around R350 to R400 here, so I don&rsquo;t know how this set was able to have been priced lower, but I like it, and with a little discount, the set&rsquo;s price could go from good to great.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I enjoyed the bike more than I thought I would! The great details, color scheme and fun play features really make this bike stand out from most other ones which I&rsquo;m really happy about, and other than the balance problem which is the only thing that sucks about this set, I have no other complaints. The figures are fantastic as well with the Rumble Keeper and the phenomenal island variants of Lloyd and Nya, the latter ninja being an exclusive to this set which gives more reason to get it. The value is great as well so I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to recommend this set for Ninjago fans or anyone who&rsquo;s looking for a fun and cheap set.</p>
