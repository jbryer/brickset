<p>You get four figs: Jungle Lloyd, Jungle Zane, PoulErik, and Thunder Keeper.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two islanders share the same torso design, with grass woven armor and lavender skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder Keeper has a brilliant looking mask, while PoulEric has two stacked heads, which is a fun concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Ninja outfits include some new rugged textures, and Lloyd shows off his new hairpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zane also has a little sailboat mini-build, keeping with the Ninja boat designs for the theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s compact but still captures the same essence as the larger catamarans.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the build is that the dragon comes with a angled bend in the middle of its back, giving it an odd bent appearance that makes posing it a bit interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that the legs, which are fairly short and lack elbow joints (per usual), don&rsquo;t have a lot of range of motion; they mostly need to be extended all the way down to keep the dragon&rsquo;s lowered belly off the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not entirely thrilled with the design.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, it gives the dragon a somewhat more canine and playful appearance, but I have not been happy with the posability of the whole thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know the best ways to fix it either; the bend in the body could be on a joint, but the design is built around a rigid structure and adding another joint might be too weak to hold it together during play.&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail design is again loosely connected via technic axles, so it flops back and forth (which again makes it kind of dog-like.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings are also very bare-bones and difficult to pose well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The head makes good use of the new mold elements, and the attachment for the jaw does allow for the tongue to hang out, which just solidified the dog-ness of this dragon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not super impressed with the build, to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, for all that it&rsquo;s lacking, this dragon has&nbsp;<em>character!</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is very expressive, the few poses it can be in makes it look more playful and less intimidating than&nbsp;previous dragons, and the teal and gold color scheme works extremely well.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the end, I have to say that this dragon is indeed worthwhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, lots of teal pieces and some nice figs (including an exclusive Zane) meant that it was a must-buy for me.</p>
