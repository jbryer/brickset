THe chrome parts are ok, but very common in the aquazone sets.  THe magnetic carge case and grabber arm are cool.  Overall, the sets is a great example of a goos aquazone set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-24T04:34:01.207Z","under the sea","being my only aqhashark-set, i am a bit at a loss with this one. it seems that the huge printed canopies should compensate for the rather average overall design. all those printed parts in this set are quite useless for other building projects (unless in an aquashark scenario).
on the other hand those robot arms consist of hinge parts that i didn't see very often, i only remember the arms of the 70's &quot;big figs&quot;. also, because of all the moveable parts, playing with it should be fun. so maybe for kids its not so bad in the end.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-24T20:50:17.153Z","Underwater Hunter","This model is one of the original releases for Aquazone. He was the biggest model for the Aquasharks until the 1996 release of the Aquashark base. It is by far one of the best models ever released. It is like a submarine, shaped like a shark and has arms. Lets start from the front.

The front hatch opens up really wide allowing you to get the mini-fig in and out very easily, not to mention the great paintwork on the fluro orange piece. The shark is controlled by a computer which looks neat. It has spear launchers at the front and mini knives on the side  giving it a good armory. The arms are by far the best, one is a grabbing claw and the other is a magnet for picking up the energy crystal boxes. These arms are so movable they can almost reach any where. Also it has side hooks for the mini-figs flippers when he is not using them. The back compartment is basically a storage bay for the crystal boxes and other bits and pieces. I thought this was excellent for playing with and the vehicle is pushed along by propeller.

The mini-fig is the standard Aquashark, dressed in all black, with a black underwater suit and red mask. His face is the usual with the hair in his eyes making him look very rebel. The model also comes with a gray shark and a red and green sea plant. The energy crystals are awesome and I loved them as a kid as thy added so much to the set, a real goal if you will.

Overall I will say I am a little bias on this model but trying to put that aside I feel it has great playability, the aesthetics are just awesome and a fair few pieces for the price in it's day. This model is a 10/10 as I can not find fault and with the rest of the Aquazone you get endless hours of enjoyment. A must have for any fan, collector or otherwise.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-28T10:55:59.49Z","The definitive Aquashark set","This set is what the Aquasharks were all about, it is sleek and featurese some of the typical Aquazone parts like the arms and harpoons. The rear cockpit doesn't really fit a minifig all the well though, that is my only complaint about this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-07T22:05:39.42Z","looks like a shark","what i like most about this set is that its the most like a shark. the design is awesome with the box being stored in the back. the computer is cool and it shows  a sub on it. the shark and the plant are kinda annoying though. the back is awesome. the part is a unique design and you could probabilly put a prisioner in it. the fiure is good and there are a lot of cool parts. get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-09-07T21:35:13.653Z","It's jaws all over again!","This mid sized &quot;flagship&quot; is from the aquasharks series. The set on its own is fantastic, and in a collection is fantastic! The sub is long and unlike most sets (ship or other) has a windscreen in the front and back, both of which are well designed and decorated, one being black with a mechanical design, and the other is a well decorated shark face. The minifigure is dressed in a cool spaceaged suit, and the helmet was an awesome new item in its time, looking cool with or without the cool red visor. The sub is a long slender machine, and is obviously designed like a shark, with a dorsal AND tail fin. 
The dorsal fin is a little flimsy though and bend after a while... The propellor housing is really sool looking, and is quite sturdy, but can break. The ars are incredibly posable, and in the case of the container, the magnet arm can reach the very back of the ship. The grab jaw is nothing new, but is still in style! The arm system used is efficient, but the members can break easily and when together fall apart when over-used. The set has plenty of good parts, and the harpoons are really cool weapons.
The set tops off with a shark and seaweed for scenery, adding to the playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-06-28T08:49:52.047Z","Great set!","I think this was my first Aquashark set, and it got me to collecting the whole line! I love the sub's arms, one for grasping, the other for lifting the magnetic crate. The chrome crystal is a nice thrown-in as well, the coral is welcome, and the shark, well, he's in it so why not take him? Like all Aquazone sets, I love the minifig divers. So in all, 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Deep Sea Predator submarine was the largest Aquazone set that I owned. (The Aquaraiders sets belonging to my brother until I tok them off his hands.) I'm not sure, but I may have saved up my money for this one myself too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this set, building it was a blast, the two manipulator arms were great fun (even if the pieces unfortunately were easy to break if you happened to play a little too roughly with them.) and I'm always a sucker for pieces that can be picked up by magnetics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This submarine is also fun because it didn't involve any stickers, LEGO gave you a uniquely printed cockpit piece with the grinning visage of a shark, as well as the rear cockpit piece that included some fun printed designs making it look very much like a submarine. With the mechanicle detailing of rivets and things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of a shark, a transparent carrying case for the energy crystal, the energy crystal itself, numerous chromed weapons (torpedoes and daggers.), the flippers and the green and red plants this set just was a sleek, fun set that I enjoyed the bajeebus out of. (Whatever that means.) It can also fit two Mini-Figures, one in the front and the other in the rear. And the printed fin piece on top of the sub truly evokes a fiendish looking creature. This is the kind of submarine you don't want to see off your port bow while fishing in LEGO City Harbour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd definitely recommend this set to everyone who is interested in the Aquazone. I would also recommend it to those who only collect certain sets, because this set is definitive of Aquazone and Aquasharks in particular.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-04-28T14:15:21.463Z","This time, it's personal.","<div>Here we have the Deep Sea Predator, which stands (floats?) in direct opposition to the Crystal Explorer Sub (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6175-1"">6175</a>), the vehicle of choice for those sickeningly noble Aquanauts, who are scouring the deep for crystals for one reason or another. It’s one of those sets that feel large and not large at the same time - it’s got a fairly low piececount and just one Minifig (a wicked-cool Aquashark), but the inclusion of a lot of large specialised pieces makes for a relatively long model with various odds and ends. While the concept is there, I feel that Deep Sea Predator reaches for just a little too much, and the result is a model that has potential but isn’t quite completely there yet.</div><div><br></div><div>I guess that the bulk of my argument stems from retrospect since we’ve since had a number of “underwater” themes and subthemes since the pioneering days of Aquanauts vs Aquasharks, but then, so do we have the benefit of being able to choose from all these sets out there on the resale market. Subsequent iterations of the “aqua” theme have all shown the benefit of having more detailed models at the expense of sheer size; indeed, while it may perhaps be unfair to compare Deep Sea Predator with Sea Scorpion (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6160-1"">6160</a>) which contains three times as many pieces, a closer comparison would be Crystal Detector (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6159-1"">6159</a>), a cleaner, more coherent model that has the same number of pieces. There’s also the possibility that I’m biased in favour of the six-stud wide configuration that dominates much of contemporary City vehicle design, and, as such, the four-wide design here feels a little skinny and claustrophobic.</div><div><br></div><div>But first, let’s understand the basic overview here. The Aquashark Minifig is just plain cool, and his underwater apparatus still looks great even by modern standards. It’s no surprise that he, like the rest of his fellow Aquasharks, is adorned with a shark motif, but what is nice is that the motif matches that of the existing LEGO shark, which definitely promotes aesthetic coherence. And speaking of sharks, one comes with this set as well, which is no surprise either. It is identical to the one appearing in numerous other Pirates sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps the most immediately striking feature of Deep Sea Predator is the bright orange transparent window that serves as the cover for the submarine’s front navigational controls. As was the case with <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Ice%20Planet%202002"">Ice Planet</a>, orange is a polarising choice as a primary theme colour, especially for bad guys; while the Aquanauts certainly feature orange in their builds as well, they fall short of using it as a main colour and it is usually relegated to decorative features only. Still, the shark face window is kind of funny its own way, and no one can accuse it of not being distinctive.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The back of the submarine features a similarly-shaped flip-up mechanism that is ostensibly used for storage, but it’s kind of hard to fit anything in there much larger than the (transparent orange) crystal box that comes with the set. Oddest of all, though, is the claw mechanisms that are attached to the side of the Deep Sea Predator sub. Sure, I get that this is perhaps the primary gimmick of the initial Aquazone rollout, but really - a shark with claws? It just doesn't fly for me.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I wouldn't say that Deep Sea Predator is necessarily a bad set, although I will say that there are better Aqua-type sets out there. Unless nostalgia has a strong grip on you with this particular model, I would recommend investigating the more modern iterations of the underwater LEGO themes.</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
