"Randomness","2023-02-05T21:02:16.21Z","Take a look, it's in a book...","<p>To get this out of the way first, why should you buy this one instead of the other Moments, or even the banners? Well, get it if you want it, are a Ravenclaw (although you could just get the banner), or are collecting these. It&#39;s not really a must-have, but it&#39;s not bad.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This is not a rare Harry Potter. The same face comes&nbsp;in 20 other sets so far, so it&#39;s not important to get, same as the hair which is in 31 other sets so far.&nbsp;The torso comes in the Slytherin and Gryffindor Moments too, so this is still not necessary to get. The legs are also very common.</p>

<p>The character of Cho Chang only comes in three other sets, all of which have been retired much longer than this set, although it could be cheaper just to acquire the CMF Cho than this set off Amazon or something else. Most of this minifigure is exclusive or at least hard to find, and the minifigure itself is really not a bad depiction of Cho, and could be a reason to get this set.</p>

<p>If you have the CMF Flitwick, or the Advent Calendar Flitwick, or even the 2010 Flitwick,&nbsp;you may be entirely confused as to how this is Flitwick, and rightly so. Flitwick looks entirely different in the first movie than in his later appearances, despite&nbsp;being played by the same Warwick Davis. He may have just gotten his life together, I don&#39;t know. Besides, the minifigure looks great, with an exclusive face, torso, and beard piece, which appears in white for the first time. In fact, this piece hasn&#39;t been seen since the Hobbit line back in 2014, when it was used for the dwarves. This minifigure really is superb.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There are twelve stickers in this set, which is a bit much. Five of those stickers are situated inside panels, which makes it even more awkward and hard to make it look nice.</p>

<p>Assuming you aligned the stickers correctly, the final design is not bad. The wall furnishings are very good at making the wall look like a wall&nbsp;and not an inside cover, and the not attached furnishings are good too. The desks and seats are very well-designed to look so but also fit the book, and the bookshelf podium thing for Flitwick is good too. It&#39;s nice to get another treasure chest, and the display case is also very affective, and it&#39;s nice to see the old key piece. This particular color hadn&#39;t been seen since 2015 until it was in the second HP CMF, so it&#39;s great to get it again again.</p>

<p>It very effectively turns into a book, although the actual Lego book element is very hard to get to fit into it, and it would also be nicer if the minifigures could fit as well. The desks and seats make up the top and sides, but they aren&#39;t the most stable, and can very easily be knocked loose.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are not bad parts here, although the only rare parts are used on the non-Harry figures, the sand blue pieces, the parts used to connect the covers, and weirdly the cabinet doors on the inside of the &#39;spine&#39;.</p>

<p>The ppp is 8.5 pieces per dollar, or for the British, 10.24 parts per pound, which is sizeably below the ideal ppp of 10 pieces per dollar. It&#39;s not the greatest buy in that regard.</p>

<p><strong>Playing</strong></p>

<p>It can be played with, certainly. There are a lot of parts to use in a scene, so it ranks pretty well there. It is also a really good display piece, for the same reason. I, for one, like to position it where it looks like Harry tried to do Wingardium Leviosa on a feather (or in this case, a white flame piece), except he raised&nbsp;everything else.</p>

<p><strong><em>El fin</em></strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s not the most quality set. The whole draw of the Hogwarts Moments sets is that they can very easily compact into book shape, sort of in the way of #75952 Newts Case of Magical Creatures, and this set does deliver on that front. But in this compactness, it lacks good value, it lacks&nbsp;nice pieces, and above all, it lacks having something to really make it worth it to buy. I bought it because I wanted a Hogwarts Moment, and figured the Ravenclaw one would be good to get, but besides that reason, I think I&#39;d maybe have been better off getting a different Moment, or just saving my money.</p>

<p>This set is not bad, but it isn&#39;t good. It&#39;s not necessary. You should really get it only if you really want it. If I could, I would give it 3 and a half stars, but I can only do whole stars, so I&#39;ll round up.</p>
