For sure.","<p>The play value of this one is superb and it can also generate huge amount of coins (just put it on, let Mario&nbsp;lay on stomach and then flip him like crazy in all directions, and there are&nbsp;extra coins for spins and flips). The accompanying music is also fun.</p>

<p>Plus, visually it is really appealing and included white platforms are quite rare for now. :)</p>
