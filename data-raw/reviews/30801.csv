Otherwise, one would quickly conclude that this set is drastically overpriced. However....</p>

<p>I purchased this set for my son&#39;s birthday, as he is a huge fan of the Jurassic Park/World series and wants every LEGO JP/W set ever created. We now have 4 versions of the moulded T.Rex, and this green one is by far my favourite. I grew up in an era of scientific inaccuracies, and my brain says that dinosaurs should be green. It&#39;s almost worth the price of admission alone.</p>

<p>But the real star of the show, and the reason why I might have to buy a second copy of this &quot;overpriced&quot; set (or at least turn to Bricklink), are the three printed 2x2 round tiles with the &quot;U.S. Forest Service, Department of the Interior&quot; logos. They are glorious, and they are just what I need to complete some MOCs of old Forest Service vehicles in their unique green liveries. I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve ever seen an official (U.S.) agency logo in a LEGO set before, and this is the one that I would have wished for above any other (as someone who works in conservation and who has spent many months traipsing about our federal forests).</p>

<p>In conclusion, the build &quot;experience&quot; is &quot;meh&quot; and the &quot;volume of stuff&quot; doesn&#39;t seem worth $50, the minifigures are ok (you get Zia, yet another Owen, and a Forest Service employee with a generic uniform), and the subject matter doesn&#39;t break any new ground. I imagine that many people will happily skip this set. BUT. As I&#39;ve mentioned several times, there is just enough awesome here that I&#39;m glad my son owns it, and I&#39;m actually tempted to buy a second copy for myself.</p>

<p>This 4+ set gets a &quot;4&quot; rating, and I&#39;m ok with that.</p>
