It is completely different with the Spring lantern Festival <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/80107-1/Spring-Lantern-Festival"">80107</a>. I fell in love with it at first sight.</p>

<p>Set neatly combines two themes that can be enjoyed - nature, and the aesthetics and mood of Asia. I advise people who are considering buying the set to order as soon as possible, because it is available only in the official store and appears only from time to time. I don&#39;t want to repeat the opinions from the great official&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/article/54963/review-80107-spring-lantern-festival"">review</a>, but I would like to add a few thoughts.</p>

<p>When I started building, my first smile came very quickly when I noticed that a silver metallic grille radiator was used as the sewage grates.&nbsp;The set is really rich in details and in&nbsp;the number of bricks, including unique ones. I noticed this at the beginning when building the pond. It quickly turned out that a dozen or so light green flowers were lost under layers of solid tiles, becoming completely invisible. What a loss! Since I never have too many plants, I quickly started replacing flowers with round plates, which I have plenty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing a dark green colour for the bottom of the pond is a hit, it underlines the illusion of pond depth. Out of curiosity, I tried to use blue or turquoise plates&nbsp;interchangeably under the transparent level of water, but the effect was not so successful. The pond is my favourite fragment from the first 32x32 baseplate.</p>

<p>The smaller 32x16 baseplate is less diverse, but the towering pagoda is outstanding. Built with a very interesting technique, it really pleases the eyes. Unfortunately, I like the rock on which the pagoda stands a bit less. I especially dislike the technic holes in some bricks. I never liked these holes and I always try to hide them. I wonder what was the idea? Did the designer display them intentionally? Are they supposed to imitate burrows? Or is it a place for sticks of dynamite to blow up the pagoda? Ha-ha... I had to do something about it. Burrow, hmm... &nbsp;So I placed a snake in one of them. It may be, but it doesn&#39;t really convince me. I tried to replace the other holes with classic 1x1 grey bricks, but then the rocks looked even flatter and more square. So I left the holes, put the 1/2 technic pins inside and attached various grey bricks, e.g. slope 1x1, which improved the aesthetics of the rock in my opinion.</p>

<p>And so I started my minor modifications, to which this set invites. I added a few more lavender leaves to unfortunately not very successful tree in the corner. I added two additional frogs near the pond. Etc. But most of all I enlarged the whole park with another 16x32 baseplate. I came up with it as a pavement corner, left from the pagoda.&nbsp;The aesthetic white fence was easy to replicate, I extended the alley and, using elements from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70607-1/NINJAGO-City-Chase"">70607</a> Ninjago City Chase set, I added a stall on the pavement close to the park, so that the minifigures had a place to buy their dim sum, coffee or fruits. Later I added a cart with a fish seller, made on the basis of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30537-1/Merchant-Avatar-Jay"">30537</a> Ninjago Merchant Avatar Jay set. And so the fun can go on, and the eastern city can start growing around this remarkable park in the heart of it.</p>

That said, my main gripe with this set is the price. It should&#39;ve been priced at $100 USD. There are a ton of tiny pieces that inflate the piece count; at times during the building process, I wondered why TLG chose to use small pieces when a couple of bigger ones would have sufficed (namely the parts that are not seen). The exterior parts come together really nicely to create an immersive atmosphere. It feels like I am in a peaceful public garden. The modularity of the build is also a nice touch. The tiny pieces do get annoying to properly align!<br />

I love me some good nature scenes, and the spring festival is exactly that!</p>
