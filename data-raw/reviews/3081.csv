Whoever designed this set did a very nice job with the tail.  I really like the claw how you push the little thingy with the arrow forward and the claw opens.  My only slight objection is that it sits too low to the ground, but it doesn't loose a point for that.  To sum it up, this set is spectacular and it is a must have!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Fun to build and incredibly robust and has excellent features like its powerful claw you push open and closed with a switch, unfortunately it's not powerful enough to crush through other lego sets or clamp onto heavy objects without coming off, which can get a bit annoying after a while. The swishing tail is nice and the smooth plates on the subs underside help it slide comfortably along carpet and desk alike!

The real fun in this set (outside of the claw!) comes from detaching the mini-sub components (head + tail and left claw) and taking your new two smaller units for a spin! The gripping claws on one of these are supposed to be used to pick up the included silver crystals but would do better if they were able rotate or were positioned at 90 degrees.

The set has plenty of room to house all three included minifigs and both crystals but nothing else, in such a powerful sub, a computer lab or supply deck would have been a nice addition. Overall though, a fantastic set and recommended in conjunction with more from this theme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-19T10:55:56.067Z","LEGO Aquazone (Stingrays) - Sea Scorpion Review","This is one of the biggest LEGO Aquazone sets which I got. This sub is very sturdy and it has no stickers which you have to worry about. I also like the minifigs which come with this set. The helmets pieces are rare and you can only get them in this theme. The heads of the minifigs are very cool as well with their evil look. I think these faces will be cool faces for some LEGO Star Wars or some other space MOC's and brickfilms. This set also includes two silver crystals. The sub will take you a while but it's a fun built and the whole model is very sturdy.<br><br>I love the fish face on the windscreen in the middle. The windscreen can be opened but there's nothing going on inside the cockpit. The coolest thing is that the cockpit and the jet which you get on the other side can be taken out. The jet has two propellers and two movable arms on each side. The other arm can be opened and closed. It has two knives in it to kill the enemies of the divers. We also get a cockpit on the back which has a cool looking screen. On the back you can also see a propeller which sviwels.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
