"Eep","2021-03-23T04:58:21.547Z","OK but could use some tweaks","<p>I like yet another construction themed set (my first official one after already owning <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4202-1/Mining-Truck"">4202 Mining Truck</a>). I like the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6345794/mini-wheel-barrow-w-%C3%B83-2shaft"">wheelbarrow</a> and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6226594/animal-no-31"">rat</a> is cute but unsure of its relevancy to the set/theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is an easy build but I have some issues with it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Needs clips/grips to hold shovel, road construction sign, and wheelbarrow.</li>
	<li>Orange safety/traffic 2x2 cones (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-14918"">nose cone 2x2x2</a> + <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-3022"">plate 2x2</a>) are way too big; should be <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4518029/nose-cone-small-1x1"">1x1 nose cone</a> + <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4524929/plate-1x1"">1x1 plate</a> as in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75909-1"">75909 McLaren P1</a>.</li>
	<li>Truck bed should be behind cab to not block driver&#39;s view when full.</li>
	<li>Too many 2x4 bricks that remove details like lights (brake/tail, head/front).</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6352696/waggon-bottom-4x10"">Waggon bottom 4x10 (66118)</a> is way too big of a piece that unnecessarily removes details and makes the vehicle look blocky.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For $9.99 retail (I got it for $7.99 at Target), I would like to have more parts to give more details (clips/grips, lights) as described above.</p>
