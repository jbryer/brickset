<p>Photo&#39;s don&#39;t do this set justice.&nbsp; Four stud wide City cars always looked a bit long and high, and too flat on the sides.&nbsp; This car looks beautiful in the metal/plastic.&nbsp; Its long bonnet and short tail, wide stance and deeply sculptured sides look fantastic.&nbsp; There are many really nice details all around this little car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I am being picky, some of the details around the rear of the car are a bit clunky.&nbsp; Also, the car does contain those gaps that some people hate in front of the front wheel arches and behind the rear arches.&nbsp; (The inverted cheese slope with stud still hasn&#39;t been invented!)</p>

<p>The build is very familiar for anyone who has built City cars before, but it still offers and enjoyable build with one instruction book.&nbsp; It is also the perfect challenge for older Lego fans who enjoy trying to build sets without using the instruction book.&nbsp; The car uses the six wide black car base that was introduced last year.&nbsp; Once again it forces a one plate wide black line at the base, although I think that looks fine on this set.&nbsp; The base does allow the drive to sit as low as possible, improving the proportions of the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set contains no stickers.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; And, it looks great without them.&nbsp; It is a triumph of great Lego design over covering things with visually disruptive stickers.</p>

<p>The blond-haired driver is appropriately dressed in a red jacket and open necked shirt.&nbsp; White may not have been the ideal choice for his pants, particularly because the interior of the car is mostly white&nbsp;and so his legs blend in with the interior of the car when he is driving.</p>

<p>For my mind, this is almost the perfect Lego City set.&nbsp; Simple and&nbsp;inexpensive, yet it builds to a great looking set that kids can have fun driving around their other Lego sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Aussielegofan98","2021-01-15T09:42:16.53Z","Best small City set of 2021","<p>Being the first set I&#39;ve purchased for 2021 (and probably one of the few) I am pleased to say that&nbsp;it&#39;s a good one. This sleek looking sports car is a good addition to any city and the colour choice of azure looks great. I am also glad that they included the option of having the roof on or off rather than not including one at all as most City Sets do. Whilst there has been some controversy with the 6-stud wide City vehicles I think it works well and allows extra detail which is good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I definitely would recommend this set for anyone who is into Lego of all ages. Price is ok, but for my friends in Australia and New Zealand do your research as some stores sell it for a lot more than others.&nbsp;</p>

"zorzos","2021-12-29T09:54:26.69Z","I'm liking this so much!","<p>So I got this as a present yesterday and got right to building it as soon as I got home. I&#39;m not aware of when the change in the width of the cars happened that is mentioned in other reviews, but I find this car to be an absolute blast! The build experience was fantastic and did not disappoint at all!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The included minifigure is very nice and a very good addition, considering that the set could very well not include it.</p>

<p>The car is very cool, and I like both the build experience and the finished product. Currently, I have it set up on my desk and I catch myself playing with it or just staring at it which is so awesome! The back side of the car must be my favourite piece with the spoiler and the single taillight design, simply magnificent! I totally recommend this as a small gift or even stocking filler!&nbsp;</p>

"Electron_007","2021-09-05T23:48:12.093Z","Solid and Cheap","<p>This is a nice and simple set with exactly what you would expect for $16. It hasn&#39;t got the best value I&#39;ve ever seen in a city set, but it does what it&#39;s supposed to do.</p>

<p>This set has a sleek looking build and I think it will be a fine addition to any LEGO city, especially if it is integrated with the new road plates. There is ample space for the figure inside and I like the fin featured at the back.</p>

<p>The minifigure is generic and made of existing parts, it would have been preferable to perhaps receive 1 exclusive part to add value to this set.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a pretty average set with a nice design that is one of the more desirable $16 city sets in 2021.</p>

"ARandomLegoFan","2021-01-23T17:42:19.24Z","A standard but good sports car","<p>Part 1. The sports car.</p>

<p>The sports car looks cool and has some nice details. The front looks very sporty with nice part usage for the grill and has a front spoiler. The side has black rims but apart from that it doesn&#39;t have much going on about it. But it looks fine. The rear has an awesome singular brake light and uses a squared off fender piece to cover the twin exhausts. Also the rear has a wing. The interior can of course fit your figure and is coloured white but unfortunately you can see yellow as well.</p>

<p>Part 2. The figure.</p>

<p>The figure is unnamed has white legs a burgundy torso with a print as always a normal face with no second face and light hair.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>

<p>Car looks very sporty indeed, nice part usage and singular brake light.</p>

<p>Cons.</p>

<p>Yellow in the interior.</p>

"Sithbuilder66","2021-03-23T17:43:56.54Z","A surprisingly realistic LEGO city traffic car","<p>This car is absolutely amazing! I love that this is not based off of a real car like speed champions sets, but still look like they could be real vehicles. The minifigure is pretty good I love the combo of the torso and the hair. The color just blew me away, I really love this color of blue and hope to see it more. I also love the contrast of the blue, the white, and the black. In the end, I got this set for my little brother expecting it to not be too realistic, but wow that original opinion changed fast. If you haven&#39;t, go buy this...please it&#39;s worth it.</p>
