I wanted the new camper van, I saw this set was on discount, too, and the rest is history. But what a pleasant surprise this small set turned out to be! And now, I certainly do not want to miss it in my collection.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts used in this set are pretty basic: plates, wheels, windows... the usual stuff for LEGO cars. What was new to me are the turning-action pieces, which do resemble&nbsp;actual axles of a car, completely with suspension and flexibility. The set includes nine stickers, which is nice, since you don&#39;t have to deal with&nbsp;so much fiddly stuff.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes two minifigures, which is a reasonable amount for a small-to-medium-sized set. We have a girl with a leather jacket, brown hair and a two-sided head, one side with a smiling, the other with a laughing face. The other minifgure is a guy with black hair and a racing jacket, who seems to be the main driver of the buggy. The racing team has some gear, including a helmet, a fuel tank, a fire extinguisher, a hammer and a wrench.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A very easy build, manageable for all ages of builders. The axles of the buggy need to be clicked in thoroughly, to grant smooth turning action. The stickers are rather easy applicable, most of them to the buggy, so the whole build can easily be done within 20 minutes time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Upon completion, the set presents us with three different parts: the truck, a trailer and the racing buggy. The truck is a sturdy green-and-white off-road vehicle with a detachable roof and room for both minifigures.<br />
The trailer is a simple flatbed with two small ramps to load up th buggy. It also has room for a gas tank, a fire extinguisher and some tools. It has no standing foot to have it stand on its own detached from the truck.<br />
The buggy has a fresh purple color scheme, large exhaust pipes, a safety rail for the pilot and a big rear spoiler. The turning-action-suspension works smoothly by applying slight pressure from above to the left or right of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As with most recent Lego City sets, the retail price is not very nice, so I only got this one for a good discount at some 14&euro;. And it was worth it! I don&#39;t know if the turning-action mechanism was new or had been used before, but it was a very welcome addition to an otherwise rather basic set. It increases the set&#39;s play value big time and I sincerely hope there&#39;ll be more sets with this feature in the future! Also, the minifigures and tools included make this set very well-rounded and a surefire recommendation for both boys and girls with a fable for all things Lego and especially racing.</p>
