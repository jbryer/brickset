This little Fire Helicopter is a nifty offering from 2021 and the only one I ever saw at retail despite more planned to be released. Again Polybag supplies seem to have been exceedingly limited last year compared to the past. I suspect a large influx of Polybags for North America may show up during 2022. Hopefully.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Adorable looking design with stud-shooter functionality.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Nice newer visor design for LEGO Helmet pieces.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Decent Minifigure offering.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Availability seriously difficult to accurately predict.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Open-Air design makes battling fires tricky for this one-man small craft, smoke inhalation problems and heat issues a genuine thing, should have included breathing tank for Pilot.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is another fun and exciting offering from LEGO City Polybags. A decent showing with some new ideas for building at this scale. A small fleet of these would look great in LEGO City Fire department, with perhaps a few modifications to better equip the pilots for search and rescue missions. Greatly Recommended.</p>
