This polybag definitely seemed perfect for that, as it provides a cheap way to get one of the new minion figures, and the builds seem pretty fun and substantial for a polybag.</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Bob&rsquo;s mini mech:</b> This delightfully strange mini mech doesn&rsquo;t feature too many details, but I like what&rsquo;s included here. I like how 2 phone pieces were integrated into the mech, and the wind up key behind the vehicle is a really nice touch. Bob attaches to the vehicle via 2 jumpers, and 2 control sticks are used to pilot this mech, and even though Bob can&rsquo;t actually hold them with his regular arms, you can position the robo arms to hold the control sticks which is fun to do. Overall, it&rsquo;s a nice wacky build that definitely captures the silly nature of the minions.</p>

<p><b>The Crate:</b> I actually like this build more than the mech as it features some really nice builds and parts. Inside the crate is where you could store Bob&rsquo;s arms when the robo arms are in use and where a trans neon green potion bottle could be found as well. On top of the crate is a fun looking rocket bomb build and a really nice bazooka build that uses a stud shooter. Overall, I like the weapons that accompany this build, and the crate is excellent for storage of accessories included in this set.</p>

<h3>The Minifig</h3>

<p><b>Bob:</b> This was probably the main draw to get this polybag for me, as I wanted to try out at least one minion figure. The new minion body piece is really interesting, it has his black feet that could attach to studs&nbsp;and blue overalls printed on the body with some additional printed detail for the buttons and the pockets. The arms are attached via technic pin connections, so it would allow them to be replaced with the ridiculously long robo arms included here which have 3 points of articulation on each arm, it&rsquo;s great for play and really fun to pose. The minion head piece is appropriately shorter in height and its specific size is used only for this character. It has a great molded goggle design going around the head and the eyes are 1 by 1 round tile prints (one with a brown iris and the other with a green one) that attach to the goggles which works effectively, a little smile is printed just below the eyes as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, his accessories include a banana and a blaster of some sort. Overall, I ended up really liking this figure. Lego did a great job capturing the look of the minions while keeping them Lego-like.</p>

<h3>Value for Money</h3>

<p>I paid R60 for this and I have no complaints with that price. Considering that CMFs now cost R70 in South Africa and I could buy a polybag for less is quite impressive, even the amount of pieces included for the price is fantastic as well.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Even though you may not be a Minions fan, there&rsquo;s a lot to enjoy here. The&nbsp;&nbsp;builds included are fun, you get a cheap way at obtaining one of the relatively new minions, it has fantastic value and it even serves as a great parts pack. So if you&rsquo;re considering trying a Minions set but not really willing to spend too much, this is a great pick and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it.</p>
