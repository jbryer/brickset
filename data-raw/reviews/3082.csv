"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-12T00:00:00Z","","This set and 6135 launched my Aquazone obsession. (And were some of my earlier SYSTEM sets.) You couldn't imagine how much fun a little boy can have with this set and any Aquashark set (unless of course you too were a little boy relatively new to LEGO SYSTEM who discovered SYSTEM sets when DUPLOS grew boring and obsolete.) This was the starter and backbone of my forty something stud long Atlantian Transport-sub. (Which was built two years after purchase of all possible Aquanaut sets, and destroyed one later.) I recommend this set too ANY and ALL LEGO fans! It's GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T23:32:10Z","Mildly juniorised quasi-space set","Out of all the 90's sets, this is probably actually one of the best.  I LOVE yellow and that brings instant appeal to it for me.  The nice grab arms, 2 minifig sections, storage space, Octopus and jewels are excellent bits about this set.  

Disadvantages: Many of the pieces are rather big and unsightly and it's not the best of sets for building alternate models with.  Plus it's still not as good as a spaceship!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-29T22:06:53Z","Great!","This is what made Aquazone awesome! Sure it's not as good as a spaceship but it is really cool. It's not nearly as juniorized as the Alpha Team sets they have nowadays. My only complaint is that the centre hull is tto narrow and overall this ship's inside is too small.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T20:36:26.31Z","Good set.","I love this set! It's design is just pwnage! And with the crystals and octopus it comes with it can really spark one's imagination.

Pros:
Pwnage design
Arms
Cockpit
Motors

Cons:
Pieces that are hard to use in anything other then subs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pythonkid","2005-07-06T12:39:57Z","One of the best aquazone sets..... With a slight modification","This set is one of the best sets in the Aquazone series. I have four of them, and paid only about 6 dollars each. The only problem with this set, is that an aquanaut cannot fit in the back area of this vessel. That can be easily fixed though. All you need is to replace the long 8 stud peice on each side with a two stud peice and a three stud peice leaving the &quot;arm holes&quot; of the cockpit area open. Other than that, this set is great. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-07-20T17:47:52.56Z","A truly great sub!","Two figures,a lot of playability, it has to be either space or aquazone. This sub it infact my favorite, I got it used for $15 off of Bricklink, and I loved it. It is the brother to the other Aquanauts sub, which pales in comparison to this. The sub has a large cockpit, with posable arms, great peices, a storage compartment, and a apot in the back, which serves as a great diving port for the other diver. The aquazone sets tended to include the plants which allow for a great playset. With enough tools to last these two a lifetime, with a few other sets, anyone can have a great time! The old aquazone proved much better than the new aquaraiders (2) that lacks the feel the old aquazone had. This set offers great playability, and can be rebuilt easily. The only con is that the aquazone arm system was too flimsy and broke when not assembled, otherwise the posability is better than the new arms which have a locking mechanism, which, though studying the hinge, also limits the posability, and sometimes is too sturdy and won't move without breaking the connection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Harmonious_Building","2012-02-29T18:51:33.773Z","The Life Aquatic Without Steve Zissou.","<div>1995’s Aquazone represented a brave new world - or it did for me, anyway, since, to my recollection, it was the first time that LEGO attempted a theme outside of the traditional oligarchy of Town, Space, Pirates, and Castle, and the creation of this theme, in turn, resulted in a burgeoning of the myriad of themes that we know and love (or not love) today. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Aquazone began modestly enough, with five sets divided between the (heroic?) Aquanauts and the (villainous?) Aquasharks, whose conflict is never fully explained. Each faction had a flagship underwater vehicle, and Crystal Explorer Sub served precisely that purpose for the Aquanauts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yellow, orange, and blue would not have been my immediate guesses as to the thematic colours for an underwater theme, but I suppose there is something to be said about the distinctive contrast between the yellow and oranges and the deep blue sea where the sub is more likely than not to roam. The submarine - and perhaps Aquazone in general - also filled a sort of spacecraft-like void left behind by the enigmatic <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Spyrius"">Spyrius</a>&nbsp;subtheme that dominated Space that year, which opted for more experimental saucer-like designs and giant robots. I have no doubt whatsoever that this was a calculated move on LEGO’s part, although the sub does place a greater emphasis storage much more than spacecraft in the past. The claws are another very cool component that contribute to the “exploratory” nature of the submarine, although it is doubtless that more than one hapless Aquasharker has ended up in the grip of this machine in the past.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But perhaps the coolest thing about this set is the preponderance of all kinds of unique parts. The octopus, the chrome weapons, the precariously-positioned compass, and the Minifigs themselves were all brand new, although whether or not that justified the absurd price tag is probably a possible point of contention. I will say that the Aquazone Minifigs were probably among the most desirable Minifigs at the time, and LEGO did a really good job of creating detailed suits that fit into the underwater mythos of the whole theme.</div><div><br></div><div>The loosely-related “underwater” theme has since expanded since the original Aquazone days, and I must have developed some kind of psychological hang-up regarding themes of this nature since then since I can’t really think about displaying them without imagining my entire room to be underwater, thereby precluding other sets from being displayed. But that’s my own personal problem; for fans of underwater themes, the original is where its at - provided yellow and orange are not turn offs.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"James83","2022-09-26T15:47:18.167Z","Yellow Submarine","<p>This was Lego&#39;s first large submarine set and was the last large non-Technic set that I brought so it closed my childhood Lego era. With hindsight it is amazing that it took until 1995 before Lego&nbsp;married the sci-fi space elements with&nbsp;the nautical themes (Pirates, Town Harbour etc.) to create an underwater theme. The Aquanauts were much like the Ice Planet people or M-Trons, peaceful folk going about harvesting crystals only to have the Aquasharks (the bad guys - Blacktrons meet pirates) trying to steal their harvest. Personally I always preferred the space and pirate themes. In 1997/98&nbsp;they tried to revamp the Aquazone by rebranding as the Hydronauts and Aquaraiders then changing again in 1999 with the Stingrays as the baddies. This was a mistake. With only 4-5 sets each for the original Aquanauts and Aquasharks arguably there wasn&#39;t enough critical mass to make this theme as successful as it should have been. Having three groups of baddies within 4 years feels muddled and you could never build up a coherent collection of any one group unlike the space and pirate ranges.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The Crystal Explorer submarine was impressive. Being a huge fan of ships and submarine I just had to have this when it came out in 1996. It looked cool and sci-fi and the yellow and black colour scheme with dark blue transparencies was a perfect combination. Many of the bricks were unique (to me at least) for the time and the parts count was large. Construction was not complicated but&nbsp;was sufficently involving to enjoy putting it together. The&nbsp;submarine contained three compartments.</p>

<p>The bow section was the cockpit/bridge, a complete hemispherical transparent covering was rare at this time and was a very neat feature. The upper half hinged open to allow access and was itself attached to a hinged roof panel which allowed you to further open the entire cockpit. A&nbsp;minifig could stand inside the front section. The controls included a&nbsp;2x2 sloped printed&nbsp;computer brick (with a vent brick on top) and two steering wheels to the rear which served as ballast controls. The rear of the cabin had a wraparound sloped windscreen brick and the hinged roof mentioned above, which had two 1-stud printed 4-button computer pad bricks and was topped by a fin holding the compass. The major letdown was that this rear cabin section was only 2 studs wide, it was almost impossible to get a minifig to stand in this area, especially an Aquanaut one wearing the diving gear. So the rear of the cockpit looked cool but was useless and had no other internal features.</p>

<p>The cabin was flanked by two flexible manipulator arms, the left-hand arm having a grab and the right-hand arm having a magnet to pick up the yellow storage box (concept lifted from M-Tron). These are were quite sturdy. The yellow and black colour scheme was repeated in the arm sections.</p>

<p>Aft of the cockpit/cabin was the cargo bay in which to store the crystals. It was large and was accessed by two folding panels with printed Aquanuat logos. Externally there were clip bricks for two harpoons on which the second diver&#39;s flippers could be stored. On top was a&nbsp;1x2 slope printed computer brick, two yellow antenna and a 2342 utensil brick often used in older Space sets. The cargo bay could be reached by the flexible arms without any problems.</p>

<p>In the stern was the second cockpit with its own hinged sloped windscreen from the Space sets alongside&nbsp;the angled one-piece cockpit base brick that often accompanied it. This&nbsp;would usually allow a minifig to sit inside easily but on this set a 1x6 brick was added on top to build up the structure&nbsp;which prevented the minifig&#39;s arms from fitting easily. No other equipment or detailing was added to the cockpit, this felt odd given that a computer had been fitted outside of the submarine!&nbsp;Two fins either side carried the propellers with their distinctive yellow shrouds unique to the Aquazone sets and two more antennas. At the rear of the cockpit was a third propeller.</p>

<p>The base of the set rested on two tubular skids made up of 2x2 octagonal pillar bricks which clipped fairly securely to the base and allowed smooth carpet sailing. Generally the set was sturdy but it was quite heavy to lift.</p>

<p><b>The Minifigures</b></p>

<p>Two minifigs were included; Aquanaut 1 and Aquanaut 3 - the latter being exclusive to this set. Both had printed torsos, different heads (AQ3 having a microphone face borrowed from the Space Police range) and had diving backpacks and helmets, Aquanaut 1 having a blue visor and Aquanaut 3 having a black one. Only one pair of flippers was included as were two harpoons and two knives. While pirate sets always had sharks, Aquazone sets had an octopus, one being included with this set. Two crystals and a 2-peice plant/coral were also included.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I must admit to some disappointment with this set. It&nbsp;looked attractive with fins and angled sections making it look the part. But like some of the Space vehicles&nbsp;the looks are deceiving and when you look closer its clear less attention was paid to the actual vehicle. The rear of the cockpit was accesible via the roof but could not hold the second minifig and equipment dropped inside was impossible to reach by hand (panel bricks might have worked better here) and the stern cockpit was also difficult to access with a minifig to get him seated and lacked any controls or detailing. Thankfully the cargo bay worked well. I did try some upgrades using Space parts but eventually I broke this up for my own submarine projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But having said this, I did enjoy playing with this set and there was fun to be had if you overlooked the snags or did your best to overcome them yourself. And that really is the secret of Lego. You can adapt it and get enjoyment from it the best way you can and who can ask any more than that?</p>

"Heliatck","2018-12-09T21:24:15.487Z","100% underwater loveliness","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Aquazone is one of the more memorable themes of the 90&#39;s. With it&#39;s instantly recognizable blue and yellow color scheme with transparent orange highlights, the models from the &quot;good guys&quot; (i.e. the Aquanauts) are some of the most attractive among all the amazing stuff that was coming out back in the golden age. It should be noted that there is also a counterpart &quot;bad guys&quot; subtheme: the Aquasharks, which in my opinion are a little less memorable.</p>

<p>There are some very interesting things about the Aquazone theme. First, it was conceived as a derivative of the space sets that were coming out at the time. There are prototype pictures available online which clearly show this. It is also obvious from the designs that they take some hints from space. The use of lots of big transparent pieces, antennas and engines is a clear link. Even the minifigures kind of look like space men.</p>

<p>Second the theme uses some interesting parts. This is a theme which uses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>very few parts</li>
	<li>very big parts</li>
	<li>very unique parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Now all of these are points which some people would consider a negative in most cases. However, I think the Aquanauts in particular manage to pull off what most other themes can not in this regard. Even though there are very little parts per set, you still feel like you&#39;re getting your money&#39;s worth. That&#39;s mostly because of point number two: the parts are quite big. There are a lot of unique parts used throughout these sets as well. From the flexible arm pieces, to the hexagonal parts and the chrome pieces, these are all parts which make this theme special.</p>

<h2>Crystal Explorer</h2>

<p>Focusing on the set at hand, I think Crystal Explorer is one of the best looking models available in the Aquanauts lineup. If you really want to get in to this theme I would suggest picking up all of the sets, since there&#39;s only six and they aren&#39;t that expensive. But if you have limited space or only want to spend a small amount I would get either this one or the Crystal Crawler (6145).</p>

<p>Now, like I said all of these are surprisingly pretty inexpensive sets. At the time of writing you can pick up the Crystal Explorer for around 20-30&euro;. If you don&#39;t want the box you could probably even get it for less. For that kind of money, I feel like you are getting a really nice set. It has all the key Aquazone features and comes with a few very nice parts.</p>

<p>The model itself is built up on a single large 6x16 plate. It is quite a lot bigger than you would expect from the picture. The size is ideal for swooshing and the build is sturdy enough to handle with one hand. There are some cool decorative elements used around the model such as printed pieces and chrome pieces. It is not perfect: the antennas will break of easily and the windshields are a bit difficult to close sometimes because they are so big.</p>

<p>There are a few nice play features such as the grabber arm and the magnet arm on the sides. There is a working compass included on the top and the section in the middle functions as a cargo bay for storing loot (crystals!).</p>

<p>Making your own Aquazone mocs with these pieces is certainly possible and people have made some really cool ones (including a monorail!), but you would need to get creative if you wanted to use all of the parts in a completely different theme. So in that sense, the uniqueness of the Aquazone sets makes the parts a little difficult to use for other things. There is a lot of yellow, which is arguably not a very useful color for generic builds. The windshields and antennas would be useful for space builds, but not much else.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you could get only a single Aquanauts set, I would pick this one. It offers great value for money and looks great on display. A fun set to play with as well, though not for smaller children. The pieces are very nice and unique, but this makes them a little hard to use for other builds.</p>
