It has very little parts, near-to-no functions and the price of around 25&euro; is way too much. I got it for 22&euro;, which is on the verge of being OK, because I simply wasn&#39;t patient enough to wait for it to drop below 20&euro;. It is obviously nothing much to display, but for the younger builders, it can be some fun, at least temporarily.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While this set did have some all-new parts, at least to me, they are not so much special. The most interesting ones are the two &quot;water-shooters&quot; for sure. They spring-loaded, just like the ones used so often for blasters in the Star Wars series, just a little bigger (2x4 bricks). The &quot;water&quot; parts look a little awkward, more like ice, as my younger daughter pointed out very eloquently.&nbsp;<br />
More new parts are the &ldquo;fires&rdquo;, which consist of a single piece of plastic that can stand on its own or can be attached to another LEGO piece. They can also be stacked onto each other to create a larger &quot;fire&quot;. To me, the translucent green bricks in the small &quot;lab-building&quot; were also new, at least in that colour.<br />
The rest is more or less basic parts for a helicopter.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures accompany this set, which is a nice amount for a rather small-to-medium-sized set. We have one female helicopter pilot with a smirk on her face, a male worker with a hardhat and a firefighter on a bike. This last guy seems to be called &ldquo;Clemmons&rdquo;&nbsp;and appears in a LEGO TV series. There is also some gear: A radio and a wrench for the worker, a small fire extinguisher for Clemmons and a stretcher for him and the pilot.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy as it can be: first the bike, followed by the structure and the helicopter. All is build from bottom to to top and can easily be done within 20 minutes.<br />
There seems to have been a change in the design of the instruction booklets: They now only have a blank space as background for the parts of the set that are shown in the particular booklet. In the last booklets of the City theme, there was some kind of town scenario in the background...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished set consists&nbsp;of three parts, obviously: the bike, the helicopter and the small laboratory-like structure. The bike is the well-known speedbike from the city series with a blue light and a holder for a fire extinguisher in the back.&nbsp;<br />
The structure has some trans-green blocks, control panels and holders for some tools. To one side is a ladder to gain access to the satellite dish on top of the &quot;roof&quot;. The fire-parts can be placed individually on this structure, some loosely, some attached via one knob.<br />
The helicopter itself is quite standard: the long nose-part, turbines and a two-bladed rotor. Mounted to each&nbsp;side are the two water-shooters and in the back of the main body is a small hatch to load the stretcher.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s really not much to say about this set, which clearly shows, how basic it is. I liked the new fire parts, which give you the option of creating larger fires than before. If only these parts would have had a slightly more realistic design... The water-shooters and the neon green blocks also appealed to me, as did the number of minifigures (three).&nbsp;<br />
On the other hand, the cheap design of the helicopter and the &ldquo;building&rdquo; clearly showed, how little effort the designers put into this set, if any. The retail price of 25-30&euro; is a cruel joke for a non-branded set with only little more than 200 pieces. Is it because of the minifigures that recent city sets are so expensive? I don&#39;t get it. I just got myself the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76896-1/Nissan-GT-R-NISMO"">Speed Champions Nissan Nismo</a>, which came at a discount for 14&euro; and this set has almost 300 pieces! Now that&#39;s a nice price-to-piece ratio!<br />
So this is another one of these sets, where I finish my review with the statement: If you&#39;re a crack for helicopter, like me, go get it (at a reasonable price). If not, you should definitely save your money.</p>

"Stormgaming21","2022-01-10T20:41:04.717Z","Review of 60281-1: Fire Rescue Helicopter: A Fun for Kids Set but has Some Baffling Design Decisions","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO has been producing Fire sets for decades now, likewise they have also continuously produced helicopters either as solo sets or as a part of a bigger set &amp; fire helicopters are very frequent &amp; seeing that 2021 gave us three different helicopters in different sets, price ranges &amp; scales means that the biggest needs to make itself standout in some way, but did it? Read on to find out.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">First off, the build process. Bag 1 is side builds including a small fire motorcycle, nothing really worth mentioning here, &amp; a structure build of some variety &amp; description, I will further on this later. Bags 2 &amp; 3 are the helicopter itself &amp; again there is really nothing to special to mention here, all bare bones &amp; simplistic but that may not always be a bad thing as after all this is made with kids in mind though I feel that it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that there are some small fiddly bits to be careful of if you&rsquo;re younger, these include the small Technic assemblies on the back of the intakes, which are rather loosely secured &amp; one on mine is exceedingly loose but tolerances may vary, &amp; the small wheels can always be a hassle but the tires are pre-attached so that&rsquo;s nice. You also need to attach the windowpanes to the housing, but you only must do it four times plus the windscreen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The structure build uses very standard colours in black, white, grey &amp; yellow for the beams, meanwhile the fire bike &amp; helicopter use red, grey &amp; cool yellow, a nicer shade of yellow than the harsh vibrant yellow on 2022 sets. The stickers are used on the sides of the motorcycle, something that is never consistent is LEGO&rsquo;s choice on whether to sticker or print motorcycles, pick one or the other, the rest of the stickers are used on the helicopter one on each side of the canopy piece, one on the side of the shooters &amp; one on each side of the tailfin, another inconsistency from set to set. Two prints are used for consoles, one on the structure build, the other in the helicopter cockpit. A minor weird detail is how the control sticks are behind the figure so they have to reach back to control the craft which seems really painful.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For play features you get spinning propellers &amp; two large water cannons mounted to the sides of the helicopter which I can safely say would not be aerodynamic in any way, shape or form but are good for playability seeing as you get five large fire pieces which you can shoot with the water cannons to recreate what the box says in large font on the bottom left corners &amp; since they aren&rsquo;t attached to the structure with studs, they are easy to knock off, you can also medivac the worker by putting him on the gurney in the back of the helicopter but they don&rsquo;t have any medical equipment, so I guess they hope and pray till he gets to hospital.</p>

<p>Now on to the side builds &amp; first up is the fire motorcycle which is more or less just the standard fair for a small motorcycle like this, but it does use the more recent stud-based connection over the older-style bar connection, attached to it are a siren &amp; a small two-piece fire extinguisher which feels paltry compared to the two massive water cannons on the helicopter.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Now I have to talk about the structure build, which is a thing but what, I don&rsquo;t know, the satellite dish says communication, but the clear green says nuclear powerplant, all I know is that it&rsquo;s flammable &amp; fire is dangerous. The structure build is also designed with expansion in mind as each side on the base has a 1x2 brick with Technic pinhole for easy build-up that can be done with other from the 2021 Fire sets. Attached to the back of the clear green block is a pair of minifig accessories, a wrench &amp; walkie-talkie, nothing notable just some standard accessories to use</p>

<p>For minifigures you get three, two of which are unnamed characters &amp; the other is a named character from the &lsquo;LEGO City Adventures&rsquo; cartoon. We&rsquo;ll start by talking about Clemmons, the named character in the set &amp; to be honest, he&rsquo;s just a motorcycle firefighter with a unique head &amp; a name, although generic, the printing for the figure is as nice as ever &amp; the head is rather nice as well with printed sideburns but he does only have one face sadly which is always a shame on any figure but more so on a named figure who could really have done with an alternate face as he just has a generic expression.</p>

<p>Next is the helicopter pilot who uses the new visor piece that was introduced for Sky Police in 2019, nice to see that they still are using it, the head used for the pilot is another single-faced head but this one has some real emotion showing a high level of confidence, some may even say cockiness, &amp; also seen with an earpiece for communication either with base and/or Clemmons but could also be with the worker.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Finally, is the worker, who isn&rsquo;t all that interesting, but honestly do we need anything more than just a worker? He is wearing a red hard hat &amp; a hi-vis jacket with blue undershirt &amp; dark blue trousers &amp; even this generic worker has a more expressive face then Clemmons with a look of nervousness &amp; beads of sweat rolling down his forehead or he could be sweating because of the fires breaking out.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an interesting set to be sure with some good, some not so good &amp; some rather strange design choices but at the end of the day what you get is simply a fun set for a kid with easy to set up play features combined with a straightforward build process which any kid can follow to get to playtime &amp; at a price of &pound;25 you could do worse but if it&rsquo;s the build process you&rsquo;re after, then look elsewhere.</p>
