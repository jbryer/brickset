"Paperdaisy","2020-12-28T17:40:28.607Z","Basic camper van","<p>This is the first LEGO camper van I have built or owned, but it is one of many that have been made. Having looked back at some of the older examples, altogether I don&#39;t think this is an improvement.</p>

<p>I do think it looks the part, as much as I can tell given that I don&#39;t know a lot about camping. In a city layout using 6 wide vehicles, I think this would be a nice display piece. Having said that, there is an unsightly gap at the back of the roof which allows you to see in to the sleeping area.</p>

<p>The interior is where I think it hasn&#39;t gone so well. The floor of both the driver&#39;s area and the main living area have multiple levels with gaps around the wheel arches, and not for an obvious reason that I can see. This makes it feel like there is wasted space.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way into the main cabin for the minifigs except climbing over the driver&#39;s seat (not exactly great with a baby, I imagine) unless you consider the hinged side to be a door for figures rather than access for humans.&nbsp; There&#39;s also no suggestion of how the sleeping area would be accessed either, though size limitations could make this difficult. I do like the baby&#39;s bed but of course only one adult will fit in the bed up there.</p>

<p>The back of the roof feels like they ran out of parts and just put a big plate on- there&#39;s actually some space under there but it&#39;s not really useable as it is. With a few more parts maybe a bigger sleeping area could have been made, or some other camping accessories could have been included.</p>

<p>Purely for playing make believe camping, with a bigger budget the Creator 3 in 1 set 31108 would be more fun, with more space to play in, but it does sacrifice realistic scale to achieve that. For a comparable City vehicle, 60182 looks like it is much more coherent albeit at a slightly higher price point.</p>

"Sobel","2021-03-14T12:37:25.937Z","A huge step backwards from the last camper van I bought...","<p>Besides helicopters, my second objective in LEGO City sets are camping vans, trailers and everything camping-related. So of course, I had my eyes on this set since it was announced. It looked quite similar to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60057-1/Camper-Van"">2014 Camper Van</a>. But, as I had to find out during the build, only little effort was put in the design of this set...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard vehicle parts, windows, plates, tires, and some interior like seats, a table and a little gear. Nothing fancy. Also, only a few stickers, which is OK on one hand, but a flaw on the other, as I&#39;ll point out later.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three minifigures included in this set: A &quot;father figure&quot; (yes, that&#39;s the official description), a mom and a baby. The dad has pointy hair and a vest printed on his torso, the mom has long hair, a two-sided head and, what was really cool to me, a baby carrier! The baby fits nicely in there and that was one of the reasons, I wanted this set in the first place. Furthermore, there is some gear, like a (green?) camera, a camping cooker, a baby bottle and some food.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>One of the most simple builds I ever experienced. Might be a good training for young builders who want to build their first set on their own. Start at the bottom, finish at the top. 15 minutes and you&#39;re done.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Holiday Camper Van comes out as an almost rectangular box-like vehicle. The whole roof can be detached to gain easy access to the interior. The alcove can be opened and reveals some sort of bed or a storage place for the gear.<br />
The right side of the camper can also be opened to reveal two seats in the back, a small table and a coffee machine. The cockpit has a single seat for the driver, some (printed) instruments, a steering wheel and a space for a coffee mug. There are a lot of dark-tinted windows all around the van and the tan-and-blue stripes to the side give it an extravagant look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Yeah, no. This set once again clearly shows what&#39;s wrong with LEGO these days. The company focuses on their merchandise products like Star Wars, Minecraft and Ninjago. The whole City series gets neglected badly. As mentioned in the introduction, this set can be compared to the similar one from 2014. And in this comparison, the 2021 set SUCKS.&nbsp;<br />
Unfinished looks, open spaces, where there should not be some (backside of the alcove, wheelhouses...), absolutely cheap design of the interior with large gaps and narrow spaces in the back and, for once, a few more stickers would have been a good addition, especially on th inside. The 2014 set for example has a TV-sticker on one inside wall, if I recall right. A simple, but welcome addition! But nooo....<br />
So be advised, and don&#39;t support these cheesy sets, which come at a far too high price and show the little effort, some LEGO designers obviously put in their work.</p>

"maniac4bricks","2022-01-15T06:29:10.813Z","Better off with a Predecessor...Less than a basic Camper set.","<p>To start things off, I&#39;ve been a fan of LEGO camping sets for years, so I have experience building not only this one but other previous ones and various styles.<br />
<br />
I would like to compare this camper van set to 31079 Sunshine Surfer Van from 2018, 60057 Camper Van from 2014 and 7639 Camper from 2009. These I have built at least twice and have various designs and features that are comparable to 60283 Holiday Camper.<br />
<br />
In terms of construction, this set is almost EXACTLY built like 60057 Camper Van, with subtle changes such as the front bumper, window placement, different plates used for the roof, and the placement of the chair inside from left side to center. The side opening is from the opposite side of the van. In terms of accessories, there are less than the former: no canoe, no oars, no life jackets. The bed is in the roof instead of the van interior. To be fair the older version had space in the roof as well, but back then it provided spaces for both minifigures instead of just one. Speaking of the roof, the 2014 camper also offered an opening hatch for the oars and jackets for the canoe in its backside. The 2021 version? No such opening for any use. Just a small cradle of panels by the bed. The one benefit of the newer version, is that there are two seats for the table instead of one, as well as a kitchenette in the back of the camper. But in my opinion, it sacrifices a lot of play value while bearing a simpler layout. I can&#39;t say that it&#39;s easier for interior play, as both models equally have removable roofs. Not to mention they are the same retail price, but now with less pieces available. The only other benefit in terms of accessories is a baby, cooking kit and food, which takes some adjustment to pack into the van comfortably.<br />
<br />
Now let&#39;s see how 60283 compares to 31079 Sunshine Surfer Van. While drastically different in design, the features are once again compromised in the 2021 set. Sunshine Surfer Van allowed 2 seats for minifigures in front, fold-out table to eat, bed in the back (which unfolds for storage space), a larger kitchenette closer to the front seats, and an open-faced roof to store 2 folding chairs, table, grill, umbrella, and surf board. I understand this is a 370-piece set (at a larger price as well), with 2 studs extra width and some extra depth, but some of these could have been included in the 2021 set, despite being a few years newer and for woodlands camping compared to beach outing.<br />
<br />
Finally we go back to 2009 with the 7639 Camper, which was primarily built on a large vehicle base, less advance building techniques and a smaller parts count (165 and sold for $16.99). Despite the Camper being a shorter, stouter model, it can still open up, even fuller than other later camper vans, from both sides. This provides full access to fitting minifigures in the seats, access to all accessories, and (as advertised), the ability to fit two minifigures for sleeping cabins on the floor and in the roof. The 2021 Holiday Camper Van also encourages removing the chairs and tables from the interior to use outdoors, as well as the kitchenette, so technically bedding for both minifigures is an option still. However, despite its limitations, there are still more accessories available for outdoors use in the &#39;09 Camper, which is also designed for the Winnebago-like camping experience, but also can adapt to the beach with its surfboard. The pros of the modern camper is in the interior design (especially the window between front and back seats), the build of the cooking gear is improved, and the eating area is slightly bigger by a row of studs, for each patron&#39;s food.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d also like to mention that this camper also includes a toe hitch on its rear bumper, unlike any of the others I compared it to. However, in the year in which this set was available for sale, no other sets have been encouraged to adapt to that hitch. Perhaps there are options but nothing directly from the instructions at launch. Personally I think it has potential to connect to several trailers, maybe even ones from other camper sets like 31052 Vacation Getaways (2016) for the boat trailer, 31108 Caravan Family Holiday (2020) despite the trailer being nearly the size of the Camper, 3184 Adventure Camper (2012) for bicycles and surfboards, 4435 Car and Caravan (2012) but by that point it&#39;s repeating the features of the Camper, or 60117 Van &amp; Caravan (2016) which also would double up the eating, kitchenette and bedding options of the camper. If there is a set from 2021 made compatible with this camper via the toe hitch, I would love to know.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, this set does nothing new for the camper style vehicles, nor the features that would accommodate the camping. If anything, it&#39;s a step backwards in many areas. Sure it worked in a similar parameter as the 2014 version, and even changed the interior, but chose to offer less play value even with removable objects. Especially consider the fact that there are very few camping themed sets released around the same time, so unless you had extra parts or a previous campground, this set will drive up to the area underprepared. A formidable model for kids, especially without access to previous ones, but nothing exciting for longer-time fans of City unless you wanted a colour swap and shorter hatches. If you did pick this up, I would recommend skimming the online instructions of the 2012 and other camper sets for ways to spice up the interior and packing capabilities of the van, because it has the potential for more than it offers.</p>

"VictorJiangKiangLiangMiang","2022-06-11T03:45:02.79Z","Holiday Camper Van Review- A Disappointing Step Backward","<p><strong>Holiday Camper Van (2021) Review</strong></p>

<p>The City theme usually has relentless waves of police or fire sets, so civilian vehicles are markedly more appealing to me. I have a predilection for&nbsp;various caravan sets, from the smaller 60117 (City) and 31079 (Creator) to the larger, excellent sets of 31052 (Creator) and 10279 (Creator Expert). I, therefore, purchased 60283 a while ago, but unfortunately, it was a disappointment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts and Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>City sets typically have relatively attractive, though unspectacular Minifigures, and straightforward techniques with common parts and tons of stickers. Of interest would be the baby in Bright Bluish Green, as well as the Sand Yellow and Medium Lilac printing for the figures.&nbsp;Similarly, the sand yellow carrying accessory is also functional and decent. Otherwise, the set comprises 190 parts that are relatively common.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>City sets are relatively simple in their builds, catering to a younger audience. As expected, 60283 is simple, merely requiring 20 minutes to complete. This process is thoughtfully designed into two bags, one for the base and&nbsp;interior details, while the other completes the van, inducing ease of construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exterior, notwithstanding the&nbsp;blocky design, is broadly attractive, with the clean white colour&nbsp;scheme accompanied by the brick yellow base. The exterior stickers are vexatious to me but are a minor issue, and the&nbsp;studded roof is functional but unspectacular and could be&nbsp;easily detached. Playability is guaranteed as one side slides open, which resembles the&nbsp;designs observed in past sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the interior is mediocre in realism at best. Merely four studs wide, the van possesses&nbsp;two blue chairs, along with a minuscule, unattractive table. The diminutive size of the caravan only&nbsp;accommodates a rudimentary kitchenette additionally, with a&nbsp;coffee/tea maker, bottle and biscuit, but no sinks or&nbsp;refrigerators; however, considering the set&#39;s price, it is acceptable.&nbsp;Therefore, interior room is especially restrained, lacking sufficient room to pose Minifigures elsewhere, with the layout only permitting exceedingly narrow space to walk. Such is further worsened by the interior base having uneven heights between the chair and kitchenette and the&nbsp;unsightly white studs next to the chairs, which the designer could have tiled these studs utilising merely two more pieces. Moreover, the difference in colours&nbsp;for the studs at the base is an additional aspect that could be improved simply upon, in my opinion.&nbsp;The front driving seat is unfurnished, merely studs that look unfinished, as decorating&nbsp;it using several tiles would be straightforward, and I had done some MOCs to my model, but this incompleteness is mediocre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accessibility tends to be a persistent issue for City sets through the lack of doors or staircases. 60283 offers the idea of&nbsp;an exterior door, and although it is difficult for the Minifigures to get in through this way, I appreciate the designer&#39;s attempt to suggest a way to access the caravan.&nbsp;However, there are numerous further problems. It is challenging for Minifigures to access the back in normal means.&nbsp;I also disapprove of the designer&#39;s decision to shift the bed to the top of the van compared to the previous models. While potentially a laudable goal, it induces in Minifigures being impossible to access the top floor, which is too significantly insufficient in size, being impossible to place two Minifigures within it. The roof also appears to have a relatively minor but noticeable gap, adding another design flaw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contrasting to the previous sets offered by City and Creator, 60283 offers little of improvements or refinements from preceding successful models. Based on Brickset stats, 60283 has similar pricing with 60117, but the latter is superior to me, as it offers an additional van. The&nbsp;former set has some aspects that lack in unrealism, including a much smaller dining space, but the bed could be accessed, and the overall design is considerably more spacious.&nbsp;The Creator set 31079 is ultimately more expensive (by 10 US dollars), but is an exceptional, realistic set to me,&nbsp;including an outstanding, well-crafted&nbsp;cabin design with a folding table, a realistic kitchenette, and well-designed furniture, including a television, chair and bed.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>Nowadays,&nbsp;most City sets are relatively overpriced, as reflected by the 2021 and 2022 waves, both considering a price per piece of price to volume. This set is&nbsp;of inferior value&nbsp;to the previous models, as this set has a price per piece of 10.5c compared to 8.0c and 9.2c for the other two models. Still, it is of adequate&nbsp;value that is certainly better than most City sets and comparable in contrast to the other vehicle sets. Considering the price to volume value, the set is also laudable from my perspective, as in comparison to recent City sets, it is moderately priced.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Despite 60283&#39;s tolerable&nbsp;value, the realism of the build is an atrocious step backward,&nbsp;complemented with a rudimentary exterior design. The Minifigures and parts also could not elevate the set above mediocrity for me; hence I would recommend the vehicles 60253 or 60287 ahead of this set.</p>

"HomeOnTheRange","2022-12-19T02:46:06.82Z","Wonderful little camper fun!","<p>I bought this for our children who do not seek&nbsp;realism in the builds and have never been in a camper van before.&nbsp; For $15 on sale, it seemed like quite a good deal given all the cool features.&nbsp; My 3-year-old put it together following the instructions with only intermittent intervention from me (and I put on the stickers).&nbsp; Bravo to the graphic designers who made the instructions so well that a young child can put it together.</p>

<p>Both my child and I really enjoyed the side of the camper swinging open to reveal a small interior where they can enjoy a snack. This play feature really impressed my child and I thought it was rather cleverly done as it stays closed while the van is driving but is also easily opened without any complicated mechanisms (aka easy for child to do).&nbsp;The tiny counter in the back has a drink can and a small one cup coffee or tea maker with mug.&nbsp; The grey lid on the drink can even has tiny art to show the tab etc.&nbsp; The set comes with multiple one-brick-wide round tile food items including pink strawberries and a brown donut.&nbsp; The cutest foods are the two little sunny side up eggs and a croissant!&nbsp; Yum... This food can be stored in the back compartment on the top.&nbsp; If the front part of the top (over where the bed and crib are) is off, it is fairly trivial to take off the back roof to store these less than one brick high extra pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The people are really cute. The main reason I bought this set is that it was an inexpensive option for&nbsp;getting Lego baby with a front-wearing baby carrier (like a brown Baby Bjorn) that either parent can wear. My 3-year-old&nbsp;really enjoys pretending one of his toys is the mommy comforting another toy who is the baby.&nbsp; The baby also has a crib at the top.&nbsp; Thus, two people (one adult, one baby) can sleep in the top compartment.&nbsp; There is also a baby bottle the parents can hold and cute little camera for taking pictures of their first outing.&nbsp; I also liked the little camp stove which is simple but effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were two challenging bits to the build for us.&nbsp; One, the clear, colourless one-brick-high cylinder (for one of the cans/jars) I thought was missing, but was actually hiding in plain sight in the plastic bag.&nbsp; Because it is small, clear and colourless, it took a bit of searching to find.&nbsp; If you are reading this before opening your set, look for this piece when you are dumping out the pieces and save the bags until you are done building to be safe.&nbsp; The second issue was that we currently only have one side mirror because one of the pieces that hooks onto the side of the camper was malformed/warped/melted(?).&nbsp; At first, I didn&#39;t even realise it was a Lego piece in the set until I realised the second was missing and then compared to the two.&nbsp; I went on the Lego website and requested a replacement.&nbsp; Fortunately, it didn&#39;t prevent otherwise finishing the build.&nbsp; Now our 3-year-old is happy playing with the set.&nbsp; He doesn&#39;t really care about the side mirror, or if he needs to take the roof of to put the characters to bed.&nbsp;</p>
