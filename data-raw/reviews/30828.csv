<p>In this review I will be reviewing Lego City set 60291 the Family house. It has 388 pieces and is recommended for ages 5+.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Minifigs</strong></h2>

<p>There are four minifigs in this set, and they are the Mom, the Dad, and two kids, a boy and a girl.</p>

<h3>The Mom</h3>

<p>The Mom has black waxy hair, a head that has&nbsp;a smiling expression on the front, and on the back it has a smiling face with the eyes closed. Her body has some buttons, a pink vest, and a&nbsp;necklace. She has plain dark blue legs.</p>

<h3>The Dad</h3>

<p>The Dad has a dark blue hat, and a smiling expression with a black beard for his head. He has a light bluish gray hoodie jacket with a dark red vest. He has plain dark tan legs. He also has a second version that replaces his hat with a dark azure helmet, two blue roller-skates, and gives him a hockey stick.</p>

<h3>The Boy</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;boy has common reddish brown hair, and a smiling face with green glasses with no alternate expression. He has a green hoodie jacket with the head of Lloyd from Ninjago on it, and on the back it has the name Lloyd on it. He has plain black small legs on him. He also has a second version that replaces his hair with a dark azure helmet, gives him red skates, and a hockey stick.</p>

<h3>The Girl</h3>

<p>The girl has a hair piece first found in Parker from hidden side, but with a red hat, and brown hair. She has a smiling expression with some freckles, and on the back she has a winking expression. Her body is in light bright orange I believe, with a light blue vest, a belt, and a&nbsp;necklace. She has plain blue medium legs.</p>

<h2><strong>Builds</strong></h2>

<p>There are two builds in this set, and they are the car, and the house.</p>

<h3>The Car</h3>

<p>The car has a simple, but nice build. It has four wheels that have dark azure hubcaps. On the front and back of the car there is a sticker for the license plate that has &ldquo;CK60291&rdquo; on it, and 60291 is the set number, and most of the time the sticker for the license plate has the set number in it. On the back of the car there are two red lights, and the front has two blue ones. The front of the car has a windshield, and above that is the roof that is black.&nbsp;You can take the roof off and inside you will find a steering wheel and a dashboard.</p>

<h3>The House</h3>

<p>Starting at the bottom of the house there are the new road plates that are nice and smooth, and they have slopes on the edges on both sides. There are two&nbsp;hockey goals in red on the road.</p>

<p>To the left of the house&nbsp;there is some grass with a picnic table with a hot dog and a drink on it. Next to that is a barrel where you can put the dog in for a bath, and in the barrel there is a brush, and next to the barrel is some dog poop. A little closer to the house there is a garden, probably growing carrots because there are some carrot sprout pieces. Right next to that is a charging station for the&nbsp;electric car (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s electric because the charging station has a sticker that says Octan E and I think the E means electric).</p>

<p>Moving to the house there is a garage that does not have a door that you can park the car into. To the right of that there is a door that leads to the T.V area. There is a lime green and black couch with a mug and a video game controller on it. there is also a T.V that has a sticker of some Ninjago game with Kai on it.</p>

<p>Next to that is a doorway that leads to the Kitchen. The Kitchen has an oven or pantry that has a cherry in it. above that is a stove and a blender with an apple in it.</p>

<p>Above the T.V area is an outdoor grill patio area. It has a grill with some meat on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The second floor of the house has a bathroom. It has a shower, a toilet, and a sink that has a sticker on the wall with a sink&nbsp;that says &ldquo;wash your hands&rdquo; on it, and some towels.</p>

<p>Next to that is what I am assuming is a play room that has a sticker on the wall that has some drawings on it. One of them has a dinosaur, one has a robot,&nbsp;one has a house with a tree and the sun,&nbsp;one has a Rocket ship on it,&nbsp;one has some scribbles on it, and the last one has a flower on it. Next to that is a guitar and a paint brush in a bucket.</p>

<p>The top level of the house has a Yellow and orange bed, and above that is a poster of a green dragon. To the&nbsp;right of that is a red sword, what I think is a stereo, and a trophy.</p>

<p>The roof of the house has dark blue slopes along with some solar panels.</p>

<p>The exterior of the house has lots of blue tinted windows. Along the middle of the house there are some vines growing on the walls. There is also this design that has these medium nougat 1x4 tiles that I am assuming are supposed to be some sort of wood panels.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>After all, this is a nice set, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a little overpriced considering that it only has 388 pieces and costs $60, but I can see why they did id, because a lot of that is probably because of the new road plates. If you want to grow your Lego city, or just like collection Lego, you should probably pick up this set, but if not, Its really up to you.</p>
