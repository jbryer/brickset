"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-04T16:59:03Z","Cool Sub","Well this is a rather big sub.It features a nice jail,but it ahs a bit too many colors.Without the dome the ship seems to be not very powerful,or is it just my mind?The set isn't so juniorized like some other 1998's sets 
(I'm thinking about the police station of the same year)
Well now to the interior:The cockpit lacks details, but the jail area is kinda cool.It seems that the ship is controlled,by the middle of it.The dome features really much space,too much for only one minifig.But I think it would be good as a cargo hold,because of the space in it.
All in all a cool set,but slightly simplified

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-29T22:10:41Z","Beautiful","The hydronauts were never as cool as the original aquanauts and they were a bit (not much) more juniorized. The colour scheme is great. Dark Green Rocks! The detachable sub is so cool too bad Aquazone wasn't continued. It was never as good as space, but it's so much better than Alpha Team.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-01T16:23:29Z","Quite Good","This sub is great because it has a lot of room in it.  It could fit about nine (9) guys (including in the jail and the detachable sub).  There are plenty of compartments and boxes for storage of crystals and other things.  

That detachable sub...... it is cool!  Those suction hoses are cool because they can pick up and drop off boxes.
This suub must be the biggest and best sub in the Hydronaut fleet! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-03T14:06:00Z","My Favorite!"," This set is totally cool. I love the submarines and how they merge together using magnets. I also use and have used this sets to build innumerable subs besides. I say this was and still is LEGO's best work.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T03:38:25.03Z","Awesome Set with cool features","I got very lucky when I came across this set on specail in Wal-mart for only 19.99. The original retail for this set was $59.99! Great set to build it does take sometime, but is very enjoyable to see how this super sub comes together. With my other Aquazone sets we have quite alot of activity going on under the sea. Great set - Get it if you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My mom got this set from a friend of hers when i took out the set's there were lot's of star wars sets and this set it took a long time to put together but when i was done i had a fun time playing with 
it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The jail cell feel of the center is cool, plus the panels have what appears to be a key-code lock (try using dynamite on that, western fans!). The set has many details, and each Hydronaut has their own headlight (which applies well to the series since the Stingrays dwell in the darkness) and the ship is brightly colored, with a nice scheme. The detachable ship has the two suction cups, which work, a stunning acheivement! Plenty of tools, and accessories, as well as a side cockpit for the other Hydronauts. In my opinion, the overall Hydronaut minifigure design is awesome. The set is a decent buy if you can find it used for at most $20 (good luck) and is my personal 2nd favorite sub. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
