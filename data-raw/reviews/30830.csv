<p>Modularity (with caveats--see below), stoplights (with caveats--see below), and streetlights.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Price: $20US is just too much for road plates; lights (stop/street), signs, and vegetation simply aren&#39;t necessary for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/list-120"">road baseplates</a>. I got this set for a little less (around $16) but I believe LEGO should re-issue the road baseplates (which were $6-7 for 2 up until 2005 when LEGO greedily doubled the price for some reason) from the late 1970s (grey), 1986 (bike lanes: <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6310-1/"">6310</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6311-1/"">6311</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6312-1/"">6312</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6313-1/"">6313</a>), and 1997 (green sides: <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6320-1/"">6320</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6321-1/"">6321</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6322-1/"">6322</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6323-1/"">6323</a>). The 2002, 2005, and 2019 road baseplates have dashed/dotted sidelines which don&#39;t fit with United States roads (but the center/middle dashed lines are spaced more accurately than previous road baseplates). The straight sections have unnecessary sewer drainage grates at both ends; the drains should be at intersections only or, at most, 1 on each straight section but even that will be too many when using multiple straight sections; I would rather build drains and/or use a sticker if I really wanted them.</li>
	<li>Height: I know this would negate using all the tiles (flat and ridged) but I can do a better modular road plate system with various baseplates and tiles anyway if desired. The main point of a lower, 1-plate height is to match up with old road baseplates without needing ramps.</li>

<p>These new sets came to me as a surprise, and my initial reaction was not good, as I&#39;d spent years slowly building up a collection of the normal road base plates - particularly the straight.</p>

<p>So now, to have an entirely different system, one that at first glance isn&#39;t even compatible, went down like a lead balloon.</p>

<p>But, I bought myself several and began to experiment, and the results where surprising...</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Far more flexibility in road width, from narrower / single lane, up to massive freeways.</li>
	<li>Is an actual playable &#39;set&#39; - has way more value for kids.</li>
	<li>Is &#39;In system&#39; (2 plates height).</li>
	<li>Can be connected to original style base plate models (eg modulars).</li>
	<li>Cities no longer need to be dominated by the perfect 32x32 grid layout.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>No corners!</li>
	<li>They drive up the price of sets they are in massively.</li>
	<li>If you buy more than 1 of these, the multiples of ramp pieces soon adds up (but they could make for nice roof tiles, so...)</li>
	<li>Could do with more of the printed 2x4 tiles with white lines.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>These are great! Seriously!</p>

<p>Honestly any problems I see with them are fixable and in some cases laughable: That they come with no corners is a problem, but one LEGO is likely to fix in the future. And, if your goal (like mine) is to have the pavement/sidewalk raised up a couple of plates, then you can actually build your own corners with angled plates.</p>

<p>Regarding the price, what you get is more useful for a city than the baseplates. These come out nominally as more expensive, but for those of us with a large city, how many times have we bemoaned the fact that every straight road baseplate bought came with an annoying and mostly useless cross road baseplate? This is, in my opinion, a far better use of my money as it comes with minimal &#39;wastage&#39;.</p>

<p>And as for how these affect the price of sets, that is a concern, but easily mitigated - don&#39;t buy those&nbsp;sets and stick to this road set, it is mostly what you need.</p>

<p>My city no longer needs to be locked to the 32x32 grid! I can have buildings of any width and know I can build roads that match up exactly. Road widths can vary (as they should!), and lanes can be separated. If you have plenty of tiles to expand, there&#39;s so much flexibility here it is awesome.</p>

<p>This set was designed more for children than adults, that much is clear. There&#39;s so much more &#39;realism&#39; and playability in it than a straight pack of baseplates it isn&#39;t even funny. Kids should rightly love these. Even though this isn&#39;t my use case, it certainly warranted a mention as it appears most people angry about these are AFOLs (which, while unmerited I think, is at least understandable).</p>

<p><em>Finally - in case you weren&#39;t aware, plates under a normal baseplate means the top of the baseplate is exactly 2 plates high. So for those of us with models on normal bases such as modular buildings, if you have a selection of unused plates, simply put them underneath and voil&agrave;, you can connect them to these plates with no problem!</em></p>

"OzToymaker","2021-04-30T07:54:32.33Z","Good start","<p>Got one set as an experiment, and was very happy with the outcome. &nbsp;I&#39;ll need to upgrade the modular so their base height matches, but I prefer the new height rather than the thin base plates currently used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve created a better roadway around my small collection using 4 sets. &nbsp;At some stage I may replace the speed bumps, but not a big deal. &nbsp;Hope they come up with more variations in the future.</p>

"Minifig290","2021-06-11T22:38:06.487Z","Are they as good as baseplates?","<p>Hey, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at the 2021 LEGO City 60304 Road Plates set that offers the cheapest way to obtain some new for 2021 Road Plates replacing the Base Plates. This set has 112 pieces and retails for &pound;17.99 / $19.99 giving a price per part of 16p / 17p.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at this new system of plates by starting with the actual plates.</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>In this set you get 4 large road plates and a smaller crossing plate. Starting with the four large plate, they are 16x16 wide and two plates high in dark grey. The top of the plate is tiled off apart from four 2x4 studs that are resected in for a 2x4 tile plus around the edges there is space for two 1x4 plates on each side which you can use to attach plates to other road plates building your road layouts.</p>

<p>In the 2x4 and 1x4 empty spaces, there are a few tiles to fill them in depending on what you want. Firstly you get a total of 10 2x4 dark grey tiles with a white line printed to separate traffic and make lanes, there are 19 unprinted 2x4 dark grey tiles to connect plates and also fill in any other tiles in the plates where you don&#39;t need a white line also they can be used to connect some accessory bits which I&#39;ll talk about in a bit to the road plates. Additionally, you also get 8 1x4 dark grey tiles&nbsp;to fill in any remaining studded areas in the road plates.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a smaller road plate which is the same as the other one but just half the size with 8x16 size and space for just one 2x4 tile with 6 places for 1x4 tiles to connect plates together. The main difference to this plate apart from its size is that is has printing for a Zebra Crossing or Junction point depending on what you want to use it for. This plate has options to add four 2x4 pyramid pieces which are 2 plates high that represent some speed bumps approaching the crossing point.</p>

<p>In total your get 5 plates which you can use to make a few layouts with such as a T Junction, Straight and you could also try a Crossroad, but sadly it is quite hard to make a Curved layout as there are not really many realistic options for a Curve plate using the pieces in this set</p>

<p><strong>Other Builds</strong></p>

<p>Alongside the road plates there are some other bits and bobs to decorate your city&#39;s road layout with. Let&#39;s start with the important bits for road infrastructures.</p>

<p>There are two identical street lamps that have glow in the dark features. The lights are built using a large light grey pole piece with 1x2 studs at one end and a single studs towards the other end. The end with stud is placed at the bottom into a black clip piece which is attacked to a 2x2 plate with two studs on end and a clip on the other on a 4x4 green plate. At the top of the light there are a couple clipped plates to give some pose ability&nbsp;with the angle that the light can be placed with a 1x4 dark blue printed tile printed with a solar panel. At the end of that tile is an awesome 1x2 glow in the dark tile which is activated when light is shone at it for a while and works pretty well in a dark environment.</p>

<p>On thing, I don&#39;t like with the lights are that they use clip pieces in colours that stand out for the wrong reasons, the majority of the light is light grey, but the bottom clip is black and the top is dark grey which doesn&#39;t look good imo, would have preferred at least the top clip being dark grey as it would have looked much better.</p>

<p>Next there are two identical traffic lights that are built in a style commonly&nbsp;seen in most of Europe than in the US. Build on top of a light grey pole piece with a 2x2 wide base, on the top of this piece is a 1x1 studded area. The actual Traffic Light is built using 3 1x1 bricks with stud on one side in black with a transparent&nbsp;1x1 round tile in the typical traffic light order, green at the bottom, then yellow and finally&nbsp;red. Topping off the light is a 1x1 tooth plate piece in black. The traffic lights are also on a 4x4 green plate each.</p>

<p>Now, you also get two road signs which imo are quite nice to have as they are not as common as other parts of this set. There are two variants of signs, a Pedestrian Crossing sign and a 50 MPH (though can represent KPH). Each sign is on the same base piece as the traffic lights.</p>

<p>The sign piece for the Crossing Sign is the size of a 2x2 tile, at the back with a clip to attach it to a pole. The printing on the sign is a LEGO-fied version of a common Crossing Sign seen in most parts of Europe with a blue background with a white triangle showing. Inside that triangle there is black printing for a minifigure crossing a crosswalk. This sign piece only comes in this set and the more expensive Shopping Street set from this year. The Crosswalk sign is on a 8x4 green plate and attaches to the crosswalk road piece with a printed 2x4 tile with the white line.</p>

<p>Then the 50 MPH Road Sign is the size of a round 2x2 tile, like the other sign it has a clip to attach it to a pole. The printing on the sign has a red boarder with black text showing 50. This piece has been seen in a couple other sets but isn&#39;t too common. The 50 sign is on a 4x4 green plate.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>The final bits of accessories are some decorative ones, this set includes a couple botanical pieces to brighten up your road sides. Each bit of botanical bits are on a 8x4 green plate and tbh are basically the same with a minor colour swaps.</p>

<p>Each 8x4 plate has a small green tree piece which uses the plants from plants material. Then each plate has a small flower on a light green leaf. The one flower uses red flowers and the other uses bright orange.</p>

<p>At one edge of each 8x4 plate with the botanical accessories on are a few dark grey tiles to smoothly be added on the roadside connecting to a road plate.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well the big question is, is this new road system better than the old baseplates? Well my opinion is yes, but it does have a couple flaws, the largest being the lack of the ability to create curves in your road layouts without having to use pieces from other sets.</p>

<p>The actual plates are good and can see them being popular and more popular than the old plates even if they don&#39;t work perfectly with the Modular Buildings. The added accessories such as road signs, streetlights, traffic lights and botanical accessories are welcome additions, especially the hard to find Crosswalk and 50mph road signs.</p>

<p>Are these worth &pound;17.99 or $19.99?, well for what you get it&#39;s not too bad though I&#39;d personally wait for a good price, I managed to score two for half price during a crazy sale at Amazon. It will be perfect for any LEGO City display even those with the old plates.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Crosswalk, Road Signs, Great Accessories, Fair price for what you&#39;re getting</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Lack of curves, streetlights using multiple colours of clips</p>

"sammyjeanking","2021-05-12T10:45:23.09Z","Really love them","<p>I purchased 2 of the road plates sets and I have to say they are really good and look really nice once laid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have increased the height of the actual road plates by 1 plate studs using a 2x2 plate under each of the corners and in the middle. This is to raise it up so I can run a train line to the side and build this in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a consequence of this I have had to raise my modular buildings by 1&nbsp;brick height to accommodate. As the existing base board sits on top of a normal brick this is raised by 11/12mm</p>

<p>What would be great going forward is if the Road plates set has a number of matching coloured 2x2 plates to add to the bottom and that all, modular&#39;s now come with an additional design and additional bricks/plates to allow for 2 plates increase to line up with the road plates and also a brick height frame to line up with the setting I have used. This would save the purchasing of additional items to finish the look and will also give the builder options depending on whether new road plates or old road plates are being used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do of course need to purchase lots of dark grey and light grey Tiles to fully fit my city but the road plates really fit in well. With the old plates you had to use these parts as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the old plates are combined with the modular buildings it makes the pavement too wide as there is already pavement built into the modular&#39;s but the old road plates are good if you are adding them to older features including houses, fire stations, hospitals, petrol stations etc but my city is split into 2 areas so I intend to use a combination of new with old.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am looking forward to buying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"nathanm19","2021-07-12T07:02:24.137Z","Very Customizable","<p>The new road system is very customizable. Since these are now in system parts, it&#39;s much easier to build bridges and overpasses using this set. The basic layout they have you build is a bit thin, but you can place all four pieces together and get a 32x32 road wide enough for the new 8-wide Speed Champions vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some complaints I have with this set is the obvious price per part ration. You are getting 112 pieces in this set including the roads themselves, parts for street lights,&nbsp;stop lights,&nbsp;road signs,&nbsp;a crosswalk and speed bumps. Even with the larger pieces, it&#39;s still upsetting that this set is 5 dollars more expensive than the previous road system. If they had included extra 2x4 dark grey tiles to allow for further customization should you not want to use the median dashes, the cost might be more justifiable to me. Another complaint I have is just how blemished the roads look with the pieces in comparison to the previous road plates smooth look. Just a personal preference of mine though and I can overlook that considering the versatility of these roads.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a more positive note, there aren&#39;t any stickers in the set, it is all printed pieces. I personally do not like stickers and am very happy with the printed crosswalk and median dashes! The accessories included in this set are great for new cities, and you&#39;ll find after buying a few of them that you&#39;ll have an over-abundance of decorations for your town. My favourite feature of this set that there are now studs on the bottom of the road plates. They are raised up to the height of 1 plate and 1 tile, so modular buildings and will have to be raised up as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;d recommend these for new city builders over the old system. Even if you&#39;re heavily invested in the old road baseplates, there are still uses for these in your city in builds such as highways and bridges.&nbsp;</p>

"m76","2022-02-10T09:29:14.493Z","Terrible set","<p>I purchased this set to compliment my modular buildings, but it is very disappointing.</p>

<p>It is very limited, you can&#39;t even build a single proper intersection from it.</p>

<p>It looks awful, due to how it is made of mismatched tiles. It does not match other street elements either. The supposed bumps seem more like barriers.</p>

<p>The build experience is not great either, it&#39;s lots of trial and error and customization is limited due to the limited number of parts included.</p>

<p>The supposed glow pieces don&#39;t really glow at all, unless you shine a very strong light source directly at them, and even then they fade very quickly.</p>

<p>The classical road plates are worth much more than this, I wish Lego still sold those.</p>
