Nice way to get some new Marvel minifigures and a small build on the side.</p>

<p>The set is a great representation of the movie Eternals: a dud.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the good &#39;parts&#39;, being the parts.<br />
If you are low on gold pieces and &#39;transparent sword brown no.20&#39;, this box ups your piece counter nicely. The dark blue is appealing as well.</p>

<p>The minifigures however disappoint. They both get it wrong. Where Ikaris has a beautifully printed torso and leg, the hair colour is simply wrong. And I don&#39;t understand why Lego only sparsely uses foldable medium-sized&nbsp;legs and always resorts back to those annoying rigid short leg pieces. It is also inconsistent with the character&nbsp;Sprite and her age. It makes for bland, non printed legs that in this case contrast too much with the Ikaris ones.</p>

<p>The flying deviant is plain and simple not even worth building.&nbsp;<br />
The Deviants in Eternals aren&#39;t the most beautiful creatures around but even taken that into account, the flying Deviant in the set is ugly. It has an annoying greebly build and for a small set as this too repetitive. It is asymmetrical in its structure and too flimsy to have any play value.<br />
And it comes with stickers - 5 stickers. Strangely enough 6 bricks have a fairly similar print/decor but one of them comes already printed. The other 5 need vexatious stickers.</p>

<p>I did buy this set because of the discount and because of the minifigs; but to be honest, those don&#39;t even make for a worthy purchase.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Arishem, do net get attached to this Lego line.</p>
