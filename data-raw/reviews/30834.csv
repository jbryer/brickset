<h3>Build</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve built any of the mech armors Lego has released lately, this build will feel very familiar to you. The shoulders are very reminiscent of the previous&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76141-1/Thanos-Mech"">Thanos Mech</a>&nbsp;from 2020. However, there are no stickers on this set, as compared to those of the year prior in which there were stickers everywhere from shoulders to toes (literally). The pieces themselves are a good mix of red, white, and navy blue, suitable for the first avenger. Some highlights include: the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6329741/flat-tile-2x2-round-no-1176"">chest shield</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6330153/design-brick-4x3x3-w-3-2-shaft-no-1"">chest plate</a>&nbsp;new in dark blue, and of course the giant&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6329742/round-plate-%C3%B864x9-6-no-8"">shield</a>&nbsp;piece that would theoretically stay an exclusive piece to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>There is one minifigure in this set, the first avenger himself, Captain America! He is currently exclusive to this set, but I can see him being released again later down the line. His torso is the only exclusive part of him but has some brilliant light blue highlights, and he also has red gloves. His legs are also dark blue but sadly unprinted. His face and helmet also are the same from the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76143-1/Avengers-Truck-Take-down"">Avengers truck takedown</a>&nbsp;set. Of course his accessory is his iconic vibranium shield, though I&#39;m not a huge fan of the black outer rim. Overall, the captain certainly does not disappoint, and I&#39;m a huge fan!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>As like all the mechs, the chest piece folds down to let a minifigure stand in there, with his legs semi-attaching to a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6115086/foot-plate"">foot plate</a>. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve noticed with my older ones that with time, the legs lose friction and don&#39;t hold on well. The giant shield can attach to his wrist and then be taken off and placed&nbsp;on his back. I&#39;ve encountered no problems there. As for articulation, the shoulders are on mini ball joints, as well as the elbows (and I mean that lightly, as they are quite high to be elbows), wrists, knees, and ankles. The waist also rotates on a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6279875/connector-peg-w-friction"">friction pin</a>&nbsp;but is still blocked by a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6266244/plate-1x2-w-stub-vertical"">clip piece</a>&nbsp;that can easily be removed, as it restricts 360 degree waist movement. I&#39;ve been able to get the mech into some pretty dynamic poses, I can&#39;t show pictures, but it does look good. The arm with the shield on can&#39;t exactly get all the way in front of the body but it&#39;s pretty close and forgivable. Lastly (and I almost forgot) there&#39;s a clip on the back of the right leg that Captain America&#39;s little shield can clip on to. The mech looks slightly akward with it attached but when it&#39;s not on it&#39;s not a big deal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Overall, I like this set. And like the other mechs I have, it&#39;s a great price ($10!) for a small, but still substantial mech and a great minifigure. Like the figure but not the mech? That&#39;s ok because this set has some exclusive and fairly rare pieces in dark blue and red.&nbsp;</p>

"graymattr","2021-08-30T04:01:36.403Z","Shield envy!","<p>When I see a Lego mech, I look at it for a bit and then move on.&nbsp; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t hate them -- I have a bunch of the Exo-Force, Mars Mission and RoboForce mechs from years ago -- I&#39;m more into cars, planes and Star Wars vehicles.&nbsp; Well, this mech is different in many ways.</p>

<p><u>The Minifigure</u></p>

<p>This is a great Captain America minifigure with printing on both sides of the torso and head.&nbsp; He includes a removable helmet (that has printing on it) which is an upgrade over the initial Cap figs that had helmets painted on the head. The minifigure includes the Captain America shield. The legs do not have printing which is a shame but there are things that make up for it.&nbsp; For example:</p>

<p><u>The Giant Shield!</u></p>

<p>This mech has a 8x8 shield with the Captain America logo printed on it.&nbsp; It&#39;s spectacular.&nbsp; It can attach on the back of the mech suit or attach to the arm as if he is holding it.&nbsp; The giant shield piece and the minifigure are the main draws for me.&nbsp; But wait, there&#39;s more!&nbsp; He also has a round tile on the chest of the mech with the Captain America logo printed on it.&nbsp; That&#39;s right, you get three Captain America shields in this set!</p>

<p><u>The Mech</u></p>

<p>This mech uses ball joints in the shoulders, wrists, hips, knees and ankles which gives it quite a lot of poseability.&nbsp; The feet are too big in my opinion but they let you pose the mech sturdily.&nbsp; The cockpit opens by lowering the chest piece on hinges.&nbsp; The poseability offers a lot of play opportunity for kids.&nbsp; It also offers a really good variety of pieces for use in other builds.&nbsp; You also get seven silver ingots to use in your next bank robbery or sunken treasure scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Conclusion</u></p>

<p>This is a very good value for the variety of pieces, especially if you factor in the printed shield pieces and a minifigure.&nbsp; This is easily recommended for any Marvel Comics fan but also for anyone else for the good mech suit.</p>
