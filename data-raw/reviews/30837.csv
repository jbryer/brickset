<p data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">Miles is just incredible and unique. It&#39;s very rare to see a hero wearing casual clothes over his uniform. He&#39;s wearing a dark red hoodie&nbsp;and a pair of shorts over his black uniform. The hoodie is very detailed, with the character&#39;s mask on the back and even as strings for the hood. The hood, is a very welcome piece and combines much more with an urban outfit than the classic Star Wars hoods. Dual-molded legs in a $10 set is also great, although the fact that the legs are not visible in the cabin&nbsp;makes me want to put them in a Batman minifigure with gray suit. Frankly, the figure is so good that the set&nbsp;wouldn&#39;t be so desirable&nbsp;if they simply had included Miles in the black uniform.</p>

<p data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr""><strong>The build&nbsp;and playability</strong></p>

<p data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">You get a mech at a decent price. The colours&nbsp;combine&nbsp;with Miles minifigure, with black, gray and red pieces. The webs, for the first time in transparent light blue, stand out with the main colours. They represent Miles&#39; electric webs and are exclusive to this set for now.</p>

<p data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">The mech measures 10 cm in height and has 12 spherical joints plus swivelling waist. The joints are firm and capable of great poseability. You can move the&nbsp;fingers to punch, make the classic web-launching hand or even obscene gestures. The arms are very long, but you can easily ignore this as you bend them at the 3 points of articulation. The feet are strangely thin (I suspect it&#39;s to represent a pair of sneakers), but they are firm and provide stability, although larger feet look better on mechs. There is no stud to attach Miles to the mech and therefore it doesn&#39;t have enough friction to keep him firmly in the cabin; it will be loose as a child plays with the mech. The set has no stickers: the piece on the chest is printed.</p>

<p data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr""><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>

<p data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">Cheap, a well articulated and firm mech, a sensational minifigure with electric web parts. Definitely worthy.</p>
