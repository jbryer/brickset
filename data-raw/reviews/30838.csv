<p>Buld-wise, this is nothing to write home about. Certainly for adult builders it offers nothing, but may be of interest to younger builders.</p>

<p>The parts are quire good. Th main attraction is the Spiderman figure with the printed arms. Shame about the plain legs, but still a good figure.</p>

<p>The new &quot;quad bike&quot; shells are also quite versatile. I converted it to a trike as that seems to fit this set a little better, but I can also see me using it as a basis for other builds &mdash; I&#39;m particularly intrigued about the possibility to use them as the basis for agricultural trailers &amp; accessories.</p>

<p>There is also the re-coloured technic pin without friction (part 3673) in yellow.</p>

<p>It&#39;s got pretty basic play function: the quad bike, a mini catapult &amp; the 2 minifigs. My daughter isn&#39;t into superheroes, so wasn&#39;t much interested.</p>

<p>As for value, depends on how much you value to Spiderman figure &amp; like the look of the quad bike. For those, I found it decent value as an AFOL.</p>
