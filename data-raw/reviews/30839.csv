The one thing a lot of people are buying the set for is for Ghost-Rider. Only 2 Ghost-Rider minifigs exist. I don&#39;t own the original Spider-Man and Ghost-Rider team-up but i somewhat prefer it more than the 2021 team-up. Overall i give it a 4/5.</p>

"graymattr","2021-06-04T02:45:17.35Z","Vengeance for your wallet!","<p>Super Heroes sets usually fall into two categories in my opinion, sets with great vehicles or sets with great minifigures and a generic vehicle thrown in to make the set piece count fit a need.&nbsp; This set is both - a great vehicle with great minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This model is based on the Marvel Comics car Ghost Rider drives, a 1969 Dodge Charger, coined the &quot;Hell Charger.&quot;&nbsp; The model is a excellent representation of the actual car and can accommodate Ghost Rider to sit in it but no passengers. The car looks really souped up with the larger rear tires and the air intake. Angles and proportions of the car match the source material as well as Lego pieces allow. The front grill and rear bumper and lights look really well done. There are some good building techniques to make these two end of the car look so well.</p>

<p>The instructions give you direction to build the car in &quot;normal mode&quot; and in &quot;Hell mode&quot; where transparent orange firebursts are added to the wheels, undercarriage, rear exhaust and the air intake.&nbsp; Both modes look equally good and give you a good play feature of changing back and forth.&nbsp; My only complaint is that the set only provides two of the larger firebursts which attach to the wheels, the largest plugged into the rear wheel and the other plugged into the front tire. But you only get enough to add fire to one side of wheels. All of the other flames are placed symmetrically on the car.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This version of Spider-Man is new for 2021 but included in other sets.&nbsp; It is well done and based on the comics. It has printing on both sides of the torso and the arms which looks really good. Unfortunately his legs are not printed or dual molded for boots. I still like this minifig.</p>

<p>Ghost Rider is the minifig that drew me to this set the most. This is a new minifig and exclusive to this set (so far.) The torso is printed on both sides to represent his new style leather jacket. Hi legs are not printed but that&#39;s not a detriment since he wears black leather pants so it&#39;s not necessary. Ghost Rider&#39;s face is a new print on a pearl silver head with transparent orange flames attached that cannot be removed. I have an issue with the design of the face because it looks more like a mad robot than a skull. I prefer the head that was included in set #76058 or something more skeleton-like.</p>

<p>The Carnage minifigure has intricate printing on the front and back of the torso and on the hips, legs and toes which looks fantastic. His arms are not printed but the back of his head is. This is currently listed as exclusive to this set but in actuality it&#39;s the same body with different appendages. I quite like this minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I highly recommend this set to everyone that is a Marvel Comics fan or a fan of six-wide cars. You get three excellent minifigures and a fantastic car for a really good price point which is no small feat with the generally rising prices of Lego.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-08-28T11:59:17.347Z","How perfect would this have been if it was released in 2017 with two of the figures swapped out?","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Robbie Reyes (this sets version of Ghost Rider), since watching &ldquo;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&rdquo;(AoS)&nbsp;in the earlier months of this year&nbsp;has become one of my favourite superheroes out of the entire roster&nbsp;(DC, Marvel, etcetera) so when I went back to look at some Marvel sets from earlier this year I once again happened upon this set, and it retook its spot on my wanted list immediately, and&nbsp;I eventually got it as a bonus with&nbsp;my 2021 May 4th Lego Star Wars haul, and I must say AoS and Marvel Comics fans will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>The minifigures-</p>

<p>Starting of with Spider-man, Why is he included ? Because Lego cannot release superheroes set without him or Batman, the head was new for 2021 with a new eye design, the torso is nice with fun arm printing, and he has plain blue legs, and&nbsp;his accessories are two white power blasts for webs. Next we have Carnage he has the same head as before, an outrider neck attachment, with four dark red exo-force arms attached, with red symbiote spikes on each end, his torso and legs are also reused from before. And last but definitely not least we have Ghost Rider&nbsp;his head is the same piece from 2016 with a silver head with new printing, his iconic leather jacket with white decoration on his torso and plain black legs, unfortunately they don&#39;t include his notorious hellfire chain, but luckily transparent&nbsp;orange long chains aren&#39;t particularly uncommon, so I use an extra I have to complete his look and I must say he looks fantastic.</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build represents his 1969 Dodge Charger, however this car sets on fire and is basically indestructible, in universe. The&nbsp;front uses an interesting upside down technique to get the slope effect with 1x2 silver modified plates and two 1x1 transparent clear round tiles for headlights, the sides are built with a snot technique and the centre uses a light grey 1x4 grooved plate for the intake. There is a CMF&nbsp;stand at the front with the intake built with three light grey stud shooters and slopes with transparent orange studs on the end, behind it and on each side it is tiled off with a transparent black windscreen and a 4x4 black jumper plate, slopes then go down the back with a central 2x2 transparent clear slope brick for the rear window. The rear of the car is even more tiled than the front,&nbsp;the taillights are 1x2 transparent red tiles over white bricks to give it a glowing perspective which looks amazing, the base of the back is sloped inwards, the inside of the car has space for one figure with a light grey steering wheel, speaking of wheels the forward most two are smaller than the rear to give the Hellcharger an intimidating stance and the sides both have a snot technique attaching some 1x1 and 1x2 black cheese slopes to accomplish the inward sloping. Finally, this set includes a pack of the &ldquo;action blast and splat&rdquo; pieces in transparent orange first seen in the 76097 Lex Luthor Mech Takedown, theses are intended to be used to transform the car into a flame version, so you remove a 1x2 black double cheese slope from the back and attach the two small flames, remove another double cheese slope from each side and attach the two bigger flames with clips on them, then two power blasts with transparent yellow cones to bulk out the otherwise 2D seeming flames, now after this you are still left with a big and little splat, which they say attach to the wheels, I&nbsp;personally this looks stupid, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it and two spirals for you to use on your own for something.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is an amazing set for any level of Marvel fan especially one of ghost rider or &ldquo;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&rdquo;, however I have some issues; no1 where is Ghost Riders chain, no2 where is the normal Robbie Reyes head and hair no3 why are Spider-Man and Carnage included, I get that they are recognisable, but we get them so often, wouldn&#39;t it have been cool if this was an AoS season 4 set and instead of Spider-Man we got Quake and instead of Carnage we got A.I.D.A. so we can still have a superhero team up just not with an overdone character and against an overused character, but anyway I&nbsp;highly recommend this and let&#39;s&nbsp;hope for some more &ldquo;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&rdquo; inspired sets in future with the 10th anniversary of season 1 coming up in 2023.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-10-07T11:39:28.667Z","Iâ€™m on a highway to hell!","<p>The Spider-Man subtheme is generally uninteresting IMO. It&rsquo;s filled with a lot of repetitive and unnecessary Spider vehicles as well as shoehorning Venom into almost every set. But what&rsquo;s this? A non-Spider Man vehicle that actually looks interesting? Oh boy, this would surely make an awesome set.</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>The Dodge Charger:</b> Now, I&rsquo;m not the most familiar with Ghost Rider&nbsp;&nbsp;but from what I&rsquo;ve seen, this is based off Ghost Rider&rsquo;s 1969 Dodge Charger otherwise known as the &ldquo;Hell Charger&rdquo;. The build for this car felt very clever and unique to me, it employs interesting building techniques and the overall smoothness and appearance of the model is outstanding. As for what you can do with it, the windshield and roof easily pop off for access to the simple interior which has a single space for a minifigure to sit down and a steering wheel is present as well. The engine valves are represented as 3 stud shooters and of course, those add extra play value, and although I&rsquo;m not completely sold on the look, I think it works well enough. Finally, Lego made clever use of the &ldquo;blast and splat&rdquo; parts in trans-orange to make the vehicle fire up, 3 black 1x2 cheese slopes are taken off and replaced by those pieces, you can place flames on the wheels as well. Overall, the execution of this vehicle is fantastic, it looks great. It&rsquo;s perfect for play or display and it surprisingly provided a very interesting and engaging build experience.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Ghost Rider: </b>I personally don&rsquo;t recognize this version of Ghost Rider and prefer the original Johnny Blaze figure, but he&rsquo;s still a nice figure and the only one exclusive to this set as well. Starting from the legs, it&rsquo;s just in plain black and the torso is a fairly simple-looking black suit with some white and orange outlines that are printed at the back as well. Finally, the fantastic flaming &ldquo;hair&rdquo; element introduced with the first Ghost Rider figure returns in the same color, the face has a mechanical look to it with orange eyes and sharp teeth. Overall, the best attribute of the figure is certainly the flame &ldquo;hair&rdquo;, it looks stunning as always. Some leg printing would be nice, but the rest of the figure remains pretty good.</p>

<p><b>Spider-Man:</b> Of course, you get the (spider) man himself in this set. His legs are just plain blue and his torso is a standard-looking spidey suit, the arms feature printing though which sounds nice on paper, but the outcome is unfortunately not very good, the red printed on blue just looks all muddy and dull which really sucks. His head is a new print for 2021 and it just gives off the good ole classic spidey look. Finally, Spider-Man comes with 2 power blasts in white. Overall, I still appreciate the presence of arm printing despite it not being good, if it was produced better I would like this figure a lot more, but as it stands, it&rsquo;s ok and could use improvement.</p>

<p><b>Carnage: </b>Carnage appears pretty often in the Spider-Man subtheme, but I don&rsquo;t mind his inclusion here since it&rsquo;s my first time getting him. The torso and legs feature printing of jagged black lines and the detailing is nice, some arm printing like the 2015 version would&rsquo;ve been great though. Carnage comes with the outrider neck bracket to attach 4 additional arms/tentacles, and I must say, I really love the look and effect of it. Finally, his face print has his signature large white eyes and sharp teeth, additional black lines are printed on the back of the head as well. Overall, while he&rsquo;s nothing special in terms of exclusivity, it&rsquo;s nice to acquire him here and I love how they did the extra tentacles/limbs.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set costs R350 for full price and it feels a bit much. The car just isn&rsquo;t big enough to fully warrant that price. It&rsquo;s still not too bad but a discount would certainly be ideal.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set exceeded my expectations, the Dodge Charger is a fantastic and well thought out model and the integration of the blast and splat pieces was pretty clever as well. The minifigures that accompany it are pretty fun and enjoyable too. The value is ok, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel too bad paying it at full price. In conclusion, I would certainly recommend picking this set up, especially if you&rsquo;re an avid collector of Lego cars or Marvel sets.</p>
