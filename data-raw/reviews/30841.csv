The main thing I adore is those minifigs, Big Time Suit, Perfected Iron Spider, Classic Comic Book Spidey, and a pretty cool Homemade looking beginner suit.&nbsp; Plus Venom and the best Goblin to date? Recipe for one of the best selections of figs in a Spider-Man set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is okay, it&#39;s a huge base for Spidey, an idea that&#39;s been done before, and I do like the execution. But, there are some rather childish parts, the bike and skateboard aren&#39;t necessary for Peter. Same with the hoop. Everything else, like the computer and the awesome Cabinets for the suits are awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set it pretty freaking cool for huge Spider-Man fans, I&#39;d recommend it, even though it could be a little cheaper.&nbsp;</p>
