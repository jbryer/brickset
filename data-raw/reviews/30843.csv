"KingTyrannos","2021-01-01T23:33:16.65Z","8 years in the making, the Overlord descends!","<p><font color=""#444444""><span style=""caret-color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The Overlord is one of Ninjago&#39;s most iconic villains, really comparable only to Lord Garmadon. While he has appeared in a few other&nbsp;sets, this is the first time he has appeared in his &quot;true&quot; form, a massive dragon! Despite this form making its spectacular debut in the Ninjago television series in 2013, it hasn&#39;t appeared in set form until now.</span></font></p>

<p>71742-1 Overlord Dragon contains two figures; one&nbsp;of Golden Lloyd Garmadon, and an exclusive Overlord figure. While this figure of Golden&nbsp;Lloyd has appeared previously, in 71702,&nbsp;as well as in 70666, minus the sword sheath/pauldron on his back for the former, the incision of the figure is to be expected, and if you haven&#39;t picked up these already, it&#39;s a good chance to get the definitive version of the figure. The Overlord also appears here, with a new figure, strangely based off his appearance as the Golden Master in Ninjago: Rebooted, versus his Final Battle appearance. An impressive figure, no doubt, but I believe the version included in 70666 and 71699 is a superior rendition of the character. Lloyd comes with a pearl gold katana, and the Overlord comes with a purple lightning bolt. But the figures are not what make this set great, on to the dragon itself.</p>

<p><strong>The Overlord Dragon:</strong><br />
The Overlord dragon is impressive for its size, with a sizeable wingspan and a body that makes it suitable to fight 71702 in a duel! The figure has a new head piece, beautifully fitting the character, and ingeniously uses the same piece for both the upper head and mandible; however, because of the complexity of the mould, I didn&#39;t even notice until later inspection. The Overlord as a dragon, while not quite the largest in the series,&nbsp;is impressive regardless. While some have taken umbrage with the colouring, I believe it makes the model stand out much better than if it was just purple and black, and the Golden Armour on his chest is clever and adds flair to the model. The wings are easily posable, and while I originally disliked the position of the claws, it has grown on me. As for my main gripe, it has the &quot;swooshy&quot; tail that has plagued the theme for a while. It is incredibly hard to pose, and moves around far too much in my opinion, though not as egregiously as in 70679 or 71721-1. If I could make one change, I think fabric wings with holes, akin to those in 71721-1 would look amazing, but the &quot;sword wings&quot; fit early Ninjago style, fit with 70666, and I didn&#39;t really expect a large fabric piece in a set of this price point. Overall, the dragon looks excellent, just large enough to strike terror into the ninja, but small enough to fit into almost any set-up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the price of $29.99 represents great value in my opinion, and while I am not as familiar with pounds&nbsp;or Euro as currency, their value is comparable, and so the value of the set should translate across borders. The debut&nbsp;of the Overlord dragon&nbsp;in set form does not disappoint, and I&#39;d suggest it to anyone who loves Ninjago, or is a general fan of LEGO dragons.</p>
