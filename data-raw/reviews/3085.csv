"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-01T11:13:08Z","needs more, but very good","This is a pretty decent set. It could use some computers for the aquanauts to use, as someone else said. And there is two boxes for the crystals, but I had some spares. The main attraction to this set is the conveyer belt, but on mine I used too many links and it didn't work properly. The main problem is that, when disassembled, you can't (or I can't) really use the big blue doors or blue back pieces for anything else. One side door is too small. This is a very good set though, despite the flaws. It has a nice number of figs, although I would like an aquanaut scientist, without a diving suit, to stay inside. The crane is spring-loaded and a very nice trans-blue. The sub is nice but has little room in the back. Very good overall. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

One of them involved a range of yellow underwater models.  Funny how things turn out.  Anyhow, this set is the best of the underwater bases.  In fact it's up there with the likes of the Town Carnival Scene, Pirate Dark Shark and Blacktron 1 Base as one of the greatest Lego sets ever made.  There is a wealth of useful pieces, and the set comes complete with control centres, a crane, a submarine as well as minifigs and sea creatures.

"StormSworder","2007-04-22T20:54:01.787Z","A great set","This is, in my view, the apex of the Aquazone theme.  It is a dramatic-looking undersea base with large opening doors, a moving conveyer belt and a crane to move cargo.  There is a landing platform for the submarine and a separate control centre housed under a trans-blue dome.  The set comes with a wealth of pieces, is an all-time classic.

"Evilnurn","2007-03-19T17:35:59.687Z","One of the '90s best sets.","In my opinion, this set was one of the best sets of the 1990s in quality. First of all, the base feature is very good, and extremely useful in any kind of underwater set one wants to create after the original is dismantled. This same set of reasoning goes for the large doors.

One of my favorite parts of the set is the functionality of the conveyor belt, and innovation not often seen but so sough after by the Lego community.

The inclusion of the small yellow/blue dome and the submarine make this set a perfect addition to any Aquazone collector, and perfect for anyone who needs yellow pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2009-06-03T20:05:32.217Z","Two baseplates!?","Yes, amazingly enough. This set has two raised base plates, a rather uncommon sight. The base plates themselves are actually very useful, and can easily be rearranged for building any aquazone base. The set has four minifigures, just enough to fill this massive set, but one more wouldn't hurt. 

The set includes the following features:
- A submarine with a docking platform and storage
- A well sealed base with plenty of detailed doors and windows
- A crane
- A really cool conveyor belt to carry crystals
- A watchtower
- A refueling station compatible with most other sets.
- BIG Doors
- Plenty of details, accessories, and crystals (with containers)

The set will never fall as one of the best aquazone bases, period.
There's plenty to see, even more than pictured above (enlarge the image and see)

Pros:
- Well designed with lots of features
- Awesome crane
- Docking pad
- Loads of accessories
- Octopus
- Even the back is detailed (large window panels)
- Weather tower is cool
- Submarine
- A lifetime supply of octagons, propellers, and seaweed
- Even doors have details
- steering wheels add a nice ""pressure valve"" effect
- crane actually reaches the deposit slot

Cons:
- Needs another minifigure
- Doors swing a little too easily
- Crane is hard to operate and has only two height settings, but can be fixed with a gearbox
- Arm pieces are and will always be too breakable
- hose is too short
- could use a few more control panels

Overall, the cons are rather minor and can be fixed for pennies on the dollar, not to mention that the set is a great buy at about $45 to 488 parts, plenty of which are perfect for underwater OR space models. Also, unlike newer sets, the larger parts used here are easy to use creatively (even the doors, which make nice wings). If you don't have one and are a fan of the aquazone series, get one, I recommend it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-10T04:49:52.667Z","LEGO Aquazone (Aquanauts) - Neptune Discovery Lab Review","This set is my largest LEGO Aquazone set I have and it's also my favourite. I love the big baseplates which comes with this set. This model took me a while but it's a fun built. It's also a very sturdy set and it has no stickers which you've to worry about. This model does include a sub too. This sub has two arms which are movable. One arm has a claw which can be opened and the other one has a magnet which works really good. The windscreen is also very cool. It does open and you can see the screen there. On the top you get two headlights and an antenna which both sviwel. On the back of the sub can be opened and you can store some stuff in there. This set also comes with a compass which does really work.<br><br>The base looks very awsome. It has lot's of play features as well. We get a gas station for the sub, a tower with a translucent blue dome which lifts up and we get the main base. We get some rare door pieces which open really nice. There's also a second door in black which opens too. On the top of that building you can see a crane which can pick up the crystals onto the platform which can be moved by a LEGO Technic gear piece. All in all I can't really complain about that set. It's a must have for all LEGO fans.<br><br>All

"GBP_Chris","2011-01-31T23:32:47.387Z","Aquazone at its Finest","<p>While not the most intricately designed set, the Neptune Discovery Lab makes for a good play set. The assortment of yellow and transparent blue pieces makes for a very eye-catching color scheme that contrasts well with the blue raised baseplates. Though regularly I am not a fan of raised baseplates,I must admit the set excels in carving itself around them.</p>

<p>The submarine is the most well-built portion of the set, with many features and a stable build. I especially appreciate the arms and the magnet used to collect crystal boxes.</p>

<p>The base itself is nice, albeit very cramped. The doors are very useful pieces that I have utilized in many a MOC. The conveyor belt is a fun feature for dropping off crystals (or other small pieces if you so wish).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to admit, though, that the small tower to the right is quite lacking. While it serves its purpose as a basic lookout tower, it looks quite bland.</p>

<p>The minifigures are excellent - good printing, useful and good-looking helmet and visors, plus the additional silver knives and harpoons are definitely a pro.</p>

<p>Overall, a fun set. The abysmal after-market prices may be as much of a naysayer as its original retail price, but because I got mine for free from a friend, I can&#39;t complain much. Needless to say, if you have the opportunity to pick this set up for a decent, low price, I personally would not hesitate.</p>

"PeteM","2018-12-21T16:52:09.767Z","Top Marks For Underwater Space Base","<p>The flagship of the new Aquazone theme, this fulfilled the compulsory &lsquo;goodies base&rsquo; slot in the initial series of releases. The box (which I still have) was probably in the last hurrah for extravagant packaging that really showed off the contents &ndash; a hinged lid, illustrated with various pictures of the set and alternate builds, opened to reveal two cut-outs showing off the largest and most interesting pieces (the baseplates, the minifigs etc) under a Perspex covering.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The dominant colours of the set are yellow and blue, with black and trans orange highlight and, barring a few light grey Technic pieces and some foliage, all the pieces stick to this palette. There were no stickers as far as I recall, with all graphic designs (several of which were specific to the theme) being printed on various elements.</p>

<p>The two raised baseplates with unique &lsquo;underwater&rsquo; printing are immediately striking, as are the large door arch pieces and the doors that go into them, all of which remain unique to this set. It was also the only appearance of a 9x13 grille in yellow, while the blue octagonal canopy only appeared in one other set.</p>

<p>As far as &lsquo;firsts&rsquo; go, this being in the initial wave of the new Aquanauts theme meant it included a lot of new pieces in the inventory, most noticeably the new octagonal bricks (some with studs on the sides), the plant extension piece (which allows for taller and more colourful bushes), and chromed harpoons, knives and &lsquo;ore&rsquo; pieces. A number of those introduced in these sets were used widely outside the theme, including the propeller housing, octopus, and minifig flippers.</p>

<p>The Space theme lineage comes through in the large curved trans-blue panels, cockpits, hinged robotic arm pieces, as well as utilising the magnetic pieces that defined M-Tron a few years earlier.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigs included, relatively few for such a large set. They all came with new underwater style headgear, one of which had a special trans light blue visor, while the rest make do with standard black. Underneath were the printed faces that had by then become standard in new Lego themes - one is freckled and appears to be wearing a red sweat band (?), two with particularly smug smirks are sporting underwater sunglasses (??), and the last has some kind of comms device. They also have new flippers and can be armed with the chromed harpoon and knives mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straight forward, with the only initial difficulty being accuracy in placement of the foundations for the various elements. The rest is mainly brick stacking, with the Technic-style conveyer belt providing a bit of interest. Some of the yellow-on-yellow steps in the instructions can be a bit difficult to discern (we&rsquo;re still pre-part callout at this point!) but it&rsquo;s entirely in line with similar sets of the era.</p>

<h3>Completed Model and Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The base itself includes three smaller builds in addition to the dominating main structure &ndash; the sub docking station on the left of the set being the most insubstantial, though it does its job. On the right-hand side is what I always assumed to be the underwater equivalent of air traffic&nbsp;control &ndash; a fairly small, but robust model, an octagonal &lsquo;bubble&rsquo; of contrasting yellow and blue, built up around uneven terrain which adds visual interest. At the front in the middle is a small more industrial-looking construction where the submarine (or vehicles from other sets) an plug in to a crystal refuelling station. All of these use the new octagonal bricks for support which helps establish a new and unique visual style for the theme.</p>

<p>The main section of the base sits at the back and middle, comfortably straddling the two baseplates and primarily defined from the front by a large yellow arch and contrasting blue doors. It is enclosed by two large trans-blue curved panels at the back to create a large chamber, with a couple of hatches providing other means of entrance and exit. Sitting atop the base&nbsp;is a rotating crane which can be raised and lowered, albeit via a&nbsp;rather rudimentary technic axle system which doesn&rsquo;t offer much fidelity in vertical positioning. What appears to be some kind of processing centre complete with conveyer belt protrudes out of the right-hand side, with crystals able to be dropped off by the crane and then moved either left into the main building, or right and into a waiting trans-orange storage container. This simple function works well enough, and crystals conveyed into the building then slide down a chute and slopes where they are held back by a hinged plate attached to the large grill piece. This can be opened to release the crystals, at which point the process can be repeated!</p>

<p>The submarine is a substantial model and could even be a standalone set all by itself. Solidly built and very &lsquo;swooshable&rsquo;, it provides a huge amount of extra playability as it can go on expeditions beyond the base and have adventures separate to the refining activity of the base. With two hinged arms sporting claws on one side and a magnet on the other, it can also carry out a wide variety of functions and tasks within the base setting.</p>

<p>When all put together, the result is impressive and highly playable. The set is first and foremost a playset, with a variety of functions and moving parts on the base, and a submarine that begs to be swished around the room. It also makes a nice display piece &ndash; not in a modular building sense, but it looks impressive and engaging. The &lsquo;Space&rsquo; DNA of this new theme is obvious, and there is certainly an argument that you could swap a few of the colours out and have a fairly serviceable space base without needing to replace or change out much in design terms. The submarine (which somehow manages to appear both prototypical and unique!) and colour scheme firmly root it in the undersea world and the crystal harvesting and processing story is interesting. As with all of these kinds of sets, the play and story possibilities are expanded considerably with conflict, and it&rsquo;s a shame that it doesn&rsquo;t include even one Aquashark figure or model to provide that. That minor niggle aside, this is still one of the sets I look back on most fondly from my childhood and one I remember getting most play value from, so overall it scores top marks from me.</p>
