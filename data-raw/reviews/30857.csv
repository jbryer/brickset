Sadly, I did not buy this set and the set retired at the end of 2019. But then...</p>

<p>When I heard the set was going to be re-released, I saw this as an opportunity to buy the set of my dreams. So I bought set 92176 Saturn V and the finished model was everything I expected with detailed exterior and removable stages, with a mini Lunar Module with the moon&#39;s surface. I can easily recreate the Apollo moon mission with this model, as it included everything this set has to show how the Apollo moon missions worked. The model comes with display stands so that the rocket can be displayed horizontally and with its stages separately, so that the model can fit on a shelf. I separated the rocket&#39;s stages with excitement, and that was when the trouble came...</p>

<p>The connection point between the first stage and second stage of the rocket is considerably strong since it is connected with 8 clips surrounding the inner part of the stage evenly spaced in 4 sections. However, the connection point between the second and third stage of the model is only connected with 4 clips paired facing against each other, which means that the third stage might have the tendency to swing a little if you are not careful. Now if you want to recreate the real life separating of the stages in the correct order, I suggest you do it vertically and very gently. DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT swing the two stages apart while the third stage is connected. If you are not careful, the third stage might un-clip by itself and fall onto the floor. This has happened to me...twice.</p>

<p>The first time it happened, the white 2x2 round, slope&nbsp;piece&nbsp;on the top got dented. Not to worry, I was able to replace that part. But the second time it happened, the stage landed nozzle first, bending the rod connecting the exhaust to the rocket stage body, which also damaged 3 other pieces in the process. It was a nightmare, but I was able to replace the parts.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this set is a faithful replica of the Saturn V and it is in my opinion the best Lego Ideas set ever released. The details are spot on, and the recreation of the moon landing is fully possible with this set. One bit of caution is to be careful with separating the stages of the rocket or you might experience the same trouble I did. Other than that, with careful play, this is a set that is useful for aerospace education and making fun dioramas out of.</p>
