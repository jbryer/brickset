"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-04T17:55:39Z","Huge,but...","I like this set,but it has some simplified parts,so I only give it a 8/10.I like the room in this cool model.The cockpit for example has two stingrays standing in it and about 5 would fit in easily.But the cockpit lacks details,like most other sets of the 1998 Aquazone line..The other big room in that sub is some kind of a lab,which features nice lamps,computer panels and a Chrystal box.There are even two little cargo areas and it's really scary for Hydronauts,because of the huge size. And it seems to be overpriced for only around 400pcs,but I got it at the half price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-22T19:11:56Z","This is a great set.","It's the only stingray set I don't have but I've seen the instructions and really like it. A bit smaller on the inside than I'd like but it's really good overall. See even in '98 LEGO could make LEGO. The Hydronaut base, the big Insectoid set (say what you want that was cool), the Ninja series (the best series for traps  and almost as good as castle overall), the start of the Adventurers series. That was in my opinion LEGO's last really good year even though next year had Star Wars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-07T22:01:36Z","The BEST set I own!!!! (I own a lot)","This set is splinded! It has two deachable scout scooters which are very fun and good for spy missions.  The cocpit can fit four stingrays (five if it had to) and it has two cool control panels.  The &quot;lab&quot; in the back is cool (it has lots of detail) too accept for lack of space, but it can still hold three stingrays (not comfortably).  It has room enough for storage of three crystals.  I really like the little &quot;pinchy claws&quot; as I call them, they are good for picking up crystals and pinching enemies.  this set is great and well worth the price, get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-20T13:46:06Z","Wait!  I forgot some things in my last reveiw!","Wait!  Wait! I forgot to mention some things in my last review: The octopus is so funny, I put the red bush on his head and pretend it is his hair!  Also, I discovered that you can jam cram a sixth stingray in the cocpit!  Get it, get it, get it!! I was worth every single little tiny penny of the sixty U.S. dollars I paid for it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

However... the execution is a little lackluster. No, it's not bad, but it's not great. There are a lot of gaps, and the tiling is not very sleek. The surface of what should have been a smooth, eerily sleek model is decorated with accessories, almost at random. The design works, from a basically, but it should have been better. I don't dislike it, though, and it's probably the best set out of the Aquazone line.

PROS:

- Awesome parts and figs

- One of LEGO's more creative designs

- Huge but sturdy

- Cool fish accessories 

- Sweet double-cockpit

CONS:

- Gappy design

- Clashing color scheme 

- Just isn't as sleek as it should be


Great set, highly recommended if you don't mind gappy designs. 

- Not as sleek as it should have been",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T16:34:52.467Z","What has 2 eyes, 1 tail, and scares away other minifigures?","Well if you said this (or my dog...) you're right!
This MASSIVE set, which looks bigger in person, has four minifigures and plenty of accesories. 

Though it only has 2 crystals ic can hold 3! The two quarter panels in the fron lift up to reveal the controls, and the sliding magnetic doors in back reveal the crew and  a lab of sorts. There are two pods similar to the recon ray set, and there are also two grabber claws attached to pneumatic hoses (though for no reason, remove them if you choose) and a spare grabber. There are also four harpoons, one for each figure. quite a few of the parts are unique (only appear in this set!) and the swinging tail is awesome. The compartment in the back with the hinged transparent neon green car roof holds a crystal in it, and when up can provide a cool display pose for a diver yanking it open. 

The set has some graet parts for many uses, especially the dark gray &quot;shuttle plates&quot; (named for their shuttle-like shape) underneath. A great buy if at a decent price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
