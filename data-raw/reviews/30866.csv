<p>Originally called the Batplane, the Batwing was created by the group of artists led by Julian Caldow, conceptual designer, Greg Morgan&nbsp;and&nbsp;the late Anton Furst, production designer,&nbsp;on <em>Batman&nbsp;</em>directed by Tim Burton. It is important to remember that Mr. Furst did win the Academy Award in the Art Direction category&nbsp;following the year of the film release.&nbsp;If the Batmobile is perhaps the most legendary gadget used by the Caped Crusader, cemented to legendary status thanks to its appearance in 1966 in the Adam West series or in 1989 in <em>Batman</em>&nbsp;only to be revived in a contemporary style in 2005 in <em>Batman Begins</em>, we have seen the Dark Knight using all kinds of vehicles from motorcycles (Animated Series), boats (<em>Batman Returns</em>), copters (<em>Batman 1966</em>)&nbsp;and tanks (<em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>). Perhaps the most famous is obviously&nbsp;the Batwing from the 1989 film.&nbsp;Reintroduced in <em>Batman Forever</em> in 1995 to match the different aesthetic from the production designer Barbara Ling and eventually revived in 2012 with The Bat from Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>,&nbsp;the 1989 Batwing (or the Keatonwing or Burtonwing) had that one particular detail that made it stand out: its shape matches what we usually call the Bat-symbol.</p>

<p>With 2019&#39;s masterpiece that was the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76139-1/1989-Batmobile"">76139&nbsp;1989 Batmobile</a>, LEGO decided not to rest and went ahead with the release of a fourth large-scale vehicle from the Batman comics/film series. After the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7784-1/The-Batmobile-Ultimate-Collectors-Edition"">7784 The&nbsp;Batmobile: Ultimate Collector&#39;s Edition</a> from 2007, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76023-1/The-Tumbler"">76023&nbsp;The Tumbler</a> from 2014 and, more recently, the 1989 Batmobile, we finally get a different mode of transformation. This time, it&#39;s like to fly like a bat! Thanks to LEGO, specifically the DC/Batman team, we now have the <strong>76161&nbsp;1989 Batwing</strong>!</p>

<p>The shape of the Batwing will have a massive influence in the creation of other symbols on the armored suit or the signal itself to the point of being the influence for the logo of the film. At a precise moment in the film, Batman will go up in the sky and, in a strike of genius in visual effects, the Batwing appears in front of the moon making its shape known to the audience&nbsp;only to fly down one last time to attack the Joker. Batman will be partially successful in stopping the assault by the Joker&#39;s gang with a grip system that will hold the Smylex gas balloons and pull them away from Gotham City.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite being equipped with missile launchers, front cannons&nbsp;and side-mounted miniguns to take down the true terror of Gotham City, the Batwing will be shot down by the Joker. The ridiculous long-barrel revolver will be just enough to damage the vehicle leading to its crash into the cathedral&#39;s stairs leading to the eventual climax in the belfry. Regardless of the fact that the vehicle has been destroyed in the film, toys and model kits based on the Batwing have been created much like the Batmobile of its time. LEGO finally joins in yet there&#39;s a question: does it hold up to the standards established by Burton, Furst and the masterpiece of 2019&#39;s rendition of the 1989 Batmobile?</p>

<h3>Before the construction...</h3>

<p>Thankfully, the box came in excellent condition from LEGO Canada as I did order it on release day (VIP). The box itself is much higher than the one used for the Batmobile, it is however thicker and doesn&#39;t contain an extra white box for the early bags as seen in the Batmobile set or most products for the 16+/18+ line-up. Therefore, the instructions book was unfortunately not as protected by comparison. With bags separated in 13 sections, it is indeed aa deeply-involved build. While the coverart isn&#39;t as striking as the Batmobile&#39;s since it used a picture of the actual&nbsp;prop, the Batwing does replicate its &quot;fly over the moon&quot; moment from the film which is an interesting and logical choice from the marketing team.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Something went missing...</h3>

<p>Oh, LEGO... This is the second time in two major releases that I find myself with a MISSING piece. While I did have the piece in my collection thanks to the extras, I can confirm that a dark stone grey&nbsp;round brick wasn&#39;t in Bag 12 in order to finish one of the miniguns. To me, it is indeed disappointing to pay a premium, expecting a complete package, only to have a missing piece or one that isn&#39;t part of the inventory. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on regarding LEGO&#39;s quality control, but adjustments need to be made as we approach Holiday Season in a pandemic situation.</p>

<h3>The instructions book</h3>

<p>While not as detailed or complex as the kit before it, the 1989 Batwing&#39;s instructions book does feature interesting comparisons between the prop and the actual set. It even recreates the &quot;fly over the moon&quot; shot with the set itself in the early pages which is a beautiful homage to the special effects artists.&nbsp;This is no surprise to me that&nbsp;Adam Grabowski did work on this set as he&#39;s been the lead designer for The Tumbler and contributed to the 1989 Batmobile. As my third set from this designer, I&#39;m happy&nbsp;by Adam&#39;s dedication to the Batman franchise and I can only hope that his next design will be as good if not better. I wish we did have some words from Ioana Popescu outside from the video of the 1989 Batmobile so I appreciate that she has some commentary on the printing, minifigure and sticker design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Adam and Ioana are credited, I do salute anybody who has contributed to the creation of this set. I&#39;m also happy that,&nbsp;in the designer video,&nbsp;Adam did talk about the video for the 1989 Batmobile: the shadow of the Batwing was featured. In other words, the 1989 Batwing was in the design process for a while, and we should have expected it to be released at some point.</p>

<h3>The construction</h3>

<p>Six hours is what it took for me to complete the set and it is a challenge once you begin to lack some space and need to place some stuff underneath. Since the Batwing has a lot of details, you can expect things to be dropped or fall apart. A sweet easter egg can be found during the construction which is excellent and lovely to be honest. Installing the blades that compose the edges of each wing will be the trickiest part due to the use of rubber bands yet it holds up extremely well. The sturdiness of the build is amplified with the usual Technic frames.</p>

<p>The one thing I can appreciate is that it doesn&#39;t start as an entirely symmetrical set. However, it does become fully symmetrical much like the Batmobile and the Tumbler (except for the steering wheel and the control stick respectively). In fact, even the control commands for the Batwing are asymmetrical as they&#39;re supposed to. You can indeed a slow burn when it comes to the process because it is going to be repetitive. The way they managed to capture the shape thanks to the different angles is to be commended.</p>

<h3>The complete model</h3>

<p>Okay! While I did expect the set to be enormous, I honestly underestimated the sheer size of the final product. In fact, the picture on the front of the box might give us a small idea, close enough to the actual size yet is slightly smaller. In other words,&nbsp;yes:&nbsp;the 1989 Batwing from LEGO is gigantic and will eventually take a lot of space since the set itself is bigger than its box. Seeing it in person and admiring the finer details is something else.&nbsp;If <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76120-1/Batwing-and-The-Riddler-Heist"">76120: Batwing and The Riddler&nbsp;Heist</a>&nbsp;almost took direct inspiration from the 1989 vehicle as a playset for kids, then you&#39;re in for a treat once you see the direct-to-consumer full-scale product.</p>

<p>One of my favorite sections happen to be the fins underneath the vehicle. If presented on the stand, you can adjust the fins to fully replicate the Batwing&#39;s original angles. This is a very awesome detail that is often missed from direct-to-consumer toys as the underside isn&#39;t shown as often as the&nbsp;rest of the craft in the film. Placing the stickers was a challenge due to how precise some of them have to be. However, two of them include small nods to the 1989 film which is appreciated.</p>

<p>Obviously, the shape of the Batwing, more specifically the contour, is replicated to an extremely awesome approximation given the restrictions of how squarish the LEGO bricks are. If you happen to hold the set vertically over a light, you can feel like you&#39;re replicating the Bat-signal in real time. The movable fins on the frontside shouldn&#39;t really be moving as they&#39;re much like the Batmobile&#39;s.&nbsp;There&#39;s indeed a mistake with the canopy as the seat should be a little more forward and the backside is a little more covered with the body of the vehicle. I can understand since they wanted to include the function of hanging the set on a wall with a screw which is an interesting design choice for display. It is that sturdy that you can swoosh it a little although I would not recommend letting a young kid to take the set for playing.</p>

<p>Something I&#39;m not a fan of is the lack of options to not showcase the weaponry. I know the miniguns in the film have six barrels, yet I think they would have been too large if the six barrels had been the option. The miniguns as well as the flaps are indeed the wrong colors yet I do believe a choice was intentionally made to fully distinct the various details of the vehicle. It also follows the same tradition of the 1989 Batmobile with almost realistically-inspired weaponry which isn&#39;t usual for LEGO as they do try to avoid realism.</p>

<p>The Batwing stand is pretty standard yet should have included different options for the info plaque. You can choose the Batwing to fly up or dive, the latter being ideal due to the weaponry. The minifig is 85% the same as the one used in the 1989 Batmobile set with the Cathedral&#39;s belfry edge featuring grotesques. I say 85% as two&nbsp;of the pieces for each grotesque are different yet serve the same purpose as the ones on the original model.</p>

<h3>And the minifigs?</h3>

<p><em>&quot;Excuse me. Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?&quot;</em></p>

<p>I did comment on the original 1989 Batman/Bruce Wayne (played by Michael Keaton) minifigure in <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/55677"">my personal review</a> of the 1989 Batmobile. It&#39;s still incredible although I do believe they changed the colorprint for the symbol.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The pen is truly mightier than the sword.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Mime Joker is an interesting take on the character in LEGO form since he always has the chance to stand out with bright colors such as purple, red and green&nbsp;and a nice big smile on his face. Much like his standard purple suit version, the Joker is wonderful here with a lot of printed details from the legs to the torso pieces. It does capture the theatrical aspect of the character so well.</p>

<p>The unsettling faceprint matches with the already unsettling look from the film with the small portion of red over the lips as well as the rest being black and white which is a radical tone shift since Joker is generally colorful.&nbsp;The lack of a full smile adds up to the uniqueness of the minifigure and some&nbsp;wrinkles match one-to-one with the original Joker design from the 1989 Batmobile set.</p>

<p>He does hold a quill pen which is used to end Vinnie Ricorso&#39;s life before delivering&nbsp;that one famous line. If you&#39;re a fan of Jack Nicholson&#39;s Joker, you&#39;ll definitely appreciate this extra rendition of the Clown Prince of Crime. The only small mistake I could notice was the lack of white polka dots on the large bow tie. A lot of people would mistake this Joker rendition with Oswald Cobblepot aka the Penguin. However, the last figure does clear things up regarding Joker.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Gentlemen, let&#39;s broaden our minds! Lawrence!&quot;</em></p>

<p>The questionable presence of Lawrence, aka Boombox Goon/Goon and his Tune&nbsp;played by George Lane Cooper, is brought up because Bob, played by Tracey Walter,&nbsp;is the most known Joker gang member in the film and is featured in almost every scene with the antagonist. Bob was the Number One Guy for Joker/Jack Napier and the actor is a close friend of Jack Nicholson, so I imagine licensing was in question. However, Lawrence has the privilege to be one of three members of the Joker&#39;s gang to be named by the antagonist. So let&#39;s give Lawrence a chance and review his LEGO form.</p>

<p>Lawrence&#39;s first apparition was during Joker&#39;s takeover of Boss Carl Grissom&#39;s council of crime lords yet was a central figure in the Flugelheim Museum where he ruins some pictures while holding the ghetto blaster&nbsp;playing <em>Partyman</em> by the late singer Prince. He&#39;s also in the apartment scene with Bob which means that he might have a slightly higher place in the gang&#39;s hierarchy or it was planned, once again, to bring music in the hen house.</p>

<p>His overall print details are wonderful with the printed arm with the Joker cards (based on the backcover of <em>The Killing Joke</em>, this time being a jester, regardless of the fact that Lawrence only has one Joker card on his sleeve instead of three yet Bob did have five cards, a full hand, on his&nbsp;leather coat) and the Joker&#39;s logo on the front. The ever-so majestic handlebar mustache is reproduced to fully match his stoic yet&nbsp;severe facial expression&nbsp;including the glasses.</p>

<p>The neck collar featured a diverse number of dice sides, yet LEGO went ahead to feature two of them on the torso piece. Number Four is indeed on both the character and the minifig yet Number Two was used instead of One; Six and Three are on&nbsp;the upper part of the dice sides on the original costume. He obviously has the boombox, yet it would have been better if it was in black instead of the light grey. A mistake I did notice&nbsp;was the smile of Joker&#39;s head on the jacket being slightly misaligned and that&#39;s me being nitpicky with the details. Despite not being Bob, Lawrence&#39;s rendition in LEGO form is incredible and should be judged as a replica of the character instead of being the one to be expected.</p>

<h3>Price per piece and licence</h3>

<p>Much like the 1989 Batmobile, its brother of Gotham&#39;&nbsp;sky has a highly-respectable price per piece ratio. Knowing it contains a lot of large elements from frames to the pieces making the canopy, the value for the set is as good as it was for the sister of Gotham&#39;s roads. The overall size of the vehicle also helps in judging the value. Obviously, its licence factor could have been the one regarding a much higher estimated price, yet that wasn&#39;t the case.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The 1989 Batwing, at $200 USD or $260 CAD, is an excellent product with great value and the size of the final build will have you amazed. While the minifigures are a nice addition, they shouldn&#39;t influence your purchase because they&#39;re not part of the core building experience. If you own the 1989 Batmobile, I do believe you&#39;ve already considered the purchase or have the set in your room at the moment. Together, they make an incredible presence as they scale almost perfectly with each other.&nbsp;If you were to make a choice between the Batmobile or the Batwing, it is obvious that the Batmobile is a better choice as it is featured in two films, playable in video games adaptations like Batman: Arkham Knight as downloadable content&nbsp;and exposed in various conventions.</p>

<p>As a Batman fan and despite some mistakes regarding the canopy and how severe the stickers pl&nbsp;I&#39;m satisfied with the final build and the minifigures look great. I highly respect the work that has been done by the designers and the teams involved in its production.</p>

"Havoc","2020-11-02T22:55:12.8Z","Redemption? Kind of...","<p>After a disappointment that was Batmobile to me I was hoping that Batwing would do better. And it did.</p>

<p>But better still doesn&#39;t mean good. Let&#39;s take a look.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Minifigs are good, Batman is a must, especially that not everyone will have both Batmobile and Batwing. Joker in his clown/mime suit is really good. Finally something different than purple suit and green hair. Lawrence is also good and instantly recognizable but as it was said in other reviews I was surprised that they used Lawrence instead of Bob, Joker&#39;s right hand and number one guy. Well...Bob...gun. And Bob is gone.</p>

<p><strong>Instruction</strong></p>

<p>Lego is trying to be &#39;eco&#39; and makes instruction that is over 350 pages long when it could easily be at least 100 pages shorter. Big instruction is not epic when it doesn&#39;t need to be. This set is 18+, not for kids that need to have 1 piece per page instruction. Adults can handle something more difficult. There is list of pieces needed for every step so we could just try to look on the picture and find where they need to be attached. A little challenge during building is what lego is all about I think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I still think that lepin was&nbsp;making better instructions. Although not on purpose but to save money, but still they made&nbsp;them shorter. Lego, learn from them.</p>

<p><strong>Set</strong></p>

<p>This is a really weird case. There is information in the instruction that designers had blueprints and went all out to recreate the distinctive features of Batwing. Next to that there are pictures of &#39;real&#39; Batwing and lego model for comparison. And they differ a lot...</p>

<p>But let&#39;s take a closer look and specify what is wrong and what is right.</p>

<p>It hurts my eyes to see DBG and LBG pieces everywhere. I assume they are there just for variety because in original they are just a bit lighter than pitch black. They didn&#39;t need to be so distinctive.</p>

<p>Front lights on the wings are at a weird angle, I know it&#39;s hard to make them when wings are made with that kind of technique but still it looks weird.</p>

<p>No cutters in front.</p>

<p>Miniguns are not deployable and they are attached on lbg hinges because...reasons. Less functions and more colours...yay!</p>

<p>Shape of front part of wings is really bad. What is up with this &#39;step&#39; between slopes. Looks terrible.</p>

<p>There are no &#39;fins&#39; on the back of wings.</p>

<p>Less studs would look better in my opinion but that&#39;s just my preference.</p>

<p>Back section in the middle looks bad as it&#39;s not even close to the slick look of the original. Even with the use of this big curved element.</p>

<p>Colours, colours, colours. Why use lbg plate just underneath black tile. We all know that pieces don&#39;t cover each other perfectly and this colour will be visible but no...lbg is probably cheaper so let&#39;s use it. Not to mention that hinges responsible for edges of wings are in dbg...cheaper, or they just had a surplus of those?</p>

<p>Now for some good things.</p>

<p>Wings are&nbsp;built very well and those curved edges look real good. Overall shape is pretty good.</p>

<p>Main &#39;fins&#39; and underside add-ons are very good.</p>

<p>Set as a whole is very robust, looks and feels solid.</p>

<p>And now for the final part of build that is unfortunately the biggest disappointment - cockpit and windscreen.</p>

<p>Batman&#39;s seat is so weird. He would need 2-meter hands to operate Batwing. However I really like the looks of rudder and throttle sticks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windscreen is the biggest disappointment in the whole set.</p>

<p>There is a misleading photo where it looks like it&#39;s openable and is on some kind of hinge.</p>

<p>Turns out it&#39;s just loose and laying on the model, not even attached to at least 2 symbolic studs to stay in its place. It&#39;s especially weird as model have option to be wall mounted. When you hang it on the wall it takes just a little bump for windscreen to fall off. This is a really lazy design especially after perfectly made opening windscreen in Batmobile. Also windscreen is way too long compared to original. Dedicated piece for it would be great but those transparent elements do just fine in my opinion.</p>

<p>Display stand is solid and gives two options for display which is appreciated.</p>

<p>To sum up - set is not bad and worth it&#39;s price. Many of its flaws can be easily adjusted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a very good source of parts.</p>
