"Ashton_Giant","2020-11-25T22:33:47.287Z","Not an Old Curiosity ! ","<p>This set was a free gift with a &pound;150 spend at Lego.com in November 2020.</p>

<p>I enjoyed building this set which took just under 1 hour at a leisurely pace.&nbsp;<br />
There are a few elements I haven&#39;t seen before like the lantern and the decorative &#39;stone work&#39; on the fireplace which also hold the candles.</p>

<p>This set also has a &#39;secret&#39; drawer which could be used to store spare bits in or&nbsp;for a few sweets for a child (or a folded up cheque !) for&nbsp;Christmas Day.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no downsides to this set !&nbsp;<br />
The outside of the build is as visually pleasing as the inside and with THREE figures, this is a brilliant set especially as it cost nothing to own !&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would love to see more sets like this one, being a bibliophile, they would be the perfect gift for me !&nbsp;</p>

It&#39;s a good meaty build with lots of nice details, clever techniques, and 3 excellent minifigures. It took maybe an hour or two but I like to go slow.&nbsp;There are quite a few stickers, though I can&#39;t begrudge lego for not wanting to screen-print for a freebie and they do look good. Packing in an interior, an outside area, three characters AND the book with a little drawer into something this compact is just fantastic. I would love to see these cozy book-themed builds become a theme</p>

"aztecwarrior","2020-12-28T20:22:26.847Z","Fantasy & Literature (F&L) Review: The Most Wonderful Set of the Year!","<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Is The First Fantasy &amp; Literature Review!</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes! And the&nbsp;</strong>bedpost&nbsp;was his own, the bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own, to make amends in!&quot; This really is one of the best lego sets there has ever been! Being released as a GWP, you probably can&#39;t get it in that way anymore, but it is only about 40-50 dollars on ebay in brand new condition. If it had been sold as an ordinary set, then it would have been $23.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The set itself is very cool. It features poor Bob Cratchets shabby house in London and a snowy yard on top of the beautifully decorated maroon red book. In the yard is a lamppost, a small little fir tree, and a snow covered decorated fence with a little path way leading to what I suppose as the door to the house although, if it is a door, it doesn&#39;t open, unfortunately.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside Cratchets hous are tattered walls, using stickers. In the corner stands a little happy Christmas Tree, all that Cratchets can afford. There is then the fireplace, which is decorated with a wreath&nbsp;of berries, and on the protruding decorative curves that make the mantel&nbsp;are two fresh candles alight, lighting the dinginess&nbsp;of the little home. The fireplace is lit also, but the flame is no bigger than that which burns on the candles. Above the wreath and on the chimney is a picture (using a sticker,&nbsp;again) of a quaint, tiny red cottage by the mountains*. The floor of the hose is made old rickety wood planks (once again, using stickers), and there are three 2x2 tiles with studs to display the minifigures on.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The outside of the hose has a chimney stack topped with snow and a snowy shingled roof with fading colors at the back. The book you build the scene on is incredibleley authentic looking with the grilled bricks used as the book pages and the 1x4 curved tiles for the binding. Golden&nbsp;patterns of snowflakes and the title &#39;A Christmas Carol&#39;, and Charles Dickens&#39;&nbsp;name in the middle of the binding (still using stickers) make for a buetifull and amazing build on your shelf with plenty of places to pose the minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes! The minifigures which I keep mentioning so often might just be the best part of the whole set. There is&nbsp;Tiny Tim, with a double face, one side happy and the other dirty and sad, and he wears a red scarf around a basic but realistic torso.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then Bob Cratchets, Tim&#39;s father, who&#39;s hair piece in brown is quite rare, and with a green torso that is very detailed and gives you a feeling&nbsp;of London&nbsp;in the 1800&#39;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, there is old Scrooge, coming to pay Cratchets his increased sallery! His hat is unlike the ordinary top hat and is much taller, more detailed, and has a buckle around the bottom of it. His face is very detailed,&nbsp;and even without a nose the spectacles make up for where it would be and his face is still recognizable. His torso represents&nbsp;a typacle long tailed coat that most businessmen wore in London in those days.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So, even though I would rather have printed pieces and not stickers (which can easily get wrinkled and don&#39;t look as good) and would rather have a more distinguishable door to the Cratchets house, to&nbsp;conclude the whole set, I will say this;&nbsp;It is one of a few, very few, of the best, most detailed, and Inredible sets that Lego has made in all of its existence.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be extremely awesome if there were a whole theme of sets in this style of scenes from the most classic pieces of Literature and poetry on brickbuilt book vignettes, such as The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, The Invisible Man, Frankenstein, and much more,</p>

<p>*( I wonder if the picture hints at a future lego set, because it seems a bit random and not relevant to Scrooge&#39;s story, and also because the Creator Expert Colloseum set was hinted at in a printed tile in set 10271: Fiat 500, but I could be wrong)</p>
