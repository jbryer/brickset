As mentioned, lots of pieces, and those large trans-green quarter domes and the rounded corridor pieces would be ideal for a SP2 base. The baseplate is good for Space, and making a mountain (I made one for my Western bandits out of it.) Most of the yellow octagonal pieces are useless, except for Aquazone, or a new Space theme featuring a lot of yellow (Too much for Blacktron, and not the right shape or style for that either.) Why weren't any clams, starfish, or crabs included in these or the Divers sets. Maybe they didn't exist yet, but they could have been considered and made earlier. On the Aquanaut topic, why didn't TLC make a giant octopus ship, like that giant stingrays one, except of course, shaped like an octopus, with little scooters built on octopuses that come out underneath. That might be cruel, but it would be cool. I actually have a very fragile something I made up like that. The subtheme might have been expanded more so that two giant things, it and the Neptune base, wasn't too much for one subtheme. About that sub... Ummmm... no comment! By the way (not really, but that's okay), if any one in the U.S. is wondering when the catalog will come finally, it is July 7 to 10 according to a helpful catalog representitive who resently saw a copy, and is making an estimate on the time of arrival.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-29T22:15:46Z","Great","...sure it's not as good as the Aquazone base but that was untouchable. I agree with Lord Penguin. This would be great for a SP2 base (too bad TLC never made one). The big letdown about this set is the ship it's pretty cool but it's so fragile. Good idea about the octopus sub too. I wish Aquazone lasted longer...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-22T20:58:27.523Z","Another nice Aquazone base","Lego Space might have gone downhill in the late nineties, but Aquazone held its head up high right until its last year.  This set contains a base which is both nice-looking and functional.  The only problem I had was with the back end of the submarine.  It's far too flimsy, and no matter what I did the pieces just refused to stay in place.  Still, a must-buy if you're a fan of sci-fi Lego.

"jacobiscool4","2009-12-29T14:11:29.92Z","not good","first of all it should have come with a crystal collector sub as well as the prison one. second of all it should have more room in that cramped little lab. third of all that little string the aquashark vehicle is towing comes off all the time.
pros:
octopus,shark and stingray
collapsible prison door
portable prison cadge can be put on some sort of conveyor belt
cons:
conveyor does not lead to prison
no place to put crystals in sub
overall 5/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
