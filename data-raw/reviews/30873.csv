<p>The B-model on the other hand is really cool in both looks and overall stability. It&#39;s the Titanium Dragon from #30547 but bigger and more modern looking. Nearly all parts are used in both builds. And as always you as a buyer are welcomed to make changes or additions to it, so it fits to your needs or other small polybag dragons you might have. Looking at you #30428!</p>

<p>First off, I&#39;m weird, I like the mini mechs. I like the big ones, to, but since I also build to give props to my roleplaying group, they can be big biped. Or golems. This is going to be a golem. It is a little wobbly, but nothing tinkering up a base won&#39;t fix for my purposes but it is ugly to display. It is stable enough for play, though, and there might be a mod with those feet that won&#39;t be quite so ugly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I really got it for the alternate build. It is very much like the&nbsp;30547 White Dragon from a few years back. This critter looks to be related and is a very similar design. Considering that 30547 is my favorite polybag of all time, and one of my favorite models of the past ten years, that is good praise. The bare clip as the forepaw is a little bit of a let down after the last such dragon, but I can fix that. The tail has more articulation, and the head is a little more detailed, so in balance it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the price, nice little builds. And for the price, worth getting at least two, so you can display both.&nbsp;And I&#39;ll be getting a third. For 30547, I built four variant ones in red, green, yellow and blue. I&#39;m going to be building a black one of these. Yes, Voltron temple dogs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I had to pick a criticism is the lack of a minifigure. But given that Lego wants this to be a mech, not a dragon, I suppose that makes sense.&nbsp;</p>
