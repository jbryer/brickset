With 85 pieces it presents as many details as you can pack into it with that piece count limitation. It was a May The Fourth gift-with-purchase. And after that sometimes could be found sold for 3,99 Euros in some stores.</p>

<p>The only minor issue I have with this set, is the cockpit, which in my opinion shouldn&acute;t be as rounded off, but instead should have a more sharp and angular shape.</p>

<p>Overall I love this set and it defenetly will be a fine addition to any Lego Star Wars collector out there.</p>
