Rather than blank faces and no limbs, suddenly the smallest Lego figures actually had poseablity and personality, which felt like a quantum leap at the time.

I have knocked a point off for the fireman not being able to fit into his vehicle (which is easily fixed by taking off the roof and adding a steering wheel) and also for the placement of the stickers (I don't mind stickers, but putting them across several bricks limits your ability to take a set apart and build something else which is the whole point of Lego!) Other than that this is a perfect little set with enough basic pieces to make a surprising number of models. I have always thought the best sets Lego have produced are the little pocket-money priced ones with a figure or two and this is a classic example.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
