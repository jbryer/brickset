"Slobrojoe","2020-10-23T16:00:14.61Z","Issue 72- The Mandalorian ","<p>Blocks Magazine&nbsp;has been going on for over 5 years now, bringing quality LEGO information and reviews&nbsp;to collectors. Since Brickset has recently added them to the database, I thought that I&#39;d review the ones I&nbsp;get. In this review, I will cover what you get in the magazine, whether it is worth the money and some bits and bobs in between.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3>

<p>One of the main staples found in Blocks Magazines are the reviews, appearing in every issue. Every issue is based around a particular set, whether that is 71040 or 10273. I&#39;m sure you can guess what this month&#39;s is from the cover.</p>

<ul>
	<li>75292: The Razorcr... No sorry;The Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Transport. The review spans only 2 pages and has 7 photos, which doesn&#39;t seem a lot seeing as it is the star set this issue.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>75280: 501st Legion Clone Troopers. Also known as the 501st battlepack, the review takes up one page and focuses on the collectability&nbsp;of it, being double the price, but also the play functions.</li>
	<li>75281: Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor. The review is half a page and the review focuses on the small changes from the last one and the inflated price tag.</li>
	<li>75283: Armoured Assault Tank. Also known as the AAT, this review shares a page with the above and highlights the high price tag, the good minifigs and the oversized tank.</li>
	<li>75284: Knights of Ren Transport Ship. Also known as the Night Buzzard, the review takes up 1 page and shows the ugly underside and the amazingly detailed top, as well as the 2 unique minifigures.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>75286: General Greivous&#39;s Starfighter. It takes up 1 page and shows the beautiful aesthetics, the very heavy price point and a re-used, inaccurate minifigure.</li>
	<li>75293: Resistance I-TS Transport. Takes up 2 pages, which is the same as the Razorcrest (it&#39;s shorter to write and catchy). Focuses on reminisce of the U-wing and how it is a pretty original set from Galaxy&#39;s Edge. Some ugly technic bits showing though, and not a great minifig selection.</li>
	<li>75288: AT-AT. Also known as the All Terrain Attack Transport, this review spans 2 pages and is the highest rated Star Wars set this wave. A bit pricey, but an incredible model.</li>
	<li>76151: Venomasaurus Ambush. One of the more abstract Marvel sets, this review takes 1 page and features some stellar minifigs.</li>
	<li>76157: Wonder Woman VS Cheetah. The second highest rating this issue, it is across one page, focusing on minifigures, build and packaging.</li>
	<li>21323: Grand Piano. Spanning 4 pages, the review shows scaling compared to a real grand piano and how it works.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Recurring articles</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Recently, BrickWife was dropped for a new challenge called the &ldquo;Rebuild Challenge&rdquo; where a member of the Blocks team chooses a set to make into something else in a 15&nbsp;minute time limit. This issue&#39;s Rebuild Challenge is of 40377: Donald Duck, which makes for an..... interesting challenge.</li>
	<li>A &#39;Blockstalgia&#39; chapter has been added where the team looks at a certain theme, this issue&#39;s being Divers from 1997. This chapter includes some memories in Re-Wind, Re-Views of 6555: Sea Hunter, 6442: Sting Ray Explorer and 6441: Deep Sea Refuge and finally Re-Build, where they rebuild the sea floor from 6559: Deep Sea Bounty.</li>
	<li>We have &#39;Month in MOCs&#39; where the team picks out the best MOCs across social media. This month&#39;s includes a Ferrari, a visit to the Wild West, a microscale Republic Dropship and a garden house. Blocks interview Ivan Guerrero, the creator of Avatar: The Illuminated World of Pandora, which has been submitted to LEGO IDEAS and is very close to reaching 10,000 supporters. There is also an interview with Roger Schembri, who is the designer behind the MOC of The Room which is currently on LEGO IDEAS.</li>
	<li>MOD SQUAD shows us how to build a better LEGO Star Wars Bantha and The Child&#39;s bassinet as well as a Blurrg, of which the latter two are from The Mandalorian</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a lot more to discover in this issue like talking with members of the real life 501st Legion and all about IsraeLUG. It costs &pound;5.49 in the UK and can be found in some Newsagents and I have found it in WHSmiths. Elsewhere in the world, especially the Americas, it can be expensive and very hard to find, so it might be worth subscribing to get your moneys worth and to never miss out on an issue.</p>

<p>Overall, there is a lot of content for your money, especially in the UK, but you might want certain issues, seeing as this one is mainly Star Wars and a bit of Marvel, but I would recommend it to all LEGO fans but specifically TFOLs and AFOLs because it might be too advanced for kids to understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I&nbsp;hope you support Blocks, buy the issues, merchandise and just show your support to keep an invaluable source of information and look out for my next reviews.</p>
