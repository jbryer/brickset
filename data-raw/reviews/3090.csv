Sure, Redbeard &amp; the skeleton are all too common--but it's still a nice set. Good selection of accessories overall (accessories is a good thing).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The set includes also two minifigures of two pirates and also a skeleton and two &quot;conquerors&quot;, like the spanish or portuguese soldiers from the 1500's years. One of the pirates minifigures included is a captain, also included with some others, and have like all the other of this set, a good design and simple too, in a classic lego style. Each minifigure have their printed differences, and some itens like the hats, helms and halmets, or the swords, guns and the captain's wood leg. The set have also a minifigure of a skeleton like some other lego skeletons and a treasure chest. Altough this have no building except for the minifigures and treasure, this small is more to increase a collection of the pirates theme, a minifigure pack with some minifigures rare now, a awesome little set that was cheap. Unfortunately, the pirates theme end near 1997.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
