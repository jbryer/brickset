<p>Scrooge himself is a standard BrickHeadz design.&nbsp;&nbsp;He comes with his blue jacket with red highlights, and a printed brick on the front.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a neat top hat and includes a beak and some additional tiles and slopes to represent his feathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and his has tiles to stand in as his glasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I almost made a Scrooge BrickHeadz as a convention trophy a few years ago but instead opted for Darkwing Duck.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how long before he appears as a BrickHeadz&hellip;?)&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more unusual bits is the wedge plates used as his flipper duck feet, which seems a bit awkward to me, like his legs are sprawling out in an odd direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I guess they&rsquo;ve used it for the other duck BrickHeadz before, so might as well keep it consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrooge has two tiles to showcase his shoes, making it a bit different.</p>

<p>The triplets are all the exact same designs but with recolors&hellip; which I guess is how they appeared in the original show.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I very much appreciated that the new show took the time to give them each distinct personalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The original show was a bit before my time and so wasn&rsquo;t my go-to nostalgic childhood show, but when I rewatched some episodes and the three kids were basically interchangeable, it kind of annoyed me.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, they use the smaller 3x3 design with cool baseball cap designs and some rounded tiles on their face to replicate the designs used on Scrooge.&nbsp;&nbsp;They use the wedge plates as feet too, and it&rsquo;s even more jarring at this scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also&hellip; the back of their heads are double plated, with a full white plate and then another layer of tiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;To me this makes the back of their head stuck out just a bit too far, and I think one layer of tiles would&rsquo;ve sufficed.&nbsp;&nbsp;And there&rsquo;s plenty of connections to allow for that, so the additional plate wasn&rsquo;t necessary for stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scrooge also uses the double plate width on the back of his neck, but for his size it&rsquo;s not as noticeable.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Honestly, BrickHeadz designs generally don&rsquo;t get too impressive, but these four characters are easily recognizable so I think the process worked for them.&nbsp; And lots of nice extra pieces too, and it was fun to have the colorful triplets included instead of just Scrooge.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a fan of the show, I think they&rsquo;re worthwhile.</p>
