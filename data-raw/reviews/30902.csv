<p>Between the 07th October and 10th November 2020 the Lego City Comic came with this motorcycle set.&nbsp; The cover price was &pound;4.25 in the UK, and this was the only set taped to the front.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The front of the packet, the standard large foil one for comics, declares that this is a Limited Edition!&nbsp; It also has a nice image of the motorbike and its rider.&nbsp; In the background you can see a police helicopter.&nbsp; As usual too, the age recommended for this set is 5+.</p>

<p>The rear of the packet has the 1:1 image of the riders dark orange crash helmet and visor.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>These sets are generally about the main character contained within the attached comic, and it&#39;s no different here.&nbsp; Pete Python is the star this time around, and he is a Private Detective too.&nbsp; When you first look at Pete he could easily be just a generic minifigure for anyone&#39;s city.&nbsp; Without the comic you wouldn&#39;t know what his profession was.</p>

<p>The parts&#39; usage for Pete are fantastic.&nbsp; The dark orange helmet and his earth green torso are rare parts that are the perfect inclusion here.&nbsp; The torso is printed on both sides too.&nbsp; The only other City set that the torso appears in is &pound;89.99&#39;s worth of the Tuning Workshop [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60258-1/Tuning-Workshop"">60258</a>].&nbsp; It can also be found in 2020&#39;s Monkie Kids Cloud Roadster [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/80015-1/Monkie-Kid-s-Cloud-Roadster"">80015</a>] and 2021&#39;s Ninjago City Gardens [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71741-1/NINJAGO-City-Gardens"">71741</a>] which are &pound;54.99 and &pound;274.99 respectively, so not in low-priced sets at all.&nbsp; The dark orange helmet has only appeared in one Hidden Side set, The Lighthouse of Darkness [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70431-1/The-Lighthouse-of-Darkness"">70431</a>], a &pound;44.99 set.</p>

<p>Pete Python comprises the following parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helmet - Dark Orange Mini Crash Helmet [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6294295/mini-crash-helmet"">6294295</a>]</li>
	<li>Visor - Transparent Brown Mini Visor 2 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6244785/mini-visor-2"">6244785</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow Mini Head No 3026 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6283884/mini-head-no-3026"">6283884</a>]</li>
	<li>Torso - Earth Green Mini Upper Part 5038 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6294404"">6294404</a>]</li>
	<li>Legs - Black Mini Lower Part [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/9339/mini-body-lower-part-black"">9339</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be great to have had an extra hair element to match the one in the comic, but with how rare the crash helmet is I can let that go in this instance.&nbsp; Pete&#39;s head element too is quite rare, but will probably pop up in a few City sets over the next couple of years and is currently available in lower priced sets.</p>

<h3>Main Build / Parts</h3>

<p>The only build in this set is a motorbike.&nbsp; It is a great looking bike, but with only 10 parts you won&#39;t need to follow any instructions to build it, and it should take less than a minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set though has the Motor Cycle Fairing No 8 in Dark Orange [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6292494"">6292494</a>], which like parts of Pete, is a rare element.&nbsp; I initially thought it was bright orange from the image in the back of the previous comic.&nbsp; Currently it only appears in one set other than here, which is the Tuning Workshop mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I have given five stars to sets from the comics before, but this pushes that rating right to its upper limit.&nbsp; The inclusion of rare parts that only currently appear in high middle to very high priced sets is great.&nbsp; I can imagine in a few years someone picking up a crate of Lego from eBay or somewhere&nbsp;and spotting the torso and thinking they have the City Gardens set in there.</p>

<p>If you get a chance to get this then do so.&nbsp; It certainly does not need to be used as a Private Detective and can sit on any Lego street quite happily.&nbsp; If this is attached to the front of the comics in the future as the second set I will be getting a couple more just for that bike part.</p>

<p>When you consider what a CMF costs now, this set is a few pence more, and you get a comic too.</p>

<p>In the next issue it&#39;s back to a police set with Duke DeTain, and it will need to be perfect to beat this one.</p>
