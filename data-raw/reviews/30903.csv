<p>I didn&#39;t care much about this set when it was revealed. The only reason I got it was as an extra that came with Ninjago City Gardens. While it is easily overshadowed by that set, I was still happy to get this.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really care for the building experience or the model. The bike looks alright, the color scheme really helps the bike look better. The best part about it though is all the parts that you can get from this set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>As someone who probably won&#39;t buy many of the Island sets for Ninjago, I was pleased to get this as it is a cheap way to get an Island Lloyd. The figure looks great, although it is missing the shoulder pad/sword holder and the bandana.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have to pay a cent for this thing, as it came free with the set I bought, Ninjago City Gardens. The bike looks to be about $5, which is fitting for something this small. I was pleasantly surprised to receive this, but since this comes for free, I can&#39;t really say if it is well-priced or not. If you can pick this up for under $10, I&#39;d certainly do it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>In the end, this is a small and forgettable polybag. I was pleased to recieve this because of the Island Lloyd figure, but not much else. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to buy this set, but I&#39;m glad that I have it.</p>
