<p>Part 1. The figure:</p>

<p>The figure is a party llama with maracas and roller skates (I&#39;m sure you knew that already). His legs are cyan with purple and lime stripes, pink knee-guards and a lime and pink belt. His torso is a pink and cyan patterned vest (this is the same on both sides), he has a whistle dangling from his neck, a tattoo on one arm and cyan and purple bands. His head is nicely sculpted, has two identical tattoos, a nice face print and cyan visor glasses (I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re called).</p>

<p>Part 2. The tiles:</p>

<p>You get a total of sixteen tiles but only two our exclusive and the rest are random.The two that should be included are these.</p>

<p>A lime tile with all kinds of tropical plants surrounding cyan text. And a cyan tile with a cyan leaf (that&#39;s not how leaves work) with yellow maracas and cyan text.</p>

<p>Part 3. The beatbox:</p>

<p>The front has a weak see-through screen which appears misty from every other angle and has a tiny rubber handle that is secured by proper Lego pieces. The inside uses a new stand piece with hinges you fold out to put your tiles in and scan. It&#39;s actually quite cool, but you can only put 12 of the tiles in. The side allows us to see the mist I was talking about and how the see-through screen connects. It connects very strongly and if the figure is inside, and opening it is very troublesome and once you open it your figure could fly out like crazy. The back has a lid to a storage compartment which has three possible design&#39;s. The first build either shows a llama in bushes a palm tree or Geoffrey The Giraffe waiting to eat the souls of children. The second build is one bright attention seeking roller skate. The third build couldn&#39;t decide weather it wanted to be two trees or two maracas, but I&#39;m confident that it&#39;s maracas. The storage compartment can store 16 tiles but if rotated at a 45-degree angle which you are meant to do the tiles at the top will fall down. The maracas are meant to be loose when stored because there&#39;s no special space for it. Incase you&#39;re wondering you can put a figure in there.</p>

<p>Pros: Awesome figure, great prints and cool display stand.</p>

<p>Cons: Awful storage compartment, weak see-through screen, tiny handle and horrendous price.</p>
