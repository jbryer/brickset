<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I no longer have the entire box, but for some reason have the box top cut off. &nbsp;I guess my Mom decided that the box tops were just as important as the instructions! &nbsp;It&#39;s a nice little representation of this small set. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Hardly earth shattering. &nbsp;Nice printed headlight/grill piece, and the windshield. &nbsp;After that, nothing too exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One lone police officer that lucked out with getting the keys to the convertible squad car for the day. &nbsp;My officer had stickers to add the button and badge to his torso.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty typical car build for the time. &nbsp;White car chasis, fenders/wheelwells, etc. &nbsp;The convertible is a nice set of grey stacked pieces to make it look folded up.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A nice, if not silly, squad car to patrol the streets of Legoland. &nbsp;It does the job, and you&#39;ll surely see that giant blue gumball on the roof, should your minifigs&nbsp;miss the stop sign well cruising Main Street.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Other than the odd idea of a convertible patrol car, it&#39;s nice. &nbsp;Clearly a good build that can be used again to create non Public Service vehicles.</p>

This is especially important as when I originally wrote this article, August 28, 2018, it was&nbsp;the classic cop&#39;s birthday! Let&#39;s get into the pros and cons.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It comes with the figure that started it all! You can never have too many of these guys. They are seriously versatile.</li>
	<li>A convertible police car! I like to think this cop likes to drive&nbsp;<em>fast</em>&nbsp;when he&#39;s after some crooks. I like to pretend that the car is a GTO! There are not too many classic convertible cars that have the lowered top showing, usually to lower down the piece count.</li>
	<li>The metallic front bumper&nbsp;piece and the police stickers! The metallic piece was the main reason I wanted to get this set. However, this also leads me to the con.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The original con that I wrote back in August 2018 was, for the most part, just a complaint about the front bumper. I was complaining as I didn&#39;t understand if it was detailed a print or a sticker. Since then, I have purchased an old sticker to use for the bumper, as the printed (or in this case engraved) piece that I was given when I purchased the set was incorrect.<br />
	Looking back on it, it&#39;s not necessarily a con of the set and rather a fault by the seller. I do wish that the set used the printed white/black bumper piece rather than a sticker, but that&#39;s about it.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Final Verdict</b></p>

<p>This is quite a pleasant set, but of course, it&#39;s only a car. For a car, it truly has a great design that would be expanded upon and improved during the 80&#39;s. For its charm, I&#39;ll be rating it&nbsp;7/10.</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T16:53:03.49Z","That's more like it!","<p>This set was second-hand, so possibly represents the best value-for-money of all our Lego vehicle sets. Although clearly an earlier set than the 381 Police Station, it went very well with those vehicles, and in our set often pinched the garaging spot from the motorbike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts-wise it&#39;s an early set featuring a range of innovative bricks which would soon become standard, notably the vehicle base plate and the iconic steering wheel. These features, making for a larger, more playable car, ensured a permanent&nbsp;move away from the non-opening vehicles such as the 600 Police Car. While this car is designed as a one-person car, it was easy to add another passenger perched on the folded-down roof. As such, it&#39;s no surprise our police car was never rebuilt or reconfigured into another form.</p>
