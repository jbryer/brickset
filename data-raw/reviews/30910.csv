<br />
$19.99 for this set just doesn&#39;t feel worth it. Now maybe if I had done the interactive of the music videos with this, that would be a different story.<br />
<br />
In the end, this is a glorified collectible minifigure with it&#39;s own special case and storage space behind to store all the 2x2 tile pieces for the various songs and singles.</p>

<p>Building the Container Base and the back was somewhat fun. That&#39;s a good unicorn design and use of the pieces.<br />
<br />
The Unicorn minifigure is what drew me to buy this set in the first place.<br />
<br />
In the long run, this just feels lackluster. and not for me.</p>
