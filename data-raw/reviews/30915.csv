<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>This time we got an animal again. And in my opinion, this tree frog is the most adorable creature that we got from Lego in the last couple of years. It is mostly lime green, with white belly and big red eyes. Its feet are orange and legs are partly blue. So we got nice amount of bright colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head is nicely curved, both on the top and on the bottom. The curve continue to the tail of the frog. Eyes are properly big and outstanding, with black pupils. All four legs can move on its own. Front has two point of articulation, rare - three. And after some minor correction, they can have fourth point, like the real frog have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frog can be posed in many ways, some of them are more stable than others. Overall, the model is very sturdy and quite big. I expected it to be much smaller. It looks great on a display or as a part of some bigger, tropical project.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Except from bright color, there is also plenty of useful bricks. For example, we got eleven curved bricks in many shapes and forms. Most of them are lime. There is also four of rather old hinged plates in blue. I haven&#39;t seen them in that color since Space Police I.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned, this set looks adorable. I love brick build animals, and this small and cheap set is a fine addition to my collection.</p>
