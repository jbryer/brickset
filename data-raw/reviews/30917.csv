"Minifig290","2021-05-17T19:58:14.433Z","Where's the Toilet Roll!!!","<p>Hello, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at one of the Summer 2021 LEGO Harry Potter sets. I&#39;ll be looking at the cheapest of the wave, the 76386 Hogwarts: Polyjuice Potion Mistake that retails for &pound;17.99 / $19.99 and releases June 1st everywhere but North America where it releases August 1st 2021. This set contains 217 pieces giving a price per part of 8p/ 9c.</p>

<p>This is one of six 20th Anniversary sets from the Summer 2021 wave that includes a golden minifigure and the chocolate frog cards. Let&#39;s start by talking about these.</p>

<p><strong>Anniversary Bonuses</strong></p>

<p>To celebrate 20 years of LEGO Harry Potter, LEGO have made a few bonus pieces and figures for the 20th Anniversary sets. This set includes 2 Chocolate Frog Cards and a Golden Harry Potter figure</p>

<p>The chocolate frog cards vary set to set, there are 16 to collect. In mine, I got Bertie Bott and Rowena Ravenclaw. These tiles are all printed on purple 2x2 tiles with either silver, gold, bronze or yellow designs around one of the 16 characters who could be on the card. These are randomly inserted in each 20th Anniversary set.</p>

<p>Now the Golden Harry Potter has Harry&#39;s usual hair piece but printed in pearl gold, same as his legs and wand. The two fascinating pieces are his face print which is the same as Harry&#39;s normal face but printed on a pearl gold head with&nbsp;dark yellow print. His torso has his outfit on front with little specs of sparkle printed on alongside his tie, house emblem and some creases but on the back there is print for a 20 with the following text &ldquo;20 YEARS LEGO HARRY POTTER&rdquo;. Finally, Harry is placed on a pearl gold 3x4 minifigure stand.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Now to the main set, there are three standard minifigures for Hermione, Ron and Harry Potter. Let&#39;s go in that order.</p>

<p>Before we go into specifics let&#39;s get the lower body bits done as all three use the same pieces. For the torso there is print for some Slytherine robes with the green and grey tie and grey jumper popping out from some bits underneath. This print continues to the back with a hood on the robes. They all use unprinted black legs as well.</p>

<p>Hermione uses a commonly used face that she has used previously, the face has a simple smile on one side and a more frightened expression on the other side. She also uses her usual brown hair piece, but you can transform Hermione and all the other figures. So how, well take her hair off and add this new for 2021 Cat Hermione hat piece that from the back looks the same but from the front has some cat ears and yellow eyes with light brown markings underneath and around a concerned mouth expression. This piece goes over Hermione&#39;s head piece.</p>

<p>Now Ron Weasley, he has a new for Summer 2021 head piece with a worried panicked face print on one side with a wide open mouth in shock, horror or surprise. We&#39;ll get to the other side of this head piece in a bit. He uses the common dark orange hair piece Ron has used since the 2018 relaunch. Now if you turn his head around and add common short hair piece in dark brown you get a minifigure for Vincent Crabble. His head piece is on the other side and a small mouth which also appears surprised but more confused.</p>

<p>Finally, Harry Potter. Harry uses a more angry and unhappy face which too is exclusive to this set because of the reverse piece, which I&#39;ll get to in a sec. He uses his common Harry hair piece in black. Now turning his head piece around and replacing his hair for a quiff short hair piece in dark brown you get a minifigure of Gregory Goyle, his reverse head piece has a confused looking expression with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s a mixture of small accessory pieces in this set, each figure has a wand piece you get a Black one for Harry, dark brown for Ron and light brown for Hermione. You also get some potions made using some round bricks in neon green colours with a golden 1x1 stud on top. You also get a polyjuice cup, the same used in the CMFs from 2020, but instead of being the orange used in the CMFs it is now a dark neon green in the clear cup. This piece is exclusive in this colour to this set as of now.</p>

<p>Finally, you get a small pot to make potions in, this is made using a simple pearl gun metal grey pot on a black 2x2 round jumper with a pearl silver spoon piece in the pot.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Now the star of the show, these are the toilets of hogwarts. Let&#39;s start by looking at the one main play feature for this set, which needs another set to work effectively.</p>

<p>First and tbh the main feature is that you can open the middle sink upwards and there is a 2x4 hole space that when stacked with the largest set of the wave, the 76389, were if stacked you will fall onto a slide that is included in the other set</p>

<p>Now to the builds visual features. Starting with the structure, the walls of this set use mostly tan bricks, plates and large wall pieces. From the back there is a small window using a 1x2x2 window piece in brown with a back lattice window insert included. Above this window there are two sand green cheese slopes with two little 1x1 pyramid pieces in tan on either side of the two cheese slopes. The wall has a few large pieces used to make it including two 1x4x5 panels with a window slit inside with a rounded top. Dotted around in the wall are a couple 1x2 nougat brick bricks which adds some texture to what would have been a boring exterior.</p>

<p>On to the sides of the structure, on the left side (from the front of the build) there are 4 receiving holes for technic pins to connect with other Hogwarts set from this 2021 wave and an archway. Moving to the other side, there is a large archway piece which uses a 1x6x6 archway piece in tan, next to that there are two technic pins to connect to another set in the wave.</p>

<p>Moving inside, the floor uses three 4x6 sand blue plates and a 2x2 sand blue plate, leaving the 2x4 whole to go to the slide in the 76389 as mentioned above, at the front are 7 1x2 grid pieces that represent drainage for any water that might get on the floor from the sinks, or event the toilet.</p>

<p>On the left of the build inside is a small toilet stall which is covered with a brown wall and a stable door to cover the stall when someone is inside, this is in dark brown. Inside the stall is a simple toilet build using an inverted dome for the toilet bowl and connected to the wall with a 1x1 plate with studs on side there are a few white pieces with a lever for the toilet back. The total size of the stall is 3x3 so can comfortably fit a minifigure, sadly none that are included in this set as none of them have legs that can sit. One thing to note is that when the door is opening it very almost hits the pillar, it can hit if the slips holding the door are slightly moved to the left.</p>

<p>The main attraction of the set are the three sinks which have the feature to access the slide in the 76389. The three sinks look the same from the outside using a pearl gold fossett, 1x2 light bluish grey brick with a metallic sticker for a mirror on top of a 1x2 textured brick in white. The two sinks on the side are build identically and have nice decor such as rounded 1x1 bricks, a 1x2 roof piece to nicely top off each back wall. The middle sink that opens outwards is connected to the top of the sink by two 1x2 plates with a clip. On the back of the sink there is a 2x6 tiles in white which holds the opening flap together.</p>

<p>Finally, on the top of the four walls are some sand yellow tiles and 8 studs so that you can connect with other sets from this modular wave of hogwarts sets.</p>

<p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well what a unique set, and all for the right reasons. Rarely do we see a toilet in LEGO that is so detailed as this. The builds for the sinks are smooth and amazing, the toilet is small yet really well done. Then the minifigures and accessories are amazing, and I love the inclusion of the alternative hairs and heads for each figure. The golden Harry and two Chocolate Frog cards are nice bonuses to this set and make this set collectable.</p>

<p>Some complaints, there is one major thing lacking from the stall, NO TOILET PAPER!!, how could they forget. Also, the toilet door does come too close to hitting the pillar, I think they should have made a brick built door that gives a bit more clearance when opening. Apart from that no other complaints.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting a cheap and cheerful set to gift, also if you&#39;re getting the large 76389 this is a must-have to go with the slide and to make the most of the opening sink feature. This is also a must-have if you&#39;re wanting the Golden figures as it includes the most important figure, Harry.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -&nbsp;</strong>Amazing minifigures, Golden Harry looks amazing, Well compact build, options to change minifigures, Cat Hermione&#39;s head piece, great value and pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Cons -&nbsp;</strong>The fact you must have the largest and most expensive set of the wave to make the most of the play feature.</p>
