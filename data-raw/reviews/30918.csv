"Neoka15","2021-06-12T10:52:38.8Z","Nice addition to 76389 Chamber of Secrets","<p>The box was 85% full, which is an amazing ratio, you rarely see Lego using box volume that much.</p>

<p>The minifigures are nothing outstanding, just another version&nbsp;of the trio in school robes and one more Hermione in gold. Looks quite appropriate for this set though, what else could have been expected here?</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t very much like Fluffy in this set. I have been longing to get Fluffy&nbsp;and was super excited at the announcement of Fluffy being released this summer, but I am not a fan of brick-built animals and just don&#39;t like the roundness of this Fluffy&#39;s heads. The one released 20 years ago is much better to my taste, too bad I didn&#39;t get it back then.</p>

<p>The Hogwarts part of&nbsp;this set is fine. I like the interior more than the exterior:&nbsp;I find the dog&#39;s room external wall a little too simple. The other rooms are good enough for me and are quite playable, I believe, although you definitely need someone else to inhabit the cute&nbsp;room under the roof, not the trio.</p>

<p>Overall, the set is quite agreeable for kids to play with, as it has several rooms and minifigs and a big dog. For an AFOL it&#39;s mostly an expansion for the castle and a Fluffy, if you like it, as the minifigs are not too impressive.&nbsp;The set might be a little overpriced by the parts count, though, I highly recommend to search or wait for a discount.</p>

<p>Starting of with the mini-figures there are 4 exclusive Harry, Ron and Hermione and a golden 20th anniversary Hermione. Harry Potter is very similar to the one from the chamber of secrets but has a different version of the new gryffindor torso, the Ron which is also exclusive to this set but has the same legs as Harry Potter but a slightly different torso and the same ginger hair from other younger Rons. The Hermione has the same torso and legs as harry, the same head as other young Hermiones but has long brown hair. The 20th anniversary Hermione is going to make this set a must for collectors who want all 9 golden figures it is the same Hermione from the set but with golden and a different torso similar to the one from Hogwarts moments.</p>

<p>The main build is part of hogwarts consisting of 5 main builds. The first build is the roof&nbsp;with controversial sand green roof as a throwback to the older sets, it also has two candles. The next build is a room for fluffy which has some windows a trapdoor and for interior a piece of meat so that there is enough room for fluffy. The next room is built on a 8x8 with a large window and place to put the harp. The final bit of hogwarts is the devil&#39;s snare which has a disappointing build for the actual devils snare and built on a rock like structure. The final big build is the actual fluffy, a dog with 3 heads, the actual build is pretty good despite a few pieces off colour. There is also a harp which is made of yellow and gold pieces and a useful sticker.</p>

<p>There are also 2 random chocolate frog cards which luckily will not be duplicates but could get duplicates from other sets.</p>

<p>Overall this set is one most Lego Harry Potter fans will want it, not just because of the build but to get the golden Hermione.</p>

Apprezzo molto la possibilit&agrave; di modificare la posizione delle stanze. Prezzo un po&#39; elevato.</p>
