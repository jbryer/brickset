There are not many stickers (15)&nbsp;in this set and the process of applying them is not too difficult or tiresome.</p>

<p>Minifigures are awesome! The professors have shiny metallic details&nbsp;in the design of their clothing, which I&#39;m thrilled with.&nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t mind the students had different faces, but it works fine as it is. Harry even has a different uniform compared to his fellow Griffindor students, which I didn&#39;t expect and was very much pleased with.</p>

<p>The parts are nice, I liked frogs of four colours (brown, pink, green and white). Nothing very special about the building process, neither dull, nor particular interesting for an AFOL.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t like the change of the roof colour, so that it doesn&#39;t match 2018-2020 sets any more. It doesn&#39;t even match in design&nbsp;my 2010 Hogwarts castle (4842) with&nbsp;green roof.</p>

<p>To my taste the attempt to do another Great Hall (which is not so &quot;great&quot;&nbsp;in size this time) is in vain, we have a good 75954 set, which is still available in stores now. I&#39;d rather the&nbsp;Chamber of Secrets were bigger instead.&nbsp;Lockhart&#39;s classroom and office are fine, not very spacious, but nicely decorated. I think the cramped rooms reduce the play value, as it is hard to place enough minifigures inside and operate them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t quite like the basilisk as it is very limitedly poseable and half of its tale is made of another type of plastic, not shiny. Still, it is much better than the short&nbsp;creature from 75954 Hogwarts Great Hall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a good set with amazing minifigures, though it seems a&nbsp;little overpriced for the parts count and the size of the finished model. Very highly recommended,&nbsp;if you can get it at some discount.</p>
