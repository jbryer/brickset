Also, an included horcrux would&#39;ve been sweet, nevertheless this set passes all of my tests, and is worthy of being my best and most expensive set, even though Harry Potter isn&#39;t even my favourite theme (marvel and dc) this set feels authentic in it display and presentation! Thank you, Thank You, Nick Vas and LEGO and i hope you come out with more large scale sets like this! (like a marvel one or dc- a Captain America&nbsp;shield and iron man gauntlet and Tony Stark glasses, star lord helmet, Iron Man arc reactor, eye of agamoto and more) or for batman a Utility belt and batarang a wonder woman lasso a couple of power rings for the lanterns, kryptonite,&nbsp;cyborg, robot parts, a lantern also for green lantern, A trident for aquaman, W.W bracelets, joker spray flower, the riddler cane, two faces coin, a small Lazarus pit, some nth metal,&nbsp;motherbox helmet of fate, some built lighting or a flash helmet mask. A joker camera, a Harley hammer. A freeze gun,</p>

<p>They can make a separate villains marvel, heroes marvel and dc villains and dc heroes</p>

<p>and the GOLDEN figures can be the justice league and so on!</p>

<p>Overall love this concept, and am happy i bought this set!!!</p>
