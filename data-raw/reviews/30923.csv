<p>The building experience was unusual. The first two bags make the board, which is a very straightforward process - basically a few layered plates for stability, covered with black and white tiles, and a couple candles around the edge for decoration. One part that confused me for some time was two tires sitting flush to the ground near the centre of the board, which I eventually realised are&nbsp;there to stop the board from sliding around if you are playing on a smooth surface.</p>

<p>Building the chess pieces obviously got a little repetitive, but the build isn&#39;t big enough for this to become particularly tedious. There were some interesting SNOT techniques used, and I particularly liked the use of the transparent minifig-jumping plate&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6285587/handle-no-1"">6285587</a>&nbsp;on the Knights to make it seem like the horses were rearing. I did find that the Rooks were a little ugly and blocky. I probably would have preferred it if these were&nbsp;the tower-like pieces you normally get in a chess set, despite this not being accurate to the film.</p>

<p>The parts in this set are fairly standard, obviously&nbsp;consisting of mostly black and white pieces. If you happen to be looking for some shortswords or miner&#39;s helmets, then this is an absolute gold mine - the set comes with 40 <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6349964/mini-short-sword"">shortswords</a> and 16 <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6349965/figur-head-clothing-no-3"">miner&#39;s helmets</a>, as well as a few <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/384426/mini-knights-helmet"">mediaeval helms</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6351360/mini-long-sword"">longswords</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6224071/whip"">whips</a>.</p>

<p>All 4 of the minifigures are unique to this set.&nbsp;The wizarding trio&#39;s torso pieces are easily the most interesting parts in the set, being unique to this set but still easily usable in any real- or semi-real-world setting. The Golden Snape figure is a little underwhelming and plain. As much as I personally love the character, I feel that a Golden Dumbledore (for example) would have been a much more interesting 20th anniversary figure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little difficult to rate the &#39;playability&#39; for this set - usually, this would refer to the features, moving parts, mechanisms, etc, in a set, of which this set has none. However, the set designers did choose to&nbsp;include the &#39;missing&#39; pieces that Harry, Hermione, and Ron fill in for in the film, meaning that you have all the pieces required to play chess. It also looks a little nicer and smoother than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40174-1/LEGO-Chess"">2017 Chessboard set</a>, but it is a little larger and pricier.</p>

<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;the make-or-break for the set is this - unless you are a completionist&nbsp;collector, the only significant&nbsp;appeal&nbsp;is the fact that it is a complete Lego chessboard. If that doesn&#39;t interest you, then this set is probably not for you.</p>

Upon buying it I was disappointed with a boring build and a weirdly less satisfying Lego chess set.</p>

<p>First, the figures, which are one of my favourite parts of the set. This is one of my favorite versions of Harry Potter from the first few years at Hogwarts, with him and the rest of the trio is very accurate to their appearances in the scene. The golden figures are nothing to get excited about in my opinion, even this Snape being incredibly bland and uninteresting.</p>

<p>The build is incredibly boring with most of it being repetitions of a couple basic techniques for around an hour. The pieces also have no way to stick to the board, often falling over and slipping around mid game.</p>

<p>The pieces, however, are quite helpful, with uncommon colors of swords and helmets featured.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2/5</p>

<p>Bland build and far inferior to 40174 Lego Chess</p>
