"Denimandlace","2022-11-25T05:54:55.71Z","Great  Value for mony","<p>The best thing about this set is the value of some of the more esoteric parts particularly the transparent &#39;flying rods&#39;. To purchase 3 of these independently costs as much if not more that the set itself. In addition you also get 4 unique minifigs plus some other cool parts. It has recently been on sale at Kmart in Australia for $35 AUD nearly a third of the original Lego cost. All good stuff for building your own MOC&#39;s.</p>
