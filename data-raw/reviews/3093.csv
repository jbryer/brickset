This lead to a small problem. If it was an ambulance, where did the sick people go? You could take off that bit at the back, lay a figure down and put it back again on top, and that seemed to do the job, but their head seemed to hang out over the back edge, probably not ideal if you were suffering from a back injury.<br><br>In short, what exactly IS a Red Cross Car? I don't think it's anything to do with the Red Cross, it seems to be for a doctor making house calls or something. Perhaps I'm just looking through it with adult eyes but it seems kind of pointless.<br><br>The design itself is fine enough, fairly basic and much the same as many of Lego's other cars of the era. Does come with stickers, but I don't think bricks with painted designs had come into being yet so there wasn't much choice.<br><br>An average set whatever way you look at it.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,2,4
