"Ephseb","2022-08-10T01:20:37.707Z","Amazing opportunity to get a rare figure","<p>I was ecstatic to hear via some fan forums that the October-November edition of the Lego Star Wars kids magazine would include not just any minifigure, but one that a) I never owned any variant of and b) only appeared in a 350&euro;+ UCS set and one unattainable Comic Con (later changed to United States-)Exclusive set. I bought the magazine on the day it came out, anticipating a high demand.</p>

<p>I rated the build with 1 Star but it just as well could&#39;ve been five because it&#39;s literally just the minifigure shown on the front, and there&#39;s nothing else to build. The figure is contained in a foil pack.</p>

<p>Luke&#39;s Bespin / Cloud City outfit is one of the most iconic in the saga, and it&#39;s nothing short of amazing to be able to get this version of him relatively cheap.</p>

<p>The figure consists 75% of dark tan parts: a leg piece with a pocket printed on each leg; a torso with some more pockets and a brown utility belt printed on; and Luke&#39;s shaggy medium-length hairpiece. The final piece is the flesh-colored head, featuring a calm / curious (?) expression on one side and a scared expression (&quot;That&#39;s not true. That&#39;s impossible!&quot;) with a bruise near Luke&#39;s eye on the other side.</p>

<p>Luke carries 2 accessories. I think the choice of equipment is perfect in this case: a blaster pistol and his fathers lightsaber, which he of course loses at the end of his duel with Darth Vader. [Old-Canon fact of the day: The lightsaber was later found by the Imperials and kept in the Emperor&#39;s secret storehouse on Wayland, before being recovered by Luke. He then gifted it to his future wife, Mara]</p>

<p>Considering the previous availability of this figure, the &euro;4,40 are certainly reasonable. I&#39;ll probably give the magazine to a younger relative of mine, should any of them be interested.</p>

<p>The play value isn&#39;t really there of course, it being a single minifigure, but if you&#39;ve got Darth Vader, you can start the most famous duel of the Star Wars saga right away!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, I really like this gift, it&#39;s a neat opportunity to get a rare figure and I&#39;d definitely recommend it to anyone who missed out on the UCS Cloud City and the Comic Con Cloud City Duel set. The only issue I encountered was the fact that the hairpiece doesn&#39;t seem to have the necessary clutch power to stay securely on the head. I&#39;ll try to test whether this also occurs with other copies of that same hairpiece&nbsp;(Edit: It does not. Swapped the hair piece with another Luke figure and now both sit clutch on the respective heads. Yay!)</p>

<p>This Luke Skywalker Minifigure is incredible and from one of his most iconic outfits .&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure -</p>

<p>The like has this episode four and five hair piece but in a dark fan colour , a confident facial expression and an amazing second face print with the &quot;Nooooooooooooo&quot; expression from the famous scene , the torso shows his dark fan jumpsuit and that continues on to the legs .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include a regular blue blades lightsaber and hilt and he has the normal blaster pistol in black .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this the best magazine figure in history and will probably never be overtaken his face print likeness and accuracy to the cinematic masterpiece of a scene that the bespin duel is unparalleled I recommend this to many different lego star wars fans , but good look at finding it as it is October 2020s magazine issue and I luckily found it at the back of a magazine rack in a shop , so if you want this look now as this figure has been and probably still will be sought after and worth a pretty penny .</p>
