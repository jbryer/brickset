Though at last 2 of them are not officially named and&nbsp;Rufus was actually Mr. Borgin, the set itself is still a great supplement for the Diagon Alley.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Minifigs</strong>: The selection is great for huge HP fans or those who own the great Diagon Alley set. (but it might not be very friendly for others.) I suppose the 2 unnamed figs are&nbsp;Doris Crockford and&nbsp;Dedalus Diggle, as the figs do look like them,&nbsp;who appeared in the first movie at the Diagon Alley. I&#39;m grateful for lego to increase&nbsp;completeness to the HP characters even though these 2 are usually ignored. Mr. Borgin, on the other hand, is quite impressive in the second movie, but the fig itself isn&#39;t very similar to&nbsp;the real Borgin.&nbsp;Btw I hope lego could remake the&nbsp;Borgin and Burkes store soon.</li>
	<li><strong>Parts</strong>: Dumbledore Army&#39;s printed tile is awesome, and exclusive ofc, and 2 potion bottles are beautiful, even though they&#39;re not exclusive. It is still the cheapest way to get these 2 pieces.</li>
	<li><strong>Value</strong>: $15 is usual for a minifig pack like this. Anyway, I think it is worth the price compared to the previous HP minifig pack.</li>
	<li><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: the design of minifigs used many old parts from other figs, which lego has always been doing like that...</li>
</ul>

<p>I encourage lego to continue making HP minifig pack cuz it&#39;s a great way to add playability to HP&#39;s other large sets as HP is a world with so many characters and accessories.</p>
