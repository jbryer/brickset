"Natethegreat101","2020-12-17T00:31:27.94Z","All About the Bees","<p>Despite being the usual basic build for a Minecraft set, there were some fun bits in here. I particularly enjoyed building up the oak tree with the bee&#39;s nest and the play feature for the angry bees.</p>

<p>An obvious&nbsp;play feature for the angry bees allows them to chase players in a circular motion, though only if the minifigure is in the immediate area&nbsp;around them. It is quite the&nbsp;fun idea and I do appreciate this&nbsp;as it is&nbsp;a&nbsp;game accurate mechanic. Flowers and crops located all around the set&nbsp;for the bees to pollinate is a simple thing, but it does help with playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the bee&#39;s nest itself can only fit one bee, a clever solution is used by having an empty area hidden in the leaves of the oak tree. A section of leaves can be removed to allow two bees to be stored in this space.</p>

<p>The beekeeper figure is a welcome&nbsp;figure&nbsp;that&nbsp;features a pair of newly molded pixelated wings that represents the long awaited&nbsp;elytra. I must admit though that this new piece tends to fall off quite easily, so that was a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Honestly, the inclusion of a villager was completely unnecessary. However, just as it was the case with 21138 Melon Farm, it is a welcome addition as one can never really have too many villagers.</p>

<p>There is quite the number of rare or unique parts:</p>

<p>x2&nbsp;1x2x2 tan wall element</p>

<p>x2 3x3 tan plate</p>

<p>x1 black technic lever 4M</p>

<p>x1 bright green 2x8 plate with holes</p>

<p>x1 bright green 2x4 plate with 2 knobs</p>

<p>x2 2x6 dark green brick</p>

<p>x1 2x8 reddish brown brick</p>

<p>x2&nbsp;reddish brown 1x2 plate with vertical tube</p>

<p>x1 dark bluish gray technic lever 3M</p>

<p>x2 sand blue pixelated wings (Minecraft elytra wings)</p>

<p>x1 2x2 flame element (Minecraft fire)</p>

<p>x2 cool&nbsp;yellow 2x2 decorated flat tile (honeycomb decoration)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, new printing for the&nbsp;faces of the bees are&nbsp;done on a yellow 1x1 tile&nbsp;in both an angry and neutral expression. 4 of each face are included. The build for the bees is&nbsp;a fantastic&nbsp;combination of existing&nbsp;parts.</p>

<p>With a very generous inclusion of eight bees total, a&nbsp;Villager, a bee inspired player figure&nbsp;and a&nbsp;baby sheep,&nbsp;this is by far one of the best Minecraft sets of this size.&nbsp;</p>

"Kiiranaux","2021-03-09T19:37:33.323Z","Buzzing with parts and play features","<p><strong>The Bee Farm</strong> is an action-packed set buzzing with bees and their caretakers.</p>

<p>The scene takes place in a forest biome. A beekeeper villager keeps watch near a hive, waiting to extract the precious honey. In swoops a player, spouting glider wings from their late-game accomplishments, when - oops! A fire is started, drawing the ire of the swarm!</p>

<p><em>Overall / Playability / Value : Higher than other Minecraft sets</em></p>

<p><em>Parts: Very good for a Minecraft set (2 unique minifigures, 8 new bees, exlusive elytra glider)</em></p>

<p><em>Building Experience: Well above average for a Minecraft set, with surprising places to hide the honey bees and a clever mechanism to &quot;swarm&quot; with the angrey bees.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Rather than 1 bee, you get 8 - four happy and four angry - plus two extra face tiles</p>

<p>Elytra is accurate to the source material and easily used with any minifigure</p>

<p>Great, lego-faithful recreations of hive, honey, honeycomb, and bees themselves</p>

<p>Two new minifigures - one using the Villager mold and one unusual minecraft &quot;skin&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little bit of everything&quot; with a baby sheep, crops, 3 flower colors, and two tree types</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Uses familiar Forest instead of a new or interesting biome<em> - but it&#39;s the only appropriate biome for this scene, and makes a good expansion for your Minecraft lands.</em></p>

<p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>

<p>None. Everything needed is included</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

<p>Must-buy for <em>play, parts, panorama</em></p>

<p><strong>My Minecraft Reviews:</strong></p>

<p>Lego Minecraft takes Lego back to the best of its basics, with a standardised system of interchangeable &quot;blocks&quot; representing familiar Minecraft elements. I collect and review each of the Minecraft sets so that you can decide whether they&#39;re a fit for your play, parts, or panorama.</p>

<p>My MC ratings from 1-5 are compared <em>only</em> to other lego MC sets, otherwise categories like Parts and Building Experience would all be low compared to all sets, while Playability and Value would be high compared to all sets.</p>

<p>Like many Minecraft sets, this depicts a small chunk of a world environment, with varied terrain height and style, alongside several play elements that enhance the overall experience.</p>

<h3>FIGURES</h3>

<p>There are 2 minifigures, alongside a Lamb and Bees.</p>

<p>The Villager features a specialised head mold that includes the prominent nose, and is printed simply but clearly. The torso is also a special part, featuring simple printing that even wraps around the &quot;crossed arm&quot; part of the body.</p>

<p>The &quot;player&quot; is uniquely dressed as a bee, and has Elytra wings. Much like other items brought over from the game, the wings are not replicas of the in-game asset, but rather a midway point of being mine-crafty enough to know what it is and generic enough to be used elsewhere in other constructions</p>

<p>The Lamb used the Minecraft animal head part, and has a very defined face print. The rest of it is made up of actual bricks, which in this case is perfect to get close to the in-game model. This simple approach to creatures keeps them in-line with the source material.</p>

<p>The Bees come in 2 flavours, being calm and angry. Bees are brick built, apart from the face which is a printed 1x1 tile. The face tile prints are very sharp and have solid colouration. The wings are a transparent 1x2 plate, granting the impression of wings very effectively.</p>

<h3>BUILD</h3>

<p>The terrain build is mostly simple and vertical, but with several height levels and small details. At water level is a small carrot patch and flowerbed, moving up 1 brick is a more open grassy area with a few 2x2 tiles with 1 stud to attach the hay bales or flowers to.<br />
There is also a beehive that is built into the oak tree, which allows for stowage of bees and honeycombs. The beehive itself is more tunnel-shaped, with a 1-stud gap to push bees back out if they go in too far, avoiding having to tip the whole assembly downwards to get it out. The leaves of the tree is a surprisingly complex assembly that allows for storage of 2 bees under a very well integrated cap.<br />
Also included is a fire element, which is a dual-molded part that has really well-defined &quot;pixel&quot; shapes to it, producing a very minecraft-looking part.<br />
The next height up has a small birch tree, some flowers and the &quot;angry bee&quot; play feature. This is an offset stick that holds 4 angry bees, and rotating the gear off the side of the terrain makes them spin around.</p>

<p>A transparent stick is also included to allow for placing bees &quot;in-flight&quot; around the terrain.</p>

<p>A mixture of assembly methods, from vertical with bricks and plates, a small amount of technic for the &quot;angry bee&quot; feature, with SNOT for the tree-leaves storage space. Everything is well attached and sturdy.</p>

<h3>CRITICISMS</h3>

<p>As a result of the &quot;small chunk&quot; of a world style, the inclusion of a villager is strange, as there is nothing even resembling a village structure here. The same goes for the lamb, as it feels as if it&#39;s got lost at some point and has just ended up here. While each element is well produced, it feels oddly out of place.<br />
There is just 1 transparent stick provided, meaning that 3/4 bees are grounded at all times, unless they are put on the &quot;angry bee&quot; stick, which has black and dark grey technic arms exposed, in contrast to the green surrounding it, making the technic element very obvious.<br />
The honeycomb print on the 2x2 tiles is bordering on being so simple that it is unclear what it is. Without the context of bees it could be lava or molten cheese, as its pattern and colours are very ambiguous.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>For the price and part count, this includes many great, if misplaced, things. This includes the 8 total bees, which feels like a generous amount. The selection of flower colours is nice, alongside the places to move them around too. The inclusion of a villager and lamb feel off, but add suprising variety, allowing for much more play value. Small parts like having a 1x3 tile in the beehive to represent honey, the carrot patch and easily moveable haybales adds a range of details and things to do. The build itself is a range of basic to medium-complexity, with the terrain being simple and the tree-leaf storage being the latter, with brackets and window frames being used to great effect.</p>

<p>The point of this set is to show a farm for bees, and it covers that basis, with many bees, some being angry, a beehive and a variety of flowers, alongside a &quot;player&quot; who seems to be trying to live like a bee by becoming one. This deviates with the extra elements. Overall, at this price point especially, this results in some high-efficiency play and display value, with varied building methods and colours throughout.</p>

<p>It is a good value toy, and a good Lego kit.</p>
