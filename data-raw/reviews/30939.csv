The final result is quite eye catching as well.&nbsp;The colorful background is of course accurate to the source material, as this set is meant to be in a mesa/badlands&nbsp;biome- complete with the start of an abandoned mineshaft.</p>

<p>The namesake trading post is effectively done making use of the wandering trader&#39;s general colors.&nbsp;A neat little feature to the build is that the table for trading items actually flips- a very effective way to represent the trading post&nbsp;being closed.</p>

<p>A simple 2 piece&nbsp;tnt play feature is hidden into the abandoned mineshaft&nbsp;to clear the mineshaft rail tracks.</p>

<p>As for the parts, the two notable inclusions are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 Dark Orange&nbsp;6x6&nbsp;Plate&nbsp;</li>
	<li>2 Dark Blue Flat Tile 2x2 Inverted</li>
</ul>

<p>The trader lamas also have exclusive prints to them and use&nbsp;a new mold for their face. The face also makes&nbsp;use of a&nbsp;1x1 plate and a printed 1x1&nbsp;tile for the mouth. The lamas are excellent and accurate to the source material, which is funny to me because....</p>

<p>The wandering trader figure itself is all wrong. The figure should have had an additional layer of red pixels surrounding the face and&nbsp;the torso&nbsp;printing&nbsp;should have used red printing on the torso instead of the reddish brown used. As the figure is, it&#39;s ok for what it is, but it is quite awkward&nbsp;when compared to the lamas.&nbsp;I don&#39;t quite understand how the designer missed this, as both the lamas and even the trading post structure&nbsp;make use of red!</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great little Minecraft set- as long as you can get past the inaccurate&nbsp;wandering trader figure.</p>

"Kiiranaux","2021-03-09T18:58:59.223Z","Two great MC vinettes in one cute set","<p><strong>The Trading Post</strong> is a great little set that combines two vinettes into one convenient scene.</p>

<p>The scene takes place in a Mesa biome. A Wandering Trader has set up shop and unhauled wares from his two Llamas; Steve spies the shop while emerging from a blocked-up Mineshaft, pursued by a Skeleton.</p>

<p><em>Overall / Playability / Value : Higher than other Minecraft sets</em></p>

<p><em>Parts: Good for a Minecraft set (due to unique minifigures, Llamas, and Mesa-colored pieces)</em></p>

<p><em>Building Experience: About average for a Minecraft set, with 1 standard working catapult.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>The Mesa biome is beautifully constructed using shades of red, yellow, and brown, and provides a reasonable amount of parts to recreate this biome using your own ideas.</p>

<p>The new trader minifigure and llamas are a great addition to the lineup</p>

<p>The two vinettes are really quite separate, so there&#39;s double the potential for your scenes.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Llama nose pieces are printed poorly; luckily you get a spare of each one</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing really new in the Mineshaft vinette to merit its inclusion; <em>however this was probably necessary to sell three new mini/animal figures at $20, and pays for itself by providing great Mesa colored pieces.</em></p>

<p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>

<p>The only change I would have made to this set would be the addition of a chest for the trader, perhaps with other options for sale like an Ender Pearl or Seeds.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

<p>Must-buy for <em>play, parts, panorama</em></p>

<p><strong>My Minecraft Reviews:</strong></p>

<p>Lego Minecraft takes Lego back to the best of its basics, with a standardised system of interchangeable &quot;blocks&quot; representing familiar Minecraft elements. I collect and review each of the Minecraft sets so that you can decide whether they&#39;re a fit for your play, parts, or panorama.</p>

<p>My MC ratings from 1-5 are compared <em>only</em> to other lego MC sets, otherwise categories like Parts and Building Experience would all be low compared to all sets, while Playability and Value would be high compared to all sets.</p>
