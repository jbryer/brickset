"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T14:55:58Z","I love this set.","This one of my first set ever. The little treasure is neat, and everyone likes smiling skeletons (I don't like that new, ugly skeleton head). I remember I played that the skeleton became alive and scared the pirate away.
For such a little set, it rocks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-15T02:44:27Z","Starter","I think everybody bought this set at some time or another. Its a great starter set for your money with a, pirate, pistol and coins in a barrel. This set can easily be adapted to other pirate bases like Shipwreck Island.A real bargain.The only thing stopping this from a 10 is the skeleton. I think this set would improve with a Marine instead.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-24T18:19:04Z","Another great mini island set","this is one of the many sets with a yellow baseplate that can be put together to make a rather large pirate colony. i like this set because Brigand (it says thats his name in the UK name thing) has put the palm leaf over that little rock niche and hidden the barrel of treasure there. of course, it isn't a very good hiding spot, but if he puts the rotting skeleton with the conquistador helm in the way, it should be able to scare off attackers. this is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-11T20:17:38Z","Great and interesting set."," Another of my childhood sets, this set makes for an interesting story. It includes a pirate with gun and sword, perhaps about to turn the corner into a small cove. Inside lies a previously deceased Spanish Conquistador(I think that's what they call them). Anywho, it features a slightly larger baseplate to the set &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;. This makes for more creativity. Also included are gold coins, a skeleton, a palm frond and a barrel. I remember having hours of fun with this, and I'm sure you will, too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-28T03:34:19.13Z","Pretty cool","I don't really care for the pirate sets from the Spanish Armada era, but this one is actually quite good. There is a nice little cave, covered with a palm leaf (I always like those green touches). I also like that there is a barrel instead of a regular treasure chest - already have enough of those. 

The skeleton is cool! It made me decide I want a lot of them and create a skeleton pirate army. That army now lives on Skull Island and sails around in a Renegade Runner, scaring the sh*t out of everyone. Mwuahaha!
I would have preferred an ordinairy (striped shirt) pirate minifig in this set however. Don't really like these later torsos and faces. But still a good small set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-26T23:17:32.733Z","Island of the Dead","Finished building this one last night before bed so I figure I'll review it now. I remember wanting this set as a kid for the skeleton as I didn't have one at the time.

The island base is a key point n this model to me as most of my small previous pirate models were a small board 6x4 or two joined together which was lame. This one is one solid piece 8x6. 

The cave is very basic using two large pieces for the inner walls and putting some other bricks on the outside to look run down. It has quite a nice effect but could have been done a little classier. It dose have a “u” shaped slit in the back which could have been avoided. 

The leaf over the top was a good idea and I like the way it has been designed so it clips onto both points. Also having it on the angle is quite effective. The barrel full of gold coins is a nice touch and it is different as most of these small sets came with a chest of gold.

The pirate has more of a newish look to him and is dressed in blue pants, white shirt, green vest and a red hat. He looks very pretty and has lots of colours. His face is quite mean looking with a moustache and stubble. He is armed with a cutlass and a pistol.

The skeleton is an old style skeleton with loose arms that rotate 360 degrees. His black helmet implies he is a deceased Spanish Conquistador. Basically one of the good guys, but he can be what ever you want. I really liked him and had allot of hours fun using him in other play until I got more skeletons.

Overall it is a great little set with good playability due to having the two mini figs and is very aesthetically pleasing to look at. I feel this set is a 6/10 or Above Average as you can have so much fun with this little set. I would recommend this set to any LEGO fan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-29T15:14:55.53Z","Skeleton Crew","This small set is one of the sets from the pirates theme and was released in the year of 1996. Like some of this theme, this small have few pieces and no new things. The building is also simple, but the pieces are useful, the color scheme is good and the design is nice too. The miniigures are simple, just a pirate with a sword and a hat and a skeleton with a pirate hat. The set is just to increase other from this theme or other lego, so, this small features few building. The base of the set is a combination of gray pieces to hide the skeleton and the barrel with the treasure. Altough the set have some useful pieces like the minifigures, no new things and also few building makes it not be a so much useful small. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Andrei_Anichkin","2009-10-16T02:26:28.67Z","6232 Skeleton Crew","I got this set from Russia. it is really cool and rare. I believe it is from the 90's. 

PROS
- Pirate's revolver
- Skeleton conquistador style hate
- Palm leaf on rock/cave thing
- treasure

CONS 
- Rock thing could have been better.
- They could have fit in another barrel of treasure or something.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-26T11:38:02.837Z","What Crew?","<p>Set #6232 Skeleton Crew: I sorely wish I hadn't parted with this as part of my Cousins' LEGO gift of my older sets, this little gem was greatly loved. Oh well, on to the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skeleton Crew is an Impulse set plain and simple, but it is a fairly decent Impulse set for the Pirates Theme. it includes two Mini-Figs, a small rock alcove and a chest filled with treasure. The model itself isn't why you'd want this set, mostly the gold pieces, the Pirate Mini-Fig from the Imperial Armada Sub-Theme sets and the Spanish Helmet piece are the real reasons for wanting this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that this is a great Impulse Set from LEGO back in the day and still worthy of picking up for a Pirates Collection nowadays, when LEGO brought Pirates back in 2009 I was hoping they'd stick around long enough to re-visit this part of the Sub-Theme. But perhaps in the next Pirates Revival we'll get to see some of these prints again. Because that Mini-Fig has a really good print.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,4
"wipefeetnmat","2011-08-18T10:33:14.863Z","Ahh a skeleton","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a set that I got when I was about 7 or 8 and I had a lot of fun with it.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a cool pirate and skeleton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a good amount of weapons and treasure.</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The rock cave could have been built bigger. 
<li>Why is it called skeleton crew there is only one skeleton!?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over all this is a good set but should have included another skeleton.</p>",TRUE,5,3,2,3,5
