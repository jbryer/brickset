We didn&rsquo;t get much for the theme last year but they were really great sets, an excellent example of quality over quantity. Now besides The Batman wave, we&rsquo;ve been left with nothing but a pathetic 4+ set for the whole year&hellip; At least The Batman wave was decent&hellip; On a side note, here&rsquo;s a review of the smallest set of said wave! Excuse my lament of the current state of Lego DC.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><strong>Batman&rsquo;s Bike:</strong> I believe this is supposed to be Bruce&rsquo;s bike but modified to be bulkier and more bat-themed. Right off the bat (ba dum tss), I really like the new pieces for the base of the bike, it helps to keep the size relatively small and creates a better scale when compared to minifigures. As for the details, I like the engine motors that protrude from the sides and the use of the batarang as the control handle is neat. I&rsquo;m not completely sold on how the front head looks though, I get what they were going for with the bat ears and all but it feels 1 stud too thick, it doesn&rsquo;t look bad or anything but definitely a bit odd. A single sticker is used for the headlight of the bike as well. Overall, a fun and decently satisfying bat-bike.</p>

<p><strong>Selina&rsquo;s Bike:</strong> Catwoman&rsquo;s bike is somewhat similar to Batman&rsquo;s, it uses the same base, but appears less bulky and sleeker, which makes for a more appealing design in my opinion. A sticker is used at the front for the headlight and 2 levers are used as the controls for this bike, and I like how they kinda resemble ears. Lastly, the back holds a removable crate which contains stolen jewels within, the cover for it has a sticker for a fragile sign as well. Overall, I prefer Selina&rsquo;s bike over Batman&rsquo;s for its simple, sleeker and versatile design, good stuff.</p>

<p><strong>The Bat Signal:</strong> The last build is a simple but effective bat signal. This signal distinguishes from its predecessors by the use of a glow in the dark round tile, a sticker for the bat symbol is put over it and it looks really cool. A little side attachment is present as well and it holds onto a batarang and a grappling gun. Overall, it doesn&rsquo;t beat the bat signal from<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70917-1/The-Ultimate-Batmobile"">&nbsp;The Ultimate Batmobile</a>, I don&rsquo;t think any signal&nbsp;would ever top that, but this one is pretty solid and probably the second-best bat signal we&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>Batman:</strong>&nbsp;There are just many things wrong with the Pattinson Batman figure. I&rsquo;ll start with the positives, the print for the torso is very well-done and I greatly appreciate the full head and hair provided to have Bruce Wayne unmasked, a fantastic inclusion consistent with all 3 sets of the wave. And that&rsquo;s basically it, everything goes downhill from here. I don&rsquo;t know what Lego was thinking to have so much of the gray carried over from the torso to the legs only to have it cut off from the sides and not be dual-molded, it looks very awkward and painfully unfinished. I also don&rsquo;t know what they were thinking reusing the standard long-eared cowl and outdated face prints. As everyone has pointed out, the short-eared cowl would&rsquo;ve worked infinitely better, and just retire the old face prints already, they&rsquo;ve been using it for more than a decade for crying out loud, I thought the Pattinson Batman figure would definitely warrant a new face print but nope! Never has an official minifigure prompted me to heavily modify it, I ended up swapping out the head and cowl entirely and replaced the arms with printed arms from an extra Black Widow I bought off BrickLink. Overall, I think it&rsquo;s an ok figure on its own, but it completely dropped the ball on accuracy and cutting corners. It&rsquo;s not completely awful, it has like 2 redeeming qualities, but it otherwise completely misses the mark. Lego, do better.</p>

<p><strong>Selina Kyle (Catwoman):</strong> On a more positive note, I like the Catwoman figure quite a bit. As is usual for the character, she sports a catsuit, the print for the torso is very intricate and I love the silver shine on the belt buckle and zipper. Admittedly though, the lack of leg print is disappointing but not too big of a deal. The 2 excellent face prints feature a cunning smirk and a smile with a raised eyebrow and they perfectly capture the character. The hair choice was fitting and I&rsquo;m pleased with the inclusion of her bike helmet, giving an option to swap out the hair with. Lastly, her accessory is a chain. Overall, some leg print would&rsquo;ve been nice but otherwise a great and accurate figure that came out really well (wish I could say the same about Batman).</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Perhaps&nbsp;the best aspect of this set is the price. R250 for this feels reasonable and fair. For that price you get 2 figures, 2 bikes and a bat signal, pretty substantial if you ask me, especially when compared to minifigure packs.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Overall, the builds are decent and fun, I like how the bikes aren&rsquo;t oversized and the figures, while flawed, are nice to obtain. I just really liked the amount of stuff I got for the price, the content itself is nothing particularly outstanding, but is substantial and perfectly satisfies the &ldquo;conflict in a box&rdquo; check box. However, if you own or plan on buying the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76183-1/Batcave-The-Riddler-Face-Off"">&nbsp;Batcave</a>, I think it&rsquo;s perfectly safe to skip out on this one, especially since both figures are available there. But if you&rsquo;re on a smaller budget and would like a set from The Batman, I see no reason why not to recommend this set.</p>
