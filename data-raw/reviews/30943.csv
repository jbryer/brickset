<p>The Han Solo in carbonite keyring upon reveal was a promotion i was very harsh on but man was I wrong .</p>

<p>The &quot;Minifigure&quot; I guess-</p>

<p>He is just the carbonite Han solo part moulded in a metal that I do not know the name of , with his creased shirt , smooth hair , uncomfortable facial expression and the side consoles and obviously the ring it&#39;s self .</p>

<p>The packaging -</p>

<p>Now if you have ever read one of my reviews you know that I do not talk about the packaging or the instructions , it comes in a sleek matte finished black box featuring only the Lego star wars logo and the inside has padding and an exact slot for the keyring , it is incredibly high quality .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is amazing , when it was revealed I thought &#39;oh great , another non physical set star wars promo &#39; but&nbsp;I was wrong it feels so professional and high quality Lego clearly put their all into it , let&#39;s hope MM4GA (make may 4th great again ) comes to fruition next year and it is as high quality as this , but that may 4th promo should be a figure not another diorama so I recommend this set so much but it had a limited quantity and is already worth a fair bit on the secondary market .</p>
