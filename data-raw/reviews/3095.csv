"MPH","2007-08-24T14:52:09.393Z","Another good small set","The small pirate sets usually give you very good value for money, and this one is no exception. The parts are good (flag, shark, weapons and TWO oars - as opposed to the dull 1713/1733), and it's also nice to get a blue vested pirate (who was not all too common in small sets at that time).

As a set this will keep you entertained for quite some time and it's a great companion to the larger pirate rafts. Get it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-12-07T20:36:22.233Z","Don't Go Overboard!","Another one of my classic pirates sets from back in the day. This one is something different again, just in the way it is constructed. How many boats were there, opposed to non boat vehicles. The yellow bricks give a true feel of buoyancy and after he gets back to his crew they double as spare cannon balls. It has an oar mounted on one side only. This is because the raft is too wide to operate two, but it doesn't make it useless. He obviously goes with the tide and simply uses the oar to straighten up. He also has a spare oar, a cutlass and a black skull and crossbones flag.

The mini-fig is a happy pirate despite being stuck on a raft in the middle of the ocean. He has grey pants, with a blue shirt and a brown three point hat. His face has stubble with an eye patch and black hair. He also has a brown pistol. This model also comes with a shark, which I'm sure is making the pirate feel even safer on his raft. A bird could have been nice in this set just to keep him company.

Overall a lovely wonderful set that was an excellent addition to mine and any one else's pirate collection. If I remember correctly it was also well priced bak in the day. So a 6/10 for good aesthetics, something different and many hours of childhood play. A must have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-19T16:01:24.297Z","A revision exercise, but useful","This set is well worth its money. A good supply of weapons, a flag, a copy of the sharpest dressed pirate of the pack and a nuissance to be dealt with, coming in the shape of a shark.

If you're ever in need of yellow 1x1 round bricks, for a palisade stronghold or something, this is the set to aim for. Sixteen pieces! The only set that contains more copies of this brick is a huge yellow train-station.

Even though I liked the pirate theme very much, this set ultimately made me feel that the lego company was a bit lost for ideas, since this was yet another raft in the mere three years that the theme existed. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-21T15:52:50.343Z","Good Raft","This is a small set from the pirates theme and was released in 1991. Like some other small from the same theme, this include so much useful pieces, and a creative building. This include a lego original shark minifigure, a pirate minifigure, a raft and also some itens like the flag, pistol and the hat. The both minifigures are simple and with a nice design and color scheme, in the classic lego style. The itens like the hat, pistol and flag are characteristic from the pirates theme, and good detailed. The raft, have a good building system that uses some useful pieces like the yellow pieces that makes minifigures' heads. The playability is basic, due to the small size, but still awesome, cool to play with. So, i rate the &quot;Renegade's Raft&quot; 5/5

"AETerry","2011-01-24T18:06:21.29Z","Renegade's Raft Review","<p>Another Pirate's classic from way back when the Pirate's theme first came out. Price wise, compared to small sets of today and taking in inflation rates, it was priced very well, especially for a kid who's saving up and going out to buy their own set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A set this size fell into either impulse or a low enough priced set for a child to get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's one minifigure and a shark in this set. So if anyone wanted a shark, this was a cheap and easy way to pick up one. The accessories were standard with a pirate flag, pistol and sword. The raft was also a simple enough build utilizing yellow cylinder elements for the logs.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-26T11:20:39.42Z","SHARK OFF THE PORT BOW!","<p>Set #6234 Renegade's Raft: This little set was a great little set to pick up for your child when out shopping, it also made an excellent stocking stuffer for your little Pirate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Renegade's Raft was a fun little model, but it was limited. Although you could enjoy it amongst a larger collection of Pirates sets, alone it didn't offer much play value. What it did offer however was a cheap method of collecting multiple Pirates and Sharks for your LEGO Pirates Collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Pirates Collector in my youth this set was a godsend, having a cheap shark or two meant that I could enact Feeding Frenzies and all it cost was less than 5$ Building an army of Pirates with the tri-corner hat was a bonus, and the cutlass and pistol accessories are always fun to include in your pile of weapons/accessories. I'd say this would make an ideal addition to one of the shipwrecked island sets, a tiny raft with a lone survivor just adds to the display. For children though, unless they have more Pirates sets already there isn't much to play with in this set. But they'd love the shark to death.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,3
"Ernst","2012-01-23T16:27:58.447Z","Renegade's Raft or Will he shoot the shark ?","<p>Overall 4 bricks: very nice small set which is very nice on its own, very playable en contains very much nice parts for a set this size. Also a usefull addition to your other Pirates sets of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks: building concerns only the small raft, but considering how it is built I give 3 bricks. Under the baseplate you mount a very strong and good invented construction of 2 brackets,&nbsp;16 yellow studs and 1 gray plate and after 21 years it still does not fall apart. Upon the baseplate of the raft a hinge with a steering paddle and 2 small weapon holders and a flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks: in one small set&nbsp;1 great looking pirate (love the torso), a vlag, 2 paddles, a sword and pistol and of course a shark. Very generous in such a small set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks: will the shark snatch the pirate or will the pirate shoot him or just try to flee ? The&nbsp;3 major possibilities for the single set and of course a great addition if you have other pirate sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks: Average value according to Bricklink now € 3,85. Defenitly worth it considering the content of this set, it can only increase in value I think.</p>

"mr_hazey","2011-06-08T18:18:56.113Z","Renegade's Raft","The Renegade's Raft was the second set I bought when I decided to start re-collecting the Pirates once again, this set I also had when it first came out in 1991. This set is very similar to set 1733 but out of the two this is the one most people prefer. The set comes with one mini figure and 38 pieces, mine cost me £10.52 plus £1.85 P&amp;P from eBay.<br/><br/>The set I won came with no box but the original instructions in very good condition for something that is 20 years old. First thing you had to do is assemble the mini figure, which comes with hat, the condition of mine is excellent, no marks, scratches or dints, for 20 years old I was very impressed. Next up was the shark, which was already assembled, the shark that came with the set was not in excellent condition with a few lumps and bumps on it, so a quick search on eBay and for £2.20 I got myself a brand new one to replace the old one.<br/><br/>The raft itself is built in 8 stages, with stage one and eight no more then images, the raft is very simple to build with the underneath done by stage 4 and the top done by 7, the whole set was very good except one piece&nbsp;which was part of the back which held the oar, so again I went back to ebay and managed to get a 2nd raft minus the mini figure and other parts for £3.20 and I replaced the damaged piece and kept the other bits for spares. I was very pleased to finish it today with all the pieces in top condition and it now sites nicely on my shelf along with the other sets I have, overall a small set but I like it, you get a shark and decent mini figure with sword and pistol and a good raft to boot, for me it is one of my fav smaller Pirate sets.<br/><br/>",TRUE,4,3,2,2,2
"bricksan","2012-01-04T14:09:54.903Z","Review: 6234 Renegade’s Raft","<h4>Introduction</h4><div>This set was the first one I purchased after getting back into LEGO, after a good 15 year absence. I originally owned this set the first time ’round, and I am aiming to get back all the old sets I once owned. The only way to do this is to buy it second hand, so my first port of call was eBay. At the time of purchase, I was unsure what a decent price was for it, so I may have spent over the odds for it. The set I purchased came without a box, sadly, but I don’t buy sets to sit in boxes so wasn’t really fussed. The main things for me personally were instructions and a decent condition. In the end the set cost me £10.52 including P&amp;P.</div><div><br></div><div>The set itself was originally released during the Pirate Theme’s most popular era, which for me was 1989-1992, though some may dispute that. The set was out in 1991 and was a small set containing only one mini figure; however it came with a shark which was good, as you did not get many sharks with the smaller sets. I think at the time I only had one other shark, so it was a welcome addition to my growing Pirate horde.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>When the set arrived I set about cleaning the bricks in some luke warm water and washing up liquid. This was due to the dust been very visible on the black bricks. Other than the dust the set was in near new condition with only the black 1×2 &nbsp;with 1 Stud needing to be replaced. I sourced the part required via Brickink. I then waited till the spare part arrived before assembling the model.</div><div><br></div><div>Thankfully this did not take long (3 days) so I then set about building my first bought set since coming out of my dark age. ( I had gotten the two PoTC sets in The Sun first. &nbsp;The build itself is very straight forward, the first mate comes with a brown tricorne hat and is one of my favourite mini figures, then I put the shark together, again rather easy as it just requires the head to be attached to the body.</div><div><br></div><div>The raft consisted of 8 stages but if you don’t count the first and last stage then it’s a 6 stage build. I remember building it the first time round the easy of the build. I do however find newer instruction manuals a lot easier than older ones, especially in the much larger sets.</div><div><br></div><div>On the first 4 stages you build the bottom of the raft, once you have done the under side it is then on to the top. The top consists of a &nbsp;holder for the oar at back the moves up and down and &nbsp;then the side holder for the oar and sword, this is where the all important pirate flag goes. Stage 8 is a case of adding the minifigure and shark.</div><div><br></div><div>After I built it I went looking for the box photo as all pirate sets at the time came with images of &nbsp;other models you could make with the parts. I built all 3 of them, my favourite of the 3 is the platform one. All 3 are easy enough to build and all require the photo as a point of reference when building. Plus with all 3 you end up with parts left over as well.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>The build is rather simple and one you can do without the requirement of instructions, I did enjoy the build but from start to finish it must have taken less that &nbsp;5 minutes. &nbsp;If you add the extra 3 models you can build you can get a good 20 minutes building time out of the set.</div><div><br></div><div>While &nbsp;the &nbsp;build is the most challenging the set is &nbsp;one I do like. There were other small raft sets but due to the shark and the extra oar in the set it made it the best and for £1.99 &nbsp;it was a bargain. You can pick up a near mint condition on for less than £10 if you shop around. If your a pirate fan then it’s worth getting for your collection.</div><div><br></div><div>Images: http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629714090868/with/7191620666/</div><div>Review on my site: http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/6234-renegades-raft/</div>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3
"James83","2021-07-02T17:48:30.243Z","Renegade Versus Shark","<p>This little pocket money set caught my eye when I first saw it, it was an inexpensive way to obtain an additional pirate minifigure and a shark too.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This raft looks good, those yellow tube bricks representing some kind of wooden floats catch the eye and look cool. Today they would probably be brown bricks, but they add a dash of&nbsp;colour. This is no lash-up job though, our renegade pirate has carefully constructed his raft. One oar is&nbsp;mounted on a hinge brick as a rudder and&nbsp;two clips are provided for stowing the second oar plus a cutlass. A short antenna brick serves as a mast with a Jolly Roger flag (no stickers in this set). The raft is quick to build and is very sturdy on any rough seas and handles any rough handling on the carpet&nbsp;(it can withstand Lego cannonballs too!). It is&nbsp;large enough to stow a stolen treasure chest aboard and leave enough room for the pirate to still steer his raft for a crafty escape.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This shipwrecked pirate was fairly common, appearing in no less than 7 sets with the same grey legs, blue printed tunic torso with an unshaven eye-patched head topped with a brown hat.&nbsp;Being a renegade pirate he came well-armed with a flintlock pistol and a cutlass.</p>

<p>A standard Lego shark with opening mouth (if you stuck your little finger in there you could get a nip!).</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This set was just so playable. It&nbsp;was easy to build but had enough features to look good and with an array of hand-held parts plus with the shark&nbsp;it was full of fun as a stand-alone set. It also&nbsp;worked well alongside all the other Pirate themed sets. I don&#39;t think I made any changes to my set at all, it was perfect just the way it was.&nbsp;In 1994 Lego realised a similar set, 1713 Shipwrecked Pirate, but with a much more basic raft. This set is far superior.</p>

"Chrinchy","2020-07-28T16:22:18.143Z","Up A Creek But This Time With A Paddle","<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This small set is simple to build and fun. I think that&#39;s the way it should be for what you pay for so no complaints for me. Assembling the shark is easy, the mini figure is easy and the raft itself was fun.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>You get 38 pieces in this set, the most notable are the small yellow pegs that keep the raft afloat. I&#39;m not sure what they are supposed to be exactly, but they add some nice colour and look different from the barrels you get in bigger raft sets.</p>

<p>As for the mini figure itself, he is the standard first mate and the fact that the title of this set is Renegade&#39;s Raft, I&#39;m going to assume he had a failed mutiny against his Captain and had to be sent away on his own OR the pirate life just wasn&#39;t for him LOL.</p>

<p>The grey shark is always a welcome addition and this is one of the cheapest ways to get a shark.</p>

<p>Our renegade sailor come swell equipped with 2 paddles, a flintlock, cutlass and flag which are the pieces you were the most excited about as a kid.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This small set offers some good playability with the shark being the real danger to our lonesome sailor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>I think you get good value in this set, certainly the pieces fit well together but you also won&#39;t have a hard time taking it apart and mixing it up with other sets.</p>
