<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>I cannot say, that it looks poor. It doesn&#39;t. The cage is designed just fine, with enough attention to details. I like how they manage to make the whole floor tiled up, and leave no space without bars. The bars just goes all around the cage. Also, the small opening hatch at the top looks surprisingly good. You can try to fit a dino through it, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. It can be used to feed the dino though. The wheels are a bit too small, so when you lower the support bar, the cage elevate at a weird&nbsp;angle. It only a minor mistake, but still, it is one. Main hatch works perfectly fine, it is quite easy to put a dino inside and make it stand on its own.</p>

<p>As for bonus content, we got said dino, in olive green with dark green markings. He was available only once before, in the biggest set of 2019 wave. So it is good to get him in a considerably lower price. Then we got a bag that was introduced in city line a couple of years ago. It looks and works fine, I have no complaints. And the last thing is a chicken leg. How typical. But it&#39;s great to get one more.</p>

<p>As a standalone set, it looks weird. Of course, you can detach wheels and make it an ordinary cage, but a wheelbase is a part that hold everything together. Detaching it makes the whole model extremely delicate. But if you have a set that was out in the last issue (5/20), then you have a small complete set. This cage is designed to match the quad, So when you combine it, it becomes quite a decent set. Also, you can just make a quad of your own. It won&#39;t be too hard.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Except for the dino, I think the most valuable part would be 3x4 bar/ladder. We got two of them in this set. They are quite useful. Also, most of the semi tiles can be easily used in some models of yours.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I treat this set as an addition to the quad I already have. If I hadn&#39;t bought the quad, I probably wouldn&#39;t have spent my money on this thing. Dino fig makes it quite valuable to collectors, but for me it&#39;s not really worth the money.&nbsp;</p>
