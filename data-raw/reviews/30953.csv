It is written like a travel guide and gives a brief two page spread for each planet in the book. Exceptions are made for a few major planets, such as Tatooine which gets four spreads.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts of the book are written by Yoda, and enjoy those parts your child will. Most planets provide you with a top three sights, along with three things to pack, and an introduction to the Star Wars characters most associated with each place. Many characters will get repeated, such as Han, Lando, and Chewie who each play important roles on a variety of planets.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another common feature is reviews of planets or places on them, written by the characters who played a role in these places. The reviews are funny and instead of providing a characters actual name, it features their online name (a joke that gets lost on younger readers who aren&#39;t allowed to freely use the internet).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book covers planets from all three trilogies, plus Navarro. Of course my kids were super excited to see Baby Yoda in the book, although I was a little surprised that he is simply named The Child and not Grogu, although the name Din Djarin does appear in the book. I think that there was a real missed opportunity by not having the actual Yoda interact with him.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set does come with a Yoda minifigure who has many accessories. He has a backpack, walking stick, and. 2x2 printed tile with a map of the galaxy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I highly recommend this book, especially if your kids enjoy the other DK Lego Star Wars books. I can easily see this becoming our next bedtime story.&nbsp;</p>
