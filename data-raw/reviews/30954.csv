<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>For me this lunar lander looks weird. It is a bit futuristic, but also feel very classic. It is in some ways similar to Apollo 11 landing module, in some it is a completely different model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a craft it looks decent. It has four golden legs, long ladder/stairs to the canopy. Canopy looks good, is nicely rounded, has some minor details like those 1x1 arches in light gray. They give the model a nice touch. Entrance to the canopy is made of 1x1 brick with technic pin hole. It&#39;s a nice technique. Everything is covered by 3x3 dish in light gray. At the top there is a satellite dish, attached to the 3l bar. As for the model goes, it is all.</p>

<p>So now is time to complain. For me those legs are way too long. They make this craft looks extremely slim and thus weird. But unfortunatelly, right now I don&#39;t see any possible way to repair this mistake. LEGO doesn&#39;t have any brick, that would fit here better. Also, the satellite at the top is too big, the reason is the same. There is also couple other things that bothers me. 1x2 plate with bar, that holds ladder, is in white, when should be in gray. Underneath the canopy there is only one plate, whereas in Apollo the bottom section is the same height as the top. I&#39;m no saying, that this should be an exact replica of Eagle. But this bottom part should be at least a brick thick. And it also misses a thrust. It&#39;s not something big, but could add a nice touch to the final model.</p>

<p>As for the playability there is none. Legs can move, but the craft can stand only, when they are correctly aligned. You can also move the ladder up and down, but it doesn&#39;t count as playability. It is clearly design to stand on a display or for parts.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There is round 50 bricks in total, counting spares. And they are great. We got a set of four dishes in gold (and it is not this standard gold color, but one bit darker) and four bars in gold (unfortunately, they are in standard gold). Four 1x1 with bar in gray are very useful. 1x1 arch is fine to making small details on MOCs. 1x4 plate with technic gear tooth is quite rare part, I don&#39;t remember seeing it in the last couple of years. And there is also on stud in red, which is completely random.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>If you are a fan of space exploration, and you want to compare this model to the big Apollo 11 from last year, you will be disappointed. Lego doesn&#39;t make this set to resemble that craft. If you are a fan of space in general and you want to have some lunar landing module, then this could be ok for you. After some minor changes, it could look beautiful. And if you need some nice parts for your models, then this is your way to go. It is cheap (here in Poland it costs 12zl, so it will be round $3), and the part list looks impressive.&nbsp;</p>

"Adameus","2022-04-16T12:36:36.92Z","A nice parts pack","<p>This polybag has a pretty nice build, a little simplistic, but looks pretty nice. It represents the Apollo lunar landers quite well, a nice mix of realistic and fictional elements. The build isn&#39;t very complex, but what could you expect from a polybag.&nbsp;Looks quite nice on a shelf, and I bet it would look even better with microfigures. But the only reason I&#39;d recommend buying this are the golden&nbsp;elements, which can make nice weapons and ornaments. It&#39;s a good enough value for the price.&nbsp;</p>
