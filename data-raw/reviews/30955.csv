<p>Duke Detain is the cover character for Issue 33 of the Lego City Comic, which was available between 11th November and 08th December 2020.&nbsp; This was his first appearance in the comic and he comes with a small sub build and a couple of accessories.</p>

<p>The price was &pound;4.99 in the UK, which is standard when you get a free second set.&nbsp; Mine was <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/952002-1/Fireman-and-Drone"">952002</a> the Fireman and Drone set from Issue 24 for which I gave two stars in my review.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The foil packet has a great image of Duke on the front jumping over the roadblock, which is the sub-build for this set.&nbsp; He is also holding the two accessories that you get - the handcuffs and signal.&nbsp; In the top corner is an inset image of Duke Detain too.</p>

<p>The recommended age of 5+ seems high as it is a very simple build and a Minifigure.&nbsp; On the rear of the packet is the 1:1 image of the handcuffs.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>I believe that Duke Detain is one of the main characters in the Lego City cartoon so considering we have a had a few characters from the show appear attached to the comics already it seems that he is overdue an appearance, so it&#39;s great that we have him now.&nbsp; The only shame here is that he is identical to the version that appears in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-minifig-cty1042"">these</a> five other sets.&nbsp; There are other versions of Duke that have different torsos, but this is probably the best choice for him.</p>

<p>The black hair element looks great on him, but probably best with the sunglasses side of his head.&nbsp; The packet does not show you, but his head is printed on both sides - one side has sunglasses and an open mouth grin, and the other side shows a smile with huge eyebrows and bright eyes.</p>

<p>Duke Detain is made from the following parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hair - Black Mini Wig No. 200 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6213798/mini-wig-no-200"">6213798</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow Mini Head No. 2970 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6271407/mini-head-no-2970"">6271407</a>] - Printed both sides</li>
	<li>Torso - Earth Blue Mini Upper Part No. 4816 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6271410/mini-upper-part-no-4816"">6271410</a>] - Printed both sides</li>
	<li>Legs - Black Mini Body Lower Part [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/9339/mini-body-lower-part-black"">9339</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>For a traffic cop the accessories seem correct, although the handcuffs seem like a bit too much as there is no one for Duke to Detain.&nbsp; The torso and head are unique to Duke Detain, but the other elements are slightly more common - the legs very common.</p>

<h3>Main Build / Parts</h3>

<p>Upon seeing the small build, my seven-year-old son said &quot;what is that?!&quot;.&nbsp; It feels very much like the designer put their hand in a bag and blindly grabbed a few parts and stuck them together.&nbsp; The result is what we have here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to have a printed piece and the 2X6 Roof Tile [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6230281"">6230281</a>] is quite rare, but it&#39;s not enough to save the set.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is basically a CMF with a few extra parts, so the value is pretty good.&nbsp; As the Minifigure is the same as six other sets I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth tracking down if you missed out on this.&nbsp; Hopefully the diver in the next issue will be an improvement to this set.</p>
