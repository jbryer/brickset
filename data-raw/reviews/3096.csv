The little buildup of sand is also a nice little effect. Unfortunately my little sister ate all those valuable gold coins :-( but that's okay, I got more in other pirate sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-11T20:10:11Z","Very fun set"," I had this set when I was younger and loved it. Getting back into lego recently, I longed for it once again and bought this, Skeleton's Crew, Pirate's Plunder, and Eldorado Fortress MISB. First off, let me say that there isn't much to the set. In fact, it took me less than a minute to assemble it. However, it is an interesting scene where a pirate unearths a great treasure with his trusty shovel. There is a small buildup of sand to give the set a freshly dug feel. A monkey looks on as the pirate checks his find. A very fun set indeed, whether you see this new or used for close to original retail, snatch it up!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-07T04:45:26.537Z","A great little set","This set started my pirate lego addiction. It's very tiny, but also very &quot;piratey&quot; i.e. loaded with features. You get a regular (but still my favorite!) pirate and a nice monkey companion, a pirate flag, a treasure and more tools/weapons than the pirate on its own can carry! The island itself has not much to it, but I love how lego added the little leaf: the perfect finishing touch for a wonderful pirate set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-12-12T06:10:58.39Z","Gold Bonanza","Another classic from my collection, which provided me with many hours of fun as a child. This one is basically a pirate and a monkey digging up some buried treasure. As a child I always assumed they were on a desert island but it could go anywhere. Also I never understood the stacked up yellow bricks. They are obviously the sand he has moved to get to the treasure. The rocks and the green really add to this tiny model and show how much thought LEGO were putting in at this point. The treasure chest is quite standard but it dose have two sets of coins in it. The flag is just your standard black and white, skull and crossbones.

The mini-fig is wearing grey pants, a blue and white striped singlet, with a red towel hat. The monkey is a standard brown monkey with all four limbs move and are clipable. Between them they have a cutlass, a pistol and a shovel.

Overall it was a sweet model as a kid and a must for any pirate collection. It has great aesthetics and has lots of playability by itself or with any other pirate model. Overall I would rate this model a 6/10 or above average, as it has no flaws and a few neat things but nothing that great to make it stand far enough out for a seven.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-08T14:08:12.293Z","Pirate's treasure","This small set is really small and with few pieces, but also with some useful pieces and in a old classic building form. With characteristics of pirates theme, this set includes basically a pirate, a monkey and treasures, combined with a little flag. The figure, well designed and with a classic Lego style, also have a weapon. The monkey is good builted and like all the other Lego old monkey figures. Unfortunately, this classic set not have much pieces to have more fun and playability, but still good. So, i rate the Buried Treasure 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-17T05:15:56.56Z","GOLD!","This set is just fantastic. Although its really small,its also really cheap! Its worth it for the monkey,gold and weapons alone-you can never have enough of these three things in the LEGO Carribean.
As Pirates is my favourite theme,perhaps Im biased but the monkey is soo cool,and you can use this little bed of sand to bridge the gap between two islands. I give this set 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-19T17:23:39.53Z","Like a monkey on your back?","The monkey, the coins, the flag, the weapons, the headgear and the customized face on the minifig. Half this set was completely brandnew in 1989. It instantly lured me into collecting the other sets of this splendid new theme. And in doing so, this set had accomplished exactly what it was designed for, I guess.

Like most of these little sets, the fun only kicked in after you had some other sets to go with it. But it is remarkable how this effect doesn't occur the other way around: this set adds little to nothing when you already own the bigger sets.

The first-generation flags that you'll find in the 1989 lego sets all have one serious drawback: They're made of a much more rigid kind of plastic than the later generations, which causes the clips to snap off very easily",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2010-02-02T12:13:56.03Z","Cute little set","I just bought 6235-1 on Ebay for a few euro's. It's a good no-nonsense small gift set. It contains a nice red headed pirate, a monkey, two cutlass swords and a shovel. There's a standard treasure with 8 pieces of gold (standard 2x10, 2x20, 2x30 and 2x40 printed coins).

<p>Due to it's size, no there isn't a whole lot of building being done. It's close to being a parts or extremely small Minifigure pack. I say pack as I always count the monkeys.&nbsp;And it's good. If you got it back in the day or off ebay, this set provided a cheap easy way to get a chest with the pirate gold, monkey, flag, Pirate mate and some accessories.

"bricksan","2012-01-13T06:54:02.487Z","Review: 6235 Buried Treasure","<h4>Introduction</h4><div><br></div><div>Buried Treasure was released way back in 1989 in the first wave of pirate sets and was lucky enough to own this the first time round. &nbsp; When I made the decision to get back into LEGO, this was one of my must have sets due to it’s nostalgia. While this set is only a small one at 20 pieces, it still holds fondness for me due to it reminding me of happier times in my childhood.</div><div><br></div><div>I managed to purchase this off eBay for £3.99 and it came with everything including the instructions and box. Although the box was rather battered it allowed me to enjoy building the other designs on the back of the box. For your money you get 20 pieces and back in the day would have set you back around £1.99 here in the UK. What I like about this set is you get a minifig, monkey, shovel and a treasure chest, plenty of playability pieces for your money.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>The set comes with 20 pieces, take away the 8 gold coins and you are down to just 12 pieces. That includes the monkey and minifigure. So with that you know the build is rather simple and it is. The instructions split the build into 5 stages. Stage one is &nbsp;just the base plate and stage 5 is the completed build. &nbsp;It is a build that can be done without the need of instructions and building time is less than 5 minutes.</div><div><br></div><div>I feel while the build is nothing to write home about, this set is all about playability and that is helped by the extra 3 models you get to try and build from the images on the back of the box. I really feel LEGO need to bring this feature back as it encourages people to build more with their sets. The 3 extra models are the minifig taking a sleep while the monkey waves the leaf in his face, the second one is the minfig in the chest digging the gold out and the last one is &nbsp;a strange design with the chest one side and the lid at the other and not sure what the designer was doing with this one.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>LEGO don’t do sets like these anymore, pocket money price with plenty of enjoyement in the box. The build is not good but the set makes up for it with the playability and the parts you get in the set. You can pick a decent one up on the 2nd hand market for less than a tenner and if you are a Pirate fan it is one of the best small sets there is. I got mine in near mint condition and only had to replace the leaf &nbsp;due to bite marks on it.</div><div><br></div><div>Images:<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629813808488/with/7233839464/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629813808488/with/7233839464/</a></div><div>Review on my site:&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/6235-buried-treasure/"">http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/6235-buried-treasure/</a></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"T79","2016-01-18T10:26:30.627Z","One of the best impulse sets ever!","<p>Over the weekend I spent some time with the kids building all sets we have with 20 pieces or less (from 1979&#39;s #886 Space Buggy&nbsp;to 1998&#39;s #6324 Chopper Cop), and when I asked which one of them was their favourite both immediately pointed at this little gem.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I no longer have the box, but if I remember correctly there was this alternative of the monkey using the leaf to wave some fresh air to the dozing pirate which I found hilarious. That must have been one well-trained monkey, though I guess he should be if he can brandish a sabre as well. The instructions are your standard tiny set folding little sheet with a coloured background&nbsp;which I assumed to be an evocation of parchment but I could be wrong.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This small set was released in the first wave of pirate sets in 1989, and what a goldmine for parts it was! A monkey, a small&nbsp;pirate flag, a plant leaf, a treasure chest filled with new chrome gold coins and a new pistol and sabre. Even the shovel was a relatively rare part in our collection, as was that yellow 4 x 6 plate.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Technically, just one: a rather friendly looking pirate (sergeant Mendoza from the old &#39;Zorro&#39; tv-series always came to mind) in a then new, exciting outfit; a blue-striped shirt (no backprinting in those days so it looks like he&#39;s shirtless from the back though) and a red bandana. The little monkey could also be seen as a sort of&nbsp;minifigure and back in 1989 it was fresh and exciting to get one. It is still in use today so this part has certainly proven it&#39;s worth.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really? There are just 7 pieces to &#39;build&#39; here (or&nbsp;9 if you count the flag and antenna) so what building there is to it is over in a jiffy. It probably took longer to remove the coins from the sprues they came on (funnily enough, those sprues were also kept to serve as gold bars) but I&#39;ll grant that a nice build is not really the point of this set. :)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A little pirate vignette that fits in the palm of your hand and tells a small story all on its own. The only part that feels a bit out of place is that pirate flag (why mark&nbsp;the location where you bury your treasure so conspicuously?) but I&#39;m not deducting points for adding a nice extra piece.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Is this what lego perfection in 20 pieces looks like? If not, it comes awfully close: a pirate with a monkey and a treasure&nbsp;with a&nbsp;tiny spot to bury it in. My children choose this tiny set over all others with the same amount of pieces (those we have, I should add - totally not being subjective here), indeed they choose this one over bigger sets so if you want an affordable, enjoyable&nbsp;pirate set look no further&nbsp;- it can still be&nbsp;yours for&nbsp;pocket money!</p>

"Chrinchy","2020-08-04T19:24:22.81Z","Do you ""dig"" that treasure?","<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>A simple small set to build. Instructions are quick and to the point, and they made the set feel like the treasure is partially buried in the sand and I like that effect.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some cool parts and of course being one of the first Lego pirate sets released, some were original. You get a cool looking pirate with a red bandanna and striped muscle shirt, you get a monkey (Haven&#39;t you always wanted a monkey!), a treasure chest with some coins, a pirate flag, a shovel, a cutlass and a pistol. And then of course you get the green foliage, some bricks to resemble sand and a baseplate.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>For kids, this would be a fun set to play with. Of course not every Lego set can offer hours of playtime but having a pirate and monkey can offer some fun adventures to an imaginative mind.</p>

<p>Me as an adult I have a lot of fun displaying it and it pairs well with other pirate sets too.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money:</strong></p>

<p>At the time it was great value for your money if you were a fan of collecting sets and pieces. The monkey and the fact it&#39;s a first wave set means buying it now may not be worth it unless you&#39;re a die hard pirate fan or trying to collect all the sets.</p>

"PhilBuilds","2022-12-29T01:36:14.243Z","Pocket money perfection!","<p>A while back, Paypal offered me &euro;5 credit to simply log into my account (it had been a while). Well, I looked that gift&nbsp;horse straight in the mouth, clicked the link, and sat back to consider my newfound wealth. Specifically, how I would convert my windfall to Lego. As I&#39;d just started a Pirates collection, 6235 seemed the ideal candidate. A few clicks on eBay and a nice used example was on it&#39;s way. I had loose change from the fiver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had this set as a kid and remember buying it in our village toy shop. The kind that doesn&#39;t really exist anymore with a bell on the door, an elderly man behind the counter and little stick on price labels on the boxes. I remember being pretty delighted with it and kept it permanently assembled and proudly displayed next to my Barracuda (when it wasn&#39;t out on an epic&nbsp;sortie). I think it speaks volumes that an eleven year old who was fortunate enough to have some large sets still really enjoyed this small one. It&#39;s a great little set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have a bit of a thing for these small sets. They don&#39;t so much tell a story as give the builder&#39;s imagination a starting point to create one of their own. Throughout the Pirates theme many of these were released (North Americans got even more) but for me, Buried Treasure stands out. Everything about this little sets works well. Aesthetically it&#39;s <i>really</i> good, with the small number of parts forming a coherent scene. The colour palette is perfect with the Pirate&#39;s red bandana providing a nice accent. For a great many of the original recipients, this Pirate would have been their first minifigure with a face other than the classic grin. The treasure chest, with real plastic gold coins, pirate flag and monkey generously fulfilled the main aim of this set&hellip; to provide kids with an affordable &#39;in&#39; to the then new theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again I find myself pretty delighted with this set and pleased to have it in my collection. Eventually, I&#39;ll incorporate it into a large diorama containing all of the Pirates sets; for now though, it&#39;s displayed on the corner of my desk, a 17 piece totem representing my collection as a whole and&nbsp;silently declaring: &quot;A proud AFOL sits here&quot;.</p>
