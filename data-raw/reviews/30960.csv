There are three white baseplates and 2 tan baseplates.&nbsp; This works well with the Modular House because it also has similar baseplates.&nbsp; This set has 3 white long windows (can also double doors) like the Modular house along with matching red ones.&nbsp; With the two sets combined this allows us to build really large houses with two full bathrooms (yellow toilets and tubs are the same in the sets, also has white sinks).&nbsp; There are many white bricks for building the structure including many 2x3 bricks--great to get one out of many binds.&nbsp; It also has the 2x1x2 brick high pieces that are super useful for building thin walls (or backs of chairs or bed so the characters don&#39;t fall out).&nbsp; It has these in white and brown.&nbsp; There are many flat (half the height of a normal brick) brown pieces (2x6) that are used for nice accents in the NewYear celebration home but work great for making longer counters and shelves for all the cool food. The coolest features of this set are the three stacking bamboo baskets with steamed pork buns inside and the red lanterns!&nbsp; The plate of dumplings (picture is printed on) make me hungry and there is also seafood.&nbsp; The children&#39;s plate for the preschool is less appetising. It comes with several nice figures.&nbsp; The grandma and the mom are my favourite.&nbsp; It has a red tea pot and two (large) tea cups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
