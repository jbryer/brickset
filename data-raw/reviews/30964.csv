<p>I&#39;m a rapidly approaching 40 adult fan of LEGO. I&#39;ve built everything from multiple modular buildings, the roller coaster and most other expert fairground sets, modern Ideas&nbsp;sets such as the blacksmith, many speed champions cars, and of course most things in between. I&#39;m new to the Monkie kid theme and wasn&#39;t sure what I thought of it a couple years ago when it launched. Actually, I thought it was too weird and random for me. But I&#39;ve come around recently to several of the sets, and this is one of the 3 sets I decided to check out, in addition to the much larger secret HQ and fruit flower mountain.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>I was flat out impressed. The build of the main jet had multiple clever and odd building techniques, which reminded me of a larger speed champions build as much as anything. At least twice I stopped and said, &quot;wow, that&#39;s pretty clever.&quot; Just a super fun and satisfying build.</p>

<p>The toy capsule vending machine was a simple but also very fun build. Half the stickers go on this and the other tiny builds, so the number of stickers on the actual jet is very reasonable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a moc guy. I like to build sets by the instructions. So the only insight I have here is that I love the colors of many&nbsp;of the parts, and was surprised by the larger than expected size of many parts in the set. This is not a set with mostly tiny pieces. Which brings us to...</p>

<p>Value:</p>

<p>Simply put, I think $50 US is perfect for this set. As mentioned above, I feel the average size of the pieces in this set is larger than I expected, so I think this is one time the price per piece is very legitimate. Going along with that, the size and bulk of the jet is bigger than I expected even after seeing many images and videos. Even if this set&nbsp;were sold as JUST&nbsp;the jet for $50, it wouldn&#39;t be ridiculous. The fact that the vending machine side build is legitimately cool makes the value perfect.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finished model/final thoughts:</p>

<p>I simply love the way this jet looks in person. I think it&#39;s a brilliant, original LEGO design. The color scheme, the build process, and the heft of it once finished exceeded my expectations. The fact that the primary side build is also excellent just seals the deal. But make no mistake, the vast majority of the pieces go into this awesome jet, as it should be.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall rating: 9/10. One of the best $50 sets I&#39;ve ever&nbsp;built.&nbsp;</p>
