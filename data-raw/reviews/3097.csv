"MPH","2007-08-28T04:58:47.287Z","No necessity","Difficult to rate this one. The set is nice and colourful, the throne looks very good and King Kahuka is a cool fig. But... he is in nearly every islander set! Collect them all and you will have no less than four Kahukas (not even counting the one in US-only-set Treasure Chest). Furthermore, there is also a throne in the larger King Kahuka's Throne set.

That combined makes this set a bit useless as a part of the whole Islander range. In my opinion Lego had better made another small set with a regular islander, because now it's very difficult to build an islander army without an overwhelming abundance of Kahukas... I have tried to work around this by making the Jungle Ruler (set 5906) my main islander, so that the Kahukas can serve as a kind of officer.

All in all this set is quite nice, but certainly no must-have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-12-13T07:17:02.983Z","Ultimate Throne!","When the pirates finish fighting each other they are going to need someone else to plunder. These guys were LEGO's answer and a very nice answer indeed. As the title suggest this guy is the chief sitting on his throne. 

As per standard, the kings throne is way to big for him but in this set it has much purpose. The throne is quite colourful and fits in well with Islander ish design. It has spears and shields on the front making it look very cool and underneath is a treasure chest filled with gold coins. The chair is on a hinge so it can be easily lifted up to get to the treasure box, but is well disguised from the pirates.

The mini-fig is dressed in yellow with Islander face paint decorations and mask to match. He also has a staff decorated with a blue gem and horns. I always liked this staff and thought it was a wonderful addition to the series and the LEGO world.

Overall not a bad set, very colourful, with good aesthetics, but little playability, unless added with another set. Lots of good pieces and looks great on display. This set is also a great way to get the best of the series without lashing out and spending heaps on the bigger sets. Overall I feel this model is a 6/10 or above average. I would recommend this set to any pirate, adventure or classic collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-06T18:44:43.7Z","Classic little set","This set, from the pirates them and islanders subtheme, is like all the other old from these series, classic sets. The King Kahuka features a good designed minifigure, the king kahuka, with a mask and a staff. The throne is simple, but with awesome colors and building. On each side of the throne, are two spears and shields, fun to use for other minifigures. The building of the throne, and the set in overall is easy, and with cool pieces. The green base is also little, but useful to combine with other sets of this theme. Overall, the King Kahuka is easy to build, with awesome colors and design. But unfortunately, easy sets are sometimes not much playable, that do i rate King Kahuka 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:36:46.36Z","Not really much extra compared to other sets","This set is small, perhaps a little too small. It contains ofcourse the King Kahuka, but I agree with other reviews here: if you have this set, it's yet another Kahuka. I have this set at least two times and I agree, it seems that I have too much Kahuka's compared to regular Islanders.

But the throne is very detailed and symmetrical, in fact I think this is the most symmetrical treasure Islander set ever made.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2011-01-27T12:45:37.783Z","King Kahuka Review","<p>After Lego did the Spanish Imperial Soldiers (Blue) and then the British Imperial Soldiers (Red), the Pirates would need another direction to go with the pillaging and marading in search of plunder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In come the Islanders. They weren't bad, I was excited at first, but there was something overall in the designs of the sets that didn't appeal to me. I picked up King Kahuka easilly enough due to his price range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's one minifigure, King Kahuka, he's got a staff and his throne he sits on. There's some spears and Islander shields in the set. Under the throne is a place for his treasure to hide at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a bad set, good for the price. But there was just something about the Islander theme over all that didn't appeal to me.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-26T11:05:20.333Z","Islanders Behold Your King!","<p>Set #6236 King Kahuka: This set was introduced by LEGO as a cheaper alternative to King Kahuka's Throne, it featured a small model and the leader of the Islanders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is a small throne, the throne itself isn't built by too many unique pieces, they can be found in pretty much a lot of sets from that time. However, it does feature two Castle Spears with Islander Shields on them as a set piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The King Kahuka Mini-Figure was built with similar pieces to most Islanders, the printing was close to identical, if not identical completely. However, he featured a unique head with a full white make-up look and the unique red mask. Sad to say LEGO has not brought this piece back since those days, and I personally think they should re-visit this Sub-Theme. Or at least bring back the mask in a new style of set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this set isn't much of a must own item, the only reason to really want this set is if you wanted to be a completists of the Islanders Sub-Theme or wanted a cheap way to get more Islander Shields. I'm not too sure on how expensive it is on the secondary market, so I can't estimate how good it would be if you wanted to pick it up value wise. Still I owned this set as a child and liked it and plan on one day picking up a new version of it for my collection based purely on nostalgia alone. That being said, if you just want a King Kahuka Mini-Fig for your collection this is a great way to get one.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"phipfwe76","2011-05-25T17:21:58.3Z","Nice little set","<p>Got this set mainly for King Kahuka. It's very small, and the build is easy. Good news is it's detalied, with a treasure chest under the seat, and some decorative shields on the arms.</p>

<p>King Kahuka also comes with his mask and a nice club to hold. Decent addition to anyones island.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"markwashington","2016-12-29T22:38:34.357Z","A nice start","<p>I&#39;ve decided to go through and review all of the Islander sets as I&#39;ve just built mine up again and they&#39;re in front of me as I type, which should help me to be as informed as possible!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start by saying that the Islanders were actually known as Indigo Islanders in the UK (where I&#39;m from). I&#39;m not sure why their name was different to the US but it also meant different set names across the range. Sometimes I find that the UK names better represent the set but other times they can be a bit strange!</p>

<p>King Kahuka (or Indigo chief&#39;s throne in the UK) was the smallest set released for the Islanders theme. It consists of a strange throne, the Islander king and a treasure chest. The chest can be placed under/in the throne and the king sits on top, surveying his mighty kingdom. The throne itself is a strange, blocky and gaudy affair. It isn&#39;t aesthetically pleasing but does a good job of hiding the treasure chest which I guess was what Kahuka wanted. I&#39;m not such a fan of the throne itself but the shields are beautiful and the figure of King Kahuka is an absolute cracker. The pirate range was revolutionary when it came out in 1989 and continued to break Lego ground for the next 6-7 years (the final sets in 1997 were a sorry finale for such a great theme). The Islanders (along with Spyrius robots) were the first figures to have printed legs and while they all had the same grass skirts this was a massive development when you consider leg printing is a given today. King Kahuka&#39;s mask is brilliant and he has a lovely detailed torso print, the feather he has in his hat and the white bone piece were new this year and Lego made perfect use of them with the Islanders theme.</p>

<p>On a slightly negative note the King Kahuka figure was a bit common, appearing as he did in four of the six Islanders sets (or five of seven if you count 1788) and having him in the cheapest set meant getting him wasn&#39;t such a treat (the Soldiers governor/admiral wasn&#39;t in many sets so always felt really special).</p>

<p>In conclusion I&#39;d say this is a good starter set for the Islanders. Lego was telling a story with them and having the King and his treasure was a great addition to any Pirate collection. If you like pirates and don&#39;t own this set, go out and buy it!</p>
