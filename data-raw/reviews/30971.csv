"Lego_Lord_Mayorca","2020-11-30T16:49:42.803Z","""I Came, I Built, I Replaced the Horses...""","<p>I remember being in awe back in May 2015 when I first stepped into the Flavium Amphitheater, or Colosseum as it is better known today. Indeed, that whole day after leaving the Colosseum was spent walking in what was left of Ancient Rome, the capital of the far-flung empire that all started as a tiny village on the Tiber River.</p>

<p>With the release of the LEGO Colosseum, I was once again in awe. News and sightings of this Roman Chariot gift with purchase (GWP), however, was rather deflating. I wasn&#39;t going to buy a Colosseum right away, but as fortune would favor me, through work, I got a Roman Chariot set for free. As disdainful as I was initially for the set, I got creative and figured out something to do about it once I got to build it.</p>

<p>This was my first &quot;yellow box/picture frame&quot; set, and while I expected it to be flimsy, it was actually quite robust and the instruction booklet slotted into the front-facing side was snug. This allows for easy replacement when you are done building the set.</p>

<p>The bags are not numbered and pieces for the entire model are scattered throughout, much as it was done in LEGO System sets of olde. I personally would&#39;ve been fine with this, but I had other plans and needed to build just the chariot part first. Before that, though, came the minifigure, an approximation of a gladiator I presume. The helmet irks me for being so strongly associated with LEGO Castle, but I put my concerns aside for the time being.</p>

<p>Building the red chariot is rather simple. I loved seeing the old wagon wheels in pearl gold and while I admired the detailing on the front, it was just a bit finicky to put together. Overall, though, it was a good building experience. After I assembled the horse hitch, however, is where things took a dramatic turn. For you see, I had no intention of assembling those crude horses. Instead, I found two white horses of the old style (non-rearing hind legs) and hitched those to the chariot instead! Basically, I added the 1x1 red bricks with studs on the side into the gap on the horse, placed the red 1x2 smooth tiles on top of each one, and then proceeded to link the black studs on strings to each and to the driver. Voila! A revamped and much-improved Roman Chariot was born!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this improvement, I even felt goaded into playing with the set, gripping the horses I added to drag the charioteer along an invisible Circus Maximus. I feel doubtful I could&#39;ve done this successfully and with as much vigor if the original horses were built. The heads might have snapped off! Or the ears!</p>

<p>As it stands, this set is more like a 4 out of 5 with actual LEGO horses (new or otherwise) installed. However, with only using the pieces included in the set, this is brought down to a 3. If I ever choose to build the horses for a comparison later, I may amend this review.</p>
