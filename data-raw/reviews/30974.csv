<p>I didn&#39;t actually know what this was going to be as such - thought it might have been a buildable storage brick, but no, it&#39;s a Lego brick made of Lego with a stand, that doesn&#39;t serve any other purpose but to display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very easy build as the brick is hollow and because of this, it can&#39;t be used as a quirky paperweight.</p>

<p>Had it had hinges or studs and smooth plates on top,&nbsp;then it could have been a storage brick for smaller items.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alas, neither of these were the case, so it doesn&#39;t really serve any purpose and I&#39;d much rather use the space this would use up for a more interesting model !&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, I&#39;ll probably either use it for spare pieces or keep it for a few years before selling it on (when it&#39;s worth thousands of &pound;&pound;&pound;&pound; [NOT])&nbsp;<br />
