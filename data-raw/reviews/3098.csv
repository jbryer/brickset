Are a pirate and a soldier. The both have their different hats and design. This set is too easy to build, and is basically some small yellow plates combination with a treassure in a chest with plants and including two minifigures and their accessories. The playability is good and basic. The color scheme is also awesome and the set is sometimes cool to play, but the best to do is make a creation combining with some other lego pirates theme sets. Overall this small set is nice but with no innovations and few pieces. It still good, so i rate the pirates plunder 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It manages to narrowly avoid reducancy by offering a different mix up of minifigures in the set. A Pirate mate sporting the brown tricorne hats and one of the Red Imperial Soldiers along with a parrot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, the set still offers a cheap easy way to get ahold of Pirates for your sets, treasure chest with gold coins, accessories and a parrot this time. And once again it's value and playability comes out with its size, pricing and ability to add it to other sets to enhance and extend out play.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
