Released in January&nbsp;2021, these retail for &pound;3.49/$4.99 each and have an average of 24&nbsp;pieces each. The character we will be looking at today is Poison Mushroom&nbsp;who has 14 pieces giving a price per part of 24p/35c.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>. Let&#39;s take a look at this character and his features.</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong></p>

<p>Poison Mushroom&nbsp;is a unique character to the character bags but has been released before as a normal Super Mushroom. Poison Mushroom&nbsp;uses 8&nbsp;of the 14 pieces in the bag.</p>

<p>Poison Mushroom is built on a 2x2 tan brick that has two printed eyes which angle at the top showing some aggression, making it different to the nearly same piece used for a regular Super Mushroom. On top of this 2x2 brick is the mushroom that is a new for 2020 piece, 3x3x2 with a hollow side to attach to the stalk. This piece in purple is printed with four large dark pink circles. On top of this piece is a 2x2 stud space where the interactive tile is placed.</p>

<p>Holding the head of the Mushroom to the stalk is a small build consisting of a 1x2 jumper plate with a round tile that holds an angling plate to give the mushroom an angle on top, on top of the angle plate is a green 2x2 plate that attaches to the 2x2 anti-studs on the mushroom head.</p>

<p>Now what does the Poison Mushroom&#39;s interactive tile do?, well it&#39;s a unique effect that that goes perfectly along with the new Soda Jungle line&nbsp;of sets from Mario&nbsp;for 2021. When Mario jumps on the tile the mushroom shows on his belly as a power-up but then his eyes go all dizzy and soda bubbles go around the Mushroom on his belly. To get coins from this character you need to jump on it then shake Mario which will give him a few coins. You cannot defeat the Mushroom with any power-ups like the Star. If you don&#39;t shake him you will not get any coins.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>So with every single character in these blind bags you also get a small build to extend your courses with. This is great for anyone not wanting to buy any Mario sets for the builds but wants some of the new 4x4 rounded plates which the Poison Mushroom has in Purple, new for 2021. When Mario jumps on Purple plates he starts to fill with Soda, just shake Mario to get some coins if you don&#39;t then nothing really happens.</p>

<p>On the Purple plate are a couple small things such as a small stump to place the Mushroom on, this is just made using a 2x2 round brick and 2x2 round jumper tile in brown. Next to that is a brown 1x1 round tile printed with a wooden log top, a fairly uncommon print. Finally, there is a light green leaf piece with a 1x1 flower stud in Salmon pink.</p>

<p>Each blind bag also includes extra parts which is great, this set has a 1x1 round tile in pink, a brown 1x1 round tile printed with the wooden log top and a Salmon Pink flower stud.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This was my first buy from this series and I have no regret, despite having the lowest piece count out of all the 20 Mario Character released in the two Blind Bag Series the Mushroom has a lot to offer with his interactive features. The figure has a nice selection pieces and the in game feature is a nice little add on to any course. Though I do feel as if the build to sit the Mushroom on could have had a bit more detail added.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Great build and pieces, amazing unique interactive feature, cheap way to get new pieces</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>The build could have had a few more pieces added to make it more substantial like other Characters in the series have.</p>
