Construction is good.  Areas for improvement: 1. Instructions had numerous errors and color reproduction was poor.  2. Retractable legs would have been nice.  3. Some details in the interior would have been desirable.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Being a space geek I just had to have one. This is a subperb model and remarkably accurate when compared to the original. A few compromises have had to be made but basiscally it looks like what it is supposed to be - an Apollo lunar module. Just like the real thing it is in 2 parts the lower octagonal decsent stage (which is cleverly done using hinge bricks) and the upper oddly shapped ascent stage. Colours and stickers are also authentic. In order for the minifigs to fit inside the front hatch an window detail is not so accurate. I feel this is a bit of a let down, and decided I would rather have mine looking more accurate and modified the front to recreate the distinctive angular windows of the original. The minifigs can no longer fit inside, but can be placed outside climbing down the ladder or &quot;on the surface&quot;. I have also built a lunar rover (used in later missions) and various surface experiments to complement the set - visitors have been suitably impressed. A very accurate representation of a piece of history and well worth the money. It's only a 9 due to the inaccurate hatch/window arrangement.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's well done although i suppose it is more of a 'display' model than a 'play' model, but it's good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get two astronauts, the Lunar Lander, and a cool American flag but comes as a sticker, which is annoying. This is a set that should be owned by Lego fans and history buffs.
