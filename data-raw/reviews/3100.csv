The sentry tower is quite good and could be easily be converted to a gatehouse for a fortess and the rowboat is a nice addition. I would have gave this set a 10/10 if it had one or two more Spanish soldiers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-01T20:37:12.81Z","Armada Sentry","This is a small set, one of the small sets of the pirates theme. Released in 1996, this is like some other, simple but nicely builted. With a good design, this set includes a soldier minifigure with some simple details and colors on th classic lego style. The set involves some building like the base above the blue plate. The base is basically a gate with some increasings like the good builted walls. A feature is the cord above it, that can hold other pieces like the barrel. The small plates that built the set are all useful and the building, in comparison with the size is good. The boat is also simple but includes some other useful pieces, like the treasure chest. The minifigure stay very well in the boat, that uses some pieces to increase inside it. The building, design and color scheme/details are very simple. Altough this is a simple small set, this have a good playability that with the cord makes it better and also the pieces are useful. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set was one of the first to contain the new Armada figures as the Imperial Soldiers were phased out nearing the end of the pirates' initial run in the late 90's. The figure itself is very nicely designed and the helmet looks very good. You can add a plume if you have extras.

Number of Figures: 10/10
I feel that as long as you get at least 1 figure for every $10 spent on a set then you are getting ""fair value"" and as such I have no reason to dock points here.

Features: 5/10
Not a lot going on here. There's a small crane that you can move up and down (no winch) and doors that swing out. The interior of the lookout is empty.

Accessories: 7/10
Many of the typical pirate pieces come with this set. There's a dinghy, the small wooden doors, and a barrel with four treasure pieces. The sentry gets a cutlass and musket.

Build: 7/10
Small set, not difficult, but not a lot of ""juniorized"" pieces to complain about. The set is obviously very simple.

Logic: 5/10
Having the small dock to load/unload accessories off the dinghy is nice and the ladder leading to the lookout perch is a good detail to not omit. I don't see any purpose in having doors that lead directly into the sea though. Too many drunk figs falling into the water perhaps?

Uniqueness: 7/10
There really isn't anything in this set to distinguish itself from the other small ports that were released in the pirate line, but this set does get a couple bonus points for being the only set to have green wooden doors.

Nostalgia: 5/10
My own personal category so I can give a set extra points if it has some special meaning for me. In this case I only got this set several years ago. No bonus nostalgia points.

Miscellaneous: 1/10
My biggest complaint isn't with the set itself, rather that this is the base of operations for the entire Imperial Armada. There was no larger land set for this incarnation of the 'good guys.' Don't even bother sending the Skull's Eye Schooner to take over this port, the Cross Bone Clipper and its three man crew could do it with ease. It's easy to see why the Armada didn't last longer with its lack of fortified ports.

Overall Feeling: 5/10
This set is decent, but there is nothing about it that really stands out. It has some flaws as mentioned earlier, but it does look nice and I cannot complain about adding to my Armada army and they never were really released in abundance. I recommend it for the pirate collector, not so much for anyone else.

It's very good pieces in this set, and if you want to start with Lego Pirates this is an nice set. It has an cool baseplate, and since lego stop make these is very rare. The coins is very nice and all the weapon too. 3/5",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"albcheng123","2010-01-12T00:03:24.92Z","The only but nice outpost for the Armada","The Spanish (or Portugese) Armada Flagship (6280) may need a small outpost for supply or observing the activities of the pirates, and this set may do its function.

The sets is a small pier built on a ""Blue 8 x 16 baseplate"" with a small building which serves as a small military sentry and small cargo storage.

However, the outpost may be too small if it is the only land-based set for the Armada (I just wonder where can the Armada Flagship park after long voyage across the Atlantic). 

Anyway, it should be a decent nice set........


Pros:
- Nice ""small outpost"" design which serves as  a pier, small sentry, cargo storage, & small crane with 71 bricks
- Some nice bricks (green doors, white fence, 2 white wall panels, red boat, armada minifigs, gold coins)
- Brown barrel, a string (with end studs) and ""Hinge Plates"" constructs a small crane system
- Reasonable fun for a small set

Cons:
- Too small as the only outpost for the Armada
- One more minifig (either Armada or pirates) may offer even more fun
- The green doors are too close to the ocean (the officer may easily fall into the sea)

You get a red boat with 2 green seats and 2 brown paddles. The boat is big enough for 4 minifigs in total. The dock is nice and there's a brown ladder which leads to the small balcony. On the balcony is a small crane which has a rope and at the end of the rope is a barrel with 4 gold coints in it. If you want you can use this crane and the barrel as a booby trap if the minifig is opening the green doors. On the one side of the entrance is a nice flag and on the other side where the dock is you can see a lantern. The whole building is on a blue base plate which makes this small set really awsome. If you want to build a harbor for the British soldiers you'll need to get this set. The only thing I might have to complain about is that there's no door which leads to the dock.

"Ernst","2012-05-16T18:04:59.03Z","Lovely little set, the only Armada building.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : Although very small a set I really like, great litlle building with a very good color scheme and a wonderfull minifigure, a winch, treasurebox and rowboat. The 2 Armada sets, this one and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6280-1"">The Armada Flagship</a>, have in my opinion the best minifigures of the whole Pirate theme. I can only guess why Lego never brought out more Armada sets, really a shame. This small building with the characteristic green doors and studs deserved a bigger family. I personally consider it a Pirates collectors item and a challenge for MOC builders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : Not a difficult set to built but fun to do. The set is based on a black scaffold, the little outpost is mainly formed by the 2 big white walls. On the top floor a small winch and a fence, nothing really spectacular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : Best parts are first the Imperial Armada soldier and the 2 green doors and round studs. Not the shape of the bricks but the colour make it great parts, the color also returns again in the boat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : Because of the lack of another Armada soldier or a Pirate not really much playing possibilities. You defenitly have to add another minifigure (preferable a pirate) for some playing fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : Average price according to <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6244-1"">Bricklink</a> some €11,00 which is fine for me. Including sending costs I paid one euro more which i did not mind, not an easy set to find. I wouldn't be surprised if the average price would rise to some €15,00 at least.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
