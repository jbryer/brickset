<p>The bone goomba is a nice variant of a character whose default form has appeared in sets and the first two blind bag series in which this character comes from .</p>

<p>The character -</p>

<p>The bone goomba is built on the super Mario leg piece in teele , with two 1&times;3 teele jumpers ontop with one of them having subtle side printing for the teeth , the main head is built out of two snot pieces with a printed 1&times;2 tile for the face , a 2&times;2 slope in white on each side a 2&times;2 unprinted white tile at the back and the factory applied sticker ontop where Mario scans him or her .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the 4&times;4 Mario stand in red with a 2&times;2 round plate in&nbsp; dark grey with two 1&times;2 dark grey masonry bricks and a jumper ontop for the perch in which the goomba sits , the stand also has a 1&times;1 round light grey tile and two flame builds using the candle piece ontop introduced with Harry potter in 2018 .</p>

<p>In conclusion -&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is a pretty good character , the common nature of goombas in the super Mario theme is a well know fact so it is great to get some sort of variation other than a parachute and a pair of wings , and a non nintendo/ Mario or just gaming in general enthusiast like myself and I like this variation there must be something there for other non gamer Lego fans so I recommend it .</p>
