"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T11:19:52Z","Neat little launch","I probably would have given this set an 8 except that it and Buried Treasure were I believe the first pirate sets I ever got. Obviously, the lieutenant (or ensign or whatever) couldn't actually fire the cannon while in the rowboat, he could be going to reinforce Saber Island or bringing it to the Caribbean Clipper. Still a fun set that came with a flag as well. I liked the French soldiers more than the English (Imperial guard) ones just because blue is my favorite color.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-20T13:05:55Z","Good little set","This set has lots of playability for a child,yet not really a collecter's item.
Pros:
You get a cannon,a flag,and a red boat
Cons:why in the world is a cannon armed on a row boat,if the officer fires it he will drown plus how can the boat not sink due to the cannon's weight?!?!?
Also why is a OFFICER rowing the boat to his demise?They should have put an imperial soldier instead.I think maybe a harbor partrol should have been made that includes two imperial soldiers and a red rowboat with a flag.Overall 8/10 P.S you can still find this for around orignal retail value on ebay.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

On it's own, this set will provide hours of entertainment, but the parts it's made of - especially the highly expandable boat - will last a lifetime.

"Rubberducky","2006-05-13T05:52:01Z","Sweet little set","I like this set but it could be better. i like how the cannon can move but the flag stops it from going 360 degrees around. i like how there is a pistol and cutlass for the man to use if the pirates get to him. what i dont like about the set if that its abit incorrect, the cannon would of completely sunk the boat and if he did fire the cannon then it would tear his little boat apart. but this is lego and i like this set non the less. i think that this set would be the one that stays behind the battle and acts like artillery.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-07T05:00:22.05Z","Weird set, good parts","Interesting set, this harbor sentry. The unique soldier (indeed only in this set) looks like he's just one rank below Governor Broadside, yet has to do some torturing slavory labour in his little rowboat carrying that huge cannon. Argh! The parts of this set are superb however. As noted we get a unique minifig, and on top of that a rowboat with soldier flag and a BROWN cannon. Not many sets have them and since I want my pirates to have their cannons in a different color than my soldiers, owning a few harbor sentries is a must.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"zek","2008-03-27T01:27:34.75Z","Super set","For a small set this one packs a big punch. It comes with a few rare pieces like the boat and the cannon. I have to say the cannon is awsome and fires well and fun to play with. The minifig is neat and the overall design of the boat is geat for its size and age. This set will make a grast addition to a pirate navy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-28T04:17:36.827Z","Move Your Boat! or Get Blown Up!","Wanted to review another pirates set so pulled this one out and finished building it. The set is very basic and what you see is what you get. The boat is a standard red boat equiped with one seat, a cannon and six cannonballs. The cannon is quite cool as it actually launches the little cylinders over two meters away. The base of the cannon is brown and has space for the pirates gun and cutlass to clip on the side. The flag is blue with a big white cross and a small black symbol in the middle that looks similar to a bird.

The pirate is unique to this set but can be found identical with a different hat in other sets. He is dressed in white pants, fancy white and blue top, fancy yellow shoulder pads. His hat is just like the pirate captains without the skull and cross bones. Long and thin, with a place for a feather and all black. His face is a smile with red fringe, beard and moustache. He also has a pair of brown oars to get himself around.

Overall a simple but effective set. It obviously works allot better when added in with another boat or pirate set but you get this from most small, cheap sets. This set is very aesthetically appealing and thus why so many people have it. I feel this model is a 5/10 or Average but is an excellent way to get into the pirate theme if you aren't already there and a nice one to add to your collection if you are. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jbogosh10","2007-09-21T17:04:22.03Z","Great Set","This set was a nice add on when playing with other sets.  
I think Lego was still playing around with the ideas of the different pirate figs, kinda like the Clipper with the 'sailors' that didn't catch on in any other Soldier/Imperial boat.
The only problem I see with this set is the fact that the weight of the cannon would not equal out the weight of the Sentry!  But the kick back of the cannon probably would make the boat go faster than rowing it!  This would have been the first motor boat!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-19T19:28:26.983Z","He pulls a good oar","Well conceived introduction to the pirate theme. The cannon certainly packs a fine punch with respect to the appeal of this set. The unique minifigure, in hindsight, turned out to be a nice treat aswell.

Whatever this set is trying to portray, it's not an harbor sentry. Our brave little sailor is most likely a rear-admiral, or a captain at least. After his ship was boarded by pirates, his crew slain and he, himself was taken prisoner to be hold for ransom; he broke free out of his prison, singlehandedly burned the pirate's nest to the ground and managed to escape with one of their cannons as war-booty. And now, after this ordeal, this old war-horse is confidently rowing towards the nearest friendly port...

This set may be lacking when it comes to creative building, but it makes up for it, by giving a boost to inventive storytelling. Wouldn't you think?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-09T17:08:04.547Z","Nice small set","This set, like some others from the pirates theme, is a small but with useful pieces. The figure, is simple and good designed, with a classic style. The boat also includes some black pieces on the floor, to the figure sit on, and it works very well. Another feature is the classic format of the hat and the cannon, that is used also on other pirates sets, in boats, ships or fortresses. The set is also playable and with good space to more one figure, or two, if you not use the cannon on it. Overall, the set is great, but with not much fun, due to playability and few pieces.

"Nikola_Bathory","2008-03-25T04:55:36.263Z","NIce little set","Time for my first review!
 This is a very good little set (I even have 2!). You get a boat and a cannon, which is enough for fun and playability, I think. And an officer, who I think is more rare important than a simple soldier.
 I remember that I had fun playing with the cannons, when you have several sets with cannons you can have epic battles!
So, this is a cool little set, with nothing to build (the only downside).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-09-17T16:42:41.593Z","Nice addition but not the most real one","I must agree with some of the other reviews here. Allthough it's a nice addition to any armada, it's not the most realistic one. First of all, ofcourse the little boat would sink. Second, if it were to be used it would probably tear the little boat apart. And third, the strangely dressed officer does have a slavery mission. It should have been a regular soldier, or it should have been a very light slightly larger escort vessel to accompany the Carribean Clipper (no 6274). But on the other hand, suppose the soldier disembarks his cannon, then it would be more real. I'm not sure if I have this set or not, I believe I do have it. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"destroydacre","2009-06-21T20:49:04.187Z","Man Overboard!","Figures: 10/10
This set comes with one of the original 'bluecoat' Imperial Soldiers. He is similar to the lieutenant that comes with most of the sets, but he has a bicorne hat instead of a tricorne.

Number of Figures: 10/10
Any more and you would run out of space really fast.

Features: 6/10
The major piece is this set is undoubtedly the cannon. The set I purchased came with one of the black pinned ""thump"" cannons. It works but not nearly as well as the spring action cannons.

Accessories: 7/10
There are 2 oars to row the boat, plus a pistol and cutlass for the soldier to defend himself should he run into any pirates. There are also 6 black cannon balls for the cannon.

Build: 5/10
Extremely simple set, takes about a minute to put together.

Logic: 6/10
I really don't think that this was a common way to transport cannons back in the 17th/18th centuries, but I don't think it's out of the question if there are extreme circumstances. However, the fact that the cannon can swivel leads me to believe that this dinghy is supposed to patrol and attack if it encounters any opposition. I don't think repeatedly firing a cannon in a boat of this size would be a very good idea. Otherwise this boat has all the features needed to get around.

Uniqueness: 8/10
As far as dinghies go, this was the only one in the original line to have its own cannon. This set also was one of the few to have the pure black bicorne hat.

Nostalgia: 10/10
This was the first set that I ever had that contained a cannon, and the only 'firing' cannon that I had growing up. When I was younger, this was one of the coolest things ever.

Miscellaneous: 8/10
This set actually looks pretty cool and if you get 3 or 4 of these, you have a nice little patrol for your forts.

Overall: 9/10
This set is one of my favorite small sets from the Imperial Soldiers' line. It has the one flaw, but aside from that looks good and proudly boasts the Soldiers' flag. A decent set to add to your collection for sure.

"MetroiD","2009-01-11T08:36:45.53Z","Classic","It's a small set, in which you get a minifig, a gun, a sword, a boat with rowing pads and flag and a cannon with cannonballs. Now really, at that price, what more could you ask for, especially back in 1989!?!

In all honesty, this one was actually my first LEGO set ever, I was 4 years old and from that point on, I was hooked for life. Fair enough, it is not my most favourite small LEGO set ever, but it still is a very good one. So what if it's not realistic, so what if in reality the boat would rip to pieces if that cannon was used on it!? It's LEGO world people, lighten up!

In 1992 this set was replaced by the same boat, albeit with 3 minifigs on board /all armada figs/ and a treasure chest. Which was hardly an improvement the way I saw it.

The naval blue was highly suitable making them a navy of your choosing, the later red coats seeming more like an army apart from those horrible blue shoulder tassels. Here the yellow/gold shoulder decoration is shown, a brilliant colour combination with smart white britches. A surprisingly featherless (why?) splendid admiral style arched hat adorns the MF's bonce that has among the first brown/ginger beard print, a seafarer look.&nbsp;The Pirates theme armed most pirates and naval crew to the teeth. Here he gets a blunderbuss pistol and a cutlass/sabre sword.&nbsp;</div><div><br><div><b>Destroyer Class Dinghy</b></div><div>Even as a kid you realised that the rowing boat would unlikely withstand the repeated recoil of a ship grade cannon but then it did make it that much more amusing and fun. This set was also named simply 'Admiral Broadside'. An error really as once you got the fort it seems that this character is more the second in command officer, a less decorated captain perhaps.&nbsp;A quick stroke with one of the two oars allows him to bring the large cannon round to bare but it can be turned more quickly. The barrel clips in to the mount and sits on a strong chunky turntable, so it can pointed 360º at any time.&nbsp;This big gun gets a few cannonball shots, a satisfying use of the one stud black cylinder bricks.&nbsp;These ingenious two piece devices had one of the most simple and effective small firing devices we ever found in a toy, putting Hasbro's Transformers to shame for their limp spring misfire-and-crumble launchers.&nbsp;Two way battles were fun, allowing for critical hits on MFs or for scoring damage on ships and buildings. The one piece red rowing boat is not going to win many awards for building experience or design in bricks. It seems however to have been a clever payoff that diminished little popularity plus you could gently try and float it, a feature that all the ship designs could have tried to incorporate. A small bench furthers the minimal constructive element in this mere 25 brick set! Sitting on this rowing, the officer can tidily clip the sword and pistol in to the cannon mount and set off, a fleur-de-lys and crossed naval flag clipped on to an aerial piece, flying from the back of the boat.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Invention Of The Minifigure Gun</b></div><div>Some of us were told that Lego never intended to make guns but the historical Pirates theme changed that. The early end of the Pirates theme had better sets than more regular Town and City themes, they can probably always return with success. The theme also introduced a broad supply of much craved for brown bricks. Despite the lack of build this set will, like many Pirates sets, score highly because they were often so well designed and consistent.
