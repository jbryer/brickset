She has her fiery red hair, the&nbsp;head that is normally used for Mia, a purple patterned torso, and muted green cargo shorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The second mini doll is Ava. Ava is one of the new micro dolls. Everything is new except her&nbsp;hair. Ava has a blue dress, a head with big green eyes, and two orange pigtails.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>First we start by building a table, two pink chairs that we add stickers to, a sandwich, and a sign. Lastly we build a smoothie bike. There is some NPU (nice parts usage) by making the smoothies with the collectible minifigure stand piece.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>In bag two we get a mini doll called Marcel. Marcel is a male adult mini doll. He has dark blue pants, a plaid blazer with bow tie, an older looking face and&nbsp;partially bald hair piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cafe has four sections (in my opinion). From left to right there is a small area with a coffee machine and a cash register, the main eating area with one table and seat, the kitchen with a microwave, cutting board, and lots of ingredients, and the garden with cherries growing vertically&nbsp;and carrots growing from a raised garden.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really&nbsp;enjoyed making this set. I wish themes like city had buildings like this which is why I appreciate the friends theme.</p>

<p>I have some complaints about the set though:</p>

<p>-I wish that the coffee machine was not black because it&nbsp;looks out of place.</p>

<p>-cherries grow from trees and do not hang like they do in the set.</p>

<p>-I would have liked to see at least a sink to have in the kitchen besides the microwave there are not many appliances.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am happy to see kids and older characters being introduced.&nbsp;The color scheme fits really well in the cafe. &nbsp;Overall I recommend buying this set.</p>
