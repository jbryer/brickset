Not only did it not come with a crocodile and island man, it cam with an ingeniuosly designed jail with a peg-legged pirate! So not only a started for the Islanders range, also for the whole pirates theme! And at a low price!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I'm 19 now and I've lost everything but the torso of the island guy, the torso of the pirate, the bow &amp; arrow (broken now), the lid, the bottom green plate, the grey side pieces, and one javelin.

It was a lot of fun. If I could find this, I'd buy it in a second. Ah, the memories.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-24T18:39:06Z","i would imagine a regular version would be awesome...","by that i mean that when i bought it off ebay, i didnt know that the seller was in china. FREAKIN' CHINA, MAN!! he sent me the wrong item, and, as a consolation prize, when he sent me the 3 bonus sets (Skeleton Crew, Treasure Surprise, Shipwrecked Pirate). however, these sets were wierd Chinese versions:
Pros:
all cutlasses are SILVER!
some striped shirt bodies/torsos have red SLEEVES!
coins are more realistic, have no Lego logo on the back, and are BRONZE!
Skeleton Crew came with a red transparent CUP!
the skeleton had no TOES!
the crocodile's eyes pop OUT!
cons:
heads are wierd and don't work as well with normal hats
hats only work really well with the wierd heads
Crocodile Cage's Islander's hairpiece doesnt stay on his head
the shield is really really wierd",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-17T05:05:31.41Z","My first islander set","I used to like the pirate-vs-soldier battles and therefor didn't really care for the islander line when it was released back in 1994. However, this set was in a small lego collection I took over recently and it opened my eyes. Islanders are cool! And for a small set this is very, very good - like many small pirate sets.

The jail cell looks awesome and as far as I know is the only one in the islander line. (Which is probably OK; I guess most pirates end up in the cooking pot before they are enprisoned anyway.) The little bush, fireplace and totempole-like-thingy fit in perfectly and make for a fully stuffed island. The minifigs are great and also getting a crocodile and parrot gives you dozens of playing possibilities. I love this one...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-27T17:04:45.59Z","The Crocodile Cage","This set is one small set of the pirates theme ad was released in the year of 1994, like other sets of the islanders subtheme. Like some other sets of the islanders, this small set includes a green plate under the building. This set includes two minifigures, one is a islander, nicely designed, good coloured and still in the classic lego style, like the pirate minifigure, that is also nice. The set also includes itens like the pirate's hat and the islander's shield and longbow. In the set also are included a minifigure of a crocodile, that is the same of other lego crocodiles, simple designed, no much playable but cool. The minifigure of the macaw is just a solid piece with no playability, but is also simple, nice and useful for more sets. The cage is made with some useful pieces that makes three walls and also with spears that makes the gate. The minifigure stay very well in it, the cage have a good size. In the side of the cage, above the green plate, there is a spear with some other pieces increasing it, to looks like more a torch or a statue that have on the top, a piece that looks like be a bone of an animal, also found on the islander's hair. In playaility, this set is good, the gate of the cage works very well and the playability is basic, due to the size. So, overall, this set is a great option to the Lego fans that are searching for old cool lego sets. I rate the &quot;Crocodile Cage&quot; 5/5  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Little, but full of everything this set includes an islander and a pirate with wood leg, a prison, crocodile, parrot, and lots weapons.
This set is very beautiful and playable.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:32:39.297Z","First islander set","This was my first Islanders set and I still love it. The cage construction with the rotating door is just brilliant, it has a very nice atmosphere. The green crocodile is the pet of the guardian and the fire place makes it very comfortable for both of them. Also the totem pole and the bush on the small but nice green platter makes this set truly amazing. The islander figure is well equiped with both arrow+bowholder+shield. The pirate has a wooden leg I believe and has a nice outfit. The parrot and the decoration on top of the cage makes this set lovely and a nice beginners set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-25T08:25:11.327Z","An Islander Arrives","<p>Set #6246 Crocodile Cage: If you were interested in the Pirates Theme from LEGO back in the day and couldn't afford any of the mighty sailing vessels, these types of sets are what you were left with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crocodile Cage is a small prison model released as part of the Islanders Theme, it featured one Islander, a Pirate prisoner and a Crocodile. The model itself isn't that big of a deal, although it is nice that instead of using iron bar pieces you build the prison with spears from LEGO Castle. It means you can have a lot of extra weapons that turn quickly into a convenient little cell for your prisoner. Going from the picture on the box, since my memory is drawing a blank on this set, it also looks to me as though it had a gimmic where you&nbsp;raised the spears by pulling a lever off to the side of the cage, built using the Pirate prisoners gun as the handle so his mateys could free him. (Hope I'm right about that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures featured some pretty basic prints, but the Islanders were all damn impressive, even for simple yet elegant prints. They are, to this date, also extremely rare as LEGO has not brought back this type of Mini-Fig in any other sets. The Crocodile was an excellent new animal piece as well, and this set was one of the cheapest that offered it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I would say this little Crocodile Cage is a good addition to your Pirates Collection, as it includes some nice pieces, a good selection of weapons and a fun little model to fiddle with for MOCers. I kind of wish though that LEGO would have introduced a new weapon piece for the Islanders to use rather than relying on the old Castle weapons. A blowgun perhaps would have been more useful, though I suppose that's what MOCing is all about. I love those shields though and wish LEGO would make a new Pirates Theme and bring back the Islanders.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"markwashington","2016-12-29T22:56:44.353Z","Absolute classic.","<p>Crocodile Cage (or Crocodile prison in the UK) was the second smallest Islanders set that Lego released. The 1994 UK Lego catalogue said this about it &quot;To keep the marauding Pirates from stealing the Indigo tribe&#39;s treasure&quot;. Not a bad description!</p>

<p>It consists of a small prison and an area where it appears an islander can wait while he guards his prisoner. This is the smallest set to contain the generic islander figure and he is very well equipped with a bow, arrows and a shield, obviously they were serious about not letting the pirates escape!</p>

<p>The set is called Crocodile Cage not because the cage is for crocodiles but because it comes with a crocodile. Now I&#39;m not a fan of Lego animals (sharks, monkeys, parrots etc) so I&#39;ll just say that it was good to get a crocodile with a smaller set but it does nothing for me, sorry.</p>

<p>The cage comes on a small baseplate and is perfectly formed. I love the use of spears for the bars and the way the pirate sits inside is brilliant. The spiky shrub is a great addition and the totem pole type thing gives the set a complete feel. The pirate has a peg leg and the weapons (blunderbuss and sword) he was presumably found with are included in the set.</p>

<p>Overall this is probably my favourite Islanders set. You get the best (IMO) Islander figure, a shield, a crocodile (make of that what you will) and a bone/feather wheel to adorn the scene. I would reccommend that you go out and buy this set if you&#39;re a Pirate fan because it stands alone as a real cracker. A must have in any collection!</p>
