<p>Extra dots series 3 is most revolutionary set to come out since the 2018 Harry potter CMF series .</p>

<p>The parts-</p>

<p>The pieces include like the previous series&#39; 10 surprise charms but once again you get more than ten , I personally got , &times;1 explosion , &times;1 sleeping dog , &times;1 BFF heart , &times;3&nbsp;unlocked pad locks , &times;1 glass ball , &times;1 speech bubble ,&times;1 locked pad lock and &times;2 cats and all of these are prints on 1&times;1 white tiles . The other pieces included are some dark azure corner tiles , light aqua corner tiles , some purple corner tiles and some 1&times;1 trans pink round tiles ,BUT this set also includes DUAL MOULDED TILES , yes you heard me correct dual moulded tiles these are revolutionary there are some 1&times;1 lavender round tiles with a trans pink star emerging from it with the trans pink visible from underneath and there are some 1&times;1 dark blue tiles with a glittery trans clear diamond poking out with that colour visible from underneath as well , and there are 9 of each included .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this set in my eyes is a must have for any Lego fan as these pieces are just amazing and nothing as revolutionary has come out of Lego since 2018 with mid legs in the Harry Potter CMF series so I highly recommend this and it is probably the best out of all three series as I do own all three .&nbsp;</p>

The new dual molded tiles are incredible, and you get a lot of them. They consist of normal tiles with what looks to be almost a hole drilled out where a gem has been put.&nbsp;There are 2 kinds, one with a pink star-gem in the center of a 1x1 round tile, and one with a diamond shaped gem on a dark blue 1x1 tile. They look fabulous, and add a nice pop. Of course, you also get some normal tiles and printed tiles, which are nice inclusions as well. Some nice tones, although I do wish the curved 1x1 tiles were in normal blue.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say that this is a great buy if only to add the parts to your collection.&nbsp;With over 100 pieces for only 4 bucks, it&#39;s a great deal.</p>

"Padmewan","2021-10-28T15:36:50.837Z","Most innovative Dots pack","<p>If you get any Dots set, get this one. There are two exclusive pieces that break new ground for Lego: a 3D diamond attached to a square dark blue tile, and a 3D star attached to a pink round tile. Both of the pieces create unique decorative opportunities for Dots projects or any MOC. It&#39;s a new way to greeble!</p>

<p>The set also comes with the usual assortment of unprinted 1x1 tiles, in a very coherent color palette. But it ALSO comes with printed tiles that are cute and also potentially useful -- a few can easily be slipped into a scene as part of a sign or poster.</p>

<p>The fact that this pack comes with BOTH the printed tiles AND the 3D tiles significantly raises its value above the rest of the Extra Dots line. It&#39;s an easy recommend even at its full retail price.</p>
