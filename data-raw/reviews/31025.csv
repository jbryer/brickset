"ggauge","2021-01-11T02:25:35.637Z","Lifelike Bouquet of Flowers ","<p>On Sunday,&nbsp;the wife and I built #10280 Flower Bouquet, and she is amazed how life like the set turned out. I must admit that I am also very happy with the design for each flower in the set.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Box: The black color choice for the box is fantastic. The colorful&nbsp;bouquet pops to life and you almost will believe that they are real. The box had the finger punch flaps and some glue on the inside which was very disappointing due to the fact that we keep the empty boxes just incase I want to disassemble the set. Having the box taped allows for it to stand upright without any support if needed. I used a letter opener to avoid damaging the box.</p>

<p>Instruction book: The&nbsp;wife did not like the at all. She said that the paper color&nbsp;choice is total wrong and made it very difficult for her to see the parts clearly. I also concur with her thinking about it. She had to use the online building instructions to help her out. As far as she is concerned, this is a fairly clear mistake on Lego design. Our book has black pages instead of the normal white pages.</p>

<p>Build: Many clever building techniques,&nbsp;new parts and new colors for many parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final impression: We highly recommend this set to everyone that enjoys Lego as well as having a vase full of flowers in their house. Our neighbours were&nbsp;over this morning and as we were sitting around the table drinking coffee,&nbsp;they did not notice that the bouquet was Lego until I pointed it out to them. They were very impressed and could not believe that they were made of Lego bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nicely done Lego.<br />

<p>Bell&#39;aspetto, divertenti da costruire (anche se alcuni fiori, come la Lavanda, sono un po&#39; delicati)</p>

<p>Interessante che sul libretto delle istruzioni venga specificato l&#39;origine dei pezzi usati.</p>

<p>Molto consigliato</p>

"MyLegoverse","2022-11-12T13:04:36.133Z","Nice Decoration set","<p>Hello Everybody,</p>

<p>Today I&#39;m going to check out the Lego 10280 Flower Bouquet from the Botanical Collection. I was lucky to find it on sale, so I was tempted to buy it for my girlfriend. Since she is always complaining about my Star Wars or Super Heroes purchases.</p>

<p>This one we can expose everywhere in the house, and it can fit every style of home. I consider this box as medium size, it has 756 pieces and is targeting 18+. The design of the box is, I believe, as usual neat(I am a weak Lego fan, so for me, they rarely miss the design of the box). I just can&rsquo;t help myself, they are always amazing in my eyes. I have high expectations for this one since the number of pieces is high, but there are also a lot of details and small pieces.</p>

<p>So as a result, the count is likely to get lost in the big picture. As far as I can see, there are like 15 plants. So it should be a nice little bouquet. And I hope it&rsquo;s going to fit with the vase I bought specially for this one.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>

<p>The instruction book does not look very thick, so I guess that we have my least favourite part of a Lego build: the &quot;x2&quot; and &quot;x3&quot; when you must assemble the same construction multiple times.</p>

<p>What I love in the book is the introduction you have for each flower, the name, the description, and much more.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to spoil you; you should discover it for yourself.</p>

<p>There are four parts: part 1 has two bags, part 2 has two bags, part 3 has one bag, and part 4 is the special bag with the long cross axles. There are a total of 15 plants to build.</p>

<p>In the first bag, we have two Common Daisies and three Roses.</p>

<p>The two Daisies are quite simply made, no special techniques were used, and the result is pretty nice. The Roses are just a little more complicated. I loved the way they used car parts to make the petals, and the wings of a dinosaur to make the leaves. The result is great!</p>

<p>In the second bag, we have one California Poppy, two Snapdragons, and two types of grass plants.</p>

<p>The California Poppy is, like the Daisies, very simple. Though, it does not take anything from the beauty and the realness of the flower. The Snapdragon flower is more complicated and repetitive to make, but the result is awesome. I suppose it was difficult to replicate the real size and shape of the flower.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think it is a simple way to stay true to the real flower. The Snapdragon is my favourite flower from this set.</p>

<p>At last, the two grass-type plants are nothing special. They are made from two bushes on top of each other.</p>

<p>The third bag contains Lavender, an Aster, and three leafy plants. For the Lavender, a quite simple technique was used, and a very repetitive one. It took nine times to make the little flowers and assemble them.</p>

<p>The Aster flower is also very repetitive to build,</p>

<p>And it does not look like a real one, at least not the ones, I have seen. I guess, there are a lot of different species out there.</p>

<p>But it brings a new colour to the bouquet, so when everything is put together, it is very pretty.</p>

<p>The leafy plants are also easy to build and made with a few elements, I like the way they have used surfboards to finish the leaves at the top.</p>

<p>The different green grass plants from the second and third bags are, as already written, very easily made and nothing special. In my opinion, it was most likely a cheap way for TLG to make the bouquet appear larger for a lower price. But, with that in mind, they do make an excellent addition to the bouquet!</p>

<p>Another thing that I noticed was that they had added some fun facts down on the pages, which are amazing to read.</p>

<p>They give us some extra information about the pieces we are using.</p>

<p>Bottom line: If you like decorations and lifestyle items then buy this set on sale, it will most likely fit in every home. And yes, it is a very beautiful set and easy to build. I&#39;m not sure how long it took to complete, but I would say that in an hour of speed-building,</p>

<p>it is possible to do.</p>

<p>I guess the new strategy from TLG, about the age notification on the boxes, is a guide for who can enjoy the set, and not for which age is recommended to build it.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t been following the teasers over the last few days, I&#39;ll probably update a few videos and photos on my social media accounts. Don&#39;t forget to follow for more content.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;finding a vase to put them in we had them sitting on a coffee table. Anytime the table was bumped several of the small purple or pink flowers would just fall off. Ended up having to move it to a higher location that is not as visible.</p>

<p>Do no recommend having within reach of young children or pets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish that it would have come with a vase to build and put them into. I&#39;ll have to make one on my own. It just doesn&#39;t look right having the lego flowers in a glass vase. Finding one that is tall enough and has the right size mouth (opening) to support the flowers in the arrangement you want can be difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this reason I marked the price value lower.&nbsp;</p>
