<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The World Map has a large box in which the top comes off to reveal a tray with the parts, similar to an iPhone box. Inside this tray comes many bags of 1x1 round tiles, a large rectangular box with the 40 large technic bricks, and another smaller box with the parts for the border. The instructions are pretty standard, but thin for a set of this size. Although it is to be expected since it is an Art set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>What can I say? Most of these are 1x1 round tiles, with some white bricks for the base. There are a variety of colours for these tiles and I love the ones they chose. I like the teal especially, which is not in many other sets. The white studs happen to be the largest single piece count in any set at 3,064 of the same piece, not including the extras. I also like the technic bases, of which there are 40. The set also includes the monstrous black brick separator and a gold crowbar to also act as one. The last notable pieces are the technic blocks with cutouts for hanging it up. I find these really interesting, although they are only intended for hanging things up.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>There are no minifigures in this set.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was tedious, to say the least. Thankfully, LEGO provides a podcast to listen to while you build it. For me, though, I did not listen to that, but instead I watched a lot of YouTube videos and TV shows. Since the build is relatively easy, it took me only about ten hours over the span of a week. Despite the repetitiveness, I did enjoy it.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>This set is controversial due to how the oceans were designed. From what I understand, many people were not so upset by the fact that it was a topographical map, but rather the colours chosen to portray it. While there is heavy contrast and the colours do stand out, I have to say I do like it.</p>

<p>A good thing about this set is that if you don&#39;t like the topographical ocean they provide as a base model, you can customize your oceans to make them special. Or, you could even customize the entire thing and use the white studs for another kind of map. I want to make a custom US map with these pieces eventually, and may even buy another copy for it! But for now, I like the given model and plan to keep it as is.</p>

<p>Another thing I want to mention is the size of the model. Pictures do not do it justice at all, is is gigantic. For a comparison to another large set, the World Map is about as long as the 75252 Imperial Star Destroyer. I have not yet hung it up, but it is going to take up a large space on the wall and will be a sight to behold, definitely catching anyone&#39;s eyes when walking into my room.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>I think this set is very deserving of the largest set ever. Many people disagree with that since it is an Art set, and that the tiles inflate the piece count. While this is true, it still outweighs any other Art set. Other Art sets are made of only 9 of the technic bases, while this one has 40! This is not just any Art set, this is the biggest and best Art set, and so I think this set is well deserving to be the largest.</p>

<p>While the build is repetitive, this set was still fun to assemble and is great for display. Even if you do not like the suggested model, this set is customizable to whatever you want. I recommend this set to anyone, provided you have the patience!</p>
