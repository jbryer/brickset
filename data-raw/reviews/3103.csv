"Rubberducky","2006-05-13T05:57:30Z","LOVE IT","i love this set because it it has 3 minifigs. i see that the redcoats are making a captured pirate row haha. i got this set from ebay along with &quot;harbour sentry&quot; so i made them battle eachother. i like how there are the little benches for the guys to sit on. loaded to the teeth and with a chest AND gold makes this set one of the best i have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-22T04:31:25.13Z","Good selection of parts","As a set, this is not very inspiring. On the other hand there is nothing useless in this one. Two redcoats, one pirate, a boat with flag, a treasure and last but not least some treasure-digging tools. So it still deserves a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-19T20:46:47.247Z","The new kids on the block...","The introduction of the redcoats as a new enemy for the pirates really took me by surprise at the time. The pirate theme was in need of some fresh ideas by 1992, there's no doubt about that. But this dramatic change (for me at least) merely provided a good opportunity to draw the line and kiss the theme goodbye...

For all those who decided to embrace this development, it dramatically broadened the scope of this theme. If one was able to muster enough French and English soldiers and officers, it would provide him with the means to stage battles from the Napoleontic era, like scenes from the battle at Waterloo. Some of the pirate torso's could very well be used for forming up a regiment of Hussar's if one had enough horses in his collection.

This possible scenario meant an investment of money and a degree of dedication that I wasn't prepared to commit to lego anymore at this point. This set was one of the last I've bought as a youth and marks the beginning of my personal dark-age as lego collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-15T16:47:58.28Z","Cool small set","This set of the pirates theme is like the others, small, with some pieces but these pieces are all useful, and with an classic lego pirates style. This set includes three minifigures, a pirate and two soldiers. All they have some differences but still in the original lego style. The design is simple but nice and the figures also have accessories like hats, bags and weapons, and also a flag of the soldiers and the original treasure of these themes. The boat included is so simple and also good. The playability is basic, but the set not have much pieces and fun. The pieces are really useful, and the building is easy and good. So, i rate the small pirates theme set &quot;Bounty Boat&quot; 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-09-17T16:47:07.373Z","Well-equiped treasure bountyhunter's boat","This set is a well equiped treasure bountyhunter's boat. It comes with a red officer, a regular red soldier and an evil grinning blue headed pirate that has to do the rowing, hahaha! Ofcourse you get a treasure with coins, but what I find more interesting is the equipment you get as well. A pickaxe, and a shovel.

Personally I prefer the blue-coated soldiers, but that's just my preference I guess. I once transformed this set to some blue guys therefor, with not much effort (just switched the flag and the officers).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-29T14:45:09.107Z","Bounty Boat Review","<p>This isn't too bad of a little set. Small, basically offering 3 minifigures and a little rowboat. As a result with the rowboat, there isn't much in the way of a build, so you're basically picking this set up for additional minifigures with 2 red coat Soldiers, pirate, treasure chest with gold and the rowboat. There's also a pick and a shovel suggesting these characters are either on their way to bury the treasure or have dug it up and are now bringing it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, it's decent, just simplistic and on a bad day, one can argue it wasn't very inspired on Lego's part.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-24T18:38:01.723Z","Double your Pirates, Double your Bounty","<p>Set #6247 Bounty Boat: Welcome to the seven seas with the Bounty Boat, a fun little set from the Pirates Theme that was ideal as a birthday or christmas gift for your LEGO collecting children, or just for being good when going to the store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photographic evidence prooves that I recieved this LEGO set as both a Birthday and Christmas present, which didn't bother me in the slightest. This little set is perfect for Pirate Troop Builders and Mini-Fig fans, it includes two Pirates, an Imperial Soldier and a Longboat, with two oars and a treasure chest. Truly an ideal set for Pirates enthusiasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the Mini-Figures you don't build much with this set, however overall it's still a great little addition to a Pirates Collection and a chance to troop build, something that LEGO Mini-Fig enthusiasts can get behind no matter what. Strongly Reccomended to Pirates and Mini-Fig fans.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4
"wipefeetnmat","2011-02-26T21:33:40.927Z","Bounty Boat 6247","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good army building set. An easy build it took me about ten minutes to find the instructions find the pieces and build the set. Here are the Pros and Cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pros:&nbsp;The chest&nbsp;has some golden coins in it not just yellow studs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Plenty of weapons and tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Three cool figures, one pirate and two soldiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cons: Needs a second pirate for a fair fight.</p>

"Hashem1983","2014-12-23T14:49:45.703Z","So little But So Many Things","<p>If you like pirates and you cannot get any of the Pirates Ship, this small sets has so many to give.</p>

<p>For starter in terms Instructions&nbsp;&amp; Building very easy.</p>

<p>In terms of Parts: The big thing about it is the treasure chest, for those who wants a treasure chest, this is a very excellent set just to get it, you also have nice decent amount of weapons, most important the Musket and the digging tools.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for Minifiguers: 3 minifiguers that comes with an Imperial Soldier, Imperial&nbsp;officer &amp; as it could be a slave pirate or just an Imperial seaman, your set your decision.<br />
Having the Imperial Soldier is great especially for his hat and the back&nbsp;bag, and as for the pirate or the seaman who has a bandana and an eye&nbsp;patch. Not that big thing about the officer but only his printed face.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Its more of an accessories set on a boat with a mission to go hide the treasure chest, still I love it.</p>
