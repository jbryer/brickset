<p>I got this set for free on two occasions at the Play Today LEGO Shop in Gouda, The Netherlands.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a decent enough selection of parts and building the set is fun too. The techniques used are smart, and the final model has no problem standing straight no matter how I pose it. Very stable!</p>

<p><em>But it is hideous.</em>&nbsp;The face has a menacing expression that just ruins most of the set, and the stubs for arms aren&#39;t helping much either. I would never buy this set myself and it really isn&#39;t&nbsp;worth the RRP of 5 bucks.</p>

<p>Mere moments after I finished building one, I immediately parted it out. Didn&#39;t even bother with the second one.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re <em>really </em>into clowns, there&#39;s no reason to get this set.</p>
