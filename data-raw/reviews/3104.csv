The volcano is nicely made, and the skull moves when you press the tooth.  The spring in the back causes it to erupt, shooting out red hot cinders and a skelly.  I wonder how the skelly got there to begin with though, but, that's off the beaten path.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set adds on nicely to make a huge pirate area for the Soldiers/Imperials to police.  The moving skull is a nice touch, and the raft is pretty crafty.  And you gotta love the skeleton!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My stepbro at the time got it tho and eventually gave it to me along with his other sets that were all busted and mixed together.  I loved looking and playing with his when I had it organized.  I used to combine it with my actual pirate set, Pirates Ambush and pretend that the alligator would chase the pirate on the raft into the cave and then later pop the skeleton out the top to imagine that the pirate and the skeleton were the same LOL!!  But with this set I love the details of the volcano and how easily this could combine with other pirate sets due to the colors and architecture similarity of other pirate islands.  One pirate and skeleton is pretty could amount of characters when you consider that is doesn't have very many pieces over 100.  Great set, Lego needs to design more sets like these in the future or at least re manufacture some of them from the past.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-03T16:54:23.843Z","Volcano Island","Another set of the pirates theme, the volcano island was released in 1996. This set includes two minifigures, a pirate and a skeleton. The both aren't new and have simple design, but are nice and still in a classic style. These have some other pieces like the hats. The building involved in this set is no much, but it still cool by the building fetures. The small boat of the pirate is simple, builted with some black blocks connected with barrels and with a large stick with a little flag of the pirates on the top. The other building of the set is the skull, a cove builted above some yellow blocks, that features the skull likeness and some gray coloured pieces to it looks like more a pile of rocks. All these pieces are useful and makes a good design. The skull is too nicely made with circular pieces as teeth. On the other side, there is a simple device builted with some pieces, to launch a minifigure when you press the teeth, and it works very well, altough is an old feature. Above the volcano, there are some fire pieces. Overall, an useful set with a awesome color scheme, design and good playability. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

","<p>Non-ship Pirates sets are a mixed bag, ranging from the flat-out impressive Imperial Trading Post (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6277-1"">6277</a>) to the abstract and somewhat lacking Shipwreck Island (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6296-1"">6296</a>). I think it’s safe to say that Volcano Island falls somewhere in between these two extremes, and I would then say that it leans more towards the awesome end than not. </p><p>Volcano Island is less of an island than it is a rock sticking out of the sea, but that fact does not detract at all from how cool this whole set up looks. Immediately apparent is the brilliant skull motif that hides the interior of the cavern, and the simple but effective turning mechanism gives a great feel of being able to “roll” the skull away to reveal the secret treasure within. Naturall, the BURP-sized space within is large enough to accommodate the included treasure chest, as well as a skeletal guardian for good measure. </p><p>At the top of the rocky precipice is what gives Volcano Island its name, a very sweet spring-loaded mechanism that can be pushed down, held, and released at an appropriate time to rain hot death down upon any wayward pirate that chances upon this secret location. It’s simple, but it’s very effective, dramatic, and fun to use. </p><p>Finally, you get yourself a pirate (of course) and a simple raft that is not much different at all from other rafts in other Pirates sets. I guess the raft is a needed addition since there’s not a whole lot of room on Volcano Island for anyone to really stand on, unless you don’t mind taking a bath in hot magma every so often.</p><p>Volcano Island is a great starter set, and I imagine that it’s also one that can serve as part of a larger design, should one decide to create a proper mountain beneath what comes with this set. If you are not so inclined (or perhaps lack the bricks and/or the creative drive to do so), Volcano Island serves beautifully on its own as part of any Pirates display. Sadly, I did not have enough Pirates sets of my own to display much of anything; all the same, I do remember having a lot of fun with this and I think you’ll do the same as well.</p>",TRUE,4,2,4,5,4

Man, how I wanted this set to be brilliant. It got everything going for itself: pirate, a raft, a&nbsp;volcano, skeleton figure, skeleton cave,...so how could Lego still mess this up? Well, let me tell you how:</p>

<p>Bad design choices!</p>

<p>Lets be honest here: this set is littered with bad design choices. The way the skeleton head is attached to the volcano is the most obvious one. Why oh why didn&#39;t they use a technic brick that fitted in with the shape of the head?&nbsp;When completing the model you are left with a skeleton head that has some weird lump growing out of the side of his jaw: it looks horrible. The raft is another miss: it is too small, looks clumsy&nbsp;and unrealistic (the barrels simply stop underneath the raft), has weird colors (the yellow?)&nbsp;and the use of the 2 &quot;boat-tile&quot; pieces beneath it, make&nbsp;it tilt all the time: so annoying.&nbsp;<br />
When constructing the volcano,&nbsp;2 red plates are mixed in &nbsp;with the build. Now, this would not be a problem if they weren&#39;t&nbsp;visible&nbsp;when lifting up the skeleton head, but they are! Why aren&#39;t they gray? Furthermore: the upper roof-tile pieces of the volcano are only attached at&nbsp;the bottom, making them &nbsp;fall off&nbsp;all of the time...sigh..so flimsy.<br />
Lastly, the shooting mechanism&nbsp;doesn&#39;t work properly. Most of the time, the skeleton minifigure gets stuck.&nbsp;Yes, the idea is/was great, and the&nbsp;spring&nbsp;is a wonderful piece, not seen too often (you can also find it in &quot;Blacktrons Spectral starguider&quot;), but the execution isn&#39;t done properly, shame.</p>

<p>Any redeeming factors? Well, not much to be honest. The blue baseplate is nice and always useful for pirate fans. The LURP&nbsp;and gray building bricks are&nbsp;good for making mountainterrain, and the pirate minfigure&nbsp;has a nice face and torso print. The peg-leg is an extra plus.</p>

<p>PROS:<br />
-the pirate<br />
-blue baseplate<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
-sadly too much to mention<br />
