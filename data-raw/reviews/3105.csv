"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-03T16:41:41Z","A Great Set!","      I should be starting to explain but first,I want to say that I couldn't be writing this without Shawn. He gave me this and Armada Sentry for a fee of $40. Thank you Shawn! Anyway, I really love this set! It's one of the coolest! I like the collapsing bridge the most. I put my Armada guy on the bridge and had the pirate release the bridge, having the guy fall onto the hungry and ornary croc! I'll bet that that soldier is in the LEGO hospital now!(if he escaped the croc and the quicksand I put for him there!)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T19:07:34Z","great. i've got alot to say.","This set is great. the collapsing net is unimaginable unless you have seen it work. it cannot be described using only words and the picture on the box and at the top of this page. it is very nice, and i rather like the Spanish Armada soldiers, thank you very much. the jail brig is awesome, using spears as bars. this technique is used also for the jail in Perilous Pitfall and Crocodile Cage. however, there are some bad parts:
first of all, i would like to remind everyone that the dropping net is NOT a bridge. pfft. who ever heard of pirates having a bridge made out of ROPE!!!? the contraption is simply to capture Spaniards or other people and throwing them into the jail (more on the jail deficiancies later). there is no bridge, and, therefore, the pirates have to SWIM across from one side of the gateway to the other (and that crocodile isn't just sitting there for nothing). also, the dropping mechanism tower is very lame. there are no floors. just a red brick with a cup on it and a small dock, then a structure with no floor. there is water right there, with no place for the pirates on the bottom floor to stand on, and, on the top floor, if a pirate steps backward, he will fall - into the water. basically, from a bird's-eye-view, you would see a structure sticking out at you with a cannon on top, a net, and a tower like the one with the cannon but not as tall and with no cielings or floors, so, from an ariel view, you can see water inside the structure. i put a floor on the bottom and on the top so that my pirates would have something to stand on. the tower with the cannon is disapointing. the bottom floor is a jail, the second floor is just a floor, with no table, just a litttle wooden fencish thing keeping the people from falling fowrard. there is none to keep them from falling back, and, if the net is down, they could fall to one side, as well. the cannon on top is unfortified. it shouldn't be so high up on such a flimsy tower. it just doesn't make sence. also, i know that the plants are supossed to be hydrophyllic plants, (plants that grow in water), they are too out of place. the set should come with a different kind of plant, like that mossy stuff.
from my review, it may seem that i hate this set. quite the contrary. with about 3 ajustments, this set can be absolutely fantastic. the net is great, and i like the rowboat alot. when i play with this set, the Spaniard is just an explorer heading out from the Armada Flagship scouting for a place to build an Armada Sentry post. when he sees the Pirates Ambush structure, he begins to turn around, and the cannon starts shooting at him. he makes it back to the flagship just in time, and the ship sets out to conquer the pirates. however, it just so happens that the Caribbean Clipper just happens to sail along at that moment, and the pirates on Pirate Ambush send out a small boat to get help from the Black Seas Barracuda. the three boats all meet about 300 yards away from the Pirates Ambush, and a long story is born...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"salahadin","2010-10-17T12:52:38.82Z","This is one of the rare sets, which be worth have.","Very long time I missed this set. Until now, when I got it. I like the idea of ambush. Moreover there is rare imperial soldier (""spanish soldier"") and infrequent pirates. Assault is well-considered, lot of fun you enjoy with falling sow. I like also american cannon with emblem of crossed cannons, but cannon cannt fire. I appreciate&nbsp; an unplastics flag.<br>However, there are only 2 pirates, I think 3 pirates could be optimal. <br><br>Summary: 6249 is very good set, you enjoy it. From 1997 is one of the best! <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
