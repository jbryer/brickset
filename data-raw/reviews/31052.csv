<p>My youngest son started playing Minecraft since about 2014 and while I don&#39;t play, I think it&#39;s really valuable for young kids. I got this polybag set because of the minifigures -- I like the 8-bit printing and block shaped heads, and I love all Lego skeletons so this was an easy decision. Both minifigs also come with a Minecraft accessory, a sword and bow and arrow.</p>

<p>This is the same Steve minifig as many other Minecraft sets but the <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/min090/wither-skeleton-bent-arms"">Wither Skeleton</a> is unique to this set (at this time, anyway.)&nbsp; I love that it&#39;s a black skeleton.</p>

<p>The rest of this set is basic bricks and just went straight into my sorting drawers.&nbsp; There are some good colors here so it&#39;s not a waste.&nbsp; The build (were you to build it) is very basic.</p>

<p>This polybag is a great deal at $5 for two minifigs and some extra Lego pieces thrown in. On that basis alone, I would recommend it.&nbsp; I bought two for myself.</p>
