What makes it special is its rear wheel construction, which parts were borrowed from the technics sets. It was very easy to build even as kid and started my collection of construction vehicles. I always had a road construction under way in my town, and this one was always part of it.</p>

"peti7788","2021-12-13T09:04:56.637Z","No health and safety regulation","<p>My second favorite after firefighting sets is the construction theme.&nbsp;In principle, this is the first construction/maintenance set that is compatible with the minifigure.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>Classic smiling face with classic shovel and helmet.&nbsp;There is no printed torso or visibility vest like the other 1978 sets.</p>

<h3>Digger</h3>

<p>Similar to the diggers&nbsp;released in the late <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6524-1/Blizzard-Blazer"" target=""_blank"">1980s</a> and early <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1876-1/Soil-Scooper"" target=""_blank"">1990s</a>, only the roof and details are missing.&nbsp;They could have put at least one roof on it. It could even have been solved with an old type 1x2x4&nbsp;window piece and two 1x4 plate, or one 1x4 arch brick.</p>

<p>The 1x1 rounded old gray brick still has a solid stud.</p>

<p>Incidentally, a year later, the same set was released in North America with two minifigures, called <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/542-1/Street-Crew"" target=""_blank"">542 Street Crew</a>.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t stick to the original box and instructions, you can buy it cheaply, it doesn&rsquo;t contain rare parts.&nbsp;An extra dump truck is still recommended.</p>

<h3>My Mod</h3>

<p>I missed the fact that there was no roof, so it was not very safe to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I took the yellow arch from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/374-1/Fire-Station"" target=""_blank"">374 set</a>. And I borrowed the yellow light from the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/670-1/Mobile-Crane"" target=""_blank""> 670 set</a>.</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T17:02:29.837Z","A fun, slightly complex, little build","<p>For a small set, this proved to be a more complex build than anticipated, but as with all these occurrences in Lego, it&#39;s another lesson in how to build. The arrangement of the wheels turned out to be an introduction to pieces I&#39;d later use in the Technic range at school in technical design classes. But for me, the extra building around to make the driver&#39;s cab was a nice design touch, and it would have been good to see this used on more sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having seen construction worker sets like this one in Lego catalogues at the time, I was looking forward to a minifigure with a hi-viz tabard, but was disappointed when this turned out to be a sticker. The previous arrangement, with a &#39;vest&#39; that slipped over the minifigure&#39;s torso, would have been more durable. But this aside, it&#39;s a fun little set.</p>
