However, it should have come with Admiral Broadside, 'cause he's rare and also the officers are gonna get clobbered, even if they are sneaking up on the pirates :).  All in all, though, good set for acsessories and 2/3 rare figures.    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-07T05:11:57.567Z","OK","Nothing special (well, maybe the female pirate), but it's always nice to expand your minifig collection. I would have liked one more soldier though, because my pirates are starting to outnumber my soldiers by quite a margin. But then again, this is &quot;lego pirates&quot; and not &quot;lego soldiers&quot;, right?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-09T17:17:40.28Z","Pirates Minifigures","This set is small, just like some other pirates sets from their first years, but this features some minifigures. The mini figures uses a good design on each, and also the pirates classic style. The minifigures included are two male pirates (one pirate and one captain), one female pirate minifigure and two soldiers. The hats, weapons and the wood leg of the captain are in a cool model to use on all the mini figures. This set also includes a bird and a treasure, that be very well in other pirates themes and like all the pieces on the set are very useful. There are no much pieces, because this set is basically made to feature only minifigures. The playability is also just like all the other, and the set still in classic style. So, i rate the Pirate Mini Figures 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-17T03:35:31.607Z","Minifig joy!","I think this was the first Pirate set I got,and boy did I love it. It comes with a pretty good spread of figures,and I think I ended up getting a few of these because I have a lot more Officers and Soldiers than I should(thank goodness)
Anyway,its worth it just for the fact you get a soldier and an officer-a good way to build up your French army,they are pretty scarce in most sets.
You can never have enough gold,and another wench or two never goes astray me harty Ive got to give it a 5/5,because those Blue guys are like Hen's teeth to me!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-28T15:13:24.487Z","Pirates Minifigures Review","<p>This collection of Pirate minfigures came out in the first year or so of the theme's introduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigure collections like this have always been good for the number of new figures provided to extend out play or armies in other larger sets. As such, there usually isn't any build involved other then putting minifigures together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have 3 Pirates, Captain Redbeard himself, a rare or uncommon female pirate and red shirt pirate swabbie or mate. Two Imperial soldiers, parrot&nbsp;and a chest with gold coins.</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-24T17:33:31.557Z","Mini-Figure Battle Packs before Licensed Themes","<p>Set #6251 Pirate Mini-Figures: Back in the early days of the LEGO Pirates System this Mini-Figure collection was a must have item for children and parents on a budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pirate Mini-Figures in this collection included the rare, hard to find at a cheap price Female Pirate, Captain Redbeard, a Male Pirate and two Imperial Soldiers, as well as a parrot, a chest full of gold and weapons galore. Perfect for starting a little bit of playtime for the kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that this set was definitely a great value, as the Female Pirate Mini-Fig was a rarity and this was the cheapest set to feature her. A great value for your dollar, it's a bit of a shame that most Mini-Figure collections these days cost more and can only be found through LEGO S&amp;H for the Themes that aren't Licensed.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5
"MatthewLM","2014-04-08T15:36:10.227Z","Not a bad mini-figure set.","<p>In 1989, the Lego Pirates were introduced and kids rejoiced. However for the several whose parents could not afford a Black Seas Barracuda, they had to make do with some of the cheaper ones or if you&#39;re just starting off, this is a good beginning.</p>

<p>You get three pirates. The mighty Captain Red Beard, the wench, which you couldn&#39;t find elsewhere in cheaper sets, and the scruffy red shirt mustachioed pirate. You also get an Imperial commander and a soldier. Also a parrot and gold. Can&#39;t have a pirate set without the two. You have some playability. You could have the two parties fight over gold or just fight in general, among other scenarios. If I can think of a couple of down points, there should be more guns so the figures would have a bit of versatility to battle each other. And another soldier wouldn&#39;t hurt to balance it all out (not to mention build the French army).</p>

<p>Could&#39;ve been a little bit more, but not a bad set in its own right.</p>
