"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-22T10:44:26Z","nice set, but isn't really great.","this set isn't really that good. it is like an accessory pack. it comes with Captain Redbeard, a scurvy dog, a British captain and a British soldier. it also has a treasure chest with 8 pieces of eight, and a monkey holding a pirate flag. 
redbeard is too common!!!!!!!! this set needs to have him, but the scurvy dog should have been the rare brown vested man like in Imperial Outpost. the British Captains are WAY too common. this set should have had Admiral Woodhouse, because Redbeard could run the captain through any day. Woodhouse could take him, but not a captain. other than that, it's okay. it has plenty of weapons. extra treasure is always welcome. it just needs a better figure selection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-25T15:43:52.31Z","The Sea Mates","This is a small set of the pirates theme that was released in the year of 1993. Like a minifigure pack, this include two minifigures of pirates, two soldiers and a monkey. This is small, so, have not much pieces, but the few pieces are useful. The two soldiers minifigures are not new but they have a good design and color scheme. The both have some itens like the hats, a sword or shotgun. The minifigures of the pirates not features new things, but altough these are simple, some things like the simple design and the hat, the sword and the wood leg makes a cool effect. The minifigure of the monkey is like all lego monkeys, a so playable minifigure with hands as paws, that makes another cool thing in this little set. The simple designed bird have a nicecolor scheme but is not playable, because is a solid unic piece. The flag included is like some flags of this theme and stay very cool if builted in a ship. The treasure chest is great, but also features no much, because some sets like this, released early, had some of the same pieces.
Altough this set with useful pieces can increase other sets of the pirates theme, this have no much differences from other pirates minifigures packs. So, i rate the Sea Mates 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-28T15:19:17.94Z","Sea Mates Review","<p>Sea Mates is the second Pirates minifigure collection done for the Pirates theme in 1993. Again, a set like this is about the minifigures and not any specific build. About the only figure repeated and now redundant is that of Captain Redbeard. There's a different Pirate mate with him, and two red Imperial soldiers along with&nbsp;a monkey, parrot,&nbsp;pirate flag&nbsp;and a chest of gold coins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's enough of a mix up in the minifigures from the first set done that it's still very worthwhile to pick this set up and use it to expand armies and extend out play with varioius sets and builds.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-24T18:27:17.55Z","It's Pirate Time","<p>Set #6252 Sea Mates: I had this set for a long time before parting with it along with the rest of my Pirates Mini-Figs, my cousin more than likely still has them, unless she gave them to her younger brother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right off the bat I lost one of the gold pieces from this set when I first opened it after buying them, I was at my mother's place of employ and killing time until we could go home, it was unfortunate, but I had tons of Pirate gold from all my other sets so it wasn't that bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set includes five Mini-Figures, yes five, despite only having Captain Redbeard, a pirate and two Imperial Soldiers in red it also includes the Monkey piece, one of the cheapest sets from back in the day to include that piece. LEGO definitely&nbsp;knew how to incite sales of their products back then, this set was always selling out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this was a must own set back then and still a worthy set to pick up, as it offers the chance to build up your Imperial Soldier army and you can't go wrong if you're a fan of the Mini-Figures, but don't want to pay crazy e-bay prices for the large Pirates sets to get a Monkey or Captain Redbeard.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
