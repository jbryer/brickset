This set have too the normal version, but is basically the same thing. Have nothing wrong if compared with small sets. The contents aren't useless, but very useful, is easy see that. Useful to more than bionicle, but also for technic or too racers, altough are few. The shield of the tahnok as the face of the set was placed here to looks like something with the bohrok to have something to like in the storyline. This, the storyline, tells that the bohrok-va carries dormant krana (masks compatible with toa mata/nuva faces or for the matorans from 2004, different than kanohi, don't made with the same material), placed on one piece of the body of this (if it falls, is easy replaces the piece with a bohrok) to equip the bohrok with that if the bohrok losted it's krana.

Understanding that, is easy compare this set to other small, and see the useful contents, cool colors (these that are too very cool and makes some parts useful) and the playability, altough don't the best, is good for a small set that carries a mask on the back. The color scheme, like of the tahnok, have the cool orange and red (same of tahu), and too blue in the eyes and black pieces, as hands or the body. Another useful parts are the feet, same of the first matoran(also named Tohunga, previously), and the staff from vakama (turaga version of vakama). Is easy say that this set isn't correct, is terrible or don't have playability if compared with many lego sets and don't with the ideas or objectives of the set. Of course, don't buy it if this costs more than a matoran of Karda Nui or more (maybe the set turn more expensive due to be an older one), but if in the normal cost of it, this is recommended if you searchs for complete the collection of bohrok va or if you search for a little old bionicle set, also if you wish complement your bohrok swarm. This so, if compared with it's objectives, have a 4,6 of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
