If you move the platform, you find a treasure chest, but when you move the platform it moves the cave, revealing treasure and the skeleton. Great set with good playability.

There are about a bizillion pieces of gold and has a uniquly sized baseplate. When you move the platform, it opens the cave revealing the skeleton. Also comes with red rowboat. The only other thing i could have asked for this set is one more musket-thingy. It is still a great set, it just could have used a weapon of two more.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-11T17:16:39Z","no one has reviewed this set well.","qdog, BOB BOB BOB and anonymous's review are half rubbish.
Anonymous, these two pirates are out looking for treasure, not attacking a soldier outpost. they don't need another musket or blunderbuss.

BOB BOB BOB, there aren't 40 pieces of gold in this set. there are 4. you were off by 36 pieces.

q dog, this set's baseplate isn't unique. Pirates Ambush has the exact same baseplate, something you would know if you had bought Pirates Ambush...

however, folks, these people did get one thing right: this set rocks. when you move the big yellow platform, it releases Brigand (that is the skeleton's name) from his rocky prison. he comes out and attacks the pirates (what ever comes next, you have to decide: they might just go out and grab a Subway, or they could have a massive battle bringing about the end of the earth...). however, two problems made me give this set a 9.

other than the fact that the palm tree is growing on a small lump of sand sticking out of the water, it is kinda bad (but predictable) that after opening the secret door, closing it doesn't close the rock chamber. this isn't as annoying as the fact that you can't place a pirate anywhere on this set that looks like he's looking for the treasure without disabling the trap door. the pirate has to be standing on the platform, so, when it moves, the pirate would move with it, and he would run away without even looking at what's behind him. unless he is standing on the boat and leaning over a tremendous amount, he won't look like he's digging and still free the skeleton.
all in all, this is a great set, but it needs more treasure.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2010-07-13T00:39:07.46Z","A great little set.","<p>This is most certainly one of the better pirate sets this size.&nbsp; It's well-designed and&nbsp;has plenty of useful pieces.&nbsp; The skeleton in the rocks and the hidden treasure are interestig features and will I'm sure provide plenty of opportunity for playability.</p>

"MPH","2007-08-17T11:28:39.02Z","Yuck!","Don't get me wrong. Most lego pirates islands are hideouts of some sort, so I love the idea of an island that is 'just' an island where the pirates can dig for treasure. But this set is so ugly! Especially when you hide the treasure and the skeleton. I would say even the cheap-o Buried Treasure is aesthetically more appealing... 

But hey, it's not all bad. We get those great pirate minifigs (I know, just the standard ones, but I like them best!) and a skeleton. Very welcome for my ever-growing army of the undead. A palm tree is always nice and so are the treasure, parrot and rowboat. Nothing you can't get from other sets though. Playability is good, with all the moving parts. 

So: good parts, good playability, but the ugly design brings it down to three stars for me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2018-05-10T18:37:52.42Z","Old school Gold-diggers !!","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks :</strong> Funny little Pirate-set coming from the 90&#39;s. I had it for some time already but never built it. Definitely a cute little set with the usual hiding places and very complete. Not too much special parts, just a nice set to own and/or to play with. For collectors still not hard to find for a reasonable price.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks :</strong> Not a difficult set to built with very good and clear instructions. After some fifteen minutes you&#39;re the owner of a tropical island with a treasure guarded by a skeleton. Nice working construction that opens the cave when you turn away the plate that hides the treasure chest. The only strange thing is the palm tree growing beside the island in the sea. Some more yellow bricks to expand the island and connect would have been more logical.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks :</strong> No real special parts but it&#39;s very complete with 3 figures, a boat, a tree and a treasure.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks :</strong> It&#39;s really an all included little set with 2 secret spaces, the 3 mini figures with weapons and a boat. No enemy&#39;s needed here because it are treasure hunters.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks : </strong>You can find it <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=6254-1#T=P"">used for some &euro; 25,00</a> which is not bad for 25 year old set which was in those years some &euro; 15,00 which is about the same I paid in 2011. Definitely worth it.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2019-07-14T13:02:47.353Z","Good things come to those who wait","<p>When Lego released their Pirate theme in 1989, it became an instant success, and rightly so. The sets where simply amazing: great ships, great minifigures, nice fortresses and hide-outs, nicely printed base-plates. We could not have asked for more.</p>

<p>However, I always felt that there was something missing. In the Lego Pirate comic book &quot;the golden medallion&quot;, released in the same year (1989), we find our pirates in search for treasure on a distant island. Sadly enough, Lego didn&#39;t release any pirate sets that related to the story from the comic book.&nbsp;Sure, we had set 6235 &quot;buried treasure&quot;, but that set left much to be desired for, and only hinted at pirates&nbsp;sailing off in search for gold, gems and richness...</p>

<p>6 years after the first wave, I finally got what I had been waiting for all this time. My expectations where high, and were met. Truly, good things come to those who wait.</p>

<p>This set ticks all the boxes:<br />
-pirates? Check!<br />
-deserted island? Check!<br />
-treasure? Check!<br />
-pirates on a deserted island looking for treasure? Check!</p>

<p>This set delivers and it does so in a good way. The island isn&#39;t that big, but big enough. The rock-formation and palmtree give&nbsp;it that little bit of extra texture and volume. The colors make sense, apart form the white plate under the sliding rock,&nbsp;the 2 red jumpers that hold&nbsp;the skeleton, and the blue seats in the boat, &nbsp;but they are easily replaced.<br />
The mechanism to reveal the treasure and skeleton works smoothly over and over again. The sliding rock formation is a nice extra, lifting the set up to a higher degree,&nbsp;creating&nbsp;an extra dimension to the basic story of the treasure-digging pirates.</p>

<p>I also especially love how Lego got little details right:<br />
Palmtrees actually are able to grow on small isolated pieces of land, the pirates get a necessary treasuremap and a pickaxe (not a shovel, because it is a rocky reef!), and the gray bricks mixed inbetween the yellow bricks, make it clear that this is actually a rocky reef and not just an island of sand.</p>

<p>Then why only 4 stars and not 5? Well, this set is good, but not perfect. I would have loved seeing this set build on the same baseplate as used in the &quot;forbidden island&quot; set. A slightly bigger island, with some extra detailing or some traps would have made this set perfect. Also, the yellow cylinder&nbsp;always puzzled me: why is it there, what is it for,...But hey, beggars can&#39;t be choosers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS:<br />
-smooth action feature<br />
-attention for details<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
-Some weird colorchoises<br />
