"jahwarrior624","2007-08-20T11:15:12.85Z","Fun Comic","A clever comic with a fun theme.  Helps you develop a personality for the characters if your imagination needs a jump start.  Plus a great way to learn the names of the lego figures if you had no idea before.

Worth the read.  The game on the last page is actually kinda fun.  It's simple but an amusing way to pass some time if you need to.

There is even a very neat Lego Pirate scene on the back cover of the book.

"SimonStickfish","2008-08-31T18:07:15.187Z","A classic comic","It was also in Dutch, I still have it. But somehow, I got it without the two minifigures. But the beardless red-headed pirate (&quot;Wil&quot;) can also be found in set #6267 and the other brown-capped pirate can also be found in a lot of other sets. I still love it, and every now and then I read it again. It also contains the castle of Eldorado and a couple of large ships that are in various other models. I once tried to build the pirate's town that was in the story, and I never got it right :-(.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2013-04-02T06:27:21.02Z","Pirates Of The Caribbean","<p>Essentially this is just a comic with some extra minifigures included but god I loved it.&nbsp;Its hidden somewhere in the attic and I almost forgot it until sitting in the cinema watching the first Pirates Of The Caribbean film reminded me of it- it has strange similarities!&nbsp;The plot is not the same, there is just a thing going on between pirate &#39;Will&#39; and a posh girl from the naval crowd who passes out and is rescued.&nbsp;The atmosphere of pirate stories were exciting enough on their own merits without the supernatural.</p>

<div><b>Minifigures:</b></div>

<ul>
	<li>&#39;Will&#39; A young pirate cabin boy.</li>
	<li>&#39;Rummy&#39; Captain Redbeard&#39;s second in command.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Will is&nbsp;in red and white striped vest, red bandana and trousers. The vest print also gets a decent belt print. His friend Rummy&nbsp;was a personal favourite Pirates MF in grey britches, &#39;gold&#39; lined blue jacket, red and white striped vest and three cornered brown hat. The stubble and eye patch head was an excellent introduction for head variation.&nbsp;These are just the comic character names, enough MFs were in the Pirate boxed sets to allow individual character design and mix ups. These two get a couple of swords, a blunderbuss or two and the fabulous pirate map printed tile.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Ripping Yarn</b><br />
The extras are welcome as additions to other sets but I was sure they were already available and some variant characters may have been more appreciable. The play with them alone is limited but with a few basic bricks there is a game worth playing at the back of the comic.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The higher award goes for the fact this release is mainly a comic and as such its a good children&#39;s comic. The illustrative cartoon strips are nicely done, the adventurous story is fun and well thought out and includes some historically dangerous references; knockout hits on the head, thre threat of being shot, the threat of swords, death by accident and the threat of hanging, so no fluffing up history so as not to scare kids. The two part gold coin, map and treasure adventure is absolute classic pirate tale stuff and full of humour and clever ideas. Fleshing out the Naval side of things was good too and the backgrounds create some lovely building ideas for Pirate layouts which are short on &#39;normal&#39; buildings and sea ports and harbours. I remember a custom kids-built Caribbean or English layout was more evocative than any other theme, always using plenty of white and yellow bricks for buildings.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Gold Coin</b><br />
It was not that cheap for a comic but as a one off was worth the purchase. There are also a small series of Ladybird books available, I saw them once but they were not as high quality as the comic. The play and building aspect was always going to be more fulfilling but if you liked every part of the early theme, it may be worth seeking out this old comic as a handy bit of paraphernalia and there is no reason why pirate fan children should not enjoy this again.</div>

"AETerry","2011-01-12T01:04:58.877Z","Lego Pirates Comic","<p>I remember me and my cousin discovering this Lego Comic at the Toy Store when we were kids and as we each had our allowances on us, we each snagged and picked up a copy of the comic for ourselves. So the thrill as kids being able to use our own money instead of begging parents and something we wanted that wasn't spent on candy was well worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have that comic too after all these years. As a comic geared towards kids, it had some good art work and holds a fun little story making use of settings and characters from the Pirate Theme. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The comic came with two minifigures, the red capped pirate youth Will and the pirate first mate wearing the brown tricorne hat Rummy. So now aside from Redbeard himself, you have two other named minifigures for the Pirate theme. The Leader for the Imperial Army in the Eldorado Fort is also named, Broadside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game presented at the back of the comic was worth building at least once and playing out a couple times between me and my cousin. It was fairly standard roll dice, move forward, get to the end. But it gave the comic a bit more depth and something of an activity after words as we&nbsp; tried to build the game board from our own lego pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It'd be fun and great if some more comics and books in this style where a minifigure or two are included came out. And the few that I do see in the Brickset archieves look good, such as two for Atlantis are either unpublished or those who've bought them, aren't reselling. So probably better marketing to announce the comics/books are there.</p>",TRUE,5,2,3,4,5
