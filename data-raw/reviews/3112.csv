"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T15:03:01Z","Great Set","This was the first lego set I ever got. It has two minifigs and several great pieces, including two, count 'em, TWO red canoes... Awesome. This also includes a cool striped drum piece and a beautiful sail. With the addition of a couple of parrots and a shield, along with a rotating mast, and with awesome detailed bodies, both with printed legs, this set it the greatest!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-30T01:34:12.107Z","Great set.","This is a nice little set.  The raft mounted on two canoes is an original idea, and the model comes with many useful pieces.  Included are two islander minifigs, an alligator, a cloth flag and two parrots.

"MPH","2007-09-12T05:49:37.373Z","Sooo nice!","This set is just... WOW! Everything - well nearly everything - is perfect about it. The catamaran concept is unique in the lego pirate series and is so beautifully executed. The colors are great, the sail fits in nicely, and it's overall perfectly balanced. Getting a cool drum and a croc as a bonus is just icing on the cake.

My only complaint would be the fact that also this set has King Kahuka. Why not just two regular islanders? Kahuka is in way too many sets... Nevertheless this set deserves the full 5/5. Excellent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:39:31.7Z","Kahuka's travelers ship","In my imagination, this is the main transport of Kahuka/the king. The design is lovely and brilliant. The mast rotates I believe. Nice is the rare female figurine, I have always seen her as the maid/wife of Kahuka. I believe I once made a modification to this set, by increasing the capacity. You can also disassemble the set for extra canoes.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-16T20:19:42.937Z","Best Canoe Ever Made!","Lego has made some sets with the canoe piece in it. However, this one has the best use of a canoe piece. The sail is very cool and now is rare. The islander minifigs are pretty cool too. 5 out of 5 for a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bricktoothyo","2008-11-22T22:09:43.78Z","excellent addition!","This set is really fun-alongside Kahuka and the Islander Princess you get the catamaran itself which you can turn into two canoes,2 parrots and a crocodile!
Im a sucker for sets with lots of animals in them,so I love this one!
Put four Islander warriors on this set and it looks FANTASTIC.
I use them as an added danger for the pirates/soldiers as they attempt to loot gold from the Islands.
My only gripe is that as others have mentioned,king kahuka appears too many times in the islander sets-the warrior headpieces are hard to find!
But overall,I couldnt help but give this a 5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-28T11:24:16.98Z","LEGO Pirates (Islanders) - Islander Catamaran Review","This set is my first and only set which I got from the LEGO Pirates (Islanders) theme. It's a fun and easy build and the catamaran is very sturdy. You get a few stickers which you have to put on. What I like about this set are the rare pieces like the plate for the drum, the shield on the front and the big sail. The whole design is cool and you also get two parrots and a crocodile. The minifigs are very cool. I like the big mask of the islanders king which is also a rare piece. The hair piece of the female islander is also a rare piece to this theme but I noticed that LEGO remade this element in the new LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Cannibal Escape</span> set which is cool. I think it's a good set for little money.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>This was the first Islanders set that I purchased back in 1994. I was instantly drawn to the colourfulness and design which captured my imagination. Lego had colourful sets before, the luminous greens and oranges of M-Tron and Ice Planet for example, but nothing at the time matched the exuberant Islanders for colour and unique ideas.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This catamaran is perhaps one of the finest watercraft Lego ever designed. The basis is two standard red canoes, with the addition for four stickers for the Islander tribal decoration. On top of these, a series of full and half-arch bricks are used to join the two canoes together and to form the basis of the main platforms where the crew stand. A simple hinge for the paddle used as&nbsp;a rudder is&nbsp;formed from using a 1x2 side handle brick and a clip brick. Additional clip bricks are used for stowing&nbsp;spears and ornamental art (more on that later). The mast is mounted on a turntable and is carries the unique printed Islander sail which only appeared in three sets. The turntable is flanked by two 1x2 hook bricks however (one of which mounts the drum and the other is left spare)&nbsp;which prevents the mast being turned around. The finishing touches are amazing; two parrot bricks as matching figureheads, cow horns, a shield with printed Islanders motif and the drum with its zebra striped 2x2 circular flat brick, which was another bespoke brick for the Islanders range.</p>

<p>The construction is involved and interesting but actually quite simple and is an easy build. It is also very sturdy and will take rough handling pretty well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This catamaran comes with two Islander minifgures. The first is King Kahuka himself complete with head mask and the set comes with a staff that you can assemble with a cow horn and a blue brick as a jewel. The body is printed with palm leaves on the legs and a tooth necklace on the torso. The head has&nbsp;red and white face paint. The second is a female Islander (Mrs Kahuka?) which was unique to this set. The legs and torso are decorated with leaves,&nbsp;the&nbsp;head features red lipstick lips (a common female head of this time) and a standard Islander hair brick which includes&nbsp;horns.</p>

<p>The King and his wife come armed with no less than three spears. And just as well as also included in this set is a Lego crocodile with opening mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion this set is a classic; peak 90s Lego with lots of imagination and bright colours and cool designs. I didn&#39;t do much to this set, it seemed perfect as it was and had many a battle against the marauding pirates. The Pirate range had some excellent rafts and watercraft over the years alongside the bigger sailing ships, but this set is probably one of the best they designed.</p>

"markwashington","2016-12-29T23:18:47.087Z","Look at that sail!","<p>Islander Catamaran (Indigo chief&#39;s canoe in the UK) is a medium sized Islander set released in 1994. The UK catalogue had this to say about the set &quot;Is easily able to out manoeuvre the pirates and soldiers BUT will it escape the crocodile?</p>

<p>The first thing I will say when reviewing this set is that I absolutely love the sail. I love cloth sails in Lego sets and this is one of the best. It makes the set a must own and the frankly bonkers colours are perfect!</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve got the sail out of the way what else (does it really need anything else?) does the set have to offer? First of all it&#39;s a fairly simple build, no difficult techniques and the instructions are very easy to follow. The minifigures are very nice, as are all the islanders, and this set is one of only two to contain the female islander (the other being 6278). She has the same face as the female pirate and the same hair as her male counterparts (presumably they only had one barber who could only do one type of hair cut) but a different torso print which as a child I thought was fairly racy. The King is the second figure and he has his usual mask and staff. The bulk of the catamaran is two canoes with a small platform connecting them together.</p>

<p>This is a really pleasing set to look at once its built and will grace any Islander display, the sail is amazing and the female fig is a real bonus. It&#39;s still reasonably cheap so I&#39;d say get it and even if you don&#39;t like the set you can always frame the sail!</p>
