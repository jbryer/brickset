I got some rocks from the beach and on my table was the table sea and the rocks small islands who were discovered by the pirates. The barrels are great the pirates and the map too. The raft is nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-04T22:00:08Z","Best of the Worst by FAR","this set is awesome. for it's size. the raft is quaint, cute, cool, and the finest one in the entire Pirate System. the &quot;raft&quot; in Raft Raiders is so unrealistic. no rafts have sails like that or rigging, masts, none of that. the one in Rock Island Refuge doesn't look any better than this one, and i like the mini flagsails of this raft. they are cool. 
the figures make this set amazing. while not  the most uncommon figures there are out there, there are a lot compared to the rest of the set. i'm gonna throw a little bit of math at you right now: 3 figures for 50 pieces = 1 figure  per every 17 pieces (rounded up). that means that, with the same ratio, you would get something like 50 pirates in the Skull's Eye Schooner (i don't have that, but i read the amount of pieces on brick link, and it amounts to something like 850). 50 pirates on a boat! that means that about, using a figure ratio of men to women figures on that boat, you would get 7 women pirates! but, lego didn't use those complicated math ratios, so the SES, BSB and RBR only come with 7 figures between them all. 
basically, compared to it's size, Castaway's Raft is crawling with pirates. there is only one problem. the flags are on lances. which means that they have to be unnaturaley spread out, which makes them look a little bad. but that's not that big of a problem. it's still a great set with 3 figures, 5 weapons (one blunderbuss, two muskets and two cutlasses), 5 mini flags (one Jolly Roger emblem, 4 white), four barrels (all used as part of raft) two lances and loads of possiblilties
ps sorry for the complicated math procedures, they just prove my point. try to make sence of them and you will realize the supremacy of this tiny set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-22T04:12:56.6Z","Wonderful raft!","There is so much to love in this set! Of course the raft itself, which has a great made-out-of-debris look. Unlike the later raft 6261 that looks way too sophisticated. As if pirates would go out on a raft just for fun?! 

Oh well, back to this one. The minifigs. Three is a huge amount considering the size of the set. There's nothing special about them though, but I don't mind. I don't need anchor tattoos or whatever on my pirate torsos. I like the striped shirts best!

This set also has some nice extras. A shark for instance, waiting for one of the pirates to slip overboard. Second there is a map - I don't think there are many small sets having one - and finally one of those awesome pirate flags.

"davidschor","2007-08-04T19:34:25.74Z","Perfect Small Pirate Set","Of the small pirate sets, this is clearly the finest.  I own a number of pirate sets, but this one is by far the finest in its size.  It includes three figures, a great raft, a shark (!), a treasure map, and three figures.  There is nothing to complain about here.  Endless fun in a very compact package.  The shark alone was worth the retail price of this set.  A fantastic complement to the pirate ship, too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SimonStickfish","2008-09-17T16:38:19.67Z","Little rolling stock!","This set is just amazing, because it kind of rolls! That's why this is my pirate's rolling stock. It comes with two regular pirates, a steering man who managed to save the treasure map and a shark. The shark is probably to keep the men on the nice raft from starving to death. The sails are what was left of the bigger ship they came from. I believe I have this set twice, but that makes two cute little indeed made up of &quot;scrap&quot; rolling barges, and lots of rum containers. You get some firearms and a jolly roger-flag as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Personally, I think black is the wrong color. It should be a brownish color. 
Sail is missing, too.

"lukaszwaw","2010-07-01T17:20:50.043Z","Really OK set!","I played this set when I was 12 with my neighbour. It was an early 90,s, 1991 i think. Really hard to find and expensive in Poland. 3 figs and some guns relally enjoyed us. We could only dream about Forbidden Island or Blue Lagoon...Now i have&nbsp;them all:). However i,m 31 now the memory of earliest sets is still true and alive so i collect them right now. I have Castaway.s Raft new, just once pieces together(really hard to find but i made it:). So it,s standing like finest flower on my desk and remainds me about old good times.",FALSE,5,3,3,5,5
"AETerry","2011-01-29T15:21:17.003Z","Castaway's Raft Review","<p>This I believe is the first raft of it's kind done by Lego for their Pirates theme. As the first, it's not the best looking in the long run. It's better by far compared to Kraken Attackin' set from 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main problem with the raft comes from what serves as a mast and flimsy sails. The post falls over way too easilly for my tastes with design. The rest though is great, lego barrels for the bottom and floatation. A shark that trails after waiting for a meal. You get three minifigures - all pirates. One with a tricorne hat, a blue shirt swabbie and a red shirt swabbie. Between them, there's&nbsp;a good little assortment of weapons and treasure map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It stands out for being a classic and among the first Pirate themed sets to appear.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Chrinchy","2020-07-27T15:45:06.147Z","A Good Idea!","<p><strong>Building Experience:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The building experience was really fun and simple which I like in a set like this. It&nbsp;had some really useful and fun pieces to make the raft stand out which are explained more in the Parts section. The instructions were clear to follow and it can be assembled in minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>This set contains some really fun parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> 3 pirates, 2 sailors and 1 midshipman, is what I&#39;m going to call him. I like how they didn&#39;t include a Captain in this one just for variety and perhaps realism. These castaways could have had a mutiny gone bad and the Pirate Captain marooned them, or they were left behind. There are no oars in this set, so they definitely&nbsp;won&#39;t be getting anywhere anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>B)</strong> A shark! Pirate themed lego seemed to try to fit a shark in almost all their sets big or small. A shark gives you something to help display...is the shark going to attack the raft? Do they even realise&nbsp;it&#39;s there? Gives the set a bit if an unknown and enemy to deal with.</p>

<p><strong>C)</strong> You get 4 brown barrels with matching lids! If you ever decide to take apart the set, there are many parts that can be used in other sets so that&#39;s a bonus. And if you leave the set intact these parts help make the set standout and seem like a real raft as well.</p>

<p><strong>D)</strong> A treasure map! One of the few small sets to have a treasure map, I think that&#39;s a big bonus since you don&#39;t get pirate treasure but then again these pirates failed at getting any treasure, so they are going to need a map to feel better.</p>

<p><strong>E)</strong> Cutlass and Flintlocks! This set comes with 2 swords, 2 pistols and a rifle with a flag on it which means these lost sailors are well-equipped for anything that might sneak up on them. Most Pirate sets never have a problem with not enough weapons and this set is no exception.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t play with this set but as a kid who would, and as an adult who has it on display this set is very good at doing both. The mast isn&#39;t very sturdy so it can bend and move around a lot which is the only problem I think this set would suffer from when being played with.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Your Money:</strong></p>

<p>Good value I think. I didn&#39;t buy it when it was $8.50 I bought it used for $20.00 but I&#39;m happy with the price considering this is a rare, old, first wave set that will be proudly displayed in my office.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Rating:</strong></p>

<p>Castaway&#39;s Raft was a really cool idea and a very fun set to build and own. It may not look like much for an adult but as a kid it would have been an inexpensive way to get your hands on something that almost resembled a pirate ship. The only thing I feel lacking in this set by todays standards is perhaps a cup, a pot for food and maybe something else for the pirates to do such as sleep, cook their meals or even try fishing but that wasn&#39;t the idea for Lego at the time and I can&#39;t fault them for it.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
