<p>Extra Dots series 4 is a decent subsequent pack, with some fantastic parts but with some generic filler pieces and reuse of pieces from previous, superior series&#39; .</p>

<p>The parts-&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this pack you get : three boring black 1&times;1 cheese slopes , three dull yellow&nbsp; 1&times;1 cheese slopes , three dull blue 1&times;1 cheese slopes , four less dull purple 1&times;1 cheese slopes and four interesting coral coloured cheese slopes . Also you get eight round 1&times;1 orange tiles , eight aqua coloured 1&times;1 round tiles , eight light yellow coloured round tiles , eight green 1&times;1 tiles , eight red 1&times;1 tiles , eight teele coloured 1&times;1 corner tiles and eight light azure coloured 1&times;1 corner tiles . Also you get eight 1&times;1 half round pink tiles , eight yellowish orange coloured 1&times;1 half round tiles , four 1&times;1 orange curves&nbsp; , four 1&times;1 light azure curves tiles , four 1&times;1 light tan curves and four 1&times;1 white curves . The printed &#39;surprise charms I got were two pause buttons , two swirly eyes , two closed eyes , one normal eye , one black circle eye , one crying eye , one yellow star , two open mouths , two licking mouths , one missing mouth and one moustache mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion -&nbsp;</p>

<p>dots series four, whilst not being bad, still is nowhere near as good as series 1 or 3, the re-use of pieces from series 1 and 2 along with these of common pieces is a great annoyance, but I wouldn&#39;t call this bad as I still recommend it&nbsp; to any owner of the dots of all series&#39; yet and this set made a good bonus to my 2021 May 4th order and I eagerly anticipate Dots&nbsp;series 5 releasing shortly .</p>

As always, the bulk of the dots are unprinted circles, &quot;teeth,&quot; and &quot;cheese wedges&quot; within a common color palette. The reason you get this pack, however, is the eyes, mouths, and noses (and the odd emoji) for assembling animal faces.</p>

<p>Dots 3 will always stand out for me in venturing into new territory, but Dots 4 is a lot of fun if you enjoy making mosaic faces.</p>
