The focus of the magazine is on education of young lego fans about a certain topic as well as teaching new and interesting building techniques with tips written by LEGO designers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This issue is called &ldquo;Incredible Insects&rdquo; and focuses on various building techniques for making custom bug MOCs (including non-insect builds) as well as a lot of educational material about insects and arthropods in general. The issue&#39;s Brick Master section focuses on the 30377 &ldquo;Mech&nbsp;Arm&rdquo; part, which is used for this set&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
I feel that since the focus of the magazine is on education about insects and build techniques with the arm part, the set feels somewhat lacking. It has no mandibles or even visible eyes like a real ant and the transparent dish piece feels very out of place. The arm is used only as legs and not in any other way - attaching the abdomen with one would have made sense as ants can have very thin waists that way. I would also perhaps introduce some upside-down building techniques for the head or abdomen.<br />
The build does at least make a good example of showing the difference between head, thorax and abdomen in an insect.<br />
<br />
The parts are good. The aforementioned trans-red 43898 3x3 Inverted Dish only appears in two other sets which are much more expensive than this.&nbsp;Dark red 2540 modified plates with bar are fairly hard to come by, and the set also includes some very useful round elements and the aforementioned arm parts &mdash; six are included plus one spare.<br />
<br />
All in all the parts are nice, but I would have liked to see a more accurate insect build for something intended to be educational for children.</p>
