<p>The dolphin is nearly eight studs long and is a nose longer than the paddle board that the minifig comes with.&nbsp; It can be connected to Lego studs with space on the bottom of the body and the tail for display.&nbsp; The only printing on the dolphin are the eyes but that&#39;s all it needs since the peice is so well designed with contours on the sides and detail on the beak and dorsal fin. There is even a spot on the top from the manufacturing process where the blowhole should be.&nbsp; It&#39;s a wonderful addition to the world of Lego animals.</p>

<p>The minifig has dual-molded legs to represent a wetsuit, and even has printing on the front waistband for the drawstring of the pants.&nbsp; She has printing on the front and back of the torso with a print of a dolphin skipping out of the water on the front that looks like she got it from a local souvenir street vendor on her vacation and the same logo on the back that is printed on the board.&nbsp; Her head has two faces printed, with and without sunglasses.&nbsp; The hat and ponytail piece is dual-molded as well.&nbsp; A removable blue lifevest is included which is a nice update on previous lifevests Lego has produced.</p>

<p>The paddle board is designed nicely with coral and black stripes and logo.&nbsp; A paddle obviously is included for our minifig to move herself on the board in the water.&nbsp; The standard CMF stand 4x3 plate is also included.</p>

<p>This minifigure clearly has a tone of play possibilities and looks great compared to many other minifigs.&nbsp; <em>I don&#39;t own all of the CMF figs, but I highly recommend this one!</em></p>
