<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Minifigure Itself</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Let&rsquo;s start at the top. The hairpiece is really not uncommon; it&rsquo;s in at least 47 sets, but the face is quite good, and perfect for the character. Either it&rsquo;s out of tune, or it&rsquo;s perfect, that&rsquo;s the dichotomy, and it&rsquo;s captured perfectly.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Now the Blacktron shirt and the green hoodie, this is perfect. There&rsquo;s been Blacktron shirt torsos before, but I&rsquo;ve missed out on all those, so this is great to get, really for anyone who wants a Blacktron shirt.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Then you&rsquo;ve got blue short legs. Nothing fancy, nothing fancy.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Accessories</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The violin is obviously the main reason to get this, and it does not disappoint. It even has two places to grip for playing or for holding by the neck, which is really perfect.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Harry Potter wand as the bow is a great idea. I would&rsquo;ve hoped for maybe something more specialised, but at this scale that&rsquo;s also not really achievable.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:italic"">End</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This is truly just a must-have. It may just be a minifigure, but the combo of the violin and the Blacktron shirt make it just what I expect from a CMF series.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""white-space: pre-wrap;"">5 stars</span></p>
