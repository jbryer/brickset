<p>This is one of the twelve CMFs released in January this year, and one of the three Minifigures I actually like, as my destain for series 21 runs deep but just is not at all relevant in an individual review.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure uses the cave man scruffy beard and hair combo in dark brown, his head features a surprisingly happy face with stubble around the edges but more concentrated facial hair around the mouth, the torso features a scarred shirtless design with a seashell necklace and one arm has a tattoo print of an anchor and the legs are dual moulded with torn blue trousers with more weathering detail.</p>

<p>The accessories-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accessories include a trans green bottle with a note inside, printed on the outside, but the more interesting of the two is a hermit crab, a new mould in orange with the eyes printed, the back features a bar attaching a 1&times;1 hollow white stud with a white version of the faeces piece introduced in series 19 with the dog trainer. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This figure is a one of good quality with the majority of interest coming from the accessories particularly the hermit crab, however I still believe the ancient warrior and beekeeper are superior figures from the series, however compared to the other 9 Minifigures from this overhyped, uninventive series it is very good, so that is why I recommend it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Also the number of reviews written by me recently is unsatisfactory for myself and a massive decline compared to this time a year ago, so I plan to get back into the flow of reviews by doing at least one a week for the rest of the year.)</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Attire.</b> A mere rope tied around the minifigure&rsquo;s waist holds up a pair of ragged shorts, suggesting a frayed social fabric. As a symbol of public decency, the decrepitude of his garment and his imminent nakedness represent the deterioration of civil society and the boundaries of acceptable behavior. Alas, the minifigure appears unable or unwilling to face these problems, as signaled by the shell necklace he&rsquo;s made for himself, a pathetic gesture of consolatory and self-deceived <i>vanitas</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Accessories.</b> The minifigure&rsquo;s hermit crab, some species or other of <i>Coenobita</i>, suggests the utter inadequacy of the natural environment to support human overpopulation. In his other hand the minifigure holds a message in a bottle. The minute chance of its success forcibly imposes upon us the futility of hope, and the innate emptiness of individual acts. All is vanity and nullity. As an aesthetic object, the message implies the impossibility of artistic consolation in the face of overwhelming calamities.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Setting.</b> Has the minifigure really survived a shipwreck, or does the set&rsquo;s name conceal a darker history in which he has been marooned? Either way, his solitary existence indicates a total lack of solutions to pressing problems, and in a broader sense his inability to communicate with others in a meaningful way.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">71029-3 offers a bleak analysis of the quandaries that we face, and a critique of our collective refusal to address them. Three stars.</span></span></span></p>
