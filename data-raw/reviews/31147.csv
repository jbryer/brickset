I was delighted, therefore, to find out that Series 21 would include a centaur to easily obtain one of those bodies...even if the character wasn&#39;t interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The Centaur Warrior&#39;s biggest draw, of course, is her horse lower body. It&#39;s a well-sculpted piece with a neutral yet interesting pose that stands nicely on a baseplate, has a dual-molded tail, and two studs on the back for storage or for carrying more humanoid minifigure riders. Otherwise, you get a bow and quiver, which are fairly common, a red apple, which is less so than the green ones, and a pretty applicable torso, hairpiece (new or at least uncommon in brown) and head.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>This character just doesn&#39;t excite me. The Centaur Warrior is clearly meant to be part of the woodland characters that include the Elf from Series 3 and the Series 9 Forest Maiden, but this direction is not only less exciting to me than a classical Greek one, but the execution itself feels by far the most generic of the forest folk. This&nbsp;looks like a typical friendly LEGO City character from the neck up, when she ought to have a new hair sculpt or a more fantastical aura, and she should probably look more imposing if she&#39;s a warrior.&nbsp;If they were going to go with the woodland theme of previous characters, they ought to have gone the extra mile. I can understand why they&#39;d think a shirtless male centaur warrior would repeat the Harry Potter figures&#39; concept, but the different direction they chose isn&#39;t done to its best. I do really like her arm prints and I&#39;m charmed by the way all of LEGO&#39;s centaurs wear their quivers on their horse bodies, but I feel no loss in using the horse piece to create my own centaur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>While this figure is one of the weaker ones design-wise, there&#39;s no arguing that the opportunity to get a centaur body in a CMF release is very generous of LEGO and something that shouldn&#39;t be missed. Full recommend because she&#39;s all useful parts, even if not a dazzling whole.</p>

The torso print is nice as well and has a bit of wrist printing but is nothing special. The face is ok but nothing super unique. The bow makes sense as does the apple, but the red apple piece is not a super great accessory in my opinion. The hair piece has been used before and cannot be turned when the characters head is sideways which stinks because that is how they are to hold the bow, I think it should have come with a different hairpiece which could be worn when the head is turned to the side. Most likely you are getting this set for the legs which is the best part about it.&nbsp;</p>
