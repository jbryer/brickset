<p>A brand new element with this minifigure is the helmet which is dual-molded of white and transparent dark grey for the face opening to recreate the mesh of a beekeeper helmet.&nbsp; The helmet is a wonderful representation but the transparent plastic is kind of distorted so his face isn&#39;t sharp.&nbsp; I would have been just as happy with trans-clear but it is what it is.&nbsp; The beekeepers head has two faces printed, one with his toungue sticking out and apparently licking his lips in anticipation of pure honey.</p>

<p>Accessories include a 2x2 tile printed with a honeycomb design as the honey frame removed from the beehive - it&#39;s an excellent decoration.&nbsp; Also included is his smoker which is simply a minifigure cup held upside down attached to the minifigure &quot;action stand&quot; that was introduced in the DC Comics CMF line with the flying figures. The combined pieces make a great beehive smoker.&nbsp; This also comes with the standard 4x3 plate to stand and display your CMF.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
I obviously love this minifig for sentimental reasons but he is great in his own right and will fit in to any Lego town or farm display and he will be a hit with children to play with as well. For all the female beekeepers, swap the head and you&#39;re all set! I highly recommend this one!</p>

<p><strong>Rating notes:</strong><br />
While my overall rating is 5 stars because I love this minifigure, I give CMFs only 1 star for building experience because there&#39;s nothing to build - that&#39;s not a slam on the line, just my opinion. The value for money rating is neutral for me because I object to Lego raising the prices of the CMF series by 25% last year. Lego sets are already overpriced so asking more for the CMF bags is a poke in the eye of parents and collectors.</p>

That is the only issue the top of the Smoker is Light Stone Gray while the Mug is Silver looks a little funny. I&nbsp;would have rather the Smoker one colour or the other, not both. The only other weird part is the choice of glove color being the darker red,&nbsp;But otherwise a very detailed minifigure.&nbsp;</p>
