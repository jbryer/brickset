"TeddytheSpoon","2021-02-20T14:05:25.593Z","A great figure to complement previous CMFs","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Ancient Warrior is one of the most striking of the 21<sup>st</sup> series of CMFs. The concept is very similar to the Aztec Warrior included in series 7, and indeed features many of the same hallmarks &ndash; a shield, a weapon, limited clothing and an impressive headdress. However several worthwhile updates have been applied since the last iteration 9 years ago, most notably in the form of added printed detail. The latest warrior features body paint that extends to the back of the figure, as well as a double-sided head featuring confident and warmongering expressions. The blue highlights dotted on the figure, headdress and shield make for an attractive aesthetic and helps the figure pop a little. Speaking of the shield, the newer domed shape makes an appearance here, alongside a new club-cum-sword (called a macuahuitl) made especially for this figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Verdict: </b>an impressive and attractive figure in its own right, not only providing a welcome update to an older figure, but acting as a superb complement to it for long-time collectors and fans of Mesoamerican history. <b>9/10</b></p>

"ForestMenOfEndor","2021-09-27T19:35:26.793Z","My favorite non-licensed minifigure . . . ever?","<p>The &quot;Ancient Warrior&quot; has it all. Awesome cultural references.&nbsp;A great colour scheme combining dark red and medium azure (?) to striking effect. Two useful&nbsp;expressions.&nbsp;Printing EVERYWHERE. Excellent accessories, including the&nbsp;macuahuitl (a wooden club studded with obsidian blades), an amazing headdress and a lovely new shield for the consummate shield collector. The Ancient Warrior represents, looks cool and is a perfect army builder. Now I just need to find the Aztec Warrior from Series 7. . . .</p>
