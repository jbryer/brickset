"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-04T22:01:16Z","great, but i am not going to play with it for a looooooooooong time...","in its true form. within minutes, i combined it with Imperial Cannon (small fortified British dock [i took the red flag and replaced it with a blue one] that comes in Value Pack) and other pieces that i had laying around, most of which are from Imperial Outpost, a set which i bought when i was 6 or 7 and was destroyed. now it is a small but beefy bastion. it looks soooooo cool. i'm serius. if it didn't have so obvius a facade of Broadside's Brig and Imperial Cannon, i would submit it to Lego magazine.
the set comes with a commander (tricorne hat) and a soldier (shako hat), as well as an inmate (pirate with red bandana). the jail cell is cool, but leaves no space for the person to stand. you just have to attach his hands to the bars then push him down onto the smooth surface of the inside of the jail door, or leave him hovering. Pirates aren't exactly renowned hoverers, so i would recommend allowing the pirate to stand on the floor. the space between the brig and the tower-like structure is cool, but looks like it could use a cannon. it is also kind of wierd how there is nothing on the back side, and no way for anybody to get to the top floors of the  tower and the jail cell - not even a ladder. i added one, then combined it with Imperial Cannon to make my fort... it is soo unbelievably cool that i want you to see it, who ever you are.
this set is a great set. it can be built into bigger and better things, or left the way it is. awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T22:55:45Z","Some tiny problems......","     This set, along with most of the Imperial guards series, is a-okay!  The tiny jail cell in this doesnt have a back to it, so it should be placed against a wall or make a door to convert it to reality. I like the guards uniforms and cool tophats. L like the muskets too. The small watchtower isnt really the tallest thing in the world, but if this is the only imperial guards set you own, than it would have to do! The prate is cool and so is the bird! You get two guards and a pirate, plus a small jail building! It is a pleasant set top have!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-22T10:50:51Z","Northern Star obviously doesn't have this set.","if you're gonna review a set, make sure you HAVE the set. Northern Star, there is a back to the brig. it's a jail cell door. it has a jail cell with a back, and there aren't any &quot;tiny problems&quot;. that review just came from a guy who doesn't know what he's talking about. don't fret, kiddies, this set rocks, as i said.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-09-12T06:05:03.81Z","Worst soldier building... but still four stars!","Let me first state that I'm a bluecoat fanatic. Blue is my favourite colour and so I immediately fell in love with the Imperial Soldiers. As a plus, most of their sets were also wonderful. Especially the buildings with the surprisingly fresh combination of white and yellow blocks, often accompanied by some pieces of blue water and green vegetation. Except for those last parts, everything also holds for this set: Broadside's Brig. 

What keeps it from five stars however, is not only the lack of some 'natural' elements, but also the lack of creativity this set seems to have. To me, it seems just like a smaller version of Lagoon Lock-up, with a jail on one side and 'something else' on the other side. That 'something else' had a clear function in Lagoon Lock-up (a bar) but here it seems lego only added it to give the set some more 'body'.

I admit the set still looks pretty cool (except for the visible grey plate through the arc on the right), the parts are good (two soldiers, a pirate, a parrot, lots of weapons and a flag), but I would say it's the least appealing building in the whole soldier/guard line-up. Maybe a little shop or something (like we have in the lego castle series) would have been a better idea.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-19T14:16:38.793Z","YAY!","I purchased this set off of bricklink two days ago and picked it up today. (The seller lives 5 minutes away.) It's a bit ironic seein' as today, Sept. 19, be International Talk Like a Pirate Day! AAARRRRR! Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me! Anyway, this set is a very neat little fort. It comes with a parrot, weapons, a flag, and three figs. (They are Lt. de Martinet, a grunt, and the pirate, who for no particular reason I call &quot;Lefty&quot;.) The brig is pretty small and cramped, but I don't expect that the Soldiers are going to pamper one of their sworn enemies. The only problem is that the rest of the fort is rather small and doesn't offer enough room for scuffles should the pirate escape. Also, the section in the middle between the tower and the brig seems kind of bare. They could have at least thrown in a cannon.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-09-16T16:29:30.81Z","Nice little brig","This set could be used as a small outpost, to hold a not very dangerous pirate criminal or hostage. Although it is a smaller version of the Lagoon Lockup, I still think it's nice none the less. We get three figures: a blue soldier, a blue officer and a parrot. The flag is also nice. It's not large though but a nice cheap add-on set, to get another brig.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-30T21:35:48.04Z","Broadside's Brig Review","<p>This is one of the smaller old Imperial Sets featuring the Blue Soldiers. The price was good for a set this size and a kid saving up their own money to get. Just that afterwords, I always felt this should have been part of&nbsp;a larger set. Regardless I alway imagined it as being located on a cliff size guarding the entrance to a port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a quick and easy build, though fun. Two Imperial Soldiers and a captive pirate, a parrot. Plenty there for a small play and adding onto other sets for bigger scenarios.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-24T17:18:34.82Z","Pirate Prison Outpost","<p>Set #6259 Broadside's Brig: This set was one of my favorites as a child, alas I no longer own it though am looking forward to picking it up again eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Broadside's Brig is a small model, I tried to build a version of this using some of the extra parts I still have in my collection, but lacked enough replacement parts to create the model properly.&nbsp;It is however a fun and simple build, and a great miniature pirate prison from LEGO's Pirates Theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set includes two Imperial Soldiers and one Pirate Prisoner, I loved the Pirates Mini-Figures a lot, they looked quite unique compared to the Town and other Mini-Figures in my collection. They looked really good next to Castle Mini-Figs too when building and playing with armies of the Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, as a nostalgic adult fan of the Pirates Theme I can't get enough Pirates sets, and this would have made an excellent troop builder for Imperial Soldiers back in the day. I reccomend this set to fellow Pirates enthusiasts, it is one of only a few sets that included the tri-corner wall piece in that distinct yellow color.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-07-18T20:46:42.12Z","Once more into the brig. ","The early pirates may have had the cooler ships, but it was the soldiers of the generic Imperial Navy that had the infrastructure to support its oceanic conquests. Much like the modern-day police force of the LEGO City, the Imperial Navy's administration seems to have decided that the best way to operate a peacekeeping force is to have as many jails as possible, presumably with the notion that those criminal scum can somehow be rehabilitated if locked up in inhumane conditions for long enough.<div><br></div><div>Just kidding! Once they throw a pirate in there, that's where that pirate stays until execution, unless, of course, he gets busted out - which is quite likely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Broadside's Brig is one of several smaller Imperial sets that focuses on a building as opposed to a vessel, and I must have been particularly attracted to these little Imperial bases as a kid because I recall having a ton of them (which have all been sadly sold off in the intervening years, but oh well). This is a compact set, but it doesn't ""feel"" small by any means - you get a fully functional outpost, two Imperial soldiers, and one pirate, which comprises a very complete package that any Pirates fan is sure to enjoy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Minifigs here aren't particularly special, though that's not to say that they aren't awesome, because all of the Pirates Minifigs are awesome. I tend to assume that the bearded Imperial Minifig is actually Governor Broadside (did I read that in a LEGO comic somewhere?), and he is accompanied by a loyal foot soldier. You know, when I was kid, I never bothered to think about which nation these soldiers are supposed to represent, and I guess the idea is that they're supposed to be generic enough that they could be anyone. The unfortunate pirate, on the other hand, has no allies to help him out here, so you're going to need to enlist the help of your other pirates if he's ever to survive this ordeal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This set has an incredibly simple build using very simple pieces, but I find that it doesn't look at all dated and could work very well still as part of a larger Imperial coastal fortress. I've always loved the white and yellow colour scheme adopted for the Imperial structures, and I find it to be very evocative of an age of colonial buildings and fortresses that you can still find all over the world, legacies of a global European rampage that, for better or for worse, changed the face of the planet forever. Anyway, this brig is perfectly coherent with Eldorado Fortress (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6276-1"">6275</a> - implying that these soldiers are Spanish? Makes sense, since we did get conquistador-type helmets later on) and any of the other Imperial buildings, so it works as an add-on to a larger structure if you don't like it sitting all by itself. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This set has a pretty low piececount and not too many specialised pieces, so you may have some luck cobbling the set together from multiple sources. If your goal is to come up with a proper Imperial outpost for your trigger-happy soldiers, you should feel immediately compelled to pick up this set or at least use it as inspiration to construct your own brig. This is definitely a wonderful small set from a bygone era, and I should probably end this right here before my nostalgia goggles start fogging up.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,5
"James83","2021-07-26T15:44:21.223Z","Small Jail Big Potential","<p>This was a small building set, equivalent to the smaller Town sets like&nbsp;6350&nbsp;Pizza To Go in size and cost. Its eye catching, has three minifigs and was a relatively inexpensive set to purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Building</strong></p>

<p>The building rests on a 6x16 flat brick as a baseplate, so is quite dinky. On this small space the designers managed to achieve a cell and a small room. On the left is a cell,&nbsp;basically a standard barred door frame&nbsp;backing onto a wall, allowing just enough room for one minifigure to stand inside. The front wall is built from yellow bricks with some nice angled bricks and four antenna bricks are cleverly used with an arch brick to form a barred window. A headlight brick is used to hold a torch with a yellow cone as the flame. The roof of the cell is an observation position with a&nbsp;crenellated wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cell is linked to the other building with a&nbsp;crenellated&nbsp;arch and a small wall. The second building is a small room with a doorway and a large arched window space to the front. The construction is very basic with a 3x3x6 corner brick with printed brick pattern and two 1x2 column bricks. The back and right-hand side are open to allow access for the player. The room inside is bare with nothing inside it. The space is small, even putting a treasure chest in here fills it. The partial roof (only one&nbsp;2x4 and one&nbsp;1x4 brick)&nbsp;is another observation post and an antenna brick forms a short flagpole for a printed Imperial flag. A&nbsp;clip brick is provided at the rear of the roof for a rifle.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with three minifigures,&nbsp;A standard Imperial Officer, a standard Imperial soldier with a backpack and an unlucky pirate prisoner with grey legs, blue striped vest torso with belt, a head with a moustache and stubble and a red bandanna.</p>

<p>The soldiers are armed with two flintlock rifles and flintlock pistol.</p>

<p>A Parrot is also included.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This set looks good and is colourful but was really pushing the boundaries given the tiny baseplate. The cell looked great and is functional, but the second building is tiny and bare. The set is fun and playable on its own, you get enough figures and defences to stage a decent pirate raid to bust their matey from the cell. But it never quite feels like a bastion like some of the Imperial outposts do. Think of this set as a starter, you can easily extend this set if you add further grey flats as bases or transfer the building to a larger baseplate. I added a larger roof and a ladder for access, it&#39;s possible to extend the building on the right and&nbsp;add some furniture or equipment racks inside. So it&#39;s definitely worth purchasing and is solid set within the Pirate range.</p>
