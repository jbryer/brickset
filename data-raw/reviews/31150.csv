"Minifig290","2021-01-19T10:28:54.587Z","Love the Aeroplane","<p>Hello, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at one of the twelve LEGO Minifigures 71029 Series 21 figures released in January 2021. Retailing at &pound;3.49/$4.99 a pack and containing an average of 8 pieces. The figure I&#39;ll be looking at is the Airplane Girl which contains 9 pieces, giving her a price per piece of 38p/55c.</p>

<p>Lets take a look</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the Airplane&nbsp;Girl herself, she is quite basic compared to others in the series. She has a pair of unprinted dark blue mini-legs, then her dark blue torso is printed with a jacket that has some aviation pins on the front and at the back is a print for a logo that has some propellers in a gold and brown print.</p>

<p>She has an exclusive double-sided face, both sides have a small bit of dirt or maybe a little scar to her face on her right cheek which I&#39;m not quite sure why there is. The first side has hair smiling and the other side has her quite chipper. Finally, for the minifigure she has a nougat ponytail&nbsp;hair piece which is a fairly common piece now.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>Airplane girl has two accessories, the aeroplane piece and an aviators hat. The aviators hat is made using a dark brown hat piece that has been seen before with a pair of dark tan goggles added onto the pieces, you get an extra of the goggle piece in the pack as well.</p>

<p>Now the main event imo, the aeroplane piece is a new large mould for 2021 that is quite big, the red piece has a space to connect the piece to the hip of a Minifigure, there are three studs on on the piece, on at the front and one on each wing. The bottom of the piece is hollow with no anti-studs. At the front of the plane is a mini-doll accessory sized pin where you place a small propeller piece in black, you get an extra of this propeller piece. This aeroplane piece is close in design and scale to the car that the Race Driver had in Series 18.</p>

<p>This figure like all the other figures has a 3x4 black minifigure stand base plate as well.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Out of the 12 minifigures in this series this figure is on of the best ones. The areoplane piece is amazing and one I would love to see in more colours in the future. The figure herself is imo a bit on the bland side but does have all useful pieces so can&#39;t complain there.</p>

<p>Pros - Aeroplane piece, printed torso, helmet</p>

<p>Cons - Would have liked some print on the legs</p>
