"8BrickMario","2021-01-09T18:29:06.367Z","A welcome update and some awkward nostalgia.","<p><em>Space Police III</em>&nbsp;was the first LEGO theme I really started collecting with focus after getting into LEGO&nbsp;as a kid of around seven years old. I loved the alien figures most of all, and I have very fond memories of the theme. So I was especially excited to see the theme&#39;s history be represented with an officer and alien criminal...even though recent history made those things a little strange to digest. If you&#39;re not here for that kind of reflection, feel free to pass on this review. In short, it&#39;s a good figure if that&#39;s the only opinion you want to hear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The Space Police Guy comes with some pretty nice pieces, though many of them lose some versatility with their prints.&nbsp;There&#39;s the new helmet sculpt, which accommodates a standard visor, here in translucent red, and has some black flex material sculpted on the back, the galaxy bulletproof armor in gunmetal grey, a police shield, black handcuffs, and a lightsaber hilt and blue bulb. The head is generic enough to be used for almost anyone. Spares are also included for the visor, cuffs, hilt, and bulb.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>The weird thing that sticks out now about&nbsp;<em>Space Police III</em>&nbsp;is that the good guys were universally human and the criminals were all aliens, and this series of minifigures recreates that dynamic. This has become increasingly odd for me as an American due to exposure of real-life police biases and crimes, and the fact that this officer is equipped in riot gear feels even more uncomfortable due to the exposure of overzealous riot control in response to protests against police abuses. Since toys take time to develop and finalize, this minifigure is surely coincidental and a victim of very bad timing, but it&#39;s difficult to ignore nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, I think this is a good minifigure when isolated from real-world cultural context. It&#39;s a nice update of the classic Space Police officer uniforms, made even more apparent by his jumpsuit under the armor being a direct upgrade of the design used back then. The new helmet is well sculpted and I really like the way the colors work, save, perhaps, the gunmetal armor which would have looked better in black. This is the first Space Police officer I&#39;ve seen that actually strikes me as a good design, since the ones I knew as a kid were plain boring and didn&#39;t look very spacey. I like this updated take on the original. The faces also don&#39;t feel quite right, since this looks like a very young officer and is hard to take seriously, but at the same time, I welcome the way his innocent looks take the edge off the armor and shield. He can also be easy dequipped of his shield to just look like a sci-fi cop in a spacesuit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Is this minifigure a well-designed, attractive tribute to the history of a Classic Space theme? Yes. Is it also poorly-timed in an era where police&#39;s heroic reputation has seriously been damaged, being seen as biased and overmilitarized? Also yes. What you do with it is really up to you. I don&#39;t think this toy harms anybody, but I won&#39;t tell anybody they&#39;re wrong for refusing to buy it, either. Maybe none of this discussion is welcome, but this is my review and what I considered. I like the figure, and it reminds me of my start with LEGO. Yet I can&#39;t deny the awkwardness it brings today.</p>

<p><strong>The minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>This minifigure has a nicely updated Space Police jacket with front zipper, the Classic Space logo on his chest and a design with the word &quot;police&quot; printed on his back.&nbsp; The dual-molded black and white legs nicely depict his boots and kneepads that I&#39;m sure come in handy when kneeling on the rocky lunar surfaces he patrols.&nbsp; He also has a gold belt buckle printed on the hip piece.&nbsp; His head has two face printings: one an updated classic smiley face and the other a stern face.&nbsp; A new helmet piece has been released with this minifigure that is mostly white with air intakes on the front bottom and top and a dual-molded black section in the back of the helmet.&nbsp; He also has a transparent red visor that lifts up and down like the classic helmet.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong><br />
The attention-getter is the new shield piece with the police badge printed on the front.&nbsp; Unlike other shields of the Viking, Knights or other historic lines with a handle just the size of the minifigure hand, this shield&#39;s handle is the width of the shield which allows it to be displayed concealing or exposing more of the minifigure. With four studs on the front of the shield, it can be decorated or added on with other pieces to create a variety of configurations.</p>

<p>The other highlight is the new body armor piece that looks quite futuristic in this pearl dark grey color with the Classic Space logo printed on the front.&nbsp; It also has two clips on the back to hold accessories.</p>

<p>Other accessories include a pistol, handcuffs, and a stunning baton made of a lightsaber hilt with a transparent blue bulb.&nbsp; The bag also includes a spare handcuff, lightsaber hilt, bulb and visor as well as the standard 4x3 plate to stand and display your minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
I love this updated Space Police minifigure for the design and amount of accessories.&nbsp; While the official piece count says &quot;10&quot; pieces, this actually has 15 pieces with the extras. Even if you don&#39;t need the police in your blissful utopian space station display, this minifigure will make a welcome addition to your Classic Space crew by swapping the helmet, shield and police accessories for any other implements in your Lego collection. I definitely recommend this minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Rating notes:</strong><br />
While my overall rating is 5 stars because I love this minifigure, I give CMFs only 1 star for building experience because there&#39;s nothing to build - that&#39;s not a slam on the line, just my opinion.</p>
