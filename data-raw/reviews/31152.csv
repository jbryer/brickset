"8BrickMario","2021-01-09T18:51:49.897Z","A nice throwback and useful character.","<p>As mentioned in my review of the Space Police Guy, collecting&nbsp;<em>Space Police III</em>&#39;s alien figures was one of the early passions in my LEGO collecting story. So naturally, I had to have this one&nbsp;too, who I think carries far less cultural awkwardness than his cop counterpart.</p>

<p>(But their name is really bland. Surprisingly, they haven&#39;t gone for plain &quot;Alien&quot; before, but maybe the name&#39;s&nbsp;boringness was why.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The Alien&#39;s parts are pretty good. The head is actually pretty well applicable to any kind of body despite the breathing apparatus, and the torso pieces are also easily put on anybody with a swap of hands. The CHI crystal is a bit dull without a new color, but the gunmetal crowbar is really neat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>Aliens were always the bad guys in <em>Space Police</em>, and that dynamic is referenced in this minifigure series. Uncomfortable, but I think the police side makes it more so, and I&#39;m perfectly happy to have this alien. Since LEGO&#39;s stopped doing bios for the Minifigures, this is one of the characters whose gender isn&#39;t clear. Given that LEGO tends to give stereotypical features to female nonhumans, I&#39;d guess this is a guy, but we don&#39;t have confirmation. The&nbsp;head is an intriguing sculpt, really feeling on the level&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Space Police</em>&nbsp;by not having classic tones or reusing parts&nbsp;but instead feeling like a whole new alien species. The head is round and squat at the front and longer at the back, with shiny black eyes, ridges&nbsp;down the middle and back, and&nbsp;reptilian spines and printed scales&nbsp;at the back. I think it&#39;d have been more fun if the head was as cylindrical as it looked from the front, but it&#39;s nice.&nbsp;The entire lower head and front is enclosed in a black breathing apparatus, making the alien more mysterious and nearly&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;in tone. The front of the apparatus does come onto the torso and restrict head rotation, but I still like it. The alien&#39;s jumpsuit is welcomely neutral, allowing them to be anything from a pilot to a worker to (per tradition) an escaped prisoner. The figure is printed on all sides with subtle but sharp details, with elements of mesh/armor and canisters of fluid or gas hooked up to them on the back.&nbsp;I also like that the hands are bare, since Bright Green is still a fairly uncommon minifigure color. The alien&#39;s accessories are a CHI crystal that hasn&#39;t been changed in color (yellow, red, orange, or even neon green would have been much more exciting) and a crowbar, presumably used in theft or escape, but maybe impromptu mining. Let&#39;s give &#39;em the benefit of the doubt, since LEGO hasn&#39;t a bio to clarify. I like this minifigure design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts:</h2>

<p>It&#39;s a little weird and maybe disappointing that the concept of this new entry into the list of CMF aliens is &quot;bad guy joining the list of all-alien&nbsp;<em>Space Police</em>&nbsp;crooks&quot;, but it&#39;s left ambiguous and independent enough to be whatever you want and is a really nice figure besides. It makes me hope for a less species-divided revisit to the&nbsp;<em>Space Police</em>&nbsp;theme because it brings back a lot of childhood nostalgia.</p>

"FineSeaSalt","2021-01-21T19:20:46.873Z","Gordon Freeman I presume?","<p>My immediate thought when I saw this minifigure was that, despite the alien head; the torso printing, the crystal and the crowbar put me in mind of Gordon Freeman from the Half-Life series. Was this Lego&#39;s intention? Perhaps or perhaps not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But out of a plethora of other items that the could have given him like a blaster they chose a crowbar. If it was red perhaps it wouls have been too on the nose?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think it is great minifigure and one of the highlights of Season 21.</p>
