"legotrainfan","2007-10-21T12:55:59.56Z","Always needed","There's not so much to say about this baseplate. When you want to build a house, a castle or whatever, you always need it. Apart from using it for buildings, you can also use it to create parks and forests. And I like its size, which I believe is perfect. This is the biggest baseplate in green. It shouldn't be bigger. There's a bigger one in gray, but the bigger they are, the easier it is for children to damage them. Cracks can occur.   
        Of course, this baseplate was also available in blue (627), but LEGO does not produce blue ones anymore, which is a pity.

"sijpe","2008-07-12T14:24:06.483Z","It's something to begin with","Like the other reviewers I'm having a hard time trying to conjure up a serious review on this 'set'. It's a basic neccessity, a startingground. Without it you're building castles in the air; which is a nice pastime in itself, but just not when you're working with actual lego bricks.

If I'd have to say anything sensible about this plate, it would be that I think this plate is probably better suited for the knights-theme than for lego town. If you'd use merely one of these plates in your town, it will have the same impact on the overall view of the town as Central Park has on Manhattan. And one should leave it at that.
Using more than one of these plates in your town would be a waste of valuable building space and would seriously anger your construction workers and the real-estate brokers.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-05T23:28:04.717Z","Green Baseplate 32 x 32","I do not particulary like this baseplate. It is too small for whatever you want to use it for, but it is the most grassy colour in lego history. I am not sure what lego intended for us to use it for, but I don’t think they were quite with it at the moment. 

I got this set with everything else as a bulk lot, and I wouldn’t have bought it myself. For those who want this set, I suggest the X-large baseplate, but if you want something grassy then this will have to do. If it is the biggest green baseplate you can find, then you would probably have to get a lot of them, but it is really not worth the money. 

If you want this to make a grassy scene for a brickfilm, I suggest you use actual grass, and if you need studs then stick this in the middle of a load of grass. If you want this set for whatever reason you have to find a better one, a bigger one. Use this as a last resort, because it is not worthwhile.

Really I think that this is only useful setting a small scene of nothing. Grass comes in useful once in a while but really it is not a good set. You can get baseplates with rivers rinning through them, this is probably better because you can just add a river anyway, you have lego bricks! This goes for lego sets with roads also. I think that there are large sandy baseplates as well that suits for underwater and really only you would know what you want to buy this for and whether it is a good buy or not. 

Let’s face it, 32 by 32 is way too small. The X-Large grey baseplate may be a tad small as well. But, if you get a lot of them grouped together, then it makes it seem a bit bigger. Though, as I said, in reality, one costs you a bit. Two costs too much, though. Four costs you way too much and eight is too big a figure. Buy one of these sets, if at all. If you need any more please use actual grass, and if you haven’t got any then I suppose you can buy another of this. Just remember I do not recommend it. 

Overall this is not worth buying and if you find it at a lowish price then you may buy it. Really I suggest that you find something better, but I suppose that there are worse sets out there, and this one I found hard to review because it is pretty boring and has no importance in my lego collection. Also I do not like it, would rather have another grey X-large baseplate. Really only you know whether it is a good deal or not, everything is there and if you expect more out of it then you will not be amused. This is a good spare baseplate because for me it’s life purpose in my collection is to sit around doing nothing at all. Do not buy this set unless it is absolutely necessary, trust it from me, this is a waste of money, even to lego’s standards.

Pros:
32 by 32. Lots of space for your legos.
Green color. Good or bad depending on the set you're making.-Pro or Con
Pretty Cheap.
Connect to other plates with your legos.
Makes your creations look nice.
small, easy to transport.
Can be used to transport other fragile sets.

There isn't much else to say. This set is worth the money by far.

Enjoy!

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-13T10:50:08.41Z","Base Plates, Everyone Needs Them","<p>Set #626 Bulding Plate, Green: My brother and I wanted another Base Plate to use in our building, so we convinced our parents to spend the money on this item. Back in the 90's this piece was quite well priced... I look at the base plates/building plates prices these days and wonder why I'd waste that kind of money on them when I could just pick up a small set or Battle Pack from SW for that price instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I say about a Building Plate in a review? It's great for any type of MOCing, mine has unfortunately seen better days, its covered in grime and sticky mess from spilled soda pops, dust and other things, and some sections of the plate no longer want to hold onto the bricks when you put them down. I think replacing it with a newer one might not be such a bad idea, but it'll have to wait for when I get some spare cash that I can throw into such a purchase... Or TRU holds a 50% off Building Plates sale, which probably won't ever happen. SIGH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can have endless hours of fun with one of these and a bucket full of bricks. (And as soon as I remember which bucket of bricks we also bought at the time I'll review that one too.) If you're looking for something to build floors with for forests or fields or even just a grassy area surrounding your building, you can't go wrong with the Green Building Plate. That's why this gets a five brick rating for parts, alone it is of course useless, but combined with all your LEGO pieces the parts are endless, the builds are endless, the playability is endless, but I gave it a three because after all you're only buying the plate not the pieces to go with it so honestly you can't do much with it without the other pieces from LEGO sets/collections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pick one up. Pick two up if they're cheap. Anybody know some tricks to restoring these things to pristine looking order without damaging them? I fear if I try and wash it clean then mine will suffer even worse than it does now.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
