<p>At &pound;3.99 in the UK, Issue 34 of the Lego City Comic gives us Jack Ocean, the 4th diver to appear.&nbsp; The previous ones were in issues 3, 16 and 29.&nbsp; Not only do you get the diver, but you also get a small plant section with a 1x2 gold tile.&nbsp; The comic was on sale between 9th December 2020 and 5th January 2021.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The large foil packet shows the Minifigure well as he searches for the gold on the sea bed.&nbsp; To me it appears that his torch wouldn&#39;t be shining on the gold as Jack seems too large compared to the plant life, implying it is behind him, however it shows what&#39;s in the set&nbsp;and Jack is the main element, so this is ok.</p>

<p>You can see that it contains 13 parts thanks to the yellow box in the top-right corner, 9 of which are Jack and his torch.&nbsp; It is also aimed at 5+, which as ever seems a little high for how simple this is to build.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Unlike the previous diver in Issue 29, this one compliments the 2020 City line perfectly.&nbsp; He is wearing the same suit and helmet as other 2020 sets, but his head element does not appear in any of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/year-2020/subtheme-Deep-Sea-Explorers"">five</a> Deep Sea Explorers sets or the Polybag <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30370-1/Ocean-Diver"">30370</a>.&nbsp; The head element has been used in lots of City sets before, so not unique, but it&#39;s good that this is a unique Minifigure.</p>

<p>The following parts are used for Jack:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helmet - Multicombination (mostly Bright Red) Mini Helmet No 293 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6295962/mini-helmet-no-293"">6295962</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow Mini Head No 1662 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6112620/mini-head-no-1662"">6112620</a>]</li>
	<li>Air Tank - White Mini Oxygen Bottles [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6268849/mini-oxygen-bottles"">6268849</a>]</li>
	<li>Torso - Earth Blue Mini Upper Part No 5178 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6308426/mini-upper-part-no-5178"">6308426</a>] (printed on both sides)</li>
	<li>Legs - Earth Blue (with Bright Red)&nbsp;Mini Lower Part No 1906 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6307439/mini-lower-part-no-1906"">6307439</a>]</li>
	<li>Flippers - Bright Red Frogmans Foot [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6172939/frogmans-foot"">6172939</a>]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main Build/Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set is all about the Minifigure, so the sub-build here is only 4 parts.&nbsp; The Earth Blue 3x3 seems a strange sea bed colour, but the plant element in Bright Bluish Green is very nice to have, keeping the same colour as the other City sets in the theme.&nbsp; It would have been good to have had the gold bar hidden so Jack had to find it, and the inclusion of a fish would have been appreciated.&nbsp; In similar diving sets we have had either a shark&nbsp;or a crab, making this the first without any water based animals.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I like that this fits with the 2020 City Sets, but think it needs a little bit more.&nbsp; As it is the current diver that Lego adds to sets, that is a positive, but the lack of fish stops it scoring more.</p>

<p>A small Police helicopter is in the next issue.</p>
