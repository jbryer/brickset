<p>It&#39;s not a terrible set, but curiously out of place amongst the other sets released that year. No minifig&nbsp;is included, not that they could have ridden in the helicopter anyway. But there were many other sets released that year where a minifig&nbsp;was included but they couldn&#39;t ride&nbsp;in the vehicle.</p>

<p>This set wouldn&#39;t have been out of place in the previous Legoland&nbsp;theme, in fact it looks similar to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/618-1/Police-Helicopter"">618 Police Helicopter</a>&nbsp;released the previous year. It is something of a throwback to the previous era when Lego was moving rapidly forward.</p>

"peti7788","2021-04-23T14:38:17.82Z","Promotional Heli","<p>I also don&rsquo;t understand why this set got into the town&nbsp;theme.&nbsp;I think this is also a promotional set as we don&rsquo;t get a minifigure and it wouldn&rsquo;t even fit in the helicopter.&nbsp;Which is pretty sad.&nbsp;The gaming experience is thus quite limited.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But to say<em> </em><strong>something good</strong> too, I specifically like that tail part chick is a 1 brick wide.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this set was once again released in America in the early 1980s as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6626-1/Rescue-Helicopter"" target=""_blank"">6626</a> sets.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>If this set had been released in the early 1970s, it would have fit perfectly into the Legoland theme, but is thus pretty useless without a minifigure.</p>

<h3><strong>My Mod</strong></h3>

<p>I was wondering if I could build better than this set, from the parts available in 1978, and the answer is yes.&nbsp;The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_UH-1_Iroquois"" target=""_blank"">UH 1</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Lynx"" target=""_blank"">Westland Lynx</a> helicopters were quite common at the time, so I was trying to build something like that.&nbsp;You can already put a minifigure in it, and it doesn&rsquo;t consist of many parts either.</p>

<p>I put a car door in it to have a small storage area that would fit, for example, for a 1x2 tile that symbolizes the first aid kit.</p>

<p>And I solved the engine detail with a gray cylindrical brick, which I pressed into a red 1x2 technic brick.</p>

<p>At first, I wanted to use this helicopter design idea to improve the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/575-1/Coast-Guard-Station"" target=""_blank"">575</a> set, but there I preferred to make a Sea King style helicopter.</p>
