&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this set mostly for the cool mini figures and that it included (5!!) dynamite sticks and (4!!) dollar bills which is insane for a set this size</p>

<p>the minfigures were quite good but not exclusive. This set also includes 4 bat boomerangs which I&#39;m sure Batman can&#39;t hold all at once&nbsp;</p>

<p>the rubber duck build was pretty lame and boring&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, for $15 usd you can get much better sets in other themes and figures are not exclusive anyway so you can pass this</p>

The Penguin&#39;s duck was what really drew me to it but even aside from that you get a solid basic Batman figurine and an expressive Harley with a funny expression. I did notice that Harley&#39;s hairpiece doesn&#39;t completely cover her alternate face on the back, but it&#39;s a good figure. You get quite a number of extra props, 4 batarangs, 2 money safes, and 3 extra dynamite packs which can add some props to a play scenario or give some flair to a scene.</p>

<p>Value-wise I think it&#39;s good for a simple kit, though considering you can get a Speed Champions kit for $15 which has more build time and parts you may want to see if this one goes on sale for $10 or so. If you already have these characters, there&#39;s probably not much reason to get this but it&#39;s a solid starter and I liked that it had some flair for such a miniature kit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a meh price, due to being $15 for 3 minifigures you&#39;re likely to find in other sets. However, I do give it points for giving some good versions of the characters. Meh playability as it comes from the accessories, which aren&#39;t very exciting. The building experience was lacking as the Penguin&#39;s Duck Vehicle wasn&#39;t built greatly. The parts are ok however, but could&#39;ve been better.</p>
