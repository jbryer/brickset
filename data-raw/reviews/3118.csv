"MPH","2007-09-12T06:59:51.217Z","Perfect colours","Ah, one of my all time favourites! This was probably my second lego pirate set ever, and it brings along warm feelings and fond memories. Looking back now, I think the best part of this set are its colours. The colourful baseplate and green leafs combine perfectly with the calmness of the black and grey structures. The brown elements fit in naturally and a hint of red gives the set just the extra bite it needs. All in all this makes the set very pleasing to the eye, even though the structures on the island are not very substantial as such.

With two pirates, a monkey, a parrot, a flag, a palm tree, a treasure, a brown cannon and that funny little tub this set is also full of great features. This is lego pirates at its best and Shipwreck Island deserves no less than the full 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I like the little fortress with the cannon which is very cool. The small tub is very cool and can be used as a boat which is even cooler. The monkey isn't bad either. This is probably one of the best early Pirates sets ever made.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-09-06T05:44:52.607Z","Cosy little set","I have this set twice I believe. It's very cosy, i've always had warm feelings with this set. Although it isn't very large, the atmosphere is great. It contains two animals, one regular pirate and one helmsman. The mechanism in which you put the treasure chest is very practical. It has ha nice wheeled cannon. That's a little weird since the island is very small, but then again it can come in handy in combination with other sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-31T13:53:19.21Z","Shipwreck Island Review","<p>A Classic in Pirate Legos. Shipwreck Island always struck me as an affordable and smaller scaled version of Forbidden Island. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For such an awfully small island, there's not a lot of room on it for the minifigures. I do however, applaud Lego with some of the rare and hard to come by specially printed Island Base plates for the Pirates' theme. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the build on the set that takes place on the small island portion is taken over by a large rocky outcropping, where there's a hole to stash the Pirate's chest of gold pieces, you have a Palm Tree and then a small overhang, build to cover or house the cannon in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's just not much room after that for the Two Pirate Minifigures and monkey hang around at or on. One of the pirates at least has a barrel raft to sit in and try to paddle away in. The other minifigure is going to either be in the water or standing on top of the shack for the cannon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's if you're looking at the technicalities and function of the set. It's great other wise as a way to get more pirates, monkey, palm tree, parrot, chest of gold. It could though be a small base of operations close to the Forbidden Island</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-03T03:55:15.853Z","Who Ate The Last Coconut?!","<div>Pirates was such a well rounded theme. The abundance of brown bricks and splashy water and sand bases spread with cannons and chests made a rich and highly enjoyable seascape.&nbsp;The raised bases that are often used for large buildings could have been miniaturised for these small islands but the prints inspired plenty&nbsp;of imagination driven shore and surf.</div><p><b>Minifigures:</b></p><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Brown tricorn hat.</li><li>Monkey and parrot sidekicks/mascots.</li></ul></div>The bare armed blue stripey topped pirate in blue britches and a red bandana looks suitably a right scruffpot brandishing a sword and blunderbuss pistol. The stubbly eye patched brigand has a 'gold' lined blue jerkin over red and white striped top with rather clean white britches. The crowning glory is the brown 'leather' tricorn hat. Is the&nbsp;loveable brown monkey actually a minifigure? Perhaps not but brilliant anyway with the curly tail, certainly a character.&nbsp;Now the parrot is definitely no MF but is a colourful character that brightens up trees or sits on hands in many sets.<div><br><div><b>Nuts</b></div><div>The palm trees were a new delight and fun to construct with the broad leaves and trunk sections. The monkey and parrot can usually be affixed to the tree for good effect. Unfortunately I don't recall coconut representation so these two will have to choose between a parrot cannon roast or monkey hotpot. On 'Shipwreck Island' they salvaged everything important apart from food, at least there's fish, but you'll have to build them.</div><div><br></div><div>The scallywags have constructed a simple black brick shelter that would provide some comfort but that luxury could only be deserving of their beloved cannon. The spring loaded gun sits here on the excellent brown mount and wheels with a pile of black cannon-bricks. The shelter is built around a rock with a hide hole in it that the treasure chest can be hidden in. Some camouflage or greenery is added with the odd leaf or twig bricks. They then place a brilliant printed brick, the small jolly roger flag, to ward off nosy scavengers. A fantastic half barrel with red oar returns as a makeshift boat</div><div><br></div><div><b>Ching-Chang</b></div><div>The best bit? Perhaps those wonderful shiny gold coins, making kids greedy for more treasure and loot with each set. They came in silver and gold, I think worth 5, 10 and 20? numbered on each piece.

"T79","2016-12-05T16:25:25.703Z","Pirate Cabaña vs. Cartoon Island","<p>Having built some of my old pirate sets&nbsp;(after the success of #6235 Buried Treasure) I thought it would be a neat idea to ask my boys which of these small pirate islands they preferred: #6260 Shipwreck Island or #6258 Smuggler&#39;s Shanty. Boy No.1 chooses #6260 so of course Boy No.2 decides he likes #6258 best, great. So instead I decided&nbsp;to try and give a short overview of the merits of each set&nbsp;in comparison to the other one, this would work better if there was an option to link one review to two sets though *cough*<em>feature request</em>*cough*.</p>

<h3>The good</h3>

<p>Flora and fauna present: a palm tree with some additional small leaves as camouflage, a parrot for a bit of colour&nbsp;and a monkey for some mischief.</p>

<p>A cannon which shoots black round 1 x 1 bricks. Most cannons on land were mounted on a big turntable at the time so it&#39;s nice to have a cannon on wheels for a change, the brown wheels without tyres&nbsp;look good and make it look like it was salvaged from a shipwreck (just how these two pirates were able to bring it ashore is, perhaps wisely, left unanswered).</p>

<p>The half barrel as makeshift boat was a favourite&nbsp;when I was a kid.</p>

<p>The standard &#39;full&#39; treasure chest with two coin sprues.</p>

<p>The 16 x 16 baseplate with island print!</p>

<h3>The &#39;could be improved&#39;</h3>

<p>In comparison to #6258, the lack of a shark and/or opposing soldiers. Even at the time I would have loved for a shark to be included here, if this is your only pirate set your options are limited.</p>

<p>Even though there&#39;s hardly anything on the island it still feels cramped: with the small shelter for the cannon, the palm tree and the small rock-with-hole to hide the treasure there&#39;s hardly any room left for the pirates to stand. Set #6265 Sabre Island uses the same baseplate&nbsp;but makes it appear bigger than it really is while this set here has the opposite effect. In fact, I always get that &#39;cartoony deserted island with one palm tree as only feature&#39; feeling with this set, a feeling I definitely do not get with #6265.</p>

<p>No shack for the pirates, they&#39;ll have to make their camp under said palm tree?</p>

<p>A bit short on equipment: one sabre and one pistol for two pirates, even the humble #6235 managed more but this can be excused as the presence of the cannon makes up for that.</p>

<h3>In short</h3>

<p>Still my favourite of the two but that could be nostalgia speaking (this one was mine, the other one was not). On its own this might be&nbsp;weaker than #6258 but it makes up for this with some better parts to add to your pirate collection. Actually having both of them they form an ideal partnership with this set providing the island, tree and cannon while the other set provides the shark, shack, soldier and rowboat. And you can always add one or two of the pirates to the redcoat rowboat as &#39;impressed&#39; sailors to even the odds...</p>
