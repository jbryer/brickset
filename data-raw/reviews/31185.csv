<p>This is a great value and has a nice variety of accessories.&nbsp; I only bought one from the Lego store because it was the last one they had, otherwise I would have bought two or three to have a buffet.</p>

<p>Rating note: I rated the building experience as a 1 because there&#39;s no almost no building involved unless you count putting hotdogs in buns or connecting the ketchup, mustard and stove pieces together.&nbsp; My rating isn&#39;t a demerit to the set, it&#39;s just not applicable.&nbsp; The same is true for my playability rating since no child will play with a single Lego pretzel or banana for 30 minutes.&nbsp; However, playability got a score since they enhance the play of Lego minifigures with the food pieces.</p>
