"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-18T16:35:33Z","Raft Raiders review","Definately the nicest of the small rafts that Lego created, this raft has the look of being created from the remains of a shipwreck.  It comes with six barrels (almost makes you want to buy two for the barrels alone!) along with rigging and a really nice sail.  The actual raft itself has two levels including an upper deck where the pirates use the tiller to steer the ship.  It has hooks for cutlasses and pistols, and a treasure chest to boot.  The only thing keeping this set from a perfect 10 is the figures.  Nothing new here, just the same old figures everyone has a million of.  (At least they didn't give me another green and gold Captain Redbeard!) ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-28T16:22:27Z","really cool, yo.","before i bought this set, i thought that it was a piece of junk. i thought &quot;there's no way that any pirate would have a raft with rigging, much less a sail. i eventually decided to buy it just because i felt like it. i was shocked by it's awesomeness. it is soooo cooool. the mast, rigging, sail and rudder are &quot;totally kewl beans!!! it has 3 figures. Ironhook is always welcome, and the other two, while common, are still nice to have. to make Ironhook look better, take the tricorne hatted fellow's leg and pegleg and swap them with Ironhook's legs. it also has a treasure chest, weapons, and a little plank above the deck for putting stuff like maps for examination or coins or food\drink (only coins are included). it has 6 barrels, which is nice, but they can't be used other than for this set (unless you want a sinking raft). however, this leads to the problem. the raft looks &quot;too big for its britches&quot;. the base of the raft is narrower than the deck, making the think look a bit clumsy.
but this set still rocks. get it if possible. yo.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-26T13:58:12.123Z","A fine vessel, this.","This is by far the best-designed of the pirate raft sets.  With its rigging, barrels and its great-looking cloth flag it has a distinctive style to it.  There's also a treasure chest and three minifigs, as well as a shark to add to their shipwrecked worries.  A great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-24T12:40:37.39Z","Raft Raiders","This set is from the pirates theme and was released in the year of 1992. Like some other from this theme, this have much useful pieces and a awesome design. The three minifigures included are three simple but also nice designed minifigures, with some characteristics of this theme, like the wood leg, hook and hat. This set also includes a treasure in a chest. The building of the raft is not much hard but is not easy like others, is a cool building, that makes as result a playable and good designed raft, but in a classic Lego pirates theme style. There is also a flag and some minifigures can stay good on it. The playability is basic and when you are playing with it, it don't unbuild. All the pieces are useful and also in a nice color scheme, and during the building all the features like the flag and tower works very well. Overall this set is awesome and also playable. Altough this set have pieces of a old style, this is cool, and so, i rate the &quot;Raft Raiders&quot;, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-30T12:31:39.653Z","Lego as it was originally intended.","I purchased this set off of bricklink several days ago and I recieved it yesterday. (I saved on shipping/handling because the seller's house was a 5 minute drive away!) I was starting to lose patience when we FINALLY found time to pick it up, and I am NOT disappointed! This set showed me what Lego was back in the early '90s. It was smaller than I expected but the build was still fun.

Pros:
three figs
raft is pretty neat
SHARKIE!
good assortment of weapons
TREASURE!
quite a few barrels (those are always good to have)
some neat pieces (cutlass, flintlocks, flag, sail
printed on sail and flag!

Cons:
raft is a little small ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I agree that this raft gives a definite feel that their ship has crashed, and they have assembeled a get away raft from salvaged ship parts. The set has a good variety of pirates, and is probably one of the best sets of it's size. As always, I include a figuire review:

It looks like the remains of a larger ship that has broken up during a storm or a battle with the soldiers' or a skirmish with some Treasure Islanders. Nice addition!

"AETerry","2011-01-17T13:54:01.997Z","Raft Raiders Review","<p>Of all of the Pirate Rafts I own and have seen, I think this raft set and build is one of the best in the Pirate theme. The raft itself is well built with a sail and rigging that truely suggests it being built from the wreckage of a larger ship. Barrels to help it float. It really does look good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's three minifigures and a shark. Two of the minifigures are different enough in design from older Pirate Minifigures to make the set interesting. A chest of gold with 4 pirate gold coins. Which seems a standard feature in many pirate sets.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"James83","2021-07-26T16:47:58.23Z","Captain Ironhook's ","<p>In 1992 the Pirate range got a new baddie, Captain Redbeard hung up his cutlass and instead Captain Ironhook arrived to battle the new red-coated Imperial soldiers. He arrived on a raft crafted from the remains of a shipwreck and an impressive raft it was too!</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This set has 81 parts which gives some indication of how involved building this raft is. Unlike previous raft sets, this one has a unique set of features and includes some Technic elements within its construction. The base is very solid and holds six barrels which provide the &#39;floatation&#39; for this craft, this feature makes it stand out from the older raft sets. The main structure consists of two levels, the main lower deck with inverted slope bricks at the side, perhaps representing a bit of shipwrecked boat, and a gangplank higher up onto which the mast is attached. The mast has rigging to either side which is attached to the raft with vertical clip bricks. A crossbar and a piece&nbsp;of string attach the white printed skull and crossbones sail to the mast, the sail was unique to this set.&nbsp;The&nbsp;mast and rigging is very sturdy to withstand rough handling and its easy enough to place the figures around the raft without anything getting in the way. A simple hinge for the paddle used as a rudder is formed from using a 1x2 side handle brick and a clip brick which proves very sturdy. The two 1x2 side handle bricks at the front of the raft finish the design off nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The craft has a couple of clips for hand-held objects such as cutlasses and comes with a treasure chest with four gold coins. The build is involved but not too complicated and it&#39;s rewarding to see it take shape as you build.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with three minifigs. Captain Ironhook features&nbsp;a hooked hand, black trousers, tattered red vest torso with knife, a Captain Redbeard head and a pirate captain hat. Pirate number two has&nbsp;grey trousers, blue striped vest torso with belt, a head with a moustache and stubble and a red bandanna. The third pirate has one wooden&nbsp;leg, red striped vest torso with belt, a head with a moustache and stubble and a black felt hat.</p>

<p>They are well armed with two flintlock pistols and three cutlasses.</p>

<p>A Shark is also provided. Given how common these were in Pirate sets, perhaps it wasn&#39;t needed but does provide extra playability if you wanted to just play with this set on its own.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This tough raft took a lot of punishment on the rough carpet seas of the living room floor. It&#39;s a nice craft for playing out a scene, lots of deck space plus rigging to hang figures off as they battle Imperial soldiers with one hand as the climb up. Plus it had treasure (who can say they ever had too many coins?), Captain Ironheart could easily steal three chests of loot and place them aboard his raft. If you wanted a badass Pirate vessel and couldn&#39;t afford one of the big sailing ships, this was the next best thing.&nbsp;</p>

"Chrinchy","2020-06-19T20:56:25.87Z","A hidden gem!","<p>An excellent little pirate set that is unique but has a lot of good quality to it. It really feels like something that was made with pieces of a much larger ship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>The building experience was fun and simple. I enjoy the way the mast is put on, how the barrels are used and how the raft has 2 levels to it for some added depth and realism. Nothing in the instructions was difficult or confusing and seeing the raft being built from the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; up was cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>The parts themselves were simple, nothing unique or special. The sail is made of cloth, you get some string and then the lego pieces have been used in many other sets.</p>

<p>Having 3 figures and a shark is really cool and makes the value f this set that much more. There are plenty of weapons for the 3 of them, plus some treasure&nbsp;and a chest to protect or hide if they so choose.</p>

<p>My only complaint which I think is very small and only in my opinion is that the rudder they use is red. I feel that using that colour doesn&#39;t really work with the pirate theme and feels out of place. A brown, black or grey rudder would have been better but like I said that is my only opinion and a small complaint at that.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>You can have lots of fun playing with this set, it offers some good playtime and even if you have it on display you can easily adjust the pirate figures positions to change it up for fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for your money:</p>

<p>At the time it was great value for your money. Can&#39;t afford a big pirate ship but want something close to it? This fits in perfectly to the pirate line of the time...not too small but not too big either and it still feels like you have a &ldquo;ship&rdquo; of sorts.</p>
