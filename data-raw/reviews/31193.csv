Overall I&#39;m happy with my purchase; however, there are too few bricks of each colour to make it a particularly useful set. I would rather that Lego would release three 1200-piece sets with, say, 300 pieces in&nbsp;4 colours than one set containing&nbsp;what appears to be 100 or so in a dozen colours.&nbsp;</p>
