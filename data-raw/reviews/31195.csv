Some of my first Lego sets were the earliest minifig sets like #608 Taxi. &nbsp;Although they came with these new fangled figure things (they&#39;ll never catch on) you couldn&#39;t actually put them (or anyone else) inside tiny little cars. &nbsp;Never mind! &nbsp;It&#39;s all about the town-scape, the hustle and bustle, the layout.</p>

<p>Some 40 years on, its still quite reassuring to find Lego sets like this - reasonably priced, with a classic parts set, and a sensible build.</p>

<p>Yet, here&#39;s the problem I have with it. &nbsp;It seems at first&nbsp;City scaled, 6-stud wide and would look just great in the town. &nbsp;But the scale then only seems right&nbsp;width and length wise - height wise it&#39;s perhaps a bit squat. Or is it? &nbsp;Have we just become so minifig-scale tuned, that we expect cars to be a great deal taller than they actually ought to be? &nbsp;It&#39;s well known that minifigs are a <i>really</i> odd scale - almost nothing about their arm, leg, torso or hips is anatomically even remotely correct - and so Lego scale is usually completely odd as a result. &nbsp;So this, is a 6-stud wide, city sized car into which you can fit precisely zero minifigs. &nbsp;And none are supplied.</p>

<p>The #40469 TukTuk (which I bought at the same time) is minifig scaled (though doesn&#39;t come with any either) but is probably a damn sight taller than it really ought to be.</p>

<p>So what do I love&nbsp;about it if it&#39;s a weird size, there are no figures and you couldn&#39;t put any inside anyway? &nbsp;It&#39;s because it&#39;s a reassuringly classic Lego car, built with (mainly)&nbsp;classic pieces,&nbsp;it looks great and it&#39;s very affordable. &nbsp;Buy it for the pieces and you&#39;ll get loads of jumper plates, a selection of transparent 45&deg; roof bricks (which were very prevalent in sets of the late 70s so I have a great soft spot for them), and some very useful stickers for MOCing.</p>

<p>So yes - it&#39;s <i>still</i> all about the city, the hustle and bustle, and the layout. &nbsp;It&#39;ll look fine in a City - it&#39;ll be a good addition to your parts inventory.&nbsp;Never mind you can&#39;t get a minifig in it. &nbsp;Lego remains the best toy in the world. &nbsp;Even if the minifig scale is bonkers.</p>
