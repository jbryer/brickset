<p>The new Lego Creator Tuk-Tuk is a beautiful set with a even better price. I could easily see Lego making this 15 or even 20 dollars, but 10 dollars for this is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>

<p>In terms of pieces, there really isn&#39;t anything special. There are some nice colors and the little dangly bits on the roof are nice, but otherwise the parts are mediocre at best.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are surprisingly long, but not complex. The booklet does have some weight, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>The finished model is surprisingly big, but still works in a modular city. It fits at least 2 minifigures, one driver and one passenger. My only problem with the set is the lack of minifigures. As an Indian, I would have really liked some Indian-inspired minifigures, but even generic ones would be fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a easy buy and I would definitely recommend it. It works great with the older speed champions and even Lego City cars, so it won&#39;t look out of place in a Lego City(at least a modular city). Hopefully, Lego makes more of these cheap vehicles, especially as Speed Champion sets increase in value over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My wife saw this and fell in love with it, next thing,&nbsp;one had landed on the doorstep and was ready to build.</p>

<p>At only &pound;8.99, it&#39;s a steal, doesn&#39;t&nbsp;take long to build, has some great techniques for attaching parts and the colours and great.</p>

<p>The only criticism I have,&nbsp;is that it&#39;s not the right size for mini figs, just a touch too big. &nbsp;But not that bad, as I got another one.</p>

<p>It makes it more interesting,&nbsp;with the different design and colours, of the more traditional cars and trucks.</p>

<p>More designs from different cultures.</p>
