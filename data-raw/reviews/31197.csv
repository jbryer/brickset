<p>Hello Everyone,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am really thrilled to talk to you about this little set of&nbsp; &quot;fleurs&quot; (flowers in French). Those Roses are the most adorable AND affordable Lego you could offer to someone you love and you cherish. In that way, some people can discover or rediscover the love for our Lego !&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those Roses are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>affordable,</li>
	<li>adorable,</li>
	<li>really easy to build,</li>
	<li>really quick to make,</li>
	<li>the plan is easy to understand,</li>
	<li>they are no minifigs,</li>
	<li>the parts are simple</li>
	<li>and the end is really beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those Roses are really magnificent pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, I paired it with the set the Flower Bouquet (10280) and it makes a hell of a good bouquet ! You don&#39;t have to water it, and you can pair it with a lego vase that you will build yourself, or you can put it in a real vase. I take the real vase. For decoration, this a must-have.</p>

<p>Have Fun,</p>

<p>Xena&#39;s out !&nbsp;</p>

La costruzione &egrave; molto breve perch&eacute; ha pochi pezzi, tuttavia avrei preferito avere dei pezzi da 2 piatti che facessero diventare liscia la base dei petali. In ogni caso, consigliato</p>
