"legolander","2007-05-02T23:57:31.56Z","My First Legendary Lego Set...","If I could remember it right, this was my very first LEGO Legends (Pirates/Islanders) set. I still have most of the pieces as well as the minifigs, but I don't have the instructions anymore. I also lost the drum accessory and the sail cloth for the pirates' boat. How I wish I still have everything that's included in my Pirates Sets (All Pirate sets that I have are already incomplete and I think I'll have a hard time rebuilding them in case I get in the mood of doing it!). This is a nice set, actually. I hope they'll re-release this set as well as the other Islanders/Pirates sets, only this time with flesh skin color. I know I'm demanding too much, but hey, what's the use of this site if not for comments, reviews, and suggestions? Well, anyway this will do for now. Four stars for this set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-10-13T20:17:20.903Z","Pirates ye be warned","I got this off of bricklink today. This is my biggest Pirates set so far. (Until next year, heh heh heh. ;)) This set comes with two Pirates, three Islanders, a rowboat, King Kahuka&quot;s carrier, a croc, and accessories. This set has a lot of neat play options and works really well with other sets. (cough* Raft Raiders *cough)

Pros:

King Kahuka
never had a rowboat before
CROCODILE!
five figs
treasure

Cons:
You know what? I'm not even gonna bother here.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:43:42.467Z","Lovely model","This is the set that makes 6236 actually redundant. It is compact yet amazingly detailed with the head. Don't you just love the grey stoned head, also used in other sets like 6278 Enchanted Island? I once modified this set by putting LED's (small low-current low-voltage lights) in the eyes, so the eyes glowed red. This simulated the firing spirit of the rich islanders. The 5 figures and the lovely bearing plank for Kahuka and the sailed brown pirates boat completes this set, as does the semi-hidden treasure.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2012-01-26T12:13:26.97Z","Islanders and Their King","<p>Set #6262 King Kahuka's Throne: This is one of the largest Islander Sets that LEGO made available, in todays' market it would roughly be the equivalent of Loot Island from the 2009 Pirates Theme sets. I say roughly because I believe it has more pieces than that set, but I'm not 100% sure on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary selling point of this set, the model, features a great looking Tiki headed alcove where the Islanders store their valuables, it features two Islander Shields and an altar where the Islanders apparently worship their gold. It also has a nice looking drum, and a gurney to carry King Kahuka around. It was a simple, but fun build and featured an interesting set piece for the Islanders and Pirates Mini-Figs to do battle with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd say the Mini-Figs are a good reason for getting this set in todays market. You get two Islanders, King Kahuka, two Pirates and as a bonus one of LEGOs special Crocodile piece. There were a few decent accessories too, nothing unique aside from the Islander print shields, but familiar and fun enough to enjoy mock battling between the Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this, along with the Crocodile Cage and King Kahuka sets I've recently reviewed would make an excellent little Islanders display, with the altar and the throne from King Kahuka's set being swapped around on the baseplate you could make a really killer looking little Islanders worshiping area. Also the longboat in this set features a nifty sail assembly.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-04T21:49:50.953Z","The big Kahuka.","<div>If I could shake the hand of the genius who decided that the Islanders were to be a subtheme of the popular Pirates theme, I certainly would. Having been around for a good five years, the Pirates theme was, apparently, looking for an injection of creativity to liven up the age-old conflict between pirates and soldiers, and nothing, I think, could have been more awesome than the inclusion of the Islanders as a mysterious third party.</div><div><br></div><div>It's never made entirely clear if the Islanders are meant to represent any one culture in particular, but judging from the names (""Kahuka"") and the moai-like iconography, I think we can glean that they are meant to be a mishmash of various Polynesian cultures spread out across the South Pacific. I don't think historical and/or anthropological accuracy is necessarily what LEGO had in mind when they were designing the Islanders, but the look and feel of the theme (and this set) certainly works well. It's colourful, it's fresh, and it puts a new spin on the entire dynamic of the Pirates theme.</div><div><br></div><div>King Kahuka's Throne is extremely generous with the Minifigs: five of them in a set of less than 150 pieces, which is pretty darn nice, to say nothing of the varied selection of Minifigs that make up this little troupe. The two pirates share a same face, but they have sufficiently different get-ups that they are safely distinguished from each other. The Three Islanders, though, constitute the main event here: two of them are ""generic"" Islander people (Maori?), and they cart around the titular King Kahuka with his impressive red mask. With their painted faces and detailed printing, the Islanders are all cool Minifigs, and they remain highly unique and desirable even today; while the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean </i>cannibals from The Cannibal Escape (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4182-1"">4182</a>) share some passing similarities, I don't think they're nearly as awesome as the Islanders. Oh yes, and there's also a crocodile, I guess.</div><div><br></div><div>The set has two small builds and one not-so-small build, which is the throne itself. The little pirate raft is nothing terribly special, though it's always nice to have another sea-worthy (i.e. floating) vessel, since it's easily used and re-used for any number of purposes. The other small build is the sedan chair thing upon which sits King Kahuka; I am not qualified to state as to whether or not Polynesian chiefs ever went around on chairs like that, but I am qualified to say that the throne ""room"" features a simple spot for the chair to be rested, which is cool.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Which brings us to the centrepiece - the throne itself and its surrounding environs. It's a very simple design and the square baseplate is far from necessary, but it's charming enough and conveys the right amount of Islander iconography to give the set a very special feel. It's essentially a BURP decorated by a moai-looking head and a couple of leaves and odds and ends, but it just works - it's naturalistic and understated, which is exactly what one would expect from an island people.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Islanders are a great theme overall, and this is just one more great set from an outstanding theme. If ever a subtheme needed to make a reappearance, I would aim my finger firmly towards this one. I love this set - wish I still had it!!</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"markwashington","2016-12-29T23:46:04.487Z","A face only a mother (or Islander King) could love.","<p>King Kahuka&#39;s Throne (Indigo Throne Cave in the UK) is one of the larger Islander sets Lego released in 1994. The UK catalogue has this to say about the set: &quot;Can the pirates steal the treasure or will they be scared away by the mysterious stone statue?&quot;</p>

<p>The Islanders theme had some lovely looking sets and for me this is one of the best. It comes with five figures which is an excellent return for a set of this size, including two of the generic islanders (my favourite islander figures) the King and two pirates (no captain sadly). The pirates come in a little boat which has a great black and white sail. This is the first time the little black and white sail is used, as the previous small red and white sail used in 6277 and 6267 would have clashed with the sails used on 6286. A nice touch by Lego and certainly welcome as I love the cloth sails.</p>

<p>The main bulk of the set is made up of the cave/throne room for the King. A BURP (big ugly rock piece) is used for the cave but for once doesn&#39;t really detract from the looks of the set as it isn&#39;t that noticeable. King Kahuka sits on some sort of chair situation which can be either sat on a base or carried by his poor minions. There is space in the cave to hide a treasure chest and a little fire just outside. The best part of the set is the stone head on top of the cave. I guess Lego were going for an Easter Island sort of vibe and they&#39;ve nailed it in my opinion. Its a really simple build but such an effective use of the bricks.</p>

<p>This is my second favourite Islander set and well worth a purchase. Its still at a pretty good level price wise and for what you get its a must have in your pirate collection.</p>

"DrBrickZi","2020-04-28T07:43:08.353Z","Kahuka is the KING!","<p>I had this set since I was a kid!</p>

<p>I&nbsp;loved pirate theme in lego but always felt they had no challengers, until this islander/tribe theme came along. It is a great set to play&nbsp;with pirates!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong> are great! I really love&nbsp;<strong>King Kahuka</strong> with his impressive mask! The 2 <strong>islanders</strong> are also great to support this king. <strong>Pirates</strong> are similar to other previous pirates sets, nothing special, but no harm getting more pirates to add to your pirate ship=)</p>

<p><strong>Crocodile</strong> is a great add to this set. The pirates&#39; enemy,&nbsp;and I also see it as a guardian for the islanders.</p>

<p><strong>Throne </strong>hiding treasure chest! The build is simple yet naturalistic, depicting islander landscape. Would be great to have a unique islander treasure chest, rather than reusing pirate theme treasure chest.</p>

<p><strong>The little details</strong>: I like the islander&#39;s shield as well. Unique with a tribal face mask. The drum, table and fire adds on great details to this set, bringing out the earliest human interaction with nature. I think would be great to have some added tree/shurbs to this set.</p>

<p>I also like that the back of the box provides other inspiration to build this set, but a pity that it does not have instructions for those builds. Imagination required here =)</p>

<p><strong>Overall: </strong>I like this set since I was a kid. would love to see more islander/tribal theme sets.</p>

<p>I have taken more pictures of this vintage set in details in my blog.</p>
