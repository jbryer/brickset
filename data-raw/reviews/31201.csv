The huge fins, abundance of chrome and large engines defined a majority of vehicles that came out of Detroit. Such cars represent a significant portion of automotive history, and I am glad for their existence. However, American cars from that era are not very common in my country. Lego&#39;s &#39;Vintage Car&#39; set number 40448, while not really meant to represent any particular car, embodies all those features which made American cars of the 50s memorable and satisfied my hankering to own a piece of vintage Americana; at least in minifig scale.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A significant point worth noting is that this set was given free and contains 189 pieces. It comes with two minifigs and an instruction booklet. There is a sticker sheet for the number plate. Others may have already pointed out that the number plate is AM0937, with 0937 actually reading &#39;LEGO&#39; if flipped vertically.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The minifigs are once again clothed to capture the era. The male minifig wears a &#39;50s style varsity letter jacket while the female seems to be wearing a black leather jacket with light purple leggings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The car&#39;s colour palette is pastel with bright bluish green for most of the bodywork with white detailing at the doors and fins. The windscreen is a 4-stud wide transparent light blue piece and mounted uniquely which requires swivelling it into place. The interior is a light brownish colour and includes a standard steering wheel. The colours are period correct and shows that thought went into selecting them. The trim pieces around the front grille, headlight and bumper are shown in chrome in the designers&#39; original creation. These have been altered to plastic grey and slightly lessen the visual impact. The silver metallic hood ornament is once again, nice attention to detail and brings to mind cars such as the Plymouth Belvedere, Chevy Bel Air and Ford Fairlane.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If anything can be improved in this set, it&#39;s the windscreen. The 4-stud wide piece interferes with the minifigs legs when seated in the car. A 6-stud wide windscreen can be used at the expense of removing the wing mirrors. Also, whitewall tires would have been a nice touch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, Lego&#39;s &#39;Vintage Car&#39; set number 40448 is a delightful set to build that captures the sense of freedom and fun as we reminisce a bygone era especially during the current global situation.</p>
