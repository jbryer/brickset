<br />
This issue is called &ldquo;Incredible Plants&rdquo; and has a lot of helpful tips on making trees, flowers and other foliage, and some very interesting information about a variety of weird and wonderful plants from around the world. This is where my degree in environmental science comes in handy &mdash; but there are a couple of plants featured that I hadn&#39;t even heard of!&nbsp;It&#39;s just the sort of thing to get a budding young biologist, ecologist or botanist invested.<br />
<br />
The build itself is fairly simple but with a couple of interesting twists, like having upside down construction in the lower jaw, barbs attached via hollow studs to the underside of plates (both in the regular positions and into the tubes) and a clever use of taps to attach the eyes. The build is solidly locked together so that wiggling the arms and moving the jaws doesn&#39;t cause it to come apart. Even the eyes can move in two directions each!<br />
The use of multiple different colours of plates is probably to make them easier to identify when building, but it does make the back of the model look untidy.<br />
<br />
I can agree with designer Nina Koopman&#39;s decision to make a more expressive plant. I think a regular tree or flower model wouldn&#39;t sell as well, and given the magazine is &pound;1 more than other Lego magazines it&#39;s sold with that&#39;s an important thing to consider. However, given the magazine&#39;s focus on real life plants, I&#39;m a little saddened that this one isn&#39;t based on a real species. It&#39;s more like Audrey from Little Shop of Horrors, which may get parents&#39; attention but may be lost on a lot of the kids it&#39;s purchased for.<br />
<br />
I would have liked to see taps in a colour other than light bluish grey, and the fact there are only two foliage pieces in the set is disappointing. The parts are fairly standard, but I hadn&#39;t had any of the clip and bar parts used to attach the mouth in those colours before, and the red plates used for the mouth haven&#39;t been commonly available since the early 00s.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#39;s a decent parts pack, a cute model, and the magazine it comes with is an absolute treasure trove of information both on building techniques and botany. Build-wise it isn&#39;t amazing, but there are some good techniques on show, all with the aim of getting kids to expand their view of what&#39;s possible with Lego.</p>
