You can also build King Kahuka with this set if tou take the red mask on the top of the building and take the figure with blue and white face paint.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I'll probably enjoy reconstructing this along with my other pirate collections. The neat thing in this set is the cave which opens when you move the side of the stone-faced figure. Really good actually. Four out of five stars! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I once connected this to a Lego Technic set, the effect was great! What I especially like is the fact that one of the islanders has another painted face. Look at the picture: the one in the cano. What I also find funny is the fact that one of the pirates wears grean trousers, that was revolutionary for my lego set in those days.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2016-01-24T16:54:24.523Z","Forbidden Cove; the Islanders hide-out","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong> : A great medium sized Pirates set of the Islanders subtheme. I love these sets because&nbsp;they are a bit more colorful than the regular Pirates set and of course the Islander mini figures. Sets like this can still easy be combined with modern day Pirates sets. A weak point (like in various Pirate sets) are the palm tree leaves Especially the big ones tend to break quickly, I miss several too but there are still plenty to find on Bricklink. Overall a very nice and affordable set and not&nbsp;very hard to find.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong> : Not a real challenge to built this set, the &quot;hardest&quot; part is the great looking statue that functions as a secret entrance. Missing maybe&nbsp;is something like a surprise trap when you open it. The rest is straight building without surprises, so 3 bricks is sufficient here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong> : No spectacular parts but the sum of it allows me to give 4 bricks. We get 4 good mini figures with two boats and sufficient weapons. Nice accessories like the parrot and the crocodile. Overall very useful parts for possible MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Playability&nbsp;5 bricks</strong> : It is simple : a great looking set with 2 opposite parties and a hidden door offers maximum playability, nothing to add here.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong> :&nbsp;A 200 part set (used of course) with 4 mini figures for some &euro; 25,00 is a good deal I guess. Be sure you get it with the right leaves. A 2016 set with the same content would definitely be more expensive.&nbsp;Surely a&nbsp;recommendation for everyone&#39;s collection.</p>

"Cult_Of_Skaro","2012-02-26T19:29:15.74Z","6264 Forbidden Cove","<p>I got this set from my uncle after he stopped caring about LEGO. It's a lovely set with a nice fantasy design, though I guess I'm a bit biased, being a great lover of this genre. The best part for me is the awesome idol thingy, LEGO really was good at brick-built faces in the nineties.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Great. While I love LEGO's current CG art, I wish they would do it like this at least occasionally. It always looks nice to see the set on a diorama, instead of a CG set on a CG background. 5/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Most of the parts aren't that exciting, but I love the moose mask and the canoe. 4/5</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Awesome. The Islander chief guy is exclusive to the set, and would be awesome even if he wasn't. I have always been a sucker for that tribal face paint. Not to mention the pirates, who, at least when I play with the set, are human sacrifices. Yeah, I know, sick. 4/5</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not much. There is, however, one really good part. The statue. How designers do it I don't know, but it looks exactly what you'd expect a pagan idol to look like. For this reason, I give the build 3.5/5.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The build, though uneventful, gives a really nice look. The playability's good, with a passage through the stone, which can be used for pagan rituals. Tasty pirates. Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If it's not too expensive, I would buy this set. It can really brighten up the place, and pirates only improve with age. (Yum) I hope you enjoyed this review.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"James83","2021-08-18T14:58:25.85Z","What's Behind the Face?","<p>This was one of the larger Islanders sets and having already acquired 6256, I wanted this to build up my Islanders collection. Beyond Enchanted Island 6278 it was the only other Islanders building set. Also,&nbsp;not many sets of that era had cool features like a secret cave hidden by a sculpted face.</p>

<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>

<p>The set sits upon a 16x32 blue baseplate, yellow bricks being used to build up a sandy beach on either side of the cave. The beach features a drum (with printed hide brick) and a palm tree. The heart of this set is, ironically, its cavity in the centre;&nbsp;a secret place where treasures or a canoe crammed with fearsome Islander warriors could be kept hidden and safe. The cave itself is easy to build, it consists of two large mountain bricks with some grey elements to form the mouth of the cave. Two large arches, one grey and one black, form the floor of the observation post above. The inside of the cave is bare except for two 2x4 red bricks which serve as storage space for a couple of treasure chests&nbsp;At least one other reviewer points out the cave itself is rather shallow, certainly it won&#39;t hold the canoe without it poking out the back. It&#39;s a valid point, but then a lot of 1980s and 1990s sets were quite shallow, most not being much more than 8-12 studs deep on average. The entrance is also quite narrow, the canoe fits easily, but larger boats will not.</p>

<p>The main visual feature of course is the sculptured face which hides the entrance to the cave. Just using black and grey bricks (grey bricks were rare in this period) it builds up a slightly menacing face with a mouth, eyes and nose and adorned by horns, feathers and two palm leaves. It swings open by hand with the aid of a single Technic plug, it usually stays open without difficulty, though the palm leaves tend to get in the way in my experience. Its perhaps notable that the instructions have as many steps for making the face as it does for assembling the rest of the structure!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The observation post is nicely finished with red and black bricks, is easily accessible by hand to place figures inside and the palm leaf roof is a very neat touch and is very sturdy. A pole on the roof has a figurehead with a black head brick on which is a Chief&#39;s mask with horns. The upper floor is reached by two ladders which lead to narrow platforms, a very generous amount given that quite a few Pirate sets from 1991-93 lacked any means to reach their upper floors! Two vines also provide an easy means for the Islander guards to slide down to the beach and are a neat touch. The set comes with a treasure chest and eight gold coins.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>One Islanders canoe with decal markings and one standard wooden boat with a Jolly Roger flag at the stern and associated oars, little assembly of either is needed. But having both enables you to stage a water fight, or a slow-motion car chase type scene.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Two Islanders: one with identical legs and torso as Chief Kahuka in 6256 with a head featuring face paint (white square with blue edges and red stripes), with Islander hair with feathers&nbsp;and the other figure has a more ornate torso with feather patterns and&nbsp;white and red face paint on the face brick. The hair is adorned with horns and he carries a pack of quivers. They come armed with a spear and a bow and have two shields (printed with Islanders art).</p>

<p>Two Pirates: the first has a wooden leg, tattered red vest torso with knife detailing (first seen as Captain Ironhook in set 6261of 1992), red bearded head with eyepatch and a Pirate Captain&#39;s hat. The second pirate has green legs (which is unusual), a striped red and black vest torso, head with stubble and eyepatch and a blue bandanna. They come armed with a cutlass and a flintlock rifle.</p>

<p>Also included is the obligatory parrot and crocodile.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>As a set this looks good and is the perfect place to stage a Pirate raid, it offers quite a few levels for staging fights (the beach, cliff faces, the vines, the upper floor) and with two boats offers lots of potential for chase scenes. With just two Islanders however it feels a little undermanned for guards and if two are in the canoe who is guarding the cave? There probably little justification for Lego to include a fifth minifig, the set probably isn&#39;t large enough to justify that, so you will have to rely on other Islander sets (of which there were not many) in your collection for more manpower. It is a good-looking set, few mid-size Pirate sets ever looked this good. I never did too much to this set, it&#39;s not well suited to add-ons, but it was a fun set to play with on its own. I must admit eventually I broke it down to harvest the rarer grey sloped brick and arch bricks for other building projects. Looking back it is a shame Lego did not extend the Islanders range further, only six sets made them a relatively short-lived feature in the Pirate theme, especially given the effort Lego put in to making the bespoke printed items such as shields and bricks like the masks, feathers and horns.</p>

"markwashington","2018-04-28T16:49:23.357Z","Why the long face?","<p>Forbidden cove (or Indigo treasure cave) was the second largest&nbsp;set in the Islanders theme released in 1994. The UK catalogue&nbsp;had this to say about the set: &quot;Ironhook searches for the secret cave entrance past the crocodile and the guards.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start by addressing what I like about his set as in all honesty it isn&#39;t my favourite of the Islander&#39;s offerings. I love the stone head that&#39;s built into the cave &quot;door&quot;, it&#39;s a really interesting design and the face has a lovely melancholic look about it. Obviously the face is the first thing you look at when you see the set, and in that way Lego have succeeded in drawing your focus away from the set&#39;s flaws.</p>

<p>Its an easy build, which is classic 1990&#39;s Lego although they do make very good use of what is a fairly low piece count. I like sets to be built onto a baseboard and a blue 32x16 is a nice start. The sides of the cave are basically two of the smaller BURPs&nbsp;with a few bricks built onto them. and inside the cave is an area for the ever popular treasure set to hide. One of my main issues with the cave is that it doesn&#39;t have enough depth to hide either the canoe or pirate&#39;s boat, they either poke out of the back or you can&#39;t swing the entrance round, all very annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of figures you get Ironhook&nbsp;(the pirate captain) a generic pirate figure, albeit with green legs which I remember being a bit of a novelty at the time, a Islander warrior and finally another King Kahuka.&nbsp;In this set his mask sits on top of a totem pole but its still the same fig. Considering 6262 comes with 5 figs this is a bit of a shame. An extra Islander would definitely make the set feel&nbsp;more complete.</p>

<p>Its hard for me to explain how I feel about this set as I love the Islanders theme but this set just feels like a wasted opportunity, imagine if Lego had gone all out and made this set like 6279, now that would have been a real killer. As it is I see this set as one of the less important Islanders offerings. A must for any completist but avoidable if you&#39;re only seeking out the more iconic pirate sets.</p>
