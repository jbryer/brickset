Milne books, and I saw the original DIsney cartoon when it first arrived in theaters. Winnie and Piglet were among my most cherished stuffed animals, sleeping with me every night.</p>

<p>Well over 50 years have passed since then, and I was looking forward to recapturing some of the happy magic of my childhood with the new LEGO Winnie the Pooh set. Instead, I found just about every aspect of the set disappointing.</p>

<p>I find that the best LEGO sets provide delight throughout the build experience; and furthermore that they provide different kinds of delight depending on what is being built. The new Heartlake City Shopping Mall&nbsp;offers childlike charm and wonder; an epic Technic build like the Lamborghini makes you feel like an engineer; Ninjago City Docks was filled with surprise after surprise from both the innovative building techniques and the Easter Egg-laden design.</p>

<p>From Pooh I wanted something like the Friends experience: I wanted to feel five or six (or eight at the most) years old again, enjoying the company of my beloved characters. Instead, the build experience is more like the Ninjago or Lamborghini. Everything is fiddly and overly detailed, requiring all sorts of unusual and strange methods to create a structure that could easily be made in a much simpler way. Challenging, too, for older, chubbier fingers like mine: there are several places in the build where you&#39;re called upon to place a tiny part in an area where it&#39;s really tight to get to.</p>

<p>And the final build is so crowded! There&#39;s really no place to play within the set itself. For example, the aforementioned Shopping Mall has all of these relatively open areas where the minidolls can shop or eat or wander around comfortably. The Pooh house has no open space, literally: you can see that from the photos on the LEGO website, all of which depict any actual play occurring on the table or floor OUTSIDE of the built interior structure.</p>

<p>The house exterior is gorgeous and in its way fun to build, but it&#39;s so small! The tree structure dwarfs it terribly. And the tree exterior area doesn&#39;t provide any more play area than the inside of the house! (Mind you, I wasn&#39;t really planning to do much playing myself; but I have a new grand-nephew who I was contemplating giving this to, and I just can&#39;t see how he&#39;d play with it.)</p>

<p>The last phase of the build, where you make six copies of the tree, each of which has four copies of a branch, is as repetitive and numbing a build as anything I can remember in all my years of LEGO making!</p>

<p>The minifigures are excellent though, and I will be keeping them and perhaps finding them a more hospitable place to live. The set itself, on display for now, will be taken apart soon. There are some magnificent new and interesting parts used in the set, and that will be its legacy for me.</p>

<p>But I have never been so disappointed in a LEGO build or a finished product as I was with this set. I get that a lot of folks are enjoying it, and I am glad for them. But my special memories of Pooh and his friends were not well served by this project.</p>

Half a year later the Hundred acre wood was 30% off in my country and I found this price acceptable therefore I bought it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I mostly buy Harry Potter and licensed sets, so I&#39;m not an expert just a casual Lego buyer. This set introduced me to some new building techniques and parts. At first&nbsp;I didn&#39;t understand why this&nbsp;set is 18+ (I know because all Ideas is 18+) but the truth is&nbsp;I underestimated the complexity of the build. I often had to look twice if I used the correct brick and I had to double-check&nbsp;if I did everything according to the instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favourite part was building the tree. This is the first Lego tree I built and the building process and the design are both amazing. It lights up my shelf with it&#39;s natural brown and green colour theme. The reds of the roof contrasts nicely with the natural colours. I love how you can adjust the position of the branches, this allows a little bit of customization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior of the house is like a little doll house, perfect for play. Warm, cute, cosy there&#39;s nothing more I can say other than that it&#39;s a tiny bit narrow, there&#39;s hardly any space inside. The set as a whole is on the smaller side. Inside the&nbsp;stove and outside the chimney are my favourite pieces.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about the mini figures. All of them are&nbsp;included for a reason but as other reviewers said before I terribly miss Owl! At least he should have been included! My favourite mini figure from the set is Tiger:&nbsp;the colour, the painting, the face even the tail is included, he is perfect in every possible way. My second favourite is a tie between Eeyore and Piglet. Both of them resemble the character well and looks very cute!&nbsp;As others said Winnie the Pooh is to thin but as far as I know that&#39;s how Lego handles belly. Other than that the colours and head are perfect. Rabbit is okay, but his face is a bit weird. His tail is only painted on his back. I wish they would have created a moulded piece like for Tiger and the Scrooge McDuck mini figure. I don&#39;t understand why rabbits doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t deserve&nbsp;a tail? (Think about Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny from the Looney tunes minifigure set.)</p>

<p>Overall the set is amazing, pictures doesn&#39;t do it justice! It&#39;s&nbsp;a great set if you can buy it on sale. It&#39;s much more complex than I thought. I think it&#39;s once in a lifetime chance to&nbsp;get the beloved Winnie the Pooh characters as mini figures you couldn&#39;t get otherwise.&nbsp;I&#39;m so grateful for the existence of this set so I could bring home the Hundred acre wood!&nbsp;</p>
