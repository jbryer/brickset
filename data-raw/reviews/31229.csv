<p>This set is honestly one of my favourite Star Wars sets to date; it is a very large build, with a technic structure on the inside. When building it, I thought it would be a very fragile build, but after completing it, I was impressed by how sturdy of a build it was.</p>

<p>The arms and zappers&nbsp;that can stick out work well. They&#39;re film accurate, to my knowledge. My favourite play feature, however,&nbsp;is within the head of R2. A small version of Luke&#39;s lightsaber can be hidden within, a fun build to do after the long process of building up R2&#39;s main body. His vision finder can pop out, like in&nbsp;<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>, but I find it to be a bit wobbly at times; not as solid as the other features.</p>

<p>I never found myself bored during the build, and was pleased with the final product, especially the rounded off dome (Opposed to the studded 2012 version). I recommend picking this up while it&#39;s still in stock, because if it rises in price like it&#39;s predecessor, you&#39;ll never forgive yourself.</p>
