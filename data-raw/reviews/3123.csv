"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T22:44:38Z","great detail","this set is really worth the money. First off, great set for getting your hands onto some more french imperial soldiers. This trading post looks great either next to lagoon lock up 6267 set or 6276 el dorado fortress or maybe even both. This set contains great detail including the unquie castle/pirate walls exposing the bricks where the plasta has come off either from old age or the strong weather in the caribean. This set contains the traditional feeling of the caribean including the palm tree and also the yellow and white colouring of this set. The only thing lacking in this set would be prob a pirate minifig, just to give it a little bit more a playbility feel to it. The cannon is on a black turn table covered by a small reinforcing wall.. Now onto the baseplate, very neat, lego trying to make it a tropical caribbean feel.
this set clearly marked as an out post containing the ekey mark of a big imperial french flag. People might complain about the tower sitting in some watter but truly most outpost in those days were built on lagoons and half in water.
extras.. many weapons including the cannon very important for an outpost. Comes with a boat..

i think this is a great set, try to pick it up on ebay or bricklink, very much worth the time to find it and the over all pleasure of this set.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set has a &quot;New England&quot; type coast feel even thought the island is pretty sandy.  I really like printed wall brick; it looks as though weathering has removed the plaster exposing the bricks.  The guard rails on the top of the outpost are a little bit out of porportion, but it still looks good with a minifig standing there.  The copy of the set I recieved had a cannon with a black firing pin, I still not sure how to make it work like the regular spring loaded cannons, but I won't detract for that because it wasn't the set that I got's fault it had a cannon like that.  The set could be made into a penetentary for pirates if some of the beams were moved.  I connected the set with my Eldorado Fortress.  Again, a fine example of a small LEGO set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The baseplate is a gem even though one corner of the tower sits in a few feet of water. The weathered tower looks like it could be at one of the Virgin Islands or lesser antilles. The top guardrails were undersized but still really neat looking. Saber island could definitely defend the harbor against a minor pirate assault, but to defend against a ship like the Black Seas Barracuda, it would need at the very least the aid of the Harbor Sentry and the Caribbean Clipper.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

the figures are great. you get two French Soldiers and Captain Jetsam. it's a three story tower, but is a bit too open. it needs the help of at least several Harbor Sentry 's and a Caribbean Clipper to fend off something like the Skull's Eye Schooner or Red Beard Runner. It would have trouble defeating Crossbone Clipper alone, and it might not even be able to do so. but that's okay, because it's not the Guards' biggest base, it's more of a sentry post, that a complete Pirate Lego freak might have 12 of and post them all around the Imperial Trading Post ( i reviewed that too) so that the pirates couldn't sneak up on it too easily. Stop complaining about the top level being out of proportion. it doesn't really matter. the fences are just there so that the guard up there doesn't just walk right off while he's patrolling. 
What kept this set from a 10 was the lack of ladders. yeah, there's a sentry post up top and a small area on the second level that you can just put your figures on, but, when you think about it, how the heck would they get up there? and how would they get down? they needed some ladders, real bad. Everyone shut up about part of the base being in the water. many sentry posts were like that, expecially the ones in lagoony areas. there is probably a sandbar right there and they just put a wooden frame there like they would do on a dock.

"MPH","2007-09-13T06:30:15.217Z","Great value for money","Sabre Island is amazing. A real jewel in my lego collection. Not that it's the greatest set ever, but for a set of this size it has so much to it. The place looks nice and tropical with that true caribbean atmosphere the first pirate sets had - although I will admit lego has chosen (as usual) the best angle of view to picture on the cover. From other sides the building looks a bit too open and fragile.

But nevermind. I like the height of the building, which makes it a good observation post and gives it a pretty unique function in the Imperial series. The small structure holding the cannon is a nice addition and gives perfect balance to the set.

From a parts point of view, this set is also outstanding. Three soldier minifigs is a huge amount and makes Sabre Island a very affordable army builder. Furthermore there is a cannon, a palm tree, a great baseplate, very useful wall pieces and... a large soldier flag! I don't think there's any other pirate set of this size containing a large flag. Big, big plus. There's also a boat, which maybe should have been a pirate boat to add some more playability. But I don't really care - got more than enough pirates from other sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparison to the Pirate's Counter of Shipwreck Island, this set is to me, far better then Shipwreck Island. Where Shipwreck Island feels crowded and overflowing with what's happening on it - Sabre Island makes far better use of the same Island Print Baseplate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's like a scaled down version of the Eldorado Fortress, but I've always imagined this as being built on an island close to and guarding the other side of the Port/Harbor entrance that the Imperials are protecting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a small Fort build with plenty of spaces for the Soldiers to move through and stand guard or fight from. There's a cannon, palm tree and rowboat for the soldiers of whom there are three, two soldiers and a captain.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful set, while the Pirates are more exciting to get and play with, they'd be nothing without the Imperial Soldiers to oppose them and where function of a play set goes, this is far better designed then some of the Pirate islands.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,5
"iamcjb","2011-01-12T18:24:34.747Z","Great starter set","<p>This was my first pirate set which I got when I was about 6 years old. I recently put it together again to see why I got so much use out of it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No complaints here. Instructions are simple to follow.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is a good mixture considering the small amount of pieces. Two parts that I really like are the white ""Castle"" walls, especially the damaged wall, and the bricks for creating the cannon bunker. I picked the bricks for the cannon bunker in particular because it was the first time I had come across bricks of those kind and I remember thinking how different they were to the usual 4x2 bricks and castle wall pieces. The fort also comes with a small flag and a great large flag.&nbsp;It also have a boat with oars. Finally, the board is not plain blue or green, but has an island surrounded by water which is a nice touch.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get 3 Imperial soldiers, one of which is a captain. I think the troops are the best looking units in the pirate range and I tend not to see them as much as the red replacements which came along later. The backpacks are a cool feature and they can easily pass as a city item. Unfortunately there are no pirates which means another set is required for battles which is the only drawback to the minifigs.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is straightforward using a combination of small pieces, castle walls, fences and a few pillar pieces. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The fort is very impressive considering the size of the set. I often found the tower could easily be converted to a medieval style tower or an old city block with only a few piece changes which gives the tower plenty of use outside the ""Pirates"" theme. The cannon actually works well which gave me and my friends years of enjoyment shooting at each others Lego warriors. The rowing boat and palm tree are good cosmetic additions, and like the tower can easily fit into other themes. Finally the large flag looks majestic and I really wish more of these were about. They would look great even on a large fort or castle.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For such a small and basic set, it gives a lot of fun. The build isn't overly complex which would suit new builders, but contains a varied enough range of pieces to use &nbsp;bit of time. The three minifigs are a great way to start an army to hunt down Brickbeard and I think they are some of the better looking models in the theme. The shape and simplicity of the tower allows it to be easily modified which makes it a great choice for anyone who is undecided on a set. It would take minimal bricks to create something to fit into ""Castle"" or ""City"". The cannon and rowing also add a bit of fun, and add more to battles than jsut having the 3 troops. Overall this is a strong set and worth buying.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
"mr_hazey","2011-06-13T18:06:20.783Z","Sabre Island","The set was first released in 1989 and is one of the oldest Pirate sets. The set comes with 96 pieces and 3 minifigures so plenty to get stuck into. 
<p>I have to say out of all the sets I have bought off ebay this one came with the best kept instruction manual, it look in new condition still which is always a plus, just a shame there was no box with it. After the pieces had air dried I set about building the set, firstly I built the 3 mini figures&nbsp;which took less then a minute and for a set that is over 20 years old all 3 were in top condition. I always like the solders first time round with the shoulder pads and rucksacks as well, the only fault I found was one pair of legs had a small scuff on it’s foot so will look at replacing them at some point.</p>
<p>Next up was the rowing boat, for the life of me I could never understand why they did red rowing boats, I still prefer the brown ones as they give a more realistic feel to a set and is the only negative on an otherwise great set. So anyway I built the boat and was very happy to find every piece in top condition still, including the oars <IMG class=wp-smiley alt=:) src=""http://thehazey.co.uk/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif""> &nbsp; Next was the island itself which I put off till last as when I first owned the set it was one of my fav sets and still is now and to pay less then £30.00 for it was a massive bonus. So the Island board is the same as the one use it set 6260 another excellent set, the board was like new after a good wash and after looking at the instructions tried to do it from memory having last built it in the early 90's but I failed and decided to do it the right way and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>The instructions split into 10 easy steps and took me about 10 minutes from start to finish to build, all the way through checking the pieces for any damage etc. I am happy to report that all pieces were as new. This set came with the big wall side panels including one that has the brick print on it to give a more realistic look to the tower. The tower once complete gives you 3 levels to which to play on and my only minor fault would be the lack of any ladders to access the top 2 levels. This set came with a rotating base for the cannon which fires, I still love to fire those cannons at targets and a palm tree which I love to build. For my set the only pieces that I will need to replace are the two rifles and two swords as all 4 had been heavily used by the looks of things, all 4 will be replaced by new ones later this week. However they did not take away from what is a fantastic set that is a joy to build but also gives you a great set to add to your collection, anyone who is into Pirates I fully recommend getting this and you can pick a decent set up for around £25.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"James83","2021-08-18T15:24:19.513Z","Watch Out for Fun!","<p>This was the second Pirate structure that I brought with some saved pocket money and became a favourite of mine. It is a simple tower but provided so much&nbsp;fun.</p>

<p><strong>The Building</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the base, this unique printed 16x16 baseplate with its desert island was only used for two sets, making it pretty rare. It looks good and certainly provides the perfect base for the tower. A palm tree is also provided.</p>

<p>The lower floor consists of a room build up from two wall panel bricks with arched windows. The tower is easy to build, the parts count is fairly low, but it never feels too cheap and the yellow bricks add variety to the colour.&nbsp;Two sides of the room are open for access. One of them leads to a cannon mounted on a turntable with a wall around it, which includes some nice angled bricks. A supply of six black stud bricks are provided for ammunition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upper floor is made up from one wall panel brick, with printed brick detailing, two sides are open and the fourth has a grey fencing grill to form a sort of balcony. The roof (which is slightly bigger than the building beneath it!)&nbsp;forms another platform with a small wall made up of grill bricks. There are two clips and a headlight brick for stowing items - a cutlass, a flagpole with a large printed Imperial flag and a lamp with yellow cone &#39;flame&#39;. The interior comes unequipped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The garrison need a means to get vittles in, so they have a red rowboat, complete with a small printed Imperial flag at the stern.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with two Imperial soldiers, complete with backpacks and an Imperial officer. This is quite a generous supply of minifigs for what is a small building set.&nbsp;Arms include two flintlock rifles, a flintlock pistol and a cutlass.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This tower provided lots of fun, mostly because it has a cannon (and the cannonballs) to blast pirate ships and because with three minifigs you really had enough men to stage a decent fight with the pirates. The two empty rooms are big enough to put your own furniture inside.&nbsp;I built up the wall around the roof, adding a 2-brick high crenellated wall to complete the fortress look.&nbsp;You could also easily add another floor if you wished or&nbsp;extend this set as part of Lagoon Lock-Up 6267 with some additional black flat bricks to form a pier to join the two. A great little set that is very adaptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>5/5. This is a great example of late 80&#39;s Lego at its best:&nbsp; colorful, great figures, great parts, and even a mini baseplate in such a small set.&nbsp; The only flaw with this one is the lack of a pirate adversary, but any respectable Lego fan in the 80&#39;s would have had plenty of pirates.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>Less than 100 parts and somehow feels like even fewer when you&#39;re building this.&nbsp; It comes together very quickly without any real challenge, but if you were a kid wanting to get a fort set up for your pirate ship to attack, this would have been perfect.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Two great flags, one of my favorite printed &quot;castle pieces&quot;, a palm tree, a cannon, a row boat, 2 soldiers and an officer with a cool beard.&nbsp; Not to mention a nice island mini baseplate.&nbsp; Parts selection in this set is fantastic considering the era.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>As mentioned, it is missing an enemy pirate, but assuming you&#39;ve got some already, the playability with this set is great.&nbsp; Wage war from the balconies or fire the cannon!&nbsp; Sword fights in the sand and flee in your rowboat.&nbsp; This was a fun set back in the day.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Looking at the price of $15 it does seem a bit pricey for the day.&nbsp; That would be probably $35 now for 3 figs and &lt; 100 pieces.&nbsp; But given the size of some of those pieces and the baseplate, it was probably worth it.&nbsp; Since it&#39;s still worth about $30 used, I&#39;d say it was still a good buy...&nbsp; Now I just need to decide if I should sell mine or display it...&nbsp; So many great sets and so little shelf space.&nbsp; :-)</p>

In second place would be the base plate and the cool white walls with red brick being exposed on it. They aren&#39;t stickers but actually printed on like that which to me makes it even better so you don&#39;t have to worry about peeling or trying to put the stickers on in the right place.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>As a kid you could spend days playing with this set but as an adult I just put it on display so the playability of putting it on display as well is&nbsp;great! Doesn&#39;t take up a lot of space but it is taller than you&#39;d expect and makes it feel like a good watch tower overlooking the waters that the Blue Coats protect.</p>

<p><strong>Value for your Money:</strong></p>

<p>At the time, it was good value for your money. Now, with it being rare and older, the cost of getting a set can run up to $100 for a used opened one and more expensive for a brand-new one. It&#39;s really up to you to decide if it&#39;s that valuable for your money. For me, I think I paid a bit more than I should have but it&#39;s still great value in my opinion, and keep in mind the bigger Imperial Fort sets are very expensive so this is a good cheaper alternative.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
