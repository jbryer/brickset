"Struhadlo","2021-08-02T19:12:57.457Z","Strikingly better than you might think","<p>This particular duel was a&nbsp;certain lock ever since the finale of the 7th season of the fan favourite TV show The Clone Wars has aired. I have no idea why it took a year to make the set, but it is here, and it is... well better than it looks.</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>The set comes at a set price for these duel sets of $20 which seems pretty steep considering the volume of stuff we are getting here and to be perfectly just it is by far the smallest of the recent duel sets which were <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75236-1/Duel-on-Starkiller-Base"" target=""_blank"">75236</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75269-1/Duel-on-Mustafar"" target=""_blank"">75269</a>&nbsp;both having a substantially&nbsp;larger builds. Part of the price is probably in the minifigs both of which come with a specialised rubber moulds. I would either make the wall behind the throne 2 studs wider,&nbsp;by adding 2 studs wide orange panel with a sticker in the middle, or decrease the price to $15. The set is not horrendously overpriced, and quite frankly at this price point it would not be the end of the world, it just does not feel justified.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>Probably the strongest suit of the set are the very desirable minifigs one of which is completely brand new.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Darth Maul. Our beloved walking and talking retcon comes in a completely new style with new torso and a leg print. Maul boasts a very detailed torso and back print with the attention to the torso to legs continuity as his waist is also not left unprinted. His legs come with a toe printing which is always welcomed. The whole body is in gun metal grey. Unfortunately the hilt of his dual bladed lightsaber is not the new longer piece introduced in the first wave of Monkey Kid sets, but the regular lightsaber hilt. Otherwise, a fantastic minifigure.</li>
	<li>Ahsoka. This is the second appearance of this particular Ahsoka figure. The only other way to obtain her is in the infamous <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank"" target=""_blank"">75283</a>&nbsp;which by the way is in my opinion a far better set than people make it to be. The body and the legs both come with a decent print depicting her garments from the show. She, unlike her adversary, has dual faced head. One of the expressions is an angry one and the other is a somewhat neutral. The rubber mould has a very well done print but the very ends of the tentacles tend to get scratched and loose the colour very quickly. My first Ahsoka from the previously mentioned AAT lost the blue colour at the&nbsp;tips in a matter of few days. Furthermore, I still feel like this&nbsp;mould is wee bit oversized. The citizen is armed with two regular blue lightsabers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I find the minifigs to be quite strong in this set, I would just like to see Lego making&nbsp;a new, shorter lightsaber blade as the Ahsoka is a prime candidate to premiere such weapon.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised&nbsp;by how extremely enjoyable the building experience was. I might have a thing for smaller sets, but I just had a blast while completing this set. The prison is a pretty simple build which has two doors accidentally, as you can open the door&nbsp;and the transparent window piece with the sticker on it. While applying the stickers be extra careful as you want the frontal sticker centred and the control panel on the side too. Both of these stickers are somewhat difficult to apply perfectly, keep that in mind. While a prisoner is on the inside, you can see their eyes perfectly. Maul can gaze on you sinisterly just like in the show.</p>

<p>The throne has no special surprises except for a hidden gun compartment under the main seat. The stickers on the two orange pieces simulating the window should be applied with a special care as you do not want an awkward gap in between. Finally, you can throw a minifig through&nbsp;that window which is placed on a moving brick at the bottom causing it to fall back and open. The only demerit of the build is the size of the window. You truly cannot throw Maul through while he is holding his lightsaber unless you position it vertically. This problem could be solved by adding another orange panel with a sticker in the middle. There is one more sticker at the feet of the throne.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>As far as playability goes, there are three play functions in total. You can close a minifig into the prison cell, throw a figure through the window and open up the gun compartment under the seat&nbsp;and that is about it. It might feel pretty bare bones but with so little to work with build wise, it is quite a lot of fun in such a small package.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, this set proves to be much more fun from the building experience to play value than meets the eye. It is a very well done representation of the actual scene and the minifigs are top-notch. &nbsp;It is also a great displayable piece thanks to the outstanding colour combination and fine details courtesy of the stickers and great building technique.&nbsp;</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-10-03T13:42:47.803Z","Surprisingly good builds, that still donâ€™t make up for the price ","<p>I had my eyes on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank-(AAT)"">AAT</a>&nbsp;mainly for the inclusion of the season 7 Ahsoka minifigure. When this set got revealed, it was clear that this was a better way to obtain the figure with the set being half the price of the AAT and it included a Darth Maul figure, which I&rsquo;ve never had before so that was also an awesome bonus. The build seemed alright but severely small for the price.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><b>The Vault:</b> This was a pretty basic build as it didn&rsquo;t really need many pieces to go into it, but the resulting model does look nice. The stickers pretty much do all the heavy lifting, with a large sticker for the front panel which looks very neat and a sticker on the side for some control panels. Darth Maul can easily fit into the refrigera- I mean, vault&nbsp;&nbsp;and he stares menacingly through the small transparent area of the panel.</p>

<p><b>The Throne: </b>The throne consists of simple and rather basic pieces but are well-used and make the build pretty interesting. With such a compact design, I&rsquo;d think it would be hard to include play features but 2 were managed to be snuck in. One of which is a hidden pistol compartment under the seat and the other is to knock down the trans-orange glass behind the throne to simulate throwing a figure through the glass. Additional details include a sticker at the bottom of the throne, 2 orange leaf pieces used as decoration and 2 stickers used for the trans-orange window. Overall, while there&rsquo;s not much to do with it and the play functions don&rsquo;t add too much, it still remains an enjoyable and interesting build, not amazing but I like it.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Ahsoka Tano: </b>While I&rsquo;m nowhere near reaching season 7 of the Clone Wars as of the time of writing this, I was still excited to get this Ahsoka minifigure in hand. Ahsoka wears a dark blue jumpsuit and it looks spot-on, though the legs could&rsquo;ve benefited from the use dual-molding as the dark blue awkwardly cuts off at the side. The face prints include a confident smile and an angry expression, the latter face is a bit more subtle in the emotion being expressed which is nice, I want to see Lego do more subtle expressions. Some people have complained that Ahsoka&rsquo;s montrals are too long and should&rsquo;ve used a new piece altogether, but I personally don&rsquo;t mind it at all, and I think it looks good, the printing on it also neat. Finally, Ahsoka wields 2 blue lightsabers, something about the blade looks better this time around as well and I can&rsquo;t exactly place why. Overall, it could&rsquo;ve used dual-molded legs to improve the figure, but other than that, it&rsquo;s perfect and I&rsquo;m happy with it.</p>

<p><b>Darth Maul:</b> The exclusive Darth Maul in this set is just as appealing and desirable to me as the Ahsoka figure, and with it being my first Darth Maul figure also helps a lot. The legs feature some great mechanical detailing with some nice shine to it. His torso is a sith robe that has a wide belt with more of that nice shine to it and Maul&rsquo;s chest is partially exposed as well. The face uses the neutral expression from the<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw1091/darth-maul-printed-mechanical-legs-(crimson-dawn-crime-lord)"">&nbsp;Crimson Dawn</a>&nbsp;figure, I, for one, am glad Lego got rid of the creepy smile expression. The zabrak horns piece looks good and I was surprised with the inclusion of an extra! Finally, Maul comes with a double-bladed lightsaber, people have expressed disappointment for not using the Monkie Kid hilt but I personally don&rsquo;t mind. Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with how Maul came out, his detailing (especially the metallic shine) looks great and I&rsquo;m glad I got this as my first&nbsp;Darth Maul.</p>

<h3>Vale for Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The R370 (basically &ldquo;20 dollars&rdquo;) price is continually used for the duel sets, and it feels pretty unjustified with this set in particular. Whereas the other duel sets felt a bit overpriced but you can still somewhat see some level of reasonability to it, you can see none with this one. I guess on top of the Star Wars tax, Lego also knew that anyone would buy this set regardless of the price because it contains 2 great and desirable figures, which really sucks. It should&rsquo;ve been priced at R250-R300 max.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually surprised by how much I enjoyed putting this set together and&nbsp;&nbsp;enjoyed the set as a whole. The throne and the vault both do a pretty good job of representing the on-screen appearance. Though obviously the figures take the spotlight and are still the main selling point of this set, they&rsquo;re great and I&rsquo;m happy with their inclusion in a cheap (relatively speaking) way. The set&rsquo;s value is really bad, and even to call it poor is probably still an understatement. Following a good discount, I would certainly recommend this set, especially for those who didn&rsquo;t end up getting the AAT.</p>

"Naylus","2022-01-01T17:59:20.14Z","Throne of Sundari ","<p>While I&#39;m not much into the&nbsp;resurrection of Darth Maul, I enjoyed the Clone Wars finale, and this set caught my attention. It&#39;s rather small and reminds me of old Lego Star Wars sets, released in 2000s, like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7204-1/Jedi-Defense-II"">Jedi Defense</a> for example.</p>

<p><strong>General overview</strong><br />
The build is rather simple and not impossible to complete without an instruction &ndash; a wall, a throne with lamps, a prison box&nbsp;and 2 minifigures. The overall design of the area is good, with dark grey walls and orange glass as a perfect contrast. Almost like in the TV series, even though it was a much larger hallway there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The window can be &quot;broken&quot; to imitate destruction during an intense fight. The throne itself includes a secret cache with a blaster. In fact this is the part I like the most. Except maybe for the stickers on the glasses &ndash; they cover only half the glass and give a feel of an incomplete design. Stickers themselves &ndash; are a mild drawback to this set, as you have to apply 2 on the orange transparent parts, so that they were at similar level. Not that difficult, but still.</p>

<p><strong>The vault</strong><br />
The Prison box is somehow disappointing visually. I can&#39;t get rid of the idea, that I were making some kind of a fridge and not a Mandalorian vault. In the episode it has red light inside, so a red glass would be a more proper piece in this set perhaps. Also in the series the lid opens like that of a sarcophagus, while here it&#39;s a simple &#39;door&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Ahsoka and Maul</strong><br />
The minifigures are awesome however. Ahsoka&nbsp;grew quite an interesting character over the years, so this mature version of her is a very nice addition to the collection. The print is well-detailed and she wields two lightsabers like in the show.</p>

<p>Darth Maul (or simply Maul) is well renovated &ndash; it has a perfect print on body and face, a good variant to combine with one of the older versions like in Episode I.</p>

<p>As a whole this is an interesting set for those, who enjoyed the show and some Star Wars fans. The build includes a few rare colours, but I like that most of the bricks are quite simple, which means it&#39;s easier to assemble something completely new here &ndash; like a different section of the Palace on Mandalore. Too bad there are a few sticker here.</p>

"NYBuilder","2021-11-29T14:35:52.753Z","You may think this set is evil...","<p>I feel like am I rating this higher than I should, but I feel like at the price point it leaves a lot to be desired. The best part&nbsp;of this set are without a doubt&nbsp;the mini-figures, this is the cheapest and most efficient way to get Ashoka and Maul who are both extremely detailed and great to have. The throne is detailed and cool for what it is but still leaves you wanting more.</p>

<p>The 147 pieces count does not match the $19.99 price tag, if you have these mini-figures this is a skip, unless you are looking purely for playability which this set does provide a bit of. Not as much as the Duel on Mustafar set however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Love the mini-figures, disappointed in the set design and pieces. Pass unless you need the figures.</p>

"Torrent_Studios","2022-05-09T05:58:21.237Z","Overpriced set with decent design.","<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
<br />
The Clone Wars Season 7 was a glorious sendoff to a childhood TV show that many of us Star Wars fans no doubt grew up with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This LEGO set represents a climactic scene during the first part of the finale arc, where Maul requests Ahsoka Tano&#39;s help in defeating Darth Sidious together, but ends up having to duel Ahsoka instead in an epic lightsaber fight sequence.&nbsp;(surely he needs to work on his message&nbsp;delivery skills)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also this is the first review I&#39;ve ever written for a Star Wars box set :)<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The box is a small rectangular shape with some nice Star Wars border design. The set is placed in front of an attractive Mandalore Throne Room background, and Maul and Ahsoka are shown duelling each other in front of the throne and vault.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and Build</strong><br />
<br />
Inside the box&nbsp;are the 147&nbsp;pieces and a few small spares, and a small instruction&nbsp;manual.<br />
<br />
It took me roughly 10 minutes&nbsp;to put everything together at a half-leisurely speed.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
<br />
The minifigures included are of course appropriate to this scene, including a brand new Maul,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;Ahsoka who returns&nbsp;from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank-(AAT)"">75283 Armored Assault Tank (AAT)</a>.<br />
<br />
Over the years, <strong>Ahsoka </strong>has grown from a bratty Padawan who takes after her master Anakin, to quite a likeable character.<br />
<br />
Her&nbsp;minifigure here is decent, but is not flawless. In fact, these flaws return from her previous appearance in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank-(AAT)"">75283 Armored Assault Tank (AAT)</a>, which notably include head-tails, or lekku, that are too long when compared to. This piece was originally developed for Shaak Ti, who had lekku of this length, but LEGO decided to reissue&nbsp;this piece again for the new Ahsoka, which was a bad decision in my opinion, and a new piece was definitely warranted and could prove useful for future variants of Ahsoka, especially because Ahsoka has been appearing in more and more Star Wars instalments.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the rest of the minifigure is quite accurately detailed. Dual moulded arms or&nbsp;arm printing could prove useful though, to represent the Mandalorian gauntlets that cover Ahsoka&#39;s wrists. A minor issue that I personally have with this minifigure is the blue colour of the eyes, which I think should&#39;ve been black like regular minifigures. Ahsoka comes with two identical blue-bladed lightsabers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Maul</strong> appears in this set with an updated&nbsp;minifigure, reflecting his newest appearance in The Clone Wars. The torso and leg printing is excellent, with Maul&#39;s robes open to reveal his chest. The gunmetal grey base is also a great colour choice.</p>

<p>The mechanical detail printed on Maul&#39;s robotic legs are printed on this occasion. It is mildly disappointing that the unique&nbsp;elements designed for Maul from 2013&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75022-1/Mandalorian-Speeder"">75022 Mandalorian Speeder</a>&nbsp;did not return, but those weren&#39;t necessarily accurate in terms of height, so the new design is completely acceptable. Maul comes with his trademark double-bladed red lightsaber.<br />
<br />
<strong>Builds</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The main build of the set is the <b>Throne of Mandalore</b>, a well-known setting in which many events of The Clone Wars take place. The throne build is in front of an&nbsp;orange glass window with a Mandalorian pattern design, the build of which incorporates one of the main play features of the set: the trans-orange 1x2x5 pillars can be easily dropped backward, with which you can recreate Maul being launched through the window by Ahsoka after the first part of their duel.<br />
<br />
The stickers applied on the pillars are annoying to some, but they achieve a good effect. The shape of the hole created isn&#39;t the most accurate, considering Maul&#39;s lightsaber pierces narrow slits next to the hole, but it&#39;s good enough with LEGO&#39;s limits. The orange leaf pieces are also used nicely to recreate the orange flower pattern next to the large window.<br />
<br />
The throne itself is mildly oversized, most notably on the slanted sides, but the details on all sides are great and look accurate. Maul looks great seated on the brown 2x3 space. The throne&#39;s construction techniques allow for a hollow middle, in which a small drawer can be concealed into it, forming part of the side. The drawer contains a black&nbsp;blaster pistol, which can&nbsp;be&nbsp;lost since the drawer is not attached to anything and will easily fall out.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The side build of this set (whose size is comparable to the throne&#39;s) is the Mandalorian Vault, which was specifically designed by Mandalorians to restrain Jedi and other Force&nbsp;wielders.&nbsp;In Bo-Katan Kryze&#39;s own words: &quot;<i>A relic of a bygone era when Mandalorians had reason to imprison you Force-wielding maniacs.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>The design&nbsp;of the vault is very accurate and&nbsp;looks great to me, the dimensions being 3x4x7 studs. The small window that Maul looks through is cleverly recreated in LEGO form by putting a mostly decorated transparent sticker on a transparent panel. One last sticker provides detail on the side of the vault&#39;s lid, depicting the buttons to control&nbsp;the vault.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Strictly, the vault is not in this scene, but rather appears in the scene directly&nbsp;after where Maul is finally captured. While the inclusion of the vault gives this set more value, I can&#39;t help&nbsp; but imagine the possibilities if the vault was not included. Perhaps the price of this set would be lowered a fair bit which would make this set more worth it.<br />
<br />
Also, this probably means we won&#39;t be getting a Clone Wars <em>Nu</em>-class shuttle anytime soon, since in&nbsp;one of the last times the vault appeared, the <em>Nu</em>-class shuttle was there too, and the inclusion of the vault would&#39;ve made a great play feature in a hypothetical Nu-class shuttle playset.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my rant about that ends here...<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
This small set has a nice&nbsp;amount of play features and would not disappoint the target audience - 7 year olds. The breaking window is a nice feature, but it results in the window itself being very weak and easily dropped. It is very easily restored though, and very minor modifications from an AFOL&#39;s collection will solidify it.<br />
<br />
The two minifigures each represent the&nbsp;hero and villain factions, which kids can use to stage their own fight scenes.<br />
<br />
The vault can also come into play, where kids can lock Maul in it. Ahsoka does not fit in it, but the vault was definitely not designed with her in mind and did not need to be.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall</strong><br />
<br />
I picked this set up with&nbsp;at 22.99 AUD on a whim, which was less than the RRP of 32.99 here in Australia,&nbsp;so the price for me was decent.<br />
<br />
The overall design of the set is great, and the new Maul minifigure is superb.&nbsp;But for full price, I simply wouldn&#39;t recommend this set since the value is just not worth it.<br />
<br />
Another minifigure would definitely make this set worth it though, like a 332nd trooper or even a new Captain Rex.</p>

"LEGODUDE1","2022-08-11T02:35:04.577Z","Decent for its price","<p><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75310-1/Duel-on-Mandalore"">75310: Duel on Mandalore</a>&nbsp;recreates one of the pivotal moments of the Clone Wars Season 7: Ahsoka Tano&#39;s duel with Darth Maul in the Mandalore throne room. This small set manages to capture much of that with only 147 pieces, and is overall a good set.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>The Maul minifigure is exclusive to this set, and it is similar to all the other Maul minifigures apart from the torso and legs, which emphasise his cybernetic replacements. I like this one better than the others, because it is one of the few ones to portray Maul during the Clone Wars.</p>

<p>Ahsoka is included in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank-(AAT)"">75283: Armored Assault Tank (AAT)</a>, but this is a cheaper alternative for those who want her minifigure. I like it better than the other Ahsoka minifigures - the earlier Clone Wars one looked too animated, and the Rebels one...</p>

<p>We don&#39;t speak of the Rebels one.</p>

<p><b>Parts / Building Experience</b></p>

<p>The set overall had more than I expected - it took about 12 minutes to make - and while I am not a professional Lego builder - I did expect less. There is actually a lot of detail and useful parts in this set, and my only complaint about it is how the glass behind the throne doesn&#39;t completely fit within the archway - there is a small gap. But this is barely a big deal and doesn&#39;t really matter at all. Overall, I had fun building it.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>It has many play features, including the ability to break the window behind the throne, and includes a secret compartment containing a blaster underneath the throne, and an openable box to place Maul inside. I think this set is really good for recreating the duel between Maul and Ahsoka. It could have been slightly bigger and maybe captured more of the throne room besides literally just the throne, but most of the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;sets focused on a specific duel are typically small.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>I bought this set for $20.00, and I feel like it could have been a little cheaper - this is the bare minimum of prices for Lego&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;sets typically, and for nearly 150 pieces, it would probably be more suited as $15. But for the well-made minifigures and play features, I&#39;d say $20 isn&#39;t the worst deal.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>75310: Duel on Mandalore is a small set, but it recreates a good scene, and is a decent set for its price. I would have maybe liked to see a Bo-Katan minfigure, maybe one without the helmet. But overall, this set is worth it for fans of&nbsp;<em>The Clone Wars</em>&nbsp;and for people looking for a small set with many features in store.&nbsp;</p>
