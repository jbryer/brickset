"Wurger","2021-08-08T09:05:16.01Z","A Good Vehicle with a Great Selection of Minifigures","<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">When I saw the 75311 reviews with the new Artillery Stormtrooper and Greef Karga minifigure, I loved them! The vehicle itself was ok, I understand LEGO used a 6-stud-wide design to keep the price down and cheaper for collectors that buy sets for army building. As I am a vehicle type of guy; instead of building two Marauders, I decided to build a 8-stud-wide vehicle that can seat 6 minifigures side by side, and 1 minifigure beneath the dorsal turret.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">I have a discussion topic on this MOD on Eurobricks forum,&nbsp;https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/187012-mod-imperial-trexler-armored-marauder-upgrade-modifications-using-pieces-from-two-75311-sets/</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">The overall Marauder is widened by 2 studs and lengthened by 2 studs (1-stud on the sponsons&nbsp;and 1 stud on the cockpit). The new model measures 22cm in length and 11cm in width (8cm without the sponsons).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">The hull is widened by using two 2x16 dark bluish grey plates on the sides of the 6x10 black plate as the base. An extra roof tile is added to the sponsons with 2x3 inverted roof tile replacing the 1x3 one to lengthen the sponsons between the lateral laser cannons and storage container. The trans-light blue engine outlets are lengthened to 4 round plates each, sitting on a 2x4 plate with two 1x2 grille pieces.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">For the cockpit, my first version simply widened the front and top panels to 6 studs, but the vertical frames are too wide apart and don&rsquo;t represent the Marauder&rsquo;s notched front well. I changed to front and top panels back to the original 4 studs, used 3x3 light bluish grey corner plates for the top panels, 28192 45 &deg; slopes and SNOT techniques to mount laser cannons. Each chair sits on two 1x2 1 stud plate, so they are offset by half a stud each, allowing two stormtroopers to sit next to each other side by side. The plates on the side doors are changed to 2x2 special 2-stud plates and 1x2 door rail plates.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">I removed all stud shooters and used original LEGO&rsquo;s design for all my laser cannons, Lego included a spare reddish brown 3L bar, a black technic pin and a black lightsaber hilt for each set, so I have enough parts for all six cannons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">I went through more than ten different variants of dorsal turret before settling on the current version, the thought of why didn&rsquo;t I think of this before always comes to my mind. The current version is 6-stud-wide, relatively round and low profile. The latest laser gun mounts with elevation are designed by bruce_swift.</p>

"Bowtie_Bricks","2021-08-12T17:23:58.15Z","It might be a giant block, but it still has some playability","<p>The Marauder isn&#39;t really a complicated shape in universe, so it&#39;s safe to say that I think they managed to knock the shape out of the park. But the figures are what make it worth the $40.</p>

<p>The standout to the set is clearly the figures. The mortar trooper is outstanding, with even the cannon being a good size. Karga is a worthy inclusion, and better than the previous version. The stormtoopers fit with the set, and are decent figures.</p>

<p>What amazes me the most is how much the set can fit; the cockpit can fit a figure just fine, and I enjoy the 2 way opening. The main interior can fit 2, almost 3, figures in it. My only complaint is that it isn&#39;t too easy to access it; only the side doors and the trapdoor piece are what can be opened to reveal the open interior. The canons and storage on the side look great, and work fine.</p>

<p>The back canon is by far my favourite. With the back being able to fold down, it allows a trooper to slide into the seat, and into the dome. What I love about it is how it can&#39;t do a 360, accurate to the in universe design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it is worth the $40, and would recommend waiting until a promo or a small percent off, just for good measure.</p>

"wookiee1138","2021-12-13T04:53:09.13Z","Surprised","<p>I just didn&#39;t expect much, but I was wrong. I watched Jang&#39;s review, and thought &#39;I&#39;ll throw it on my Christmas list as an inexpensive option.&#39; My sister delighted me with the set, and I finished it tonight. I currently have the included stormtroopers plus 3 more&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>an imperial officer occupying the model. What a delight!</p>

<p>One of my favorite sets is 75106 Imperial Assault carrier. If you look at the thing, it&#39;s kind of an ugly grey blob like so many Star Wars ships. But that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to look, and it&#39;s actually an incredibly fun&nbsp;<em>toy</em>&nbsp;with incredible building technique. This is a much smaller model, but just as good of a toy!</p>

"Corkscrew_Brik36","2021-12-23T14:46:15.17Z","More than just a big, grey blob.","<p>First appearing in The Mandalorian Season 2, the Marauder is a pretty tough and thick vehicle, and not like much we&#39;ve seen previously in the Star Wars universe. All that being said, this is a very good&nbsp;and faithful&nbsp;recreation of the Armoured Marauder in LEGO form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The build, while not very attractive in total, has very nice detailed armour on the exterior, and good details on the inside. There are 6 total spaces to hold minifigures:&nbsp;the cockpit;&nbsp;one seat in-between the&nbsp;doors;&nbsp;two seats underneath an opening hatch on the top of the build;&nbsp;one in the gunner&#39;s seat;&nbsp;and one peeking out of a smaller hatch up on top, Making this a perfect troop transport.</p>

<p>Two small flaps on each side also reveal small boxes reading &quot;CARGO&quot;&nbsp;in Aurebesh, the written language in the Star Wars universe. A door towards the back reveals a seat that spins in order to control the turrets on top of the Marauder. The doors on each side, while functional, are unfortunately too small to fit a minifigure inside standing up or walking out, which is a bit of a let-down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures included in this set are quite nice! We receive an updated Greef Karga, a brand new Artillery Stormtrooper, and two regular Stormtroopers. The Artillery Stormtrooper is a really well-made and detailed figure, with a backpack build and a nice yellow pauldron. Greef Karga is a great new figure, appearing accurate to his&nbsp;Season 2 appearance. Only disappointment is that he has no alternate face. The two regular Stormtroopers seem ordinary until their helmets are removed, revealing exclusive new faces. One is a rather angry woman in Light Nougat, and the other is a determined male in Reddish Brown. One could say the faces seem like forced diversity, but unless one of the designers confesses to that we&#39;ll never know. I&#39;m just happy that the infamous Angry Clone Head seems to be eradicated from Stormtroopers!</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a nice set. It&#39;s great for carrying troops, as well as army building (if you&#39;re into that). I also can&#39;t complain about the price, since for nearly 500 pieces you are only paying $40. The &quot;Star Wars tax&quot; that some fans speak of seems to not apply to this set either! 8/10, would recommend.</p>
