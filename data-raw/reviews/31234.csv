<p>This new ship is the smallest&nbsp;one we have seen so far compared to other starships, however at the price point it is almost unbeatable. It is detailed and solid and can be displayed landed or with an upright base which is a fun feature to have. The addition of Boba Fett&#39;s min-figure is great, with one minor gripe being the helmet does not match the rest of his armor. The Mandalorian minfigure is amazing if you have not picked up a set with him already, with detailed arm printing, and colorizations. The addition of the beskar spear is also a nice&nbsp;touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest issue I personally have with this set is the display stand it comes with. It is flimsy&nbsp;and does not properly clip the ship into a safe and secure postion. Which could easily result in its demise. Overall it is not a must have, but if you are in the market for a new starship and have not picked up one recently this is the most effective and economical&nbsp;choice.</p>

"Bogdan501st","2022-01-28T12:23:16.24Z","Great for both play and display","<p>I bought this set on release, since I previously only owned the <a href=""https://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75222-1/75222_Front_02.jpg"">mini Slave I</a>&nbsp;that came with&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75222-1/Betrayal-at-Cloud-City"">75222 Betrayal at Cloud City</a>. I was expecting a similar ship in size and level of detail, however my expectations were greatly surpassed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Play value</strong></p>

<p>This set is packed with play features. Two unobtrusive stud shooters are integrated into the hull. They are easy to access and function very well, as always. The black cannons in the front can rotate independently.&nbsp;The cockpit can comfortably fit one minifigure and the wings on the side lean with gravity. The model features the infamous cargo hold, where you can store a Gamorrean frozen in carbonite, included in the set. On the back of the ship, there is a Technic handle that can be folded into the hull. Upon folding it out, the ship can be held by it&nbsp;and thus it is very easy to fly it around.&nbsp;The speeder side build is a fun addition, however its main purpose&nbsp;is aesthetic (more on that later). The inclusion of two minifigures is welcome, and it allows for endless role-play scenarios.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Display value</strong></p>

<p>As&nbsp;stated in the title of this review, this set doubles as a play and display piece. It is a far more affordable and compact version when compared to previous renditions of the Slave I, however&nbsp;it achieves comparable level of detail and arguably superior accuracy. I feel like this set features better proportions. Also, its shaping very closely matches what is seen on screen. The dark red base features intricate angular bricks&nbsp;that perfectly capture the shape. As this Slave I is inspired by its look in The Mandalorian show, some silver stickers and light bluish grey pieces represent the effect of painting having scraped off over time, with surprising accuracy. Attention to detail, proportions, correct shaping and colour placement are all strong in this model. Moreover, the speeder included in the set doubles as a display stand, so the ship can be posed in a flying position without using extra pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Two rather special&nbsp;minifigures are included in this set. While the Mandalorian has been seen before, I appreciate this minifigure for its great amount of detailing. This design features arm printing and silver decorations all around, aside from the&nbsp;helmet, unfortunately. Boba Fett, as seen in the Mandalorian show, is the star of the set, though. He comes with arm printing as well. The decorations on his torso and legs flow smoothly and fit together. His clean armour and black garment make for an&nbsp;unique colour combination. Also, the head printing was a pleasant surprise, especially since the skin tone matches the one introduced with&nbsp;75280&nbsp;501st Legion Clone Troopers. If you count the carbonite block as a figure, then it must be noted that its design, while using a sticker, reflects the original Han Solo in carbonite:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0984/han-solo-in-carbonite-(brick-1-x-2-x-5)"">SW0984</a>, so that is a nice tribute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is better than one might expect. While the minifigures included are amazing and certainly a highlight, the build must not be ignored. There is almost nothing more I could have asked for from a ship of this size, especially considering the fact that it can be displayed in a flying position. The only thing that could have been added would have been the ability to deploy&nbsp;a seismic charge, since this type of bomb has made a reappearance in The Mandalorian. But, all in all,&nbsp;this&nbsp;ship is packed with play features and details alike, so it is a great set suitable for all kinds of LEGO Star Wars fans.</p>

"npapag","2022-05-10T16:36:08.2Z","Size does not matter","<p>75312 Boba Fett&#39;s Starship (we do not call it Slave-1 anymore!) is between 75243 (20th Anniversary Edition, also owned) and the one from 75222 (Betrayal at Cloud City, a beloved set of mine). It achieves an unusual (for Lego) balance between scale and detail, as other reviewers noticed. It has definitely exceeded my expectations: it is attractive and the figures are impressive. Boba Fett undoubtedly stands out because of its printed arms (first time appearance here, although now in other sets too). The current price (EUR50), although it seems expensive due to its mid-size,&nbsp;is justified due to its quality and the figures included,&nbsp;It&#39;s worth both as a toy and as a collection; I ended up offering it to my older son.</p>

"Alucard_Tepes","2022-06-20T15:51:35.557Z","75312-1: Boba Fett's Starship","<p>Regardless of the name change,I&#39;m still going to call it Slave I. This was a set that I was excited for when I heard about it. I wanted Slave I for a while now, but I missed the pass ones, plus they were expensive. So when this came, I had to get it (though at a later time). Building experience was okay, had trouble with the long bottom part of the ship where the guns are at because some parts together were very easy to fall apart, along with it being in a small, odd space. It has some neat looking parts, but they did a good job downsizing it. For figures, Mando isn&#39;t special but a great figure, he also has his beskar spear which is neat. I really like the Boba Fett. The arm printing is very sleek and looks nice. Really love his head, and the new tan skin tone makes it a thousand times better. Now I know people weren&#39;t happy with the helmet and jetpack being sand green instead of dark green like the torso, but I honestly don&#39;t care for it, I&#39;m just happy we got the&nbsp;Mando version of&nbsp;Boba.&nbsp;Very&nbsp;playable! There is a hook you can hold, making it very versatile to move the ship around. There are also stud shooters, the wings move a bit and the guns at the bottom are adjustable. The little vehicle thing does help for display, but I enjoy having ship facing up like how it looks landing.&nbsp;There&#39;s also a little storage area that can hold the carbonite brick, and the design of the sticker is neat. However, I kinda wish they made a little dispenser for seismic charges, that would have been cool. But overall&nbsp;I&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely worth the $50. I know it&#39;s not the best Slave I we have and some may not like due to being inferior to the UCS version, but I really like it. Definitely recommend if you missed out on the previous versions. Hopefully we&#39;ll get one of Jango Fett soon.</p>
