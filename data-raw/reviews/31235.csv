<p>Pros...</p>

<p>- The best thing is that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;minifig scale &amp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes with a decent amount of figs</p>

<p>- Lots of new techniques and parts will definitely keep you immersed into the build</p>

<p>- The legs are very cool overall, especially how the lego screwdriver works with it</p>

<p>- The price may seem inflated, but I would have to say it fits the pieces &amp; figs included</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>- The last box of the 4 boxes was incredibly frustrating.&nbsp; Too many small&nbsp;parts trying to hold large parts of the exterior and it makes the shell of the body &amp;&nbsp;front of the head&nbsp;VERY fragile.</p>

<p>- due to the fragile nature of the exterior, the playability is extremely limited, so I wouldnt recommend it as a playset</p>

<p>- I would have liked one minifig that was exclusive to the set, but that&#39;s just a minor gripe tbh</p>

<p>Overall, the build was a lot of fun and I spread it out over a few days time and enjoyed it.&nbsp; If youre building for display purposes, it definitely works as a beautiful centerpiece for an at-at display or just as part of a ucs display.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bit expensive as mentioned, but worth the money if you&#39;re into star wars and especially ucs sets</p>

"AcidSurprise","2021-12-18T04:37:51.897Z","UCS AT-AT","<p>First, let me start by saying that this set is amazing. The amount of details that they put into it is astounding. Let&#39;s get into the review shall we?</p>

<p>Starting off with the pros: It looks amazing when it is built, it&#39;s a must-have for any collection, or for any Original Trilogy fan. The build process is awesome from start to finish, especially when you see how the Lego team was able to incorporate different techniques in the build.</p>

<p>Now onto the cons: The build does take a long, and I mean a long time. I built mine over the course of a week. Some of the techniques that they used are kind of finicky. For example, there are 4 pieces that are built and attached to the sides on a 1-stud connector, and they seem to fall off very easily. Another problem that I have experienced is, that the legs have out on my set after a few weeks. I had moved it once or twice to dust it and after about 3 weeks, I woke up to find that it had collapsed on itself. So far, I&#39;m unsure if it was due to an error during the build that I made or if it was a connection in one of the knee joints that gave out. One of the knees didn&#39;t like to lock into place and I think that it is where the fault was.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this set is a beautiful piece to have. Whether you&#39;re a Lego or Star Wars fan, it is a must-have for your collection. My overall rating is 9.5/10. I think that it is worth the price for it and that you will enjoy your UCS AT-AT.</p>

"scnut","2022-02-08T19:53:18.947Z","Solid 4 1/2 stars","<p>This is a really cool set. This is my first UCS set and I am not disappointed at all. It was a really fun and challenging build since I have very limited Technic experience. Mini-figs are cool, I wish there were more but hey, 8 is pretty nice. I&#39;ve ended up buying some battle packs and some Storm Troopers from my local Lego shop so I now have 29 snowtroopers and 4 scout troopers, as well as 6 snow speeders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I guess my only real gripe with this set is that it is really fragile. The armor feels like ir is barely on and rely&#39;s on gravity to stay in place, so moving it can be a challenge. It&#39;s definitely not a set to play with, it&#39;s made for display, which is fine in my case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legs are easy to pose, set seems to be to scale. Interior is nicely detailed. All in all, a fabulous set.</p>

"The_Brick_Collector","2022-02-03T01:20:52.277Z","They made my favorite vehicle into a UCS set - Iâ€™m NOT disappointed!","<p>Ever since I first got into Lego and Star Wars around 2012, I&#39;ve always wanted to see a UCS model of the AT-AT walker, and nine years later they finally delivered.</p>

<p>Let me get the cons out of the way first to make room for the plenty of pros this set has:</p>

<p>There are a few tan plates on the side panels&nbsp;that are visible towards the top of the walker. (NOT on the outside layer, but two plates deep. Only can be seen from the side.) Under the feet there are white plates, which aren&#39;t visible unless you pose one of the legs as if it were in the process of lifting up.&nbsp;These aren&#39;t major issues, and it seems like an easy fix them&nbsp;if you would like to do so. If&nbsp;you care about parts being the wrong color, this is something to take into consideration. Then again, it doesn&#39;t look that bad and isn&#39;t very noticeable at a glance.&nbsp;This is really the only part of the set that is an odd color from the outside.</p>

<p>The price. $800.&nbsp;Price per piece here isn&#39;t as bad as sets like the Star Destroyer, but it is the same price as the UCS Falcon which has about 800&nbsp;more pieces. The general rule for Lego Star Wars is one US dollar for every ten parts, and this set is a little pricer than it should be when going by that rule. Also, regardless of any PPP ratios, this is a very expensive set by itself, and you should only purchase it if you can absolutely afford it. I should also mention that this isn&#39;t a playset, it&#39;s a quality display model. If you&#39;re looking for an AT-AT for a younger fan, I recommend the smaller playset version released in 2020 which is much cheaper. If this is for a serious adult collector however, this model is far superior. Personally, I think the amount of pros&nbsp;in this set justifies the price, which I will get to later.</p>

<p>The panels - This is where I start nitpicking, lol. The panels on the sides and top are not locked in with any studs or technic pins, but rather they rest on technic axles through technic holes in the panels, so they are held down by gravity. This may be an issue on my particular model, but the left panel there is a flap towards the back that opens outward, revealing the speeder storage. On my model, this specific flap doesn&#39;t like to stay perfectly shut. If the model is bumped, the panel will move slightly outward, but not much. Maybe a couple centimeters. There are opening doors within each panel as well that are used for easy access to the interior. On this same panel, the door (which is opened upward) begins to slowly tilt back down after opening. None of these issues appear on the right side.&nbsp;The speeders that are placed in the back are difficult to get locked onto their respective stud as well, and around this area there is a plate that acts as part of a&nbsp;ceiling for the first floor. Pushing up on this plate will dislodge it slightly, and while it can be forced into place again by using a brick separator to wedge it, this isn&#39;t fun to do. At all. Luckily if you don&#39;t press that ceiling piece at all, it will not come loose, and this also doesn&#39;t affect the structure of the set whatsoever.</p>

<p>The overall build is very interesting with all the different techniques used,&nbsp;yet also repetitive at times. Specifically the legs, but it&#39;s very rewarding once they are finished, and then placed onto the body.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let me get into the overwhelming&nbsp;positives of this set.</p>

<p>Size, Accuracy, and Detail&nbsp;- It&#39;s absolutely massive, and the pictures you see definitely don&#39;t do the model justice. Not only is it big, but it&#39;s minifigure scale.&nbsp;This basically means that if you were shrunk down to the size of a Lego minifigure, the set itself would be the same size as it is depicted in the Star Wars universe. Put even simpler - the model is very accurate. The legs, panels, head, and even the underside of the AT-AT are all very detailed. Generally, Lego ignores the undersides of models and leaves them bare, even for UCS sets, however with the AT-AT they managed to add detail to the belly of it.</p>

<p>Functionality and Structure&nbsp;- Honestly, I&#39;m very surprised that they managed to make the legs pose-able considering the sheer size and weight of the set. The&nbsp;designers did an absolutely stellar job of making the legs very secure/stable&nbsp;while also allowing for different poses with the legs. They do not bend on their own, but rather the set comes with a buildable screwdriver tool that can be used to twist axles in each of the joints. When twisting these axles, the joint will slowly turn due to a gear mechanism on the inside. This might seem like an annoyance, but it&#39;s actually interesting to use, and this was necessary to make the legs move. Freely turning joins would inevitably make the model collapse under its own weight. The designers did a fantastic job with designing this feature. The feet have a rubber Lego tire&nbsp;on the underside of each foot which is used&nbsp;for grip.&nbsp;The rest of the structure uses technic liftarms and has a very solid skeleton, while also allowing for plenty of room on the inside. Towards the front, there is also a piece you can turn to make the neck and head sway back and forth. The head has two pose-able side cannons, and two cannons on the chin that actually slide back and forth to resemble firing, as seen in the Battle of Hoth scene.</p>

<p>Interior -&nbsp;The side and top panels can be removed to reveal the skeleton and interior of the AT-AT, which can accurately hold 40 minifigures or troopers - and then some. The set itself comes with only 5 Snowtroopers, so if you want to fill the AT-AT completely, you may need to buy some of new Snowtrooper&nbsp;Battle Packs&nbsp;to do so. There&nbsp;are 40 seats, but the vehicle could realistically hold much more than that if some figures were standing inside. There is a place in the back to hold four Imperial&nbsp;snow speeders, and the set gives you two of them already. The engines and rest of the interior&nbsp;are nicely detailed, and there&#39;s&nbsp;a very open space in the center to&nbsp;store E-Web&nbsp;cannons or other figures. The head of the AT-AT opens with a hinge that can be pulled up on to reveal a detailed cockpit with space for two AT-AT Pilots, and of course General Veers. The set comes with these figures as well. Luke Skywalker is also included, which can be attached to a rope under the AT-AT to recreate the iconic scene where he took down a walker using only a detonator.</p>

<p>In closing, this is quite easily my favorite UCS model, if not my favorite set ever. It&#39;s definitely the most accurate UCS model with near perfect scaling, an entirely accurate interior based on the Star Wars vehicle cross-section books from a while back, an incredibly designed structure that can hold its own weight and still be posed, and a very detailed outside as well. If you can get past the minor issues I initially mentioned, the pros severely outweigh the cons and&nbsp;this is an easy buy for any fan of Star Wars, or even Lego in general. Very proud to own it, kudos to the talented designers!</p>

"74madfrogs","2022-02-10T05:25:40.047Z","Just not quite worth the high price tag for several reasons","<p>I have been wishing for the minifig scale AT-AT for a long time. I own the original system scale&nbsp;4483, which was one of the best first version of any&nbsp;Star Wars sets, in my personal opinion. But, that set has its flaws - most notably the floppy head panels on the side. I recently added 75288 to my AT-AT army and was getting hopeful that LEGO learned some tricks&nbsp;after seeing a vast improvement in the head design and overall body sturdiness. So, when I learned of the minifig version coming out, I was extremely excited. Soon after the set arrived at my door, the issues started to surface.</p>

<p><strong>Quality control</strong>:&nbsp;Shortly after working through box 1&#39;s packs, the excitement started dying. LEGO included an incorrect piece. I&#39;ve been building LEGO for about 35 years now. Never has there been a screw-up. I pushed through because it was a superficial piece and awaited&nbsp;LEGO to send me a replacement. I then came across another incorrect piece and then 2 pieces that were completely missing. I don&#39;t know if I got through one box without an error. LEGO sent me 2 replacements and then stopped accepted the systematic request after the 2nd request. I didn&#39;t want to use up any more time trying to call or chat with customer service, or wait a long time to receive the replacements,&nbsp;so I swiped the last 2 pieces from other sets in storage. 3 of the 4 pieces were required for progressing so that knocks my rating down a bit. Hopefully LEGO fixed the issues in their 2nd production run.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong>: There is no way I can ever&nbsp;determine how many LEGO sets I have built in my life. I will say this one had me screwing-up more than any other, which is a good thing for me. I mean, if it didn&#39;t, it would be a boring build. I feel like even the most repetitive steps, like building the feet, didn&#39;t feel torturous. Even despite the 4 pieces that fell under quality control&#39;s radar, this was one of the most enjoyable builds I have done.</p>

<p><strong>Structural stability</strong>: <strong><em>HEAD</em></strong>&nbsp;My floppy head gripe with 4483 is sort of surfacing with this set. Then, when I try to get the side panels on the head to lay in as much as possible, a chunk of the side jaw falls off and bounces across the tile. The design is just not tight enough.&nbsp;The last gripe about the head is the weak connection point&nbsp;of 2x2 round plates holding the massive side cannons in place. I have had them fall off on me. <strong><em>BODY</em></strong>&nbsp;The front portion of the side body skirts that are between front and back legs kept falling off because of the flimsy securing by 1x3 tiles. I ended up bolstering the connections with an additional plate on each of them. I&#39;ll see how well that works. It is also difficult to remove the body side panels without getting hung up on some other portion that ends up falling off. Rehanging the side panels isn&#39;t user-friendly, either. As for the overall side panels, a clip and bar securing system does not suffice for the weight of each portion. I&#39;ve had a portion fall off if I didn&#39;t handle the panel delicately enough. I would have just expected a tighter and more structurally sound design. That being said, it is displayed on top of a 7&#39; tall china cabinet. I have been able to put it up there and take it down several times with no issues. It tends to be at random times that things fall off, like when repositioning&nbsp;parts or removing panelling.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong>: Yes, every part of this set is accessible, which is awesome, but then you end up with a skeleton. It has seats for 40 troopers but you can&#39;t even see them without stripping the thing down. The two hanger doors open to nothing. You can flip open the head&nbsp;but it doesn&#39;t seem to stay open on its own so one hand has to keep it propped open. I guess if this were to be played with, one side&#39;s panelling could be removed so the other will still look like an AT-AT.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong>: Really??? The only upgrades are&nbsp;dual moulded legs on General Veers and a Snowtrooper Commander torso. I guess all the minifigs have pretty well been refined over prior sets so maybe that is the best they could do. But, it would have been kinda cool to at least have had 2&nbsp;of the&nbsp;new Hoth Biker Scouts to man the controls of the speeder bikes to give us more newness to the set and more minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: From a distance and not touching it, especially the head once the side panels are as good as they can be situated, I will say this is an awesome set. It does have some great detailing, even including&nbsp;a&nbsp;ladder and the generous use of tiles in the interior. However, I sort of regret buying it because I truly don&#39;t feel the end product deserves an $800 price tag, especially being the owner of 75192. It&#39;s more $700 or $650. With that said, though, I don&#39;t ever plan on getting rid of this. I would recommend it to others but would also share my observations.</p>
