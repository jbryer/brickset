<p>The Bad Batch Attack Shuttle was my most anticipated set of the summer, as I have been enjoying the show. The minifigs in particular, were very exciting to me, and now having the set in hand, the minifigs are good, however not perfect.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with Hunter, who in my opinion is the best minifigure in this set. There really isn&#39;t anything I would have improved. The leg and torso printing are exceptional, and the helmet is perfect as well. Some people were complaining about his choice of a hairpiece, although I personally think it captures his look. He has two separate face prints, an angry expression which looks perfect, and a more stern look which I don&#39;t really think captures his face. Overall though, this figure is near perfect.</p>

<p>Next I&#39;ll talk about Wrecker. Wrecker is another really great figure and is again, nearly perfect. He uses the same torso and leg prints as Hunter (which works fine), however he also come with a shoulder attachment that is trying to imitate a larger size and height. Although this does its job, his helmet which is a reuse of&nbsp;the Iron Man helmet in gun metal grey, is a shorter mould than the standard clone helmet making him still look the same height as everyone else which isn&#39;t ideal. The face print is perfect, however.&nbsp;Still though, Wrecker is another great Minifigure.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crosshair is an interesting Minifigure to say the least. He of course comes equipped with his imperial armor, and although I and many others would have preferred his standard republic armor, I don&#39;t mind too much. All prints are good however I feel that more dark grey should have been incorporated into the armor rather than straight black. I also feel that a new (or at least different) helmet mould should have been used as the standard P2 clone helmet is less than ideal. His face print is great however I do feel some sort of hairpiece should have been included. Even still,&nbsp;this figure is&nbsp;passable.</p>

<p>Tech is where my opinions on the figures&nbsp;starts to change a little. Now as always, Tech has great prints on the torso and legs, and even comes with a backpack which I really appreciate. Now this is all great, however it&#39;s hard to appreciate it when the helmet is such a glaring issue. The size of it is absolutely ridiculous. I understand LEGO wanted to implement the feature where you can actually see Tech&#39;s eyes/goggles through the helmet which is lore accurate, however the way it implemented looks very odd. Taking the helmet off, tech has a great face print and an okay hairpiece. I personally use the one from the resistance officer in the 2016 resistance Battle Pack either way it&#39;s fine. Overall, Tech is great, but if LEGO ever redesigns Tech&#39;s helmet, I hope they just make the goggles part of the mould.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Echo, who is... interesting. I&#39;ll start with the good things, I really like the arm printing on his right arm, and it doesn&#39;t both me that his screwdriver bit wasn&#39;t included. The printing is all around good, and the face print is fantastic,&nbsp;but that&#39;s about it. The helmet should have been a new mould, the Kama shouldn&#39;t have been printed, and a backpack would have been nice. Echo is definitely my least favorite figure of the set.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also nice to mention that Gonky was included here, but he is the wrong color, although I don&#39;t fault LEGO for that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>This set has a few really nice parts, with a printed cockpit piece and a large selection of sand blue parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>There are three main builds of this set, being the 2 speeders and the Shuttle itself.</p>

<p>Crosshair&#39;s imperial BARC speeder is very similar to the 501st Legion Clone Trooper&#39;s speeder although with some noticeable differences. The design I&#39;d say is better than its 501st counterpart, although a large amount of stickers has to be applied for extra detailing. However, it is still oversized and isn&#39;t a perfect build.</p>

<p>The Lime speeder is definitely the best&nbsp;of the 2 speeders although still isn&#39;t perfect. It is still slightly oversized, but that isn&#39;t really a problem. I don&#39;t really think it makes much sense to put it in this set, but I&#39;m not complaining. However, this does kill any chance of getting a Pantora speeder chase set based on episode 4 of the Bad Batch which is fine by me as I would much rather see something else from the show.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bad Batch Shuttle itself (The Havoc Marauder) is a really great build. I don&#39;t mind the color choice of Sand Blue, the build is really sturdy, and it is very detailed. It has a pair of spring-loaded shooters located on the underside of the vessel which I recommend taking out as they have a tendency to accidentally fire when you are picking up the ship. Speaking of picking it up, don&#39;t try to pick it up from the top fin as that will result in the top opening up to reveal a small interior. The interior as stated previously is small and fairly cramped, however it has enough room to put all four of the batch inside. It also has a small storage compartment in the back of the ship for storing weapons and accessories. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied with the build.</p>

<p>Play:</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t really &ldquo;play&rdquo; with LEGO any more, it&#39;s hard to form an opinion in this section. However, from previous experiences, I could 100% see a child enjoying this.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is an exceptional set with only a few draw backs, and if you&#39;re a fan of the show, this is a must-buy!</p>

"KnightOfRen","2021-08-06T03:53:22.74Z","Incredible set with only minor flaws","<p><strong>LEGO Star Wars Set 75314: The Bad Batch Attack Shuttle</strong></p>

<p>This set is truly wonderful, and exceeded my expectations by a long shot. The build was very fun, the minifigs are incredible, and there are some really cool and fun parts included. Read on to find out more...</p>

<p><strong><em>Spoilers for &ldquo;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&rdquo;: Episode 1 &ldquo;Aftermath&rdquo; ahead. Proceed at your own risk.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with Tech. Tech has a brand-new helmet mould that has never been used on any other characters before now. This piece has insane detail both in the shaping and the printing. As for the figure itself, the detail carries into the face, body, and legs. Tech also comes equipped with two very detailed blaster pistols, and a printed backpack. Tech has printed goggles, but sadly the visor on his helmet cannot be brought down.</p>

<p>Next up is Wrecker. He has a new armour piece for his chest, with detailed printing and two studs on the back, if you wanted to give him a proper backpack. His helmet is the newer, one-piece Iron Man helmet with a unique print. While it isn&#39;t entirely successful, it gets the point across. Wrecker has a detailed face print showing scarring and stubble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now we move onto Hunter. He has the same torso/legs as Wrecker, but it works fine. He uses the standard Phase II Clone helmet, with a unique print. This helmet is shared with Echo and Crosshair as well. He has a detailed face print with tattoos and a bandanna.&nbsp; Hunter also comes equipped with a knife, which is included on a sprue with one other.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Echo. Echo has the same helmet mould as Hunter, but underneath he has a completely unique head with cybernetics replicated, as well as a different skin tone to distinguish him from his brothers. Echo also has a highly detailed arm print, with a representation of his screwdriver arm. However, it falls apart at the hand, rather than including a screwdriver hand LEGO included a plain light grey one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s&nbsp;Gonky. Gonky is the best minifig in the set because Gonk. Case closed.</p>

<p>Final minifig is Crosshair. Crosshair is in his Imperial armour, and has a black helmet with a green visor. Under the helmet there is a detailed face print with a crosshair symbol. Other than that, the figure has a nicely detailed torso with a backpack and belt.</p>

<p>But, one thing is missing. Where&#39;s Omega? She is a core character in the series, and she isn&#39;t included, nor does she have a spot in the shuttle were they to produce her in another set.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>First we&#39;ll begin with the speeders. Crosshair&#39;s is a recoloured BARC Speeder from 75280 501st Legion Clone Troopers, with some slight changes. I think this colour scheme fits his character well, however.</p>

<p>Next is the lime green speeder. In Episode 4, Hunter steals this speeder from a vendor on Pantora. I like this speeder, it is small, but it does its job well and has lots of nice details. The vibrant colours also draw plenty of attention.</p>

<p>Now, onto the shuttle. Bag 2&nbsp;builds the cockpit, Bag 3&nbsp;builds the body, Bags 4 and 5 build the wings, Bag 6 builds the side panels and interior details, and Bag 7 builds the canopy and roof. It was very fun to assemble, and I stumbled upon some cool parts in cool colours along the way. The cockpit has a printed console and room for two minifigs. The rear holds two more figures, and has posters decorating the sides. There is also a small crate for spare weapons and accessories.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a turret in the rear. As for playability, you CANNOT pick this up from the dorsal fin, unlike most convential LEGO shuttles. Instead, you must put a few fingers underneath, and the others around the upper fuselage. However, too much pressure on the bottoms of the engines will cause the entire side panels to detach. This is a large problem with playability, so if you want to swoosh this, be cautious.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>This set costs $100 US Dollars at retail. With 900+ pieces and 3 builds, one of them very large, on paper this is a good value. I must say, I feel like I got my money&#39;s worth here. There is a lot of good value here.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This is a wonderful set, with only minor flaws. If you are a fan of The Bad Batch, I&#39;d highly recommend you pick this up. You will not regret it.</p>

"Scott1","2021-08-13T22:40:50.583Z","A Great Set With Only Very Minor Flaws","<p>The Havoc Marauder is the Bad Batch&#39;s ship that they use for personal transportation. To date, this is the only Lego Bad Batch set. In that regard, it&#39;s an excellent set. It is amazing that they&nbsp;ditched the &quot;Knights of Ren&quot; style of making these named armor-clad&nbsp;characters. In this set, you&#39;ll get all 4&nbsp;members of the Bad Batch, plus Crosshair. You won&#39;t need to buy 2-3 other $80-$100 sets just to get the whole group. Though the speeders are trivial, the Marauder itself&nbsp;looks decent enough that their inclusions don&#39;t detract from the rest of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box features the Bad Batch in the upper right hand corner, carrying with the theme of basing that design off of&nbsp;specific shows/movies, rather than a singular design for the whole year. The instructions are of the new binding that appeared a few years ago, which is much better than the old way, which would fray and disintegrate&nbsp;very easily and very quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Lego has made the choice to depict the Marauder in sand blue rather than gray, and I personally think it looks great. It&#39;s accurate to the show, and blue non-Separatist&nbsp;ships are few and far between in Lego Star Wars. I also really like the stickers used inside the ship; they add nice detail. And the printed cockpit piece is great too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigs in this set are&nbsp;excellent, though there are a few minor issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hunter is the leader of the Batch, and his minifig is amazing. His helmet looks great, especially since it fits with all the other new style of clone helmets. The helmet itself isn&#39;t too big or too small, and the same can be said about the printing. His face printing is accurate, and his included hairpiece looks accurate as well.&nbsp;The only problem with Hunter is that his backpack is not included, which is a common theme in this set. Fortunately, it isn&#39;t too hard to make one yourself, or you can simply leave him as is, since it isn&#39;t that big of a deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wrecker is the guy the Batch goes to when they want to blow something up, or need brute strength. As a result, he&#39;s physically bigger than the rest of the Batch in the show, something that the minifigure accurately portrays. His armor looks great, and the use of an Iron Man helmet looks&nbsp;surprisingly good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tech is the brains of the Bad Batch, and his minifig also looks outstanding. His new helmet mould looks accurate, though it is ever so slightly oversized. Unlike the rest of the Batch, he strangely enough DOES have a backpack. His armor is medium stone&nbsp;gray rather than pearl dark gray, and I think this does a good enough job of conveying that Tech&#39;s armor is lighter than the rest of the group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Echo has been one of&nbsp;my personal favorite clone troopers since he first appeared in The Clone Wars in 2008, and it feels so wonderful to finally have a minifigure of him. That said, I think he&nbsp;is the weakest minifig&nbsp;in the set, for two reasons. First... <strong>no cloth kama for Echo?&nbsp;Aargh!</strong></p>

<p>They made one for the Phase 2 Captain Rex, and for an ARC trooper in 2012! Why couldn&#39;t they do one here? And the second reason is that his right hand is supposed to be a cybernetic apparatus for connecting into droid ports. Instead, they simply gave him a different colored hand. Even so, he&#39;s still a decent minifig, especially with his superb arm printing, but he has the most flaws out of the bunch.</p>

<p>Crosshair is given his black proto-Death Trooper armor rather than his pre-Order 66 gray armor. I think he looks great; the green in his visor looks amazing when contrasted with the black helmet. No backpack again unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>This set consists of three main builds; the Marauder itself, and then two speeders. The black BARC speeder is almost identical to the one in the 501st Battle Pack, just with a different colour scheme. Personally I&#39;d rather they&#39;d have&nbsp;left this speeder out, and instead chose to beef up the shuttle. Crosshair doesn&#39;t use a BARC speeder in the show, and so the only reason why Lego probably included this was just for play value. That&#39;s a fair compromise I suppose, especially since leaving out the speeder probably would have also meant leaving out Crosshair for a future set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lime green speeder is some type of civilian model, and of the two speeders, this one is the one that makes the most sense to include the set. I would still rather have a beefed up Marauder, but it&#39;s not like the speeder is bad or anything. It&#39;s a pretty neat design actually, especially in the lime green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The star attraction of this set would be of course the Havoc Marauder. I think it looks outstanding; very striking, especially in the sand blue. The front of the ship is nice and sleek, and it has enough room to actually hold all four of the Batch, unlike the Knights of Ren transport.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playability</strong></h3>

<p>Because of the inclusion of the two speeders, this set has a lot of play value. The only problem is the way the Marauder opens up; the set (visually at least) practically&nbsp;<em>begs</em>&nbsp;to be picked up by the big&nbsp;center&nbsp;wing. If you do that, you&#39;ll open up the rest of the ship, and the lower portion will hang to the ground. To actually &quot;fly&quot; the ship, or even hold it up in any capacity, you have to hold by either the two wings, or by the fuselage. Once you realize that, it shouldn&#39;t be problematic, but it can lead to a bad experience if you aren&#39;t careful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>

<p>For $100, this set is a pretty good value. The ship is decently sized, and can hold all four members, plus you get Crosshair. It&#39;s not a steal or anything, but it&#39;s really fairly priced. This is definitely a set that you can get at full price and still not feel ripped off.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Overall</b></h3>

<p>I think this is a great set. You get all 4 members of the Batch, plus Crosshair, a really sleek looking ship, and two speeders, though the speeders are give or take for me personally. The minifigs are all of top-notch quality, even in spite of their flaws.&nbsp;If you&#39;re a young fan of the Bad Batch show, or you&#39;ve been watching&nbsp;the Clone Wars since it came out on CN way back in &#39;08,&nbsp;this would make for a fine addition to your collection.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2023-01-04T16:28:22.423Z","Clone Force 99","<p>This set is very good and only has a few flaws. The speeder bikes are great, but I would have rather seen those pieces go towards making the body of the ship bigger and perhaps making the bikes another set together. Some people say the colour of the ship is incorrect, but it is close enough and was probably based upon source material alone. There are some very cool sticker details on the inside of the ship and the print for the cockpit is great. All the members of the Bad Batch are great, although it would have been nice for Echo to get a more accurate robot arm. The access to the interior of the ship is not latched down in anyway so grabbing it by the fin will break the ship and I wish it was secured down. The way they want you to grab it is right by the spring-loaded shooters which you might bump and cause to misfire. The look of the ship is very sleek and very clean. If you are a fan of the Bad Batch in anyway I highly suggest picking this set up.</p>

"Torrent_Studios","2023-02-16T11:24:28.933Z","Does the Marauder need an update?","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>This review will contain <em><strong>spoilers</strong></em> for <em>Season 1</em> of <em>The Bad Batch</em>, but will be largely&nbsp;<em><strong>spoiler-free for Season 2</strong></em>.</p>

<p>With <em>The Bad Batch</em>&#39;s Season 2 just past the halfway mark, I thought it would a good idea to take a look at <strong>75314 The Bad Batch Attack Shuttle</strong> - the LEGO set depiction of Clone Force 99&#39;s means of transportation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The box is quite large. As with larger LEGO sets, there is a simple resealable latch on the side flaps that allow for easy storage. The box art displays the <em>Havoc Marauder</em> in action, soaring above the surface of a desert planet. On the ground, Tech pilots a&nbsp;green civillian speeder bike, while Crosshair pursues his former ally on an Imperial BARC speeder.</p>

<p><strong>Contents and build process</strong></p>

<p>Inside the box are eight bags, numbered from 1 to 7 (there are two bags numbered 1). The perfect-bound instruction manual is packaged in a separate tight-fitting pocket, along with the sticker sheet. The minifigures are spread across the bags, spicing up the building experience.</p>

<p>I built this set over the course of about 3 hours at a leisurely pace, taking short breaks in between bags.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The members of Clone Force 99 are immortalised in this set as LEGO minifigures, represented as they appear at the end of the Season 1 premiere.</p>

<p><strong>Hunter</strong> is suited up in his <em>Katarn</em>-class commando&nbsp;armor, coloured in gunmetal gray. He has two detailed expressions on a suitable medium-nougat head:&nbsp;neutral but serious on one side, gritted teeth on the other. He is armed with a dark bluish gray bowie knife. As of this review, Hunter is the only minifigure not exclusive to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Tech</strong> sports&nbsp;an exclusive mould for his helmet, which features dual-moulding and excellent printed/moulded detail, even if it is a bit oversized. To be fair, that is an issue with a lot of Star Wars minifigures (due to the minifigures&#39; proportional differences to human beings and such).</p>

<p>Underneath this helmet, you will find two expressions: one with green goggles and a focused expression, and one without goggles and looking slightly skeptical. I don&#39;t recall seeing Tech without his goggles in the show, though the latter expression could prove useful for generic clone troopers.</p>

<p>I like the light bluish gray colour scheme, even though I would have preferred white. In the show, his armor is off-white, but not quite gray. Tech is the only Batcher with a simple brick-built backpack assembly, featuring a then-new printed 1x1 tile. (it was later used for control panels in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75331-1/The-Razor-Crest"">75331 The Razor Crest</a>.) Tech is armed with two <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6103643/submachine-gun-%C3%B83-2-shaft"">boxy blaster pistols</a> to represent his DC-17 hand blasters.</p>

<p><strong>Echo </strong>is the most disappointing minifigure in this set, personally. His cybernetic left arm is represented with only a printed arm, with no special hand attachment, only featuring a standard light bluish gray hand.&nbsp;The printing on his left arm is a little jarring, considering that none of the Batch have printed arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His kama, a defining feature of ARC troopers, has also been simplified to printing on the front of the legs. I would have much preferred the fabric element LEGO used to use. Echo has a light nougat head (appropriately pale compared to his squadmates)&nbsp;with a slightly tired frown. Printed on the reverse is his wraparound cybernetic implant, except it doesn&#39;t go too far around the head. I don&#39;t understand this, because LEGO has perfected a similar design with Lobot, whose minifigure looks great.</p>

<p>He is&nbsp;equipped with a standard LEGO Star Wars blaster pistol, which is also puzzling. In the show, he obviously uses the same DC-17&#39;s as Tech, and LEGO had already included accurate-looking pistols for Tech.</p>

<p><strong>Wrecker</strong> has&nbsp;the exact same torso and legs as Hunter, but with the addition of a large armour element that includes some accurate printed Clone Force 99 insignias.&nbsp;There are two studs on the back of this element and I think Wrecker could have used a backpack as well.</p>

<p>His medium nougat head has some stubble and one good eye, the other one surrounded by nasty-looking battle scars. Wrecker reuses the one-piece Iron Man helmet; while it is an alright decision,&nbsp;I think a new mould would have been better. He is equipped with a double-barrelled&nbsp;Space Police blaster.</p>

<p><strong>Crosshair</strong> looks suitably menacing in his Imperial proto-Death Trooper armor, and he is equipped with a standard long blaster. His medium nougat head has one fittingly serious expression and I like the &#39;crosshair&#39; tattoo around&nbsp;his right eye. Crosshair&#39;s helmet has an accurate green visor that evokes Death Troopers, although this element cannot allow for a rangefinder attachment.</p>

<p>The all-black Death Trooper-esque armor is accurate for the majority of the Bad Batch show, but I think a lot of people wanted the Republic version of Crosshair.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have <strong>Gonky</strong>. He is Gonky.</p>

<p>One last thing about the minifigures: I think Hunter, Crosshair and Echo could have used one&nbsp;new helmet mould, as their helmets look quite similar and a new mould could represent them all. Also, this new mould could accommodate Crosshair&#39;s rangefinder.</p>

<p><strong>The completed models</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, we have&nbsp;the two speeder bikes.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;civillian bike has some attractive lime green livery, and has a sleek design. I believe this bike is based off of the one Hunter grabs off a civillian on Pantora to rescue Omega from Fennec Shand.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;bike can accomodate one minfigure, although grabbing the handlebars is tricky. The <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4644102/handlebar-w-3-2-shaft-bar-ends"">element used</a> was designed for LEGO Friends&#39; minidolls, not standard minifigures, and attaching both hands onto them will require a bit of &quot;illegal&quot; action, stretching a minifigure&#39;s arms out of their sockets slightly. Without a minifigure riding it though, it looks&nbsp;good.</p>

<p>Crosshair&#39;s Imperial BARC speeder is almost exactly a recoloured version of the Republic speeder in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75280-1/501st-Legion-Clone-Troopers"">75280 501st Legion&nbsp;Clone Troopers</a>. Like its Republic counterpart, this&nbsp;bike does look too large next to a minifigure, but I like the design, especially the simple brick-built handlebars. There is a&nbsp;dark blue seat&nbsp;that looks quite comfortable for Crosshair. Clips at the back can store Crosshair&#39;s rifle.</p>

<p>On to the <em><strong>Havoc Marauder</strong></em>. The predominantly sand blue colour scheme has attracted&nbsp;debate,&nbsp;but I think it looks great, and certainly better than how light bluish gray would, in terms of a playset.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, I will&nbsp;mention that this set has a fatal flaw that severely affects playability. The designer of this set has made it so that an entire section of the top of the ship can be hinged upward for easy interior access. Conceptually it was an amazing idea, but aside from the hinges,&nbsp;there is quite literally nothing attaching the top to the rest of the <em>Marauder</em>. If you picked up the ship by its dorsal fin, the rest of it would just snap downwards.</p>

<p>Simple modifications are available, however, as I found that replacing a couple of tiles above the cockpit will generate enough clutch power, so as to allow for the ship to picked up by the fin. I&#39;m still unsure about swooshing it,&nbsp;though.</p>

<p>In the cockpit, there is space for two minifigures to sit, one in front of the other. There is sufficient space in the front seat to accommodate even Tech with his large backpack attached. Hunter can sit behind him, and in the passenger compartment, Echo can sit facing Wrecker. There isn&#39;t much space though, and fitting all the minifigures in feels cramped. Gonky cannot fit after the four Batchers are inside, either.</p>

<p>Located where the door to the cockpit would be, there is a crate with a hinged cover assembly above it, providing&nbsp;space to store&nbsp;the Bad Batch&#39;s weapons. Removing the entire assembly will create some extra space to fit Gonky. I like the large&nbsp;sand blue cockpit cover, printed with two red windows which contrast quite nicely with the sand blue. A dark bluish gray 2x2 tile is present on the left of the ship, representing the <em>Marauder</em>&#39;s boarding ramp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dark bluish gray elements are scattered throughout the hull, replicating the weathering on the shuttle&nbsp;as seen onscreen. Most of&nbsp;the hull is utilised for Technic assemblies, securely attaching the wings on either side. Folding these wings up and down is satisfying, and it can achieve accurate angles. A single sand blue stripe runs down the length of each wing, neatly integrated between the black wedges. Most of the top of the hull is tiled off and the result is very satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the wings are fully folded up in landing mode, however, unsightly light bluish gray Technic elements are made visible. This was probably done for ease of construction, and the gray pieces could be substituted for black elements instead.</p>

<p>The rear of the <em>Marauder</em> looks just as great as the front, with a red tile portraying the tail gunner&#39;s window. The two tail guns below the window are&nbsp;neatly flanked by light blue thrusters, and there are flaps above and below these thrusters which could cover up the thrust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dorsal fin looks visually similar to the wings, but one side has anti-studs. I am not bothered by this, although some people will be. This fin is very securely built onto the top hatch of the ship.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned, the official design does not allow for the ship to be lifted by the fin which detracts from playability. I like that Crosshair and his BARC speeder are included for some opposition, and that the green civillian bike is included for Crosshair to pursue.</p>

<p>Aside from the issue with the dorsal fin, I find the<em>&nbsp;Marauder</em> decently swooshable. It is also fun to fit all of Clone Force 99&#39;s heroes into the ship.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>As the Bad Batch&#39;s&nbsp;main transport, the <em>Havoc Marauder</em> should appear regularly in future seasons of the show&nbsp;(that is, if it doesn&#39;t get <em>Razor Crest</em>-ed, of course). As such, I predict that this set will appreciate in value, like most LEGO Star Wars sets.</p>

<p>Minus Omega, the entire main cast of <em>The Bad Batch</em> can be found in this set, which is great for collectors, and these minifigures undoubtedly contribute to the price.</p>

<p>For the price of $150 AUD, I think there is value to be found in this set, and at a 20% discount or more&nbsp;I would not hesitate to recommend this set to fans of <em>The Bad Batch</em>, although seeing as this set has been retired, a new and sealed copy should cost a lot more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you found this review informative and helpful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been some negative reviews upon this set since it cane out. I personally don&#39;t think this set deserves it. I would like to see some of the people who were up in arms about anti-studs try and build a Moc and make it look as good as this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Review:</strong></p>

<p>This set has 969 pieces, five minifigs, and four are exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>When built the pieces have made a rather large (but still mid scale to the minifigs) representation of the famous Havoc Marauder, two speeder bikes, and a Gonk Droid (best part of the set right there)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>The main build is superb, and quite hefty. When the wings are folded up it looks quite small. But if you fold the wings straight out like a passenger plane the wingspan is impressive! The build is sturdy, and it has few small pieces that break off when played with. Its shape is streamlined, and the angular shapes and sides help even more to give it the look of a futuristic starship.</p>

<p>The wings are on hinges, but they are not weak. The hinges keep the wings up very well, and while they inevitably wiggle some, they do not fall down.</p>

<p>The middle fin is connected very sturdily (it took some effort to attach it) And it doesn&#39;t look half bad for such a simple connection. The anti-studs on the right side were a big con for some people but the designer put a lot of thought into making the designs the same as the other side, and it looks fine.</p>

<p>The rear of the ship was not forgotten, including some of the best details on the ship. The sublight engines are on the back (looking very good) using shields to create a sort of turbine housing are very clever, and there is even a small representation of the rear guard cannons.</p>

<p>For the interior of the ship (Cockpit and Hull) there isn&#39;t much to say. The cockpit is not insanely detailed, but it fits two of the bad batch, so thats something. The main hull has room for 2 bad batch members to sit across from one another, and there is a hinged crate and some computer pieces for detail. (The moniters display the words &quot;Space battles&quot; and &quot;History.&quot;)</p>

<p>The Minifigures are superb. Here are each of them.</p>

<p>Hunter, looks great with his tattooed face and red and grey helmet. The hair piece included could have been updated instead to the old luke hair piece in black like the Loki fig, But the Snape piece works fine. The detailing on the legs and torso is good, as well as the two knives that are included.</p>

<p>Wrecker, Looks even better. His shoulder pads work amazingly well to suggest his size, and the blaster piece included to represent the DC-17 interchangable weapons system works well. The helmet is perfect for his onscreen shape, and the prints are vivid even though its white on dark grey.</p>

<p>Tech, Looks... good on the most part (see cons section) His armor consists of a lighter color which is accurate to the source material, and his constructed backpacke looks great. His face print is good with one side portraying with goggles and the other without.</p>

<p>Echo, is also good, though I think he would have looked better with the robot arm attachment instead of just the print. His prints are good, with the signature red and grey, and his face print matches the mechanical detailing from the show.</p>

<p>Crosshair, oh crosshair. I am a little disappointed by crosshair. They made him his Death Trooper varient instead of classic. But other than that his printing is also good, with his signature eye tattoo of a crosshair.</p>

<p>Pros about the speeder bikes are granted, hard to find, as they were most likely included as filler to reach the price point. The green speeder has never been built before, and the techniques to build it are...clever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Its hard to find many cons in this set to be honest, but here are a few.</p>

<p>As it is a smaller ship not a ucs it does not have a Whole lot of interior spacing, and while it is possible to fit 2 minifigs in both quarters, it is not easy. It takes some messing around to fit all their gear in the proper spots.</p>

<p>The cockpit piece does hinge back to allow access, but the whole middle section comes up as well, making play a little more complicated.</p>

<p>Barc speeder is a disappointment. I dont understand what LEGOs deal is with these barc speeders. They are double the size they should be, and they are also a direct copy of the 501st battle pack speeders.</p>

<p>Tech&#39;s helmet is way to big, it drops way below his neck down to his torso.</p>

<p>None of the bad batch other then tech and maybe wrecker include a backpack, which doesn&#39;t really work as they all have one in the show.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>This Set, while it has some cons, is an awesome set to introduce the bad batch. Its size and shape is appealing, and the Gonk droid is phenomenal. I would really suggest heading to your nearest lego store or department store to buy this before it retires on Jan. 1st. As it will be your last chance to do so. The price will most likely skyrocket because of the exclusive figs.</p>
