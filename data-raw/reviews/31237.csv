The exterior is quite attractive, but the action features are minimal (I wish it had something for the development of a Dark Trooper instead of the Tie Fighter). At the same time, the presence of a single Dark Trooper figure falls short of our expectation (thank God for the Dark Troopers Attack set). Moff Gideon and Fennec Shand are very loyal in design, In such regards and a price at EUR160, it is a rather expensive gift, but not for the uncompromising fan of The Mandalorian!</p>
