You really needed another pirate to complete the story here but including 3 minifigs with a set this size is still nice. I didn't like it nearly as much as the larger Saber Island but it did make a nice defensive addition to the soldier's base I built using pieces from Saber Island and other sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T15:38:30Z","Great...","Maybe the red (english) soldiers didn't have the same level ( i prefer much more the blue) this set is really an old-school lego set...you fin anymore a set like that...

a big plus are the white walls (corners) with the wind effect (they're WHITE!!) so it's the contrary of those included in eldorado fortress etc.

so, when you're making english-french wars, this is a must for your english base ;) (for the corners obviuosly)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-26T15:38:54.373Z","The Cannon cove","This set is a set of the pirates theme and was released in the year of 1993. Like all the other pirates sets of this size, this is good designed and also builted. I like the minifigures, also good but also simple designed. This set includes three minifigures, a pirate and two soldiers, no new things, but still nice. The boat of the pirate is very simple, but very useful for sets like this. The set have a medium size, not much big, but in a good size to make a simple cove with a cannon and a part of a wall. The pieces that makes the cove part are in a gray color scheme to looks like stones, and due to the building, the small gray pieces looks like really a lego cove. In the size of the cove, there is a white and yellow building, looks liking a wall of defense of the soldier. This part of the set not have much texture and the building is easy, but combined with the cove, it makes a great effect. Upper, there is a part of a tower and a flag, sometimes, in sets like this, really useful. The cannon, that is a feature, is inside the wall and works correctly, another cool effect. The green plate that is under the coveis not much big but it is in a good size for the set. The playability is basic, and the building alongside with the design still good. Altough this set uses some old pieces and have no new features, all pieces are useful and in overall this is a good option for all lego fans. So, i rate the &quot;Cannon Cove&quot; 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"salahadin","2009-10-16T04:23:08.2Z","Fire!","Cannon cove is one of my most favourite imperial sets ever. For this set I´ll use words: small, but imaginative fulfilment! 

I like loophole for cannon (especially yellow bricks form interesting component)
Secret chamber in the rock (brig maybe)
Red boat with a lanyard (yeah, it´s detail, but I´ve never seen it otherwhere)
Green baseplate (it´s rare I think) forms bigger colorfulness
Redcoats (I love them more then bluecoats)

Verdict: There is no minus, 6266 is faultless!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"James83","2021-09-04T17:05:11.937Z","Hidden Prison Hidden Gem","<p>I loved the little fort sets in the Pirate theme and this was no exception, plus it had a cannon and a secret compartment. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>

<p>The set is built on a 8x24 green baseplate (maybe a yellow baseplate would have looked cooler) and looks deceptively like a bigger set. The set comes as two spaces, the mountain brick and the main fort with its gun.</p>

<p>The mountain brick looks good from the front, even with the additional white brick elements to form the support for the cell door. Today I guess these would have been grey bricks but the effect still looks OK. The rock is perhaps the best concealed prison conceived in the pirate sets. The door is unique, a hefty brick-built affair with sloped bricks and antenna poles as bars within an arch. The whole thing is hinged with a Technic figure ski pole attached with horizontal clip bricks and stood on a stud brick. The top of the ski pole is also used to mount a short flagpole with a printed Imperial flag.&nbsp;I can&#39;t think of another Lego set of this era that uses this hinge method, but it works surprisingly well despite how flimsy it looks. The inside of the cell is not big however but a minifig just about fits inside if sitting down.</p>

<p>The building is built up of attractive white and yellow bricks with corner wall pieces and a large arched opening for the cannon in yellow which features four stud bricks as attractive columns. The end wall features a yellow train window which looks perfect for a fort like this.&nbsp;Even the wall butting onto the rock brick has a nice arch brick at the top. The roof is surmounted with a 4x8 castle turret top brick which also looks very good. The only I&#39;m not a fan of is the two-level roof, but the inclusion of a ladder is a nice touch (this lifts easily to aid player access to the cannon). This is perhaps the best looking smaller imperial soldiers fortification of that era. Inside the room there are two clip bricks for stowing rifles or cutlasses. A bush outside completes the tropical look.</p>

<p>The fort is armed with one cannon on wheels and comes with six black stud bricks as ammunition.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>An Imperial solider with blue epaulettes and backpack and an Imperial officer, both in the revised 1992 red colours. They are armed with one flintlock rifle, a flintlock pistol and a cutlass.</p>

<p>One pirate minifig with black legs, red and black striped vest torso, pirate head with stubble and eyepatch with a red bandanna. Comes equipped with a flintlock pistol.</p>

<p>The pirate comes with a red row boat with two oars.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I think this is one of the best looking fort sets thanks to its nice details and care taken when Lego selected the bricks. It offers an interesting build and fits in well with any other Imperial sets you may own. I did very little to this set because the building was so perfect, although I didn&#39;t really use the prison cell as such. But this is a fun set with a nice combination of 3 minifigs, a cannon and a boat which allowed you lots of scope for play.</p>
