At first glance, you may assume that it&#39;s just Spinjitzu Burst Cole and nothing else worth getting this one for. But there is something very small hidden in this small foil pack that might make it a must-buy.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>This&nbsp;foil pack is the new version introduced in 2020, which is easier to open than the previous one. On the front you can see an action shot of Cole with his oversized drills. There is nothing interesting on the back.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>The building process is incredibly simple, since it&#39;s only a normal minifigure and a couple of small parts. The instructions are in the magazine and are easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I would actually say that the parts are the best thing about this set. Besides the pieces that make up the minifigure, we get two big golden cones, two small transparent orange cones, two golden drills and two incredibly fascinating pieces. In this small magazine gift, there are TWO&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-4"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-25893"">25893</a>&nbsp;(3.2 Shaft W/ Knob) in black, which have only appeared in the&nbsp;$229.99&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71374-1/Nintendo-Entertainment-System"">71374:&nbsp;Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. If you don&#39;t want to spend almost 230 dollars to get these two small parts, this is the best and only way to get them.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Spinjitzu Burst Cole is pretty standard. He has some very nice details on his torso and head. I especially love the dragon face on his back and his eyes bursting with energy (pun completely intended).&nbsp;The only things that some people may not like are&nbsp;the lack of an&nbsp;alternate face print and the reuse of Legacy Cole&#39;s Legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, Burst Cole is good, but he isn&#39;t incredible. He also comes in the&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-3"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70685-1/Spinjitzu-Burst-Cole"">70685-1</a>&nbsp;Spinjitzu Burst Cole set.</p>

<p>As for accessories, I really don&#39;t like these. The drills are very oversized and it&#39;s almost impossible for Cole to stand up properly while holding them.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s just one minifig, so it doesn&#39;t really deliver a lot in terms of play value.&nbsp;However, there are some puzzles and games in the magazine that this comes with.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In the end, should you get this magazine gift? Absolutely! Even if you already have Burst Cole from the spinner set, the incredibly rare parts are enough to pick this one up. And if you don&#39;t have him, this is a very cheap and easy way to get this version of Cole. I&nbsp;highly recommend this set!&nbsp;</p>
