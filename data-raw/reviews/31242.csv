<p>The minifigure is quite exceptional, coming with exclusive torso and face prints as well as a hard to find leg set. The plane is wonderful to look at, but I don&#39;t recommend it for&nbsp;play. Most of the connection points are a bit weak causing it to fall apart fairly easily. The stand&#39;s design makes it look like a memorial,&nbsp;however I would have liked to see the plane held up more realistically.&nbsp;There are also many stickers which make it a lot like a model kit.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is very beautifully and authentically created. I really love this set and I recommend it for older fans of Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this review was helpful!</p>

<p>The set&nbsp;is unusual as there&#39;s lots of upside-down building and pieces I&#39;ve never seen before, which was great to build. It took me about an hour.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is definitely a display piece and not really for playing with, as there is nowhere for Amelia to sit in the plane.</p>

<p>It will look good in my lounge as it will match the decor !&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried to review the set on Lego.com product feedback but it wouldn&#39;t let me - possibly because it is a FREE set, and therefore very good value for no money !&nbsp;</p>
