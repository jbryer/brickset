<p>This set is part of the new pets BrickHeadz line. It comes with 186 pieces and is recommended for ages 8+ and is set number 40442.</p>

<h2><strong>Builds</strong></h2>

<p>This set comes with 3 builds, they are the stand, the goldfish, and the fry. You can easily take off the fish from the stand, or keep them on display on the stand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Stand</h3>

<p>The stand has a boarder of dark azure plates and tiles, and&nbsp;the inside of the stand is black. On the back of the stand there are some seaweed pieces on the left and right, and in the middle there is a coral piece. The fish are on some 2x2 clear bricks. On the front of the stand is a piece&nbsp;with a sticker that has some bubbles. There is also another piece with a sticker that I believe you are supposed to use to replace the one with the bubbles if you want.</p>

<h3>Goldfish</h3>

<p>.The goldfish has those classic BrickHeadz eyes. It has the mouth in the middle and on the top it has his scales that are trans-orange and not regular orange like the other pieces. On the left and right there are its fins. On the top is another fin, and on the back of the fish there is the big fin that I think can pop off pretty easily, so keep that in mind if you are getting this set.</p>

<h3>Fry</h3>

<p>The fry is pretty similar to the goldfish, but there are a few major differences. The mouth is made out of a jumper plate this time, and the fins on the left and right are made out of a cheese slope and not a 1x2 slope like the other fish. The tail is only different because it is attached using a 1x3 jumper plate. This tail can also come off relatively easily as well.</p>

<h2><strong>My opinions/conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>Overall I&#39;d give this set a 4/5. It&#39;s&nbsp;a good set, but I wish it had more detail in either the fish or the stand. I would recommend this set to anyone who likes fish and LEGO (like me).</p>
