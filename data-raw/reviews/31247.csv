This is very well put together and an excellent offering from 2021, one of the easier to come by sets as Creator Polybags tend to hang around longer compared to Minifigure based builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Engaging and impressive build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Fun looking models, Chick particularly stands out as a unique offering and an excellent seasonal display.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Hatched Egg model repetitive and simple to build making for a quick and easy bit of fun to have each Easter.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Chick model does not attach to Hatched Egg model base making it easy for one to fall out and hit the floor when moving models around a display.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Hatched Egg model lacks seasonal colours, plain white elements should have included some prints to add a bit more seasonal look to the set.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m a fan of small sets like this, they offer more to build and display and grant the opportunity to enhance a display whenever decorations are put up for the holidays. They also make for a decent offering as a substitute for candy during the holidays to avoid overindulging on sweets. This LEGO set works perfectly as a fun toy and a fun present to receive during the holiday. Highly Recommended.</p>
