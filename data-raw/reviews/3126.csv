"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-24T15:48:47Z","6268 Renegade Runner","For those people who couldn't afford the larger pirate ships like the Black Seas Barracuda, the Renegade Runner makes a nice little substitute.  (As an interesting sidenote most pirates actually used smaller ships such as this one.  Man-O-Wars like the Skulls Eye Schooner were used by the British fleets instead.)  

It comes with a nice sail that just screams &quot;Pirate&quot; with the Jolly Roger emblazoned on the black and white stripes.  The actual ship is brown and utilizes a thinner hull than most of the other ships.  While some may feel it is underarmed with only one cannon, at least it has a swivel to allow it to attack from any angle.  It also has one of the best figureheads available - a red dragon!  It also comes with several pirate figures - but none that you haven't seen a hundred times before.

So if it is such a great ship, why not give it a &quot;10&quot;?  There are a couple of glaring things that were missing.  The ship has no steering wheel or anchor - pieces that Lego could have very well put in without affecting the price very much.  I also think the ship looks &quot;rushed&quot; from the back end - no windows or anything except a red piece and the flag pole.

In the end, I feel that the Renegade Runner is a decent ship.  Its low price is probably its saving grace, because it allows people without $100 to still have a pirate ship.  While it may not be the most &quot;playable&quot; ship that Lego created, I think that it displays well and creates some variety on the shelf.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-26T11:23:22Z","Sweet","﻿I think I was four, almost five when I got this set for Christmas.  I got this because my parents thought it was insane to spend
more than $100 on a LEGO set that I’d probably lose half the parts to before I was ten(Skull’s
Eye Schooner).  They were probably right.  I remember I loved this set!  I played with it all the
time.  My dad even made a little flat-bottomed boat with pieces from my already-growing LEGO
collection that the English could chase the pirates in(I was young, and it never occurred to me
that motor boats weren’t invented then).  I really wish I could have this set again.  I lost the sails,
masts, flag, compass, string, and dragon figurehead.  I mean lost.  I will never find these pieces.  I
don’t have them any more.  And I always seem to lose the e-bay auctions.  

The reason I chase this set so much is because it’s such a great set.  I love that it’s fore-and-aft
rigged.  The only LEGO boat ever to be fore-and-aft rigged, I think.  It’s a perfect pirate boat, but
I do have my complaints.  I wish the sails were a little less obvious.  I mean, even if they were
island-hopping and ambushing boats, it would be obvious.  The first part of a boat you see is a
sail(there comes the cry “sail, ho!”).  And if the sail you see had a big skull and crossbones, do
you think you’re going to stick around?

The matter of the wheel and anchor doesn’t matter too much to me.  I’ve sailed in a sloop about
this size, and it didn’t have an anchor.  Boats like this probably would just tie up at the nearest
dock or cove, they wouldn’t have to drop anchor.  Plus, a boat the size of the Renegade Runner
probably wouldn’t have a wheel, it would have a tiller.  If you just customize it so that a lance
connects to the rudder and goes through to the decks, which isn’t that hard to do, then it looks
OK.  But if you really want a wheel, buy the 6250 and use the wheel from that set.

The set has a wonderfully “Pirate” feel to it.  Small sloop with a crew of three and a captain.  I jus
wonder if the captain is supposed to be Red Beard or something like Red Beard’s Quarter-Master
who inherited a ship they caught.

This is, overall, a wonderful boat.  I rate it very highly because of the realism and just how much
fun it is to play with!  Because it’s a small sloop, not a huge frigate like the Black Seas Barracuda
or a galleon like the Red Beard Runner, it is easier to maneuver, fast, and just fun!  You’ll see
what I mean if you get this set, I’d say it’s just as fun as the Black Seas Barracuda, but not quite
as good-looking!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-28T14:27:44Z","Great small ship!","    This is a small ship but still a very good one.  When I was building it I was shocked to see that the hulls are very thin, these are same that are used by the Imperial Flagship.  The rigging is very nice, but here comes my usual complaint: pirates can be a bit cocky, but with a giant jolly roger on the sails, this is guy is gonna get creamed if he has to run up the main sail.  It doesn't matter not having an anchor, sloops like this wouldn't need it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
4 pirates!
Loads of guns
A ships hull thats very usefull
A compass and map
A cannon

Cons
Not much space to stand your pirates

Overall a great set for any collector",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2007-08-21T15:31:12.46Z","Good affordable ship","What a great idea to bring out this smaller ship alongside the monstrous SES. Many parents (including mine) couldn't or wouldn't buy one of the larger pirate vessels, so there was clearly a niche for the Renegade Runner.

The set might not seem too impressive. It is merely a hull with sails. But I can't help to love this little fellow! The crew is awesome, with Ironhook - one of the later pirate torso designs I actually like - as captain and no less than three other pirates. The dragon figurehead is nice, as is the compass, and the ship also comes with two pirate flags. And although the design is not very substantial, I think the ship does look pretty smooth and ... frightening! The blue pieces are a bit out of place in my opinion, but can of course be replaced by black ones.

Nowadays, I use the Renegade Runner for my army of skeleton pirates. I might upgrade their ship to a SES one day, but I love the RR so much it would almost feel like betrayal...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"SimonStickfish","2008-09-11T12:53:27.717Z","Nice Renegade Runner","I just acquired this set. It's not a very big set, and it lacks a nice wooden steering wheel. Besides that, the aft section isn't all that great. There are no animals what so ever, no monkey, no shark, not even a parrot. But when you think of it, this set is to go to sea, and there would be no room for a floating animal farm anyway. A shark would have been nice though, and a small plank would be awesome.

But besides that, the sails are nice, and it is armed to the teeth. The single cannon doesn't look much, but it's nicely balanced to the compact size of the ship. It contains a captain, a steering man and two regular pirates. There are plenty of weapons, every single figure is armed. There's also a treasure, but that's quite common in most sets.

It's a nice and relatively cheap addition to the gigantic 6285 and 6286-sets, you can get hold of one for not so much money. The bigger 6285 and 6286 are very expensive, if you can't get a hold of one, try this little Renegade Runner! I therefore rank it 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"_obelix_","2008-12-13T09:58:48.153Z","Pirate's armada interceptor","The first and only boat i have in my pirate armada this is a pretty good set to have. It has a 4 minifigs, one captain, one first mate, and two pirates, a canon with round motion for firing in all directions, a good sturdy sail, a compass and many more. This isn't the biggest ship in pirates armada, but it compensates that by being armed to the teeth. It's small in size, or rather compact, but everything seems to be put into place so well on this boat which increases it's playability greatly. Lots of small, neat details are great too and are installed nicely on the boat's exterior. For it's price i say its a good buy for any pirate theme fan, like myself.

"Odeinoichus","2012-01-22T16:49:50.573Z","Sail the Seas Many Birthdays Ago","<p>Set #6268 Renegade Runner: If memory serves me this set was a gift to me for my 9th birthday, a long time ago, almost twenty years. I have chosen then to review this set for my 275th review on Brickset as the Milestone Special. (I try to make my milestone reviews something special. Try being the operative word.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many's a time I've recalled fondly this set, it had been with me for almost the entire twenty years I've lived since then, I say had because roughly five years or so I gave away most of my older bricks and pieces to my cousin. This was amongst the many Pirates items sent to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was my first and only Pirate Ship, unlike others on this site I've never had any Red Beard Runners or Imperial Flagships, so all I have to go on are memories, a picture or two, and nostalgia. That being said the Renegade Runner was a pretty good value back then, it featured a large number of pieces for a set of that size and included four Pirate Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cloth sails were a real treat for me back in the day, sad to say though they didn't last long for a kid playing with LEGO. I strongly suspect they were ripped and torn not more than five weeks after my birthday, I was a rather destructive child in my youth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back at the build for this model now it did have some pretty simple steps, and featured a few tricks, I'll be perfectly honest though in saying I can't recall much about it. All I do remember is it didn't take me long after opening the thing that day to get it put together and sailing alongside my smaller Pirates longboats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures were pretty standard at the time, with simple facial designs and torso prints. A lot of the Pirates Mini-Figures had beards and mustaches of some kind, probably why I liked mixing and matching the heads up so much. This set introduced us to Captain Ironhook, unlike Red Beard his torso fetured a different print, he had the hook for a hand gimmick the same as ol' Red Beard, and also featured the Captain's hat with the jolly roger print on the front. (I've forgotten the technical term for it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I am remembering my sets right these older ships could actually float, but I'm not sure if the Renegade Runner actually had this feature. All I can say for certain is that most of the ship was built using two large halves with a few bricks and plates and things built up over it to make it look more than a bare bones vessel. I especially liked the way the mast worked, with all the string and extra features to simulate proper rigging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I'd have to say that for Pirates fans there are a lot better ships out there. However this little beauty is still deserving of joining your flotilla if only because it featured a unique captian, the only set to include the bare armed hook hand torso as far as I can recall, and also features a much smaller vessel for realistic nautical fun. A small band of renegade Pirates like Ironhook's crew would need a faster ship in order to escape the much larger fleet of vessels commanded by Governor Broadside, or Captain Red Beard. I reccomend this ship to Pirates fans, and hopefully this review isn't too bogged down by nostalgia.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"SirSven7","2012-01-09T21:10:46.05Z","Lego Steve's Review","<span style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"">The Renegade runner, 
seen by many as one of the worst ships, looking at the old ships they 
included important things, like a ships wheel and an anchor, the runner 
sadly misses these finer points in sailing (though they have a compass, 
so they will know if there going in the wrong direction they just cannot
 do anything about it). The mix of blue bricks on the bottom and red on 
the top also doesn’t quite work. <br><br>But I remember this ship being a lot 
cheaper than its counterparts and also though small it is quite 
complete, there is space on deck and the cannon rotates fully which is a
 nice touch. It must be noted that the cost worked out as three of these
 ships compared to one Black Sea Barracuda or Skull Eye’s Schooner, and a
 fleet of three of these looks really nice (especially if you have a 
Schooner or Barracuda following behind).<br><br>&nbsp;In honesty I hated it when I 
first got it, but it grew on me, it’s nice to have a smaller ship and it
 should be noted that this is the only pirate ship that was commanded by
 someone other the Redbeard, that someone was Ironhook(its a shame that 
the second attempt at this really failed).<br><br></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"Slayer89","2014-11-02T13:11:59.953Z","How a pirate's ship should be","<p>Really an awesome pirate&#39;s ship, and, as i wrote on the title, it&#39;s like all the pirate&#39;s ship should be (and how them were in reality): compact, with no extra firepower, higly manoeuvrabile and really well armed.&nbsp; During the golden age of Pirates, the seas were full of this little ship (usually called &quot;sloop&quot;) with just few cannons, a lot of men to drive and board the ship, more helpfull during a battle to pillage bigger (and slower) cargo ship.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set it&#39;s small compared by all the other pirate&#39;s ship, but full of details: a compass, mounted guns, the rotating-cannon...even the little red dragon&#39;s sign on the top of the ship</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>An exceptionally full of minifig&#39;s ship compared to the size, with 4 in the crew (a captain, a first mate and 2 sailors) where others ship (much bigger) has just few more (8 in the black seas barracuda that is twice/third bigger). All of them armed to teeth with cutlass and flintlock.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was a joy when, escaped from my dark age, I restart to build this nice ship (and had to buy few missing parts on bricklink). Not so complicated to build and it will take just 1 and half.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A must for any pirate&#39;s fan, and even compared to the other ship of my collection, it&#39;s still very nice and proud.</p>
