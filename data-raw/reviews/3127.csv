This is a good place to start for any basic building, and I especially would recommend it for water/ocean scenes.  It goes well with tan or yellow baseplates for a beach.

Altogether, pretty normal.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The result of this is that it's quite a struggle to collect enough blue buildingplates to put a stop to the seemingly endless period of low-tide in my harbour area.

In my experience there's quite some demand for this plate because people want to use it with their Pirate-theme lego, or create a recreational lake in their town for speedboats and wind-surfers.

You can even use blue plates as a replacement for the original green buildingplates of castles. When you use ordinary grey, tan or green plates to fill in the inner-court, one can create the effect of a castle-moat surrounding the castle, providing a real purpose for the drawbridge in the process.

These blue plates are far more versatile than they seem to be at first glance and the demand for them proves my point.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>I tape the blue plate onto adjacent green plates to act as the lake in the Harry Potter castle.&nbsp; I usually only have a boat on the lake (the kind that brings the first year students in), and put the rest of the buildings on the green plates.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
