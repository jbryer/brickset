Just recently I put it back together and was amazed about just how simple, but cool it was. The range of minifigs is fine, and the baseplate is very unique. I love the rope bridge, the staircase, the two (yes, two!) jail cell doors, the crow's nest (including a ship's mast), and even the lantern. One of the first and one of the best sets!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-22T04:01:40Z","WICKED!!!!","This set is great and all the features are nice. The baseplate is wicked and the minifigs are great. The stairs go into the water though, but the secret hatch which opens up to the jail is wicked. The crows nest is wicked and the cabin (or whatever it is) is just the right size for a pirate to fit in. The jail is also great and if you get more admirals &amp; imperials you can chuck them in. I really like this set and i got it in a box with other assorted lego pieces and pirate sets. 
Pros: 
* Minifigs
* crows nest and wacth tower
* little cabin
* jail 
* secret hatch which opens into the jail
* cool cannon
cons:
* stairs go into the water

"Cornwell","2008-05-03T20:12:26.81Z","The best pirate kit in existence","A wonderful kit all in all. It came with a couple of pirates, and a poor captured soldier, a shark, a monkey and quite a few weapons.

The ingenuity of it is the crow's nest made from the mast of some ship, and the habberdash, thrown together feeling from it, typical of pirates who doesn't care too much for spending time building things, when thar be ships to be plundered.

The best feature was still the trapdoor leading down into the small prison underneath. 

1. Pose treasure-chest behind the trapdoor.
2. Remove safetypin from trapdoor.
3. Wait for some gullible enemy to fall into the trap. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It has a colorful baseplate, with markings on some of the knobs so construction is very easy in the first phase. The fall-through-floor is great, and the soldier is a nice addition. This set has the awesom crow's nest, made from the base of a mast of a ship. For the rest, it contains a standard brown rowing boat, a treasure chest, a cannon and of course the six holy cannon balls. There's a captain, a steering man and a red headed pirate and the afore mentioned soldier. A monkey, a shark and a parrot make it complete. But I have to agree that the stairs that lead into the water isn't very smart.

"StormSworder","2010-07-13T00:06:32.09Z","Nice treasure island.","<p>I remember the first time I saw Lego Pirates.&nbsp; There was a poster in a shop showing the pirate captain, one of his men and a treasure chest.&nbsp; I was really amazed because they looked like nothing Lego had ever made before.&nbsp; When I saw the first wave of Pirate sets back in 1989 I was awed by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is very much in the tradition of the classic image of pirate strongholds.&nbsp; It all looks very exotic, the whole thing being built on a baseplate with a pre-printed island.&nbsp; There is a rope-bridge, a trap-door leading to a cell, a crow's nest, treasure, a working cannon, tropical vegetation and all manner of little details such as a parrot, monkey, weapons and a palm tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is admittedly a little skimpy compared to the pirate strongholds which followed, and it could have done with a few more pirate minifigs, but overall this is a fantastic set and would make a good introduction to the Lego Pirates range.</p>

"ledaKat","2009-10-19T04:44:43.653Z","I Can Just Taste the History","I just found this set last week, pre-loved but complete, along with its original box and inner and plastic moulded tray and everything. Absolute history, I can just taste it. It is a little damaged in places, the large flag is discoloured and has some chipping and the bridge is kinda bent but this set has been loved and played with for twenty years! That blows my mind, I was only ten when it was made. It is charming and utterly fantastic. 

Its really small, by small I mean not many pieces, but because it is on a large square baseplate and has lots of large pieces it looks really big and tall in size. The minifigs are really great. esp the captain with the wooden leg and hook, the sterotypical pirate captian, he even has a parrot! The shark is a nice touch, I really like lego animals and admire their design. It has inspired me to track down more from the early pirates theme to add to it.

The instructions were completely different to more recent sets, I find they are too easy these days. Each page gives you about 4-5 new pieces and their location, whereas this set was a lot more challenging for the mind because there were heaps of addons all over the whole base each time you turned the page and I consider myself quite a skilled adult builder but I found I had to backtrack a few times because I'd missed something.  Thats what lego is all about though, the challenge of the build.

If you can find it, buy it, especially if you find the original box with front flap and inner. They just dont make boxes like that anymore.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I could not say this one is a favourite though for its odd shape and symmetry and a pool in the middle to make too much water. Just personally I prefer the smaller plates. The pirates get a snappy little brown rowing boat with grey seats and red oars, this is such a simple build that is more of an accessory to the main model and a sword and blunderbuss pistol is thrown in. A grey shark is also welcome to patrol the surf.</div><div><br></div><div>Most of the build is in black bricks or rock if you like that has been carved or utilised to build rigging and a base of piracy on to.&nbsp;Just briefly its worth looking at how much better slants sit at the bottom of stone fort and castle panels than standard one stud bricks to better meld them to the ground, appearing as sturdier foundations.&nbsp;A couple of stronger supportive pieces are used such as tall one piece two stud bricks and the very tall two piece black mast. Clips go straight on the ground for the excellent brown rope rigging to rise up diagonally. The lower structure is other wise a prison and a rocky outcrop with grey brick print and grey diagonal panel, all kind of makeshift in style and designed like a combination of natural rock and man made add-ons. The prison block is strong and with a chunky 'metal' barred door. It gets a hinged hatch for dropping captives in to and the fate of that Naval trooper is immediately pretty obvious. A technic axle and stopper slide in to hole bricks in the prison roof for the action of 'locking' or unlocking the hatch to act as a trap door so now someone can fall through with a push.</div><div><br></div><div>The upper floor gets a broader plated area and is built up again with long one-piece bricks and the panels. Arches style this room well in to an open 'deck' HQ. A smart little lantern sits outside and provides decoration below a rocky plate roof which can be used like an upper deck. From the smaller rocky outcrop the grey staircase piece adjoins right in line with the brown rope bridge section and makes an ascending route to the decks under the mast. The mast's top gets a brown half barrel and plate crow's nest from which to place a lookout. A palm tree, firing cannon with cylinder 'balls', chest of chrome gold coins, monkey and parrot make an excellent improvement to general scene though their placement is totally interchangeable and not necessarily best done by the instructions. Swords and a rifle sit outside and much of the build gets encroaching palm tree growth (the huge leaves) over much of the build creating a more camouflaged and natural location. A large pirate flag sits on a pole by the stairs rather than the more obvious crow's nest and this slightly low key presentation makes more a secret base of the set.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">						</span>Alternative Building</h4><div>Three other types of ramshackle island camp are explored with good outcomes almost on a par with the main model but not as definitive.

This is not incredible but an extremely good land base for your collection. The more land, the better in a way for its appearance is attractive and suitable so more play and interaction is possible. For collectors this helps form an array of islands (an archipelago?) that can be customised to good affect and not only would I bet you could make your own equally good version of this pirate camp with all the set bricks but would highly recommend it. Its just a case of rearranging the sections of rock, infrastructure, trees, rigging etc. Unlike a ship that is a more cemented design for half the model, this at least is very adaptable and is as much a very good Pirates component collection as it is a model.</div></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"Freezdried","2010-01-30T18:40:49.967Z","Fun toy for pirate fans","Let's face it - the real reason behind LEGO Pirates of 1989 was the fact that the mini-figs had personalized faces.  No other LEGO line had that, so if you wanted fun faces, you had to buy Pirate sets.  With this, you certainly get what you paid for.  Four mini-figs (and a monkey!), three of which had unique pirate faces.  That alone made it worth the money, back in 1989.  Of course nowadays, every LEGO mini-fig has a different face, but back when this set came out, it was a brand new thing.  And very, very exciting.

As for the rest of the set, it's only so-so. The shark is fun, and there's a cannon and a boat, which makes the set very playable for the tots.  But the build itself is easy and takes about 15 minutes.  Also, I am perplexed by the black and gray color-scheme of the buildings - the combination of the colors seems haphazard and messy.  It seems like there was no real reasoning behind the placement of colors, and I don't really like the end result.

So if the reason you like LEGO toys is because you like to build stuff, you probably won't get much excitement out of this set.  But if you like LEGO toys because you like to play with little people & stuff, this set is probably as good as any other.  It comes with four, and with lots of accessories for them.  Three of them are pirates, so if you like pirates, you certainly won't be disappointed with this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-08T17:37:17.877Z","Pirates Classic - Forbidden Island","How I remember that Summer, 1989 and me and my Cousin are out in Trailer/Playhouse at our Nana's getting ready to open up the new catalog for the year and see what new sets were coming out. We turned the page and there's Captian Redbeard and a couple other pirates looking through some brushes towards the new Pirate sets.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Lego was no longer just Town, Castle or Space anymore...<br/>&nbsp;<br/>My birthday came later that Summer and I got the Forbidden Island playset.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>This set should truely be considered one of LEGO's classic sets. Pirates marked a clear bold new direction with their sets and themes. Many new elements and pieces were being introduced. Among which are the first Minifigures to have different faces and not just the basic smiley face that's a hallmark of Minifigures. If I am not mistakened, you also have the first of the named minifigures with Captain Redbeard.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Forbidden Island marks a bold new direction in having a very unique baseplate with a printed Island on it and markings on it to help orient where pieces should go when starting to build this set. There are several features crammed into the set such as the stairs, rope bridge and tower with&nbsp;a trap door to the jail. There's a Look Out/Crow's Nest and rope ladders as if part of a shipwreck has been used.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Parrot, Monkey and Shark are all featured as animals in this set. 4 Minifigures (5 if you count the monkey) Captian Redbeard, First Mate (wears a tricorne hat),&nbsp;Swabbie with red shirt and red bandanna hat and Eldorado Soldier. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>There's a little rowboat for the Soldier to either arrive in before capture or to escape in. A Treasure Chest with four gold coins. The cannons of the first wave of Pirates feature a little pull back knob and spring so you can fire cannonballs (1X1 cylindrical black bricks). There's a Palm Tree and big Pirate Flag.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>As the first Pirate Island of it's kind and among the first Four in a new Theme, Forbidden Island can't be beat if you're lucky enough to own one or be able to get your hands on one.

"PeteM","2017-02-19T11:25:32.007Z","Practically Perfect Pirates Part Pack","<p>Released in the vanguard of what was to become an iconic theme, this Pirate land base was the first home for the heroes/villains (depending on which side you swore allegiance to). Unlike other themes where the base was the &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; of the range, for the pirate faction this plays a distinct second fiddle to the same year&rsquo;s majestic 6285 Dark Shark / Black Seas Barracuda (though arguably so do 90% of Lego sets released since!).</p>

<p>The instructions are &lsquo;of their time&rsquo; &ndash; i.e. no piece call outs, multiple parts added all over the model at each step and the black pieces don&rsquo;t appear particularly black a lot of the time. As the viewing angle doesn&rsquo;t change, it does make for some tricky moments later on when some of the smaller pieces are positioned on the top of the two-storey structure to the right of the model. There are pictures of a few alternative model ideas at the end which were intriguing enough for me and brother to try and replicate some as well as create our own, so they did the job &ndash; though even at the time the vertically mounted shark in the last one seemed like an odd choice&hellip;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>At the time the Pirates theme was responsible for a seemingly massive number of new pieces, and this set admirably manages to encompass most of them in quite a limited piece count! Most notable were the mast sections, rope bridge, firing cannon, rowing boat, printed flags, mast rigging, all of the palm tree elements (including a very generous 11 palm fronds), as well the minifigs and their accessories (various gun swords, hats etc), the animals (parrot, monkey and shark) and finally the printed, unnaturally symmetrical &lsquo;large island&rsquo; printed baseplate. There were also a number of wall panel pieces imported from Castle, including a couple printed with an exposed brick wall pattern, a variety of large plates, and finally the fairly standard array of bricks and slopes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This was the arguably where the minifig as a defined character began as Pirates were the first theme to have faces that weren&rsquo;t just the classic Lego smiley (unless you were unlucky enough to be an Imperial soldier). The three pirates are all distinct, different and characterful, from the wonderfully stereotypical Captain Redbeard (wooden leg, hook, and eye patch), to the tricorne-wearing first mate with a blue jacket over a red and white striped top, and the miscellaneous crew member who was essentially treated as the equivalent of a Star Trek redshirt by me and my brother. The lone Imperial soldier is kitted out in his full French Foreign Legion outfit, with backpack, hat and red shoulder epaulettes, and has the standard blue jacket printing. The design and printing on all four are a noticeable step up from those found in the usual Lego themes and even managed to overtake the minifigs from Castle as the best costumed characters!</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward, helped greatly by the first step being a top down view of the baseplate showing where the first ten pieces should be positioned. Once these are in place the rest of the build goes fairly quickly as most of the bulk of the set consists of large pieces. As such there is nothing particularly of note, though it&rsquo;s the first time I remember seeing the pin-release trapdoor which was a simple technique I then used in several of my own models as a child.</p>

<h3>Completed Model and Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The final result looks entirely ramshackle, which I suppose is the point. I think it is intended to look as though a base has been set up in some kind of ruins, but because so much of it consists of large flat pieces, the set ends up looking more unfinished than ruined. The attempt to hide the gaps with foliage isn&rsquo;t entirely successful and it is entirely dwarfed when next to 6285 &ndash; though not unreasonably as scale is often a moveable feast in many Lego sets.</p>

<p>Playability value was mixed as the island seems both a jumble and sparse at the same time. It was difficult to move characters around easily, not helped by some odd design choices which appear to be because of, or in spite of, the limitations in the size of the printing on the baseplate and the parts that have been incorporated. The strangest are the staircase into the sea and the rigging placement, as access to the latter is obscured by a palm frond on one side and leads into the sea on the other. The jail seems awkwardly positioned, and the structure and build seem to work against the printing of the shoreline rather than with it. I do remember that much fun could be had by deliberately weakening the structures and then crashing a ship (either pirate or space) into the island, demolishing most of the buildings in a fairly spectacular fashion, and the quick nature of the build meant that it was easy to rebuild and go again in short order.</p>

<p>Despite a few issues this is still a good set and, most importantly as part of the &lsquo;launch&rsquo; wave at the time, managed to touch on and incorporate all of the things that were to be emblematic of the pirate theme, even though it is often at the expense of a coherent design. It never quite comes together into a satisfactory whole the way that the (admittedly much larger) Imperial fortress does, or indeed the subsequent Pirate base released two years later (6273) which used a raised baseplate to great effect, though the seeds of that design were definitely sowed here. It was a great source of &lsquo;pirate parts&rsquo; at the time, and is worth a look for collectors or those with a nostalgic connection, but I would advise anyone looking for a good dose of vintage piratical goodness to skip this and save up for the Eldorado Fortress or Rock Island Refuge as better examples of land-based pirate sets.</p>
