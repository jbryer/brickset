<p>As always with the 10-year anniversary sets for Ninjago, I bought this one for the Golden Nya. Other than that, there wasn&#39;t much of a draw for this set. The dragon looked fine, but it&#39;s not like I desperately wanted a new Fire Dragon.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The build experience wasn&#39;t anything special, although it used some fun building techniques and the body was fun to construct.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the model is the mix of colors, including dark red, classic red, and bright orange. The colors blend perfectly, although in some angles you can see some blue and green pieces underneath the red and orange exterior.</p>

<p>The most disappointing part of this dragon (I know it&#39;s a wyvern), though, is the stability. Since the dragon has only two legs, it&#39;s hard for it to stand. I can compare this set mostly to the Green Ninja NRG Dragon. However, that dragon, while it had two legs, managed to be stable. The problem with this Fire Dragon is that the feet aren&#39;t rotatable, so the dragon either has to be crouching or standing up straight so that it won&#39;t fall over. It may seem like a trivial issue, but it does get annoying.</p>

<p>Other than that, the dragon is almost perfect. The wings are detailed and made of an incredible cloth material. Everything else works just fine, and I especially like the removable seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Golden Nya is the main draw to this set. She looks incredibly, and is easily one of my favorite Ninjago figures ever. The new hairpiece is quite special, and it&#39;s exclusive as well.</p>

<p>Every other minifigure is absolutely useless. They are all repurposed from other sets. Legacy Kai and Zane look just fine, sadly though, they don&#39;t have their hairpieces. The skeleton is also pretty bland.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison to Original</strong></p>

<p>*Disclaimer: I don&#39;t own the original set, so this comparison will take from pictures*</p>

<p>The original Fire Dragon released about 9 years before this one, so of course it would have some major differences, mainly in the limited array of parts. Additionally, the original Fire Dragon came in the large Fire Temple set. For the purposes of this comparison, I will not be including the temple.</p>

<p>The original dragon is quite simple in comparison to this one. The head on the redesigned dragon looks much better, due to the advancements made in graphic design. The wings are also much better, as the cloth wings look much cooler than the brick-built wings on the original dragon.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the minifigures are much worse in the Legacy version, but this comparison isn&#39;t very fair as the Fire Temple is a much larger set. The Legacy version has a better dragon build, but the Fire Temple is a much better set.</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set costs $50. With 550+ pieces, the price to part ration is just about average. There is some display and play value, but overall the value is just below average. The dragon is a bit fragile and there aren&#39;t&nbsp;any fun play features.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>GOLDEN NYA!!!</li>
	<li>Neat dragon with good parts</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>No fun play features</li>
	<li>Bad minifigure selection (with one exception)</li>
	<li>Fragile and unstable</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>The newest rendition of the Fire Dragon is quite good, even if the set as a whole is disappointing. This is a case where the parts are worth much more than the whole. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this set at all unless you&#39;re trying to get Golden Nya.</p>

Unfortunately, my dreams were dashed away by a design that doesn&#39;t hold up to the price tag. You will find why I think this is such a poor set when you read this.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES: The Kai is a dime a dozen, but he still looks sharp, and I enjoy having an extra fire sword. Zane is disappointing because he has a silver head instead of a yellow one. The golden Nya is what saves this set from being a total disaster. Her hairpiece really sets off this character and the golden robes are the best. She is so detailed, and it&#39;s probably the best golden fig besides golden Wu. I do like that Wyplash was put into a cheaper set, but he has a blue sash instead of a white one. It is very sad to see that he has nothing to fight the ninjas with. Usually you get a small side build for the opposing side.</p>

<p>MODEL: Building the model was okay, but it was the finish product that makes me mad. First, the wings won&#39;t stay up, and it looks terrible in the crawling position. Second the head is too small. Most of the ball joints can&#39;t hold up the model unless you can find the perfect position and don&#39;t breathe on it. The wings also like to fold down into the down position a lot. When on display, it looks incomplete and constantly falls over, so I just boxed it back up and put it into storage. If I was you, I would save up and look for the original.</p>

<p>SUMMARY. I think you get the point. BEWARE!!!!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
