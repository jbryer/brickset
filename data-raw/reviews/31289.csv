<p>Police Officer Harry arrived on the front of Issue 35 of the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; Priced at &pound;4.25 in the UK it was available in early 2021 - no dates were on the comic.&nbsp; Harry comes with a small helicopter build.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>Once again the Lego that you get with the comic comes in a silver foil bag that measures approximately 120x150mm, and is attached to the front of the comic by sticky tape.&nbsp; This limited edition set contains 31 pieces and front image gives us a close up image of Harry piloting the helicopter up in the Lego City skies.</p>

<p>The back of the packet is mostly the standard safety information and copyrights.&nbsp; There is 1:1 image of the Transparent Bright Red Round 1x1 Plate that can just be seen behind Harry in the image on the front on the port side of the aircraft.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Harry is a basic police Minifigure.&nbsp; He is wearing a white helmet with visor and has the aviator glasses that Lego like to use for pilots.&nbsp; His torso is one that Lego have used since 2017, but is still in use for the 2021 police sets, so fits the theme well.&nbsp; However it is not usually an aviation torso, so this makes the Minifigure unique to the set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the torso has Harry wearing a tie, that might not be such a great idea in a helicopter with an open cockpit!&nbsp; It also sports a radio on the belt and on the rear there is the word Police.</p>

<p>His legs are not printed, but the Earth Blue looks good and goes well with the torso.&nbsp; You do not get any accessories to go with Harry, so if he does apprehend a criminal he will have to hold them until back-up arrives.</p>

<p>Harry is made up of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helmet - White Mini Crash Helmet [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4298609/mini-crash-helmet"">4298609</a>]</li>
	<li>Visor - Transparent Brown Mini Visor 2&nbsp;[<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6244785/mini-visor-2"">6244785</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow Mini Head No. 1663 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6112622/mini-head-no-1663"">6112622</a>]</li>
	<li>Torso - Light Royal Blue Mini Upper Part 3627 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6172536/mini-upper-part-no-3627"">6172536</a>]</li>
	<li>Legs - Earth Blue Mini Lower Part [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4162916/mini-lower-part"">4162916</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>It is the eleventh time we have had a police themed set on the comic in 35 issues.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The build here is a little bit of a let down for me.&nbsp; The controls don&#39;t reach the Minifigure hands, like the small aerial&#39;s genrally do on these types of builds, and although I know they are limited with part numbers the central part of the helicopter is basically a 2x2 column with the odd bit protruding.&nbsp; The whole thing sits on a 2x6 plate, with no feet/skids.</p>

<p>Having said that the way the tail is built is nice and they have added a couple of cones using SNOT to give the impression of exhaust ports.&nbsp; The propellors, which are a bit fragile, do the job and rotate freely after a good push and only fall off if hit too hard.&nbsp; One of the 1x6 tiles used for the propellors that I had was slightly discoloured, but this is not too noticeable and only minor.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t say this is my favourite set to be included in the comic line, however it is not the worst.&nbsp; The build is simple enough with a little SNOT building and one good bit of part usage to attach the tail to the body. However, I do feel that it could have been better with the same number of parts.&nbsp; Trying to add a little shape to it would have made a huge improvement and controls/something for it to sit on were required.&nbsp; It feels like something HM Murdock would have thrown together with his mates while stuck in a farm building.</p>

<p>I also think the torso used was wrong and they could have used the Earth Blue ones they normally do for pilots.&nbsp; This is only a minor issue, as it is a police figure and it does the job.</p>

<p>Up next is a small construction set.</p>
