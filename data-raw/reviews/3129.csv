"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-25T11:07:09Z","6271 Imperial Flagship","When I think of &quot;flagship&quot; I usually think of a ship that is the top of the line.  Unfortunately, this ship is not quite there - at least not out of the box.  Although I like the finished product, it does have some errors.

The Imperial Flagship utilizes the thinner hull body used by the Armada ship and Renegade Runner.  Both those ships used one cannon, while the Imperial Flagship is configured for four.  However, you will soon discover that you cannot physically fit four cannons inside without MAJOR reconfiguration.  I think that is why Lego played it safe and only gave you two to start with.  It also has no anchor, which means my soldiers can never dock anywhere.

Once I got past the cannons however, I found that I really like this ship.  The sails are incredibly gorgeous.  They used a tan cloth which really gives it this &quot;antique&quot; look.  The front sail and the side sail really display nicely and stand out from the sails on the other ships.

The steering deck is also very nice, with plenty of hooks for rifles and swords.  The window looking out from the back really adds to the pleasing appearance of the stern.  In addition, the steering wheel allows you to turn the rudder.  However, this little feature prevents you from doing anything with the cabin located below.

This ship really displays well.  It definatlely looks nice on a shelf.  However, I don't think this was the best of the mid-sized ships that Lego put out.  It is missing a lot of the little details that were present in earlier ships like the Caribbean Clipper and Black Seas Barracuda.
It also could use another sailor minifig to round out the crew instead of the extra pirate.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-20T15:52:50Z","The good points outweigh the bad.","Bad points:
1) Too small! an extra mast and middle piece would make it at least comparable to other pirate ships, which tend to be huge.
2) Can't really make use of the cabin below: a real shame.
3) Replace that pirate (i dont think he is that actually- he looks too clean) with another crew member.
4) Could of had a lifeboat at the back.

Good points:
1) Looks absolutely fantastic
2) Brilliant sails (Lost mine, had to reprint them :-( )
3) Nice window, though don't understant what it is there for, they're already in open space.
4) Lots of detail. 
5) Variety of figs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-03T14:06:49Z","Best soldier ship of all time!","This set is amazing! I won this at tradera.com and I love it! It has all the Imperial Soldiers minifigures plus a helm that can turns if you turn the wheel. A set that recommendes for every LEGO collector. Very good!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-10T22:25:43Z","Awesome set. very appropriate","when you really think about it, who's meant to win, the pirates or the stiff Imperial Guards? the system IS called the PIRATE system, right? RIGHT?? there are also more than 2 times the number of pirate sets as Guard sets, combining Spanish, French and British sets. my point? the Guards' flagships aren't supossed to be dominating men-o-war like Skull's Eye Schooner, Black Seas Barricuda and Red Beard Runner. Imperial Flagship is just the right size. 
the sails are gorgeous. the plastic flags have a tan-ish tint to them where there is usually white (supossed to represent air), which is a nice touch. the stringwork is a bit confusing, but not as confusing as the threading in the Imperial Trading Post's trade ship. this set comes with two firing cannons, a rare touch in the British sets (they were around mostly while Governor Broadside still sailed the sea, then grew extinct during the Spanish conquest). also, this set comes with Admiral Woodhouse, a captain, and an Imperial sailor/soldier. however, WHY does the set come with a pirate? and more importantly, WHY doesn't it come with another soldier? and on the front of the box, WHY is there a Pirate helping an Imperial Soldier load treasure on to a freakin' Imperial Boat!? the pirate is asking to be killed. maybe Lego tried to make him look like a pirate, but as soon as i assembled him, i just threw him into my pile of pirates that haven't been placed on a set. i had to incorperate some shockies from my Trading Post to make the boat look more flagshipish. the lack of figures stopped this bodacious boat from a 10/10 rating. also, where's the creature feature? it could at least have a parrot or a shark. however, you probably have enough of those already to incorperate them into your boat's aura. if you don't have any animal buddies, then GET SOME. 
overall, a great set. try to pick it up ASAP, because it rocks. it is one of the 3 Imperial boats, the others being Caribbean Clipper (French) and Armada Flagship (Spanish). this one has less of a top-heavy feel to it than Caribbean Clipper, and looks more natural than Armada Flagship, whose back sail looks a bit out of place, and whose cannon is a bit wierd, although extremely cool. great set, must buy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:05:38Z","Nice flagship, capable of blasting pirates!","     This is a great ship! It has humongous sails, therefore making it a very fast ship! It has canons and is manned by Imperial seamen! It even has some pirate raiders to kill as fishbait! Arrrrrr!  I great ship and if you have a pirate vessel, you can have fights at sea! Great possibilities! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-12T10:35:46Z","I'm in love","I love the baracuda, and the skull eye and all my shippies, but this one is really really really the most beautifull and elegant. I really fell for it when I build it. (I even gave the ship her own personal name) 

it has a small hull size, so it is a really fast ship. I would have removed the Pirate and added an Marine so this ship would be better in fighting off Pirate boarding parties :)


due to the small hull the ship is limited to 2 guns, however that is more then enough for this vessel. the guns are easely turned to the other side of the ship.

the sails... aah yes I don't really like the way Lego has gone with the sails. however these are not that bad. it also has 2 sails on one mast and thy give the ship an elegant and fast look.

the building of this vessel is really fun. it's not to much work (compared to the big vessels) and it is also not that expensive..


Personally I would not classify this as an Flagship, (flagships must be bigger in my opinion) it seems more like an heavy scout, or an escort to me. scouting ahead of the Caribbean Clipper's looking for the Pirate ships, or escorting the merchant ships away from the dangerous waters where pirate's can strike every moment. (and somehow that happens all the time :P)

my advice: Buy buy buy buy!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickmonkey13","2009-04-18T11:10:41.873Z","Protecting the 7 Seas from LEGO Pirates!","I just bought this set off eBay this month and am very impressed with the design of this vintage set. 

THE GOOD:
A sleek design that looks fantastic when placed beside other vintage LEGO Pirate ships of the era. A working wheel that actually moves the rudder! Genius! I'm a sucker for the wonderful canvas sails and any element included in a LEGO set that isn't, strictly speaking, a brick.

THE BAD:
I wish that the LEGO Pirate sets contained some sort of crow's nest - but hey, that's what Bricklink is for, eh?

THE UGLY:
I've always thought that the Admiral Mini-Figure could use a shave.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoImperialSailor","2008-02-15T18:02:24.123Z","An 'A+' set.","This set was my first Lego Pirates set. 
The sails are the most stunning aspect of the entire ship, considering how huge they are.
My favorite part of it is how when you turn the helm the rudder moves, even the mechanism takes up all the room in the cabin. How the rigging is set up is so clever, though it is a rather basic system. I'd have to say the most disappointing part of the whole set is the non-fire cannons, which of coarse can easily be replaced with firing ones. The mini figs are great, considering one of them is an Imperial Soldier. I like how LEGO put a normal sailor in the set, it makes it more realistic. This set gets an A+ from me. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"salahadin","2009-10-15T12:06:41.14Z","""Be careful, pirates!""","It´s very dangerous ship for all pirates, it´s small, but fast and well navigated. Steersman regulates helm of the ship by clever mechanism and at the disposal he has compass. Admiral commands soldiers, it´s rare fig (one of the most beautiful fig ever).

Pros +
Nice sails with sign
Control of the helm
Yellow windows
Compact design
Admiral (it´s beautiful fig)

Cons -
Only 2 cannons (ship is en bloc small)
Only 3 redcoats (in place of sailor-pirate should be another redcoat)

Verdict: Imperial flagship has nice visage and it´s elaborates. I have no exception. Yohoho.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Armada","2010-10-09T12:06:46.4Z","Very good ship Over-all!","<p>This has to be one of the best lego Pirate sets I have ever gotten. I love pretty much everything about it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has some sweet minifigs! 
<li>The rudder function works great! 
<li>Looks really cool over-all</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small, could be bigger. 
<li>Instead of the pirate/sailor and Comadore, You should get 2 more Imperial Guard Soliders.</li></ul>
<p>Over-all, it's a great set and I highly recomend!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"riverson","2011-09-07T08:40:57.933Z","Not as good as I expected","<p>I've been longing for this set since I was a child but never get my hand on one. Recently I found a deal on eBay(complete in good condition with box) and bought it right away. This set is mostly nostalgic for me as I only got the chance to buy the MISB 10210(the second edition) and I really want to see what I've been dreamt of twenty years ago.</p><p><br></p>Now lets get down to some pros and cons.
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great design, easily the best narrow-hull based pirate ship out there<br></li><li>Good color scheme, makes it looks very historical</li><li>Unique Sail pattern with tan color</li><li>Interesting Rigging</li><li>Great minifigs, particularly the governor with white gloves and beautiful white plume on his hat.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The build is not very solid, many connections are weak and the hull sections are very loose until you almost finish the building</li><li>Bad rudder control<br></li><li>Lack of details<br></li><li>No cabin at all(occupied by the rudder control mechanism)</li><li>No figurehead<br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, not a bad set at all, even though it does come with some minor flaws. However it could be addressed easily by making some simple MOCs. Consider it being almost 20-year old, I would still recommend you to buy it if you stumble upon it at a reasonable price. <br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5
"SirSven7","2012-01-09T21:07:44.03Z","Lego Steve's Review","Now we come on to the bigger sets of the year. Here we have the Imperial
 Flagship (the first one that is), something for the Redcoats to sail 
around in. This is the one place where I feel that the Redcoats have the
 edge over there blue counterparts, this ship looks much better than the
 Clipper, it features a better placement of sails with respect to the 
ship as a whole, the rigging for this ship is placed at the side (rather
 than in the middle like the clipper) and the small number of blue 
pieces varies well with the red sails. Where this set falls down is in 
the minifig department, whilst the old clipper had a perfect complement 
of three sailors and one commander, this ship features one pirate (or is
 it a sailor I can’t tell) one soldier (to shot pirates) one officer (to
 boss around the soldier) and one commander (to command).Why did Lego 
not just add three sailors like before, there cannot be much of a 
difference cost wise and it’s a shame because there is not actually 
anyone to sail the ship. Bad move Lego you where so close, still due to 
this fact the clipper has the edge.<br><br><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"LordDunsany","2021-11-12T14:35:18.617Z","Oh, the 10210 is the power in these waters, true enough, but there’s no ship as can match 6271 for speed","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This medium-sized vessel is ironically one of the best LEGO ships for pirating/privateering, as it looks fast, nimble, and well-armed (this is likely the smallest LEGO minifig-scale ship to have proper gunports for the cannons) while also having a shallow draft that would enable it to hide in/flee to shallower waters where larger warships could not follow. &nbsp;Of course, a ship ideal for smugglers and pirates would also be ideal for pirate <i>hunters</i> as they could continue to pursue their prey, and the Royal Navy did use single-masted cutters and sloops to combat privateers as well as for patrolling and raiding duties.&nbsp; The ship uses the narrower 12 stud-wide hull pieces that gives sleeker lines than the more tubby-looking #6274 despite both ships only having a single mid-section hull piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It is a single-masted ship that is unusually rigged with both a large square mainsail and a slightly smaller fore-and-aft gaff-rigged spanker sail in addition to a single triangular forward headsail (while the combination of square and fore-and-aft sails on a single mast does exist, usually any expanded square sails are smaller and above the fore-and-aft mainsail on sloops and are furled/absent directly in front of the fore-and-aft spanker sail on a brig&rsquo;s or ship&#39;s mainmast).&nbsp; These sails are printed on a canvas-like cloth that have a beautiful parchment-like off-white color with the large imperial logo printed one side of the two larger sails.&nbsp; The catalogue photo of this ship is a bit misleading as the spanker sail is turned such that it looks almost parallel to the forward square sail from the angle of the image, leading me to originally think that the ship actually had both forward and rear square sails.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The use of the smaller hull elements, however, leads to some issues I have with the set.&nbsp; The smaller stern element does not allow for the placement of a window in the mostly enclosed area under the stern deck &ndash; the set does have a rear window for appearances but it simply opens onto the already open stern deck (while also leaving an unsightly gap in the deck to accommodate protrusions on the window frame element).&nbsp; The ship has a functional wheel (with a working compass) that actually turns the rudder, a nice feat of engineering that unfortunately occupies much of the space below, precluding its use as a cabin.&nbsp; The narrowness of the ship also means that it cannot accommodate two cannons back-to-back, necessitating the use of smaller brick-built cannons if one wishes to have two cannons on both sides (one could then possibly utilize an additional gunport on the upper stern deck as there are flaps there).&nbsp; I do appreciate the fact that the included cannons have wheeled undercarriages &ndash; the last ones on any LEGO Pirate ships until 2009&rsquo;s #6243. &nbsp;There is some loss of detail compared to the earlier #6274 &ndash; no hatches, no dedicated cannonball storage areas, no figurehead (the front rigging construction precludes simply adding one on without some modifications), and fewer weapons/weapon clips.&nbsp; However, the sails/sail plan and rigging are superior on this ship compared to #6274 (whose single central standing rigging and rear mast lacking sails make little functional sense).&nbsp; I also wish the ship had some small swivel guns like those on the following year&rsquo;s #6268 and #6286, though these are easy enough to add on yourself.&nbsp; The absence of an anchor may have reflected reality as smaller vessels often did not need one as they could be moored or temporarily beached.&nbsp; Although I agree with others that the crew could use another soldier, I do think that the minifig wearing a striped shirt and bandanna is a sailor and not a pirate as he is wearing white pants like the other Imperial guards and could have just removed his tunic (granted, this minifig (and close variants) appears in other sets as a pirate but looks generic enough to be a sailor).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">While this &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; may be outgunned by most of the larger pirate ships such as #6286, in reality, most pirates used smaller, more agile boats such as #6268 rather than the large galleons of popular imagination (three-masted ships like the Queen Anne&rsquo;s Revenge tended to be the exception rather than the rule!).&nbsp; This ship thus makes for a fine pirate-hunting vessel and a worthy addition to the Imperial fleet.</p>

"Space_Police","2023-01-31T11:44:40.04Z","Nice design and a very balanced set","<p>This set offers the perfect balance between detail&nbsp;and playability as all pirate and imperial ships from this era does. I prefer this approach to the juniorization of later retail&nbsp;market ships. This was on of the sets that got me into Lego as a kid and I still like it very much and still have it on display.&nbsp;The ship itself is very well designed and the sails are made out of high quality materials. Sets like this one are what makes Lego such a great product and we need more sets today that have the same design philosophy that both kids and adults can appreciate. The minifigs are some of the best from the theme and with both historical accuracy and that special Lego look in both printing and facial features that modern minifigs seem to be lacking. Modern releases of the pirate theme have failed because they have been too juniorized or special editions with limited availability. Re-release the Imperial Flagship and similar sets or make modern equivalents and they will sell.</p>
