<p>I was sure to get this set once it was revealed, as it contained an exclusive Golden Zane. That was the biggest draw for me, although the build was also a huge hook for me to get this set. The pictures don&#39;t do this set justice, as it is much bigger in person.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>For the first time in a while, I have something interesting to say about a LEGO product&#39;s building experience. This set took me around 2 hours to complete, which isn&#39;t much considering it has over 700 pieces and costs $85. The build isn&#39;t too hard, perhaps something a young adult or even an older child could assemble.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The model itself is sizeable, larger than I expected. The model looks much better when complete instead of when it is separated. The parts all link together surprisingly well, and none of them will come off while playing with this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the bad starts to come in when we separate the model. The double bikes look fine on one side, but the side that is attached to the center part of the model looks terrible. There is only one tiny wheel placed on that side! These bikes look absolutely terrible, although the cockpit looks fine with the gold detail. One small problem is that the cannons can easily pop off.</p>

<p>The helicopter attached is probably the best part of it, as it looks great with the large golden turbines. The cockpit is also good.</p>

<p>The bike is the main section where everything connects. It is MUCH larger than what I expected, but also a bit bare. The section between the small wheel and the cockpit looks empty. The main feature here is that the cockpit and the small wheel can switch spots fairly smoothly. The main problem here is that the bike cannot stand AT ALL. It&#39;s terrible! It topples over all the time. This isn&#39;t too big of a problem but can be quite annoying for display.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, the standout here is Golden Zane. Along with the other golden figures from Ninjago, he looks incredible, this time using an FS hood from Ninjago to great effect.</p>

<p>The four Legacy ninja are included with their golden weapons. These are pretty boring as most people have these guys. Their golden weapons are a good inclusion, though.</p>

<p>The second most exciting minifigure here is the exclusive (for now) Mezmo. The printing quality here is stellar, and I hope he stays exclusive to this set. Rattla is reused from a few other sets, but he looks great here as well.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison to Original</strong></p>

<p>*Disclaimer: I don&#39;t own the original set, so this comparison will take from pictures*</p>

<p>The original set cost $5 less than this one, and I feel that they are pretty evenly matched. The original can only split into the jet and the center part. It can also only hold two ninjas, which is extremely disappointing. Even with these flaws, I think the original still has some great play features, like a holding cell in the back for Spitta and flick-fire missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obviously, the old version didn&#39;t have the new parts like this Legacy version, but it still manages to be a great set. There are a few missed opportunities in this Legacy version, like the lack of weapon holders, but I&#39;d still recommend getting this new Legacy version because it is much cheaper to get nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>At $85, this set provides decent value. The volume, play, and display value are respectable for a set of this value, although the price to part value is a bit lacking. The parts are quite large, but the price may be a bit steep.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>All core ninja included</li>
	<li>Exclusive Golden Zane and Mezmo</li>
	<li>All 4 golden weapons</li>
	<li>Fun splitting play function</li>
	<li>Iconic vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Expensive</li>
	<li>Some ugly builds</li>
	<li>Not very sturdy</li>
	<li>Some common figures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I feel this set is a worthy successor to the original and a good set in general. While I may not recommend it to Ninjago fans, I can certainly recommend it to people who want a nice ninja vehicle or the exclusive Golden Zane.</p>
