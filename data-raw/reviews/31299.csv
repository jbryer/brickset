<br />
We are halfway between a montage of a Star Wars ship from a Speed Champion F1 and of course a machine that only asks to dive into the water.</p>

<p>The assembly is simple with bricks of very beautiful colours and of good quality. A quality that has clearly improved with the addition of the city and consort children&#39;s sets of 2020.</p>

<p>For the game the car drives great, I would have loved to have the rim bearing separate from the wheel bearing which would have given a cool effect.</p>

<p>Side figurine, there we knew better at Ninjago, there are two swimming Ninja (with a great breathing system) and two identical villains.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure my 5-year-old son wakes up tomorrow morning will love to play with it!</p>

"Stormgaming21","2022-01-09T12:20:04.253Z","Review of 71752-1: Ninja Sub Speeder: An Ocean-Faring F1 Racer","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ninjago has constantly provided strange, unique &amp; interesting vehicles since the offset &amp; this Seabound set is certainly no different with an F1 racer design that with a simple transformative feature can easily take to the seas.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The build was a fun &amp; fairly simple event, not too surprising for Ninjago but it does have a few interesting twists and turns thanks to a small but well-done use of Technic parts primarily used in attaching the wheels, spoiler &amp; intakes as well as the front wing but we&rsquo;ll return to that later. The only real annoying part for kids would certainly be the pipe assemblies that rest on the wheels as those are made of very tiny pieces &amp; also the clip-based pipe&rsquo;s that use new for 2021 silver Star-Lord blasters to add a sci-fi air to the car.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The colour scheme of the vehicle being black, silver, gold, bright blue, earth blue &amp; flame yellowish orange does work for a Jay vehicle in Ninjago certainly &amp; on this set is definitely no different. The sticker detail helps but the main gripe with the stickers is that outside of the ones that are used on the intakes every other sticker is placed very close to one another which does feel really tedious especially seeing as all the stickers outside of the intakes are small &amp; thin, it&rsquo;s just not that fun more so if you&rsquo;re a kid, you could leave the stickers off but then it looks plain seeing as there are no prints on the outside of the vehicle &amp; the only print in the entire set is the single printed dial in the canopy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Play-feature wise, you do obviously get an opening canopy to place Jay in his new vehicle &amp; said canopy uses the new gold &amp; clear blue dual-moulded canopy piece that all the Seabound set&rsquo;s make use of. Unfortunately, the cockpit has no studs so the minifig is just held in place by the canopy which is a shame as could&rsquo;ve just changed it to even add two studs to hold the figure securely. Other features include the twin stud shooters mounted to the front wing which are not bad &amp; are a common play feature, however this front wing has more going for it as it&rsquo;s a removeable drone! Which doesn&rsquo;t look all that great, it&rsquo;s kinda blocky &amp; just feels a bit like a last-minute addition but it is a play feature. The final play feature is the main feature of the whole set &amp; it is a very simple transformative feature in that the wheel assemblies are on large action figure/mech suit ratchets for stability which means the front wheels can fold down &amp; the rear wheels can fold back which turns the vehicle into a submersible, you need to stretch your imagination a bit to see it.</p>

<p>For minifigures you get four, two of the ninjas &amp; two Maaray Guard&rsquo;s, the army builder mook of the season, always good figures to get.</p>

<p>The Maaray Guard figures are the exact same as each other &amp; they both look fantastic to me anyway with a combination of black, teal &amp; gold for the shoulder pauldrons &amp; several of the printed details along the torso down to the legs. The teal is used for the secondary colour on the head, the hands &amp; the flippers, a new colour for 2021. Each guard comes with a simple two-piece sword made up of a dragon hilt &amp; an angled blade piece.</p>

<p>The two ninja you get are the previously mentioned lightning ninja Jay &amp; the earth ninja Cole. We&rsquo;ll start by talking about the main ninja of the set, Jay, who does look pretty good with a good level of printing all down the torso down to the legs with the sash on the waist &amp; some nice printing on the torso with buckles &amp; straps all down the torso &amp; with some simpler printing on the legs but still looks good.</p>

<p>Cole on the other hand just feels simpler in design without all the buckles &amp; straps he just looks flat to me though the orange does work well with the black &amp; he does get foot printing but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that with a flatter torso print he just feels less impressive to me anyway.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Both ninja&rsquo;s come with the new one-piece oxygen tank/breathing apparatus piece that attaches at both the hips &amp; neck &amp; it really is a nice piece that I do hope gets use outside of Ninjago in the future, they also both have the new headgear piece for Seabound that&rsquo;s dual-moulded in clear blue &amp; the ninja&rsquo;s respective colour, black for Cole &amp; blue for Jay. Other inclusions are a pair of black flippers &amp; dark grey gun with clip on top that have gold accessory mounted on top, a drill for Cole &amp; I can&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out what the item mounted to Jay&rsquo;s is supposed to represent.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The last thing to mention is that the set comes with incredibly beautifully crafted Wave Amulet made up of dual-moulded opalescent blue &amp; gold which is just beautiful in my book anyway.</p>

<p>Overall this is definitely a worthwhile set to pick up, is it perfect? No of course not but it is good for its size, price &amp; age rating of 8+ you can&rsquo;t expect a masterpiece, but you do get a great set with few minor nit-picks &amp; nuances but something like the stud-less cockpit can easily be fixed with a few of your own pieces If you so wish.</p>
