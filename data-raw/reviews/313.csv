"legofan3810","2010-06-13T21:12:53.687Z","Kinda Small...........","Well this is a pretty puny Bionicle. My dad dug this set up from one of his old boxes and he said i could have it. I was pretty surprised that bionicle sets could be so small, but i noticed that this was made in it's beginning years. Anyway, this is a fairly OK set. To the Pros and Cons.<br><br>Pros<br>Cool Bionicle<br>Nice addition to anybodies Bionicle Collection.<br><br>Cons<br>The Mask always falls off the back.<br><br>Overall, a 4 out of 5. <br><br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
