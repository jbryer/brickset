"COCONABE","2021-08-23T21:12:03.733Z","Yeah, it's not bad at all","<p>Ok, first review here on Brickset, got this set as an early birthday gift and let me tell you how surprised I am. Between the 71750 Hydro Mech from Ninjago and this, the car&#39;s the winner in my opinion, mainly&nbsp;because I noticed more flaws with the&nbsp;mech. I&#39;ll try to give my thoughts on this other set another time but for now,&nbsp;on to the review!</p>

<p>The minifigs included are Sing Bot and Bass Bot, both robots seem to be&nbsp;from the hip hop realm of Vidiyo. I like how they used various metallic hues to make the details of the minifigs, especially for the use of pearl gold, since it fits so well with the bling bling often found in the global rap imagery. I also dig the accessories and hair pieces, very uncommon to me. My personal favourite has to be Bass Bot, the colour scheme looks more appealing to me compared to&nbsp;Sing Bot.</p>

<p>The beatbits and the display stand included look nice, though it&#39;s obviously tied to the app, and I don&#39;t have any interest into using it on my phone. Good thing it&#39;s sort-of optional with the main build.</p>

<p>Building this car was nice, nothing challenging nor too easy or boring. The amount of details is neat, there were absolutely no stickers, only a few pretty prints with a vinyl disc at the driving seat and a monitor at the back. The core feature of that vehicle is the stage conversion, switching the speakers and the big head (and even the front lights!) to show a new look. It&#39;s decent and satisfying enough, since it goes from yellow to blue in a small amount of time. And the difference is visible too, each side seems to fit one of the included bots as well. Too bad it&#39;s THE feature of this set, there&#39;s not much you can do aside from posing the minifigs on top or placing them inside the car.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m satisfied with this set. It&#39;s not groundbreaking, but&nbsp;it&#39;s quite a neat vehicle to manipulate with your huge minifig hands.</p>

<br />
The minifigs are really cool, I like their designs and the printing is good. They stand out and fit the theme of the set perfectly. The guitar is a little bit of an odd accessory given much of this style of music is done with computers and other digital instruments, but there&#39;s enough music of this style (especially the cross-over songs such as Get Lucky by Daft Punk, It&#39;s Going Down by Linkin Park &amp; The X-Ecutioners) I think it works.<br />
<br />
The car itself is a nice solid build, and it uses a few different techniques and styles. I like the variety of colours, including the blue highlights for the &#39;alternate&#39; look, but it definitely is a very flashy vehicle. There are clever uses of parts to stop the speakers and robot head from turning too far and these mechanisms are subtle enough to not distract from the look of the vehicle. I also think it does a good job of being the perfect mix of a stage piece and a car. I feel like with a little bit of work it could be converted into a passable eight-wide vehicle. The Jacuzzi in the back also feels very apt given how often such features in cars appear in hip-hop/rap/etc. music videos.<br />
<br />
Is this vehicle perfect? No, but my issues are fairly minor. The speakers on the side of the car are quite wobbly even if they are solidly connected due to the 2x2 turntable pieces they are mounted on. The rear of the vehicle feels very cramped compared to the rest, especially due to the large robot head, and whilst it has clearance to get past the taps and goblets, the Jaccuzi seems very small and dark. There are also two holes on either side which could easily have been filled by using two 1x1 plates stacked up. I am not sure about the use of teal for the 1x2 half-cylinder pieces behind the headlights either, as this colour only has use elsewhere on the vehicle as water in the Jaccuzi, and as such it doesn&#39;t quite fit when you turn them around. I would have chosen blue to fit the alternate mode, or white/gold to fit in with the overall look. Finally, the gear used as the hood ornament is a little odd and not secured as well as it could be, and perhaps should have been done a different way or replaced with a different thing entirely.<br />
<br />
Overall I very much enjoyed building this set and I love the aesthetics of it. It really stands out and has a few interesting features to play with. I can&#39;t speak for how it interacts with the app, but on the whole I am very pleased with this set and it will sit happily on a shelf alongside 70911 The Penguin Arctic Roller, a set with which it shares a colour scheme.</p>
