After the mediocre success of &quot;Hidden Side&quot; they recently released VIDIYO as a new attempt to blend&nbsp;the digital world with&nbsp;the world of building bricks. Where &quot;Hidden Side&quot; focused on gameplay and multiplayer action, VIDIYO tries to incorporate&nbsp;the (digital) world of music.&nbsp;</p>

<p>VIDIYO got scoffed at almost immediately after it&#39;s release and seeing the sets at sale for as much as 50%, I think it is fair to say that the new theme is not going to be LEGO&#39; biggest seller.</p>

<p>I picked up the punk pirate ship when it was at nearly 50% off: I simply like pirates and enjoy a bit of punk music now and then.&nbsp;I must say: I am pleased I picked it up.&nbsp;Seeing it build on the shelf brings a&nbsp;smile to my face. It was truly a very, very pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Is this a complete, perfect, accurate rendition of a pirate ship? A model that, with some small adjustments, will fit in perfectly with the rest of your pirate armada? A battle worthy galleon ready to board and plunder innocent merchants&#39; vessels?</p>

<p>Plain and simple answer: no!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>And that&#39;s perfectly fine, it isn&#39;t meant to be. This is considered to be a stage prop for a punk band. And as a stage prop, it works perfectly fine. It&#39;s got vibrant colours, flowing lines, a bit of tongue in cheek (the brick build hook for a hand behind the drumkit). There is a lot more going on then meets the eye, and that is a good thing.<br />
A lot of sub-builds&nbsp;twist and turn (lanterns, boxes, eagles nest, etc), allowing you to (slightly) alter the look of the ship. The back of the ship (backstage) is wonderfully detailed with a treasure chest, a treasure map, a pizza, some bottles, a surfboard...<br />
There is some fabulous brick building going on: the drums, the sharks head, the skull. There is perfect detailing to make it actually look punk (the grey pyramid studs and Mohawks).&nbsp;And last, bot not least: no stickers! Yay!</p>

<p>Yes! I can truly say that I like this. It is just good ol&#39; fun!!</p>

<p>But wait, we haven&#39;t come to the best part yet: the figures.<br />
Oh, boy. Near perfect. I like the squid drummer best, but that is mainly because I have a weak spot for drummers. His head is amazing. It is slightly flexible, so you won&#39;t have to worry about breaking one of its tentacles. The mermaid has amazing yet subtle printing on her tail and that hairpiece is just, wow, stunning!. I expected that&nbsp;piece&nbsp;to be kinda rubbery to, but it is hard plastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;The shark guitarist is proof that LEGO can print white on dark backgrounds if they really want to, and his guitar is simply out of this world. It is so freaking cool.&nbsp;<br />
Just one downside: you only get 3 figures and 6 spots to place figures for the band. Now you could fill up 1&nbsp;spot&nbsp;with the shark singer from the VIDIYO minifigure line and one spot with the punk guitarist from the VIDIYO boxes, but that leaves a 3rd&nbsp;spot open for.... who? Anyway, that&#39;s just me nitpicking...</p>

<p>I did not test the interactive part of this theme for the simple reason that I don&#39;t care for it. So I cannot comment on that - sorry. BUT, honestly, will anyone really buy a VIDIYO set for that, dare I say &quot;gimmick, only? Also, the retail price&nbsp;is way too high, sheesh. This is not worth 70&euro;, even if it is the most innovative thing since sliced bread...</p>

<p>But all that aside.</p>

<p>I truly like this set and I think you will too if you are into pirates, punk and don&#39;t mind a bit of fun.&nbsp;<br />
Just don&#39;t go spending 70&euro; on this, or you will hate yourself forever :D</p>
