"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-07T19:23:18Z","Pride of the Caribbean","this set is great! at first when i was a young lad, i was very into castle as opposed to pirates... but i did own a few sets ( volcano island and harbor sentry) ANYWAYS, recently ive gotton back into the pirate theme and after recently snatching a slightly used Renegade Runner and Shipwreck Island for about 40 dollars, i decided to get some pirate opposition...
I love this ship for a few reasons... one is that the sails are simply blue and white and can be used as many ways.... Merchant... military.... anything you think of there is no restrictoions... also although the &quot;no sails in back&quot; makes the ship look top heavy, it is actually a good design which allows for max playability... my only complaint is that there should be a door and small wall to hide the Cptns Quarters, it just seems too &quot;open&quot;.  Lastly, i dont need a huge imperial base, but am looking at lagoon lockup for a cheapo hideout... can someone write a review back to me telling me if it is worth about 25 bucks? thx! set gets a 9/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I would use it and a soldier's land base to combat my cousin's Black Seas Barracuda. The golden parrot on the bow and the unique windows on the stern made it a little more realistic, as did the detailed white and black strips on the gunwhales (sides). It could have used more cannons, which I got from other sets, than the two it included. Especially neat was the fact that cannons could be fired from the stern. While not large enough to outgun the BSB, it could always outrun her. The sails and flags were likewise detailed. Including the admiral or governor or whoever he was, was also a major plus. The holes in the hull could be covered from the bottom with standard bricks to make it almost waterproof, and when I moved to Arizona and got a pool I set out on many heroic voyages in this ship.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-13T14:28:43Z","another great galleon","as the proud owner of all 3 Imperial galleons, i rate this a 9. i have already stated why i think this is  a very well sized ship in my review of Imperial Flagship (British). 
this set is great. it comes with three French sailors and Admiral Broadside himself. i really like Broadside, so i was excited that i wouldn't have to get Eldorado Fortress just to get him (i decided to get it any way). the sails make this boat great, as there is no emblem making it a difinitive flagship. others say it could be used as a merchant boat, but, when you think about it, no it can't. the sails are huge. there are gun racks here and there, and it comes with two cannons. it can't be a merchant boat very well (oh snap). back to the sails. they are huge! the one in the front is a bit out of proportion compared to the other two, which are so big they make the clipper look quite topheavy. the rigging that leads to the mast deck (NOT a crow's nest!) is very unrealistic, as it is not going up the sides, but rather, leads up from the main deck where the cannons are. however, the gunwhales (sides) have a nice stripe, and the rest of the color combination is nice. the cabin is excelent, especially from the back view. this boat looks the best from behind. however, the steering wheel is a bit too high, and my captain needs a &quot;booster stand&quot; to reach it well. i used the two blue slanted bricks that are in the steering wheel contraption as his stepstool, which made him higher, and the steering wheel lower. now, they're just right size, but it looks a bit wierd. the storage compartment in the front is great, but you can't really use it too well. however, it makes you feel good about the boat just knowing that it is there. that whole little compartment section makes the mast look a bit more stable. the figurehead is great. a golden parrot. pretty cool. the rudder is nice, and the cabin looks good. i mean how the heck is a cabin suposed to look good if you can only see it by ripping off the roof? huh? HUH? HUH!!!!!!!???? ok, i thought so. the set really could have used two ladders, one on either side of the steering wheel. how the heck is the captain suposed to get up there? it doesn't look like such a big distance, but when you look at a figure, it is like twice his size distance. and no sensible captain of a boat is going to crawl up there on the little one-peg-long thing on top of the cannons. if he happens to fall, the boat will either have a dead pilot, in which case they will have trouble navigating, or, if he falls toward the boat, they will have a captain with a broken arm. Hobbes' Choice, people. however, the pros, including the lowering anchor, barely outweigh the cons, and this set deserves a 9 (all Imperial Galleons got a 9 for one reason or the other).

well, the Rigging is indeed a bit weerd (kinda agrea with Sammmmy on this) and I miss the captains personal quarters It would have been really cool if thy made some doors in the design and so. the cabin is only fun from behind atm ...ah well, This ship has 3 soldiers and an admiral! that makes 4 people. witch is really good for an ship this size.

the color sceme is perfect. and also the golden parrot on front of the ship gives it something special.

the sails are great. great colors and lot of fun. it could have done with an extra small sail on the aft mast I think to compensate what some ppl call the topheavy look of this vessel

the Clipper has an wide hull so it can support up to 4!! cannons. in a gun fight in can take on the larger Barracuda as an equal.

"Nased","2007-09-20T13:20:52.42Z","Best Soldier Ship!","This is the first BIG LEGO set that I received when I was a child. It has a special place in my heart. By BIG, I am refering to the cost (more than $100SGD). 

It's the best soldier ship in the whole LEGO series. The sheer size alone is one of the best attribute of this ship. It is the biggest in terms of dimensions and space in the center of the ship. There are a lot of space for me to move my figurines. There are ample weapons and they will defnitely come in handy during an encounter with the awesome 6285 or 6286. The design of the ship is great.

The only reason why I can't give it a perfect score is because of the number of figurines. Don't get me wrong, I love this ship. However, I think that the biggest soldier ship deserves to have a larger crew of at least one more captain and one more imperial guard. That will increase the manpower of this great ship to 1 admiral, 1 captain and 4 guards. Otherwise, I think they will be overwhelmed by the pirates in quantity.

The other points have been mentioned by the other people andI shall not reiterate the points. To end thi, I still think that this ship is the best soldier ship. Time for LEGO to build greater and better Imperial ship. I will give it a 8.5/10. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-09-14T15:44:38.28Z","Lovely clipper, but could have been bigger.","I just bought this set second-hand. It's not entirely complete, but I managed to scramble some ports from my lego collection. I am however missing one blue column, but I found it for a euro on Ebay.

This ship is really the pride of the blue (French) army. It can hold four cannons, but only comes with two. The yellow/golden parrot is really unique, I was really happy when I found that I had that exclusive piece.

The overall length and height are adequate. But when compared to the 6285, which is about the same age, it could have been one hull section longer. Then it accomodate a second large mast with two extra large sails. The rear is nice, but the captain's cabin is to open when watched from inside the ship. I agree with others that this is easily modificated, however.

I made a small modification: I connected the horizontal carrier beams for the large mast upside-down, with the little lego knobs on top that is. Only the above one had to be reinforced by a small 2x4-plate, now I have a look-out on top of the ship :-). I like it better than the red Imperial version (6271).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"albcheng123","2009-11-27T21:44:10.467Z","Vintage Marine Ship","Some people may complain ""Caribbean Clipper "" for her simple design, lack of firepower & soldiers, but the ship should fit well on her title.

A clipper should be a very fast sailing ships in the 19th century (i.e. 18xx), lack of cannon was necessary (to reduce the weight) as its strength should be its speed instead of firepower.

Imagine what may happen when the ""Caribbean Clipper"" meets the mightly ""Black Seas Barracuda (6285)"", the speed & flexibility of ""Caribbean Clipper"" should allow her first strike against the bigger but slower rival.  Since both the ships only have  2 cannons at each side, the first-attacker could gain the advantage. 

It is true that the ""Caribbean Clipper"" only has 4 soldiers (a governor & 3 marine soldiers) compared to 8 pirates from the ""Black Seas Barracuda (6285)"", but everything may be more obvious if both side invest with same amount of resources.

Instead of investing in 1 ""Black Seas Barracuda"", one may purchase 2 to 3 ""Caribbean Clippers"" with same amount of money,and the marines may easily win the scenario.

Pros:
- Classic outlook of the ship
- Innovative design from 1989's perspective
- Many special bricks, such as the ship body, vintage windows, steering wheel, cannons, sailing cloths, yellow parrots
- 3 marine soldiers + 1 governor
- Small storage chamber at the front of the ship
-Sufficient muskets & swords

Cons:
Lack of cannons
Too-open design of the captain (or treasure) chamber, which may cause security concerns",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"LordDunsany","2022-10-16T18:16:01.867Z","A beautiful ship with some major flaws","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The bluecoat ship is a smaller vessel (strictly speaking it is not a ship as it does not have 3+ square-rigged masts) than its #6285 pirate contemporary, having only a single mid-section hull piece. Unlike its redcoat successor #6271, #6274 still uses the 16-stud wide hull pieces found on larger ships. The relatively short and tubby hull shape (opposite that of true clipper) ensures that #6274 is likely slower than both #6285 and #6271, but the wide hull pieces do allow for 2 cannons to be placed back-to-back as well as stern windows that actually access the enclosed area at the stern (the stern window of #6271 is set behind its already open stern deck). Though the ship has gunports and space for 4 cannons, it only comes with 2.&nbsp; The downward opening gunport flaps are an odd design choice that do not seem very practical as they would likely get caught by waves and increase drag/get shorn off.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The ship has an unusual sail plan, with a forward mainmast and a mizzenmast that seemingly serves no purpose except to support the rigging and a large flag. The lack of sails on the mizzen actually makes it worse than useless as it would only increase weight and drag, slowing the ship even further. Although there is no official large blue-and-white striped gaff-rigged sail available that could be placed here (like that of #6271 or #21322), one could attach an additional triangular jib sail (like the one at the bow) on the mizzen using a yard-arm construct similar to that on #6280&rsquo;s mizzen (the mizzen sail on #6280 is placed backwards in the set image (the right angle should be at the rear) and has thinner stripes than the stripes on #6274&rsquo;s sails).&nbsp; It should be noted that the lower attachment point on the mast for this additional sail (which is where it should be placed) is a bit too low without either elevating the yard-arm by at least 5 plate heights or shifting the sail further up the yard; otherwise the sail gets in the way of the ship&rsquo;s wheel and any minifigs on the stern deck. This sail plan (square-rigged mainmast and lateen-rigged mizzenmast) was used by polacca/polacre ships that were common in the Mediterranean (but were probably rare in the Caribbean settings of LEGO Pirates).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The mainmast has two square sails but puzzlingly places a single long shroud rigging piece aft of the mast instead of having two shrouds on the port and starboard sides as on other ships. This arrangement, while fine for playability, makes little functional sense as shrouds are standing rigging that support the mast and thus have a corresponding shroud on the opposite side to provide counter-tension (this is why shrouds are always placed laterally &ndash; though standing rigging also includes fore- and backstays, these lines were narrower than shrouds and almost never had horizontal ratlines).&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The stern cabin (empty except for a treasure chest that doubles as a table) is not enclosed like that of #6285, but I feel that attempts to build a front wall to properly enclose it do not look very good, partially due to the shortness of the stern deck. Stern-castles on some LEGO ships (and many MOCs) have a tendency to look like a tall box got plopped on top of the stern due to the magnitude and abruptness of the height increase &ndash; on actual sailing vessels with elevated stern-castles during the golden age of piracy, the height was gradually stepped up with a partially elevated quarterdeck in front of the fully elevated poop deck, with height increases being rather modest to reduce drag.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Despite all of these design flaws, the ship has an attractive color combination (white hull highlights, blue cabin walls, yellow bow/stern highlights) with beautiful blue and white striped sails. The set comes with a good-sized crew &ndash; the rare &lsquo;governor&rsquo; minifig with a spiffy uniform and decorated bicorne hat as well as 3 unique sailor minifigs that are essentially the officer minifig with red epaulettes instead of yellow and plain smiley faces like the soldiers &ndash; with plenty of weapons. Despite its successor #6271 fixing the major sail-plan and rigging issues with this set, #6274 does have some superior detailing compared to #6271 such as cannonball storage areas between the port and starboard guns, a hatch near the bow, a figurehead (with a rare golden bird piece), a working lowering anchor, a better-looking stern, and more weapon clips, in addition to its more aesthetically pleasing color-scheme and better crew complement.</p>
