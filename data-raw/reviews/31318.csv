<br />
The Minifigures: Batman (Batman Begins suit), and Scarecrow. Two fantastic minifigures, the only problem I have with Batman is there are no printings on his arms or legs, makes him look a little weak in comparison to the actual suit. Scarecrow is perfect though!<br />
<br />
Value for money: Worth it. No... wait... TOTALLY WORTH IT! At $39.99 for 422 pieces, it&#39;s a typical Lego set bargain. But for what the set is, it&#39;s great!<br />
<br />
Playability: A little boxy but this is expected from a Lego vehicle. I like that it seats&nbsp;two. The mobility of the flaps is great. But the guns being right up by the tiers is a little downer for me.<br />
<br />
Parts: Great usage of parts! A lot of diverse pieces that I don&#39;t have from other sets.<br />
<br />
Building experience: The usage of the aforementioned parts are an absolute joy while&nbsp;building! I had a blast building, and a fun time watching the familiar shape from the iconic film series come to life in LEGO form.<br />
<br />
Overall rating: A simple Joy! A truly remarkable addition to my collection. It is just simply better than the original 2008 Tumbler. The sleek, and more compact design is fantastic!</p>
