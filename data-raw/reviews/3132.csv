(Aside from what's down there))","     This is, in my opinion, the most outstanding of all the Imperial Soldiers and Imperial Guards sets.  The large baseplate's shape and the design printed on it give the impression of a rocky &quot;New England&quot; type coast.  The two yellow inverted bricks give the set's support a more elegant look but sturdy.  Those same bricks also give the battlements supporting the cannon a elegant feel.  The walls of the fort have holes in them, wide enough to insert cannons with wheels into them.  The upper portion has a curve on both sides.  Unfortunetly, the governor's door doesn't close properly due to that slant; but he ought to worry more about that than me what with the two pirates around.  The colors themselves are a wonderful and pleasing combination, yellow and white.  Alas, I can't really give this set a no-flaw rating as the crane is somewhat restricted by how it is set up. All in all, a classic piece of LEGO craftmanship on the designer's part.       ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

well triditional by the white and yellow colours. Well one thing which they did with the minfigs are ranks eg.. admrial/govener then sgnt and the 4 soldiers. 2x cannons and a crane. A raised up plate which some poeple dont like but really it gives levels to the set. The dock help support the overall design.You get a main quad and a jail. From the quads you get a steps that goes down to the dock.
seconds level you have a deck with the goveners quaters. On the third level you get a turret with a cannon on top.
Now about the pieces. You get the really uncommen arches and walls. They are so detailed that you can see the cement falling off and exposing the bricks.

for an extra lego has given you two pirates so you can attack with. You get a captain and first mate . also you get a boat no sorry you actually get two :) woow.

Almost any of the early 80's castles are better than this as their bricks mix better with other castle sets and can  be added on to produce bigger castles.  As a stand alone set, this is fine, but a little out of place with the rest of my collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
8 MINIFIGS wow that is alot for a French theme 
2 PIRATES and a 
BROWN BOAT and a RED BOAT

Structure------

THE YELLOW BRICKS remind me about the castle and a time Lego didn't have so many different colours(like the ones in that Prehistoric Creatures...)
CRANE is a neat, and it works!!!
2 CANNONS is good for a starter set for a theme 
JAIL is ok
MANY I MEAN MANY WEPONS which is good to boost an army that doesn't have many guns
ILLUMINATORS all over this set...(very realistic...)
CONSTRUCTION makes it look like Pirates attcked the place
2 FRENCH IMP. FLAGS 
1 MINI PIRATE FLAG

CONS:
NONE REALLY THERE ARE NONE!!!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-28T09:28:19Z","hold on","now why is everyone comparing this set to Imperial Trading Post? HUH?! everyone says &quot;this set is so great compared to the Trading Post nahnahnah...&quot; well, for your info (this goes to everyone that has ever compared any British sets to French sets) they're different eras and different styles of architecture. you can't really compare the two because they're both great and the Trading Post is a British building and the Fortress is a French building they're in different leagues. it's like trying to compare Tom Brady to Randy Moss. they play different positions so it wouldn't be a good comparison. same deal here. the Trading post is fine. there's nothing wrong with it, except that it came with too many pirates and not enough soldiers, but i mentioned that in my review of it.

moving on, this set, like most Imperial sets, I've noticed, has no animals. NONE! not even a freakin PARROT!!! WHAT&quot;S THE DEAL????! none in Eldorado Fortress, None near Sabre Island, MAN where'd they all go! i would say that &quot;at least the Trading Post has a shark...&quot; but that wouldn't be a good comparison, as i said.
I have to admit that this set has almost no architectural flaws, except for the lone door in the top tower. howeever, it is so cool that it makes up for that. on that same floor of that same tower, there is that blunderbuss mounted on a hinge for shooting at invaders. it is soooooo cool, but if they leaned it all the way, they would have trouble getting it back to its origional position, much more trying to shoot out of it.
also, the cannon on that little battlements thing portruding from the frame of the fortress looks so - so naked. it could use at least two-1x1x1-pieces-stacked-on-each-other things to make it look like Fortress battlements. it just looks too vulnerable, even though it's a cannon.
The plaza in the center of the Fortress is fabulous. you can fit tons of people into it, and i find it a good place to stockpile my French officers (tricorned hats... have too many of 'em). the crane doesn't really work. the string is too long. i don't like those little holder things, so i just shoved it into the storage facility, which, by the way, is great. the treasure chest just went in the small tower in the back, the one with the brig, which rocks. the dock is amazing, but should have come with a chain to keep the rowboat from floating away. the fact thet the main doors to the Fortress are so deep beneath that mezzanine structure where Governer Boradside (he is Soooo cool) is standing with his cutlass and transparent chalace is really a realistic and defensve touch, because if  the pirates are trying to open the door, the Soldiers can shoot at them from the plaza and not have to worry about hitting their own fortress.
pirates. PIRATES. this set comes with a scurvy dog and the at-the-time-rare Captain Redbeard. CAPTAIN Redbeard. and guess what the CAPTAIN of the PIRATES is riding on to try to take down a FORTRESS!!!!???? could it be a rowboat?
COME ON!!! what kind of pirate captain attacks fortresses or tries to steal gold in a freakin' ROWBOAT!!!? this set should have excluded Redbear and have a regular pirate in his place, or have a landing rig like there is in Enchanted Island, or even like the types used by the Redbeard in Lagoon Lock-Up or the French one in Rock Island Refuge. it shouldn't just be a ROWBOAT. 
oh, and by the way, if you desperately want Eldorado Fortress and these reviews just  make your mouth water and make you feel bad about yourself, then just click on the link called www.ebay.com across from where it says Resources. Brickset automatically searches for this set on ebay for you once you click. you should be able to find one of them closing  within hours with one bid. there were a lot last time i checked.
it may sound that i don't approve of the set, (when you look at it from afar, it doesn't look too grand at all), but i couldn't find the words to compliment it. it's just so amazing. however, i am surprised i am one of the only ones to find  faults with this set.

There's also battlements, towers, a jail, two cannons, plenty of weapons, a crane and hold for cargo (including the provided treasure chest), a room for Governor Broadside (I don't know where anyone gets the idea this is a French-themed set - he looks very English upper class to me), several imperial soldiers and a pirate boat containing Captain Roger and one of his men.  A fabulous design, this set looks great and has unlimited building possibilities.  I'm sure it will also appeal to younger Lego fans who'll no doubt want to play out a swordfight between Broadside and Roger.  The best of the imperial fort sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"apt142","2008-05-09T11:23:10.327Z","Truly a Legend","I got this set when it first came out many years ago.  Lego at the time was putting out several pirate and non-pirate buildings.  One thing that I had noticed during that time is how often parts of the architecture on those buildings were left open or airy.  

I sensed that this was to save pieces and reduce cost on some of the buildings.  However some of those sets suffered from not being substantial enough.  This set, fortunately, did not suffer that fate.  Everything about Eldorado Fortress is well built and sturdy.  The architectural design is pleasing.  The designer made full use of every inch of the baseplate, including extending it for a dock and fully utilizing the hollow center for a cellar.  

The set comes with plenty of figures.  Additionally, the fortress has plenty of room and detail.  Both of which are quite nice for it's original price point.

If there is a fault with this set, it would be that it is too solid.  Some areas of the Fortress are hard to get to.   This could have easily been remedied with some design changes that allowed sections to be removed and added easily.  But, that's a small complaint.  This set is nearly perfect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:19:48.967Z","Almost 20 years old but still a legend","I believe I got this set in 1989 or 1990, when it was still new. Perhaps I was a little too young at the time (I was 4 or 5) because I can remember that my father built it for me. But when it was finished, I was very happy with it. It has all a fortress should have: cannons, a brig and a cellar. This set is amazing, especially because it has a high ranking officer (I called him &quot;gouverneur Grootzeil&quot;, which is Dutch for governer Great Sail.

A couple of years ago, I tried to rebuilt it, but I didn't have the patience then to put the set back together with all the proper set. I came quite far however. I am sad although because I accidentally broke the base plate, there is a hole in it. But despite the damage, all the parts can still be placed, allthough I do need some narrow beams to reinforce some part of the plate, to stop it from rupturing further.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>Its only &#39;vintage&#39; now of course but meaning more than a harbour, &#39;port&#39; does indeed allude to the fact that the governor enjoys a glass, you&#39;ll see...</p>

<p><b>Minifigure&nbsp;Rating:</b></p>

<p><b>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Governor or &#39;Admiral&#39; (some catalogues) Broadside&#39;s smart blue jacket around gold buttons with gold and black trim is a stand out piece.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Governor&#39;s unusual historical period haircut head.</li>
	<li>The smartest bicorne in Lego with its white frill edging and tassel with a large red feather.</li>
	<li>The red and yellow epaulettes make good rank distinction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Top marks for highly original designs that despite a couple of repeats, have very good print quality and great colour schemes. People vary in describing the soldiers as French, English or generally imperial, they are fortunately just generic enough for you to choose. I&#39;m never sure whether including the &#39;enemy&#39; in a set is what kids always need to create play but with some mix and match the pirates can become civilian traders should you wish.&nbsp;Naval 2nd in command known as &#39;De Martinet&#39; in illustrative literature only, has a black tricorne with a hole available for those spare feathers.</p>

<p><b>Naval Dock</b><br />
Where to begin? The baseplate of course. Its a raised plate and pretty great. These types are not always popular but at least in this theme, its perfect if the buildings rise out of the sea somewhat. Its darker grey rock and boulder shore print has blue waves on top from the blue studded edge making an instant foundation island or outcrop. Its pit and inverted corners make good building potential with the smooth slope providing very good play interaction. In its various incarnations this piece is actually pretty commendable for what it allows.</p>

<p>Both pirates and navy get a grey seated rowing boat, brown and red respectively with a swap for oar colours. The small printed flags are attached with an upside down black aerial pole. These sit outside, questionably over the &#39;water&#39; (a&nbsp;blue cloth does the trick if you can not get enough blue baseplates for making a sea or ocean). Here the harbour edge begins forming with interesting use of high inverted slants that one atop the other and turned 90&deg;&nbsp;perfectly reach the top of the baseplate&nbsp;arch bricks. It must all be made to measure. The black front harbour platform is a clever extension of model area using a technic brick and peg. The walkway is on cylinders and slants for an external area of work or importation. This links back on to the base again and is a slim but really useful feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dungeon gets mostly plated over on thick struts and then fitted with a large grid trap door. This allows half opening or full removal if needed as the back section of the dungeon is rather secreted and can conceal quite a lot of stuff or&nbsp;prisoners&nbsp;if need be. The lower fort area gets busy with arched sections building out in to the sea again. This extends the feel of the model again to a&nbsp;well built fortress sitting right on the ocean. It also creates some lovely steps from walkway to fort interior. Some slants allow an arch on top to create stylish open windows and shooting posts. The yellow panels build above the ground parapets which already are topped with white arches, diagonals and battlements. This inspired colour scheme has eroded and battle damage effects with a favourable red brick print in small patches revealing the true nature of the fortress under would be crumbled plaster. This is seen on the lower diagonal corner and flat panels, yellow and white. A heavy barred door cell exists at the back extending the Navy set&#39;s theme of locking people up and imprisonment. The front gate house is an alternate white to the yellow towers opposite and this large archway holds a couple of hopefully strong brown wood plank doors. More archways extend back from this with small windows above and a more elegant appearance begins forming. Meanwhile the front slope entrance gets a corner with a mini slope made turret that also looks exceptional already.</p>

<p>The two smaller towers are grey plate roofed and topped in thick arched white battlements, the front one getting mostly a thick black derek for lifting cargo. Cleverly anchored at the rear, a black string is threaded through a sideways pivoting arm so when the brown chest is lifted in the crate, it also rises up with the shortening thread available. This is surely near genius. A grey hook on the end easily lifts many things but is most suited to the bendy pipe held black crate and its gold coin cargo. All above the front corner lookout post and steps enabling secure boat to fort delivery.</p>

<p>The upper level is a grey plated balcony with a mounted rifle and smart half door entrance and brick print lined window. Smart tactical windows feature again and the rear is open for play with a cylinder made white pillar. It gets a bit regal here and you know its for someone important, the governor obviously. It might not be so luxurious were it not for his fine crystal glass goblet! I don&#39;t recall seeing this piece previously unless I missed it in a restaurant set but it was an imaginative extra that just transformed the whole set for me adding so much character. This suggested that the governor enjoys a drop of fortified wine and so proceedings in the fortress may be run by an overly merry, blustering admiral type who points with his sword and cares more for his crystal collection than anything else. The lightest touch of imperial madness.</p>

<p>Finishing touches include a front cannon finishing the marvellous small turret and a roof cannon. Both cannons these get a rammer and pile of &#39;cannonballs&#39; and one gets a sword clipped on too. Not to be sniffed at these incredible spring loaded weapons are pulled back and launch cylinder bricks at anyone and anything from their 360&deg; turntables. Adding some contrast always helps a set, here in the form of the beloved palm tree growing at the back. Via clips and hole bricks two brown rifles, a pistol and plentiful trans-yellow &#39;flamed&#39; black torches are also added around the fort upstairs and down. The huge crossed cannon naval flag is flown at the top tower on a stave and once flying over a fully manned and populated building, looks very impressive.</p>

<p><b>Alternative Building</b><br />
The one clearly on the instructions is an interesting more cargo based harbour with a prominent crane, double doored thoroughfare and fortified roof with a cell tower. It seems pretty good but its likely you would always want the main build back as its so likeable a design.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Fortified</b><br />
In my humble opinion, this is simply one of the best large sets of all time and one that is easily as good as the Naval ship in the same subtheme. The design aesthetic&nbsp;is highly&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;with an array of MFs to interact with the various features, be it dragging a boat up the ramp, unloading or loading goods or seeing how many pirates you can fit in the dungeon and cell, possibly all of them? To a kid it could rank among best Christmas presents ever and to an adult&nbsp;collector an absolute keeper, worthwhile for its fun historical ethos and very&nbsp;enjoyable build. Optional extensions in the form of the other naval sets, custom building and ocean-scaping increase its high&nbsp;play merits. I&#39;ve tried to find fault and&nbsp;some ever so slightly weaker build points are ignorable for what they achieve, so&nbsp;it remains solid gold.</p>

"Ernst","2017-02-07T17:24:53.83Z","Eldorado Fortress, an all time master piece !!","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : I had this set already waiting some 6 years but incomplete. I finally found the time to list the missing parts, ordered them in several Bricklink stores and was now able to built it. This is in my opinion, aside from the ships, together with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6277-1/Imperial-Trading-Post"">Imperial Trading Post</a> the best Pirate set of the whole range. If I&#39;m correct the first Lego set with a raised base plate. It can compete with comparable Castle sets like <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6081-1/King-s-Mountain-Fortress"">6081</a> and win thanks to the great yellow/white color scheme. It is both a playable set and a collectors item and if Lego should ever decide to re-release legendary sets a great candidate.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks </strong>: Like all sets of those years great fun building this Fortress. In those years the building instructions where less detailed than the present ones so it asks 110% dedication. You start with the floor, the hatch and the outside parts like the small scaffolding Than off course all upwards. All small bricks and several wall and cornerwall parts. The final result is a great looking, extremely good defendable Fortress. I love the double entrance with in front the big&nbsp;arch and behind it the real entrance with the 2 small brown wooden doors. It is an elegant and very stable building.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : A superb collection of parts : the printed yellow and white wall parts and the raised base plate for starters. The set offers no less then 8 mini figures with a load of weapons and two small boats. Further on a great variety of useful parts like arches, the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2462&amp;idColor=1#T=S&amp;C=1&amp;O={&quot;color&quot;:1}"">bricks with modified facets</a> and plates in several shapes and sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : The content and the building result tell the story. If you could give a higher ranking this set would deserve it !!</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong> : It depends if you are looking for a set to play with or as a collectors item. The current value according to <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=6276-1#T=P"">Bricklink</a> is an average of some &euro;130,00 which is a lot of money but as a collectors item worth every cent you spent. Getting harder to find because of its age (28 years now) so if you love the Pirates theme and stumble into this set I simply advise you to buy it.</p>

 set is arguably the best land base available in the Pirate theme, I was
 not sure whether to place this in the large or medium list, but due to 
its love and respect from all pirate fanatics I feel that it is a large 
set. The nice thing about this is the fact that it is swarming with 
minifigs. It features one commander, one officer and four (that’s right 
four) soldiers, this in itself is an instant army builder, problems with
 later faction released is that there was always too many officers and 
not enough of the basic soldier, with the blue faction and this set in 
particular this is not an issue. The set also feature two pirates to 
fight against the imperials (or attempt to breakout of the jail), 
overall this set is very strong, I don't even feel I need to point out 
how good the design of the base is, the two rowboats, the neat little 
dock out front(just look for yourself).<br><br></span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"PhilBuilds","2022-12-17T01:43:51.49Z","Thirty plus years on, still my favourite set.","<p>A YouTuber I was watching recently made an interesting observation whilst reviewing some Classic Space sets (a break from his typical channel content of&nbsp;&nbsp;80&#39;s action figures). His childhood interest in Lego had been brief and he acquired just a handful of sets before returning to G.I. Joe and 3 and 3/4&quot; Luke Skywalkers. The point he made was that even way back then, kids didn&#39;t tend have equal amounts of Lego and other toys - the kids who were into Lego, were really into Lego, and seemed to choose it to the exclusion of everything else. It was, he said, a &quot;lifestyle&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what has this got to do with the Eldorado Fortress? Well I was one of those kids, and for me, the Eldorado Fortress is where my Lego lifestyle began. For me it arrived on Christmas morning in either &#39;89 or &#39;90 and it was the largest Lego set I&#39;d ever seen. A serious departure from the tub of old assorted bricks from the 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s that my sister and I shared. I was hooked. Over the next few years my collection would grow to include most of the first wave Pirates, but the Eldorado Fortress always had pride of place. Lego dominated this period of my childhood. Christmas lists and birthday wishes, it was Lego all the way. At least until a Commodore Amiga arrived some years later, giving rise to another lifelong passion!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to know where to start. There&#39;s just so much to this set. The 3D base plate combined with a generous piece count for the time is used to tremendous effect. Its inclusion is in no way a lazy attempt to pad out a set (think 6821&hellip;). Rather, it elevates and projects the whole build, allowing the fortress to dominate its surroundings. Imagine how different it would be if it were on a standard&nbsp;32x32 baseplate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are numerous &#39;play zones&#39; in the set. We have a dock area (with a treasure hoisting crane), the baseplate ramp leading to a double doored entrance, a huge courtyard area with dungeon and gaol, several look-out posts, two artillery positions and of course a chamber for the Governor. And I nearly forgot to mention the two small boats! Populating these areas is an army of minifigures, eight in all. Governor Broadside, with his red feather adorned&nbsp;bicorne and gold detailed Admiral&#39;s jacket is possibly&nbsp;the finest minifig ever released in any theme. Also rare, he&#39;s&nbsp;seen only in this set and in a similar form in 6274. Under his command are an Imperial Officer (Lt. Martinet) and squad of soldiers. Their blue uniforms are simply electric against the yellow and white backdrop of the fortress and having four identical soldiers creates a sense of uniformity and discipline amongst the Imperials. (I always did have a need for order and tidiness - it bothered me as a kid that the Pirate Officers on my Barracuda didn&#39;t even have matching trousers!). The obligatory Red Beard and a Pirate Bo&#39;sun complete the minifigure ensemble.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this set, playability is off the scale. It also combines so well with the other Lego Pirate sets. Whilst&nbsp;the Pirates have the upper hand (hook?) on the waves with the Barracuda, the Imperials have the clear advantage when it comes to&nbsp;land bases.&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if this was an intentional design choice, but it certainly brings a nice balance to the theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent an evening building this recently, taking my time and savouring the experience. It was rewarding and nostalgic. The building techniques are straightforward with the beautiful, old school instructions assembling the parts in just 24 main steps. The end result is visually stunning and the level of detail achieved with just 462 parts is impressive. Form follows function and this is classic Lego at its very best. A modern set of this size would probably have double the piece count -&nbsp;all cheese slope and fiddly accessories.</p>

<p>The Eldorado Fortress comes as close to Lego perfection as it&#39;s possible to get. Aesthetics, playability and building experience,&nbsp;Neils Milan Pedersen&#39;s&nbsp;design is a genuine masterpiece. To my eye there are no real faults but if I&nbsp;had to find one I would say the&nbsp;top room is a little spartan&nbsp;(a&nbsp;few brown 1x1 cylinders, a 2x4 plate and a pirate map tile make a&nbsp;fine oak desk for a Governor!).&nbsp;Regrettably, I sold my entire Lego collection as a teenager, all with pristine boxes and instructions (yes, it hurts!). So, when I emerged from my dark ages the Eldorado Fortress was the obvious place to start. Now a kid in my 40&#39;s, it&#39;s back in my collection and is just as magnificent as it was all those years ago.</p>

<p>Collectors looking to add 6276 to their collection should carefully consider the 3D baseplate. These are flimsier than I remember as a kid and an example with cracks or missing corners will be expensive to replace. Make sure Broadside is present with the correct torso pattern and hat. Also&nbsp;check for solid stud head if mould pattern bothers you. Again, all&nbsp;these parts are expensive.&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of white used in the set so do look out for excessive UV yellowing. The 6x4 flags are often affected too so watch out for that and check for&nbsp;intact clips. Expect to pay around &euro;250 for a nice unboxed example (2022).</p>
