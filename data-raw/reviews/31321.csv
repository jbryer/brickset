<p>I bought this set exclusively for 3 of the minifigures. I highly regret paying full price for this set. I have many issues with the build and a few of the minifigures, which I will detail in this review.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The build experience was bland and tedious. There were no interesting build techniques, and applying all the stickers was infuriating.</p>

<p>The model itself is flimsy all over. Every time I pick it up, pieces come off, and they&#39;re incredibly annoying to reattach. Not to mention that this chunk of the Sanctum doesn&#39;t even look good. It&#39;s simply a facade, but it looks incredibly incomplete from both the front and back.</p>

<p>There are no real play features on this model, aside from messing around with all the little knick-knacks spread around the Sanctum. No enjoyment can really be taken from this Sanctum.</p>

<p>The bug monster is just random. I mean, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll understand why it&#39;s here after we see the film, but it just seems like a useless inclusion. Its parts could&#39;ve been used to improve the Sanctum build, but instead they&#39;re wasted on this dumb enemy build. It&#39;s not even that fun to play with and the build looks unfinished.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The main draws&nbsp;for this set are the minifigures, but even they come with a few disappointments.</p>

<p>Doctor Strange looks great, featuring more accurate prints and an update cape piece which looks fantastic. I don&#39;t have any complaints with this figure. Wong also looks good, although dual molded legs would&#39;ve made the figure better. I&#39;m still quite satisfied with both of these guys.</p>

<p>Spidey looks great... besides the lack of arm printing which I feel was necessary for a figure as important as this. I still like the printing on the torso and legs, especially with the additional dual molding. MJ is pretty bland. I like her face print and hair, but her torso is reused and looks strange without arm printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the first 2 figures are good, but Spidey and MJ have some critical flaws that make the minifigures slightly less desirable.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>Why would anyone pay full price for this? I highly regret not waiting until this was on sale. The price per part ratio is weak, not to mention that most of the parts are small to average sized. The minifigures are high quality, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re enough to make this set worthwhile. There is little play and display value here. In the end, I feel that the value is very mediocre.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great Doctor Strange and Wong</li>
	<li>Some good parts</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Terrible play and display value</li>
	<li>Bad p/p ratio</li>
	<li>Unfinished-looking builds</li>
	<li>Minifigures have critical flaws</li>
	<li>Flimsy build</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>This set is not at all worth it. Some minifigures are weak, the build is flimsy and ugly, and the set overall is just worthless besides the Doctor Strange and Wong. I beg you, don&#39;t buy this set at full price. Either get it on clearance or get the minifigures somewhere else. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to anyone but the most dedicated Marvel fans.</p>

"legit_khajiit","2021-10-28T02:44:14.947Z","Great parts pack, not quite adequate as playset","<p>As a fan of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, this set was one I was immediately keen to purchase. The previous Sanctum Sanctorum sets have been very strong to me - the 2016 set a great vignette display piece, and the 2018&nbsp;<em>Infinity War</em>&nbsp;set a strong play set and display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This, however, doesn&#39;t really fit either category. The minifigure selection is great and all of them look fantastic, even though I&#39;m still mixed on the new cloak element for Strange. The buildable monster is fun and a nice build, and I think more could&#39;ve been done to improve its size while taking a bit off the &quot;sanctum&quot; itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sanctum has some incredible pieces and continues a strong history of fun minibuilds in these sets. The shelves, couch, workshop counter, and desk are all fun and look good. But the unfinished feel of the walls particularly around the heavily-stickered areas makes it look off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough play value for kids but the reason you&#39;re buying this set is for the figures, and they are good enough.&nbsp;</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-12-25T16:40:54.42Z","Yâ€™know, this set is something of a great parts pack","<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve seen No Way Home, there isn&rsquo;t a better time to do a review of the new set based off the film (no spoilers in this review). Spider-Man at the Sanctum Workshop is technically the only set to have come out from the movie thus far, the other 2 sets are branded under No Way Home, but are actually based off the previous 2 films.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>The Sanctum Workshop:</b> I&rsquo;ve seen people complain that this build is too messy and incoherent, while I agree to some extent, I actually like the messy appearance as it&rsquo;s going for the look of an unorganized and sort of abandoned workshop. There&rsquo;s a ton of interesting knickknacks and accessories all over the place, some worth mentioning are the relatively new hourglass piece, a toolbox, a boom box, a tan egg, a game controller, a candelabra, a bike and a sextant. On the left side, there&rsquo;s an interdimensional monster coming out of a chest, which looks really cool, a shelf with a lot of interesting accessories and a desk with a cookie, mug and computer on it, there&rsquo;s a printed keyboard and the sticker on the computer shows an article about Spider-Man&rsquo;s identity. The middle part is a large archway leading into a grotto-like area, which certainly could&rsquo;ve been expanded upon, but oh well. There&rsquo;s also a spider and a scorpion to add to the scene. The frame itself uses interesting stickers that give it nice details, but the stickers were extremely excessive and got really annoying to apply. Finally, the right area has a tool rack and some more accessories like a chalice, a bottle and a barrel of jewels, as well as a couch for relaxation, which was a nice inclusion. Overall, I don&rsquo;t mind the messy nature of the build as it&rsquo;s clearly the intent. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s perfect, it could&rsquo;ve been executed better, but I like it nonetheless.</p>

<p><b>The Random Bug Monster:</b> spoiler alert I guess? This is a completely made up thing from Lego that&rsquo;s not in the movie, with that in mind, it kinda sets the foundations for a useless and lackluster build, but to my surprise, I actually like it. I like the use of vines as the legs, it&rsquo;s good part usage, and more often than not, can support the rest of the bug just fine. There&rsquo;s a hinge on the abdomen for some articulation and the arms and pincers provide a great range of movement. There&rsquo;s one sticker used on the model which provides some nice detail, and I like how the face was built. Overall, I initially didn&rsquo;t like the inclusion of this monster, but upon building it and seeing it in person, it&rsquo;s actually pretty good, the execution really saved this build.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Spider-Man (integrated suit):</b> This brand new Spider suit actually appears in the movie and is exclusive to this set. The integrated suit is basically the red and black suit from Far From Home but with nanotech integrated, thus there&rsquo;s trims of gold on the suit. I really like the design and I think Lego nailed it, the detailing is good all around, the presence of dual-molded printed legs is appreciated and the gold on the spider symbol looks great. The head uses the updated Spider-Man print introduced with the Marvel CMF, the eyes are given more depth which looks cool. Finally, he comes with his web blasts accessories as expected. Overall, a really neat figure, super happy with how it came out.</p>

<p><b>Doctor Strange:</b> Everything about this version of Doctor Strange is different from previous versions. The torso and leg prints seem more simplified, but the design remains excellent, and it works well. The face prints are new with a smiling and angry expression and I really like both of them. The hair is now using a &ldquo;swept and tousled&rdquo; design, with gray streaks printed on either side, and I think this hair works just as well as the dog trainer hair. Finally, the new plastic mold for the cloak of levitation is fantastic, the shaping and appearance is perfect, this design of cape allows for it to be put on and removed without taking the figure&rsquo;s head off, though if you want to reduce the risk of the piece snapping over the years, I&rsquo;d recommend to not do it too often. Overall, this is a great update for Doctor Strange, I like everything about it, and he&rsquo;s my favorite figure of the set.</p>

<p><b>Wong:</b> This version of Wong has his dark red and purple sorcerer outfit which looks really cool, but with a fun spin to it. With the sanctum being snowy during the movie, Wong is wearing a yellow winter jacket over his sorcerer outfit, the back has excellent detail to continue the jacket design, which has a furry hood as well. The face print is new, with a smile and raised eyebrow expression with some stubble as well, it looks good, though I&rsquo;m disappointed with the lack of an alternate face. The &ldquo;Finn&rdquo; hair piece as I like to call it, is used here, I think it&rsquo;s decently serviceable, but a different hair piece might have worked better. Overall, it&rsquo;s nice to finally get Wong in a wide release set, he has excellent detail and his inclusion here is welcome, though part of me wishes Ned was here instead of Wong since he barely appears in the movie.</p>

<p><b>MJ: </b>MJ is the only figure that isn&rsquo;t exclusive to the set, mixing and matching existing prints and pieces, but coming out rather well in my opinion. The legs are just plain black and the torso is a sand blue shirt with a plaid that has a nice sand green and dark red pattern. The face returns from the original<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh583/mj-(michelle-jones)"">&nbsp;Michelle Jones&nbsp;</a>figure from Far from Home, which has since been used on numerous other figures, but still fits the character very well, with a smile and skeptical raised eyebrow expression. Finally, the hair is the wavy hair piece in dark brown which fits the character a lot better than the ponytail piece used for her previous version. Overall, I&rsquo;m pleased with this version of MJ, it looks like the character which is all I could really ask for.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set retails for R800, which is just too much, plain and simple. It should&rsquo;ve been priced around the &ldquo;30 dollar price&rdquo; of R570-R600 which would&rsquo;ve felt more reasonable. If this set interests you, definitely wait for a good discount.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The minifigures are obviously the main highlight of the set, they&rsquo;re all awesome and well-detailed, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let that overshadow the build. I find the workshop enjoyable, and like I said, I don&rsquo;t mind its messy look. Did the random bug monster need to be here? No, but it&rsquo;s a surprisingly good build. I can understand why this set just doesn&rsquo;t do it for some people, but personally, I like it and I&rsquo;d recommend this set for MCU fans. Hopefully, Lego does spoiler-filled sets on No Way Home in the future.</p>
