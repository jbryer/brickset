"Bowtie_Bricks","2021-08-11T17:26:35.327Z","A decent set, filled with several large flaws","<p>Starting from the head and working our way down, the mask build is, to me, not the best build. There are gaps on the sides, and it has a 2 hinge connection system, that will easily pop off if you push it the right way.</p>

<p>Each arm&#39;s different weapons are fun for play, and can luckily be removed with (relative) ease. My favourite part of the set is the fake hydraulics on the arms. The system works fantastically, and looks accurate as well.</p>

<p>The main body is just as you would expect, with the exception of the hip. In my experience, it is not connected enough and tends to come off of the circle base.</p>

<p>The legs are strongly built. No complaints here!</p>

<p>And the figures.... Iron Man is great, but Pepper and Obadiah are bland and just reuse older parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, I would recommend to pick this up on rollback, for 20% off.</p>

"maharage923","2021-09-25T21:11:47.777Z","Better than nothing","<p>I thought I could hold off on buying this until it went on discount but I had to give it a shot because I wanted to make several improvements. In short, there are some great parts about this and some really hard to overlook flaws.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This set finally exists, and we get 3 unique figs: the first red Iron Man suit, Stane, and a different Pepper Potts. The set doesn&#39;t really need more, and I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t pack the price even more by including random civilians or cars.</li>
	<li>The fingers and arm pistons look really good, I&#39;m sure that was partially how this idea came about. I&#39;ve long thought that those piston parts, since I first saw them on the Fury-class Interceptor, would be perfect for Iron Monger but never got around to designing my own.</li>
	<li>Similarly, the pistons look really good from the back, which is saying something because few sets, especially large figures, look good from a rear view.</li>
	<li>The colors used on the gunmetal gray parts are sweet and nice to have for modifying the build or using elsewhere. Some of the armor shells came in pearl dark gray in the Wakanda sets too so having more is convenient.</li>
	<li>Similar to #1, the Infinity Saga idea for sets from movies that never got any is GENIUS. That alone will probably make me buy them all.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>WAY too big overall. Comically out of scale.</li>
	<li>Even if the whole size is too big, the proportions are off with the gigantic head plate, a design that worked well for Molten Man and Venom, and THAT was it. Really not a good choice here, I&#39;ll be making a new head asap.</li>
	<li>There are no hand repulsors on the actual figure, if I&#39;m not mistaken. This is too similar to the oversized Hulkbusters and supposed to be smaller.</li>
	<li>I HATE the immovable knees that started with the War Machine Buster (another sub-par&nbsp;set), they look ugly from the side and take up too much space and too many parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;re pressed for cash, wait until this discounts at Walmart to maybe $28-30. NOT worth 40 as is, but nice to have after some serious modding. Check out Blackwell Bricks on Facebook for a much improved budget design I made.</p>
