<p>The Infinity Gauntlet was one of the mostly highly anticipated sets of the news Infinity Saga wave. I was quite excited about this set, although wasn&#39;t initially&nbsp;one of my favorites, since I tend to lean towards minfigure-scale sets. However, this set is definitely the exception to that.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>There were several interesting build techniques used during the process of building this model. Adding all the metallic gold pieces felt very satisfying. The build was short and sweet, and it almost always felt like you were constantly building something different.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The Gauntlet looks absolutely majestic, especially since the designers decided to go with the incredibly beautiful metallic gold color. The Infinity Stones stand out a lot, but in a way that makes the model look a lot better. There is plenty of articulation that will allow you to get the Gauntlet into some neat poses. You can make plenty of hand signs with this model. The Gauntlet very closely resembles its on-screen counterpart. There aren&#39;t any fun features or play elements to this, as&nbsp;this model relies heavily on its display aspect.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>I personally believe that this model should&#39;ve been less costly, but I understand LEGO&#39;s decision to have it priced at $70. The large pieces and metallic gold bricks probably amped up the price. This set has very little play value, but it makes up for it with its gorgeous appearance. I can see adult collectors eating this set up. I will certainly put this set up in a place where I can see it and adore its beauty. While it may not have good play or price per part value, I think the sheer displayability of this set makes it worth the steep $70 price.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Incredible display piece</li>
	<li>Useful drum lacquer gold pieces</li>
	<li>Great articulation&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Steep price</li>
	<li>Little play value</li>
	<li>No minifigures&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is worth the price due to it being a magnificent display piece. The iconic weapon is translated perfectly into LEGO. I strongly recommend this&nbsp;to older collectors and other&nbsp;<em>Marvel</em>&nbsp;fans.</p>

<p>The fact that the fingers can move only improves the overall quality of this set</p>

"chief7575","2022-01-04T15:01:29.117Z","Oh SNAP, this is a fun set to display","<p>This is the first set of the display &quot;busts/items&quot; that I have purchased and built.&nbsp; While I like the concept of them, I didn&#39;t really care for any of the Star Wars or previous Super Hero busts that were available.&nbsp; Mostly because of price and the fact that they are definitely JUST a display piece, so you really aren&#39;t re-building/playing with these sets that much.</p>

<p>Having said all of that - I waited until this was on discount before picking it up.&nbsp; Getting it at 20% discount was a very good value at that price point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Construction - fairly straightforward.&nbsp; Build a solid base with exposed studs and then start snapping different small builds around it to create the shape of the gauntlet/glove.&nbsp; I was/am very impressed with how well the overall shape and design came out.&nbsp; In particular, the articulation of the fingers and thumb is very ingenious and excellent!&nbsp; Once I realised why the connection points were done a particular way, it dawned on my how great it was, allowing for much more movability without degrading the sturdiness of the model.&nbsp; Re-creating the &quot;snap&quot; or any number of realistic formations with your hand is very doable with this model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts wise - wow, so many gold parts!!!&nbsp; It&#39;s a serious treasure trove of drum lacquered gold pieces.&nbsp; Even if you are buying this model for those parts, you must be coming out ahead!&nbsp; I was also impressed with how blending the gold pieces with different shades of tan and nougat colours worked so well for the overall aesthetics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kudos for the designer for also building up to the final piece assembly - placing each gem onto the gauntlet as a final fun way to complete the piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are even slightly a fan of Marvel, I think you will really enjoy displaying this set!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2022-03-18T15:50:48.637Z","I am Inevitible","<p>This set comes with a good amount of the gold colour of pieces not pearl gold. That makes it look so much cooler and more accurate to the movies. The stone builds for each are cool looking using transparent tile so hats neat. The poseability with the fingers is great and allows you to make the snap pose as well as other gestures. This set can be displayed on a shelf where it would look great, not sure you would want it displayed on a desk because its a little tall and might get knocked over a bit. Overall this is a set of something that is already considered iconic and will be for years to come so I highly recommend picking this up as it looks great on display.&nbsp;</p>

"elbigdaddy101","2023-04-10T16:36:11.057Z","The best Marvel display piece","<p>This was one of the many Lego Marvel Superheroes &quot;Infinity Saga&quot; line I picked up in 2021, while it is inferior to some of the bestselling sets of that line such as 76200 Bro Thor&#39;s New Asgard and 76192 Avengers Endgame Battle, it offers the best display of any Marvel set from the line, including 76209 Thor&#39;s Hammer and 76217 I am Groot.</p>

<p>The build, while every element is repeated about twice, is surprisingly fun, with many interesting pieces. With display sets like this it is often interesting to see how the build develops and slowly turns into a recognisable object.</p>

<p>I have displayed this ever since I got it and to this day it still amazes me how accurate it looks to the gauntlelt from the movies and just how amazing of a LEGO model it is. It is also very postable which can result in some <i>interesting&nbsp;</i>hand gestures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some may be surprised that I gave this set a 2 for playability as a display set, but it offers an interesting challenge to act like it is a gauntlet that can fit on your hand, which I believe earns it a point</p>

<p>Also, the durability of this model may be the most impressive part. I shook the model by the bottom of the stand and I had to get quite aggresive before the gauntlet disconnected from it&#39;s base.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4/5</p>

<p>The best display set for any Marvel Fan</p>
