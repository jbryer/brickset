<p>After the highly disappointing Avengers: Endgame wave in 2019, I was incredibly excited at the prospect of getting more accurate Avengers: Endgame sets and figures. I actually found this set a day before it was released in the U.S., so I guess that is worth noting as well.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The build experience, as usual, wasn&#39;t anything special, although I enjoyed it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the model, it is very similar to 2019&#39;s Compound Battle set, however, it lacks the garage section and focuses on a larger office building. The compound building, once again, has two floors. Similar to the Compound battle, the first floor is a science lab and the second floor is a lounge. The entrance to the building has a small pad for scanning LEGO hands. On one side is the science lab which holds the nano-gauntlet and has a few computer screens. To the other side is a jail cell for Thanos. It&#39;s comically oversized and fits the Mad Titan perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second has a lounge on one side. The table is interesting, featuring a transparent round plate. 3 seats are located near the table and a rack for guns is placed beside it. The other side is open, so Thanos can stand up in the cell.</p>

<p>On the sides of the compound, two structures can be seen. One is a cannon that is directly reused from another Marvel set, and the other is a destroyed sign with the Avengers logo on it. This structure looks out of place due to the rest of the compound being completely untouched.</p>

<p>Antman&#39;s van is a surprising inclusion. It has room for about 3 figures to fit comfortably inside and is decorated with a variety of stickers. The quantum portal can be accessed from the back.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>The minifigures are definitely the main draw of this set.</p>

<p>First, a Chitauri is included. This is a nice redesign of the previous Chitauri, and I&#39;d say it&#39;s the best and most movie-accurate of all of them.</p>

<p>Black Panther is here, and while not exclusive, is still a nice inclusion for that WONDERFUL purple and black suit. However, I feel this minifigure lacks printing on the legs and arms.</p>

<p>Wanda (or Scarlet Witch) is present as well. This is based on her Civil War/Infinity War/Endgame suit. This figure is somewhat disappointing, seeing as she is missing her tailcoat piece. The face is weird as well, as it has a smiling facial expression on both sides, and as we know, Wanda is not usually very happy, especially in the scene that this is representing.</p>

<p>The Marvel Trinity is included in this set. Iron Man is carried over from the previous Endgame sets, and he looks just as good as he did two years ago. Cap has an exclusive torso which looks amazing, although I would&#39;ve wanted some arm printing or dual-molded legs. Thor is included here as well as in the Guardians&#39; Ship set. He looks just about perfect, especially since he has a new facial expression and recolored hairpiece.</p>

<p>Thanos is the standout for this set, introducing a new bigfig system that has a rotatable head and studs on the back. He&#39;s decked out with all new and more detailed printing on the torso and knees, but he lacks the arm printing. This is an easy fix though, for those that have the previous compound battle set (which I do). He comes with his Butter Knife&nbsp;of Ultimate Death, which is incredibly oversized. I recommend making your own blade for him.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For 500-ish pieces, $70 seems like a bit high a price. However, I&#39;m willing to forgive this set as it includes a bigfig and other incredible minifigures. The builds aren&#39;t anything too special (besides the van), and the play and display values are surprisingly low. I can&#39;t say this is the greatest value I&#39;ve ever seen, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past you if you bought this set only for the minifigures as I did.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Incredible minfigure selection!</li>
	<li>Nice Antman&#39;s van build</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Low price per part value</li>
	<li>Mediocre play and display value</li>
	<li>Somewhat pricey</li>
	<li>Some disappointing figures</li>
	<li>Uninteresting builds</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>In the end, I still love this set despite it lacking in the builds and in the price. The minifigures alone justify buying this set, but unfortunately there isn&#39;t much else here. If you&#39;re a big fan of Marvel, I would definitely recommend you buy it. If you&#39;re not a Marvel fan, I wouldn&#39;t say to go out of your way to get this.&nbsp;</p>
