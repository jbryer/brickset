<p>One of the most anticipated sets of this year was the new and improved Benatar. The original was a great set, but I was excited at the prospect of a remake. This set, although not without its flaws, does not disappoint.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>This set didn&#39;t actually take very long to build. Perhaps it is just me improving at LEGO construction, but it really only took about 5 hours, which isn&#39;t as much as I expected for a set of this size. It was quite a fun time, especially when building the interior.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>As a set with almost 2000 pieces, this set is quite large. The main bulk of the set is in the interior. However, the wings and the thrusters are also quite heavy and add a lot of length and width to the model.</p>

<p>The interior is one of the most detailed I&#39;ve ever seen. There is enough space for 4 figures sitting down and 2-3 standing up. All the meticulous details inside make it feel like a home for the Guardians and not just some boring ship.</p>

<p>The wings are sturdy and use a variety of pieces to create texture. The thrusters&nbsp;are also very intricate, with my favorite part being the mechanical pieces that move along with the thrusters.</p>

<p>The asymmetry of the model does wonders to make the ship feel more unique. Along with this, the moving parts on it allow for you to customize how you want to display this. The stand also provides you with options for how to display the Benatar.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Along with the great build, this set has an impressive array of minifigures, albeit with a few misses.</p>

<p>Quill, Rocket, Mantis, and Teen Groot are all exclusive. I love all of them, especially the new Groot and Rocket. My only problem here is the lack of leg printing for Mantis, but it truly doesn&#39;t bother me much.</p>

<p>Thor and the Chitauri, on the other hand, aren&#39;t that great. Thor is reused from a set that I already have, so I really don&#39;t need this minifigure. The same thing applies to the Chitauri. The thing that makes these figures especially frustrating is that we&#39;re missing Drax and Nebula. I have no idea why they&#39;re not included since they could&#39;ve been here in the place of Thor and the Chitauri.</p>

<p>While this set has some great figures, the missing Guardians really hurt this set.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison</strong></p>

<p>(Yes, I do own the first Benatar from the Infinity War sets)</p>

<p>The original Benatar was significantly smaller and less intricate&nbsp;than this. It lacked a lot of the detailed that this one has, and it was also inaccurate to the screen (the sand blue isn&#39;t on the ship in the film). The interior also doesn&#39;t have as much space or detail. All of these flaws are understandable though, as the original was based on concept art and focused more on the play value</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend buying the new one instead of going out of your way to buy the original.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For $150, I feel this set provides enough &#39;stuff&#39; for the price. The set is large enough for its size, and while it doesn&#39;t have much play value, it isn&#39;t a play set. It has incredibly high display value thanks to all the customization options on the model.&nbsp; The value is great for what the set is trying to be.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Beautiful spaceship build</li>
	<li>4 exclusive minifigures</li>
	<li>Display options</li>
	<li>Great value</li>
	<li>Sturdy for play</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Expensive</li>
	<li>2 disappointing minifigures</li>
	<li>Small interior</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, the Benatar (Guardians&#39; ship) is a great set&nbsp;with mostly spectacular minifigures and a majestic&nbsp;build. I&#39;d recommend this set to any Marvel fans or fans of LEGO spaceships.&nbsp;</p>

"Ekmin","2021-08-20T20:05:14.463Z","Guardians Ship - about 4 movies to build","<p>This was the third set I bought and built after not touching bricks for 20+ years. After watching the whole Marvel series during coronavirus lock down, I realised I really liked the universe and had to get some sets! Guardians of the Galaxy being one of my favourite films from the series made the decision to get the ship a lot easier. Load up both of the films and away we went!</p>

<p>Starting with the ships main hull provided an excellent base to build from. Adding in little details really made the interior feel real, and fun to play with. Throughout the build I would place minifigs in and take some pictures.</p>

<p>The included minifigs left something to be desired, but I can see why they chose the ones that they did. This ship is from the Endgame film, thus the inclusion of Thor. When you switch his face to be lit up with lightning, it looks great! I assume they added the Chitauri just for playability, which I can appreciate.</p>

<p>But where is Drax and Gamora? I can sort of see leaving out Gamora, but I may have to watch End Game again to really be convinced.</p>

<p>This is &quot;The Guardians&#39; Ship&quot; and it should have <strong>all</strong> the Guardians.</p>

<p>The build remained solid all the way through, no tricky or flimsy attachments. I will say, it is a bit hard to hold while trying to attach the wings and the back part. I kind of wish that I built the stand as an earlier step, so I had something holding it up while I attached the wings and other moveable bits that are located on the sides.</p>

<p>The display stand included is fantastic, and I probably would not have purchased this without it. Building it is simple enough, as well is placing the ship on it. When attached it can be displayed in 2 ways. The first is kind of angled up as if the ship is rising after take off, making it look and feel a bit taller. The second and the way that I have it displayed is angled a bit down. When displayed this way it gives the ship some meaner angles when looking at it, especially when you spread the extra wing flaps and other parts out the rear. Another neat feature of the stand is that you can remove some smooth parts on whichever side the ship is facing revealing studs which provide you just enough space to display all 6 included minifigs.</p>

<p>All in all, I would definitely recommend this set to any marvel fan, and highly recommend it to Guardian of the Galaxy fans! Throw on the first two movies, build the Benatar and prepare for volume 3!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway this is just my first review that im tossing up while bored at work on a Friday afternoon.</p>

"maharage923","2021-09-25T20:45:47.25Z","New fav set","<p>I&#39;ll admit that I am&nbsp;very cynical about set reboots with slight modifications, a la the annual Millennium Falcon, X-wing, etc, but this was such a brilliant set. The 2018 version was good other than being a little small and great for the price, but that makes me like this one even more. I have long since dismantled the old one to use on my UCS Milano so it made me very happy to be able to have a Benatar built again, and even more to build and display this amazingly detailed and sleek model.</p>

<p>For the price, I really wanted at least 2 more Chitauri if one was to be included at all, especially since this new and third Chitauri design is the best yet, for the sake of making an army. The new Groot and Rocket colors are nice to see but all the minifigs were an improvement across the table. Would&#39;ve liked to have gotten a new dark bluish-gray Drax, non-white-suited Endgame Nebula, and maybe Gamora but the price is belied by the density of this build. The stand is cool, but could have been downsized in parts without losing strength, and a UCS plaque would have completed it.</p>

<p>This is the only (Marvel) set that outdid the 2012 and 2015 Quinjets for me, let alone how much more impressive this is because of the new parts and unique shape. To have done a rebooted set so soon meant it needed to be good, and this was better than I even expected. Hats off to the designers!</p>

<p>PLEASE do more Infinity Saga sets, it&#39;s a genius idea and I will be buying them all... even if they suck, haha.</p>

"Rupukka123","2021-12-07T13:33:08.117Z"," The best set of 2021? A very in-depth review","<p><em><strong>! VERY minor Endgame spoilers !</strong></em></p>

<p>This&nbsp;Benatar is pretty much an UCS set, it just doesn&#39;t have a plaque and an official UCS classification.</p>

<p>The most important part of this set in this case is the Benatar itself. You&#39;re not gonna really buy this set for the minifigures, because the build looks AMAZING!!&nbsp;Probably the best designed Marvel model&nbsp;ever, and it&#39;s pretty rare for sets in this Lego theme to look only decent. It looks much better than many modern Star Wars UCS sets do, which is a big thing!&nbsp;I have the older Benatar from 2018, and I can say that the older one looks like it was made in 2005 next to this one. It&#39;s not really that much bigger than the older one, but this&nbsp;still looks like <strong>A GIANT</strong> next to it, because now it has its correct proportions, making it a lot longer and giving it a larger wingspan. Its interior is also well-designed, and not neglected at&nbsp;all. About 70% of the extra pieces compared to the old one go straight into giving it detail, and the 30% go to giving it right proportions and for making the two engines in the back, which the older one definitely didn&#39;t have. Overall, I&#39;d give the build a straight 10/10, and it&#39;s also very accurate to the films! It is not minifig scale though, which is very understandable, because it would be like 10 times bigger. I don&#39;t mind it myself, it&#39;s easier to display too when it&#39;s not that big.</p>

<p>You can also&nbsp;set it in multiple different angles. You want it facing upward or downward? You sure can! Want it going left or right in a&nbsp;realistic&nbsp;angle? Sure! The posability of its stand is very good for posing the ship. The engines can be moved about 30 degrees on the y-axis and the engines also have 2 flaps on each engine to give it even more realistic movement poses</p>

<p>Minifigures are the main reason why I buy lego sets, most of the time. The minifigs in this are a good choice for the set, mostly. 3/5 of them are exclusive to this set.&nbsp;Since this set is based on Endgame, the appearances of the figures are the ones we saw in that film. The detail on the figures is&nbsp;what you would expect from Lego Marvel, Lacks leg printing too many times. Thor has his fat Endgame look in this set, and is not exclusive. Thor&#39;s hair colour is finally changed to dark tan after all these years, his beard also matches his hair! His Stormbreaker is still the old design, which I don&#39;t really like myself, mostly because its handle is too short. Peter now has his coat zipped up, and has a new face print, which is more accurate to Pratt&#39;s face. He also has dual moulded legs, which is amazing!&nbsp;The new teenage Groot is miles better than the 2018 one, the dark tan colour works much better, and it has like 10 times more detailed&nbsp;prints, including leg and foot printing this time. Mantis also has had an upgrade, even though it is very minor. Her torso printing has more shading and has a belt.&nbsp;This is also the first time we get rocket&#39;s Endgame look,&nbsp;If we don&#39;t include the quantum suit, of course.&nbsp;He&#39;s rocking his red scarf and his gray jumpsuit, and is&nbsp;also brown, which is much more accurate than gray. This&nbsp;set also includes a chitauri soldier, who is also not exclusive. I think&nbsp;the chitauri was a little pointless to add, but I&nbsp;still understand why they did. They did it for the kids to have some battles when playing.</p>

<p>Now some changes I&nbsp;would make to the minifigure roster, is that I&nbsp;would&nbsp;have ditched the chitauri, and added the minifigures from&nbsp;Infinity war&#39;s crew to make this the ultimate Benatar. I would&nbsp;have added Thor&#39;s and&nbsp;Rocket&#39;s&nbsp;Infinity war appearances, and also&nbsp;Gamora and Drax. Maybe even a rugged up Tony and Nebula from Endgame&#39;s first scene. Of course, I&nbsp;know why they didn&#39;t include all this,&nbsp;because of the cost and to not include everything in one. But the extra cost I would not mind because it&#39;s already ridicously underpriced. Still, they did complete the crew we had when Thor joined the guardians at the end of the film, which is a very good thing!</p>

<p>Some other changes I would have made to the set is that I would have definitely added a plaque to it, and given the engines the ability to be moved a little downwards, so you can also get an accurate look when it&#39;s landed. Overall, there were 3 things I&nbsp;would have changed, which are all very minor, so it doesn&#39;t change my rating almost at all!</p>

<p>So, this set is very underpriced, which is a very good thing. It has almost 2000 pieces and is only 150&euro;, and you can easily find it for 120-130 without it even being on sale. It&#39;s basically almost as big of a set as the UCS Slave I, but being like 100&euro; less in RRP, which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>For the last words I will say that this indeed is the best set of 2021.</p>

<p>End.</p>

"DavideMorando","2022-06-17T16:01:57.78Z","An outstanding ship, perfect for all ages.","<p>&quot;The Guardian&#39;s Ship&quot; is one of the best Marvel Super Heroes sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It consists of 1901 pieces with six minifigs that have ups and downs:<br />
-Star Lord (SH744) is almost perfect, with an amazing double-face print and&nbsp;double moulded legs. It would have been perfect with some more printing on arms/legs and if it came with his helmet;<br />
-Teen Groot (SH743) is also beautiful, with his new dark tan colour (with arm printing would have been perfect);<br />
-Mantis (SH745) and Thor (SH734) are pretty good;<br />
Rocket Raccoon (SH742) is a bit too big, maybe LEGO should a new mould, as with BD1 or Todo360;<br />
-The Chitauri (SH730)&nbsp;is an addition, to make up the number, but ok.</p>

<p>With a retail price of 149.99USD this set lacks of important figures like Drax or Nebula.</p>

<p>The build is almost perfect, with a lot of playability and the brick-built stand makes the display of this set breathtaking.</p>

<p>Overall is an amazing set and worth the money 9.5/10</p>
