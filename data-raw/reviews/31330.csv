"Zac","2022-04-03T09:24:25.55Z","Detailed design for a small set","<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">I don&rsquo;t usually buy vehicles, but after reading the Brickset interviews of Chris Stamp on 19 and 20 March 2022, I was intrigued by the sophisticated building techniques and attention to detail of the eight-stud standard Speed Champions. So yesterday I walked over to the Lego store here in Paris and bought a copy of the Koenigsegg Jesko. The building experience delighted me with its complexity, given the small size of the set, and I&rsquo;ve been pleased with the result.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Design.</b> The set abounds with impressive details: the footboards in the blue and yellow of the Swedish flag, the air intake split by a lime meat cleaver, the detachable hub caps, the distinctive rear wing, the 1x1 plate with &ldquo;Jesko&rdquo; printed on the side, and the highly accurate construction of the rear. Lime green details along the sides and beneath the wing stylishly complement the black and white body. Curves abound.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">I don&rsquo;t apply stickers, so I appreciate that Lego have designed the set so that the essential details don&rsquo;t rely on them. Although the set doesn&rsquo;t entirely capture the shape of the original vehicle&mdash;and how could it, really?&mdash;as a Lego car it&rsquo;s undeniably elegant.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">As someone new to the Speed Champions line and its foundational parts, I was intrigued by the use of offset parts. The 12x6 chassis features a well for the seats that centers five studs in the space of six. It fits two minifigures comfortably, centered in the interior and separated by one stud, in which a microphone in light grey doubles as a gear stick (or maybe something else&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know). The rear wing, at seven studs wide, is also offset using jumper plates.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The only serious problem concerns the curving white slopes at the front of the hood. Their thinness and the relative translucency of the white ABS allows the black plate underlying them to remain visible. Less seriously, it appears that the introduction of wheels that combine the tires and rims into one piece has been well-received, but I prefer assembling wheels myself.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Minifigure.</b> The Speed Champions line, as Christ Stamp noted, treats minifigures as an accessory, countering their increasingly importance in other lines. Still, the minifigure, in drab dark grey and black livery, is sadly lacking in character. Furthermore, minifigures with larger hair pieces can&rsquo;t fit under the windshield, although removing it produces an entirely serviceable convertible.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The Koenigsegg Jesko offers an appealing building experience even to those who aren&rsquo;t interested in its subject matter. Four stars.</span></span></span></p>

"tmdguru500","2022-05-01T00:38:21.853Z","Another cool car","<p>I just bought this set to add to my Speed Champions set. As this set is 7+, I took the time to get my 7-year-old son to build with me. Actually when he first opened up the set, he said that it was very similar to the green one (i.e. Lego Lotus). I think the structure is similar, but for that one he had a harder time to build especially the second part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this one, he actually built about 90% of it and he quite enjoyed it. What I liked most is the different colours for the car, which made it easier to build and also there weren&#39;t that many fancy bits, so it was quite straightforward. The only parts that I needed to finish off, was more of the cover, but nevertheless it was a good build / fun time with my son.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s another cool car, and good for a 7 year old to build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a nice little set with an interesting building process.</p>

<p>Even though the number of pieces is relatively low, it feels like you are getting a lot of car for your money.</p>

<p>Of course, you have to apply quite a lot of stickers for a set of this size, but the car does look good without the stickers applied in the first place. They add a few more details here and there but the build itself is already well detailed.</p>

<p>Some of the building techniques were fresh and exiting, like the meat cleaver in the front or the doors in general (even though they do not open).</p>

<p>A further enjoyable &quot;add-on&quot; is the minifigure. The hair- and headpiece are nothing too special but the torso and legs are looking great and show a lot of details. The big Koenigsegg logo on the back of the torso makes it feel like a suitable overall for the driver.</p>

<p>All in all, I am happy with the set, and it is permanently being displayed in my living room. This set has opened the door for many more Speed Champion sets in my collection and I would not want to miss it.</p>
