Overall they&#39;ve done a good job with it&nbsp;(it look as good as it can be considering the scale) and for a LEGO collector it&#39;s a must have (the price is not very high&nbsp;and it can be found&nbsp;on sale, at least in Romania).</p>

<p>Now, going back to the problem that made me wonder if I should buy it or not (the main issue for many LEGO fans regarding this model from what I see), the front headlights.</p>

<p>My solution was to apply stickers 14 and 10 (left) and stickers 13 and 15 (right) one next to another, to make it look like one headlight, and to skip applying the small center edge from both sides (11 and 12).</p>

<p>It is less realistic but the end result looks good.</p>

In the context of assembly, excellent; as for the car, for me, it lacked the seats, a nice dashboard, gears and some details that would give more enthusiasm to Lego lovers and collectors of miniature cars, joining the love of Lego&nbsp;with the passion of miniature collecting. Then, as I had no more space to store it in my Lego Display, I decided to innovate, I bought a box with an acetate lid (hard plastic) and it turned out really nice. In the general context note 9.</p>
