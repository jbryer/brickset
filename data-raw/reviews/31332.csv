But this one here is exceptionally special, since the Elva is an open-roof car! In addition to the details, the set features interesting recycling of parts, which I&#39;ll cover in the following.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of small parts, mostly blue, obviously, as with most SC-sets. The parts which make up the seats are printed, which is nice. The new wheels have such an incredibly small&nbsp;tyre section, they do no longer consist of a rubber tyre and a rim, but are now one part made of plastic with a thin rubber coating. I also liked the printed sound system 1x1 tile, as well as the trans-red axe blades, that are used as rear lights. Another good thing is the surprisingly small amount of stickers (seven, if i counted right)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only minifigure is a female driver. She has a helmet, a hair part and a wrench/crowbar. Her nicely printed racing suit features the McLaren logo.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty much the same as all the SC-models. Start with the big black baseplate, work your way up while adding the front and rear bumpers and so on. The abundance of small bricks might make the build longer as one would think, at least, if you have clumsy and numb fingers like moi. There are a few stickers to apply, but these are not really difficult.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model has a good resemblance to the actual super car. Especially the rear section looks pretty realistic with the narrow lights, the exhaust pipes and the stickers supporting the looks. The cockpit is simple, yet clean with printed seats and a control panel for the multimedia system. The hood is build with a hinge, so it has a slight downward slope, making it look more sportive. The headlights are made of bricks, not stickers, which looks pretty good.<br />
Unfortunately, the blue stickers do not completely match the colours of the bricks...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>LEGO has once again challenged itself, or its designers, by trying to port a very curvy, elegant sports car into LEGO bricks, which are naturally not very curvy, but rather... blocky. But, as with most Speed Champions-sets, they did a good job! Of course, the model does not look as elegant and extravagant as the actual car, but it comes close. I liked the realistic design of the rear and the wedged sidelines in particular.<br />
What kept it from getting five stars, for me, it was the colour of the stickers, which is quite off, as well as the overall failure to capture the silhouette of the car. It&#39;s difficult to describe, but the Elva is even more curvy than other super cars, at least IMHO.&nbsp;<br />
But this is still a great SC-set, which makes me wish&nbsp;for more open-roof cars, maybe&nbsp;even some Oldtimers...?</p>
