After all, how many ways can one build a race car? However, I was pleasantly surprised after building both the 1968 Corvette&nbsp;(Which is what I really bought the set for) and the C8.R Corvette; Both had a variety of different techniques for how the sides and front of the car is built.</p>

<p>The 1968 Corvette is my personal favourite of the two. The front is simple at the centre, however the sides use a variety of SNOT techniques to blend it into the curved sides of the model. The same can be said for the back of the vehicle, as the tail lights are inset into its rear. I would have liked for a boot (Trunk, for the Americans)&nbsp;that can hold the helmet, but including that would have inhibited the smoothness of the rest of the car.</p>

<p>The newer Corvette is much less smooth, and was less fun for me to build. It contains quite a few stickers, most of which are on curved bricks that make it difficult for them to but put on at the right angle. However, this model has a much more interesting build for the front and sides,&nbsp;as they contain SNOT techniques that combine different curved bricks. These curved bricks are quite clever in their execution, and make the model stand out compared to the less curved older model.</p>

<p>Overall both cars are a fun build, though challenging to apply stickers at times.&nbsp;I would recommend building with a friend or loved one at the same time, as the separate instruction booklets allow for this.&nbsp;</p>
