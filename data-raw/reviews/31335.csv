I thought the Bronco was ok, and I was&nbsp;disappointed I had to spend $50 just to get the GT. I&#39;ve had the set for a few months now, and I&#39;ve got to say the Bronco has really grown on me. I love how big it is, and it looks fantastic on display. Unsurprisingly, the GT is spectacular. Both minifigs are great. The printing on the Bronco driver is technically more impressive, but there&#39;s something about the GT driver&#39;s suit that I just love. I&#39;m thoroughly satisfied with my purchase, and I would certainly recommend this set.</p>
