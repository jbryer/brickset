I still think $80 is a ridiculous asking&nbsp;price for how much is here, but if you can find a good deal on it then I would recommend it.</p>

<p>The are plenty&nbsp;of minifigures in this set, and they&#39;re all pretty good, but LEGO could have done a better job on some of the designs, especially Batman himself. But outside of Batman, the only figure I have a real problem with is&nbsp;The Riddler, who for some reason has a full head of hair on top of his mask. He looks fine if you just remove it (and then you have a cool extra piece!), but the stickers of him still show the hair, so you can&#39;t completely avoid it. Gordon looks great though, he&#39;s my favorite out of all the figures from <em>The Batman</em>.</p>

<p>The Batcave itself was a lot of fun to build, and it&#39;s sturdier than it looks. The underground train station setting and the color scheme really make this one stand out from other Batcaves, but it still feels perfectly fitting for Batman. The pictures online make this set look a lot flatter than it actually is;&nbsp;there&#39;s just the right amount of depth from the front of the cave to the back.</p>

<p>For $80, including a few more printed pieces&nbsp;instead of stickers would have been nice, but lately&nbsp;LEGO seems reluctant to print anything except minifigures outside of 4+ sets. This set includes a couple of prints, as in&nbsp;there are literally two prints&nbsp;(the clock and Riddler&#39;s phone), but I think there could and should have been more, at least on the smaller pieces.&nbsp;There are a couple of transparent &quot;glass&quot; parts that got pretty scratched up in the box as they often do in LEGO sets, which is always disappointing. I wish those pieces could get a small bag to themselves to avoid getting so many scratches.</p>

<p>The highlight&nbsp;of the set is the train track, which can be used in at least 3 different ways. As some YouTube reviews have pointed out, the rails actually fit most standard LEGO trains, which is a really nice touch, even if there&#39;s not much railroad here for a train&nbsp;to travel on. The second way it can be used (and the main one, since this&nbsp;doesn&#39;t require any other sets) is to house the Batcomputer. In my opinion, the computer is a little oversized, but&nbsp;I like all of the little images on the monitors.&nbsp;The third function for the railroad is that you can slide the Batcomputer out and display the Batmobile in its place. This is such a cool idea, and I probably wouldn&#39;t have been convinced to buy this set if it didn&#39;t do that. The only issue is that once you move the computer out of the Batmobile&#39;s way, there&#39;s nowhere else to put it. I ended up removing the tool wall to make room for it on one side, but it doesn&#39;t fit over there very well. For a feature that&#39;s obviously intentional (it&#39;s on the back of the box), it&#39;s a shame that you can only have one of them displayed&nbsp;at a time&nbsp;when both are such iconic parts of any Batcave.</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;I like this set a lot more than I expected to when I bought it. It&#39;s not perfect but most of my complaints are nitpicks, all it really needs is a second place for the Batcomputer. The build is pretty great, and you get all but one of the minifigures from&nbsp;<em>The Batman </em>(Penguin is still exclusive to the Batmobile).&nbsp;If you&#39;re interested in picking this one up before it retires, you can probably&nbsp;find it for a lower price than the MSRP on eBay.</p>
