<p>There are a lot of small stickers in this set that are used to make up the &quot;scales&quot; of the dragon, both its red hide and white underbelly. You won&#39;t realise this at first, but the stickers all have little letter &quot;u&quot;&#39;s on them representing scales, and every sticker in the set has the &quot;u&quot;&#39;s facing the same way! You need to really look at the detail of each sticker and use some common sense (and read the instructions) to make sure you&#39;re not putting the sticker on backwards. If you apply them all correctly, you&#39;re rewarded with a continuous flow motion that looks really beautiful and adds to the natural appeal of the maroon, white, and blue protector dragon.</p>

<p>For this reason, I would also not recommend buying this set secondhand on ebay, since in addition to the usual child-placed misalignment of stickers, you are also likely to have to deal with backwards stickers even from the adults.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it&#39;s a beautiful set, the dragon is made of very interesting building techniques (although the build itself is just a tiny bit repetitive), and the pieces are beautiful. Great minifigure selection. Also, the dragon is HUGE, it&#39;s like 18 long from head to tail, and maybe more. With the parts, it&#39;s not hard to imagine making some other kind of fantasy creature, such as a nan, with these parts. And the head, which uses different parts as horns and whiskers, is a highlight of the build.</p>

<p>Anyway, I do recommend the set, just watch out for those stickers and make sure you line them up right!</p>
