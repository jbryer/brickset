"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-30T00:00:00Z","","I really (really, really, really, really, really... ou get the point) like my re-released version of this. It is quite intersting, and is one of my few models that I actually play with oftenly. Most everything else just sits around on display and is only touched every two weeks or even only once a month. (I admit I haven't played my Adventuers display, other than my Orient Expedition sets, in more than half a year. And nothing is in display cases.) On to the set itself. You can hide the treasure behind two palm leaves that swing up. If there is anything I don't like, it is the staue with hiding place inside. It just looks a bit wierd. But is still better than I could make a statue. The head is supposed to represent the mask of King Kahuka. I added a second birdge, and another level to this, but I took the other level, down, and now my only major modification is the second bridge that spans the gap between the front left corner, and the mini island in the middle. It can be raised and lowered by winch, and is operated in the back of the island by ""Magic Fingers"". I also added a network of vines, and lot more leaves. The bridge (between the two buildings) doesn't fall, rather, when you rewmove a pin, it swings. Specially decorated pieces (excluding the minifigs) are the animal skin drum, some of the wall pieces, the sail, the baseplates and the shields. THIS IS A GREAT SET, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will not be disappointed by buying this. That is nearly a guarantee. Once again, A WHOLE LOT O' FUN!!!!!!!!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-31T15:51:45Z","Indigo Island","This is one of LEGO's all-time greatest sets. If you see this set, I would recommend attempting to purchase it. The figures are all high quality, with two Pirates in a rowboat and five Islnaders, with a canoe provided for them. There are also a number of creatures on the island, for example the crocodile, the parrot and the monkey. All of the features of the set are well-modelled, and it is very easy to imagine the Islanders on such a place. There are two main &quot;hut&quot; buidlings, one of which is made of trees, the other hewn out of a cave into the rock. Both of these use the wooden ladder sections so that the islanders can gain easy access to the upper levels. Two palm trees and widespread usage of the jungle tree elements give the entire place a very tropical feel to it, making it an authentic-feeling set. On the far left of the set is a drum, which looks very real and is in a good position. On the right-hand side is a giant statue which is very reminiscent of those found on Easter Island. This theme is also carried on through the Islanders sub-theme, giving it an feel of continuity. I give this set the maximum score possible any time!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T19:54:05Z","Tropical Treasure","   This is a great set!  The palm fronds make convincing thatched hut roofs. The tribal drum brick is another realistic looking piece.  The giant statue helps to give the feel of a tribe in a jungle or a rainforest.  Speaking of which, the little cell can hold treasure, or marauding pirates.  (I attached my Crocodile Cage to this set so my statue now houses sacred Islander stuff.)  The balcony is very nice, and the fronds trailing off help reinforce that &quot;jungle&quot; feel.  (I'm not sure how Islanders would make a balcony though, or how sturdy it would be)  The bridge smacks slightly of an Indiana Jones stunt.  I think some LEGO creepers trailing off it would be a nice touch.  The catamaran is very nice, and the stickers give it a painted look.  All in all, a excellent place for the Indigo Islanders to live.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-27T12:25:15Z","Indigo Island ","I have finally managed to obtain this set, and it is as good as I thought that it would be. It has several nice features in it, for example the drum, and it has places to hide treasure and for the Islanders to live. It is quite a realistic set, for example the ladders which allow the Islanders to climb from one platform to another. There are 5 Islanders in this set and 2 Pirates, with a rowboat for the Pirates and a canoe for the Islanders. The statue on the right-hand side of the island also doubles as a prison for Pirates. I think that this set is in the top ten of all sets that LEGO have ever made. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-24T01:01:17Z","a good place to hide your treasure. ","I like this large pirate(or islanders)island it has a small cave that you can hide your treasure too.It also has a cool bridge that when you pull a pin it spins to the side(beware it takes a little work to make it work sometime.The bridge is connected to a little hut like place with an attic and under the little hut is a place for shelter.Theres also a kings balcony which is neat.Last thing the stone statue has cool place to hide pirates or islanders. do you agree that new legos are pretty much junk?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T12:37:09Z","The Best Islander Set!! :)","I bought this set in 2001 when it was re-released as a lego legend set. It was the most anticipated set that I wanted that year. It was also the first islander set I've gotten. The whole set was perfect. It's the perfect base for your pirates and islanders. Who will take the Islanders' treasure? You decide!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Mikes","2006-11-07T17:15:20Z","Awesome Set!","I agree with it being in the top ten. You have to get this set. It has a lot of cool pieces. Right when I saw a picture of it, I wanted it. I finally got it on ebay and wanted to get more islanders sets. I think the Pirate series and Islander sub-series should return.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-30T01:40:04.077Z","Islanders at their best.","This is a great set, filled with detail and interesting little features.  There is a statue with a hiding place (either for treasure or for imprisoning pirates), a rope bridge which can be made to tip anyone crossing it over, some nicely-designed boats and a plethora of weapons, equipment and little touches such as one of those nice-looking animal-skin drums.  It's a shame the Islanders sets never came with a cooking pot big enough for putting pirates and intrepid explorers in, but that's just a minor gripe.  Well worth finding.

"MPH","2009-04-20T15:41:51.043Z","Bigger is not always better","Well, well, the Enchanted Island. A very 'bombastic' set, covering no less than two 32x32 baseplates (one of them 3D), with two palm trees, two boats and seven minifigs. ""Big, bigger, biggest"" seems to be the motto for this set, and at first sight it is no let down: a very colorful set with lots of features and accessories.

Unfortunately, a closer look reveals its serious flaws... As noted by other reviewers, this set is just a mish-mash of thrown-together pieces representing 'buildings' - a sincere pity, as the islanders have shown to be capable of some stunning architecture (6262 and 6264). The only part that really shines is the statue, but it almost seems as if the designers spent so much time on it, that they had to rush the rest of the set. I mean, the palm leafed roofs of the buildings aren't even symmetric! Was it that hard to copy the wonderful roof of 6264?

In my opinion the Islanders deserve a greater flagship set than this one. Yes, it's huge, but sometimes less is more. Every other Islander set, from the small 6236 to the magnificent 6264, stands out with great colors, elegant design and perfect use of baseplates. Sure, the colors are here too, but that's about it.

"OWF","2008-09-03T17:07:20.873Z","In TOP 10 from all time","This set is simply magnificent.
Before to buy it I tried to build it for so many times using different pieces and when at last I bought it and built it I just said: &quot;This is it&quot;
As time as there are no disadvantages and only qualities, I will just try to enumerate several of them.

The baseplate has some unique style, if you get another 2 of them, you can create a beautiful lagoon.
The bridge between two towers improve the structure of their &quot;fortress&quot;.
The statue is also beautiful and it was a surprise to discover there's islanders jail.
All minifigs are gorgeous, islanders soldiers, the chief, the girl and the pirates.
There is also a parrot, a crocodile and a monkey.

This set is a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:49:20.89Z","The mother of all islanders sets","Without a doubt, this is the mother of all the islanders sets. It was the biggest in existence, and it still is revolutionary. It is very good that it was re-released in 2001, this set is just brilliant. It has loads of options, including the terrific bridge that can tilt. The statue is just amazing, as is the door behind it, so you can put somebody in there. Both boats have sails, for long-distance travels. If you can get hold of this set, go get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TristanC","2010-07-05T23:08:03.83Z","Overall one of the best sets I've ever seen","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite sets of all time. It is the largest of any of the Islanders sets and still has excellent design and detail. Has many minifigs including Chief Kahuna, Islander soldiers and girl, and two pirates. The thing that I think I like most about this set is all of the details. These include a small waterfall, a cave hidden by palm leaves, a secret door in the back of the statue revealing a small jail, animal skin drum, many parts, lots of animals, a small island, and many more. I cannot see any flaws in it and is a great set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Ernst","2011-07-12T18:32:23.16Z","A Tropical Surprise","<p>What a beautiful set this is, really the top model of the Islanders theme. It really deserves 5 bricks for all aspects, without exaration in my opinion. If you collect the Pirates series this is&nbsp;a must have !!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building is a nice but not&nbsp;the&nbsp;easiest job, you have to look very good where to place the small&nbsp;parts. But a good feeling when you are almost&nbsp;finished and a great result when you place the bridge to connect both plates. Like in all my reviews again happy with all small bricks, it is real building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are all wonderfull : the 2 great baseplates, the 2 boats both with sails, the statue with turnable head and jail, the bridge, 7 great minifigures, the animals&nbsp;and so on. Absolutely nothing is missing !! A bonus brick for the colourfull design of this theme as shown on both the sail and the Islanders shields. Also worth mentioning are the walls with the plants and leaves on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability is great ! You have all playing elements you need : 2 opposite parties, lots of space, hiding places, 2 boats, a jail. My son of 5&nbsp;enjoys playing with this set and I love to look at it and sneaky play with it too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for money is for me really worth the 5 bricks because I paid a lot less then the average value Bricklink offers. It is estimated on an average price of &euro;54,00 which I would pay for it if I had to buy it to complete the serie. If you like the theme and can buy it for less my advise would be : grab it and enjoy !!</p>

"Chris_Diehl","2012-03-22T00:46:19.86Z","A set that rivals the coolness of a castle set","<p>Considering that there are plenty of other reviewers out there and most of the sets I have are 15+ years old, my reviews are going have a much different angle to them versus a build straight out of a sealed box from the store. Maybe this style may actually help someone in a similar situation, or just be an entertaining read about the durability and uniqueness of its parts. My criteria will be more based upon survivability of a set after being built, played with, disassembled, and its parts reused in multiple other configurations as many kids will do. Next will be my ability to find its parts that have been stored in a Rubbermaid tub for over a decade, and to see what wear and tear may have affected it. Keep in mind that I have over 50 sets stored in multiple containers where they have remained for 10-15 years. I have also somewhat sorted them out as best I can to speed up the part search process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is one of the last sets I ever received as a gift before I went to high school and was ""too old"" to be given Legos ever again (sniffle).&nbsp; I had been given numerous other sets including technics, multiple space &amp; town as well as many pirate sets but this was definitely the largest I ever had.&nbsp; Other than my Dark Dragon's Den or Lagoon Lock Up, I had plenty of boats and wagons and minifigs but not many bases for them to play on.&nbsp; This changed all that and I finally had a place for all my characters to war on.&nbsp; Lots of unique pieces like the rope bridge, base plates, &nbsp;animals like the croc, monkey &amp; parrot, and the awesome islanders themselves including the king Kahuka himself &amp; his mask.&nbsp; It also goes surprisingly well with the other islander sets like the Forbidden Cove and King Kahuka's Throne and can make for a mock Easter Island type setup.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finding the pieces for this set wasn't bad as most are fairly large and spotting the black &amp; read columns or black corner panels isn't hard.&nbsp; The painted grey corner panels (yay no decals!) and various greenery are easy to spot too.&nbsp; The various horns and headdresses can be a real pain to find after many years and may tend to turn up missing (one of the few things I've had a lot turn up missing).&nbsp; Surprisingly the decals on the boats managed to stay attached so I can't complain there.&nbsp; Overall pretty easy build and no problem to find the necessary parts in a big pile.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Large area for minifigs battles even if the small rooms don't allow much internally</li><li>Very colorful and the usage of all of the palm fronds really makes it a nice set to look at</li><li>With the exception of the boats, there aren't any decals as most parts are painted instead</li><li>Tons of cool minifigs and animals for your collection</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The ""rooms"" of the base are pretty tiny and are pretty much for show only</li><li>The high amount of bone &amp; headdress as decorations pretty much guarantees that some will turn up missing over time</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the part sizes are medium or bigger and are pretty standard so there shouldn't be much if any at all getting lost or misplaced over time.&nbsp; Tons of external space &amp; many cool minifigs make this a perfect battleground for your pirates, islanders and possibly even Imperials.&nbsp; Due to their small nature and less than sturdy attachment, many of the decorative pieces may become dislodged or even lost over time, but for the most part this is a minor issue.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SirSven7","2012-01-09T21:14:55.653Z","Lego Steve's review","<span style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">Here
 we have the flagship for the Islander theme, the Enchanted Island. This
 set is somewhat reminiscent of The Imperial Trading post, as they both 
come on two 32 x 32 stud Baseplates, they both contain two boats, they 
both have a number of structures rather than one and they are both the 
main sets of that faction. I am lucky enough to have both here in front 
of me whilst I write, and I have to say I love them both. <br><br>The problem I 
have is that I can see the flaws with this set far easier than I can 
with its counterpart, for example, the bridge is placement. We have a 
beautiful printed river but the design of the set&nbsp;is such that the 
bridge just goes next to it rather than over (that’s just stupid). 
Another problem I have&nbsp;is with&nbsp;the structure that the bridge is 
connected to, it seems to be there for no reason, it’s not a hut, or a 
storehouse or a lookout post, or anything, it’s just a building that’s 
sole purpose is to have the bridge connected to it. <br><br>Despite these flaws I
 still love the set, we see a beautiful fireplace and pot (for the 
island girl to use obviously) I nice statue (which also doubles as a 
jail) a cool small canoe and a brilliant pirate jolly boat with two 
sails (the one at the front is exclusive to this set). The set is 
interesting and original and just like the trading post is somewhere for
 a pirate ships to attack and loot (though the islanders armed spears 
and bows would probably struggle against cannons and muskets), though I 
feel that the pirates would attack this place for the croc meat and 
Island girl (that’s where the Wenches come from) rather than the gold.<br><br></span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"Alonzo_Brickovsky","2015-11-18T13:31:45.323Z","Paradise, classic-style","<p>I&#39;m writing this review from a certain (not to say biased) point of view. This set comes from the period when I was involved in Lego the most,&nbsp;as a child.&nbsp;In 1994 it was simply unimaginable for me to afford it, all I could get was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6236-1/King-Kahuka"">6236: King Kahuka</a>&nbsp;when it comes to Islanders. Many of you probably can imagine what it felt like, when after 21 years, as an adult fan, I managed to buy sealed set! At 150 EUR it wasn&#39;t even that sick kind of price - when you think about classic Pirates. I shot dozens of pictures and I&#39;d like to share some of them as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typically for the mid-1990s, it&#39;s the kind of box with lid, under which some of the most interesting parts are displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/580/22325487566_369777a345_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;463&quot;"" /></p>

<p>So, even unopened it reveals much of what&#39;s inside, especially considering that the back shows some&nbsp;inspiring alternate builds (again, typically for the period). After unboxing, the contents look&nbsp;as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/22325501406_46f783be4a_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;453&quot;"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, apart from instructions there is also the 1994&nbsp;catalogue, Lego Service book (which is some kind of offline,&nbsp;pre-Pick-a-Brick solution I wasn&#39;t aware of so far) and... yes, only four stickers for the canoe. They certainly lost some of their stickiness but were still usable after 20 years!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is mostly what I bought it for. You get two printed, colourful baseplates (one flat, one raised), two boats, the whole jungle of leaves and trees, rope bridge, flags, monkey, parrot, crocodile and a lot more. You can&#39;t really use price per piece ratio when you look at this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5722/22163788488_0a636a447e_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;233&quot;"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is a complete Islanders line-up with their King, his bow-armed spouse and three natives. There are also two pirates with weapons. Which honestly&nbsp;leaves little to be desired. The only drawback for me is <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/pi022/Pirate-Shirt-with-Knife-Black-Leg-with-Peg-Leg-Black-Pirate-Hat-with-Skull"">Captain Red Beard</a>&nbsp;who is less interesting than his 1989 <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/pi055/Captain-Red-Beard-with-Pirate-Hat-with-Skull"">counterpart</a>.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>No surprises here. No advanced techniques. Parts are quite large, so the main building rises up quickly. You have to&nbsp;try hard not to haste too much! However, remember that the instructions doesn&#39;t use so many steps as modern ones do.&nbsp;Plus there is no selection of parts in the corner, so you have be careful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Fabulous. Simply wonderful.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/22302713379_a2f6fc263d_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;340&quot;"" /></p>

<p>The most interesting structures are the main one, raised on 3D baseplate and Kahuka-like one on the right, which also serves as a prison:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/631/21867590173_9fdfdf7924_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;"" /></p>

<p>There is just enough space for each boat, animal and&nbsp;minifigure. The level of detail&nbsp;may not be astonishing for a spoiled a.d. 2015&nbsp;AFOL, but...&nbsp;it&#39;s not 1000-piece&nbsp;set after all.&nbsp;The model&#39;s size and playability are&nbsp;more than satisfying though.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A highly recommended set, not only for classic Pirates afficionados. Many of included here parts are either&nbsp;rare or&nbsp;discontinued long ago.&nbsp;Apart from printed tiles and panels, animals,&nbsp;baseplates and minifigures, other&nbsp;hard to find pieces from <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/sets/6278-1/enchanted-island-islanders-1994"">this lot</a> are for example:<br />
- sail parts (<a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/4318"">4318</a>, <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/4319"">4319</a>)<br />
- panels (<a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/4444"">4444</a>)<br />
- <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/2518"">10x5 palm leaf</a><br />
- <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/2536"">palm trunk</a><br />
and many other, born-to-be-MOC&nbsp;parts. To conclude, I&#39;m really happy to own it in mint condition (as opposed to my other childhood sets) and it&#39;s quite refreshing after buying only 2014/2015 sets for some time!</p>

"ProfessorPiranha","2016-05-01T16:45:28.383Z","Excellent, Lovely Looking, Vintage Set","<p>This is a very nice looking set from the pirate series released in 1994, probably one of my favourite sets that I own. It looks spectacular, and is great to play with or use as a display piece</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box looks wonderful, as do most of the boxes from vintage Lego sets, the sunset background adds to how nice it looks. I feel that there is some kind of charm to the look of older, vintage sets and their boxes that you don&#39;t really get nowadays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set comes with some very good, and some unique parts. For example, the rock pieces with vine printing. However the pieces that probably stand out the most are the base&nbsp;plates. Both are green with printed sand and river patterns, and one is raised and one is flat. I may be wrong, but i do not think that these bases come in any other sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Pirate minifigures&nbsp;have very nice printing, but aren&#39;t really unique, and you could get them in any of the vintage pirate sets. The Islanders look very nice, they come with printed shields and there are a variety, including&nbsp;men and women, different face paint, and different head&nbsp;wear. This set comes with 8&nbsp;minifigures (including a monkey) which is a good amount.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set is very fun to build. There are a lot of pieces included, which means it won&#39;t just take 5 minutes to complete, so the experience will be better. The only complaint I would have is not specifically for this set, but for the instructions&nbsp;of older sets as a whole. These days&nbsp;instruction booklets will tell you which pieces you need for each page. However they do not in this set and you can easily miss something and have to work your way back through the booklet to find where the piece goes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed build looks amazing, it is very large, but that is definitely a good thing in this case. There are many options for positioning figures and a great display piece. I also found that this set looks very good when placed with other sets, especially others sets from the old pirate series and the adventurers series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I feel that this is a great set. The figures are good, it&#39;s fun to build, comes with some great parts, and overall just looks amazing. Since it is discontinued, it could cost quite a bit to buy, especially if you want it in the box with the instructions, but if you like the look of it, you should definitely try and look out for a good deal.</p>
