Across the subtheme minifigures are excellent and largely exclusive, but the sets are designed for play of a sort that adults are less likely to undertake&mdash;rolling and jumping dirt bikes and monster trucks up ramps, through hoops, across cars, and so on. I bought 60296 Wheelie Stunt Bike mostly for the minifigure, but also with some curiosity about the flywheel function. Production problems appear to have sharply limited their availability, and I had to buy mine from a third-party seller.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Minifigure.</b> The minifigure exceeded my expectations. She&rsquo;s superb in what looks to be a green leopard-print leotard and a magenta jacket. The back of the torso improves on the front, with a floating eye and other arcane symbols on the jacket. In her alternate expression, she cheekily sticks her tongue out, an echo of the skull and bones printed on the front of her dirt bike, also with its tongue sticking out. I&rsquo;m pleased that she comes with a helmet: safety is important even for minifigures.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Functions.</b> The flywheel of the dirt bike works effectively. When one rolls it along a flat surface and lets go the bike goes much farther than a comparable non-flywheel model. The back of the box suggests rolling it forward three times quickly before letting go, and this provides a higher velocity and comparably longer range. I haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out how far it can go because no place in my house has proved long enough: its range exceeds my maximum testing length of about fifteen meters.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Aiming the bike requires a bit of practice but can be done reliably once one has the hang of it. It can travel over short carpet, and up and down ramps. The wheel doesn&rsquo;t stop spinning if the bike collides with something and it balances fairly well, so it will change direction after a collision and continue on a new trajectory. The dirt bike has a set of smaller wheels off the back that allows it to do a wheelie, currently a unique feature within the subtheme, and it indeed works, although one must be careful in balancing it while starting the bike. At low velocities it does list to the right as a result of slight asymmetries in the flywheel component.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">I had expected to try out the dirt bike only briefly to get a sense of its functions, but it&rsquo;s a great deal of fun! My mother and I&mdash;and she&rsquo;s even less the intended audience than I&mdash;spent quite some time rolling it back and forth on difference surfaces, among obstacles, and up ramps. I bought 43105 Party Llama Beatbox at the same time, again for the minifigure, and by comparison the Stuntz subtheme has all the virtues that Vidiyo lacks. It&rsquo;s ready for play immediately out of the box and accessible to all audience, it offers good value, it&rsquo;s enjoyable on its own or with other Legos or anything else one happens to have lying around.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">60296 offers good fun to people of all ages. Four stars.</span></span></span></p>
