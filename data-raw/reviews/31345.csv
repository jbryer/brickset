<p>This was released along with most of the Lego City Stuntz series on 1st October 2021.&nbsp; Within the &pound;6.99 box you get 14 parts, containing a new motorbike and a great looking Minifigure.&nbsp; In total there are six new Stuntz bikes in this theme in varying styles and colours.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The box for this set brings back memories of Kellogg&#39;s variety packs from when I was a lot younger.&nbsp; On the front it has a great image of the bike and rider pulling a wheelie while waving at his adoring fans.&nbsp; The image on the box is slightly bigger than the actual bike.&nbsp; The Stuntz logo at the bottom stands out well in front of the ripped&nbsp;element showing a bright orange underneath.</p>

<p>The back of the box has a QR code that takes you to the Lego City page at lego.com.&nbsp; It also contains two images that show you how to make the bike go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the top of the box there is a 1:1 image of Rocket Racer.</p>

<p>Inside the box is one bag containing all the parts and a folded instruction sheet.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The Minifigure included with this set is Rocket Racer.&nbsp; I personally did not know of his legendary status, but seeing comments since his release I realise that he is quite a special inclusion.&nbsp; His head, torso and the helmet he wears are all currently unique to this set.&nbsp; The legs are unprinted white ones.</p>

<p>The head is only printed on one side, however the torso is printed on front and back and has one bright blue and one bright red arm, both with white gloves.&nbsp; This torso is very striking and suits this type of character perfectly.&nbsp; The transparent red visor keeps the red, white and blue theme going well too.&nbsp; Also included is a dark brown hair element.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The build is only eight parts, and we are used to how to put the bikes together so no surprises there.&nbsp; The new elements that make the bike won&#39;t fit with existing ones unfortunately, but as there is a mechanism to make the bike go that can be forgiven.&nbsp; The back wheel comes attached and cannot be removed.&nbsp; It is worth stating that the rear wheel is quite a bit smaller than the front.&nbsp; The official images do well to hide this.</p>

<p>When built the flame coming out of the back, to me, looks a bit strange.&nbsp; I therefore did a minor change and put a bright blue 1x1 cheese slope in the place of the clip and pushed the clip back.&nbsp; I then changed the flame to one more befitting of the status of Rocket Racer.&nbsp; It now looks like the flame has a source - see the image below.</p>

<p>Also, the new bike parts seem to elevate the rider a bit too much.</p>

<p>There are three new bike fairings for this line in six different guises, and this particular superbike shape&nbsp;only comes in this set.&nbsp; The fairing is printed and there are no stickers in the set at all.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Although there are a couple of&nbsp;things that stop this set getting five stars, they are only minor and the play value is fantastic.&nbsp; My son was able to get the bike to travel the full length of the living room and the stability is pretty good as there is a low clearance that keeps the bike upright.&nbsp; I gave the bike three quick pushes and held it up and the wheel kept turning for 20 seconds.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait to get the others in this series - especially the Chicken - and I would certainly recommend getting this if you can.&nbsp; If the price was &pound;1 less I could see it selling a lot more.</p>

When looking at the Rocket Stunt Bike, I had a few thoughts.&nbsp;<br />
First, I&#39;m going to talk about the actual bike. The&nbsp;actual bike is themed around blue, red and white, and for the bike, the main colour is blue with a flame on the side, and the two letters, maybe standing for rocket rider? The bike also has a flame coming out of the back, and is a nice detail but seems out of place.&nbsp;<br />
Now the guy. The guy is also themed around red white and blue, with the flaming RR on his chest. The guy has different coloured arms, which is interesting and different from most guys. He has a helmet for when biking with a blue strip on top and a hair set for when not biking. With the hair on he has a strong resemblance to the Lego City Adventures character Tippy Doorman.<br />
Overall I liked the set and found it enjoyable, but felt the&nbsp;guy was more interesting than the bike. &nbsp;If you want a set to play, this set is good, but you might want to get something with a ramp. However, this isn&#39;t a great display set, unless you have your eyes set on the set.&nbsp;</p>
