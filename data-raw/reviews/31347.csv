<p>The minifigure is fine. It&#39;s a bit generic but comes with a helmet in a lovely shade of dark red.</p>

<p>Animals:</p>

<p>You get two monkeys and a scorpion with this set which is pretty good in my opinion. The monkeys are able to hold things and can attach&nbsp;multiple ways to the provided tree. The scorpion is ok but provides good play value.</p>

<p>Tree:</p>

<p>The provided tree is fine, but I think it should have been extended a bit to make it taller. This modification is easy enough to make, however, and the tree has a variety of good vantage points for the monkeys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ATV:</p>

<p>The ATV is nice as the wheels can move slightly from side to side, a feature that is great for play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drone:</p>

<p>The drone looks nice for its simplicity and comes with a cool camera accessory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Thoughts:<br />
I like this set and I think it provides pretty good play value for its price.&nbsp;<br />
