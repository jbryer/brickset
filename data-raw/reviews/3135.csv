"StormSworder","2008-03-26T13:48:11.06Z","Pirates at their best.","As far as Pirate bases/hideouts go, this has to be the best.  The main model is interesting and well-designed, comes with battlements, a crane, a bar/map-room and a skyll-shaped rock which can be tilted to one side to allow a rowing boat access into a tunnel.  There are also plenty of weapons, pirate minifigs, a cannon and plenty of treasure.

"BasiltheBatlord","2009-02-14T15:32:01.717Z","The pirate's hideout ","This set is Redbeard's pirate base, and that alone counts for a lot. The skull tunnel is excellent, and of course, it's how the set got it's name. The little dock with the cannon is a very nice touch, and the bar/map room with the rumm bottle is perfect. I always imagined that the crane is for moving redbeard's smuggled goods. It's also great to have imperial guards that oppose the pirates, but I have heard that the set's release date was during a time when different imperials were being sold. My favourite thing about this set is that there are just so many hidden trap doors, weapons, and treasures. Now on to the mini figuire review:

"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:52:17.717Z","Very Nice Set","This is an old school, mostly brick-built set (only two burps are used). It's definitely worth picking up this enjoyable set if you can. It was a bit overpriced when it came out, though it can be gotten cheaply enough on ebay if you keep an eye out for it. The color scheme is a nice light grey, black, and red, with accents of green, yellow and brown (I especially like the the red and black railing on the top level). Unfortunately there's only one canon in this set, but other details make up for this, including there being a nice ten inch by ten inch blue baseplate, two boats (red and brown), and 6 minifigures. 

There's also lots of nice little details to this set, such as a monkey, a parrot, lots of barrels, a crane, two guns hidden behind a bush, plenty of weapons, four oars, and six canon balls. Another thing I like about this set is that it has ladders to all levels and areas of the set. In some sets it's as though you have to make superhuman leaps to get from one level to another. 

The use of the hammer to hold one of the bushes in place is interesting, though not particularly helpful as a building technique. As far as the skull goes, I've seen different people call it good and bad, but I fall somewhere in the middle... I think it's ok, but not much above average. The skull opens up as an entrance to... a cave? Well, to somewhere. In the cave area is a nicely made place for a treasure chest. Also, on one level of the set is a table with a map and a cup and a bottle. You can flip this up to reveal some secret weapons underneath. Of course you'd knock everything off the table by accessing the weapons in real life, but it's still a point of interest. 

I'd give this set an 85/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legomakes3","2009-07-19T11:59:30.95Z","1st Vintage Set!","A LEGO fan of today knows that ALTHOUGH there are so many great sets to buy now, there were also amazingly good sets in the years before these modern fans were born! This comes into play for me, too.

The Skull Island was made in 1995, when I wasn't born yet. What made me fall in love with this Pirates set is that there are so many mini-figures for a collectionist like me (6!). 2 Red-coated Imperials and 4 pirates. ""I have to get it,"" I said to myself.

Now, I knew the only way I could get the set was through a marketplace. So I chose the wonderful BrickLink to find my set. Looking through the many stores that sold Skull Island, I found one great store that was selling the set, complete!, for $52. This was 1 dollar less than the original price of the set when it was released in '95! Waiting until my graduation, I made sure to look everyday to make sure the set was still there! And by July 11, the day I purchased the set, it was still there!

The seller was great and a fast shipper! I almost fainted when I saw the UPS box on my porch, knowing that package was all mine!

It only took me 25 minutes to build the set, so I made a pros and cons list about the beauty of Skull Island!

PROS

*1995 set in great condition!
*Cherrishable mini-figs!
*32 x 32 baseplate is HUGE!
*Non-shooting cannon!
*Two boats! Brown for pirates, and red for soldiers!
*Spinable and buildable skull
*Imperials!
*Builable tree!
*Just so GREAT!

CONS

*Only 2 Imperials! I love Imperials, so I wished there would have been 3 or 4!

This is my 1st vintage set, and I have to state, everybody in my house think it is the best LEGO set we own!

""A pirate's life for me...""

P.S. The seller from BrickLink, Dearly De-Parted, is someone you should go for, for all your LEGO needs! She was EXCELLENT!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-19T04:34:15.763Z","LEGO Pirates - Skull Island Review","This is a very cool set which I got for Christmas years ago. We get 6 minifigs in total and no stickers which you have to worry about. And you also get some neat play features. The minifigs we get in this set are the pirate captain, 2 British soldiers and 3 pirates. This set also includes a monkey and a palm tree. There're also two rafts in this set. We get a red and a brown raft.<br><br>The set is very fun to build and very sturdy. On the dock we get a cannon which sviwels full 360° and it does really shoot like a flick-missile if you put in the black cylinder pieces which are supposed to be the cannon balls. We get a keg, a ladder and a barrier on the dock as well. The main building is awsome. The huge skull does open and the rafts can pass the canal. In the inside you can see a treasure chest which has some gold in the inside and the other side has two rifles in there.<br><br>The first level of this building has a desk for the pirates which has a bottle, a map and a yellow chalice. There's also a floor which can disappear and underneath that floor are two swords. The balcony on the top has 3 kegs, a huge pirate flag and a crane. I really can't complain about this set and it's a nice Christmas present for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"SirSven7","2012-01-09T21:17:39.803Z","Lego Steve's Review","The flagship of 1995 came in the form of another pirate base, at this point
in the theme we have seen a total of three pirate bases, but because the other
two were released in 1989 and 1991 respectively we can forgive Lego for the
repetition, (we get the old Captain back as well which is great). <br><br>This set is
nice in the way that the structure relies less on being an island and more on
being a&nbsp;base in its own right, the skull at the front looks good and I
like the way it can be moved to store the boat but I am reminded of the
Forbidden Cove 6264, because the idea is exactly the same. The crane and top
floor of this set is probably the nicest part (I love the railings), the whole
structure of the set looks good&nbsp;because it is well thought out. <br><br>The set is
interesting,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I am not sure which pirate base is my favourite,
this set doesn’t have the beautiful classic vibe of the original set, and
Redcoats are not quite as good as the Bluecoats (and we don’t get a sail this
time), but the structure is more interesting and its nice to have a strong
pirate structure for the Imperials to attack rather than the other way round.<br><br><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"MatthewLM","2014-02-07T19:32:40.843Z","Now I wanna buy some ships and have a pirate battle.","<p>Man, I remember in 1995 when this set came out. I was five years old. I tried to get my mother to get it for me, but we didn&#39;t have a lot of money, so I was bummed. And you can see why I was disappointed. Skull Island. A cool little base with a revolving skull that reveals a hideout with a crane, cannon and two boats. Why wouldn&#39;t want it?</p>

<p>Flash-forward 18 years later and with some Christmas money I purchased this set on eBay and I have to say, I was not disappointed one bit.</p>

<p>Building it is simple. Just start off with the boats and then the Island itself. You might be confused as to where to put the bricks at on the baseplate, but once you figure it out, it&#39;s simple from there on.</p>

<p>Now onto the set itself. The Skull Island is a nice idea. I believe the skull itself warns people about who dwells there and is the neatest decoration on the base. And you can revolve it to reveal a hideaway with a treasure chest and two mounted rifles to shoot at invading ships.&nbsp; But that&#39;s not all. You also have a little dock with a cannon on there. Honestly I think the two imperial guards are outmatched. The pirate can just aim it at their dinky boat and blow them out of the water. But I&#39;ll get onto the figures in a moment. You have a palm tree alongside a middle part where you can look at a map and take a swig of rum and plan some pirate schemes. And the top part is a balcony where you can take a look at the surroundings around the island. And also have a crane where you can lower a barrel of jewels and row it on a pirate boat so if the Imperials take it over, you be darn sure that won&#39;t get the jewels. Just hope they don&#39;t forget the treasure chest as well.</p>

<p>The figures include two Imperials guards, which one is the commander I think, with the black tricorn hat and beard. At least I like to think of him as a higher up. And you have a foot soldier as well. And all on a tiny boat. I imagine this action scene where the cannon blows them out of the water, but they survive and fight off the prates ala Schwarzenegger in <em>Commando</em>. On the pirate side is the cannon man with the black and orange tank top with blue pants, a black tricorn hat and an eye patch. I just hope he has no problem with depth perception. You have another eye patched guy with a tricorn hat, blue jacket and gray pants. That pirate design is one of my favorites. And you have the guy with the red rag, mustache, tanktop and black pants. Looks like a scruffy dude who will hold his own against the Imperials. And last but not least, you have the famous Captain Redbeard, large and in charge. He may not have an eye, a hand or a leg, but he sure as heck won&#39;t go down without a fight. And as an added bonus, you have a monkey. And monkeys are always neat. And a parrot as well. I just wish there was a way to put him on the fearsome Captain&#39;s shoulder. With everything, one thing that&#39;s missing are some ships, like an Imperial flagship, with one released in 1992 I believe. The Skull Island guys will fight with there lives and fight hard.</p>

<p>But by itself, this is a neat set and if you&#39;re a Lego fan, this is a must-have.</p>

"Classic_Brick_Studios","2021-12-05T17:09:22.29Z","Under Jolly Roger...","<p><em>Near a forgotten little group of islands, lies a land of green that is seemingly uninhabited. But as one enters these palm forests he&#39;ll soon find himself in a quiet lagoon and in front a giant skull. Skull Island, the nest of the most feared pirate group in the Caribbean, Captain Roger Redbeard and his gang of cutthroats. Two unfortunate soldiers of the Imperial Guard have now run into this pirate paradise and their lives are on the line! Who will leave this island alive? We are about to find out...</em></p>

<p>Now for this review I have chosen a set that has been in my collection quite some time, but wasn&#39;t part of my childhood in any way, shape or form. Actually I never had this set on my radar when I came back from my dark ages. I knew I wanted to collect 90s sets and this was a set I just looked at one time and thought &quot;yeah I put it on the list for later&quot;.</p>

<p>However just a few days later I entered a small second hand LEGO store in my hometown to buy the 6278 Enchanted Island they had prominent in their store window. So I was prepared to shell out 120 Euros for that set, however in a refreshing twist the set only cost 70 (way less than I expected). However, I still had 50 bucks, I planned to spend that day and as fortune would have it, the store also had the Skull Island, though not as well displayed for I think 48. So I did what had to be done, did not hesitate, showed no mercy aaaaaand went home with both sets for a mere 120 bucks. Nice!</p>

<p>As I built the set, I really came around to enjoying it more than I initially thought and want to share some of that enjoyment with you now...</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The pirate sets almost always had excellent figure selections and this set is no different. We get a handful of pirates and their leader, the infamous Roger Redbeard. I love these figures and in terms of detail they may be dated, but are still all that I need a minifigure to be. (even though I appreciate the amount of details LEGO Figures nowadays have)</p>

<p>Furthermore, we get two soldiers of the crown to fight the pirates, though I doubt they stand much of a chance in this set.</p>

<p>Nice selection, I love it!</p>

<p><strong>The Dingis</strong></p>

<p>Do I need to talk about them in detail? There are two boats and if you own any pirate sets, you probably have at least one of these. They are nice though, and I can see the value of their inclusion, though at this point I have amassed a fleet of these.</p>

<p><strong>Skull Island</strong></p>

<p>Now we get to the meat and potatoes. As far as I can see this set hasn&#39;t appreciated quite as much as most other pirate sets from these years and I really can&#39;t think of a reason why that is. It&#39;s fantastic.</p>

<p>So we have a spacious dock area with a cannon for action scenes, which is nice. Then we come to the giant skull, which obviously gives the set its name. It is nicely build and swings wide open to give access to a cave that can be entered by boat. I like this feature very much. It should also be noted that the whole set rests on a 32x32 blue baseplate and is fully build up, no 3D baseplate, so for those of you who don&#39;t enjoy 3D plates (which I really like) there you go, this is a set for you.</p>

<p>On the second floor we have the captain&#39;s quarters with a small table that has a treasure map and what I can only assume would be cherry juice on it. Minifigures wouldn&#39;t drink alcohol, would they? ;-)</p>

<p>And then we have the top balcony that has a crane which is useful for all the barrels full of gems included. Also, a Jolly Roger waves proudly in the breeze.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to do this review because I felt kinda bad for underestimating this set so much. It is so cool, and I really enjoyed it more than I would&#39;ve imagined.</p>

<p>The only &quot;flaw&quot; I could see here are that there aren&#39;t as many rare pieces included asides the minifigures perhaps, but even those aren&#39;t that rare and appeared in many sets of the theme. So it should be fairly easy to rebrick this set and maybe that is why the prices at least on eBay in my country are still okay.</p>

<p>So all in all this set is great, and I would like for LEGO to release a set like this that would be more in the 60-70 dollar range again. Every good base nowadays seems to hover around 100 at minimum, which is unfortunate. This set has much potential, because of all the standard bricks, is playable and looks nice, what more do you want. :-)</p>
