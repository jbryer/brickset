Mojang&#39;s dedication to keeping the community of the game alive is impeccable, and their dedication to fun merch is even nicer. It&#39;s common that Minecraft products aren&#39;t accurate at all: introductions of fake mobs to toys, colours or sprite work being off, or in the case of LEGO, block sizes being beyond inconsistent, but what they lack in accuracy they make up for in quality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I purchased this set for one reason: I needed a nice transition set. My Minecraft sets have been gathering dust in their boxes, never to see the joy of a display in my room, so I decided to continue my ritual of changing my display on my dresser by taking apart the sets that were there and putting up every Minecraft set. That left one issue: no Nether portal meant no way of incorporating actual Nether sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is by far the nicest of the Nether-themed sets, with no overabundance of either Overworld or Nether builds. It also lines up wonderfully with other sets released this year: the warped forest on the nether end is perfectly-matched with the warped forest set, and the overworld matches up by complete coincidence with the bee farm: two baby sheep near each other, plenty of foliage for the bees, and a nice little pool to continue off of the previously-established pond and farm from that set, including a waterfall to imply Steve funnelled the water through.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures included with this set are a treat for fans of the new Nether update. Wither Skeletons are no longer fortress-exclusive mobs, shown by this single knight patrolling the field of netherrack, a common mob that&#39;s always nice to have, as well as a hoglin baby to bring a little bit more of that Nether Update flair to the set. As if new enemies aren&#39;t nice enough, we&#39;re also given a new armour print for Steve, featuring the newly-introduced Netherrite&nbsp;armour, a step above diamond ingame, as well as a sword. We&#39;re also given one dyed sheep, a more obscure mob from the game and one I can see a lot of play coming out of for kids. This set also includes two ore blocks: the newly-introduced Ancient Debris and the iconic gold ore. Also included are a red flower of some sort, a dual-printed furnace that you can turn around to simulate lighting it and removing fuel, and a pile of what appears to be fire charges or perhaps stockpiled fuel. Finally, the set includes a crimson fungus tree, which you can remove and place anywhere in your sets, much in-line with that Minecraft spirit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ruined portal itself is also a new structure ingame: sometimes partial Nether Portals will spawn in your world, complete with chunks of gold and obsidian to give you an idea of how and why to assemble such a portal. This set&#39;s play feature is to include an obsidian pillar where the lava and water meet, which can be removed and added to complete the otherwise broken portal. Lifting the lever on the back and pulling up a chunk in the middle then activates the portal itself, a very nice effect for something achieved with minimal parts.&nbsp; This does leave a gaping hole underneath though, which I have reservations with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing as how there&#39;s a purple sheep and red flower, this set is a huge missed opportunity to use the Lapis Lazuli ore and finally complete the repertoire of surface ores, but it&#39;s a minor gripe with an otherwise beautiful piece. If you&#39;ve been working on a LEGO&nbsp;Minecraft display or just want a tiny set with lots of detail and play features, this set is a great purchase to add to your world. It leaves just a little to be desired, and the building process is fun and engaging.</p>

<p>Firstly, I really enjoy the symmetry to the whole set, the water and lava at the front is neat and more of these water bricks is never a bad thing. Both sides have a bit of ore, gold and some ancient debris, so Steve would be able to mine up both of them to be able to craft some more of his netherite gear.&nbsp; Speaking of which, the netherite Steve in this set probably has my favourite looking of the Minecraft armour in the theme. One minor nitpick is I would like if they had included a netherite ingot, either the metal bar part or just the 2x1 tile that represents gold in other sets.</p>

<p>The baby animals in this set are pretty good, I saw some complaints online about the Baby Hoglin, while it is really basic&nbsp;I think it looks just as fine as the baby sheep included in this set.The main function of the set, the portal being able to be activated and fill with the iconic purple tint works pretty well, it uses a sort of trap door mechanism that is unlocked with a&nbsp;lever on the back, It isn&#39;t visible 99% of the time you look at it, however if they had disguised it as a block like the front I would have appreciated it more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While im pretty new to collecting LEGO&nbsp;Minecraft, I feel like even longer collectors of the theme would enjoy this sets high elevation of the portal, it makes it much more of a set piece of a display while still blending well into the other sets of the theme and sitting in between a overworld and nether area of a Minecraft collection&nbsp;</p>
