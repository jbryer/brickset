<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aesthetically, the Heavy-Duty Tow Truck is the standard for modern Technic:&nbsp;it looks great, with&nbsp;a lot of pieces dedicated to a clean and realistic final product. It&#39;s proportionately perfect, and the color scheme draws a lot of attention to the boom arm. The orange, Hulk-like mascot and&nbsp;lightning pattern stickers aren&#39;t for everyone, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;personally love the bombastic nature of these stickers, possibly due to how&nbsp;they wouldn&#39;t be out of place on a monster truck. Perhaps this tow truck contributes to the cleanup of demolition derbies!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the aesthetically attractive nature of this set would mean nothing if it couldn&#39;t perform- it is Technic after all. I am happy to report that&nbsp;this truck pushes the limit of how much playability a Technic set can have. It boasts ten splendid functions, from&nbsp;the&nbsp;lifting hood to the pneumatic boom.</p>

<p>Seeing how the functions around the bed are built first, I&#39;ll start with those. All of these functions are actuated with a turnable gear and clearly labelled with stickers above them. The yoke can be lifted to raise the front of a would-be nonfunctional vehicle off the ground; the first set of rear wheels can be raised as to provide for a tighter steering radius;&nbsp;the boom can be rotated 90 degrees to either side; and the outriggers&nbsp;can be extended. The outriggers are the most complex of these functions, and it took some finagling to ensure that both the two side and two rear outriggers would touch the ground simultaneously.</p>

<p>The cab section is built next, and it has an opening hood that reveals an engine with six pistons driven by the intermediaries on the two rearmost wheels. The engine is detailed with more parts than were necessary, but it&#39;s still appreciated. Front steering is driven by a gear on the top of the cab.&nbsp;This steering works surprisingly well given the size and weight of the tow truck.</p>

<p>Since this is the first pneumatic set in three years, arguably the&nbsp;most important things to get right are the pneumatic functions. These are controlled by three&nbsp;3-valve pneumatic actuators&nbsp;(labels to the sides of them) powered by a pump cylinder behind the cab. Each of the pneumatic functions work with a couple presses of the pump. The yoke is completed first (even before the cab) and extends&nbsp;downward to allow for a vehicle&#39;s wheels to be placed in front of it. It may be raised up when not in use through&nbsp;the same actuator with the lever flipped up. The boom arm comes last. Four pneumatic tubes are threaded through a turntable in order to connect with the large piston that changes the boom&#39;s elevation and the small piston that&nbsp;extends the arm. The boom can be raised to an impressive angle, but the&nbsp;arm doesn&#39;t extend as far as I&#39;d like it to have.&nbsp;A new, longer pneumatic piston would be needed in order to accomplish greater extension, so the limitation is understandable. Lastly are the two winches containing cord cleverly unlocked with a couple levers that would otherwise keep the cords in place to prevent unwanted extension when towing. The cords can be slung under two small wheels on the yoke&nbsp;to accomplish a more horizontal tow. These pneumatic functions combined with the boom&#39;s rotation make for a truly versatile piece of equipment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>42128: Heavy-Duty Tow Truck&nbsp;is a classic in the making that utterly blew me away.&nbsp;The fact that around 70% of the review is simply me describing the functions speaks volumes to the playability of the Heavy-Duty Tow Truck. My only real issue with the set is that the yoke can&#39;t really attach to other Technic vehicles without some modification. The lack of an alternate build is also a bit of a disappointment, but with how impeccable the tow truck is, it&#39;s excusable.</p>

"Dude45","2021-12-30T11:30:09.2Z","Great return to form for Technic","<p>I&#39;ve been annoyed lately by the number of uninteresting licensed set Technic has put out, where appearance clearly have taken priority over functions. That&#39;s why I was happy to see Technic release an old-school generic tow truck packed with features.</p>

<p>To me, this tow truck looks just like I would expect a traditional American truck, Peterbilt-style, to look. Being a trucking enthusiast, the styling with the colour scheme, stickers,&nbsp;and cool trucker accessories feels just right to me. The downside is that all the great and educational Technic features are hidden behind panels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of functions included is impressive given the very limited space these have been fit into. The ratio features/brick is second to none, which also gives great playability.</p>

<p>Unlike 42043 Mercedes Arocs, the previous truck with pneumatic functions,&nbsp;this set is very sturdy in all directions, which gives it a great and solid feel. Albeit not perfect, the instruction booklet is much clearer and easier to follow than its predecessor&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building process is nice, but with Technic you are often worried that you have made a mistake somewhere, as that often means you have to take apart the entire build and start over to correct a mistake. This is especially so for the pneumatic functions which can be a little extra difficult.</p>

<p>Having a second&nbsp;build for this set would have increased the value. Similarly, a build where the technic features aren&#39;t obscured would have been nice. Yet I&#39;m very happy to have purchased this set which I think will be considered one of the best Technic sets for years for come. I hope Technic continues on this path.</p>

<p>This set attracted me for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>nice colour scheme</li>
	<li>(what I would call) good-sized (=medium) truck</li>
	<li>good range of - only - <strong>manually</strong> controlled functions</li>
	<li>many play opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt=""Truck has same length as its box."" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42128/011_wr_35284.png"" style=""width: 640px; height: 504px;"" /></p>

<h3>Pneumatics</h3>

<p>The designers put pneumatic cylinders to operate the following functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>deploy of the tow-bar</li>
	<li>to raise the crane arm</li>
	<li>extension of the crane arm</li>
</ul>

<p>The first function may have an issue: The tube to the retraction side of the cylinder is routed through two pinholes. This puts some constraint on the angular movement of the cylinder. It may not extend or retract at every opportunity.<br />
<em>I have removed the blue 3L beam and got improved performance.</em></p>

<p>I did not try to raise the crane with any load on the winches. When lifting the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1"">42078</a> Mack off the ground the arm was retracting when the pressure was low.</p>

<p>In summary, I think that this sets makes good use of pneumatic (only) in those functions where no fine control of movement would be required.</p>

<h3>Other Tow Trucks</h3>

<p><img alt=""Manually operated tow trucks"" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42128/804_wr_34967.png"" style=""width: 800px; height: 303px;"" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8846-1/"">8846</a> is the first tow truck from technic <em>brick</em> era. Officially intended to tow the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8845-1/"">8845</a> Dune Buggy. (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9395-1/"">9395</a> would be similar.)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8462-1/"">8462</a> (Pneumatic) Tow Truck</li>
	<li>(<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8436-1/"">8436</a> Truck - featured the tow-bar but no crane)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8285-1/"">8285</a> Tow Truck</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42008-1/"">42008</a> Service Truck</li>
</ul>

<p>My rating on (most of) them is that pneumatic function for the tow-bar is too weak to lift trucks. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42128-1/"">42128</a> features two small linear actuators that I found sufficient for any task that I could come up with.</p>

<h3>Play Functions</h3>

<p>Purpose of a (any) tow truck is to salvage damaged vehicles. This one is intended to be used on heavy trucks.<br />
This is the list of trucks that I tried to tow away:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8462-1/"">8462</a> (First) pneumatic Tow Truck</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/8436-II/8436_2_41.jpg"">8436</a> -based tipper truck (different scale)</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1/"">42078</a> Mack Anthem Truck</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42112-1/"">42112</a> Concrete Mixer Truck</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42128/835_wr_35266.png"" style=""width: 480px; height: 360px;"" /></p>

<p>The tow-bar has a pivot point that supports left-right turning of truck + load combination. However, it can only attach at the very front of the towed vehicle. There is no support of the first / front axle. This will diminish play function: Truck may slide off the bar when towed on rough ground. They may easily fall off during turns.<br />
The height of the tow-bar does not allow picking up the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1/"">42078</a> Mack truck. Its front spoiler has very little ground clearance. You would have to use the crane to lift the Mack.</p>

<p><img alt=""Hauling the Mack will be cumbersome"" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42128/831_wr_35247.png"" style=""width: 480px; height: 360px;"" /></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I observed another flaw in the design: My truck suffers the same blocking of the fake engine as the first release of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42112-1/"">42112</a> Concrete Mixer Truck. This will occur only when the truck is pushed in forward direction. It can easily be fixed by lowering the 1/2 bushing on the brown axles.</p>

(<em>30.01.22</em>) However, a better fix would be to add 1/2 bushings to the lower end of the axles. It seems that this can be pushed up more easily:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have already complained about the poor tow options and the rear pneumatic cylinder.<br />
The reels of the two winches are simple. They do not cope well with the stiffness of the string + small weight of the hooks. The combination from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8285-1/"">8285</a> is way better suited for play.</p>

<p>Other than these the set has a good set of functions, offers adequate playability and foremost, is nice to look at.</p>

<p>You may ask what I am missing? The final touch to have the truck as the playset that is suggested. I believe those little bits that I wrote about can be fixed with little effort.<br />
I will give it a try...</p>

<p><a href=""https://brickset.com/article/60133"">Huw suggested</a> to modify the side panel that hold the large sticker. I went a little bit further and continued to blue stripe to the rear end:</p>

It was my first big LEGO TECHNIC set.&nbsp; When I saw it, I was surprised, and I started building this LEGO tow truck immediately. The build took me about 7 hours, but don&#39;t forget that it was my first TECHNIC set in more than 2000 parts. The build wasn&#39;t that difficult, but pneumatics were tough to be installed. As a result, I received good functional and detalised&nbsp;model of heavy - duty tow truck.</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>I must say that this set was built by me 3 times and practically every time when I built it, there were some difficulties with pneumatics, otherwise, it was quite fine to build.</p>
