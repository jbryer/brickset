I did see the Netflix show though and actually kinda liked it, so when Lego made sets (loosely) based off the show, it did pique my interest. Among the 4 sets made, I think the T. rex fossil easily took the cake for the best set.</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Cart and display stand:</b> 2 side builds accompany the fossil, the first of which is a wheel cart. The cart has a board that uses a nice sticker for the diagram of a T. rex skull, and additional accessories/details include a light shining down on the tan egg, a T. rex tooth, leaves, and a staff clipped on the side for a minifigure to point at the diagram.&nbsp;Now, for the display stand. It&rsquo;s a very simple build, but it gets the job done and beautifully displays the fossil. There&rsquo;s a cool sticker showing the length and scale of the T. rex and the fossil rests on 2 jumpers. Overall, the cart is a cute lil side build and the display stand looks good and serves its purpose well.</p>

<p><b>T. Rex Fossil:</b> With how unimpressive the piece count is, I&rsquo;m shocked with how good this model looks. The build experience wasn&rsquo;t really anything special and it went together extremely quickly, but the resulting model is outstanding! It&rsquo;s not completely perfect though, the color scheme could&rsquo;ve a bit more consistent, the hands/arms should&rsquo;ve been a bit bigger and rotatable, and the feet aren&rsquo;t exactly the best thing to look at, but considering it has a display stand to go on, I can kinda excuse it. I only have positives from here on out. I LOVE the appearance of the fossil, the build is very simple, but it works wonders as a display piece. I like how the rib cage was done, the tail has great articulation, and the decision to go with the molded T. rex head instead of a brick built design was brilliant, the head features great prints and sufficient rotation. And while this is a fantastic display piece, nothing is stopping you from going all Night at the Museum with this, the 2 points of socket joints on the legs provide a great range of articulation and really help bring the model to life. Overall, this build is simply awesome, it strikes the perfect balance between play and display, and its strengths definitely outweighs its weaknesses.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Owen Grady:</b> Hold up, what&rsquo;s Mario doing here? In case you don&rsquo;t know, Chris Pratt Dino wrangler doesn&rsquo;t show up in the Netflix series, which makes his appearance here out of place, inaccurate and somewhat frustrating. Clearly, Lego can&rsquo;t release a Jurassic World set without shoehorning Owen and/or Claire into it. Ok so, decent torso and leg print, and it&rsquo;s actually my first time getting the Chris Pratt face, so that&rsquo;s nice, I can use it for my Star-Lord instead. And&hellip; that&rsquo;s about it, it&rsquo;s a common Owen figure, moving on.</p>

<p><b>Darius:</b> Darius is a very prominent character in the show, so it&rsquo;s nice to get him in the cheapest set, though he&rsquo;s not my favorite in terms of the minifigures of the 6 campers. The legs are sand blue and they&rsquo;re the regular size which is really odd since he&rsquo;s an adolescent, mid-legs could not have been more appropriate here. The torso has a white shirt with a yellow hoodie and a tooth necklace, it&rsquo;s a great print and could easily be used for regular civilian figures. The face prints are new with a smile and scared expression which both look good and the &ldquo;Finn&rdquo; hair piece is used here, though I feel like the hair piece introduced with<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71031-11/T-Challa-Star-Lord"">&nbsp;T&#39;Challa Star-Lord&nbsp;</a>would&rsquo;ve been a better fit. Overall, I like the prints here, however, there are some pieces I consider to not be a right fit for the character, but otherwise this is a decent figure.</p>

<p><b>Baby Triceratops: </b>I&rsquo;d say the inclusion of a baby triceratops wasn&rsquo;t entirely necessary, but it&rsquo;s an excellent inclusion nonetheless. This design is triple-molded, with sand blue and tan for the main body and white for the horns. There&rsquo;s also some good printing to be found on the body and face. This piece&nbsp;also uses the same system used on Lego horses, with a 1x2 brick and 1x2 tile fitting in the middle gap, so you could have minifigures riding it if you want. Overall, I don&rsquo;t have much to say about it other than it&rsquo;s cute and definitely a good addition to the set.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The price of R600&hellip; isn&rsquo;t the worst thing, but still not the best. I can see where it&rsquo;s coming from though. The fossil is pretty sizable and the molded T. rex head and baby triceratops also boosts the price. I think it&rsquo;s an ok price overall, but as usual, it could be improved.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is definitely one of the best sets to come out of the Jurassic World theme, I think this set has great appeal and can attract non JW fans. The fossil will look excellent on display with any collection. It has its little issues, but I can overlook them. The figures weren&rsquo;t done exactly the best though, Darius could&rsquo;ve been better and the inclusion of Mario is just strange, replace him with literally ANY another camper and it&rsquo;d be fine. But oh well, either way, this set is so fun and it&rsquo;s easily recommendable, whether you&rsquo;re a JP fan, someone who likes prehistoric animals/history or even a casual Lego fan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Owen Grady appears in several sets, so his appearance here isn&#39;t special. I still don&#39;t like the alternate face; it just looks like he&#39;s squinting, not getting ready for action.</p>

<p>Darius Bowman appears alongside Owen, even though Grady wasn&#39;t even in Camp Cretaceous. This is the cheapest set to get Darius in, and I definitely like the torso printing. His alternate faces are suitable.</p>

<p>A baby Triceratops is also included, in order to wreak havoc on the exhibit. The printing is new, and the slot for a saddle is pretty cool. I hope we get a System version of the Gentle Giants Petting Zoo at some point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Builds:</strong></p>

<p>A small cart is included with the set. A whiteboard and egg incubator are included on top of it. There are also some accessories clipped onto the cart, including a pointer, an egg, a dinosaur tooth, and a leaf. This range of accessories is fine and seems suitable for a museum setting.</p>

<p>The T-Rex skeleton isn&#39;t great. It&#39;s such a random mish-mash of colours that don&#39;t look anywhere near realistic. If LEGO had decided to recolour some of the white pieces in tan, it might&#39;ve looked better. But the nougat on the feet? What the heck? They need to recolour that piece. The model has lots of joints for posing the dinosaur, although the ones on the tail are kind of loose and aren&#39;t very useful. Probably the only thing that redeems this build is the new printed T-Rex head with the skull. I love it and hope they can reprint&nbsp;other dinosaur heads to get the same effect.</p>

<p>The T-Rex comes with a stand to display it on. The feet attach only by two single-stud connections, but are nevertheless very sturdy. The plaque is a sticker, but I personally don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>This set was such a huge letdown. It reflects the wave it came in: rushed due to Dominion&#39;s postponement, and therefore rather lame. The only reason anyone would get this set is for Darius, the Triceratops, and the T-Rex skull. Other than that, this set isn&#39;t that great.</p>
