"A_Brickset_user","2001-04-29T00:00:00Z","","This is one of the best sets Lego has ever made. True pirate fans will debate over whether the 6285 or 6286 is superior but my vote goes with this one because it was the first big ship. It has great details and is huge. The sails do not have any pirate markings on them so you could easily turn this into a merchant vessel if you wanted to. There is not much that could be improved on this one, maybe more cannons but thats about it. It has been one of my favorite sets for a long time, I wish I had 3 or 4 of them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is THE complete pirate ship, comes with storage areas, working cannons, sails, masts, storage areas, a rowing boat, an anchor, a hook for hoisting treasure containers, storage areas and a captain's cabin with a map, treasure chest and drinking vessel.  There are eight minifigs, including a pirate captain and a female pirate, also a parrot and monkey.

  Where I once believed I could determine the type of model the Black Seas Barracuda was by pictures, actually acquiring the model and assembling it has proven to be an eye-opening experience. This is a superior schooner model with great use of space and nice attention to detail.
The Barracuda is a schooner style vessel with simple color combinations of yellow, white and red. Identical spacious hold areas located in the front and rear of the ship are accessed from above by deck hatches or on the lower level by way of shuttered windows. Though these are very roomy for barrels and treasure chests, you shouldn't shove anything too far back or you'll have to dismantle the ship to get your cargo back. Grey plates neatly cover these cargo areas and serve as decks for the second level, even passing over the port hatches through which two cannons on each side shoot. A large cabin at the rear of the ship is entered through double wooden doors on each side of a staircase that leads to the upper (hinged) bridge/deck. Access for playing in the cabin can be achieved by lifting the upper deck or lowering the hinged rear wall of the cabin.
Perhaps the best thing about this ship is that it can easily be turned into a non-pirate/merchant ship. Where later Pirate ships have the skull and crossbones boldly printed on the main sails, the jolly roger insignia are used moderately on four pirate flags here. Take down the flags and you have a ship with absolutely no pretensions other than being a simple carrier craft.
Unique pieces are firing hatches in red and two strange yellow six-petal flower-like elements that adorn the rear. The crew is made up of eight pirates and a captain (I used the female figurehead as a crew member to add some gender variation to my mostly male crew). Also, an abundance of swords, muskets and pistols make the set that much more appealing.
This set is very satisfying, and considering the beautiful model it makes, the instructions alone are worth looking for.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-04T19:48:38Z","nothing like the orignal Pirate Ship","well i guess most people have already said how great this 6285 BSB. I personally think this is better than the 6286 because of the overall design and detail. First off i think this was more realistic because of how the sails are not all splashed with skull and cross bones. The red, yellow, white and black makes the colour sceme work wonderfully. The only thing that i could see to make the bsb work that little is adding two more cannons and slots in the hull. There are many different pieces which will be great in making customs out of. This pirate ship looks even better when there are atlest 14 pirate men on the ship. It is in scale to the other pirate sets such as 6274 and 6276 etc.... its a good move that lego rereleased it. A little bit smaller that the 6286 but its a whole lot better in design. You have ofcourse the captains quaters and the stock rooms. The tourches on the end of the ship makes it even more realistic. You get tones of flap shut windows and the sails...well i can't really thing of anything to say about the sails. also included are 4 cannons and tons of cannon balls. A pully system for the treasure. A triditional head figure on the front of the ship (female ofcourse) the only thing i could see to make it looks better is one more pair of cannons.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-23T07:44:23Z","Truly stunning","   There is only one problem with this model:  the huge ugly custom pieces.  I see why they used them though, as other hull construction methods woud probably have been more expensive and building convincing masts is difficult as well.  Apart from this, I can find nothing wrong.  There are plenty of minifigs for great play capabilities and before I got this set, I hardly realised so many minifig accessories could be included in just one set.  I'm not sure, as I got this set mixed in with other Lego, but I think that every minifig can have both hands full and there will still be accessories to spare.
   I have found this set invaluable for pieces when building other models.  An abundance of slopes, plates and arches are in this set, you cannot overate the usefulness of those parts for MOC building (well, maybe you can, but they're very useful all the same).
   This model is one of the few I know that is truly satifying as a standalone set.  It made a very good decoration in our living room for the short time that I kept it together people that urge to build came around again.  This is the only system model I have that takes a long time to build.  All the rest are small to medium sized, so it is a nice change to have a set that will take 3 hours to build at a good pace, or longer if it is mixed into the rest of your Lego (like mine).

Parts: the origional version of this ship included 4 draw-spring firing deck guns, these are wonderful, also impressive are the hull componets introduced by the baracuda and her carrebean clipper sister ship, they allow infinite expansion for the creative builer.

Art:  the visual beauty of this set is stand alone in the pirate series, the rails, decks, cabins and detail are a cut above any set in the pirate series, it is an elegant and sleek design the creators should be proud of.

One piece in this set that I think is really rare is the ancore piece. It comes with four cannons, which is cool concidering the fact that you don't get that many in one set that often. The set also came with a parrot for the captain. (I guess the captain couldn't decide wether to have either a parrot or a monkey as a pet.) What I thouht was a good Idea is for them to put a lego torso in the front where the ship comes to a point as a statue. The mast pieces are also cool. The set includes:

-a parrot
-a monkey
-a row boat

The ship as a whole is nicely designed: lacking the skulls and crossbones blazoned across the sails of the later models, and with only the four Jolly Rogers flags, it is also nicely understated.  The colour scheme on the hull and sails combine well together, and the 'working' cannons are great fun to play with.

Cons: There's only like 3 so I thought I would start out with this.
The monkey doesn't have a banana. Then again, bananas hadn't been created in 1989 so who cares?
Also, the crane needs a winch and the crew's quarters don't have any features.

Pros: Long list here
THE BEST SET I OWN!
Lots of minifigs
Lots of weapons and accesories
4 cannons
extremely well built
Monkey+parrot
rare elements like admiral's hat and tricorners from the first and second officers
also a blue bandana
2 treasure chests
sails don't have any ugly skulls on them but are cool
amazing color scheme
dude in front like an idol for the bow of the ship
plank
handrail things are cool
captain's ship steering wheel
even a rudder!
two big and small pirate flags skull + x-bones
masts and rigging
crane
rowboat w/ oars
2 treasure maps
anchor
captain's study

ok...I could go on forever but must stop...now, on to the review

I acquired this set several years ago from eBay. It is extremely fun to build and takes a long time because it is so massive and ownage. I really don't know where to start, so how about the minifigs? Ok, first is the Captain. He has a cool pegleg and awesome hat. His eyepatch and epaulettes are pretty neat, too. He can hold the parrot which is just as awesome and multicolored. Mostly he is steering or in his cabin. Then the First Mate. Whenever I make a new setup with my ship, he is up at the stern helping the Captain with his course or else steering at the helm itself. With his cool torso and black tricorner, he looks almost formal like an Imperial. Now the Second Mate. He is usually giving out orders or fighting, should the ship come under attack. He has a brown tricorner hat and looks more or less exactly like the First. Now, the 2 red crew members have bandanas and cool faces. I usually have one in the rowboat, and if the ship is under a siege one is fighting. Otherwise, they are raising/lowering the sails, loading the cannons, or walking the plank. The blue crew members are the same as the red guys, just with different colored bandanas and duties. Those dudes usually weigh anchor, operate the crane, or take care of the treasure chest. Occasionally I will also have them patrol the deck with muskets. Lastly, the woman. I have no clue why she was included in the set, but is sometimes useful. Basically she just stands around in my displays, or shoots people with her pistol. Mostly, though, she is like coming out of the doors or something stupid. Overall, great minifigs and insane designs. The possibilities with this set are almost endless. It was actually my first Lego Pirates set, and I still love it. With awards like one of the most highly respected Legends, a re-release, and just extreme pwnage, this is a definite must-have for all Pirates fans. Get it.

P.S. Unless you really want to, do NOT get the new Brickbeards Bounty if you have a choice between that or the Black Seas Barracuda.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BasiltheBatlord","2009-02-15T20:45:27.543Z","The greatest pirate ship","The Baraccuda has long been credited as the best ship in Redbeard's armada. I would have to agree. It is similar to the Carrabean Clipper in many ways, and in the commercial, they are shown battling each other. The baracudda is probably a former merchant vessal. It has lots of features like a detailed captain's study, weapon racks, cannons, an anchor, a ship's wheel, a crane, a hold, a crew's quarters, 2 crow's nests, a row boat, neat sails, redbeard's animals, a good size crew, and a figuirehead, to name most of them.

And like many, I recieved this set as a gift at Christmas time that year. It was my Red Ryder BB Gun. There had been no others sets like this to compare before the introduction of Pirates. So much so, it was brought back in later years for Lego's Legend series of released sets. And yes, Lego has done several other big Sailing Ships like thisi since... while they might be better, they can't compare to a Classic and this is it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Featuring a crew of 8 Pirates, one of whom is the legendary Captain Redbeard hiimself and Lego's first named minifigure. The pirates sail the seven seas in search of plunder and adventure. A ninth crew member is present if you count the monkey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the details for this ship are just phenominal. Two masts with rigging and red sails go out of the way for giving a realistic look to this set. The Captain's Quarters can be gotten to by lifting up the roof where the Steering Castle is at. The detail inside with Chest of gold and map was fairly good for the day. Holdings for the brigs, four cannons, anchor and rowboat that is dragged along behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years I have kept this set intact and set on a shelf for display as when I'd first gotten the set, it was the first time ever as a child that I'd needed help from an adult in putting such a&nbsp; large and complex set together. If you're lucky enough to have or to get ahold of one of these sets, either the original or the re-release in Legends, you have a piece of true Lego History and Classics in your collection.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"daftpirate","2010-09-27T18:42:22.92Z","One of the Best!","The BSB is one of the best LEGO sets ever made. First of all, it has great parts, and lots of minifigs. It should come with one or two imperials, though. If you just have pirates, it gets boring fast. Also, the BSB has cool specialty pieces, like the hull, masts, sails, rope, and other cool rare pieces. The playability is very good. Some problems are that the cannons are bad, because they don't stay in one place, and this makes the red flaps look awkward. Also, the captains cabin is plain and hard to reach, because of the plate in the way. Also, the rowboat does not fit on the back like it's supposed to. Other than that, this set is awesome.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- 8 minifigs + monkey and parrot<br>- 4 cannons<br>- specialty pieces<br>- great design<br>- playability<br>- good price<br>- awesome<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- design flaws<br><br>Overall, this set is 5/5.<br><br>PS: the box is very cool, having lots of alternate models and interesting pictures of the ship, plus the 'Pirates of the Black Seas Barracuda' story thing on the front flap.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

 you are presented with what is seen by many as the greatest Pirate ship
 available, here we see the wench appear for the second time (the 
Captain for the fourth time) whilst we also see six other crew members, 
eight in a crew is a great number (only beaten by nine later on). The 
ship is immense, it is the only pirate ship not to feature an obvious 
pirate skull and crossbones’ on the sails,&nbsp; we have naked (apparently) 
figurehead at the front, a monkey, an anchor, a ships wheel (one ship 
later failed to have one), a captain’s cabin and enough cannons to blow 
most opponents away. The&nbsp;whole set features no flaws, it is seen as the 
benchmark ship with which others will be judged against.&nbsp;It was so good 
it was even rereleased in 2002 as a Legends set. &nbsp;Overall my most 
favourite of sets.<br><br></span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"PeteM","2014-05-01T00:29:57.607Z","The mother of all pirate ships","<p>The Black Seas Barracuda was the &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; release of the brand new pirates theme in 1989 and arguably set the template for all of the many ships, both big and small, that have followed since.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box, in common with all big sets back then, had a large cardboard flap which opens up to show the contents stored in a plastic tray behind plastic windows, with minifigures and some of the more interesting pieces (flags! sails! guns!) displayed prominently. There was also some story about the pirates and sets featured in the first wave of releases, though as sadly my box succumbed to damp, mould and finally the bin many years ago, I can&rsquo;t comment on the narrative value. It probably involved treasure and some fighting.</p>

<p>Anyone used to instructions in the more modern sets will be amazed to see that all 870-odd pieces of the set are constructed in just 28 steps contained within a single instruction booklet. As with all instructions back then there are no piece &lsquo;call outs&rsquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s a never-ending game of spot-the-difference to progress through the book. It may just be my copy, but the black pieces look more dark grey though, as there isn&rsquo;t any significant dark grey used in the set, that&rsquo;s not such a problem.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In launching a new theme, Lego brought us a number of new and interesting pieces &ndash; most noticeably the ship-specific inclusions, such as the giant hull sections, cloth sails in three different sizes, masts, rigging, and a ships wheel. There were also number of new accessories, including cutlasses and muskets, firing cannons, and a parrot and monkey to liven up the on-board atmosphere. There are even a couple of printed pieces thrown into the mix too, most noticeably the two large and two small pirate flags, as well as a couple of treasure maps.</p>

<p>A lot of the set is made up of fairly standard bricks and plates, albeit in fairly large numbers, with a few more interesting bricks thrown in for good measure such as the elongated inverted slopes which make up the stern as well as the decorative shaped pieces over the windows.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I may be wrong, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve read somewhere that this was the first theme where the minifigures sport unique faces, unlike the default &lsquo;yellow smiley&rsquo; that was the mainstay until then. The 8-strong crew certainly have a bit of character about them, with the wonderfully detailed captain standing out, complete with peg leg and bicorn printed with the traditional skull and crossbones (presumably in case there was an doubt as to his profession). The rest of his motley crew look suitably piratical, complete with stubble and suitably gruff faces, and the inclusion of a female pirate was a welcome move towards a bit more gender balance in sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build process is fairly straightforward, building upon the hull sections to create the decks and under-deck areas. There are some interesting techniques (for the time) to create a more asymmetrical shape for the stern, with the poop desk sloping upwards and the rear of the captain&rsquo;s cabin moving out to overhang the stern, both of which utilise different hinges. There is also a rare early instance of upside-down building in the ships spars - simple enough nowadays, but mindblowing for my 8 year old brain!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The ship looks fantastic when complete &ndash; the mostly black elements used to create the superstructure above the initial hull contrast brilliantly with the bright yellow used as &lsquo;gold trim&rsquo; around window and lining the bow etc. The inclusion of some rudimentary rigging really finishes the model off, with a line running from bow to stern via the top of the masts, as well as a crane located amidships with suspended treasure chest. OK, the crane can only really swing the treasure around above everyone&rsquo;s heads, but that&rsquo;s all you need when it&rsquo;s primary function is actually to fling members of the crew around the ship during a pitched battle. Similarly, while access to the captain&rsquo;s cabin via both the hinged stern and the poop deck is nice enough, most of my play focused on battles across the decks, firing the cannons and chases through the rigging, rather than whatever might be going on &lsquo;below decks&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The first and (arguably) still the best, the Black Seas Barracuda remains impressive 25 years on from it&rsquo;s debut &ndash; there&rsquo;s a reason it was chosen to be re-released as a &lsquo;Legend&rsquo; in 2001. The sheer size and detail was amazing at the time and the ship easily holds it&rsquo;s own next to those that have come after it. Both aesthetically and playably (probably not a word?) it has all you could ask for in a set and easily earns pride of place in my collection.</p>

"naf","2013-06-11T12:38:52.073Z","One of the best sets to come out of LEGO.","<p>Throughout the 80's, I received one giant LEGO set a year at Christmas, and this was my gift in 1989. &nbsp;I have to go with a cliche here: ""they just don't make 'em like this anymore."" &nbsp;This ship is absolutely beautify. &nbsp;All of the attention went to the details of the ship, rather than having ""play features"" like collapsing masts or the back blowing apart. &nbsp;The design is very realistic, while still keeping that classic LEGO charm. &nbsp;The color scheme is fantastic, the yellow and black contrast nicely with the red and white sails. &nbsp;The captain has spacious quarters in the sterncastle. &nbsp;The top lifts up, and the back of the shop opens up so it's very easy to access and see into the captain's quarters. &nbsp;This is one of the few ships in the pirate theme that has an actual deck that goes around the entire ship, with the cannons below deck. &nbsp;The ship comes equipped with 4 cannons which are more than enough to take on the lesser armed Caribbean Clipper (the Imperial counterpart to this ship). &nbsp;All in all, a great, well designed, classic LEGO set. &nbsp;Any child would be thrilled to play with this thing, and any adult should feel proud to display this beauty on a shelf.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Beautiful design and color scheme.</li><li>No silly play features here, 100% of the effort went into the design of the ship.</li><li>Large crew of minifigures, including Captain Redbeard and a female pirate.</li><li>Satisfying build build experience.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>If I had to come up with something, I always wished it had 3 cannons per side.</li></ul>
<p>If you see this set for a decent price, don't hesitate to buy it! &nbsp;This is a classic set that any child or adult would love to build and display.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
