The screws are very difficult to get in straight and the flat ends need to be firmly pressed on a non-slippery surface to stop them from spinning. It took me over an hour to take apart the 6 cases, clean them, move the coins, and put them back together. The inside still has plenty of dust trapped in it. If you want to display all 5 coins together in one case it does look nice but the time, cost, and effort involved could be much better spent building actual Lego sets!</p>
