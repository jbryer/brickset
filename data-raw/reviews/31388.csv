<p>The build is quite unusual for a small house, using a nice sideways (SNOT) technique to build up the orange outer walls and windows which are then connected to the outside of the inner, white walls. This enables some interior decoration together with the carrot shaping of the outside. None of the techniques were too tricky for young builders and it all comes together quite solidly.</p>

<p>There is some nice parts use, a nice hidden element in the attic and fun details fitting out the overall appearance, such as the chest of drawers, the flowers in the garden and the various foliage elements. Nothing too fancy, but adds some nice touches to the overall appearance. For the adult fan, nothing too special but lots of orange and white which are the current colours for space themed sets.</p>

<p>Plenty of stickers, but I don&#39;t think much is lost by excluding them. As normal for me, I left them off and the model still looks just as good and plays just as well. The closest to an essential sticker is the one for the mirror inside.</p>

<p>The little bunny figure is quite cute, and being made of fairly common parts it was quite easy to build a second one so it has a playmate. Doing so considerably increased the play value for my daughter.</p>

<p>My daughter has had a lot of fun playing with this one, and the extra bunny I made really added to the fun.</p>

<p>As a GWP, it was worth spending to get it. Easter GWPs from previous years have turned up for purchase later (e.g. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40371-1/Easter-Egg"">40371 Easter Egg</a>) and if this does come up for sale, I would recommend it as a purchase.</p>
