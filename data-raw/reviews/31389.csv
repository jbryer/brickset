They canceled the promo owners wallet and pictures due to &quot;shipping issues on the US west coast &quot;. So why not just ship it later? The build is good, but there is a glaring( to anyone who knows Porsches) error on the dash. 911s have a large central tachometer, always have but this has two gauges side by side. They got it right on the GT3RS, and 911RSR. I built mine as a Targa Turbo, but have to order some pieces. $1.24 worth. Would it have been too much to ask to just include them in the set? Yes, those really existed, just extremely rare.&nbsp;It&#39;s bigger than the other creator expert cars I have, Mini, F40 and DB5 so I&#39;m not sure how to display it.&nbsp;</p>

In other parts of Europe the price is around &euro;130, which feels fairer. I also missed out on the owner&#39;s pack, which was already sold out.</p>

<p>I have nothing else to say about this set negatively. The build is AMAZING. The appeal is excellent, and the possibilities of customization are great. I only wonder why they did not include a 3rd model of the most classic 911: the base Carrera, there are just not enough parts to make a fully smooth version, and there also is no print which says &quot;Carrera&quot;. I think with that, this set would be a 10/10. I prefer the Targa the most, as I am a huge Porsche Targa enthusiast.&nbsp;</p>
