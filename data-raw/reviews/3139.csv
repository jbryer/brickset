"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-24T00:04:24Z","Wow","Ive looked around and around but this is the ship I keep coming back to for it looks more refined if you will. The cannon design of the stock model is ingenious but in riskier battles it would have you sunk that's why any one with the simple know how could easily increase the armourment by an added 4 cannons. If anyone knows where I can buy one in oh say a good price range let me know. If any of you know of someone who is selling one in Canada please do tell me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

From  the  time  I've  spent  with  his  model,  I've  noticed  the  model  is  almost  accurate  to  the  real  thing.  I  say  '9'  becuase  the  ship  before  this  one,  (Black  Seas  Barracuda),  IS  the  most  accurately  built  pirate  ship.  Black  Seas  Barracuda  has  entries  to  below  deck  on  both  ends.  In  back,  kitchen,  supplies  and  goods  and  up  front,  sleeping  headquarters.

 This Looks amazing and is a very good ship (lego needed LARGE ships to keep a big kid like me happy) but apart from that, it was a dissapointing design with 8 gun ports and only four cannons

 its awkward to fire the cannons from these things anyway so why not arm it to the teeth.  at least then it looks sooo much cooler!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-01T18:16:18Z","the deck guns . . . oh my gosh the deck guns!","this set is the best set by far.  the cannon set up is considerably realistic because pirates lived off of what they stole so haveing four guns that they would move from one side or another depending on shich side the battle was fought is realistic.  plus in ship to ship comabt there would only be one ship on one side so if you wouldnt need cannons on the other.  but the coolest hting (arguably) is the deck guns.  little mini cannons situated on the bridge that were used to fire on the other ships crew severly reducing their manpower.  deck guns were used alot in real life and this is the only ship ive seenin the lego series that acuratly depicts that.  the only complaint that i have is the green cannon covers . . . green?  nothing else on the ship is green!  but i just replaced those with covers more to my liking (the littel skull flags now act as my cannon covers).  10 out of 10 for sure.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-10T16:26:34Z","Good","Great ship but not nearly as good as the Barracuda. The rotating cannons look childish and not realistic, the rudder turning system doesn't leave any room for captain's quarters. And the flaps on the forecastle look just silly. But the stern section is much. much better than the one of the Barracuda. I've remodeled my ship so that these flaws were removed but had to leave these rotating cannons due to the lack of extra ones, and I've also changed colours - mine is red+white+black+gray, unfortunately don't have a photo of it yet.

One of the reasons I like this one better is becouse the small hull size makes it look so fast and elegant. I think the best part is that it has 4 cannons on one side, even though you can't put another 4 cannons on the opposing side as the hull is not wide enough.

"OWF","2012-11-18T21:46:31.303Z","Most Wanted","<h4>Introduction</h4><p>Skull's Eye Schooner (in US) or The Black Skull (in EU), is the largest ship in the Classic Pirates Series and it was released in 1993.<br>This Ship was not promoted as it was Black Seas Barracuda (The Dark Shark), but even without such promotion, this ship earned its reputation among the best Lego sets of all time.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has lots of unique parts that can be found only in this set.<br>The blue tree palm top can be found only here and the Imperial Flagship 6271.<br>The panel with Jolly Roger Pattern can be found only in this set and also the Hull with the Red Top is present only here.<br>All these are ordinary bricks that can only be found here, but here are many other parts that are completely dedicated.<br><br>The Sails are completely unique and they were made like they couldn't be better.<br>The combination between black and white makes the vessel to look far more agressive comparing to a different one that has red or blue combined with white.<br>The Jolly Roger on the top sail may look a bit too childish, but comparing to Brickbeard's Bounty, at least this one is more serious and can pass the critics.<br><br>There is a total of 4 cannons which is a lot to play with or to expose against any potential enemy.<br>They are connected through a system which lets the player to rotate them 360 degrees and place them on both sides of the deck.<br><br>Another beautiful part is that this is the only Ship ever made that has a safe boat.<br>The back of the main Ship has a system to attach the safe boat which let the player to release it only in a case of emergency.<br><br>Skull's Eye Schooner is the first and one of the few Ships that have a mast above the Pirate cabin.<br>The Pirate cabin has 2 white doors (also used on western sets), and the player would have access to the cabin by opening the side walls by releasing the system which stops the walls to open unwanted.<br><br>If you look at it, the first triangular sail can be considered the head of the shark and the last triangular sail can pass as being the tail of the shark, so I'd say that this ship indeed has a very nice shape.<br><br>There are also 3 different animals, a little of everything, a parrot, a monkey and a shark.<br><br>Another important thing to mention is that Lego 6286 is one of the two sets who have the system to controll the helm by rotating the steering, the other one being 6271.<br><br>No matter how much I talk about Skull's Eye Schooner parts, I feel like I'll never finish, so I'll stop here and I'll let anything else to be discovered by you when you'll build it.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>These minifigs are a ""classic"", and a classic will always remain memorable and awesome due to their mark over the decades.</p><p><span>[img]http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh23/stuffyk/CaptainRoger.png[/img]</span><br><br><b>Captain Roger</b> (Redbeard) is considered the best pirate captain of all time, even after Pirates 2009 were released, and this set will prove why he is in the top of the pirate captains list.<br>He has a bit of everything, and he is full of charm without trying to catch your attention with shiny epaulettes or shiny hook.<br>His hat has the basic skull on it which makes it more natural comparing with the cartoonish skull present in later Pirate sets.<br><br><b>Pirate Merchant</b> is the most rare pirate of all time.<br>He is present only in two large sets, (6286 Skull's Eye Schooner &amp; 6277 Imperial Trading Post).<br>His brown vest makes him elegant and unique.<br><br><b>Pirate Female</b> is also a very nice adition to your Pirates Collection.<br>She is very well detailed on her torso by having painted a classic corset and a belt.<br>Her red corset among her blue bandana makes a very nice combination on the deck.<br>Her head is detailed with very large lips which makes her impossible to get confused with any other minifigure.<br><br>All other Pirates in the crew are very nice due to their simplicity, and you will be wondered how you'll never get bored of them even if they are are extremely basic.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building Skull's Eye Schooner is a compete challenge for everyone of all ages, no matter if you're a boy or a girl, a man or a woman.<br>You will never get bored to place another and another brick and with the every step you go further, you will become more and more addicted to finish.<br>The combination of colors will be combined in harmony and when you'll say ""it's done"", you will be looking at something what some Pirate collectors consider ""The Best Pirate Ship"".</p><p><span>[img]http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh23/stuffyk/SES.png[/img]</span><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The complete model looks absolutely amazing.<br>It has 66cm (26inches) long, 23cm (9inches) width and 49cm (19inches) tall.<br>At first point, you will probably consider this the best pirate ship of all time, but later, once you look at it over and over again, you will be surprised how the best can become even better.<br>It becomes more beatufiul each day, day after day, and you will be surprised how you never get bored of looking at it.<br><br>If you'll try to add something to the completed model, you notice that it is indeed completed and there is nothing else to add there.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As a summary, I recommend to buy it, no matter when or from where.<br>If you mind to have the shooting cannons, then you should aim for a European version and to recognize the EU version you should look for the box that doesn't have the Pirate Flag at the Top-Right corner of the front picture.<br>If you don't mind to have the shooting cannons, then you can aim for the US version, and this one will bring to you a short Pirate Story on the Lid of the opened box.<br>As this set has been released in 1993 and today it is extremely hard to find it new and unopened, you will probably have to buy it second-hand from eBay.<br>Its price is preety expensive comparing to all other Pirate Ship, but you will consider it worth.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SimonStickfish","2009-09-11T08:54:36.25Z","Good ship","I just received a Skull's Eye Schooner this morning, and I just completed building it. My ship isn't entirely complete, it misses the four great sails, two cannons, the monkey, a big pirate's flag and some very small pieces. But it's about 97% complete I think and it was about one third of the regular price on Ebay.

She's gorgeous. She's slightly longer and taller than the #6285 Black Seas Barracuda, and exactly the same width. Her crew is one man larger, thanks to the mysterious brown vested sailor that looks like a renegade blue French officer. Her third mast with small sail makes her faster than her older sistership BSB. But the BSB has more loading space.

The steering mechanism of the SES is nice, and it takes up far less space than I had expected. But if it were real, her turning circle would be to big. But that's okay. THe SES has a nice crane mechanism, better than the one of the BSB I think.

Her color scheme is good, but I prefer the gold black of the BSB. The few blue elements of the ship seem to make a strange contrast with the rest of her, and I don't really like the statue on the bough, it too dark. But the SES is better armed. Although hated by some here, I really think the turning system for the four cannons is good thinking. The hanging life boat is smart thinking as well.

Pro's:
-tall
-long
-faster (more sails)
-crane
-able to carry more cannons (8)
-better armament/more weapons
-large crew (9), shark, monkey and parrot
-working steering mechanism
-life boat on the back

Cons:
-color scheme
-bough statue
-smaller cabin
-smaller storage space
-skull on main sail (based on pictures)

"CCOOK","2008-12-16T23:19:38.873Z","EXCELLENT!","This is definitely one of the absolute best sets ever - I just got it the other day (bought off of eBay) and it is worth its weight in gold.  I'm not sure if it's better than the Barracuda - I think they may be tied as far this goes, but this ship has some nice features that make it different from the Barracuda.

I like the third mast in the back - it really complements the ship nicely, and I really like the larger main sheet with the skull and crossbones - this the the same size as the main sheet that comes with the Imperial Flagship and Armada Flagship.  The ship has four cannons on turntables that cannot fall out of the ship like the cannons on every other LEGO pirate ship.  The cabin is not as good as the Barracuda because the ship's wheel has a long plate attached to it that turns the rudder and takes up some cabin space.  I only made a couple of modifications to this ship after building it - I added a short brown ladder up to the forward deck and filled in the lower deck with some more grey plates, and also swapped the bland figurehead below the bowsprit with a skeleton.

I would recommend this ship to anyone - it's easily worth $300 USD!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2009-11-02T17:16:37.293Z","Impossible not to compare with the bsb","Now I own the bsb and the ses i finally feel able to post a review. 

This set was recently dragged from under my bed at my parents house which due the unfortunate position of a window and careless nature of cats came out alittle worse for wear.

It has now been rebuilt (and all the white parts replaced) and takes pride of place within all my lego sets. Firstly is massive, really big, contains nine minifigs and loads of pirate themed weapons.

The trimming on the ship is excellent and really makes it stand out, I like the black and white sails and even quite like the skull and crossbones design on the larger sail at the back. 

The colours flow nicely from the brown hull of the ship, red to grey to black and finally white. Theres plenty of storage at the front although it seems with pirate ships never enough detail goes into the front section (cover it with a lid and don't ask questions). 

The captains cabin is nice although interupted by a clumsy steering mechanism, and gives good access with two hinged walls and a removable roof. 

Four cannons available on one side make it the meanest ship out there (until 10210 anyway), i would like more detail and completion of the floor of this ship, something like the bsb has would have made this set almost perfect.

If we are going to compare it with the bsb, it is better (IMHO) in the following regards.

Working winch,  extra mast at the back,  cool storage for the little boat,  working (albeit badly) rudder and the extra minifig. 

The bsb is the more asthetically pleasing boat and I think overall the better but this is about the ses. Its an easy five star set for me, the few cons i've found can't out way the hundres of positive things about this set.

Pros
-Massive ship, loads of pirate weapons and minifigs
-Very striking model when built 
-Four working cannons and enougth ammo to take out 6276 and 6274
-Brilliant storage for the little boat
-The view from the back is stunning with arches and mix of colours 


Cons
-White doors (into cabin) look wrong on a pirate set
-No detail on floor of boat (its just cannons down there)
-I know its picky but why green flags?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
It has lots of minifigs and cannons and the hsip is very big

Cons:
Can you say that? Because i cant its just PERFECT!

"SirSven7","2012-01-09T21:12:17Z","Lego Steve's Review","<span style=""font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"">Now we see&nbsp;another 
reason why these years are looked back with such fondness, this ship has
 been argued by many as the better of the two pirate ships, It contains 
all that the previous ship contained, but also came with a nicer colour 
scheme (the red and white works really well) there is also the inclusion
 of an extra sail at the back and the pirate figure head at the front 
looks better (in my opinion). It has to noted that the set also 
contained a greater variety of minifigs (including the Wench and 
Brownshirt Steve). In honesty both the sets are of a very high-class, 
and it is nice to have the luxury of choice over a favourite rather than
 there being only one good set, more of this say’s I arrrg.<br><br></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>
