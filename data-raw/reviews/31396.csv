<p>The built was fast and uncomplicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No special Parts which imo is a plus to alter the model.</p>

<p>The image on the polybag is made in such a way that the Points mentioned below are not that visible.</p>

<p>unfortunately it&#39;s a bad representation of the Batmobile:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wheels are to small giving an odd Stance of the model</li>
	<li>Gaps in the wheel wells.</li>
	<li>Big Gap between the front cover and the lights which kills the looks of the front part.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>

<p>Only buy this if you&#39;re a big DC fan, others can spent the little money this kit costs in a better way.</p>
