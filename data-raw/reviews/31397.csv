"Krutak","2022-10-29T13:32:32.64Z","Good Mario set (at least polybag)","<p>30389&nbsp;Fuzzy&nbsp;&amp; Mushroom Platform&nbsp;is a second&nbsp;Lego Super Mario polybag, which started to sell in summer of 2021, when 3rd&nbsp;wave of sets (including 73187&nbsp;Adventures with Luigi) launched.</p>

<p>The build features 4x4&nbsp;rounded yellow&nbsp;plate on which is Star Block&nbsp;with 1x1 pyramid rigged tile 1X1X2/3 which connects with 4x4 rounded green plate with a 4x4 orange plate with 1x1 rounded tiles on slope bricks and 2x2 bricks by 2x6 blue plate with a coral and two flowers on it. Fuzzy floats&nbsp;atop of mushroom., there&#39;s Super Mushroom.</p>

<p>With star block, you can defeat any enemy with one stomp, and it gives you a LOT of coins. Fuzzy has standard one live.</p>

<p>Super Star also allows you to walk about lava, but it will be better if the gameplay changes as I suggest (See my 30385 Super Mushroom Surprise review).</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a very nice Lego Super Mario set. It&#39;s great expansion to your&nbsp;Lego Super Mario world. I recommend it 110%!</p>
