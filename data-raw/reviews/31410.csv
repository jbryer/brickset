<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>This foil pack is the new version introduced in 2020, which I&#39;ve already covered in my previous review.&nbsp;On the front you can see an action shot of Lloyd with his sword and shield. There is nothing interesting on the back.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>The assembly is very simple, since the set consists of only one minifigure and two weapons.&nbsp;The instructions are inside the magazine and are easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure pieces, the parts aren&#39;t anything to write home about. None of them are new or exclusive, but the transparent lime green Kopaka sword and metallic gold dish are fairly uncommon and are nice to get in such a cheap set. It&#39;s also the cheapest way to get a transparent lime green flame piece, which was introduced in the Master of the Mountain set wave.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The character which we get this month is Lloyd in his Spinjitzu Burst form. He looks pretty good, but the fact that his torso is in a different colour compared to the rest of the minifig looks a bit weird and some people may not like that. He also reuses the legs from his Legacy 2 version, and hood from the Season 10 suit. The only parts unique to Burst Lloyd are his torso and head. The face is actually identical to the one which he has been using since the Ninjago Movie, but this time it&#39;s printed on a green head and has glowing eyes. He also has no alternate expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a side note, this version of Lloyd is completely non-canon to the show. Lloyd never uses Spinjitzu Burst in Master of the Mountain or in any other canon media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lloyd comes with a sword, which like I&#39;ve mentioned before looks very similar to Kopaka&#39;s sword from Bionicle, and a golden shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Because this set only includes one character, the playability aspect is very poor. The only play value here are the puzzles and games included in the magazine.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So, should you buy this one? If you are a completionist and you don&#39;t have Burst Lloyd already, or if you just like how he looks, I&#39;d say go for it. However, since this version of Lloyd never appears in the series, he isn&#39;t necessarily a must-have, and you can easily pass on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
