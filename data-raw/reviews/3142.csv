"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-08T23:01:47Z","Excellent ship!","What a ship! The ship is very detailed and there is plenty of playability. This is a ship with style!

For example, the skull, &quot;woodwork&quot;, and windows at the stern is precise and pleasing to the eye. The skull at the back is well thought out as well as the cabin area at the back. There is space underneath the first mast and open area on the deck. The height/location of the sails is NOT a problem. The sails are more likely to catch high winds where they are. Someone complained about how high the sails are: maybe they're higher on purpose because it leaves a lot of space for playing down on the deck. The other ships have sails that are WAY TOO close to the cannons and the floor of the deck. No space to play!

Someone said the Skull's Eye Schooner was a little fragile. The Runner is as sturdy as a rock. The 'battle damage' is not wimpy or fragile. Don't like that? Just clamp it down with a block and stop complaining.

The +++ (pluses) of this set are the 3 pirate 'animals', the diverse crew (the elusive tattooed chest and 2 black hat rags!!!), the 'stand-alone' sails, rowboat, amount of weapons, the fish net, and a great selection of blocks/colors. About the sails: not only are they cool, but these sails actually can be raised or lowered!!! Can the Black Seas Barracuda or the Skull's Eye Schooner do THAT?!!

The --- (minues) of this set are the complicated instructions, the lack of an anchor, and a need for an extra cannon.

This set does NOT need extra treasure (it has the same amount of treasure like in all the other pirate sets) and does NOT need an 'extra' pirate. I think 7 minifigs is fine (although a female pirate would've been cool to have). People say the Skull's Eye Schooner has 9 minifigs so this set needs a lot of minifigs. Who cares?! People also say this set has a 'low' amount of blocks: who cares?!

It took me a little over 3 hours to build this ship (believe me, it was a pleasure!). One last word: if a set is totally fun to build, then the set must be good enough for a rate of 9 or 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-11T04:38:59Z","this is the worst of all pirate ships.","The sails are really really awkwardly and badly designed. It looks like a giraffe. Also the white round parts on the sides of the ship looks a bit unrealistic. Yeah, the sails can be raised and lowered ,which means that 2 more sails MUST have been put. Since they can be set and lowered, you could have playability on the deck by lowering the sails. By the way it has the worst color scheme. My personal favorite is Barracuda, then Schooner and unfortunately this isnt my third choice either but since there is no other ships lego produced i had to buy also this one , but i am not satisfied with this ship since it is such a strange boat.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T12:44:33Z","cool but fragile","This is actully a cool ship but i first look at this ship en after that to the black seas barracuda i also own that one and I think that barracuda is much more fun! I've heard that someone says that this ship is so sturdy like a rock but NO this ship is not realy strong: when a was at my room this ship was standing at a plank above me, then my little sister came and start bothering me, i little string fell on my shoulder. I pull on hit en KABOOM richt on my head: in more then 100 pieces. This was the end of my ship he is sunken on my own head! The ship haves very rare pieces in my own lego collection so i was too late to rebuilt this set and arrgh it was three years ago but i'm still very mad on my little sister that almast kielhaul her!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T21:08:13Z","you all stink!","this is a great set? why are you crazy wombats giving it 1's and 3's? the masts are not too high, they would probably catch more wind up there anyways. and it gives you more playing space on the deck of the boat. it has good minifigs and the skull in the back is awesome. the falling mast and captain's cabin were annoying, but if you hate those features, just put a brick over them and stop whining.
parts of mine broke to pieces when i moved, but that allowed me to hake a higher mast in the back with a crow's nest. i also was able to add two cannons in the front of the boat, so that it doesnt have to expose its long side in order to attack imperial guards. 
it could use more cannons, though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-21T23:09:53Z","Hold up now!","What's with all the bad reviews?  This is an excellent pirate ship!  My first ever.  Perfect design and fun features, with lots of minifigs.

'Looks like a giraffe'... pfft.  Brickset needs to quality control reviews. ;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-31T05:38:54Z","Who cant like this","This is one of my favorite lego sets it was a fun build it looks great and its absolutely fabulous. One of the greatest things is that there are so many minifigs included. I also find that everybody that likes this set has a great reason to do so. how could you not like it!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-12T10:19:56Z","Sail awaaaaay....","This ship has been the latest adition to my rather big fleet of 11 ships, and I must say, at fist I thought it was terrible. especially the sails are bad in my opinion, and the ship is fragile I think. however this last is easely compensated with some extra bricks. (like someone said before) however the sails are killing this ship off in my opinion.  This ship only has 2 big and one small sail. the holes in the sail are terrible. what pirate would sail with broken sails? :S  (not even to mention the Pirate signatures on the sails...every freighter would see the sails and run... oh no thy don't have to run, this ship only has 2 sails so is as slow as a turtle on land)


Not that I hate turtles, but I rather have something faster :P so I took the sails off, burned them, and replaced the sails with home made sails. even increased the sails so there are 2 &quot;main&quot; sails on every mast. and some smaller sails on the back of the mast. And only with those extra sails I would think it is a good capable ship who can stand her ground (or run like hell) in a fight with some of my armada ships.

now for the rest of the ship. 
- the back of the ship is really cool :)
- there is an nice ammount of minifigs on the ship.
- the ship can hold up to 8!!! cannons (though ya have to buy those extra cannons) an 8 cannon battleship can ruin every ship the Imperials throw at you!!
-enough bricks. it took me some 1.5 hour to build it and I loved it.

in short: it is a good ship, however I think it to be the least of the Big ships. I would have given it a 10/10 if it had normal sails in an adequate number.however it has not normal adequate sails, so it has to do with an 7 :P",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"OWF","2008-09-10T23:29:54.747Z","In TOP 10 from all time","As pirate ship, it isn't such a big one like Skull's Eye Schooner of Barracuda but not all the time the biggest it's also the best.
Following instructions, the result it isn't very good because the sails are placed in the top, and the base of pole remains empty, but Lego is not just to follow original instructions, so we can use the pieces to create our own creation.

That's why this ship is the best from Pirate theme:

The base ship is red instead of brown.
Sails are broken by canons, this make the ship more realistic and more Pirate.
The back side of the ship represent a skull, the best back from all ships.

This set it's a must have for any Lego collector.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"UFO_and_Insectoids","2009-12-22T01:39:57.153Z","AMAZING pirate ship!","This is another set I saved and saved for and had a lot of fun with. Complete with chambers, traps, and even a falling mass! This set in my opinion makes a perfect addition to the pirate series.

Pros:
*Great pirate minifigures including Captain Redbeard
*Falling mass/sail
*Cabin underneath ship
*Cool fish net
*Extra boat

Cons:
*Really none that comes to mind!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pendy","2010-12-13T21:47:25.427Z","Great pirate ship, but a little lacking.","i've owned this set for about 8 years i think, and growing up it was by far the biggest set i owned and could actually play with. As a kid, i couldnt of asked for anymore, it was fun to play with as it had features like the collapsible stern and sail and it was very easy to build on (the flat part of the bow makes it really easy to build your own gun turrets).<br><br>As i became older though, the lack of details in comparison to the bsb and ses really played on my mind. a friend of mine had the re-release of the bsb and i remember i was forever jealous of him beacuse it made the rbr look a little unfinished and undersized. this is where the problem lies for the rbr, although, by itself, it is an excelent ship, when you compare it to the likes of the ses and bsb, it will always seem a little underdone. <br><br>Another thing that it is important to remember about the ship is that it is far more suited to be played with as opposed for display. It has the features like the collapsible mast and stern because it's designed to be played with by kids. i believe this is also the reason it was left a little unfinished with no real interior or decking, the designer wanted the owner to fill those bits in themselves, to make it their own i guess.<br><br>So in conclusion, as a set you play with i rate this a 5/5, as a kid i built so many variations and had so much fun having sea battles between it and the other boats i owned that i cant really think of a set that i would of prefered to have grown up with. As a display set however, it lacks a bit due to its size compared to other pirate ships and it's lack of detail. in saying that though, i do use it as a display set now, but it's only about 40% original, and i don't own any other large pirate ships just yet (although i have the imperial flagship on laybuy).<br><br>list of pros and cons just so you get an overall idea of what its like i guess:<br><br>Pros: <br><ul><li>easy to build on to</li><li>fun to play with</li><li>great started ship, it was good to have the hull, sails and masts so i could build other ships</li><li>good sized crew</li><li><br></li></ul>Cons:<ul><li>lack of detail</li><li>smaller than bsb and ses</li><li>only three canons</li><li>only 3 sails</li></ul>In terms of value as well, i think my parents payed $180AUD for it, which is pretty good imo considering that the imperial flagship retails for $280AUD (although i found mine on sale for $210) and i would definately of payed more for the set at the time. i have seen one on ebay (maybe the 1996 model) with a starting bid of $50AUD which i thought was an absolute bargain, especially considering nobody have even bid on it yet, so i'd assume that you could find one now for less than what i payed.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
