Kids will really love playing with the rocket which can actually hold Mickey and Minnie inside as they travel around. The hull of the rocket is made of two large pieces that join together. The interior has studs to add decorations and accessories. The rocket will swoosh well for kids and adults alike.</span></span></p>

<p>Both Mickey and Minnie are wearing identical spacesuits that are printed on the front and back of the torso.&nbsp; There&#39;s an inconspicuous &quot;hidden Mickey&quot; on the back.&nbsp; The legs have matching printed details as well.&nbsp; These will make great companions to Classic Space figs or other space minifigures in your collection.&nbsp; Mickey and Minnie use the same head pieces; the only difference is that Minnie has printed eyelashes and a red bow piece on top.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The little spaceport is obviously easy to build, but it has some nice features with the control panel and video monitor. If you&#39;re a Disney collector or aficionado, you will enjoy the Mickey silhouett piece that is new to this series. There is a device to contain or inspect the transparent crystal piece. The device can open to allow the crystal to be removed and other pieces put in. (No, not Mickey&#39;s head you sick-o!) </span></span>A trans-bright-green boulder can house another crystal and a little three-piece alien that has a really fun face print.</p>

<p>With only 88 pieces in this set, it&#39;s not a great value but obviously a lot of that goes into the rocket hull and base plates.&nbsp; However, this is the only set with these minfigures and the new rocket pieces.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a huge Disney fan, but I see the obvious draw this will have on them.&nbsp; I really like this set and would recommend it to Disney or space fans.&nbsp;</p>
