It was probabably one of the best sets in pirate range when it was first released in 1996 when the pirate Lego was getting worse and near to its end. The only things that let this set down are not enough figures and that the ship could be bigger so that there could be more rotating cannons. But again this was when less sets of each range were being made especially the Imperial Armada and Imperial Guards sets. Overall still a great set for today. Glad they released it again.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T12:54:20Z","heheh","This is a pretty cool set and the armada guys are cool but three is too less the. Turning cannon is really cool and the collapsing mast is also cool.I've built a captains cabin underneath the reer deck and build another armada guy. I took a french imperial soldier give him a captains hat and made him captain of this ship. This was my first ship and this was my review and good-bye!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-11T16:06:00Z","another great galleon","if you read my review of Imperial Flagship, you will know why i think that this boat is the right size. but that is no excuse for the lack of figures. i would give it a ten if it had two more Spanish soldiers, and they were different, because there are only three different kinds and none of them look higher in rank, so you have to make your own admiral, captain, and sailor. i used to have Perilous Pitfall, and now can only find the jail door made of javelins, the baseplate, the battlement section that connects to the rising bridge, the sail, the cannon, some figures, the crown, and the two Spanish soldiers. this sounds like a long list, but it's really not, and the set is much bigger. it was destroyed by the housekeeper. but that's okay because i have the power of Forbidden Island. anyways, i made the two soliders sailors aboard this ship. also, the creature feature is sucky. it doesn't even have a common shark. it could really use one. but the sails are still beautiful.
Really nice. the collapsing mast in the back is much cooler than the one in Red Beard Runner, because when you  actualy make it collapse, it doesn't handicap the boat as much. i put a brick on the RBR mast, but not on this one. however, the sail in the back looks a bit out of place, even though it is a nice sail. the flag is actually quite large. as opposed to having some stompy flag that is hard and unflagishful like, it is a nice cloth one with a nice emblem on it. 
the cannon is amazing. it's ingenous. it makes up for the lack of cannons. it has one of the coolest bases, a green base, and it swivels around freely instead of you having to pull the cannon out, carefully close the saltwater guard flag, turn it around, open the other flag, and put in the cannon (*cough* Red Beard Runner *cough*). it is a nice feature. also, the &quot;cabin&quot; in the back of the boat is pretty cool and spacious, even though no privacy could be attained in there. the front storage space is too cramped and useless in pretty much every Lego boat. the crane is great, and you don't even have to do that complicated procedure of licking the string and carefully pushing it through these narrow-as-a-wombat's-armpit holes and then tieing/tying/whatever the string into an unsuccessful knot that you have to tie over and over again. the steering wheel looks cool, almost like it used to be a working one like  in Imperial Flagship. after all, it used to be a regularly produced set, not a Lego Legend. this is a very nice set. if you see it, try to buy it, especially if you have more soldiers. you'll be glad you did.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-11T18:39:35.373Z","Conquistadors","This is a pretty cool ship for the Armada theme. I really like the Spanish conquistador minifigs which look very cool. Although it is small, you can still get two of these for the cost of a pirate ship. This is a great set and deserved to be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jack75","2008-11-23T13:01:35.03Z","One of the best pirate ships ever","My neighbor has this set, and were in the middle of rebuilding it. I'd have to say, its very cool. The design is very smart. It has a rudder, steering wheel, a crew of 3, a cannon, cannon ammo, cargo hold (rather small, but its good), and a working sail system. But there is 1 downside, the lack of cannons as it only has 1. I mean, as a flagship, it should have at least 4 cannons. This is more of a warship. Ships like the Skull's Eye Schooner, (I will have a review soon) is more like a flagship, but this is still worth buying.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Armada","2010-10-02T17:16:14.837Z","Spainard Ship!","This set was totaly awesome! I love the neat rotating cannon and the net!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1) Three cool Spanish Armada minifigures.<br/>2) A cool cannon that spins in any direction.<br/>3) Unique flags that look totaly awesome.<br/>Cons: <br/>1) Only one cannon.<br/><br/>Over-all rating: Five Stars<br/>Still a&nbsp;sick set even though it only has one cannon.",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5
"pendy","2010-12-19T09:46:43.323Z","a great budget pirate themed set","i got this set soon after i got the red beard runner around 8 years ago. as a kid, i was really hoping that this set would be like a smaller version of the rbr in terms of its playability, as i found the rbr very easy to build on to and overall just a great set to play with.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>unfortunately, i was a little disappointed. the ship&nbsp;itself&nbsp;is great, but i just never had as much fun with it as i did with the rbr, its too small to add onto without it becoming over crowded and with only 1 cannon and 3 crew, its hardly a match for the rbr when i comes to on sea battles (something i was very keen to recreate when i bought this set).</div><div><br></div><div>it was also a pretty quick build, i&nbsp;remember&nbsp;i took me around 6 hours to finish the rbr, where as this only took me around 1-1:30 hours. it does come with some cool pieces though, such as the curved railing on the bow, the blue on white trap door and the chrome chest piece for a minifig.</div><div><br></div><div>i think the reason i never fully enjoyed this set was because i was always comparing it to the rbr, i think if i owned this set and not the rbr, it would have been more than enough. its still bigger than most of my other boats and it does look fantastic, its just not as impressive as the rbr. this is especially&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;now as i've grown out of playing with lego and use it more for display. when i put this along side my (modified) rbr, its nearly dwarfed by it and i always think if i had two of these i could make a really cool ocean battle scene.</div><div><br></div><div>a few of the boats redeeming qualities are the rotatable cannon, a great feature that works really well, and the crest printed on the main sail. its a very cool&nbsp;addition, it looks really neat and makes the boat look far more detailed than what it actually is.</div><div><br></div><div>the final thing that i really liked was the price, i think i paid about $60AUD for the set, which&nbsp;compared&nbsp;to the $180AUD the rbr cost my parents, is a great deal. the price on bricklink now is pretty cheap, and its well worth it in my opinion.</div><div><br></div><div>i realise my review does focus on a lot of negatives, but as i said i just can't help but compare the set to the rbr. i just had so much fun with that set that i was really hoping this would be the same, but it just never lived up to it. the set is still great, but could be improved with another&nbsp;cannon and an extra crew member. i would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;recommend this set if your after a pirate themed ship on a tight budget, but if you can afford it, nothing beats one of the big ones.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
