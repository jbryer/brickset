I lost an Islander only a week after I got this set, but I still have fun with it. I've built it up a little, but I think keeping it in its original form is better, and I will probably rip the extra level and bridge down soon. I like the animal skin pillow thing that the pirates have over at their mini-base, and I have never seen it in another set. Plenty of Islander weapons, plus a treasure chest behind upward swinging palm leaves. I rigged the mast on the pirate boat to fall down  like the Red Beard Runner's, though it is at random and unexpected times when it does.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Enchanted Island is probably one of the best bases available, following only the Imperial Trading Post and possibly the Eldorado Fortress.  WHere can I begin?

1. The Structure - this set uses two seperate plates, with one that is really &quot;built-Up&quot; to create the effect of rocks and mountains.  There are two main structures connected with a bridge that can collapse on unsuspecting pirates.  They use sloped roofs with several palm fronds to create a very effective &quot;jungle effect.&quot;  There is also a very impressive statue that can serve as a hiding place for an Islander mini-fig.  

2. The Minifigs - Don't you hate when you have to buy several sets to get enough minifigs?  This particular set comes with a virtual ARMY of Islanders!  You get King Kahuka himself, along two other types of Islander figs.  I don't remember the number, but it is enough to fill the island out nicely.  You also get several pirates to invade the peaceful tranquility of the island.

3. The Accessories - I am including the two ships with the accessories listed.  The first one is a pirate rowboat, but it comes with two sails so that it almost becomes like a small ship instead.  The second ship is an Islander canoe with sail and a stabilizer on one side.  They are both really nice.  The figures come with plenty of bows, arrows, shields, and spears.  Everybody gets plenty of weapons (obviously this was made before Lego started getting so stingy with their pieces!)  King Kahuka gets a throne that can be carried around by two willing Islanders. There is also a nice animal skin drum and a campfire with a little pot!
 
All in all, Enchanted Island is probably the finest of the Islander lego sets from the mid-90s.  I would recommend this to any Pirate lego-fanatic, but I would also encourage people who enjoy PLAYING with their sets to look seriously at this one.  It is definately a fine addition to any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-10T14:47:03Z","Great !!","This set had so many good features and pieces. I loved the mini pirate ship that came. The theme was good as well and had a nice twist to the whole pirate theme in general. Lego did well releasing this again. Its just a pity that Lego don't put their sets in their original boxes anymore with all the nice inserts, posters, lift up flaps, all of their alternate models and their catalogues from the time. Lego have really got to put back all the previous models from 1996 and backwards (AND PUT THEM BACK INTO THEIR ORIGINAL BOXES AGAIN WITH ALL THE INSERTS, POSTERS, CATALOGUES, LIFT UP FLAPS AND ALL THEIR ALTERNATE MOBELS AGAIN!!) and get rid of all the rubbish ones today to really get back into the market to attract loads of attention again. If this ever did happen everybody would not have to bid so much money and wait for ages for somebody to get in the set they want brand new. If people keep saying this to Lego and Lego realises that WE ARE RIGHT!! You never know they could do it then everybody will be happy again. I will. It will mean that we won't have to spend an arm and a leg on just on set like we are at the moment. Remember, anything is possible!! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-26T19:51:24.707Z","No wonder they re-released it","This has always been one of my favourite Lego sets. It may not be the fortress that the other trading posts and castles were, but it is just as big, if not bigger and has some great features like the bridge, the statue and the leaves to hide the treasure behind.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dengar215","2009-02-16T15:00:33.937Z","I miss this set so much!","This is one of my favorite lego sets, but it's the set I have with the most missing pieces!

Pros:
Cool minifigs,
great setup,
colorful.

Cons:
None.


It would be my dream to play with this set agian with all the pieces.  I hope it comes true.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
