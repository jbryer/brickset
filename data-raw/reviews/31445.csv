Since I&#39;m a huge friends fan, I really liked the look of this set, but I was disappointed with how the interior was bare and lacking. Buying this set, I had low&nbsp;expectations, but boy was I wrong! This set was great!</p>

<p>First&nbsp;of all, the building experience was separated in 4 bags, which made me feel I was getting more for my money. The set also had a beautiful colour scheme which made me feel relaxed every time I saw it.</p>

<p>The Build was intricate yet well-paced, I did not feel bored at any time of the build and the details in this set are incredible! I appreciated all the greenery and thought out in the set! Especially love the new raccoon and hot pink kayak!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Beautiful exterior</p>

<p>Great building experience</p>

<p>New Raccoon and kayak</p>

<p>Great figures (Love that this set had 3)</p>

<p>Pretty design</p>

<p>Value</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Lacking interior</p>

<p>Ugly butterfly sticker on the tree (Optional)</p>

<p>Space on the upstairs too small</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I am thoroughly pleased with this set and I am glad to have it!</p>
