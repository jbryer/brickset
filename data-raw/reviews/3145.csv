IT OWNS YOU ALLLL!!!!!!!!!!","this set is ssooooooooossssssssssssoooooooooooooooogreat. it is the wreck of what appears to be a small ship with a skull in the back, just like Red Beard Runner. i shall start with the accssories.

it comes with a awesome raft with an oar for the rudder. the raft is cute and awesome. it has two piratews, but no captain, so you can put one of your billion Captain Redbeards on it. it comes with a Spanish conquistador (i like them, so shut up) and a primitive crane. this type is used in Armada Flagship, and it is much easier to use than the older ones with tons of string, even though those were a ton better. the crane holds a net that can either lower prisoners into the water and leave them there over night, or load treasure onto a boat.

this set has great features, like a stand in the back of the boat, right inside the skull, (which looks kinda funny) and when you press down on a panel, it will launch the stand into the air - along with anyone who happened to be on the stand at that time. there is a hidden compartment underneath the rotating cannon that holds weapons and a map (in the instructions). but don't put them there. they would all sink to the bottom, because underneath that cannon system is water. Lego does this to so many sets. great   trap doors, but they have water underneath them. the cannon system is great. the holder is the blue type, it's one of a kind, making it rare, and this whole set is rare. that means that the blue holder is rare to the second power. the green holder used in Armada Flagship is green and awesome, but it's not as rare. the holder is just awesome. the set is awesome. chances are, you won't be able to find one on ebay any more. anyWAYS, there is a blue lantern hanging from a pole attached to the side of the skull. it is blue and looks cool. 
in case you were wondering, the ship seems to have sunk against some large rock. part of it is included in the set, but the box doesn't show the brig on the other side. the mast is great, with a rare red-and-white striped battle scarred sail with a black Jolly Roger. it is almost as rare as the blue cannon holder, but it is also available in Perilous Pitfall, which i would have reviewed, but it was destroyed when i was young. the bottom of the sail is very ripped, and, now, it wouldn't be able to catch any wind. that makes the set more cool. there is a palm tree on a little crest of sand sticking out of the water, and it shouldn't be there. the tree should be on a bigger sand  bar like in Imperial Outpost. but is a great set. the front of the boat has a hand cannon for fending off small enemy boats.  great set.

i use the set as a hidout for my second group of pirates led by Captain Deadshank. they use it to develop plans and as a warehouse for treasure. treasure that they recover is whisked off to their warehouse higher up on the rock island. there is really no big warehouse, but it would be cool if there were. when a big galleon is sighted in the distance, the pirates quickly take the hand gun, take down the sail, lower the crane completely, hide the cannon, and, of course, stash the treasure, then go and hide behind a rock. once the ship is gone, they come back out, and continue planning how to take down Eldorado Fortress.

personallly, i love this set. get it, you won't be disapointed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"aplbomr","2007-11-22T01:46:37.03Z","Grasping at the great sets","This was a set where Lego tried to relive it's great past, but fell miserably short.  Instead of creating a completely new set, it was more like an also-build to a more complete set.  Disappointing for Lego standards.  However, I will give them credit for using existing pieces instead of inventing new ones in order to invent new sets (as is now the norm for the boorish new sets... i.e. Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc.)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2010-07-14T01:34:36.477Z","Nice set.","<p>An original and unusual set, this is the guts of a marooned pirate ship.&nbsp; There's still a mast, a cannon and various other features such as a place to hide the treasure, a crane with a fishing net and a cell containing a skeleton (or a scarvy swab, if you prefer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also comes with a raft, which is well-designed and a nice change from the usual barrel design, and an extra Spanish Armada minifig is always welcome.</p>

"legoman4694","2008-05-10T16:07:40.2Z","nice","it is very cool how this set has a catapult and it is fun to fling the figures. the sail is also cool how it looks ripped up. also there is a third figure that comes with this set that is not shown here 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-26T04:10:31.52Z","LEGO Pirates - Shipwreck Island Review","Now this set looks really cool. It is a fun and easy built and the whole set is very sturdy. You also won't have to complain about stickers. We get a brown raft which looks really cool and we also get a green crocodile. You also can't complain about the number of minifigs which comes with this model. For some reason you can see only 3 minifigs on the front of the instruction but we actually get 4 minifigs.<br><br>The design of this model looks really cool. I like the way how LEGO did the jail and the big pirate flag. There's also a catapult which shoots out the treasure chest. The wreck looks really fantastic and we also get a canon which does shoot out the canon balls and we also get a nice palm tree. I think this set is a neat collector's item and I really can't complain about this model.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
