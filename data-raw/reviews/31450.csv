<p>This set I picked up on sale, so it was well worth the 1/2 price that I got it at, but there is so much going on with it that I can see the original price as a bit pricey but it is at same level as similar sized sets.</p>

<p>Some of the building was more complex for my daughter, but she is younger than the recommended box age of 8+. She did manage a lot of the smaller components herself and helped out with the bigger stuff. It took a couple of hours to build everything.</p>

<p>Of course the main attraction was the roller coaster, complete with cute Bunny cars, and great satisfaction when get to the final dip and it can go itself to bottom. The only thing is the archways can be bit tight, have to make sure the bunny ears are down, and realised a minidoll had to remove her cat ears hairband to fit through properly, but this is a minor complaint.</p>

<p>The other twisty ride, is fine, my daughter gets fun twisting dolls around very fast, but is probably the least interesting thing of the set.</p>

<p>The Big Top has lots of cool details, and mechanisms. There is the Bunny that comes out of top hat, the spinning stage as well as spinning signs to show who is on. There&#39;s a make up station behind and popcorn and photo booth thing. Love the little details here where the photos are one of those photos you get on roller-coaster and indeed on the back of one of the archways of the roller-coaster is a camera!</p>

<p>My daughter was big fan of the tricks that it came with,a secret cabinet where you can make doll &quot;disappear&quot; and also a magic box with a disappearing jewel. Other small additions like balloon stand, flame stick and adjustable seats, make the set quite satisfying. If I had one complaint it&#39;s the little set of juggling pens can&#39;t actually be held by the minidolls.</p>

<p>But overall really enjoyable build, lots of fun to play with after, my daughter gets great fun with all her other minidolls visiting the fair.</p>
