There&#39;s no coherent theme or, in my opinion, colour scheme that unifies this parts bag (compare Dots 4, which let you build funny / goofy faces). There&#39;s also no innovative tiles (look for Dots 3 if you want really new ideas). The prints are dull and hard to think of uses, even in the context of a Dots bracelet or box -- the closest to tiles that work together are the two rainbow-on-black tiles. I mean, that avocado tile might be good for trolling Millenials, but seriously, there&#39;s no reason you really need this bag unless you&#39;re a completionist and want the entire series.</p>

I like the brightly coloured tiles and they colours go well together. There are some fun prints like the earth with a smile and the rainbow star and wi-fi signal. But the highlight of this series is the 10+ glow-in-the-dark round tiles that come in each bag. I can&#39;t think of many other ways to easily get a bunch of glowing pieces, and I&#39;m excited to use them in MOCs and mosaics.</p>

<p>This set has a number of really creative printed dots.&nbsp; I wish Lego put all of the printed dots in each bag but these are supposed to have an element of surprise to see which dots you got.&nbsp; In fact, Lego doesn&#39;t even show all of the printed dots available in the promotional pictures on the set page of their website.&nbsp; Luckily, there is a clear window on the front of the bag that lets you preview what&#39;s inside.&nbsp; I&#39;m extremely grateful for that reason.</p>

<p>My bag contained 16 glow in the dark dots.&nbsp; It had two of the printed palm trees and one of each of the following: ocean wave, peace sign hand, pencil, zebra stripes, leopard spots, lightning bolt, &quot;+1&quot; heart, and one with the words &quot;player two&quot; printed on it.&nbsp; The set also includes 19 quarter-circle tiles in bright green, bright yellow, bright orange, medium azure, and 19 bright violet dots.&nbsp; There is a definite coastal or fruity vibe with the pack.&nbsp; I really quite like it.&nbsp; The only thing stopping me from buying more than one bag was that the store only had one bag left of the Series 5 Dots when I realised how fun the set is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m recommending this set to any AFOL that needs the glow in the dark dots or the ocean themed printed tiles.</p>
