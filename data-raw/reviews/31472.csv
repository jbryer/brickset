<p>Samurapper is the second of the Series 1 Band Mates and, if I am honest with myself, one of the least enjoyable. The character has impressive printing for the torso and legs making him look like a decent on-stage singer, but there is nothing about this design that looks remotely Samurai enough for the character. He also includes a LEGO oxygen mask for breaking for some reason that defies understanding.</p>

<p>The strange and quirky designs of the characters are a huge draw, but in the case of Samurapper I fear LEGO didn&#39;t go far enough when conceiving the character. The version I am reviewing includes a printed Teal tile with a large gong on it, a printed yellow tile with a LEGO version of what can only be Austin Powers dancing on it and a dark maroonish tile with a mummy waving on it.</p>

<p>The parts and print of the torso and legs really sell this character, but the odd choices for the accessories do it a disservice. Overall, I would mildly recommend it for the parts alone, but it&#39;s probably the least impressive from the first batch of Band Mates. Mildly Recommended.</p>
