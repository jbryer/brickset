"8BrickMario","2021-03-15T15:12:43.62Z","Okay. I'll bite.","<p>This was the second minifigure I got from my first pull of three Bandmates boxes and wasn&#39;t one I was seeking out. What do I think of it&nbsp;anyway?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>As a consequence of the blind boxes, this figure was unexpected. See my Genie Dancer review for more thoughts and advice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Shark Singer&#39;s parts are fun but highly specialized and limited. The torso and legs aren&#39;t going to be useful until we get more heads in the teal color, that&#39;s for sure. The BeatBit tile you&#39;re guaranteed to get with this figure&nbsp;is the seagull with the guitar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>(For thoughts on the stand, see my Genie Dancer review)</p>

<p>I wrote this entire review without knowing this character was female. I only found out by finding her bio, which proves one great thing: LEGO has finally created a nonhuman female character with no stereotypical signifiers! I&#39;m glad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Shark Singer is one of the wackier characters, but she&#39;s also a really fun one and an appealing design. She&#39;s a punk tiger shark with a spiky mohawk, what else do you want? The head is a new piece vaguely similar to both the Shark Warrior head from Atlantis and the Shark Suit mask from the Minifigures theme, but this is a full head and a rather large one. Her&nbsp;face is enjoyably aggressive but looks fun, and I enjoy the choice to make her&nbsp;a tiger shark with her jagged darker stripes. She has no visible makeup. She has a Vibrant Coral mohawk dual-molded in and her&nbsp;fins are torn and scarred, which is a nice touch. Her&nbsp;torso is printed with a very detailed outfit, featuring a leather vest with shell and starfish symbols and safety pins over a sagging white tank top and heavy belt while she wears a chain necklace with a skull-and-crossbones pendant. Notably, she&#39;s not feminized with a human woman&#39;s figure, which is refreshing because sharks don&#39;t have breasts and design choices like that are&nbsp;understandably criticized as sexist. Her torn shorts have a striped scarf tied around them and she has steel-toed boots, while the back of her vest features a punk pirate-captain skull with its tongue sticking out. I love the pirate touches, which I assume are to pair her&nbsp;with the Punk Pirate figure. The colors also work out really well. She&#39;s just fun to look at.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>Of the characters I wasn&#39;t seeking out, this is definitely one of the better ones to have wound up with. I also applaud the fact that LEGO finally dared to make a female nonhuman without resorting to any kind of signifiers after their trend of aggressively denoting female characters with stereotyped traits in the past. Good on them. Even if the bios were written independently of the character design process, somebody out there decided to make her a female character and I appreciate it.</p>

<p>The shark is made with a new head piece using a shark&#39;s entire body shrunken down to fit on a Minifigure torso, the tail hangs down like a long head of hair or something and the dorsal fin sticks out in back just below the mohawk. It&#39;s all a dark green in colour with tiger strips and a huge tooth filled grin. His torso is black with the same colour green for the arms and hands, it features pirate print cues with a skull and crossbones silver necklace on the front and a skull with Pirate hat on the back sticking its tongue out. Zippers and a safety pin make up the rest of the front vest design while the legs have a sash for a belt, fish bones, a fishhook and steel tipped shoes.</p>

<p>The tiles included with the one I am reviewing feature a dark green tile with a saxophone player, a bright orange tile with a duck playing an acoustic guitar and a lime green tile showing flames raining from the sky. As these tiles are randomly packaged yours may vary. Lastly he includes a microphone accessory.</p>

<p>Overall this Minifigure is pure brilliance, it introduces a great looking concept and blends together all the diverse elements quite nicely. I wouldn&#39;t say no to seeing something like this in that Masked Singer show, in fact a lot of these Minifigures would make excellent stand-ins for a LEGO version of that property. As far as Shark Singer is concerned, I Highly Recommend him.</p>
