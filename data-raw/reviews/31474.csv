<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>DJ Cheetah&#39;s parts are nearly all limited to the figure as designed, though the pants and record can be taken out of context. His guaranteed BeatBit tile has the dancing-minifigure-over-stripes background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure. Yikes.</h3>

<p>What an ugly character design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head of DJ Cheetah is shared with the Red Panda Dancer, though that figure is leagues more appealing to me. The first huge problem with this guy is the blue color. It&#39;s garish and doesn&#39;t go with the yellow, green, and pink, and it&#39;s absurd as a secondary fur color for a cheetah. The blue hair is annoying enough, but the use of blue for his spots looks much worse and I can&#39;t come around to&nbsp;it. His face also rubs me the wrong way, being a bad combination of edgy-dude and cutesy animal. His outfit almost works for me, and would be fine on a different figure. The green jacket and pink pants are a fun combo, with the jacket having sparkles and the pants having sequins, and the badge and necklace are a fun touch. I also admire that the figure features no teal, magenta, or Vibrant Coral but still achieves the retro look.&nbsp;He&#39;s meant to be wearing the jacket open over his bare chest, which could be fun, but the thin paint on his torso really harms the effect and makes it hard to see.&nbsp;He has a cheetah tail ruined by the blue spots. I like the record tile he comes with, being a blue color with a palm tree image on it. But in the end, the colors, the character concept, and the bad design choices leave me with no way to escape the idea that DJ Cheetah is a furry. And I have no beef with people who consider themselves furries and don&#39;t care what they do...but&nbsp;<em>man</em>&nbsp;does that community have some cringeworthy try-hard &quot;unique/cool&quot; animal character designs and this guy fits right in, tacky colors, edgy cute-boy look and all. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re like this, DJ Cheetah.</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>Even the most careful Bandmates buying cannot spare you from this figure. Buyer beware. (But also, it&#39;s like, just a toy I think is ugly. Not a life-ruiner. Go for it if you want.)</p>

<p>This Band Mate is a nice addition to the overall line with limited use of unique parts, his torso print features a sweater with an interesting cybernetic design which kind of looks like stylised circuit board printing. He includes the tail element we&#39;ve seen on previous cat themed Minifigures with a printed blue spot marking and a dual-mold black tip. His head is a unique element with a cat&#39;s head featuring shocking electric blue hair, matching blue spots for the Cheetah design and some interesting use of black for accentuated detailing around the ears and top of the head.</p>

<p>There&#39;s little to say about his pants, the print works well for him. His accessory is a printed round tile with a record design showing a tropical palm tree design in the centre. The three tiles included with the only copy I managed to get is the same dark teal with the Saxophone player that I just noted came with one of my Shark Singers, a yellow tile with a Minifigure appearing to be dancing some kind of Latin beat style of dance and a black tile with a silhouette of a Minifigure expressing themselves rather artistically with yellow and dark pink paint dripping down, some of it covering the Minifigure as if he or she is wearing it like a cape/cloak/poncho. Really tippy design.</p>

<p>DJ Cheetah is a simple minimalistic design without too much busy design cues making him ideal for some fun display options and also great for parting out the torso and legs to other dance club goers. Overall I&#39;d recommend this particular minifigure. Recommended.</p>
