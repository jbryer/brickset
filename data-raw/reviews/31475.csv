"8BrickMario","2021-03-15T14:58:40.17Z","One of Vidiyo's most versatile.","<p>I was intrigued by this theme purely for the opportunity for more wacky and fantastical character designs, which I can never get enough of, and this line offering essentially an additional CMF series on the market satisfied my disappointments with some of the recent offerings in that theme. I have no interest in the app, and will thus only review the physical contents of the product. This was the first minifigure I opened from my first pull of three boxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>This is the most contentious thing about the line and likely a sign of things to come. Vidiyo Bandmates figures are attractively packaged in small, thin cardboard boxes about the size of a CMF packet...but they are 100 percent truly blind-packaged and have no identifiers. The codes and details on the box don&#39;t contain any tells for the figure inside, and thus, buying is a lot riskier and more likely to be wasteful. This is very likely an eco-friendly move, and I applaud that, but the consequence is that it&nbsp;removes the optional aspect of CMF blind-buying and I fear that&#39;s going to apply to all CMFs in the near future now. Putting some kind of tell or code on the box for those dedicated enough to learn them would have been more generous and preserved the choice aspect of buying them completely blind. I&#39;ve heard that Bandmates cases have two sets packed in and that they&#39;re not randomly mixed, so if you can reliably buy from one side of one case,&nbsp;you should be getting different figures. It&#39;s worked well enough from me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Genie Dancer&#39;s parts are nice. Really nice, actually. We get the familiar long ponytail piece in magenta, which is great for magical or civilian figures, a pale lavender female head piece, an attractive teal torso, and a new dark lavender color for the genie tail with its own print.</p>

<p>The BeatBit tiles are also fun. The assortment appears to be semi-random, with each Bandmate having a guaranteed signature tile while the other two can be from a wider assortment. The Genie Dancer&#39;s signature tile seems to be the lime green one with the flowers and words. These tiles would make great posters or album covers, but they interact with the app as well.</p>

<p>The stand is made up of a 1x2 brick with two studs on the front, a 2x6 plate, and a 2x4 plate with a raised section and two studs on the front.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Assembled contents</h3>

<p>Each Bandmate comes with a stand for their BeatBits that they can stand on top of or behind, as there are two row of exposed studs. I don&#39;t much like this style of stand, especially because the two characters with unusual footprints (the Genie Dancer and Banshee Singer) were not given any adapters to center them on their stands. So this figure doesn&#39;t fit great on her stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Genie Dancer herself is a really pretty figure, with a rich mix of magenta, teal and lavender giving her a more twilit kind of palette in contrast to the bright genies we&#39;ve seen before. She definitely evokes the beautiful colors of Middle Eastern and South Asian textiles and artwork, and it&#39;s kind of nice to see a more casual genie. I also appreciate how easy she is to remove from context, as even though her colors align with Vidiyo&#39;s eighties poppy theme, her prints and pieces aren&#39;t modern or overly musical. Her tail has some beautiful magic swirls on it, though it&#39;s disappointing that she doesn&#39;t have a lamp. Her accessory is a tambourine, which uses a 2x2 donut tile with a print. It&#39;s okay, but a new piece would have been better. The budget on Vidiyo Bandmate figures seems slightly lower than a CMF, since the new pieces seem mostly to be head molds and there are no double faces. She&#39;s still a nice figure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>Vidiyo Bandmates&nbsp;are inherently a riskier buy than any of LEGO&#39;s mystery figures to date, and you should expect the rest to follow in its footsteps. However, the figures themselves are nice and careful buying should eventually get you what you want. If you have the patience and the money and like the Genie Dancer, go ahead.</p>

<p>The Genie Dancer uses all the same parts as the CMF Genie Girl, aside from the hair which is a more traditional style instead of the unique version of a long ponytail that was seen on Genie Girl.&nbsp; Her hair is also a brilliant shade of dark pink, her light purple shade Genie tailpiece features sparkly printing on the front to enhance the mist-like quality the piece invokes Her torso includes standard Genie costume cues with a musical bent to them, her necklace includes a music note symbol on the centre of the design. And the back of her vest has a matching note symbol.</p>

<p>She is using a printed donut tile as a tambourine, apparently LEGO chose not to introduce a new musical element for this set despite the fact that this would have been the ideal time for an actual tambourine element to go with the numerous guitar and other instruments. My copy includes a lime green printed tile with various butterflies printed on the design, a yellow printed tile with a LEGO minifigure in a classic running man pose complete with sweat band and a dark pink/maroon tile with a sleeping Minifigure on a moon shaped pillow clutching a pillow in her hands.</p>

<p>Overall a decent enough offering and a nice reuse of parts in decent colour choices. Definitely a must-have from this group of Band Mates. Recommended.</p>
