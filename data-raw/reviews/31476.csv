His parts all feature printing that wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a Modern Country Rodeo event or a Country Music festival, he&#39;s got rhinestones and other elements on his top and his pants with a very interesting looking musical note belt buckle printed on the top of the legs.</p>

<p>His accessory is a microphone, no special guitar with bling printed all over it, even his hat is simply a dark blue without anything to make it stand out as being suited for a Disco. I mean, to me Disco includes mirrored shades, mirrored balls and a lot of other stuff that some might consider psychedelic in certain circles. Discowboy suffers a bit from not going far enough with the mixed up craziness of the other Minifigures in the Theme. He has blue hair, printed on his face, no parts to attach or anything, that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>The three tiles I have with my copy include a lime green tile with lady swinging an umbrella around (a nod to the classic Singin&#39; in the Rain perhaps?), an orange tile with a pink horse bucking his/her rider off, the feet seeming to indicate this is Discowboy, except the Minfigure doesn&#39;t have those light blue boots, which is another knock against him. And last, but certainly not least, a dark maroon tile with a high-step kicking Kaiju (IE Godzilla) dancing through a city. Unless this Kaiju is Kung-Fu Fighting.</p>

<p>Overall Discowboy is a serviceable inclusion in the Band Mate Series 1, but a limited appeal and limited re-use of parts makes buying more than one rather useless unless you want to make a Country Music Festival where everybody wears the same bright blue vest with white sleeves. Mildly Recommended.</p>
