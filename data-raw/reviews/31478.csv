<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Banshee Singer&#39;s parts are pretty great. Most of them are difficult to take out of context, but as a whole, she fits any context just fine. It&#39;s always nice to see the Bellatrix hair again, and even though she&#39;s only the second non-Bellatrix character to use it, two is already more than I expected. Her black shoulder piece is nice to have, and she comes with a silver-topped microphone plus a spare. Her ectoplasm tail may be useful. The BeatBit tile she&#39;s guaranteed to have is the one that shows a sheet ghost through a night-vision VHS filter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I feel that the Banshee Singer is one of the most thematically clever figures in the line. For one, her style of music is directly linked to the fact that her species, banshees, are known for their loud wails and screams. But what&#39;s really clever to me is the character design, which recognizes and exploits the parallels between classic-ghost and modern-punk iconography. The wild hair and chains are spooky but also feel performatively edgy, and the look is perfectly suited for a singer despite none of her clothing being explicitly modern or music-themed. If you take the mic out of her hand, she&#39;s pretty much a classic haunted-house ghost and I think that&#39;s brilliant design. The Bellatrix hair is great for a ghost and I don&#39;t mind that it&#39;s black again, and her face straddles the line between sassy performer and boogity-boo spirit. Her torso shows a Victorian-esque corset crossed with chains that have monster faces, and it&#39;s a lot of fun. The shoulder piece is the only thing that pushes it toward modern, but it&#39;s also the only thing that was needed to do so. I love how well the design works in and out of context, especially because I love both readings of the character. The black-and-green dark colors are very attractive as well, and it&#39;s interesting that all three LEGO ghosts falling under or named for the banshee monster are green-toned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One bad thing about this package is that, like the Genie Dancer, the Banshee Singer&#39;s footprint doesn&#39;t work with the stand for a centered display. But that&#39;s seriously my only complaint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>

<p>This minifigure is a high point of Vidiyo&#39;s designs, neatly working as a musician from recent decades as well as a classic ghost, and is just&nbsp;an appealing figure regardless of context. Maybe it&#39;s my monster bias talking, but this is the queen of Bandmates Series 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lego Vidiyo bandmates series 1, Banshee singer was not my first hope for the figure I got in my solitary random box , but I must say I am pleasantly surprised, along with the added sentimentality of this being ( including duplicates ) my 300th Lego set to date .</p>

<p>The figure -</p>

<p>The figure uses the Bellatrix Lestrange hair piece in its original colour, a spring green head with a somewhat evil smile printed, a Ninjago armour piece in black, a sand green chain-covered torso and some dual moulded dark green and trans green ghost legs.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory is just the black microphone piece with silver printing . The stand is built on two black snot pieces with a 2&times;6 black plate in front with three &#39;beatbits&#39; attached (2&times;2 tiles) I got the one exclusive to this figure being a black one with a ghost printed , and orange one with a vortex on it and a teele one with a microphone .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a surprisingly decent figure from a ( in my opinion ) lacklustre series and an overpriced theme , however my main issue comes with the packaging as it is a box , not the usual pack , luckily it seems that only Vidiyo will use this method , but it still completely destroyed the concept of chance and the ability to get what you want , however if you somehow have the ability to find out which one is which I would recommend this figure , especially to a person with an interest in this theme and series and is in possession of some x-ray goggles .</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-03-04T20:10:23.84Z","A Wailing Good Time.","<p><b>Set #43101 Banshee Singer:</b>&nbsp;LEGO is really getting some mileage out of the ghostly lower torso elements, it&#39;s nice to see them return yet again. This time for an appropriately spooky and perfectly suitable addition to any Hidden Side collection.</p>

<p>Banshee Singer has a lower torso with no printing, which makes sense, it&#39;s a ghostly tail in solid dark green with hints of transparency, her upper torso is wonderfully enchanting and full of suitably appropriate nods, she&#39;s wearing a green outfit which is laced up like a bodice or something suitable for Victorian style dresses, but is also covered in chains with little ghostly or skull-headed locks and a pair of keys to unlock said locks on her back. She includes a familiar shoulder armour paldron which I believe either originated in Ninjago or with LEGO Nexo Knights. Her hair is a similar sculpt which, if memory serves, I first saw on a character from the Rock Villains in Nexo Knights, this time in black. She includes a microphone accessory and a printed facial expression with an open-mouthed tongue sticking out nod to the band Kiss.</p>

<p>The trio of printed tiles I find accompanying my lone copy of this character includes a black tile with a LEGO ghost in one corner and what appears to be a haunted house&#39;s front door in the other, a light aqua tile with a large megaphone with siren on it and an orange tile with a singer falling through a trapdoor while shouting ahhhhhhh! Really fun designs all around.</p>

<p>Banshee Singer is a brilliant addition from the Band Mates and makes for a suitably frightening and fun design. Highly Recommended.</p>
