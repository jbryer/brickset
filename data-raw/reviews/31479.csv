"8BrickMario","2021-03-15T15:30:28.55Z","Far, far out.","<p>This was the third figure I got from my first pull of three boxes, and the first I got from my second pull of four boxes. Not a bad one to get twice, though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>Blind boxes stink.Try to buy from one half of one case to increase your odds of unique figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Alien Keytarist&#39;s parts really aren&#39;t that useful for other things, save the keytar, which is new in teal and now has the keys printed in the correct direction. The BeatBit tile you&#39;re guaranteed to get with this one is the orange one with the design of a minfigure getting struck (maybe vaporized) by a sci-fi beam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>This one&#39;s a really fun take on aliens, with a highly cartoony humanoid style that reminds me of things like&nbsp;<em>Futurama</em>. It&#39;s not like anything we&#39;ve seen from LEGO before. I can&#39;t find any info on the gender of this character, but given their lack of overtly feminine features, I&#39;ll assume they&#39;re male. It&#39;s still a rather gender-neutral design, however, and I kind of like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His hair is a new rubber piece depicting a shaggy short sideswept style with an undercut and two cartoon antennae poking out. His skin is orange, which continues across the minifigure. His head depicts a large light yellow eye with a standard minifigure pupil and a raised eyebrow above the eye, and he&#39;s giving an excited grin. His face and legs have subtle lavender spots on them, but they ought to have printed the arms with them as well. His torso is printed with a black tank top patterned with teal and spring green UFO-style ring and circle patterns and he&#39;s wearing a flying saucer pendant. His legs have purple shorts and boots, with the shorts having athletic-style stripes and an unusual texture on the hip. The legs aren&#39;t dual-molded due to the design they went with. The keytar is new in teal and the keys are fixed from the previous usage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>This is a really fun civilian alien, which is a take we&#39;ve rarely, if ever, seen from LEGO and the cartoony aesthetic is its own layer of charm. I don&#39;t expect this will be my last repeat figure, but it&#39;s a nice one to have a spare of.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-03-04T20:20:45.403Z","Rockstar from Outer Space!","<p><b>Set #43101 Alien Keytarist:</b>&nbsp;Welcome the cute and adorable looking orange keytarist, with a single eye and purple spots on his orange skinned face this Band Mate originates from way outside the Milky Way. He&#39;s got a purple hair head piece complete with alien antenna, a spacey looking keytar element in aqua or teal, not entirely sure and a cosmic looking outfit with a little UFO necklace and some spacey designs on his torso print. His legs appear to feature shorts with sneakers.</p>

<p>For the trio of Tiles I have, I got the glowing Minifigure who looks like he&#39;s being zapped by a space ray on a light orange tile, a black tile with a clock falling through the atmosphere and burning up on re-entry and a lime green tile with a flying cow on it indicating alien abduction of the poor cow.</p>

<p>Overall this thrilling Band Mate wouldn&#39;t look out of place in any Space based displays, you could have him throwing a rock concern for your Classic Space Men or Blacktron or any others you&#39;d care to name. Highly Recommended.</p>
