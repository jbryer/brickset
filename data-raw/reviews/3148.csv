"Monty","2007-03-15T08:54:23.263Z","Does what it says on the tin.","As people seem to have reviewed this I thought why not add my views. This is a very useful tool for separating bricks that are stuck fast - sometimes having two - one on each part is necessary. It strikes me it would have been very useful to have when I was younger as much of my surviving childhood Lego bears many teeth marks which is how I recall we used to separate bricks in the old days - especially when the tiles did not have a little groove around the bottom – not that this would help you there as it needs studs or holes to lock into. Anyway, it does what is says it does – separates bricks! As those of you are observant will see i have three reviews for the price of one as the colours do not make much difference to how it functions, but i prefer the green one as it is easier to spot in my crates of spares where i have lots of grey elements.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-06-13T14:54:13.45Z","To separate bricks, use it","This set (separator brick) is just a brick, as the price (1,69 dollars) shows. This is really useful, altough cannot increase very well any set. But this is useful just because it separate any brick easily, and is good to use.

This brick don't separate the hardest bricks or plates (this brick can also separate plates, but not these hard), that seems to be separated only with the teeth, but works easily and correct with any other bricks or plates. To separate a brick or plate with it, you just have to fit the brick on it's part under the front, and press it backward. The brick will be separated from the building easily. This brick also features in another version the old gray color scheme, that is most common among some old sets. But the green color is also very cool, and the compatibility of the color schemes don't make it good or bad, is the capacibility to separate bricks easily that makes it.

This &quot;set&quot; (it is just a brick) is sold commonly by US$ 1.69. Good for who want, but some of the old (can be also called classics) buckets of pieces (like the buckets from the early 1990's years), included one or more of these bricks, so, pay for it isn't good, altough it is quite useful.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Then one day while you're building something, you have a little trouble pulling them apart. What can you do about it? Oh you just had your nails clipped. You accidentally swallowed one last time and you fear it will happen again. Where's that toolbox? It was in this cabinet last time, but now it's gone because your mom put it somewhere else and she has no idea. 

Oh woe is you! Or is it?! Behold the ultimate tool!

Something stuck on the bottom? Put the bottom piece on the top end of the tool and pull the piece back. VOILA! It's free! Can't get that piece off the base because it's wedged between all those other pegs and the piece is so thin? ""Scrape"" it out with the bottom end. 'Tis a miracle! What? Still don't have it eh? Your local Lego Store or Retailer has a whole bunch, for a price you won't believe nor regret.

I just reemerged from my Dark Age in 2006 after visiting the LEGO Store while on a trip to Disney World. My first reaction to seeing this part was that it wasn't a LEGO brick. I looked closer and saw the LEGO font on the studs and stared at and studied this and couldn't for the life of me figure out what it was. When I looked through the LEGO magazines that were included in the LEGO yard sale I was shocked to learn that this was a brick separator. I went right to my plates and separated them with this fantastic tool! If I had this as a kid my LEGO plates wouldn't have had so many teeth marks on them! Now if the people who I bought LEGO from at Yard Sales this summer used this separator instead of their teeth I wouldn't have had to throw away so many chewed LEGO plates!

If you do a lot of building, then get a couple of these to help you break down old models quickly & easily. No more broken finger nails or teeth marks in your LEGO !

It takes a little bit of practice to get the best out of them, but once you've mastered the technique getting two 1x2 plates apart will take you just a second or two, with no damage to you or the bricks !

So I have one, and it is REALLY useful.  I like building solid structures, and when its time to take them apart, my fingernails hurt!  But with this, you just pop the brick out (that's called a ""lever"" kids)!  There is not much else I can say, so I'll just say one last thing.  This is great!

"Formentar","2010-07-21T06:34:11.89Z","Indispensable","As many other reviewers have noted, the brick separator is an indispensable tool. Oh, if I had only had one when I was a kid - it would have saved a great many pieces from bite marks. Anyway, when I ordered this I already had two of the dark grey separators that came with Mindstorms (RIS), but I figured it would be good to have another one in a colour that stands out a bit more. No disappointment there - the green is much easier to spot than the dark grey, so I figure I will not have to spend quite so much time trying to locate it among other pieces on my table. However, I would've rated the grey ones higher than the 4 I'm giving this green one, and the reason is that it just doesn't fit as well. If I try to remove, say, a 1x2 plate on a larger plate, the brick separator gets caught on the studs on the larger plate. That is, the edge that's supposed to go between the 1x2 plate and the studs is just slightly thicker than the available space, and in some cases it just won't fit. I'm sure it will work fine once I've filed off a hair's breadth or so, but it's annoying that the tolerances are such that it's needed.<br>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,5
