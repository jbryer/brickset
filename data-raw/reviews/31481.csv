<p>Her torso and legs are printed with what is clearly 80s inspired dance club or rock scene attire, she features a colourful lightning bolt on the front and a small musical note on the back in the pattern of spots on her top, peeking out is a striped undershirt and her pants are a hot dark pink with sequins.</p>

<p>For an accessory she includes the boom box, this time it is done in a fetching aquamarine colour with gold highlights and looks much less bland compared to the Red Panda Dancer accessory. She includes three Beatbits (as they are called in this line), with the copy I am reviewing I have the same musical print similar to Space Invaders, a yellow tile with a bowing or headbanging minifigure grooving to the music and a lime green tile with a sparkly looking Minifigure heard creating a rainbow roadway from his mouth.</p>

<p>Overall a cute and impressive Minifigure from Vidyo and I am thrilled to have found so many of them, I&#39;d definitely recommend tracking one or two down as they would look great in any display. Recommended.</p>
