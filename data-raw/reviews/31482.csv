The design of the figure is highly reminiscent of Monster Fighters, though in this case I believe the Werewolf head sculpt is a brand-new element as it does not feature a Minifigure head underneath for transformation. This is a fully realised Werewolf, with furry paws for feet and ripped clothing showing off a furry belly underneath. The tail is a re-use of a Legends of Chima element.</p>

<p>The print on the torso is very impressive, he has torn blue jeans on the leg, a dark black jacket on the front with his logo on the back (hidden whenever the head is attached, but still there) and a few nice touches on the torso including a skull necklace and a musical note printed on his jacket. Indeed most of the Minifigures in this Theme have featured a musical note somewhere on their torso with rare few exceptions. He comes with two bones, but they are not bones, these are his drumsticks, it would have been nice if he had a drum kit to play them with, but I suppose you&#39;ll have to MOC your own.</p>

<p>The trio of Beatbits AKA printed tiles I have with my version includes a lime green print with the logo of the Werewolf Drummer and possibly his band on the front, it shows a holing wolf with his claws out standing in a circular silhouette that is actually a clever looking print of a crystal ball hinting at the full moon transformation common in werewolf myth. An aquamarine tile with a skull sticking its tongue out that is even more of a nod to the band Kiss since it includes some markings printed on the skull&#39;s face that resembles the Make Up worn by that famous band. And an orange tile with what appears to be a tomato splattering against a wall considering its leaking red juice everywhere.</p>

<p>Overall truly a strong performance for this Band Mate and a welcome addition to the collection. Highly Recommended.</p>
