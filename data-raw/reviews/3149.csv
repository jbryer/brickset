"shenron","2007-12-28T08:13:56.75Z","A no-brainer array of figures","In this one of the many small minifigures boxes released over time, there are 6 little people each of which with his own accessory.

The selection is nothing special, actually so obvious that it added only a little to an existing town. There were lots of policeman, doctors, firemen, workers and postmen in town sets of those years.

The exception is probably the bike. If you have a white bicycle in your Legoland diorama, you must have owned this little figures set, as a bike of such color has likely not been available everywhere else.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"pheared","2008-01-27T20:08:20.467Z","Supporting Cast for a Classic Town","The selection of minifigs in this set is appropriate for the classic 1980's Town theme. You have your doctor, fire fighter, police officer, etc., yes -- a nice touch is the mail carrier complete with letter. I'd often wondered why Lego didn't offer a series of post offices to go with its never ending littany of police stations and fire houses. One would have been nice! The presence of the extremely rare white bicycle (it's only available in this set) rounds off 6301's positive features.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The career choices are reasonably broad yet obvious and as usual everyone is happy -no hairy, mean or grouchy faces as with later realism. The simplicity of the original MF face, past the old blank one, is that everyone is the same.

The white bike's rubber tyres and clear plastic disc spoke-wheels are excellent and the flimsy bikes were a clever design that usually came with a light like this clear one. The mechanic which, like the other MFs, may not seem much different from other sets is possibly a more rounded character.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Where the other folk might diminish in appeal may be the lack of a cb radio and light on the policeman's baton, no cap, parcel or sack representation for the postman, no oxygen tank or axe for the fireman and no extra bricks or pieces for the doctor and bike rider to use as bandage or shopping. A brick driven imaginary object is better than nothing but the townspeople remain straight forward accessories and succeed as useful and iconic population. We are now spoilt with collectible MFs and hand held objects that were not possible back then so these fit perfectly with 1980's models.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigure Reproduction</b></div><div>There is no reason why they would not work mixed in to modern sets too and with a low piece count, this set may be easy to recreate, if not as complete in box.</div></div>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3
"T79","2020-05-07T22:27:15.73Z","unexpected favourite","<p>I don&#39;t think I ever imagined I&#39;d be writing a review of this set, seeing as I never owned it. Never owned it until quite recently, when I found a boxed copy in a second-hand shop for &euro;1.50, at a price like that I just buy whatever I find so now I <em>do</em> own it. Even then, writing a review was not something on my mind but as it turns out, ever since she chanced upon this box my three-year-old daughter has been playing with it every day so maybe it&#39;s time to rethink that review...</p>

<p>First a small quirk: the set number #6301. I remember my first minifigure pack, #6302, released in 1982. Why then this set, released in 1986 has number #6301, who knows?</p>

<p>I hoped the back of the box would show some alternative configurations, rather it just shows a picture of all the included parts. Bummer!</p>

<p>In the finest minifigure pack tradition, there are six minifigs included.</p>

<p>1) a female doctor with briefcase, presumably with her instruments apart from the (printed) stethoscope around her neck. This one is my daughter&#39;s favourite by a mile and then some, the only addition she&#39;s done is to give her a green injection needle from one of her brother&#39;s Jurassic World sets. If only they had had those back in 1986...</p>

<p>2) a female in striped shirt (so eighties it hurts) on a white bicycle, this one&#39;s for dad to ride around (or rather, to have an accident so my daughter can come and patch her up using the doctor). Always nice to have another bike (and in another colour too, this is our only bike in white), and it could serve equally well for the police officer as for the mailman too.</p>

<p>3) speaking of which, the mailman is number three on her list, carrying a letter that&#39;s hardly rare but employees of the postal services rather are, we had just one that came with #6651 so another one never hurts.</p>

<p>4) a mechanic, in blue dungarees and a blue cap is not rare at all, the same minifigure comes in about a dozen sets and that&#39;s not even counting variations in headgear. He has a wrench that&#39;s mainly used to fix the bike after another accident.</p>

<p>5) a police officer in your standard eighties uniform but with a red signal paddle which is the only one we have in that colour.</p>

<p>6) a firefighter, also in your standard eighties uniform, with a grey extinguisher which has to be of limited use in a real fire but adding a fire lorry with hose would have been a bit too much, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>The last two of these clearly see less use in my daughter&#39;s stories, she&#39;s just focused on healing and fixing so no criminals for the officer to catch and no burning bike to extinguish, although if I had got this in 1986 I&#39;d have been ecstatic to add one of each as both police force and fire department were severely understaffed in our collection.</p>

<p>Nothing to fault here, it can be used to expand on your town population but as my daughter is quite fond of showing it can be used on its own too, so I think these minifigures were chosen really well. In fact, I think they work better together to create interesting stories on their own than those from my minifigure pack #6302. Now, back to riding a bike over some of those crater plates, it&#39;s perfectly safe I assure you... and if not, at least there&#39;s a doctor on hand. :-)</p>
