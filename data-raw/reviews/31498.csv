<p>The Emperor (aka Sheev Palpatine/Darth Sidious) is star wars&#39; biggest villain (not most iconic , but biggest) and Lego have notoriously done him justice in figure form, but let&#39;s see how he holds up using the newer style hood piece released on triple force Friday 2019 in the latest issue of the Lego star wars magazine .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure isn&#39;t exclusive as everything included came in the 75291 Death Star final duel , he has the newer hood piece included in black (previously only coming in 3&nbsp;sets) , the usual modern Palpatine head in light tan with a content and an angry face with both having the deep scaring he received in ep 3 and his yellow Sith eyes , a softer style black cape and his Sith robe detailing from his torso to his legs .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His singular included accessory is one of his lightsabers with the trans red blade and pearl gold hilt , however the content of the magazine indicates that this is an ep 6 based set and he loses both of his lightsabers in ep 3 but oh well it&#39;s nice to get it anyway despite lightning having been more accurate .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a decent figure , but I am not crazy for the newer hood , as it looks too tall to me and I think that at least one lightning piece should have been included as well to more appropriately depict his ep 6 form but overall I recommend it to current non Palpatine figure owners .</p>
