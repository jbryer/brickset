"legoguy2805","2008-05-17T11:14:02Z","Servant of Teridax!","I got this off Ebay for &#163;3 in 2007. In the storyline, Fikou can spin very strong webs and they also have poisionous bites. For some time, Teridax controlled the Fikou, along with other Rahi, with Infected Masks. (That's why it's got a mask on its back.) Anyway, the review:

Pros:
Good colour scheme
Infected (Orange) Kanohi Pakari, Mask of Strength
Claws
Stands up very well

Cons:
Mask falls off easily
Head falls off easily

Overall, 4/5 because it gets annoying when the head falls off all the time.

And it&#39;s neat how &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they used a bionicle&nbsp;mask for the egg sack. The&nbsp;legs are made from bionicle claws. The&nbsp;instructions are great. And the polybag/packaging&nbsp;was o.k. I&nbsp;am also a spider fan.</p>
