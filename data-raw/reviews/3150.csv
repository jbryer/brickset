I remember giving them all names, and thinking that woman with the mug was a man with long hair (to this day I've still no idea why I thought that).  A very useful collection of people to help populate any lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Niki124","2023-02-19T19:48:51.077Z","Very nice ensemble","<p>This was a good variety of figures to add to our Legoland City lineup. Each appears to have their own background or story, though we could never quite figure out who the redheaded lady was - the Lady Mayoress sweeping up after the Mayor, or a cleaning lady with a big line in jewellery? Everyone else appeared to have a role as the postmaster, a street cook, a roadworks engineer, a bossy man with a loudhailer, or someone who drank coffee for a living. They could always help out at our Snack Bar or Post Office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There would be some scope to change the outfits (ie the leg parts) round, but it&#39;s not something we considered at the time. But this set was ideal to pad out our Legoland scenes and provide a few customers to our growing collection of stores.&nbsp;</p>
