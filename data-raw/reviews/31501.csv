Do I need to say more? Well, yes, because otherwise, it wouldn&#39;t be a proper review, would it? Anyway, let&#39;s get started.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>Zane is packaged in&nbsp;the now standard foil pack introduced last year. On the front there is a cool action shot of Zane aiming his crossbow at someone. There is nothing interesting on the back.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>While the assembly of the minifigure is fairly simple, there is a small bit of complexity in the shield and crossbow, which I appreciate. The instructions included in the magazine are easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The pieces included are pretty normal for a foil pack like this. This is, however, the cheapest way to get a golden S13 armour piece and, get ready for it - Zane&#39;s SILVER MOVIE HAIR. If you want to display the titanium ninja unmasked without him looking bald, this is the best way to do so&nbsp;without breaking your piggy bank or buying a crappy small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get two 1x1 transparent light blue round tiles with glitter embedded in them. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re rare or not, but it&#39;s the first time that I&#39;ve gotten them.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure included in this magazine gift is Zane in his Hero armour from Master of the Mountain. I&#39;ve heard a lot of complaints from the community about this version of the ninja of ice, but personally, I really like it. The golder armour really reminds me of his ZX suit, and I am a fan of his azure belt, which helps to make his gi less monochrome. He still has the same face print, which he&#39;s been using since 2018, but for some reason, mine copy&#39;s mouth is a bit offset to the right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides the look of the figure, the only other con that I could see some people pointing out is the lack of Zane&#39;s hood piece. Even though it is unfortunate,&nbsp;a lot of people, who don&#39;t have a lot of money to spend on Lego, can now get their hands on Zane&#39;s silver hairpiece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hero Zane comes with a cool&nbsp;icy shield and a stud shooting crossbow, which I&#39;ll cover in the playability section.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The play value here is a bit better compared to some of the other magazine foil packs, because this one includes a working shooting crossbow! If you load one of those nice glitter tiles into the crossbow and push the brown lever, Zane can defeat the Skull Sorcerer&#39;s forces with ease! While older fans like may not care for it, younger people will have lots of fun with this feature.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In the end, should you buy this magazine gift? Absolutely! While some may not like the design of Hero Zane, this is an excellent value for what you get, even with the recent price increase of the Ninjago magazines. This is also by far the cheapest way to get Zane&rsquo;s titanium post-movie hair. If you still haven&rsquo;t picked this up already&nbsp;and you have a couple of bucks to spare, what are you waiting for?</p>
