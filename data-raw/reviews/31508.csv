<p>This is the Octan Coin released March 1st for 1150 VIP points (equivalent to &pound;7.18 in VIP points). This is the thrid coin to be released, after the Castle and Pirates ones in Feb. These little coins sold out quickly and now go for a pretty penny but are they worth it? Let&#39;s have a look.</p>

<p><strong>Coin</strong></p>

<p>The most important thing the coin. The&nbsp;metal coin is surprisingly covered in a silver metallic paint, sadly mine has a chip in the paint on the back. Starting with the back of the coin the edges are raised slightly to the rest of the coin and pressed in the coin is a LEGO VIP logo. Not much else on the back and sadly the sides of the coin do not have a pattern or any markings.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of these coins are the front of them, this is the LEGO Octan coin so obviously there is the iconic LEGO City Octan logo, which is made using a red and green glass material, unfortunately&nbsp;these might not always be perfectly lined and there have been a few instances of these colours going over the lines, thankfully my coin does not have this problem. Around the Octan logo is a black and white race flag&nbsp;pattern.</p>

<p>A thing I noticed with my coin is it had a few scratches on even before I opened the case it is in. The coin does weigh&nbsp;a bit being metal but not too much.</p>

<p><strong>Case</strong></p>

<p>Now when the first coin was available there was 5 coin case, that has sadly long gone, but each coin comes with a small case to place the one coin in, they are all the same. These acrylic cases have three pieces of clear acrylic. The top piece of acrylic has a LEGO VIP logo printed on in a blue rectangle. Then the middle piece has a round hole to place the coin and finally the back piece has nothing exciting to it. The sheets of acrylic are held together with four small screws that go through one of four holes in each sheet.</p>

<p>Some problems I&#39;ve found with the case is that firstly&nbsp;it scratches extremely easily, even before opening it my case had a lot of scratches, some fairly deep. Secondly, the screws are a bit of a pain to put together if you have dismantled&nbsp;the case. When delivered the cases are wrapped in a sheet of tissue paper but sadly this doesn&#39;t do much to stop scratching, and I have heard of some people getting theirs with the tissue paper ripped in transit.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>So these coins are a great concept, but in my eyes they have been quite poorly executed with a lot of blemishes in the coin and cases. The 1150 VIP point price isn&#39;t too bad I guess but the damage that these coins and cases have before even being delivered is kind of disappointing, but it does appear that these coins are still collectable despite their downfalls with this coin in particular selling out within a few hours and going for onwards of &pound;40 on eBay as of writing.</p>

<p>One thing that bugs me is that the coins are painted, don&#39;t understand why they were not made out of aluminium or another relatively priced shinny metal. I&#39;m not sure on the metal inside, so it could be aluminium.</p>

<p>I do I recommend these coins, no not really unless you like collecting weird and obscure LEGO items, which these definitely are. As an investment these are good as there is a demand for them but if you&#39;re just an average collector then these are worth a miss.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Nice collectable pieces, exclusivity</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Damage on arrival, coin being painted</p>
