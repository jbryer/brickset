So if you don't need many small trees, buy this set. Apart from the small trees, the set's contents is the same as set 6317's: two big deciduous trees and two big fir trees including some flowers. You can use the flowers as grass if you remove the blossoms. You can't do without any plants when you have a city layout. Everything looks much nicer with some trees. You can also use them for your castle theme, of course. You can create some woods where Robin Hood can hide. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The only problem is that they are really few. It is quite rare to need just this small amount, and this box should have rather been twice its size.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Those sets lego published were so necessary to give your city/ castle/ train station a nicer look. I must admit, i go for those trees, flowers, palms really a lot, there are never enough of them. So thanks to lego who made it possible to build a nice, friendly city with some green stains",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

These saplings have been clipped buy a prize winning&nbsp;gardener. Some greenery enters the Town theme with the inclusion here of some foliage; trees and flowers.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>How Does Your Garden Grow?</b></div>

<div>The classic trees and flowers have always been great for adding a bit of colour and filling in a representation of woods and wilderness but personally I found they never quite cut it other than ornamental garden growth.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Green Fingers?</b></div>

<div>The build is well, take a tree and press it on to studs and the tree is complete, oh well lets try the flowers. These are better and come in a few colours- is there a rare flower colour such as black? I doubt it but in this set what you see is what you get.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>These remain &#39;filler&#39; brick pieces much like one piece boat hulls. Wilderness and forest is something rarely properly addressed in Lego sets but these classic bricks&nbsp;absolutely work and look great in a wider surrounding but of course mini-figs struggle to get between them as they have no canopy or height! The chunksters knock down these bushes at any opportune trip in to woodland.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Seasonal Change</b></div>

<div>For proper building try seeing what greys and browns can do for tree and bush trunks and experiment a simple tree build- it can not look any less representative! Try also Autumn leaves and winter bare branches.</div>

Setting up the flowers was quite fiddly (the coloured flowers had to be separated from a frame, as with the parts in model ships or aeroplanes) and their tiny size means this set was not recommended for small children. But as with real flowers, a few clusters here and there brightened the place up. The only downside was the tendency of the trees to clump together in storage.&nbsp;</p>
