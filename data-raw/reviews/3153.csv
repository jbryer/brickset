"shenron","2007-12-28T08:36:04.747Z","Very much needed in a town","In its own way, this is quite an essential set to build a decently sized town. But for some reasons, it was reissued only once, and I haven't seen a road sign accessory box for nearly 20 years.

All of the signs are printed (no stickers) are most are not available in other sets. 

With 12 signs (two of which in two copies), the size of this box is well chosen, considering that most young Legoland fans don't probably have more than a dozen roadplates, and 1-2 signs per roadplate is a good average.

There certainly could be many more signs than those included, and a notable miss here is the men-at-work sign, which in my opinion could have had a more common use than the &quot;no-turn-left&quot; sign.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-08-29T07:37:59.607Z","Accident Prevention","These road signs were great.

"Eric_Botswana","2014-06-24T13:00:25.613Z","Sign of the times","<p>A supplementary set, sure, but a good one that really spruced up your roads. They were more for decoration than anything, I don&#39;t recall any of my Lego drivers paying any attention to them.</p>

<p>The downside for me though was I was an Australian child and several of these signs just aren&#39;t used in Australia. I had no idea what the blue one with the red diagonal line was supposed to mean. Smurfs not allowed?</p>

<p>Also many of these signs didn&#39;t last and were broken in the box.</p>

<p>Overall, a must to make your Lego town look more towny. Just don&#39;t expect drivers to obey them.</p>

So, to have this set in our Lego collection was an achievement, even though we only had two road baseplates and both of those had buildings across them. I would have liked a greater variety of signs at the time, but nevertheless this was a welcome supplementary set.&nbsp;</p>
