"shenron","2007-12-28T08:45:45.81Z","Average selection","During the 80s, small boxes of 6 minifigures were quite common, and there was usually one per Legoland theme (town, space, castle) in a year catalogue, updated to suit the clothing/hair/accessory styles of the time.

This box had a quite average selection, adding a policeman, a fireman, a female doctor, a mechanic, a female civilian, and an airport worker, the latter one being the only odd selection considering that the '85 airport was an expensive set at the time.

The greatest value in this little box is probably the police motorbike, the windshield of which is very hard to find.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-02T13:48:11.45Z","Town Mini-Figures Review","<p>Now days, sets like this are called Minifigure Collections or Battle Packs. Back in the 80's when these type of sets would come out, it would just be an assortment of Minifigures for the theme in question, in this case it's Town and not very many pieces to build with, just their accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that was fine, even great, it's how you got more minifigures to populate a Lego City with. 6 Minifigures are included. A police man on motorcycle, fireman, doctor, air port worker, mechanic and civilian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now days, we see close to the same sets in Collections and Battle Packs, but with Collections, there tends to be more of a minibuild involved and 2 fewer minifigures then what these offered.</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,4,5

<p>Pretty nonexistent, save for the motorcycle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Speaking of...that motorcycle!&nbsp; Those hand-held marker lights!&nbsp; That doctor&#39;s bag!&nbsp; There are some outstanding pieces in this set, especially if you were just starting your Town collection!&nbsp; And the graphics are just top-notch, in a wholly retro and LEGO way.&nbsp; That shirt the the ground controller is wearing is still one of my favorite LEGO pieces of all time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>Off the charts!&nbsp; This is an entire town you can fit in the palm of your hand!&nbsp; Each of these Minifigs played several pivotal roles in my burgeoning town when I was a young LEGO &quot;mayor.&quot;&nbsp; This set is a must-have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
