"HeadFax","2021-09-01T18:53:46.473Z","A solid set for older Batman fans","<p>Batman has always been my favorite superhero. I&#39;ve read the comics, I adored the 90s animated series, I&#39;ve seen all the films, I&#39;ve even picked up the odd novel. But nothing takes me back to my childhood more than the original 1966 television series. I used to watch syndicated reruns every afternoon at my grandmother&#39;s house. I convinced my parents to get me the Official Batman Batbook. I knew the show backwards and forwards. Until Tim Burton&#39;s vision of the hero hit the mainstream in the late 80s, the garish, campy televised version of Batman was the only version of Batman that mattered.</p>

<p>Naturally, I had to buy the re-designed 1966 Batmobile. I missed&nbsp;out on the 1966 Batcave set from 2016, and I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;s much more material from that era that&#39;s left to re-create (unless we get life-sized busts of Adam West and Burt Ward, which I wouldn&#39;t object to).</p>

<p>But enough about me, the Bat-Nerd. Let&#39;s get into the set.</p>

<p>I bought this set as a display model, and it certainly fits that bill. The first thing you construct is the (surprisingly functional) rotating base, which serves well to display the Batmobile&nbsp;in all its quirky glory. The connection between the car and the base is solid, yet it&#39;s easy to remove and replace the vehicle. A large plaque provides critical specifications about the Batmobile by way of an oversized sticker. The detail plaque doesn&#39;t have the most secure connection to the rotating base, but that&#39;s hardly a major concern.</p>

<p>The set comes bundled with two minifigs. The Batman minifig is absolutely spot-on, although I would have appreciated batarangs in dark blue, which would have&nbsp;better mimicked the source material. The Joker is a fitting homage to Cesar Romero&#39;s take on the iconic villain. The costume, hair, and makeup are perfect, right down to the faint trace of a moustache (Cesar Romero famously refused to shave his during the show&#39;s filming). This is my favorite detail from this set.</p>

<p>But now we get to my first real complaint. The 1966 series was as much about Robin as it was about Batman, and Robin is unfortunately absent from this set. Thanks to the show&#39;s rotating rogue&#39;s gallery, The Joker only appeared in 19 of the show&#39;s 120 episodes (almost the most of any villain, second only to The Penguin), whereas Robin was in ALL of them! I understand the reasoning behind including&nbsp;one of the 1966 series&#39; more recognizable villains, and I applaud the decision to use The Joker, but seeing Batman alone in the 1966 Batmobile just seems wrong to me. This problem is compounded by the fact that the 1966 Robin minifig is relatively rare, as it only appeared in the 1966 Batcave set, and so finding one on the secondary market is a costly proposition. Honestly, failing to include a third minifig in the Batmobile re-design was a huge miss.</p>

<p>The Batmobile itself was a fun build, if a little on the short side. The set only has 345 pieces, and while that&#39;s more than enough to build a robust vehicle, I would have appreciated something slightly larger and with a little more complexity. But don&#39;t let my opinion deter you: this Batmobile is designed and executed very well, so that it more than adequately represents the source material. It has curves and angles in all of the right places (within reason, of course), and while there may be a few variations in the &quot;paint job&quot;, I can find very little fault with how the set was put together. I was appreciative of the fact that the stud-launchers were designed to be removed. The Batmobile might have had rocket launchers, but it looks considerably sleeker without them visible. It does take a little bit of work to take them off (removing and replacing some paneling and support pieces), but I genuinely feel that the stud-launchers add worthwhile playability, and so I am not complaining about their inclusion.</p>

<p>The Lincoln Futura concept car that the Batmobile was based on is probably one of the strangest-looking cars you&#39;ll ever set eyes on, and it would take a larger-scale build with quite a bit more detail to really capture some of its intricacies. Nevertheless, this set gets really close to the Batmobile&#39;s original design, and very clearly gets the point across. One detail that I absolutely must call out is the fact that the car&#39;s trunk is spacious enough to hold the stud-launchers and ammunition, which means there won&#39;t be any loose pieces floating around when you re-configure the car.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the 1966 Batmobile set is a success. It&#39;s an inexpensive set, and it has enough detail and playability to be collectable and fun to play with. Most importantly to me, however, is the fact that it is simply chock-full of nostalgia. For that, I may be able to forgive the absence of The Boy Wonder.</p>

I grew up watching the classic 60s Batman television show, so this set was a must-buy for me. At $30, it is the (nearly) perfect model for a superhero set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures are both spectacular. Batman has the right prints, but it would be best if he had dual moulding legs. His facial expression is a nice change from the normal scowl.</p>

<p>Joker is great, but he too could benefit from having side leg printing. His suit matches the on-screen version, and a small moustache is also visible on his face. Just a good figure overall.</p>

<p>The elephant in the room, or more or less in the set, is the lack of a Robin figure. The Batmobile contains a seat for him, but his absence leaves an odd hole the set cannot fill. Had Robin been included, the set would have 5 stars from me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of the Batmobile is challenging, but also fun. Interesting angle techniques make up the back fins. The inclusion of the stud shooters adds play for children; luckily, the designers included a way to take them off for adult collectors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the set is a great display piece, and a fun, casual, build to do while maybe watching the classic television show!</p>

"Duq","2022-07-19T23:25:16.813Z","Great display piece!","<p>I&#39;m not a Batman fan but even to me this is an iconic car. The previous set it came in had a bonus bat cave and was a little expensive so I was happy it got a release on its own. It&#39;s a set that doubles as playset and display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>This set comes with two minifigs, and obviously that&#39;s Batman and Robin. Right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wrong. For some reason there&#39;s no Robin but instead we get a joker. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s a great minifig. His suit has a nice print and his face resembles 1966 joker. I get that for the set to work as a playset Batman needs to have someone or something to shoot at, but for a display set it really needed Robin.</p>

<p>Batman himself looks accurate to me with his dark blue and grey suit. The cape is a nice soft cloth and comes in a cardboard box that finally has no sellotape on it. Batman has 3 Batarangs with him.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As you would expect after seeing the car, you get a lot of black plates, tiles and slopes, curved and regular. A few red pieces for the accents and only a handful of parts in contrast colours. There&#39;s a surprising 8 nexo shields in light grey. There&#39;s a sticker sheet with 10 stickers; the plaque, two for the dashboard, the bat emblem on the side and a few accents.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build starts with a display base that has a UCS-style plaque with some details of the car. When placed on top the car can rotate to be shown from different angles.</p>

<p>Next we start the car, which has a few Technic parts to hold the wheels, and two vehicle bases side by side for the middle section. The rear is built with a little&nbsp;bit of SNOT for the rocket exhaust and a nice use of the Ninjago &#39;armadillo&#39; panel for the trunk. The 1x1 brackets to close the gaps you otherwise get behind the wheel arches are a nice touch.</p>

<p>Over to the front and there&#39;s a little more SNOT building to shape the grille, followed by a good few curved slopes to shape the area around the headlights. Stud shooters are placed here but towards the end of the instructions there&#39;s an alternative option without the shooters. A nice touch to have the few extra parts for this included.</p>

<p>Finally it&#39;s the windscreens, the arch in the middle&nbsp;and the cleverly angled tail fins to complete the car.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model.</h3>

<p>The front is not entirely accurate but at this scale it&#39;s pretty good. The back is more impressive with the big fins. I&#39;m not sure what gadget the golden grille tile represents but it&#39;s way too big. The part for the curved windscreens is well chosen and placing them at an angle for the front works well.</p>

<p>Having the choice between display model or play model with stud shooter is great. I wish they&#39;d do that on Star Wars sets.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is a great looking model of an iconic car. Play functions are limited but you do have the stud shooters to aim at the jokes, and the trunk opens to store the batarangs and stud ammo. Having the display stand and the extra parts for an alternative version without the stud shooters are a great idea. Value for money is not bad. In Europe it&#39;s around 10c/part for a licensed set with two minifigs.</p>

<p>The only real downside of the set is the lack of Robin, but Bricklink will sort that ;-)</p>

<p>Starting with the minifigures, Batman is *almost* great, but as is he&#39;s just okay. I think the lack of a specialized cowl holds it back, but this has been an issue with LEGO for years. They seem adamant that the two cowl options they&#39;ve had for the last decade are perfect for any version of the character, but I think this figure makes a good case for why that&#39;s not true. Additionally, his legs should have been dual molded like they were in the &#39;66 Batcave from a few years ago. The all blue legs aren&#39;t a great look on the sides, but from the front, the detail is where it should be.&nbsp;My guess is that this shortcut was taken because LEGO assumed&nbsp;that most people would just keep Batman in the car where his legs wouldn&#39;t be visible. That&#39;s certainly a valid option, but this figure could have benefited from some extra effort. Joker is great, though. No notes. I might prefer his faces from the &#39;66 Batcave, but I love that this set gives him some new expressions.</p>

<p>Moving on to the Batmobile itself, this is thing is near perfect. The shape and size are just right, and it has a lot of nice details, including a bright red Bat-Phone.&nbsp;There&#39;s a pretty long trunk that can hold plenty more batarangs than this set provides. It&#39;s not quite deep enough to comfortably fit the grappling hook, but having the space at all is nice. The front hood has some stud shooters, and while they already blend in better than they do on a lot of vehicles, you also have the option to remove them entirely and replace with simple rounded slopes for a totally smooth hood (which I did).</p>

<p>This&nbsp;set was clearly made with display in mind, and it serves that purpose very well, although it also works for play about as well as any other Batmobile. The display stand is a great touch, with a stickered plaque like you&#39;d expect to see from a lot of large scale &quot;UCS&quot; type models. It would have been nice to see some more printing, but it&#39;s LEGO, what else is new?&nbsp;I wish that a stand and plaque just like this could have been included in the smaller Tumbler that released later in 2021, it really ties this set together for some great presentation.</p>

<p>This is easily one of my favorite Batmobiles LEGO has ever made (and there&#39;s a LOT of competition). It would have been nice to get Robin here as well, but I&#39;m hoping we&#39;ll get lucky and see another 1966 vehicle with him soon, such as the Batcopter or the Bat Boat.</p>
