<p>Lola Bunny is a character I acknowledge the iconicity of, but I never watched &ldquo;Space Jam&rdquo; or its recent sequel, so I am unfamiliar with the character, however this Minifigure isn&#39;t at all bad.</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a dual moulded head mould with her rabbit ears weirdly tied in a ponytail and her face is printed on the front, her torso features sporting attire and her rabbit tail and her legs are dual moulded with pink and lavender and feature side printing.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The single included accessory is a pathetic excuse for a basketball being just an orange technic ball which is unacceptable. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a bad Minifigure at all but to me is in my least favourite category of this great CMF series but my unfamiliarity with the character and lazy accessory it doesn&#39;t help it much, however people who are attempting to complete this series like me need this one, so I recommend it to them and anyone with an interest.</p>

<p>Lola is a rabbit, a female rabbit, with tannish fur and a penchant for basketball, she has been criticised by many, but honestly it&#39;s nice to see a relative newcomer included in the ranks of this short CMF Series. Her outfit does not include any nods to the Tune Squad or Toon Squad, whichever you prefer for your spelling. Instead, she&#39;s dressed in a practice outfit and her initial costume choice when first introduced if memory serves. (It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen the original movie.) She features a robust new head sculpt with pinned back ears using a purple scrunchie and her legs feature dual-molding to give her pink sneakers their proper look.</p>

<p>The only real downside with this Minifigure is the inclusion of a Technic Ball Joint in Orange to represent a basketball. Seriously, LEGO Sports themed sets of the early 2000s included actual basketball elements, would it have cost them that much to re-introduce a proper looking and sculpted basketball instead of what they wound up giving us?</p>

<p>Overall a perfectly wonderful Minfiigure with a poor showing for her accessory. Recommended.</p>
