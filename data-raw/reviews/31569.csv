However, I couldn&rsquo;t deny that the figures looked great and my love for cartoony minifigures got the best of me, so I decided to try one figure and who else to be my first figure from the series than the iconic Bugs Bunny.</p>

<p>The torso and legs are appropriately very simple with some white paws printed on the feet, white fur printed on his chest and a white fluffy tail printed on the back, a 3D tail piece would&rsquo;ve been nice but I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with what we got. The new head mold for Bugs is just brilliant, the shaping and proportions are just perfect IMO, the ears are fittingly long and the printing for the face looks amazing and adorable! Finally, as Bugs is commonly seen with a carrot in hand, his accessory is just that.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure blew away my expectations, I think Bugs translated very well&nbsp;into minifig form and Lego did a fantastic job, especially with that molded head. Even as someone who&rsquo;s never watched Looney Tunes (as of the time of writing this), I really like this figure and it honestly entices me to try out some other figures of the series. I think any fan of animated/cartoony characters could appreciate this figure. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Bugs Bunny is undoubtedly one of the most iconic cartoon characters of all time, and ever since the Looney Tunes CMF series rumour from last year started, he was my most wanted figure from that series, however I do have one accessory based quarrel but not with this figure.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has a new amazing head mould that is dual moulded in white and light grey with printing on the front, his torso is simplistic but excellent and his legs are minimalist but accurate.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory included is a carrot in orange with a green stem, now this is completely appropriate however due to Daffy Duck coming with the &ldquo;Rabbit Season&rdquo; sign I think a &ldquo;Duck Season&rdquo; sign with Bugs would have been appropriate, so the rivalry can happen in Lego but oh well. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a great figure with nothing included to complain about, he fits in great with the rest of the series, which I can&#39;t wait to complete, anyway other than the missing accessory this is a perfect figure that I highly recommend.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-03-08T20:08:21.61Z","Eh, What's Bricks, Doc?","<p><b>Set #71030 Bugs Bunny:</b>&nbsp;The most iconic animated mascot next to Mickey Mouse is finally here in all his glorious simplicity. With a very basic print for his white stomach markings his fluffy white tail and paws, Bugs stands an impressive two and half-ish inches tall with his ears. He includes a carrot to munch on, honestly though I would have hoped that LEGO would have included a half-munched carrot element to replicate his trademark nibbling on the piece whenever he asks his famous question.</p>

<p>Overall this is a very impressive offering from the Looney Tunes CMF line and a much-needed Minifigure to stand next to Disney&#39;s Mickey Mouse in your collection. Bugs and Mickey are two of the most iconic and the only one I think is missing now would either be Felix the Cat or Popeye. Highly Recommended Folks.</p>
