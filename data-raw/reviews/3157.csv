This one is a cool addition, that allows you to create houses with beautiful doors and nice windows (that can&#39;t be found now, they are not sold any longer).<br />
<br />
If you have enough bricks, you can create a really awesome house, using the elements of 631. In general this is an additional set, which together with others of this theme, like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/633-1/Roof-Tiles"">633</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/801-2/Extra-Bricks-Blue"">801</a>, allow you to make several more buildings in Lego town.</p>

<p><strong>-Update-</strong><br />
The set includes 2 kinds of red doors &ndash; ones for a villa and ones with glass suitable for offices and shops. There 6 small windows, and 8 classic frames with shutters, which are no longer produced by Lego.</p>

<p>These windows with shutters are personally one of my favourites, as they add cosiness to your creations. However, the hinges are quite weak and can break easily over time. I guess, that&#39;s the reason for their disappearance from modern sets.</p>
