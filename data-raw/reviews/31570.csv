<p>Wile E.Coyote is a Looney Tune who provides the role of villain&nbsp;and one of sympathy, but this minifigure&nbsp;provides neither, it provides quality.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a dual moulded exclusive head which brilliantly captures the character&#39;s likeness, a simplistic torso which shows his scraggly fur, a reddish brown werewolf tail and some simplistic reddish brown legs.</p>

<p>The accessory-</p>

<p>His only accessory is an anvil built with a dark grey colour scheme with a stamp piece handle and a cheese slope end. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is another CMF great, the figure represents perfectly and even the brick built accessory is perfect, that&#39;s why I highly recommend this Minifigure.</p>

Coyote:</b>&nbsp;Here we find Acme&#39;s biggest customer, purchaser of Flying Suits, Rocket Powered Skates, Cannons, Explosives and Giant Magnets with Magnetic Birdseed all for the express purpose to capture the Road Runner and have a decent meal.</p>

<p>Makes one wonder how he afforded everything from Acme, but failed to have enough to buy take-out. Anyway, questioning sixty-year-old cartoon logics aside, Wile E. as a Minifigure is a very impressive looking character. He features a brand new head sculpt with long ears and a crafty expression printed upon the face, has limited torso printing for detailing to match the animation model and includes a small buildable anvil. No doubt so he can cross a wire and pounce upon the unsuspecting Road Runner. Alas the anvil does not include ACME printing, which would have been a nice nod, but considering the elements used in its constructions I can see where that would be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>This is a great looking addition to the Minifigure collection from Warner Brothers, the head sculpt is superbly handled and looks brilliant. I would recommend this Minifigure for any fans of the character. Recommended.</p>
