"ForestMenOfEndor","2021-06-11T23:28:19.467Z","Shockingly better than expected!","<p>I was very underwhelmed by the online images of this Looney Tunes CMF series, yet I have a habit of buying at least one random CMF every time I visit our local LEGO store. So ... now, our family has a Tweety Bird and a Road Runner. And they are MUCH&nbsp;better looking &quot;in the brick&quot; and actually rather fun to own!</p>

<p>I decided to write a review of Road Runner, in particular, because of the fantastic accessory parts that come packaged with the minifigure (who looks SO much less awkward IRL). The flame yellow &quot;popcorn/icecream&quot; piece can be a number of things, and the sand green bowl is AMAZING.&nbsp;I am, admittedly, a sand green parts junkie.</p>

<p>Even the minifigure&nbsp;parts could be used for minifig MOCs or in other interesting ways. For example, RR&#39;s head plume would be perfect for a custom knight&#39;s helmet, and the tail would be a perfect &quot;cartoony&quot; splash of water, or of course it could be used for a more realistic looking bird sculpture. In fact, the more that I think about it, the more I want to buy multiples of this &quot;set&quot; for just those uses.</p>

<p>Overall, I was expecting this to be a 2/5, but for the above reasons, it&#39;s a 5/5 for me.</p>

<p>Road Runner is a character with what only can be described as &#39;Looney Tunes&#39; proportions, which makes a building system like Lego struggle coming up with how it should work whilst still resembling the character, this figure, probably being the least accurate of the amazing CMF series released this year, is still satisfactory on its own.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The feather situated ontop of his head is a new and exclusive piece in blue attached with a mini-peg-hole, his head is Quadruple moulded with white, baby blue, blue and yellowish orange with the pupils printed, the torso is unprinted with the Chicken Suit Guys arms in blue which work well, he has a large new tail mould in baby blue made out of a rubbery material and his legs are in dark orange with slight feet printing.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory, much like the accessory of Wile E. Coyote, is an object used against the figure included, in this case being bird&nbsp; feed as bait, it is in a sand green bowl with a 1&times;1 red stud inside to elevate a yellowish orange ice cream piece for seed.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a good figure despite its proportional inaccuracies, which did somewhat detract in the images but in person it looks quite good, so I recommend it.</p>

<p>Road Runner has extremely minimal print detailing on him, aside from the unique head piece with pupil printing the Minifigure features only two thin lines on his toes to hint at the talons his feet represent. The torso is a re-use of Chicken Suit Guy in a light blue with dark blue wings, a new attachable tail piece is included to capture the proper look and proportions of Road Runner&#39;s tail. Sitting next to him on his little stand is a bowl of birdseed using the ice cream/popcorn piece and a few additional elements to look proper.</p>

<p>Overall this is a simple looking Minifigure made with new and pre-existing parts that works quite well to approximate the look of the character in LEGO form. It could be argued that they might have improved the creation of this character by making a unique element similar to Scooby-Doo to better capture the likeness, but since this for the Collectible Minifigures line a unique sculpted element such as that would be out of the question. I would recommend picking it up for fans of the character as it goes well with Wile E. on display. Recommended.</p>
