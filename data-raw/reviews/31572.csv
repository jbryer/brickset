"PerryThePlatypus","2021-11-19T14:40:09.193Z","I Tawt I taw a Puddy Tat!","<p>Tweety is one of the more odd figures of the Looney Tunes series. He&rsquo;s been given representation as a proper minifigure, and as a result, has completely inaccurate proportions. It seems some&nbsp;people dislike this figure because of that, but if you could overlook the size inaccuracy, this makes for a pretty enjoyable figure.</p>

<p>Tweety comes with short legs in orange with printing of black gaps to indicate the toes. Tweety&rsquo;s torso print is appropriately very simple with just a single line on the front and a tail printed on the back. The new mold introduced here is the head piece, it captures the look of Tweety perfectly, with the tiny orange beak, the large eyes and eyelashes, and the tufts of hair on the top of the head. Finally, his accessory is a wonderfully cartoonishly oversized brick-built mallet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, while I like this figure, I still would&rsquo;ve preferred Tweety to be represented as a new one-piece accessory (similar to<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/toy021/ducky"">&nbsp;Ducky&nbsp;</a>from Toy Story 4) to go along with Sylvester. Though even as one of the weaker figures of the series, it still remains an enjoyable and fun figure, and I would certainly recommend this to fans of Looney Tunes</p>

<h3>That&rsquo;s all Folks!</h3>

<p>Tweety Bird is among the most iconic Looney Tunes characters, so it was a given that they would be present in this CMF. However, I believe that he would be better suited in a different format.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has an exclusive head mould with the eyes and beak printed, a torso with as minimal printing as possible and some short legs with minor prints.</p>

<p>The accessory-</p>

<p>The accessory is an oversized hammer, it has a reddish brown long pole for the handle, and three 2&times;2 round bricks with one dark brown technic one in the middle. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a great Minifigure, although I think he would have made a fantastic Ducky-style accessory for Sylvester The Cat however I&nbsp; do still recommend him.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-03-28T15:35:16.353Z","A Tweety Bird!","<p><b>Set #71030 Tweety Bird:</b>&nbsp;When it comes to iconic antagonists the next famous one outside of Road Runner and Wile E. is Sylvester and Tweety, the cat and bird duo is well known to Looney Tunes fans and it is fitting that this Series include both iconic characters.</p>

<p>Tweety is using another new head sculpt, a curious note, this new head features a small hole in the top that, if I&#39;m very much not mistaken, can accommodate accessories found in the Friends line for hair, to me that says LEGO is planning a re-use of this part as either the Tiny Toons female character or some other female version of Tweety.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Tweety, using minimal printing on the torso and short legs we have all of his bird features, his cute little tail, his talons and a little tuft on his chest to represent feathers. But Tweety is notoriously packing some real attitude, his accessory is a large brick-built mallet to whack the fingers of poor Sylvester. It&#39;s his most famous bit, Sylvester, hanging from a window ledge or clothesline will have each finger smacked until there are no more fingers. The hammer is nice and all, but it is rather large compared to Tweety.</p>

<p>Overall I find myself recommending all of the famous Merry Melodies gang because they have some really great looking parts. On top of that they are iconic and will look great standing side-by-side with all of the currently available Walt Disney Minifigures. Recommended.</p>
