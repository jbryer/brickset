I did see a Puddy Tat!","<p>In a Looney Tunes minifigure Series, there are bound to have characters that aren&rsquo;t exactly a right fit for minifigure representation, the execution remains good throughout though. Sylvester is one of those characters that lend themselves perfectly for minifigure representation in my opinion and he came out pretty well.</p>

<p>The legs are a dual-molded design with black gaps on the feet to indicate toes, and printing of the white fur pattern that continues to the side. Attached at the hip is a cat tail piece with a white tip. The torso print is simple but well done, with the white fur printed on the front, the white against black could&rsquo;ve been slightly brighter, but it&rsquo;s actually not too noticeable, so not really an issue. The dual-molded head features brilliant shaping that perfectly captures the look of the character, the print work is excellent as well, I love the pronounced red nose. Finally, Sylvester comes with a regular bat to help him unsuccessfully catch Tweety Bird.</p>

<p>Overall, Sylvester is another well-executed figure in the series. The white print on his chest could&rsquo;ve been slightly improved, but otherwise, this figure is perfect, and it captures the look of Sylvester spectacularly. I would strongly recommend this figure for fans of Looney Tunes and cartoony minifigures.</p>

<p>Sylvester includes some very nice printing for his feline features, the feet are printed to resemble paws while also being dual-molded to properly reflect the look of the character with black legs and white paws. His torso has printing to indicate his fur covered belly and his new head piece has been sculpted to exacting detail. For an added accessory he comes with a baseball bat, to whack Tweety over the head and then devour.</p>

<p>Overall the Looney Tunes series is a breath of fresh air, each Minifigure has minimal printing and doesn&#39;t go too far when incorporating the look of the animated characters, the accessories unfortunately are rather hit or miss, most of them so far are kind of just bland and generic props without truly standing out as anything that could not have been put together with parts from existing LEGO sets. I suppose that is a problem when transitioning old cartoon characters into LEGO form, and the &#39;props&#39; are acceptable accessories for the group to use. I just wish there was a bit more variety and Looney-ness to the accessories. Still I recommend all of them if you&#39;re looking for a decent collection of licensed cartoon favourites.</p>

<p>The 2021 LEGO&nbsp;<em>Looney Tunes</em>&nbsp;CMF series feels like the distant past; but we shan&#39;t forget the high quality of these now-nearly two-year-old figures; particularly the menace himself&nbsp;<em>Sylvester the Cat</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure -</strong></p>

<p>His head is brilliantly dual moulded, and his big red nose is printed on, the torso is appropriately simplistic in design and the tail has a nice detail of a little white-tuft at the end. The legs have some excellent printing, which wraps around the front and sides of his dual moulded legs.</p>

<p><b>The Accessory -&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><i>Sylvester the Cat&nbsp;</i>has had a vast range of weapons over the years, with his included one being a standard LEGO baseball bat, which is perfectly fine. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p><strong>In Conclusion -</strong></p>

<p><em>Sylvester the Cat&nbsp;</em>was a necessary and very well-done inclusion. The&nbsp;figure is perfect in every way. However, it seems that it would&#39;ve been more appropriate to include&nbsp;<em>Tweety Bird&nbsp;</em>as an accessory instead of as a separate figure. Nonetheless, this figure is excellent, despite&nbsp;the series&#39; overall shortcoming.&nbsp;</p>
