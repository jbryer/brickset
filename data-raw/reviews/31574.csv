<p>Daffy Duck is a Looney Tunes character that I respect for its iconicity but isn&#39;t one of my favourites however this Minifigure rendition is very well done .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure has a triple moulded exclusive head in black, white and orange , a simplistic torso with a feather printed , the Donald Duck tail in black and some dual moulded black and orange legs .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The single included accessory is a 1&times;4 redish brown bar with a yellow sign with the iconic &#39;rabbit season&#39; written on it, but unfortunately there is no &#39;duck season&#39; to rival it with big chung... I mean Bugs Bunny . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is a surprisingly great figure from the best series in the last 2-3 released ,the accuracy is on point with that of the Simpsons figures so I highly recommend it .</p>

And AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","<p><b>Set #71030 Daffy Duck:</b>&nbsp;It is interesting to note that we have seen up to this point six characters and for the most part each set of two has been a nemesis of sorts to one another. Aside from Bugs and Lola who are not enemies, per se, the rest of the series has included typical pairs, Wile E. vs Road Runner, Tweety vs. Sylvester.</p>

<p>Daffy here might be likened to Bugs&#39; nemesis, but he is more commonly used as a dramatic thespian with delusions of grandeur, hence the name Daffy. Our favourite looney duck features an all black torso with minimal printing, dual-molded legs featuring black and orange for his feet and a nice unique perfectly sculpted head that features the traditional Daffy appearance. He also comes with the tail element introduced with Donald and the Disney Duck clan. A printed sign saying Rabbit Season is included as an accessory, a very welcome accessory with an iconic short and gag to its name.</p>

<p>Overall Daffy is a perfectly brilliant looking character brought to LEGO life. There has been no word on more Looney Tunes to date, but I wouldn&#39;t say no to more of this series, especially if we could get Daffy at his best as Robin Hood and DUCK DOGERS OF THE TWENTY-THIRD AND A HALF CENTURY! Ahem... Highly Recommended.</p>

Bugs is let down by a too-round headship that almost looks more like a balloon of Bugs than Bugs himself, as well as poor printing for the white details on his torso and feet that don&#39;t match the crisp white plastic on his face. Daffy has no such problems, his production is astoundingly perfect. The head is triple moulded, ensuring his eyes and neck ring are pure white, his feathers are pure black, and his beak is a suitably vibrant orange. The only printing he has are his pupils and a little tuft of feathers on his torso, and that&#39;s all he needs, everything else is moulded in, and it&#39;s incredibly impressive how perfectly they captured his look while still keeping him looking like a Lego figure. His accessory, the iconic &quot;Rabbit Season&quot; sign, is also much better than the generic carrot Bugs gets, and it all rounds out to an absolutely flawless little CMF release. If you only get one CMF from the Looney Tunes series, make sure it&#39;s this little guy.</p>
