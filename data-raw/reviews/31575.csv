"Minifig290","2021-04-20T18:39:24.073Z","The Cheese Slopes","<p>Hello, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at one of the 12 LEGO Minifigures from the new 71030 Looney Toons series releasing April 26th 2021. Retailing at &pound;3.49 / &pound;4.99 a pack with varying numbers of pieces.</p>

<p>In this review I&#39;ll be looking at Speedy Gonzales who has 8 pieces including the stand giving him a price per piece of 43p/62c. He also contains some extra pieces.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a detailed look then.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Speedy Gonzales is like almost every other figure in this series that contains a new exclusive moulded head piece. Gonzales head piece most eye-catching feature is his large yellowish orange sombrero that is daulmoulded onto his head. Gonzales&#39; mouse head is a dark nougat with a black printing for his nose, whiskers and hair.&nbsp;His ears have a tan printing in the middle. Finally, for his head the large cartoonish eyes are printed with a white base and black for his pupils and some printing above each one.</p>

<p>The iconic white outfit that Gonzales wears is replicated almost perfectly in this figure, which his white torso having the print for his red handkerchief around his neck, with his hands being the dark nougat used for his head. Sadly there is no back printing of any sorts. His mini legs are daulmoulded with white on the top half and dark nougat on the bottom, with two small lines to show his toes.</p>

<p>Between Gonzales legs and torso is a dark nougat tailpiece which I believe is new for this figure, with it curving to a smooth tip, this piece is rubber and attaches at the hip. My only complaint is that the front of the tail can be seen between his white clothing. This should have been printed as it was for Scrooge Duck in the Disney Series 2 cmfs from 2019.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Speedy Gonzales has three identical accessories, a 1x1 cheese slope piece in yellow printed ironically with slopes of cheese. These are all the same containing 5 holes of varying sizes representing a Swiss cheese. Each figure including Gonzales also include the standard 3x4 black minifigure stand that has been in the CMFs since they were released back in 2010.</p>

<p><strong>Spare pieces</strong></p>

<p>This figure only contains one extra piece, an additional 1x1 cheese slope printed with the cheese giving a total of 4 in each bag.</p>

<p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude, this figure is amazing and well detailed and put together, with the three cheese slope prints adding a lot to this figure. My biggest complaint is that the front of the tail shows through from the front and sides, something they could have prevented by printing or daulmoulding the piece.</p>

<p>The value for this figure despite being slightly expensive you are getting your moneys worth in this series with each and every figure including Gonzales. I highly recommend picking up some or all of the figures from this series.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Moulding and printing, Cheese slope pieces</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Tail not being printed at the front to match with rest of figure</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These go on sale April 26th at LEGO Shop but can be found earlier at supermarkets and local toy stores. Got mine early from WHSmith&nbsp;in the UK.</p>

"Spruce","2021-05-03T02:23:24.153Z","Speedy Gonzales, Collectable Minifigure 71030-8","<p><strong>Pre-Release Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I was initially quite excited at the prospect of a Looney Toons CMF series. Speedy Gonzalez is one of my favorite characters, and as a Mexican, I can&#39;t help but be endeared by this cartoonish character.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This minifigure is a&nbsp;simple, but effective one. The head mold is so detailed and the printing on it is flawless. It is truly a testament to how far LEGO&#39;s production has come. The torso is simple but surprisingly useful. It has only a small red bow tie on it. The tan tail color does not fit with the white outfit that Speedy wears, but this can be ignored easily. The legs continue the very simple aesthetic of the figure, with only some dual molding and small marks to represent the toes of the fastest mouse in all Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>The accessory is one of the biggest draws for this figure. Speedy holds cheese wedges printed on cheese slopes. This is a highly requested piece, and will certainly draw non-Looney Tunes fans to this figure. The figure comes with 4, one being an extra.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>This figure is worth five dollars, and I feel with the Collectible Minifigures theme transitioning into more detailing figures, the price bump makes sense. Still, 5 dollars is a significant amount for something so small.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Cheese slopes</li>
	<li>Useful minifigure parts</li>
	<li>Detailed head mold</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Expensive for only a minifigure</li>
	<li>The tail looks out of place</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Speedy Gonzales is certainly an iconic character portrayed perfectly in LEGO. I strongly encourage you to go out and get some figures from the new LEGO Looney Tunes CMF series!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-04-06T18:07:45.86Z","Ariba, Ariba, Ariba!","<p><b>Set #71030 Speedy Gonzales:</b>&nbsp;How fitting that Speedy would be included in this wave next to Daffy on the checklist, Speedy has often been featured in cartoons with Daffy as a nemesis/foil. Possibly Sylvester too, I honestly haven&#39;t watched classic Looney Tunes in a while.</p>

<p>Speedy is the fastest mouse in all of Mexico, and his plain printing looks great, like the animation cell given physical brick form. With dual-molded legs and what I believe to be a new mousy tail piece, Speedy is quite an impressive looking character. He includes four cheese slopes, printed with actual cheese print. An excellent accessory for this speedy little mouse, he always gets all the cheese.</p>

<p>Overall Speedy is a great addition to this theme and I&#39;m impressed with how nicely the head sculpt came out. His new tail element will also be highly useful if they make more mice characters, Jerry Mouse, Basil of Baker Street, Bernard and Bianca from Disney. Oh I do hope we get more classic Disney and Warner Brothers&#39; Minifigures in the future. Recommended.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-12-20T12:18:13.613Z","Good Minifigure of a less prominent Looney Tunes icon! ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>During recent negotiations, I have managed to acquire 5 out of the 7 Looney Tunes CMFs that I was missing. One of these being Speedy Gonzales, who I am reviewing now.</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The Minifigure has a dual moulded yellowish orange and nougat coloured head with facial printing, a simplistic white torso with little printing, a tail mould in nougat, and some dual moulded white and nougat short legs with tiny toe prints.</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories are three identical 1&times;1 yellow cheese slopes with cheese printed which are very useful out of context. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a pretty good Minifigure of a not particularly well known character, so I recommend it to Minifigure fans and Looney Tunes fans alike.</p>
