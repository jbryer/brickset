Tasmanian Devil hasn&rsquo;t appeared in too many classic shorts but he&rsquo;s one of the most iconic Looney Tunes characters, and his representation in minifigure form looks marvelous!</p>

<p>Starting from the legs, it uses mid-legs with some toe printing to good effect, making the figure short and stocky compared to the other characters which I love. Taz comes with a brown tail hip attachment just like Wile E. The torso doesn&rsquo;t require any printing as the new molded head goes over the torso completely. The new head piece is fantastic, the mouth is appropriately huge and wide open with printing for his tongue and sharp teeth. Other features like his relatively small ears and tufts of hair are present as well and looks phenomenal. To recreate Taz&rsquo;s iconic spinning action, a printed 4x4 round tile with a rounded plate attached below it is included and it pretty much works like a top. It spins decently well if you remove his accessories and spin him without too much force, it&rsquo;s pretty fun to play around with,&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m pleased with its inclusion. Finally, as Taz has a high metabolism, he has a turkey drumstick and a pie as his accessories, both of which are great to obtain.</p>

<p>Overall, Lego did a great job representing Looney Tunes characters to minifigure form and Taz is no exception. I honestly don&rsquo;t have anything to complain about with this figure, it&rsquo;s simply great. The accessories are awesome and the spinning tile is a nice bonus, I&rsquo;m so glad it was included. Definitely a must-have for Looney Tunes fans or fans of cartoony minifigures.</p>

<h3>That&#39;s all Folks!</h3>

<p>Taz or The Tasmanian Devil is one of Looney Tunes best characters and I think makes LEGOs best figure of this CMF series.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a dual moulded head with his large mouth and teeth showing, an unprinted torso, a reddish brown werewolf tail and reddish brown mid-legs.</p>

<p>The accessories-&nbsp;</p>

<p>His accessories include a pie and chicken drumstick for his snack, along with a 4x4 white dish with a tornado printed and an inverted tile underneath for an ineffective spinning method. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think Taz may the best of the series,&nbsp;his detail and accuracy is immaculate, and he provides a very interesting Minifigure and that is why I highly recommend him.</p>

Having a very minimal print, the character is mostly made with brown LEGO elements, his head is a new sculpt of course and he includes two food items as accessories, a pie and turkey leg.</p>

<p>Where this Minifigure shines is the additional printed tile, a large circle tile printed with cartoony looking tornado imagery is part of the play feature for this Minifigure, it doesn&#39;t always work as well as it might, but you can spin the Tasmanian Devil to simulate his ability to travel via tornado spin. This makes for a great bit of fun and a unique idea for a Collectible Minifigure.</p>

<p>Overall this is a solid offering, the parts are an impressive selection for customs, the head is brilliant designed and looks great with all of the toon printing to make the character. Even the re-used Chima tail piece is a nice inclusion. About the only negatives I can say about it are the spinning disc doesn&#39;t quite spin properly all the time. But it&#39;s still a nifty idea. Recommended.</p>
