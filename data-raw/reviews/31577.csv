"8BrickMario","2022-08-13T23:20:28.32Z","A rather charming little extraterrestrial, wouldn't you say?","<p>I&#39;m oddly attached to Marvin the Martian out of the Looney Tunes cast, and I think it&#39;s mostly a matter of presentation. His character design is great, his voice is so memorable, and he&#39;s such an eye-catching presence. No retro alien quite approaches Marv. I was excited to get this figure, despite my reservations about his translation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While the choice is debatable, Marvin is all made of standard minifig parts, lending a fun head and headgear piece anybody can use. His torso is plain, but it&#39;s nice to see more mid-length legs, the fabric piece for his skirt could be fun and his lime ray gun is a nice addition to the piece&#39;s colors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>Marvin&#39;s definitely a bit&nbsp;hard to digest among the rest in the series because he&#39;s just as, if not more exaggerated in proportion than the other characters, and the standard minifig parts are ill-equipped to match that. Marvin&#39;s always had a big spherical head and a skinny body, so the small cylinder head and wide body look a bit strange-I was surprised they didn&#39;t try to make a custom head for him, though I guess we get a new minifig helmet thanks to this approach. When viewed on his own, you get used to him and he looks alright, and I think the mid-legs were a good choice for this stringy little guy. The helmet is nicely dual-molded with the brush-like centurion crest, and his eyes are a simple but accurate print for his head. His torso has no detail save for the white hands for his gloves, and his legs attempt to represent his sneakers, but the visual doesn&#39;t quite land, at least, not with the white&nbsp;only being on the toes. The skirt is nice and flexible, but as a fabric piece, it feels a little too thin and doesn&#39;t look as good on such a flat and wide body. I also think the greens on Marvin ought to have been the dark olive color, which the actual classic cartoons used more often, rather than the lighter green you&#39;ll see more in marketing. He&#39;s still cute and recognizable.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>

<p>This Marvin toy is flawed. His proportions aren&#39;t even approached by the minifigure shape and some choices leave his distinctive features like his shoes and skirt feeling underplayed. All the same, he&#39;s still Marvin and definitely isn&#39;t awful and may look better the longer you have him.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-11-19T14:39:49.85Z","I claim the tenth spot of this series in the name of Mars!","<p>After getting into Looney Tunes because of the minifigure series, Marvin the Martian has quickly become one of my favorite characters from the franchise for his adorable design and memorable voice. So naturally, I became excited to get my hands on the Marvin figure.</p>

<p>Marvin sports white shoes that are printed on the feet, print&nbsp;continues to the side of the mid-legs as well which is great, and&nbsp;his torso is appropriately plain and unprinted. A new bright green cloth skirt piece is used here, and it perfectly replicates its on-screen appearance. Marvin is the only figure in the Looney Tunes series to use the regular minifigure head, and it has a pair of eyes printed on it, an alternate expression where he&rsquo;s very angry indeed would&rsquo;ve been welcome, but it&rsquo;s ok without it. Marvin&rsquo;s iconic Roman inspired helmet uses a brand new dual-molded piece with bright green for the helmet itself and an orangish yellow for the broom plume, it looks absolutely perfect and spot-on. Finally, the accessory is a laser gun in lime for the first time I believe, I think the Retro Spaceman laser gun would&rsquo;ve been better, but it&rsquo;s still a nice addition to the many colors of the ray gun piece</p>

<p>Overall, while some distinct features like Marvin&rsquo;s exaggerated feet and thin appearance couldn&rsquo;t exactly be replicated, I don&rsquo;t mind at all, I think this figure captures the iconic character quite well, and I&rsquo;m more than happy with how it came out. This adorable extraterrestrial would make a great addition to anyone&rsquo;s collection.</p>

<h3>That&rsquo;s All Folks!</h3>

"Odeinoichus","2022-04-06T20:15:06.447Z","Where's the Kaboom?","<p><b>Set #71030 Marvin The Martian:</b>&nbsp;Ah yes, what self-respecting Looney Tunes collector could ever consider their collection complete before they managed to acquire one of the, if not the, most iconic and most remembered villains to ever face down Bugs Bunny. This loveably crafted Minifigure features some excellent looking parts with some minimal printing.</p>

<p>The only printing on the Minifigure in fact are his two cartoony looking oversized eyes and the sandals he&#39;s wearing on his feet. He includes a green skirt piece which I think is completely brand new to capture the likeness of the character. He includes a lime green ray gun element and a brand new helmet piece with the Roman Centurion in Space look famously captured by the animators over at Warner Brothers. Everything about this character is spot-on and I just adore it. The only thing that I might have used to improve the overall look would be to include extra accessories, a printed tile to represent his box of instant Martians (just add water) and the power conductor for his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator.</p>

<p>An enjoyable and excellent addition to the cast and crew of the Looney Tunes Collectible Minifigures collection. Highly Recommended.</p>

"Pollywanna","2022-07-13T21:33:19.95Z","Almost perfect, almost","<p>Marvin is probably the most disappointing of the Looney Tunes CMFs for me, not because he&#39;s the worst, but because he&#39;s so close to perfect, and yet so far. The decision to use a minifig head and give him a specially moulded helmet instead of a comically bulbous head was a stroke of genius, it keeps him looking extremely Lego-like, enables you to use the iconic Martian helmet on any figure you like, and it enables an alternate face to be printed on the back of the head - and with a character like Marvin, with two and only two iconic expressions, the big round eyes and the sharply angled angry ones, he really demands two faces. But for some bizarre reason, Lego never bothered, and so we have a perpetually happy Marvin who can never express the comic rage that he&#39;s most famous for, which ultimately isn&#39;t much of a Marvin at all. What makes this especially disappointing is Marvin has no torso or arm printing at all, unlike several other figures in this series, so it&#39;s not like printing on the back of his head would have dramatically broken the budget.<br />
<br />
The other disappointment is his kilt - It&#39;s a nicely produced fabric piece, but it lacks the thickness that&nbsp;his kilt has in the cartoons, being quite literally paper thin. I understand the need to keep his legs poseable, but the plastic ballerina tutu doesn&#39;t seem to have presented any issues for designers before, and I really think he would have benefited immensely from a similar piece to that. As for the objection that he already has a unique mold for his helmet, and so any additional molds would be overbudget, Road Runner received two unique molds and resulted in a much less impressive figure.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A final but much more minor issue is his raygun - he&#39;s never been depicted with a lime green gun, the iconic colour for his sidearm is yellow, and it remains an unproduced colour so it would have been nice to see, but you can really overlook that.<br />
<br />
Overall, there was real potential for greatness here, but they just dropped the ball with their penny pinching.&nbsp;</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-12-21T11:17:30.723Z","Another great figure from a brilliant CMF series!","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Marvin The Martian is a Looney Tune who needs no introduction, and his minifigure variant works fantastically.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has an exclusive dual moulded helmet with his broom-like topper above, a black head with his cartoony large eyes printed predominantly, he has an unprinted red torso, a cloth piece for his waist accessory and red mid-legs with lovely detailing around the feet.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Accessory-</p>

<p>His only accessory is a lime green ray gun which is entirely appropriate for this minifigure. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is another fantastic minifigure from this great series, he seriously has no flaws! That is why I recommend Marvin The Martian to anyone who has a vague interest as they will not be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>
