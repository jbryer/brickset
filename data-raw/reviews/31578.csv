<p>Petunia Pig is a very little known Looney Tunes character, and LEGO only included her so Lola Bunny wouldn&#39;t be the only female slot taken in the series,&nbsp;and whilst this character isn&#39;t particularly desirable, I think that is perfectly acceptable as for her inclusion.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>She has an exclusive dual moulded head with bow and face printing, a simplistic yellow torso with dual moulded arms, a skirt piece in red and mid-legs with undergarment printing.</p>

<p>The accessories-</p>

<p>The included accessories are rather bland, being a white tea cup and teapot. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a good Minifigure&nbsp;but not one of desired interest, although I find her inclusion as a character odd, I find the purpose it serves very acceptable, so that is why I recommend it to Looney Tunes fanatics&nbsp;and anyone who likes what they see.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-04-07T15:51:56.893Z","Rare Character.","<p><b>Set #71030 Petunia Pig:</b>&nbsp;Many people who don&#39;t watch the old shorts or look up things online are going to not recognise this character, even this casual fan of Looney Tunes had to look up who she was because honestly, I know Bugs, Daffy, Sam, Elmer, Porky, Wile E., Tweety and a bunch of others, but Porky Pig&#39;s wife? And the fact that he&#39;s married? Sure didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>Petunia Pig here in her Minifigure form represents a look of the character that is more well-recieved compared to her original animation model. Her torso and legs have limited printing, giving the appearance of a collar on her blouse, her little piggy toes and the frilly under portion of the skirt she&#39;s wearing. This skirt piece was first used for some of the Disney Minifigures, this bright red shade is new for this character and features no printing.</p>

<p>Her accessories include a tea pot and cups, her head is sculpted to include hair elements with bows and she looks specatcular. That being said, she&#39;s the only character I failed to recognise from the first offering of Looney Tunes Minifigures and with her inclusion here I am hopeful that this means we shall see a Series 2 of this Theme so we can get the likes of Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe Le Pew and many more just like her.</p>

<p>Highly Impressive. Recommended.</p>
