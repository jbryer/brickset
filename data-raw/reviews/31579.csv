<p>Porky is sporting his traditional blue coat with white gloves, he is sporting his red bow-tie and uses the medium short legs, a fact that truly helps match his stature. His head piece is excellently sculpted and captures the likeness of the character faithfully, if LEGO had included a hole for accessories they could have capitalised on this sculpt for future Three Little Pigs releases in the Disney sub-theme, but that is unimportant. Porky carries a sign built out of common LEGO elements featuring a printed tile&nbsp;with his catchphrase written across it.</p>

<p>Overall a solid offering for the finale of this Sub-Theme and hopefully not the last we will see of it. Porky is an excellent design and I wholeheartedly recommend him. Until next time. Strongly Recommended.</p>
