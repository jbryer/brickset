Lastly, no I did not buy these, they were inherited.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

In fact, it always fits in your kind of town. My more industrial (harbour etc.) part of town fits perfect to the grey roads, and most houses or my airport is better with the green ones, so they are all needed!
By the way, the free space on the curved road is quite large, you can build some stuff on it to make your city more lively.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I am sorry to see that they have been updated since I was a kid but things change over time. I still have these plates and am so happy that they survived my mom's purging of my childhood LEGO!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
