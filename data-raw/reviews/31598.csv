","<p>At this point everyone is well aware of this set, and probably way too familiar with its disastrous release. Well I don&#39;t want to sound ungrateful after being lucky enough to get a copy, but for those of you who didn&#39;t, you aren&#39;t missing out on much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will admit that I&#39;m not at all familiar with the Ulysses, but seeing how I am familiar with the Space Shuttle (after all, I am human), I wanted to get this set as a companion to the shuttle which I ordered along with this set.&nbsp;My sets arrived today, and I decided to build this one first as it is smaller and could easily be completed tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>First off, the box is rather unimpressive. I&#39;ve heard about these yellow boxes here on Brickset, however I didn&#39;t really know what they were. Well now I know, they are generic boxes with a cutout in the front that the instructions are displayed through. I can&#39;t even begin to express how disappointing this was. My main experience with GWP sets is from Star Wars May the 4th promotions which are always packaged beautifully and give you the sense that you have something special. To make matters worse, you open up the box and everything is just in a regular ziplock bag, not even a Lego logo on it. There is a small sticker on the bottom right hand corner of the bag with the set number, and in case you are wondering, the set is for ages 10 and up. Furthermore, there are no extra bricks, not that I need the 1x1s, but this set has the feeling of Lego ordered it on Bricklink. Perhaps the reason for the delay in releasing it was because the seller they bought from only ships once a week!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;The instructions are simple and to the point, a picture on the cover, and the rest is just instructions, not even a picture of the model next to the Discovery. I&#39;m fine with this, I actually appreciate how it doesn&#39;t have cartoons on a set that is clearly intended for adults.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is rather enjoyable and very similar to the Saturn V set. Obviously it is a little repetitive given it is a round symmetrical build, but no big deal. It is a small build so you don&#39;t really mind the repetition. Having built the Saturn V, nothing here blew me away as being amazing, but for someone who hasn&#39;t completed a similar build, you can certainly learn some new techniques from this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Model</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clearly this a display piece as it offers really no play value, so how the model looks is pretty important. Furthermore, as a companion piece to the Discovery set, it ought to look good together with it. As I said, I built this first, but afterwards I opened up the Discovery set and built the Hubble Telescope, which is the first three bags of that set. I figured seeing the two together would be nice. Well this is clearly where Lego struck out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the first thing you build in this set is the display name, which is actually printed (the only reason why you might be upset about missing out on this set). This to me was a very pleasant surprise. The $200 Discovery set offers the same exact display for the Hubble Telescope, but with a sticker. Seriously Lego, you can print a promotional set, but not a $200 set? Anyways, I&#39;m much happier with the printed display, but here is the problem. Besides the different look between printed and sticker, the designs do not share the same format. Both feature NASA and ESA logos at the top, but they are different sizes and the black space around them is also different. Then of course the data on each one is completely different. It just doesn&#39;t give you the sense of cohesiveness that you would expect from this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the model itself, I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m not familiar with the source material, but the photo on the instructions and all the promotional material show it as white and gold. However the model features no gold, just bright yellow like a 80&#39;s minifigure. Not great, but here is the bigger problem. The Hubble Telescope is a beautiful silver model that shines like an Airstream RV and is wonderfully detailed. Sitting next to it, the Ulysses looks like a toy (and I do realize it is a toy). This model really needed to be gold, even if Lego wanted to be cheap and not use a shiny gold, certainly pearl gold would have looked fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately I do have one more complaint about this set, and that is the lack of a display stand. Seeing how the Discovery and Hubble both come with stands, it will look very awkward having this just laying down next to them. I realize it adds cost to a promotional set, but if it&#39;s to be a companion, then that cost would have been well justified and I would have gladly coughed up a few more VIP points.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>As horrendous as the release of this set was, for those of you who didn&#39;t get it, you aren&#39;t missing much. I wouldn&#39;t want to sell mine, but I also would never pay the absurd prices being asked for this set on the second hand market. The best thing I can say for it is it&#39;s an enjoyable build. Sadly I feel that Lego missed the mark on more than just the roll out. I normally wouldn&#39;t be so critical of a free gift, but when I&#39;m buying a $200 set for it to go with, I expected much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s ignore the debacle regarding the ability to actually obtain it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a pretty good set, larger than I was expecting and when I google&nbsp;images of the actual satellite it&#39;s a fair representation of the real thing.</p>

<p>BUILD</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got the Saturn V then you&#39;ll find the build experience familiar, with an inner core allowing SNOT panels to be constructed in four sections. It&#39;s a bit wobbly until the panels are added though. The printed plaque is a nice feature - this&nbsp;sits well with the Discovery and Hubble plaques.</p>

<p>The designer has&nbsp;used yellow to replace the gold heat shielding of the real thing and I think that it was a missed opportunity to use at least a little gold on the satellite itself (the yellow bit at the top, which can be detached). The exhaust nozzle should have been yellow/gold though, not white.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t finished the shuttle as yet, but there doesn&#39;t appear to be any special way to fit it into the cargo&nbsp;bay for display.</p>

<p>VALUE FOR MONEY</p>

<p>1800 VIP points were required, which I understand is approx &pound;12? Seems like good value for money in my opinion for such a large set. Enough has been said about secondary market prices, but if you&#39;re willing to pay these amounts it&#39;s not about actual set value, you&#39;re paying for the exclusivity.</p>

<p>OTHER COMMENTS</p>

<p>This is my first set that I&#39;ve bought where the contents were in a single&nbsp;resealable&nbsp;bag. I think this is a great idea, however leads me to think that the packaging wasn&#39;t in house, as the bag seems to be something I could buy in the supermarket!</p>

<p>Also, the instructions are in a nifty front pocket, which also serves as the front image of the box, I&#39;ve never seen this before - it&#39;s a novel idea, which has meant that the booklet is extremely flat and neat (as opposed to finding a crumpled mess inside boxes sometimes.). The rest of the box is extremely dull. There&#39;s no backstory in the instructions.</p>

<p>All in all, if you managed to get one I think you&#39;d be pleased - especially if on display with the Shuttle and Hubble</p>
