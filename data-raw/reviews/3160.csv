I am sorry to see that they have been updated since I was a kid but things change over time. I still have these plates and am so happy that they survived my mom's purging of my childhood LEGO!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-16T02:45:55.407Z","The Road","How to describe a two piece set? The light grey 'plasphalt' (geddit?) held a print of dark green lines for what, a cycle lane? and solid white lines, much like some Danish roads. They cost a lot and you felt grateful when you finally had them fresh and new, 2nd hand often being the likely source. They are unremarkable in their appearance and quite frankly too light in colour, non-distinctive and non-detailed.<div><br></div><div><b>Pavement &amp; Sidewalk</b></div><div>Within this blankness lies their greatness. The road pieces were and are quite simply incredible. The fact that you possessed such a blank canvas, blew open your building potential in the extreme. Is it not the case that the more prints, stickers, special bits, BURPS, one piece sections and unique moulds TLG put in a set, the less scope you have in creating limitless, unique designs? The two swathes of pavement studs allow imagination overload although you could argue the large plate with just studs on it is even better?</div><div><br></div><div>The road can be built over with bridges or on the flat for parking or delivery bays. It can provide a race track or be turned in to an old overgrown track. Your smaller plateless building sets can line it, leaving enough room for a small pavement. Construction and maintenance sets are at home here, working all over it with small sets providing its life and population down any busy street. Clever builds, landscaping or just improvised book pile elevation can tilt it to make a hill and its smooth lanes can be filled with four or six stud vehicles to contain all that damn traffic Lego make and leave room for various bikes and stacks of MF pedestrians.</div><div><br></div><div>Trees, bushes, flowers and fences can convert the scene to a more country setting but the overwhelming greyness generally suggests that the theme here is Town. The possibilities are truly endless, leaving only the want for colour and design variation. Sometimes the smooth and non-connectable underside can leave a builder frustrated that they can not be snapped down on to anything but the intended use is not in question.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Jaywalking</b></div><div>Not too many road types have been produced, get these for a light grey street space to allow the imagination free reign without limit.</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3

I currently have one of these that I opened when it was sealed, and I plan to buy a lot more in order to expand my ever so growing town. If you can find these for less than 20 dollars, go for it!</p>
