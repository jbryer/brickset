this set is one good example. from today's perspective the selection of heads and torsos may not be so exciting, but back then it was one of the few ways to get female and civilian minifigs. in general there are almost no unemployed lego-people, which of course is completely unrealistic.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Joy from all the fun one can have with simple little LEGO sets like these and sorrow that many of the sets I had growing up were discarded along the way due to ageing, teenage angst and the unfortunateness of broken plastic.</p>

<p>What's not to love about a set as cheap and simple as City People? Every Town needs citizens and LEGO did a great job of providing you with plenty of opportunities to get some. Especially some really unique ones, the waiter alone in this set is an excellent little Mini-Figure and comes with some rare(?) crystal goblets. I'm not sure what the girl with the whip was meant to represent, but she's definitey fetching looking. If you ask me she should be riding a horse on a Fox Hunt with that red jacket.</p>

<p>Octan Attendants were LEGO's fuelers, they supplied services and gas to all your LEGO race cars, ordinary cars, emergency response vehicles and what ever else you fancied. I'll wager a few good space ships owe their service upkeep to the Octan Serviceman. The bike was a nice touch and the cyclist is definitely fun. (I especially liked her red hair, it stood out amongst all the dark colored hair people.) The shades dude with the life jacket and the construction worker rounded up the set nicely, not a police man or firefighter in the bunch. All a thrilling unique looking group that no City or Town can do without. I strongly recommend this set to LEGO Town enthusiasts, in fact I may just add this onto my wants list one of these days because my LEGO City could use some fresh new faces to break up the monotony of Police and Firefighters I'll eventually have. (So far it's not so bad because I haven't picked up too many LEGO City sets, but I have a feeling I'm going to need more ordinary rounded people come this time next year.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,5
