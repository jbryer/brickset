The sets and app weren&#39;t engaging and the completely blind minifigure packaging (which they <em>seriously</em> better make a loophole for when CMFs switch to cardboard boxes) likely did not do well for sales, sending a pretty dire message. And while I enjoyed the figures, most would have been better in CMF series without restrictive music theming and with higher production budgets. Vidiyo may have deprived those character concepts of an optimal execution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vidiyo was <em>so</em> over after its beginning that Bandmates Series 2 apparently never saw the light of day in the U.S. That was a shame because there were figures I liked, and none more than this guy, introducing a new type of monster character to LEGO. I did the sensible thing and got the figure sans accessories through BrickLink because they&#39;re inessential, so this review won&#39;t be as objective concerning the set...but I think it&#39;s negligible here.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>The Slime Singer is a really neat concept, being a humanoid pile of ooze and jelly. We&#39;ve never seen a minifig blob-creature before and he&#39;s reminiscent of the cinematic classic Blob monster or Blobby from the <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> series. The latter aspect made me think he was placed in the Monster Metal genre, but he&#39;s actually classed as an extraterrestrial character in the ETDM genre. Since sci-fi and horror are so often contingent, particularly with The Blob, I think he works for both and he definitely fits in my collection of spooky minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Slime Singer himself is a semi-translucent figure composed of lime green parts and translucent bright green. In photos and renders, the pair of translucent bright green and solid lime looks discordant, and making the translucent parts neon green or the solid parts bright green would&nbsp;seem like the better choices...but in person, the figure looks really fantastic. The reflective translucency and the solid colors bounce off each other really well to make the figure look more textured and dimensional. This is only aided by the fantastic texture printing on the figure, which features slime ripples, white light reflections and subtle metallic sparkles to make him look jelly and detailed.&nbsp;This is the first figure I&#39;ve owned with a translucent leg, and I think a bit more printing would have been warranted to add slime on the side and thicken the colour, but it still looks good. The most interesting thing about the figure is the head. It&#39;s composed of a blank lime&nbsp;green minifig head and a translucent new mask piece that&#39;s very drippy and gooey, extending down onto the torso contours on all edges. The solid head under the mask is a clever way to make the head translucent without showing off the internals that a&nbsp;fully translucent creature head would show.&nbsp;I hope this mask piece isn&#39;t a one-off because it has potential. It&#39;d make a great minifig Clayface in a solid nougat (even allowing him to be de-transformed with a normal head beneath) or&nbsp;make other gooey monsters--melted zombie version of the Ice Cream Saxophonist? The face is printed with some orange&nbsp;ladder shades that work well with the green and a wide wavy mouth with two rounded teeth and stringy drips in green and white going down between the top and bottom. The face feels pretty flashy with the shades, but it doesn&#39;t feel too limiting. Who&#39;s to say slime-men can&#39;t be stylish? I do wish the arms had printing, though, as they feel notably lacking in detail that could tie it together just a little more. The accessories of the figure as sold in the package are a grey boombox and a silver mic, which are simple but appropriate.</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>If you like retro horror or sci-fi, this is a really great figure, debuting a blob monster archetype in minifigure form, and one that&#39;s really visually attractive and uses colour and print well to blend the different colours and transparencies of the plastic. He&#39;s a little goofy, sure, but he&#39;s not far beyond what I&#39;d expect him to be if this character were a CMF.<br />
Vidiyo may have been misguided,&nbsp;mismanaged, and short-lived, but it did have its hits, and this is one of them. Seek him out.</p>
