On Black Friday, they finally reduced the prices considerably as did almost all other retailers by 30-40% off. I ended up paying a more reasonable price in my opinion.</p>

<p>So I have no green thumb, but my wife is the gardener and when she saw me assembling it she remarked it was very lifelike and believable - high praise from someone that is quite picky about her plants and flowers. When on display (thus no display value), it does take up quite a bit of space so keep that in mind. I actually ended up removing some technic panel leaves as it just was too bulky for what little space we have. Like the Art mosaics, showing it off from a distance increases its realism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From a build perspective, it felt really strange as 1 set of bags was poured in soil, 2 big bags were for the octagonal base, 1.5 bags for leaves and half a bag for the actual flower portion. The vase is a really interesting SNOT build. It&#39;s very secure, and you get a lot of those new curved slopes.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a neat build and a nice display model but not at its Canadian MSRP... although it looks better PPP-wise in other currencies.</p>
