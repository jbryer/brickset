"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-18T09:38:48Z","Yeah signs are really great!","I bougt mine many years ago, I think it was the Christmas 1992. I bought it together with the 6668 Recycle Truck and the costed 104 NOK together(about 14$). It was then I saw 7745 in the store; it looked awsome, and I still remeber it(I wish I bought it!). These signs look very cool but you must be careful with them. You can place them anywhere.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-03T17:17:24Z","Yeah, yeah! Signs!","woohoo! SIGNS! How fun! Even though they're European (It took me a while to find out what they mean) and they are quite fragile as the signs snap off the posts(thank the heavens for crazy glue!) they rock!!!

P.S. The $28 sign pack? It's got 3 copies of the newer small clip-sign pack.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-07-14T12:35:20.467Z","Finishing Touch","Built a LEGO city and need to finish off the roads? Look no further. I remember getting this when I was quite young and back then I think these were about $2.99 for the box.

The Box consists of eleven signs which I felt was quite a weird number. You would think either a nice round ten or a dozen but there you go.

The signs you get are European but they translate quite easily: 
2x Stop
No Entry
People Crossing
No Left Turn
Parking Ahead
Construction Ahead
40 Speed Zone
No Overtaking
No Parking
Dangerous Intersection

My only complaint I have with them is that the can become quite weak and snap at either the top near the sign or at the bottom near the base and can be easily bent. I'm quite sure this is not an age thing, but age could be a factor. Not for the younger, rougher children.

Overall not a must have, but nice if you like building roads and towns. I feel this set is a 5/10 or Average, as it isn't a starry set but it is a nice finishing touch. I would pick some up if you see them.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-02-13T17:46:42.89Z","I Have a Great Sign about This","Lego has made some great signs for your Lego town over the past 30 years. If you need signs for your town or you're just looking for the right one, this is a great set to pick up. Overall, this is a must own.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"davidschor","2007-08-04T19:31:22.16Z","Town in need of some signage?","When I put together my first Lego town, it rapidly became clear that there would be a need for some traffic control devices.  After a few attempts at home-made signage, I discovered the Road Signs set.  Perfect addition to any city scape, as they really finish the feel.  How can you have a Lego city without signs?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2009-09-07T11:59:24.53Z","21 years later","I bought this set several hours ago. I'm glad I had chance: one should be greatful for finding such a rare thing like road signs in Lego sets these days. Exception - 8401. 

So You get several signs here, like Stop (here You have 2 of them) or Parking sign, as well as Speed sign and many others. 11 in total. The picture shows it nicely.

I guess it's a really cool addition to any Lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mbova","2018-11-22T01:11:10.903Z","A Sign That This Might Not Be The Set You're Looking For","<p>I was crippling disappointed with this set as a kid.&nbsp; Yes, it was just&nbsp; a pack of street signs (so how much can you really expect?)&nbsp;but its usefulness&nbsp;(and the signs&#39; ability to stay standing on carpet) were both nearly nonexistent.&nbsp; Perhaps if I had been given tracts and tracts of gray LEGO &quot;road&quot; onto which these could have been affixed, things would have been different, but as it stands, I hated this set as&nbsp;a kid.</p>
