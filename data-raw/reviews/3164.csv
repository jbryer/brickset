I used the tall Lego flags to finish the main buildings in my city.  It gives things a very distinguished look.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

All the pieces serve such simple purpose. 

The flags can be particularly useful to highlight either a shop or an official building, and for instance combining two colors on the same mast can generate a town's official flag (although you would end up with only 2 copies of it). The tall flags are less attractive in my opinion, since they cannot be composed.

The round fences suit best when used as separators for queues or protection of the walkways.

The grill fences are much more versatile pieces. They can be used as a regular fence, for one regular house garden or up to three tiny backyard gardens, and the 2 opening fences are a fantastic addition. But they can also be used as windows for storage buildings, or even in vehicle design.

If there is one regret about this set, is that it would have been great to have one or more similar ones with alternate colors (or a larger one with all of them).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
