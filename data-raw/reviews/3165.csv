You can use these trees to create woods or public parks. Think of your  minifigs: at the weekend they need places where they can relax and breathe in fresh air. ;-)

This set is great: two big deciduous trees and two big coniferous tree. There are also four small coniferous trees; a bit too many but you can still create a Christmas tree plantation with them. You also get many flowers, which is a bit of a problem. When you have bought this set several times, you don't know what to do with all the flowers. But if you remove the petals, you can use the rest as grass. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-28T09:06:08.03Z","Very good decorative accessory selection","Trees and flowers are mere town decorations, but they make a difference between a well-designed town and a well-designed town you'd like to live in.

This accessory box has just the right size for its purpose, larger than previous releases, and a quite nice selection of different pieces (although small fruit trees would have make it even better) and different flower colors.

There is no building value here, just decorations. But the selection really looks exact in size and variation.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
