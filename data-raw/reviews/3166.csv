The palm is shorter and less flexible than the one from 1993. Anyway I think the flags are useless and could be replaced with useful trees.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It contains a few white fence pieces, lots of flowers and vines, a few shrubs, a couple of pine trees, a coconut tree, a couple of flags and also a nice rainbow parrot. I'd say you get this if you want your town to be a more asthetically pleasant place to live in.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
