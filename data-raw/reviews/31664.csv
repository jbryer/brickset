The minifigs are great, I wish Monica would have an alt face. The&nbsp;Gladys minifig is a very creative design. A couple of nitpicks I have is there are no bathrooms, no bedrooms for the girl&#39;s/boy&#39;s&nbsp;apartments. I wouldn&#39;t want anything huge, but it would&#39;ve been a nice touch. The chair mechanic is awesome. I wish the set would&#39;ve given 3 doors for the boy&#39;s apartment for the sign that has messages on the doors. Of course you can swap out doors, but it would&#39;ve been nice. I hate stickers. I wish Lego would just print, I would pay more to avoid having to place stickers on sets and just have print versions. This set is a must have for any Lego or Friends fan!</p>
