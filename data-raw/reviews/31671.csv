<p>Both windmills look quite recognisable as windmills despite how few pieces used for each of them, with 15 on the left and 12 on the right.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;sails can spin on both of them because they are both attached to a technic piece, which is always a plus for&nbsp;windmills.</p>

<p>I like the colours used on the left windmill, the brown, beige and dark red for the main building&nbsp;really brings out the white used for the sails on that particular windmill. The left windmill also uses a beige arch piece at the front which is a good way to simulate a door on a set so small.</p>

<p>The colours used on the right windmill is 95% white which fits in with the fact that it&#39;s meant to be a huge metal fan, the other colours it has are a grey&nbsp;Rotor&nbsp;plate, which looks nice next to the white, paired with a beige technic piece (probably used to give it some colour) to make the blades&nbsp;spin,&nbsp;it also has&nbsp;a black lever on top of the pole which is being used as an antenna which gives it a little more depth.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;set also comes with 2 green 2x6 plates connected together with a blue 2x2 plate which you put the windmills on top of as well as 2 plants and 2 yellow flowers to decorate those green plates to give it some colour and depth.</p>

<p>My <strong>Biggest Negative</strong> is that it falls over so easily if you woggle your desk or shelf at all probably due to it being front heavy. Two other negatives I have are that the white shows every piece of dust that falls on it meaning you have to clean it often and the blue 2x2 connecting plate doesn&#39;t fit at all.</p>

<p>In conclusion&nbsp;Wind Energy is decent especially for the price I got it as&nbsp;but has a couple issues. But I&#39;d recommend buying it if you want a tiny vanity set for your desk or shelf or are buying a lego city.</p>
