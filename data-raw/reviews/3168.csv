You can -duh- use the wheels to make cars, but they are also useful for anything which might need to spin or anything like that.  I have found many uses for them.  But really the usual use is on cars, so that is what I will discuss.  You get enough wheels and tires to make 6 cars, two with small wheels and two with big wheels.  I would recommend getting this set if you already have, say, 5130 or something of the like to make cars from.  This set is good for supplying much needed wheels.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros
- Lots of tyres
- Lots of wheels
- Lots of wheel-connector bricks

Cons
- None!

Overall, a great supplementary set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
