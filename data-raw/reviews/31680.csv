"Tuzi","2022-11-10T17:36:03.407Z","An odd assortment of mismatched parts","<p>I got this set for free when I ordered 50+ euros worth of PAB parts.</p>

<p>My first impression of this set was mostly confusion. The parts included are&nbsp;<em>somewhat</em>&nbsp;rare amongst LEGO sets, but what the hell can I use them for? There doesn&#39;t seem to be much of a consistency between the parts, they&#39;re all in wild colours and only a few of them seem to be somewhat useful in my builds.</p>

<p>The following parts stood out to me:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6295184/mini-helmet-no-243"">2 Orange space helmets</a>

	<ul>
		<li>While they&#39;re nice to have, the only visors included in the bag are&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6358269/divers-mask"">bright orange divers masks</a>. That don&#39;t cover the entire helmet.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6229124/mini-hat-no-54"">2 pink cotton candy hats</a>
	<ul>
		<li>These would&#39;ve been useful&nbsp;<em>if only the bag also included pink blank heads.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6341823/mini-head"">2 blank glow in the dark heads</a>
	<ul>
		<li>Neat? I might find a usage for these&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> but I don&#39;t really see much point in them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6308842"">2 pigs</a>
	<ul>
		<li>Probably one of the most exciting parts, <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts?query=pig%201x4x1"">only appearing once every few years.</a>&nbsp;I&#39;ll be using mine for a butcher shop &gt;:)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6273157/brick-2x2-circle-w-cross"">4 transparent fluorescent green 2x2 round bricks</a>
	<ul>
		<li>These make for great radioactive themes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6055385/mini-head-no-1296"">4 &quot;pineapple&quot; heads?</a>
	<ul>
		<li>At least I <em>think </em>they&#39;re pineapples? The bag doesn&#39;t have a part for the green leaves, and the print isn&#39;t wrapped around the entire head. No idea what to use these for.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6309044/fence-1x4x2-w-shaft-no-1"">2 bright red chinese fences</a>
	<ul>
		<li>I happen to be a huge fan of LEGO&#39;s CNY sets, so I was happy to see these, though I wish they added more. Will go great in the Chinatown part of my city.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6323618/flat-tile-1x4"">4 transparent brown opal 1x4 tiles</a>
	<ul>
		<li>I haven&#39;t really seen other parts in this odd colour yet. Neat, I guess? It feels like the colour is too niche for any practical usage.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it feels like the bag is part creator, part &quot;hey look at these odd parts we happen to produce&quot;. There&#39;s really no real theme unlike&nbsp;the previous couple VIP bags. Nice to have, I suppose, but I would never buy this bag on its own.</p>
