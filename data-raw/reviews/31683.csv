Huzzah!&nbsp;However, its part selection is unfortunately inferior to its predecessor, #40515: Pirates and Treasure VIP Add On Pack. Pirates and Treasure seemed complete in its theming leaving no pirate archetype left out, except say a crab and flintlock pistol pieces. Here, there are many missing Halloween elements I would expect to see: the jack-o&#39;-lantern, potion bottle, and orange trick-or-treat bucket seem glaringly absent. A black cat, coffin base &amp; lid pieces, and more parts to dress up minifigs&nbsp;would&#39;ve been appreciated as well. The Spooky VIP&nbsp;Pack seems to realise this, attempting to make up for it by giving you&nbsp;<em>six</em> skeletons versus&nbsp;Pirates and Treasure Pack&#39;s two. (I&#39;m also glad to get more teddy bears, but they seem out of place here.)</p>

<p>Despite all my criticism,&nbsp;Spooky VIP Add On Pack is still a good promo, especially with a spend point of only $50 USD. I&#39;m just a huge lover of the spooky and the scary, and LEGO just seems to neglect it these days. I&#39;m just desperate thus setting my standards overly high!&nbsp;</p>

"exorallan31","2022-10-14T19:31:01.37Z","Great parts pack","<p>This is mainly a parts pack. and oh boy there&#39;s some great stuff here. 6 Skeletons, 4 bats, 2 black chains, some nice black fence parts, wings, spiders, Greay frogs, brooms, hats, Space style guns, teddy bears, cookies, pumpkins, lanterns, wheels, lightning pistols, big web part, and some eyes.</p>

<p>The building experience... there isn&#39;t really a building experience, it&#39;s something to make your own stuff with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>you can make some fun little things here like a carriage, or a plane, or you can modify your sets with the parts to make them more spooky. great fun and play to be had here.</p>

<p>just like the build experience... there is not really value for money. it&#39;s a promotional set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>so overall this is great. just great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought a couple for $10 each CDN which of course was not Free but still an excellent value for My Money!</p>

<p>The Six Skeletons Alone are easily worth that!</p>

<p>All the rest is just bonus!!!</p>

<p>Only thing WAY out of place is the Teddy Bears.</p>

<p>They Do Not Fit In At All!!!</p>

<p>Maybe if they went with Mini Teddy Bear &quot;NO.5&quot; the one that came with the Scary Goth Girl or maybe even&nbsp;Mini Teddy Bear &quot;NO.4&quot; which is &quot;Bobo&quot; Maggie&#39;s Bear from the Simpsons but the one they went with is LAME, has nothing to do with Halloween and the only Mistake LEGO made here with this set. They must have a surplus of them that no one wants maybe? LOL</p>

<p>They do work perfect with any X-mas sets of course.</p>

<p>Anyhoooooooo...</p>

<p>Nuff Said!</p>
