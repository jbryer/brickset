<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">First the figs.&nbsp; You get three characters that are all exclusive to this set: Bro Thor, Korg, and Miek.&nbsp; Bro Thor / Fat Thor shows him without a shirt and with a big belly, whose printing overlaps onto the hips (although the coloring isn&rsquo;t great.)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about the best you can do to showcase a chubby stomach in printed form; I would be tempted to suggest that they&rsquo;d actually make an additional molded piece to create a 3D belly, like the fat-suit that Chris Hemsworth had to actually wear. . . but I guess that would be going a bit far for a humanoid minifig.&nbsp; The head and hairpiece are reused from the other Thor figs in sets this year. Next up is Korg, who is wearing a festive tan skirt with his rocky abs visible beneath it.&nbsp; I think the headphones he comes with are supposed to be because he&rsquo;s a gamer now.&nbsp; His rocky hair piece is exclusive, I believe, and does a good job of recreating this character as a fig.&nbsp; Miek was a bit more abstract of a character, so he only gets a printed minifig head atop a few studs.&nbsp; The flower studs give him some added texture, but he remains quite simple.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The main room is pretty cluttered for a LEGO model but has a lot of fun details hidden around it.&nbsp; Pizza boxes litter the house, you have stuff like a frying pan, a whip, a pitch fork, an ore, and a shovel stashed on the walls.&nbsp; There are seems to be two boat models; one on the shelf above the couch and one above the fireplace.&nbsp; (Maybe they&rsquo;re supposed to resemble something else, but I see them as mini sail boats.)&nbsp; Strangely, there&rsquo;s a barrel next to the fireplace that contains trans yellow tiles.&nbsp; This is obviously supposed to be ale, but I find it kind of weird that alcohol is included in a LEGO set in such a way.&nbsp; Maybe officially it&rsquo;s labelled as lemonade?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The couch is the most interesting build of the bunch, featuring a few SNOT techniques to create the cushions.&nbsp; And then you have a lot of detailed stickers hidden around the model.&nbsp; The TV (nicely placed at an angle) showcases the video game, where Korg seems to be a playable character due-wielding Stormbreaker and Mjolnir.&nbsp; Noobmaster is making some comments on the side, and you even see the stud score at the top of the screen, representing many LEGO video games.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if the number for the score means anything, it&rsquo;s too long for the set number anyway.&nbsp; A newspaper clipping is included talking about the blip, but the best sticker is the photo of Thor, Valkyrie, Korg, and Miek attached to the wall, a nice memento of their previous adventures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Once you&rsquo;ve removed all the clutter, the room itself is extremely basic.&nbsp; The walls use a mixture of different textured bricks to give it a rustic look, and there&rsquo;s a little stove in the corner.&nbsp; A fun bit of the design is cookie tiles and pizza slices are placed on the floor under other items like the couch, showing just how messy Thor has let his place become.&nbsp; The exterior looks remarkably plain, but the door does open to let you in, even if the ale barrel blocks you from entering too far in.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s also a small signpost for New Asgard that&rsquo;s supposed to be set up outside the room.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I think the minifigures are the main draw to this set, and the other pieces don&rsquo;t necessarily excite me.&nbsp; There are a few fun sand green elements in the couch, and the walls used a lot of SNOT and masonry bricks which could be useful.&nbsp; Oh, plus the angled door frame is here, which isn&rsquo;t new but I still believe it&rsquo;s uncommon.&nbsp; The printed pizza tiles and game controllers are also a nice touch.&nbsp; I could&rsquo;ve gone without the treasure chest however; I&rsquo;m not a fan of getting the bottom half but not the top half.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s a solid display piece that captures a lot of nice details from the movie with some easter eggs hidden around.&nbsp; The characters are great, but there&rsquo;s a pretty big lack of action features here, so not really a set for playability.&nbsp; I feel this is probably aimed to an older audience who want to collect the figs, but I&rsquo;m sure any Avengers / Thor fans will appreciate this set for what it is.&nbsp; And honestly, at $29.99 USD, it&rsquo;s on the cheaper end of things too.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t say that this is <i>the set</i> to represent the EndGame movie, but it will do a good job of supplementing your Avenger collection.&nbsp; (And besides, we all needed an Korg fig even if we haven&rsquo;t admitted it to ourselves yet.)</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2022-05-28T14:23:29.897Z","One of the Best Marvel sets Ever","<p>The Infinity Saga is an excellent subtheme that gives us a second chance at getting better and more accurate sets based on older MCU films. A lot of these sets are great, but none caught my attention quite as much as Bro Thor&rsquo;s New Asgard. It&rsquo;s a set based on a scene I never would&rsquo;ve thought Lego would represent, so that alone was a huge draw to the set.</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Thor&rsquo;s House:</b> This build reminds me of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76185-1/Spider-Man-at-the-Sanctum-Workshop"">Spider-Man at the Sanctum Workshop&nbsp;</a>in certain regards, mainly how it&rsquo;s a messy looking location-based set with tons of knickknacks lying around, the difference here though, is that Bro Thor features a much more focused build and handles the messy aspect flawlessly. Nothing comes off as ridiculous or overdone, but rather authentic and faithful to the scene it&rsquo;s depicting. Now, I can&rsquo;t point out every single detail, because otherwise I&rsquo;d be here all day, but some noteworthy ones include the multiple boxes of &ldquo;Storm Baker&rsquo;s Pizza&rdquo;, a barrel (surprisingly containing alcohol, represented by 2 transparent yellow studs), the cookies and empty beer bottles lying around, a newspaper indicating it has been 5 years since the snap, a cute stickered tile of a picture of Thor and his buddies, and of course, the &ldquo;Lego Fortnite&rdquo; TV screen, which looks both hilarious and awesome. The sand green couch could comfortably fit the 3 figures included in the set, and removing it reveals a lost cookie that&rsquo;s fallen under it! I absolutely love little unnecessary details like that. Additional accessories and shelves are present towards the top of the model as well. One more thing to mention is a separate little side build which has a stickered sign that reads &quot;Welcome to New Asgard. Please Drive Slowly&rdquo;, and it complements the main build pretty well. Overall, I&rsquo;m extremely impressed with the magnificent detail packed into such a compact space, everything was executed perfectly, and it came out a beyond excellent display piece.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Bro Thor</b>: This was a figure I wasn&rsquo;t expecting Lego to make, but here it is. I was wondering how Lego would pull off the fat belly, their solution was having the belly print carrying down over to the hip, and it worked out wonderfully. The dark tan legs also feature additional print with a gray plaid design. The face prints include a content smiling face and a &ldquo;charged up&rdquo; lightning eyes face. The hair uses the Aquaman hair in dark tan, and it definitely fits perfectly for him. Finally, his accessories include an empty beer bottle, a slice of pizza, and storm breaker, which has a spot in the house where you could clip it. Overall, a very well-executed and highly collectible figure, very pleased with this one.</p>

<p><b>Korg: </b>Korg&rsquo;s minifigure debut was definitely long-awaited, I&rsquo;ve heard some disappointment that he wasn&rsquo;t represented as a big-fig, but personally, I think the regular minifigure approach was a reasonable one. The plain tan legs is a bit of a letdown but the tan Hawaiian shirt outfit is great, the presence of dual-molded arms is also much appreciated, although I wish there was print on the arm to continue the shirt&rsquo;s pattern. Korg also comes with a headphones neck attachment in dark tan. The face prints capture the character well in my opinion, with a grin and an open smile. The new piece introduced with this figure is the rocky head attachment, I admit, I&rsquo;m not the biggest fan of how it looks, but it still gets the job done. Finally, his accessories include a game controller and a slice of pizza. Overall, some print on the legs and/or arms would&rsquo;ve helped improve the figure, but I&rsquo;m still happy with this exclusive variant of the character. And like Bro Thor, it feels like a very collectible figure.</p>

<p><b>Miek:</b> Similar to Korg, I was wondering how this character would translate to Lego form, the result was&hellip; rather strange. Instead of making a new piece for Miek, he was built out of 3 parts: 2 stacked flower stud pieces in lavender, and a regular printed minifig head piece. It&rsquo;s not terrible by any means, but something just feels off about him. His design seems more serviceable when paired up with his exo-suit&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40525-1/Endgame-Battle"">Endgame Battle</a>, but on its own, it looks a bit weird, perhaps a new mould was warranted for a better-looking and more accurate Miek.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The retail price of R570 feels alright. The build does feel a bit small for the price, but the sheer amount of goodness and premium feel of the build makes it feel justified, at least to a decent extent.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If I had to briefly describe this set, I would call it a comic-con set made widely available. That&rsquo;s what this set feels like to me, a comic-con exclusive set. The way it&rsquo;s presented with the dioramic look and the impressive amount of detail packed into such a small space feels special and unlike any other offerings from the Marvel line. The figures are also very well-detailed and highly collectible. All in all, I love this set and there&#39;s practically nothing wrong with it&nbsp;outside of maybe the strange Miek figure. A must-have for any Marvel fan. Strongly recommend.</p>
