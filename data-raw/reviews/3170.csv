city would look cluttered and unorganized. I got these road plates over 
10 years ago. The road itself is 18 studs wide, and on the outer edge of
 the quarter circle there is a huge grass area where you can build 
houses, skyscrapers, or any building you want. The road is divided into 
two lanes by a solid white line (in Canada and US, this means traffic is
 flowing in the same direction in both lanes and passing is not 
allowed). <br><br>There is a problem today regarding the size of road 
plates. Currently most Lego vehicles are at least 6 studs wide, if not 
more, which means that a modern vehicle will dwarf into the other lane 
if placed on an old road plate. These older road plates were designed 
for smaller 4 stud wide vehicles. Not only this, but newer road plates 
have a completely different design, and the road is two studs wider. 
This means that placing a new and old road plate adjacent to each other 
will look very awkward.<br><br>Overall, these road plates are great but 
they are now obsolete and won't fit nicely with modern City sets. If you
 prefer old road plates over the current ones I suggest going to 
Bricklink to purchase them.",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
