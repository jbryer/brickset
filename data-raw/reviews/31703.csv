Following LEGO&#39;s disappointing first wave in 2019, they followed it up this year with a new wave featuring more spoiler-y moments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This to me, is halfway to a brilliant set. Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p>Sanctuary II coming in midscale makes perfect sense to me and when I had fully constructed it I was very pleased with how it looked, and also with the size. The wingspan of the ship is really quite something. It&#39;s about the same size across as an average 32x32 baseplate - this works perfectly as a display item, even if it&#39;s not exactly Ultimate Collector Series level detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gripes I have with the ship design are ultimately fairly small. The &quot;backdoor&quot; of the ship is two hinge plates which are not properly connected, thus making it feel incomplete from the backside. My other major one is that the cargo port in the back doesn&#39;t have a stud to easily store something without rattling when you &quot;swoosh&quot; it.</p>

<p>The minifigures are superb. Thanos in minifigure scale is great and something that really works for me - having &quot;big fig&quot; villains available in minifigure scale allows for more play and allows for more detail (as well as availability). I would&#39;ve liked an alternate face for Thanos, but can understand why there isn&#39;t, as they do show him without his golden helmet in the promo images of the set.</p>

<p>Iron Man looks good, as always, and it makes sense to me why he&#39;s in this set. I feel however that considering the period in the battle this is based on, he should either have slightly battle-damaged armour, or perhaps a face that is scarred. We&#39;ve seen the same Tony Stark head for a while and adding some slight variation would be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Captain Marvel is an interesting one. In her previous Marvel Cinematic Universe minifigures, she&#39;s been under detailed and hasn&#39;t really captured the likeness of Brie Larson particularly well. Dual-molded legs would&#39;ve been preferable, or at least some arm printing. She&#39;s an amazing character and looking at her suit in Endgame, it deserves some prints on the minifigure&#39;s legs if it isn&#39;t going to be dual-molded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is almost there for me. I feel another minifigure would&#39;ve added heaps to the value - maybe a Nebula considering her importance in the film&#39;s final battle.&nbsp;</p>
