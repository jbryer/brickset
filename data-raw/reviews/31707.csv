I don&#39;t have a huge interest in mechs although I have bought and built a few that were on clearance, and I usually just build and then take apart for parts. I thought this one might be interesting as I&#39;ve never send a mech for a big fig. That said, this set is much better than I thought it would turn out. It definitely has an ALIENS Ripley Powerloader feel to it. It&#39;s nice and chunky so very stable, yet has enough range of movement to get some pretty good &#39;walking&#39; poses out of it. I think I might actually keep this one built for a awhile as I can see shoving a Thanos or Hulk in it would be pretty fun too! It also does a great job appearing like an oversized caricature of Sandy as well. With a small discount, I would recommend it !</p>
