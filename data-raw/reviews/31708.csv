I did, however, order a few figures from the line through LEGO&#39;s Bricks and Pieces, but as far as I was concerned, that was that for me. At least, until I saw pictures of the Bone Demon&#39;s set.</p>

<p>Now, you have to know that I Like demons, I like everything that has a &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; vibe to it, I like &quot;glow in the dark&quot;, so I simply&nbsp;had to have this set&nbsp;in my collection; Monkey Kid or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ordered it on the 1ste of July, got it on the 2nd (good job LEGO) and built it on the 3rd :). I have not yet regretted spending 109&euro; on this set, and I probably never will, although the set is a bit of a mixed bag.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get one thing out of the way first - the rubbish part: the monkey kid&#39;s mech is a big pile of *bleep*.&nbsp;Seriously, it is a complete failure. The build is OK, but nothing to write home about. Once you have build 1 mech, you have somewhat built them all. The color-scheme of red, yellow and flame yellow is consistent (if I forget the few white parts that totally ruin a, what would have otherwise&nbsp;been, perfect output) with the monkey kids pallet.<br />
The problem lies in the abundant use of mixel ball-joints. Especially the one connecting the hips to the waist...oh boy.<br />
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like posability, but this right here is just insane. There are so many joints all over the place that the mech has turned into a flimsy, wobbly, blob of jelly. You simply can&#39;t get it to stay in one pose. It get&#39;s even worse when you attach the staff to his hands. The darn thing is so heavy (and the joints are so loose), that it makes the mech tilt and snap and twist and turn and bend in all kinds of shapes and poses, but...never the ones you want.</p>

<p>Ugh, nope, into the parts bin.</p>

<p>PS.: the cloud he is riding on doesn&#39;t&nbsp;help much: placing the mech&#39;s feet on the designated studs was&nbsp;a task that tested&nbsp;my nerves&nbsp;and patience: I almost tossed the damn thing out of the window! Be gone Satan, Vade retro etc... You guys and girls are warned!</p>

<p>Now luckily, there is also pure genius in this set: the glorious Bone demon.<br />
My sweet lord: the finished and assembled model&nbsp;is impressive, monstrous and beautiful, enormous, sinister, evil, simply put: everything you want from a thing that is called &quot;Bone Demon&quot;. The glow in the&nbsp;dark pieces are fantastic, seeing them light&nbsp;up in the dark, truly creating a skeletal glow: perfect! Just perfect!&nbsp;<br />
There is not all that much posability: the arms move, the head moves, the waist can turn, but that&#39;s about it. Could it be better: sure; is it bad? In no way. It feels enough, and it lets you get some nice poses out of it, that give the impressions of movement and impending danger.</p>

<p>That said, I have to be honest and admit that although the combined model is superb, the separate models are definitely not. The scorpion and gateway are somewhat OK. But the mini spiders and prisoncell-throneroom-thingy are respectively too simply and just plain awkward.</p>

<p>--The gateway is a nice structure, that remains nice, even when the demon is assembled. It leaves you with a miniature structural sidebuild where you can pose your demon spirit figures, so I am OK with that. It has some nice oriental shaping to it, nice texture and griebling. It simply fits.</p>

<p>--The scorpion is big, that&#39;s good, it is sturdy, looks cool, but is lacking&nbsp;in the posability department. You can move the claws, his front legs and a tiny&nbsp;bit of his tail, but nearly not enough to make it a good separate build.<br />
And that is a shame: I know LEGO can make great scorpions (like the one from Pharaoh Quest), but this one simply isn&#39;t. I gave it a pass, because of it&#39;s looks and size, and that counts for something.</p>

<p>--The minispiders are, well, meh. Skip, let&#39;s move on :D</p>

<p>--the prisoncell-throneroom-thingy is, like I said, awkward. You can clearly see that it is a leftover piece with not much use to it.<br />
In that sence the entire set gives me classic space vibes: It feels like one of those large space-ships with lots of things to attach to or de-attach from, but, when doing so, leaves you with a base-structure that looks awkward and weird and doesn&#39;t serve a real purpose.</p>

<p>My advice: keep the demon build and intact. Let&#39;s be honest: it is the real reason why you would want to&nbsp;buy this set. And doing so for this reason will not leave you disappointed. And that&#39;s a promise!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t watch the Monkie Kid series yet, but read about it here and there. Since the first wave came out, that included the awesome #80012 Monkey King Warrior Mech, I watch each new wave of sets very carefully for gems like this one &mdash; The Bone Demon.</p>

<p>The set tries to recreate the fight against Lady Bone Demon and her bone mech, it comes with 3 manuals, each representing a stage of the conflict. In the series the mech evolves each time Monkie Kid tries to kill it with his powers. Lady Bone Demon steals/absorbs these powers and infuses them into her mech, thus it becomes stronger, bigger and a lot more menacing.</p>

<h2>Build and Playability</h2>

<p>The first stage is Monkie Kid and Mei entering the tomb of Lady Bone Demon by passing some sort of entrance that is decorated with ribcages and bones to the sides. It is also guarded by two six-legged spiders, each carrying a cauldron with more bones in it. The twin spiders are well articulated, each leg is hinged on a ball joint and their abdomen glows in the dark. The archway holds a big head-like structure at the top, either at the front or the back.</p>

<p>If Mei and Monkie Kid get past these first minor obstacles, they reach the tomb itself. It&#39;s a massive construct with glowing bones to the left and right. In the center there&#39;s a big vessel, more like a sarcophagus if you will. It holds the spirit of Lady Bone Demon. You get two big vinyl pieces hanging down from above, another six-legged little spidey and two bone spirits that protect the tomb. Little spidey is not as cool as the first two but still offers plenty of ways to position it on top or around the scenery. At this stage MK increases the size of his staff and Mei suits up and uses her gun instead of her sword.</p>

<p>Once Lady Bone Demon is released from her &ldquo;prison&rdquo;, she will summon the mighty bone scorpion, one of the bigger sub-assemblies in this set. It&#39;s very sturdy, yet four of its legs/arms can be articulated. It&#39;s a bit a shame that the tail can&#39;t reach the ground in front of it to sting our heroes but the tip of the tail does have some sort of articulation, which is fine. You will soon understand why it was necessary to make it this stable. The two arms with their big claws are fully articulated and can grab a minifig with ease. Transparent blue chains are used to great effect, you could chain somebody or attach it to anything in order to reenact a scene where the scorpion breaks the chains or rip something apart.</p>

<p>In order to defeat the scorpion, MK uses the power of his staff and transforms it into a small mech (similar to the $10 Marvel mechs), including a huge version of the staff itself. The mech is very detailed and has lots of points of articulation. I especially like the hands, that are formed like big shields. Its legs however sometimes collapse under the weight of the staff. At the mech&#39;s back is a technic pin that can hold the staff and if you think the staff is two heavy or too long, just remove 2-3 segments of it! Fortunately, it also comes with a glider, big enough to hold the mech in place and to allow it to fly. The glider includes two small wings, which can be attached to Mei&#39;s back, allowing her to fly as well. Powered up this way, the scorpion is soon to be history.</p>

<p>This is when Lady Bone Demon uses all of her power to summon The Bone Demon&trade; &mdash; a huge monster that combines all defeated minions into a single monstrous entity.</p>

<p>That means, you actually have to combine the scorpion, the tomb, the spider twins, little spidey and the head from the archway into a Voltron/Megazord-like mech, which always feels great if you ask me.</p>

<p>The scorpion transforms into the base of the mech, the claws will become arms and are attached to the tomb that forms the torso. Little spidey is used for decoration between base and torso and the twin spiders are made into badass shoulder pads. Lady Bone Demon can pilot the mech by standing pretty much inside the head, it kind of wraps around her gently.</p>

<p>The final form of the model is really cool looking and all the glow in the dark pieces are just a bonus, really, but a welcome one. LEGO should include glow in the dark in more sets, it seems that any stiff part can be made in that color, so why not use it in more occasions?</p>

<p>Two big swords are included, you can place one of them in each hand via a technic pin connection. You can rotate the upper body 360&deg; around the hips and the arms are very poseable and stay in place.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The minifigs are great as well. MK in his standard outfit, jacked zipped up, printed legs, nice hair piece. He also wears his headphones again, I wish he still had his teal hoody but nevermind. Mei comes in her battle suit v2, including the helm. Also including is her hair piece, which I appreciate a lot. LEGO should always include the hair piece for any minifig. Next is Lady Bone Demon, she comes with a calm and a very scary looking face expression and a hair piece out of rubber. As legs she uses either a 2x2 dress piece or a smoky... ghost-like piece. Her two henchmen aka bone spirits carry the new hood piece in black and two spiked spear weapons as well as the ghost piece for legs, their arms and heads are also glowing. Just in case you were wondering &mdash; yes, there are two complete minifig skeletons in this set (these do not glow, btw), so you end up actually getting 7 minifigs in total.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Nothing too special, really. It holds the current record for the most glow in the dark pieces in one set, I guess that&#39;s a thing. There are also a lot of white and purple parts as well as bones in any shape or form, so if you are into that, there you go.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This set is really cool, and you get a ton of great stuff for your money. Not only does it look great on display, especially next to Monkey King Warrior Mech, but also the play value is insane. Playing through three stages of a fight, ending in an epic transformation feature and seeing the result is just very satisfying.</p>

<p>The build process is great except applying all the stickers (I don&#39;t think there is a single printed element in this set, except for the minfigs, of course). I think it took me around two hours to build.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly recommend this set to everyone loving mechs that are a combination of several smaller builds and to kids of any age that get so much play time out of the huge number of potential scenarios. I recommend combining it with other sets from the theme, they are all very consistent in color schemes and overall style, as you would expect.</p>
