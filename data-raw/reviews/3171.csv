"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-11-01T17:53:20.64Z","Obsolete for today's cities","<p>Road plates are always a staple in any Lego city. Without them, your city would look cluttered and unorganized. I got these road plates over 10 years ago. The road itself is 18 studs wide, and on each side of the road there is a grass area, 7 studs wide, on which you can build small buildings (unless you want to add another baseplate beside the road). The road is divided into two lanes by a&nbsp;dotted white line (in Canada and US, this means traffic is flowing in the same direction in both lanes and passing is allowed). </p>
<p>There is a problem today regarding the size of road plates. Currently most Lego vehicles are at least 6 studs wide, if not more, which means that a modern vehicle will dwarf into the other lane if placed on an old road plate. These older road plates were designed&nbsp;for smaller 4 stud wide vehicles. Not only this, but newer road plates have a completely different design, and the road is two studs wider. This means that placing a new and old road plate adjacent to each other will look very awkward.</p>
<p>Overall, these road plates are great but they are now obsolete and won't fit nicely with modern City sets. If you prefer old road plates over the current ones I suggest going to <br/>Bricklink to purchase them.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Road Plates are accessories that are must haves for all LEGO AFOLs who enjoy building up and attaching all of their LEGO City/Town sets together. With a bunch of Road Plates you can build anything and everything, you can take your Fire Stations, Police Stations, Gas Stations, Restaurants and even City Corner and merge them to make an impressive display. It's just a pity that you can't buy these retail anymore, although with the prices of regular large plates I shudder to think how much you'd be spending picking up a lot of these to merge your Town into one City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I preferred these ones though because the green on either side of the road meant you could attach sets with green base plates to the sides and expand them, like houses and such to become your side of the road sights.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,5
