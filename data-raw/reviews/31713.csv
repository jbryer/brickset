Any attempt to buy a half-decent set ($100 or more) will net you another one of these. The build is fun, the bricks are unique, and the branded plate on the minifig is great for adverts in city builds.<br />
<br />
This set uses stickers instead of printed parts, so be careful, but none cover two bricks. It&#39;s a great little set, I enjoyed building it.</p>
