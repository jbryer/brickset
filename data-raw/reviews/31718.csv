The looks of the model resembles an actual typewriter, and its playable functions works great.... at least when I first built the set.</p>

<p>Six months since I built this set, there have been some significant issues with the carriage of the Lego typewriter. Most specifically, the carriage does not run smoothly and might get stuck over time when playing with the model. I did a bit of investigation on why it is happening, and I have concluded with a strong reasoning: The gears and suspension work fine, but the wheels and track that support the carriage get worn out over usage of the typewriter. What I observed is that the wheels are scratching the top layer of the tiled 1x6 and 1x8 pieces being used as tracks, and when I change the position of the tiles so that the wheels will run on a smooth surface, the movement of the carriage seemed to have improved slightly.</p>

<p>I also found out that after a while, moving the carriage independently on the tracks, there is a squeaking sound coming from the wheels. Another solution I found was to flip the wheels of the carriage so that the edge that has never touched the surface of the tracks will be doing so. As a result, I found that the carriage moves much better than before.</p>

<p>It is still not perfect, as the carriage slows down around 3 types before it reaches the end; I believe this might be due to the weight of the carriage and the suspension not being strong enough to push it all the way.</p>

<p>Another issue is with the letter that comes with this set. Be careful ripping them out of the booklet and be careful it does not get jammed in the feed roller....</p>

<p>In conclusion, the 21327 typewriter is still an excellent set released in the Lego Ideas line, and even though the carriage has some issues six months after building this set, this issue can be fixed with replacing or repositioning the parts.</p>
