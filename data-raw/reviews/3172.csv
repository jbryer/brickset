I was lucky to buy another copy in the local store today, so now I got two copies! These plates can expand a town very fast, and I am going to buy many curves, straights and T-crosses if I can find them anywhere. Lego Company, why don't you rerelease these good road plates together with the two older types? If you can find this in a store, go and buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Now a days i would recommend risking your life to get them as they are very scarce now and help in both the play and display areas of LEGO. Maybe they will re-release these again and I for 1 will be stocking up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-01T11:08:35.793Z","Too Little Space","I loved roadplates as they expand my city but cross road plates are useless for people like me who like vendors and lots of walking space on either side of the tarmac. There is very little space unlike the Curve Road Plates or the T-Junction Road Plates. Either way, I am sure that a cross road is vital in every town so I keep the score at 3.
