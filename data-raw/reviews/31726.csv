<p>This was my first taste of Lego marvel magazine, as this figure was the reason I intended to get 76168 as I for some reason never before owned a Captain America minifigure and for my first one, I am very impressed.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The helmet was introduced in the atrocious 76123 from 2019 but works great with the side printing, there is also a&nbsp;light nougat superman hair included, his face is determined with a chin strap and another with a grin for the hair piece, the torso is fantastic and has a scaled design with the prominent star in the centre and his legs are just unprinted dark blue. The accessory is the shield in dark grey with fantastic printing.</p>

<p>The build-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build included is a stand for the shield and&nbsp;the hair/helmet it is built on a textured 1x2 dark grey brick, with a modified 1x2 plate to attach the shield, a dark blue 1x2 jumper and a black telescope.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a great figure with pointless build, but the figure alone is worth more than the retail price of &pound;4 to me, so I highly recommend this, also the following marvel magazine looks just as good, War Machine from the 76153 Helicarrier with all appropriate accessories.</p>
