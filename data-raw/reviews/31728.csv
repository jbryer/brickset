I watched Seinfeld growing up, and I get the many Easter eggs early reviewers covered in builds and stickers. The minifigures are compelling, but I still didn&#39;t feel like all of this was enough for me to buy into the idea of these increasingly popular &#39;sitcom&#39; sets.... though perhaps I&#39;m not the target demographic as I&#39;m already an AFOL.</p>

<p>So truth be told, I finally caved and bought this set on sale because it was a good way to easily obtain a lot of the nougat coloured tiles in different 1x sizes and the minifigs. However, as I started building, the set started growing on me more and more. It could have been a real slough with the initial few bags of plates and floor tiles, but they cleverly spread mini-builds and references throughout so that it becomes more manageable and even enjoyable.</p>

<p>Building Jerry&#39;s apartment and all of those made me feel like I was watching the shows again, and like a little kid I would start acting out all of those famous lines and scenes so many of us from that generation know from memory... &quot;Vandelay Industries, Vandelay Industries !!!&quot; This left my 12 year old quite confused - especially at the sight of George&#39;s sticker of him in his undergarments in the kitchen of all places!</p>

<p>Finally, I have to say the way they built the angular walls of the film set, and the kitchen area were really enjoyable. I learned a lot of really interesting and unusual building techniques.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&#39;t go out and buy every sitcom set, I can see the allure of other sitcom sets if you&#39;re an avid fan and they take you to a fun, fuzzy place in your entertainment past.</p>
