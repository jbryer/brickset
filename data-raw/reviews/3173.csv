It was purchased as part of a GIANT yard sale find. I love this little ATV. It reminds me of the motorcycles in the 80's as it is worthy of being side by side with my childhood cycles. It comes with a minifig which is a plus. The parts besides the ATV and fig are kind of silly looking. I am glad that I bought this used and love the ATVs. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I built and loved it and had many adventures with it. I remember driving it over the sink and the siren fell into the drain (the problem was solved quickly). After many years, it became boring and the pieces eventually ended up in random places. And to this day, only the officer remains. The other pieces are probably unused or used for something else. Oh well that's my long and sorry tale for this little set. Now on to the details. You can see all the features from this point alone: a telephone, flashlight and police officer. That's it. Pretty boring. The end. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was my first introduction to the tri-wheeled motorcycle. It was a simple build and offered yet another police officer for my collection of Mini-Figures, but it was a fun little set and you could do a lot with it and a few extra Mini-Figures or small Town sets. Plus it was a cheap set, you can't go wrong with the cheap sets. In a retro Town collection the Chopper Cop is a good addition, even if you already have loads of police officers. I will say this though, it isn't a necessary must have set if you got enough cops to populate your own Police Academy.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,5
"sparticusjoe","2018-01-17T22:19:48.393Z","Chopper, Motorcycle, Trike, same thing, right?","<p>Ah, impulse sets, how I love you. The vast majority of my Lego collection is impulse sets. I&#39;d get an allowance every few weeks for helping out around the house and I&#39;d immediately blow that small bit of spending money on a small Lego set next time we went to Wal Mart. Being a preteen at the time, the whole &quot;saving money to buy a bigger set&quot; thing didn&#39;t really dawn on me, so I wound up with a ton of tiny Lego sets. Lego, fortunately, is one of the few toys on the planet where tiny, cheap sets can be every bit as fun as larger sets, and particularly fortunately, can themselves become larger sets with a large enough accumulation of them due to the fact that every brick is re-usable.</p>

<p>Which brings us to this set. Full disclosure, I have absolutely no idea if I got this version or the other re-released version. I&#39;m assuming this one because it&#39;s the more common of the two, but I don&#39;t have any boxes/bags left 20 years later to actually verify that. For the record as far as I can tell the two sets are completely identical.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>&quot;Chopper Cop&quot;, the title of this set, brings to mind a police officer on a chopper-style motorcycle, the type that those old TV shows hosted by Jesse James would be about with the handles way up high. Those look nothing like this. In fact, motorcycle cops, which you do actually see from time to time depending on locale... also look nothing like this. To my knowledge no police force has ever used a three-wheeled tricycle to patrol, though that must be a sight if they did. However, for reasons people that are bigger Lego historians than myself probably know, Lego pretty much full-stop stopped making two-wheeled motorcycles sometime in the mid nineties and took nearly a decade to get back to building them. I have absolutely no idea why, instead kids growing up when I did got these hideous three-wheeled tricycle things that were always, always, always made up of a pair of pre-fabricated pieces that were good for exactly one function: creating a tricycle.</p>

<p>Honestly, growing up at the time, I thought nothing of it, as it wasn&#39;t until I was well into my 20&#39;s until I actually knew that Lego had *ever* created a two-wheeled motorcycle, so it just was what it was and didn&#39;t really seem odd.</p>

<p>So what about the model, you ask? Well, not much to say, honestly. It&#39;s a three-wheeled police vehicle that resembles nothing known to man and is made almost entirely up of two massive prefabricated pieces that are so specialized you&#39;ll never use them as anything else ever again.</p>

<p>There are some accessories on it, namely a very unrealistic little siren thing that is very high up, a walkie talkie for officer friendly to call in the criminal scum he catches to base with, and another... thing, that I think it supposed to be like a very heavy duty flashlight. There are clip plate bricks on the back to hold them to the model, which is very appreciated. Another small 1x2 plate above the two clip bricks would be nice for stability reasons, but we can&#39;t have everything in this world. Oh, and there&#39;s a rollbar on the back of the trike, because the King of Lego issued a royal decree in 1997 saying we need some form of rollbar on the back of literally every single thing they made for around three years.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>None, as with virtually every set from the era. It&#39;s mostly pre-fabricated with like ten bricks stacked on top of it. Nothing to report here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Pretty lame on this front, sadly. The only even vaguely rare part here is the helmet that says &quot;POLICE&quot; on it, which is pretty cool. The rest are common. If you need a trike this is certainly one way to do it, though why you&#39;d want that is a good question.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Oh, fantastic. When I was a kid I loved this thing. It fits in with all the other &#39;98-ish police sets and is nice to have on your fleet. It looks pretty good on display, and fits with #6464 &quot;Super Rescue Complex&quot; quite well because that set has no police road vehicles included. It looks fine and is displayable. Just a shame it had to be a trike.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Very high simply because it costs almost no money. It was less than the allowance of a relatively poor kid in nowheresville, west Texas to afford in 1998. It&#39;s pretty easy to afford these days, going up on ebay for the usual inflated prices and bricklink for between 3 and 10 dollars. If you want another guy to bolster your police force, it&#39;s a cheap way to do so. If you want a trike for some reason, it&#39;s a cheap way to do it. If you want some generic police gear, it&#39;s a cheap way to do it. So it&#39;s recommended, just don&#39;t expect much.</p>

"JoystickJunkie","2020-06-03T03:16:40.657Z","I dis-like Trike - Lego misunderstands what a motorcycle is yet again","<p>When I think of a chopper cop, I think of a policeman on a big police bike, gleaming with chrome, squarish engine on the back, maybe hiding out near a speed trap, waiting to catch you for doing 61 in a 60 zone.&nbsp; When I think of a chopper itself, I think of a large,&nbsp;heavy motorcycle, handlebars high up, low seat, maybe a bag space or two.&nbsp; What I DON&#39;T think of is a tricycle.</p>

<p>Before I&nbsp;start this review, I have to say this right off the bat:&nbsp; <strong>I really dislike the Lego tricycle</strong>.&nbsp; It&#39;s&nbsp;such a ... lame piece that&nbsp;does nothing for me, doesn&#39;t invigorate the imagination or make me excited to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s unrealistic, overly large, blob-like.&nbsp; As a kid, I had a vague idea that Lego had made a two wheel motorcycle, as it had shown up in the Lego Island PC game and in the catalogues I had looked at, but it seemed like every set I ever got didn&#39;t have it.&nbsp; Years later, I found out they apparently had discontinued it, replacing it with this tricycle&nbsp; and I don&#39;t know why they did that.&nbsp; Maybe the mould wasn&#39;t strong enough, or it broke too often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And as a child, whose main Lego System collection was formed from polybags and impulse buys, I ended up with about four or five of these things.&nbsp; Although the tricycles would be used in my town setups, it was only because I didn&#39;t have an actual Lego motorcycle.&nbsp; So they were good for me, because I had literally no other option.&nbsp; But you, as a collector now, have options.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&nbsp;had this one or 4304-1, because I don&#39;t have any instructions, box, polybag or whatever to confirm this.&nbsp; But let&#39;s assume it&#39;s this one because they&#39;re both exactly the same.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>There is no building whatsoever here, with a massive tricycle piece being the centre of the model.&nbsp; You just attach and stack stuff on top of the tricycle, no building experience or flow.&nbsp; Once complete, you&#39;ve got the big tricycle with some stuff on the back like a handle, two clips to hold something and a pole with a trans-blue round 1x1 to simulate a siren or some kind of light?&nbsp; No police bike I&#39;ve ever see has a light post coming out the back of it.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know why this set has a rollbar/handle on the back of it.&nbsp; If it&#39;s a roll bar, it&#39;s especially weird&nbsp;considering it&#39;s a motorcycle so it seems out of place.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the helmet on the minifigure which is emblazoned with &quot;POLICE&quot; or the trans-blue round 1x1, there&#39;s very little in the way of cool parts.&nbsp; You get some clips, a black plate, translucent pieces in red and yellow to simulate headlights.&nbsp; All of this is attached to the main piece of the tricycle.&nbsp; The tricycle is a part, sure, but as we&#39;ve already discussed it&#39;s massive, blobby and lacks versatility.</p>

<p>You know, I said earlier that I don&#39;t hate this piece but I&#39;ve changed my mind in the course of writing this.&nbsp; This piece is really awful.&nbsp;It&#39;s unrealistic and it&nbsp;can&#39;t be used for anything else.&nbsp; It can only ever be a tricycle in this form, which would only be good if you needed to make Billy Connelly to&nbsp;drive into your town and do some stand up.&nbsp; You can&#39;t even replace the wheels on the front and back, as it won&#39;t have enough ground clearance.&nbsp; Why would cops even drive tricycles?&nbsp; They don&#39;t even take advantage of the extra space it gives them to, say, add another cop or something on the back, just a boring old siren and light</p>

<p><strong>Playability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As a kid, I don&#39;t think I used this much for &#39;cops and robbers&#39; or any sort of cop stories.&nbsp; I&#39;d usually turn it into a little mobile gun platform for alien battles with my UFO sets, or a bike to drive supplies around on as I&#39;d attach a mailbox/storage container on the back to act as a courier service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, I&#39;ll admit that there&#39;s story potential here.&nbsp; A lone cop on a bike has some great story possibilities, and of course kids will drive it around, fly it around and at least Lego put some studs on the motorcycle so you could add things like rockets, rotors, or even with some creative construction add a whole structure on the back there.&nbsp; So the tricycle can be used, it&#39;s just so limiting.</p>

<p>Style wise, it fits in with the other late 90&#39;s Town Jr Police sets and compliments them in shape and colour.&nbsp; You can pair this with the 6332/6636 Central Post Command to make a good police force, so it&#39;s a massable sort of thing to have.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>This set usually goes for dirt cheap on eBay and Bricklink, although &#39;retro&#39; and &#39;vintage&#39; inflation will probably start to rear its head regarding these sets.&nbsp; I got&nbsp;three of them in a bulk lot for less than $2 Australian dollars each.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think you should be paying much for this set, given it&#39;s a grand total of 17 pieces.&nbsp; I think, at most, it&#39;s worth $4 dollars, and I&#39;d rather just get the minifigure and leave the trike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>The police officer and the trike certainly saw use in my childhood Lego displays, but the question do you, as a Lego collector or buyer in 2020, need this set?&nbsp; I don&#39;t think so.&nbsp; I suppose the tricycle could see some use in a stunt rally or offroad sort of display but other than that, I think this set doesn&#39;t have much value to a collector now.</p>

<p>If you need a tricycle, this is a good way to get one and some extra stuff thrown in.&nbsp; But&nbsp;if&nbsp;you need a police officer for your police force, I&#39;d say to just buy a minifigure or two on Bricklink.&nbsp; This was a cheap impulse buy in the Town Jr line from the 1990s, with not a lot to offer the modern day buyer.</p>
