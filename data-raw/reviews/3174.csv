"bmwlego","2007-12-26T14:51:35.7Z","Package Pick-Up (I am glad to see that LEGO is still making cargo/delivery service sets)","It seems as if my original review of this set is too harsh so I toned it down a bit.
This could have been so much better. The vehicle in this set is nothing more than the 1 part chassis and a few bricks. The bricks that do make up the vehicle are great bricks however because they are printed. I love the little delivery service logo. The minifig is great as is his hand cart, package, keyboard and container brick on the rear of the truck. Would it have been too much to ask for a roof? When looking at the new for '08 Mail Van 7731, this set pales in comparison. No doors, no roof, too simple of a design. It does have printed bricks however which the new set does not (stickers instead of printed bricks). Anyway, this is an example of a great idea for a town set missing the mark.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 28 pieces and it was 4.75 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio was 17 cents per piece which is really worth the money for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figure has a nice green overall with white arms, a green cap and black shades. It's a really nice figure to have for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.<br></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Wipipi","2017-06-15T23:49:43.367Z","Delivery!","<p>I bought this set in a store, sealed. When I came home, I built it, and I was not disappointed! Although this set is from the dark ages from Lego, and looks more like the driver tried to make a monster truck/muscle car but failed miserably, it still is great fun to play with! Now here are the pros and cons.</p>

<p><b>-Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fun to play with and easy for kids to build!</li>
	<li>Comes with nice printed pieces. 7 to be exact!</li>
	<li>Comes with a lot of specialized parts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Most may not like how simplified the car is.</li>
	<li>There is barely any room to put the things like the computer, and it usually falls out.</li>
	<li>The build is more like a triangle at the front, and has wheels that stick out like a sore thumb.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I think it&#39;s mostly for the kids who want to have some quick fun. Although it can be great for any town because it is a vintage set and it is very important for the common good of said town! 6/10!</p>

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-08T19:24:36.99Z","An impulse set done right.","<p>Continuing on my quest to review the sets I recently uncovered from my childhood all those years ago is set 6325, Package Delivery. I found this along with a ton of other late nineties town sets while cleaning out an attic recently and decided I&#39;d build them up and take them for a spin. To my surprise, it turns out I had not one or two but three of these little sets, and that&#39;s for pretty good reason: This set is fantastic for what it is.</p>

<p><strong>The Model</strong>: Does it look a huge amount like a package delivery car? Well, sort of. It has no roof, as most cars from the era mysteriously don&#39;t, but other than that it does remind me of the pickups that I&#39;d see around my extremely rural neck of the woods to deliver equipment. A van would have been more realistic for what they were going for, because then you could pretend it was a FedEx/UPS truck, but for what it is it is well done. It wasn&#39;t particularly hard for ten year old me to imagine this truck as a pickup that delivered packages to people. This is what I like most about this set and sets like it: It models something that I actually saw quite a bit as a kid. I can&#39;t say I ever really saw a, say, semi truck transporting a helicopter, or a fireboat, or the like in my day to day life in the middle of nowhere, but I certainly saw lots of pickup trucks carrying goods<strong>. </strong>When you couple this truck with the Cargo Center set, it actually looks good with it and is probably why I had three of them, to make a little fleet of delivery trucks for the main cargo center.</p>

<p>The minifigure that comes with it is great also. Lego has had a long history of adamantly refusing to release a post office set (outside of the super rare/expensive two made in the eighties) so little me with my little Lego town I had in my room just made the Cargo Center the post office and this little pickup its delivery vehicles, so this guy was one of my mail delivery guys.</p>

<p>If I had to complain about something with the model, it&#39;s that the package only kind of sort of actually fits in the truck. It does fit, but it doesn&#39;t actually snap in place; the flap in the front of the delivery box prevents it from interfacing properly with the studs. That&#39;s super easily fixed with a generic flat 2x2 plate in the back so not a huge deal.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>I&#39;m giving it a three in this category mostly because it&#39;s a four dollar-ish impulse set with twenty six parts to there isn&#39;t like a ton of interesting things to do building it by default, however, there is one actually really cool and creative thing: The dolly/handcart holder on the back. Using a 2x1 gray plate with the hinge modification on it you can actually put the hinge piece inside the slats in the dolly, which I&#39;m sure ten year old me thought nothing of but old man me thinks is extremely clever. I&#39;m a huge fan of when Lego gives you a place to actually <em>put</em> the many accessories for minifigs that sets come with (looks better for display purposes than just having a million hand tools laying around cluttering the scene), and Lego did a great job giving you somewhere to put this rather large and totally studless hand tool. Never would have thought of that, though maybe some other geniuses out there are reading this and going &quot;duh, sparticusjoe, who <em>doesn&#39;t</em> use a hinge piece to hold onto a dolly&quot; in which case I apologize for being out of the Lego game for the better part of twenty years. ;)</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Super strong in the parts department, this one, considering how few parts there actually are. You get the package box which you can never have too many of, the sort of rare dolly piece, a (admittedly juniorized but still useful) yellow grill, and most interestingly the two 3x1 bricks with a printed Cargo logo on them, which I&#39;m not positive but I don&#39;t think are in any other set than this. The minifigure torso also only appears in this set and the Cargo Center set, so it&#39;s pretty rare too. Also you get both pieces to build a computer, neither of which are exactly common, which makes the set worth the price of admission alone.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Again, I&#39;m an old curmudgeon now, so I don&#39;t really *play* with sets so much as I just *display* the sets these days, but I know for a fact that the younger me had a blast with this set. All sorts of adventures your cargo-delivering friend there can get up to, and if you&#39;re just displaying it there&#39;s a ton of neat poses and scenes you can have him in and look cool on a shelf. More accessories or another box to deliver (or just a place for him to put the walkie talkie when he&#39;s not using it) would&#39;ve made this rating jump to a five.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money: </strong>Considering how little it cost vs. how many neat parts there are I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite high. That said these days it&#39;s one of those sets that for some reason only seems to exist in the Netherlands, at least on bricklink, with the high shipping costs, agonizingly long wait for PayPal to clear &quot;e-checks&quot;, and ten-fifteen day wait time to import it that comes with that. If you can get one for cheap, definitely snatch it up, it&#39;s a great addition to a lego city if you&#39;re not a stickler for extreme realism as most kids probably aren&#39;t. If you are a stickler for extreme realism... This set only needs maybe ten more parts to actually look like a pretty solid delivery van, so there&#39;s that.</p>
