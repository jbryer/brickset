Police
Fire department
Regular people

The set is good for adding minifigures to your town, and the minifigures in question are good for all your town's services and streets. Goes well with Fire Chief and Construction Crew.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2007-08-19T13:44:22.19Z","Excellent figure pack.","What? A great Town Jr. set? Well, as a matter of fact this is a great set, and it could fit in perfectly with the early 1990's sets. Sure, it has 3 generic worker figures, but it also has a nice banker, a female cheif, and a good woman figure. Plus, it has lots of great acessories like a bike, cat, coins, breifcase, and even a pizza! So, this overall is a great expansion to any town, and might just be worth picking up new or used for a few dollars. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Six people-extras like the cat and the bike, at the time it was $6.00, it was and is a great value and a needed addition to any LEGO town. LEGO would due well to re-release this set or one simular at a reasonable price. This set is a must have, great way to add everyday people to your town - 5 out 5 no doubt.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-12T22:12:12.747Z","A Great Addition, can't miss it.","I think I was 5 when I got this. Everything can be seen just by looking at the box: Contrustruction worker with jack hammer, chef with pan and PIZZA, female civilian with bike, fire chief with axe, police with phone, banker with briefcase and COINS, and cat. This is the absolute perfect start the the building of any city. Minifigures have high variety, they come with accessories. What more could be perfect?!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T11:53:18.693Z","Here Kitty, Kitty","<p>Set #6326 Town Folks: Why did I ever let this one go? I mean Mini-Figures don't take up that much storage space... Oh well. It's gone now and there's nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Town Folks is another Mini-Figure Collection from the Town Theme, this one includes a Firefighter, a Police Officer (as though we'd need more of them.) a female cyclist with a red bycicle, a construction worker with jackhammer, a bank security guard with suitcase and coins, a female pizza chef and a small white cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a definite set to pick up for LEGO Town enthusiasts, the female chef and the bank security guard alone are worth the price of this set. LEGO hasn't made that many banks for LEGO Town/City. The cat is a nice touch too, an animal deserving of being owned. The bike is a nice piece that you don't see too often in modern LEGO City sets, and the jackhammer accessory for the Construction Worker is also a unique piece. If you can find this anywhere I'd say get it, I personally should not have let it slip through my fingers, but that is the way of things.</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5

 on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 17 cents per

"Wipipi","2017-06-15T20:17:16.53Z","Great for filling up any Classic Towns!","<p>This Lego Set is an amazing way to fill up your town with every day citizens! If you get all the citizen packs, such as some of the ones from the 80&#39;s, your town will be booming with life! From a construction worker to a biker, children can have a lot of fun with all the characters, from making them have a normal life to writing them a back story, kids can have many different ways to discover a play style that fits them!</p>

<p>Now here are some pros and cons.</p>

<p><strong>-Pros</strong></p>

<p>-Easy to fill your town with life!</p>

<p>-Have simple townsfolk that you can easily build in about 5 minutes!</p>

<p><strong>-Cons</strong></p>

<p>-No builds. If a child doesn&#39;t have anywhere to put them, such as a base plate, they could get easily lost.</p>

<p>-No where to put the bankers money! This is probably my biggest complaint, since I have to just put his money on the floor. This actually resulted me in losing one of his coins somewhere on a shelf while I was relocating the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a great set if you are looking to add to a town, specifically a vintage town. It just gives it a more &quot;alive&quot; effect. I am looking forward to getting more sets like this to fill up my classic town!<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
