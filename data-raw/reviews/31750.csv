"gensao","2021-07-08T08:38:29.82Z","A good value","<p>This set is a <a href=""https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/498153942"">Walmart</a> exclusive. It has retail&nbsp;value&nbsp;of $45 USD and was purchased at the ongoing discounted price of $25 ($0.041/piece).&nbsp; The purchase qualified for a&nbsp;free <a href=""https://walmart-lego-masters-gwp.webflow.io/"">LEGO Masters storage playmat</a> with $40 purchase.&nbsp; I ordered a separate LEGO set to qualify for the promotion.</p>

<p>The set included&nbsp;four sets in their original retail boxes (a&nbsp;big box with four smaller boxes)&nbsp;and a LEGO storage bag.&nbsp; The bag is&nbsp;14&quot; x 17&quot; and can be used as a lightweight backpack (has two straps).&nbsp; Not shown on the retail image is a rectangular 2&quot; x 1.5&quot; mesh opening on one side.&nbsp; This is likely a safety feature and provides a quick peak inside the bag when closed.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;Classic Bricks and Lights set retails for $30 and (at the time of review) can be purchased at <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Classic-Bricks-Lights-11009/dp/B01LZTYP12/"">Amazon</a> for $23.&nbsp; It is like getting 11009 and getting a ton of freebies.&nbsp; A very good value.</p>

<p>My son and I had fun using the included light bricks with the LightBrick Shadow Caster for shadow play.&nbsp; There are 12 shadow models to make and the extra pieces can provide creative opportunities for shadow play.</p>
