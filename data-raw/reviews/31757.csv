This set was rejected by LEGO for an official release. Was there a specific reason to do so or was the plan for 31120 Medieval Castle interfering? We know that 21322 Pirates of the Barracuda Bay was released a year before the Creator pirate ship, so similarities should not be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Another issue could simply could lie in the build itself. There is a distinct level of complexity to the build which would mark this as an 18+ set while the preference may have been to have an easier build. 31120 shares some similarities, but is much more a piecemeal construct with some nice techniques but no more. Maybe it was the digital instruction but the build experience of the central building was disjointed for large sections, adding various parts at the same time without much focus. Perhaps this is part of the review process. The build needs to be broken up in sufficient distinct sections to create a good building flow where you can stop at certain points. I would not be surprised if an Ideas applicant does not take that into consideration and simply builds the best thing he can. This may make it impossible for LEGO to maintain the design to make the build experience work. I had no problem with the complexity of the build and enjoyed the unusual choices but that is also a bit of the charm when building something that is not an official LEGO model.</p>

<p>Part of the build complexity is also the design. The model is highly irregular and the build is full with odd elements to give it a worn feeling and something which has stood in a forest for centuries. LEGO usually keeps such details to a minimum so they are not dominant. The design is often quite sturdy and solid. That is not the case here. There are various fragile sections which easily can fall apart by accident. Some sections are purely there for aesthetics to give the design a unique shape. The two sections on the side are positioned at an angle and while it works fine, there are some gaps. I loved how it came together but also realised that you wouldn&#39;t see such things in a regular LEGO model normally. There are some very interesting but unusual sections. They are all valid LEGO constructs but I think LEGO would make changes or different choices. The result might be that the changes needed to make it work according to LEGO&#39;s standards would have caused major changes. That said, 21322 Pirates of the Barracuda Bay was also extensively modified while keeping the original concept, and it lost little because of it.</p>

<p>One last thought was about the popularity of this set. 10.000 sets were ordered in less than half an hour. Compared to the other crowdfunded sets none came close. While this was an original creation the set did undergo an extensive review process. LEGO would support and produce it, so it needed to hold up to a minimum standard of quality. What I did notice was that the designer used the time to apply for the rules LEGO set to use new parts introduced in the last few years to make some changes.</p>

<p>This is clearly quite different from a regular set with much more detail and interesting design elements, while it also contains a lot of play value with various hidden details. There is a nice selection of minifigs beyond the standard set of soldiers and knights. There is a smuggler, a farmer (of a sort, given it&#39;s set in a forest) and two young forest fighters. The question is only to whom the castle belongs. There is a black falcon soldier and knight, but are they a threat or the owners? The ambiguity leaves plenty different kinds of soldiers to tell.</p>

<p>So to answer the question in the title of this review, it would be &quot;yes&quot;. The only thing like an adult castle set has been this year&#39;s 21325 Medieval Blacksmith and this set takes it a step further. However, you do notice some minor flaws when building the set that remind you that it&#39;s not an official set and it might have been quite different if it had been approved. Now we have been given a version very close to the original Idea and that certainly makes it a rarity and desirable.</p>
