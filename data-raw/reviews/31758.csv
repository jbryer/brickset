Bricklink is, of course, owned b the LEGO Group, and the release and distribution of these sets has largely been handled by LEGO themselves. However, the designs of the sets are largely untouched from their original submissions on LEGO Ideas, and the requirements for release are far less stringent. This does have its benefits (more on that later), but the lack of tight quality control is keenly felt during the build of the Great Fishing Boat. Designers have the option to create their own instructions, which appears to be the case in #910010. This is by no means an easy task, and mistakes can slip in with relative ease, and does so on a few occasions in the digital instructions here. This happens at no detriment to the actual order of construction, and mostly concerns the points at which a new numbered bag is opened, but it does stunt the build process somewhat.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">That is not to say that the build for the Fishing Boat is a chore, although it certainly presents some challenges. The inner core &nbsp;and upper deck of the boat are made using fairly conventional studs-up techniques, while the hull uses clips and technic joints to achieve its curved shape. While at points fiddly, this is undoubtedly the most satisfying part of the build process (closely followed by the details added at the very end of the build), with the purpose of various connection points in the ship&rsquo;s belly revealed as the curved sections are attached. This is not a build to be rushed &ndash; both to enjoy how the shaping is achieved, and to make sure you haven&rsquo;t missed any steps. <b>5/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The figures: </b>a modest crew of three accompanies the fishing boat, which came as a slight surprise to me since the front of the box only shows two! A captain is joined by two fishermen/workers, along with a host of marine life (two crabs, half a dozen fish and, er, some seaweed). All three minifigures re-use existing prints, presumably so as to have minimal effect on LEGO&rsquo;s production capacity. The captain uses the torso present in #60285 Sports Car, which while perhaps bland is a reasonably sound choice. Both workers appear to have misplaced their usual attire, however, as they have to make do with a torso used for the firemen and women of LEGO City (complete with the fire department logo on the back). This choice of torso is otherwise very typical of the high-visibility jackets that might be worn on fishing boats such as this, though, so in the absence of new prints this would seem to be the next best option. The effect is convincing, and in fairness you do need to look pretty closely to see the logo on the back&hellip; <b>8/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Play value:</b> although the Great Fishing Boat might seem more like an accurate model than a playset, some play features have been included. Two cranes are present above deck, allowing the crab net &nbsp;and pair of crates to be moved around and lifted to and from the sea or a potential dock. The anchor towards the front of the ship can be lowered (easily) and raised (less easily, although doable), so with the inclusion of fishing rods and sea creatures it is possible to recreate an entire fishing sortie with relative ease. If you want to do so on rougher seas you can do so as well &ndash; the ship is very sturdy thanks to the construction of the central core, and it is surprisingly easy to handle by cradling the middle of the hull. &nbsp;The roof of the cabin can also be lifted to access the ship&rsquo;s controls, as well as two smaller boxes of snacks &ndash; although two cookies and a quarter slice of pie may not feed the crew for very long! While building it appeared as though the cabin itself would also be easily removable to give access to the sleeping quarters, as it is connected in a similar manner to the roof; however the addition of the stays at the end of the build makes such an endeavour rather tedious and destructive, so play is perhaps not the intended purpose of this feature after all.<b> 7/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Model value:</b> one of the big selling points of the Designer Program is that thanks to the usually minor changes relative to their respective original submissions, owning is effectively the same as owning a MOC by another designer, with the high levels of detail and unusual techniques that may not be expected from most LEGO sets. #910010 is a great example of this, as the completed model looks absolutely stunning. The colour palette is perfectly balanced to give a realistic yet eye-catching look to the boat, further elevated by the small details present on the deck. The tyres hanging off the side are a particular highlight, and the details on the cabin roof are instantly recognisable to anyone who has been on any type of sea-going vessel. Perhaps the most important detail, however, is the stays that stretch between the two masts and down to the hull. While you may need to remove them to access the living quarters, they add so much character and realism to the Fishing Boat that you won&rsquo;t want to take them off at all. All these details are complemented by a hull that, despite the inevitable gaps caused by the right-angle-happy medium of LEGO, is superbly shaped, particularly toward the bow of the ship. <b>10/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict:</b> it would be easy at this point to say that such an excellent model is let down by a build process which is at times frustrating. It is certainly true that a little more QC would have benefitted this set &ndash; as well as the occasionally challenging instructions, my copy of the set had inexplicably had one of the white 1x2 plates swapped for the same piece on light purple, a colour which is not used anywhere else in the set. However context is everything, and at the end of the day this is essentially a MOC whose only practical connection to the LEGO group is the pieces coming fresh out of the factory. Taking this into account, and comparing it the standards of other MOC kits on the market, it is hard to see this as anything other than a successful kit. There are areas where the build can be improved &ndash; but once it&rsquo;s built and looking as good as it does, you won&rsquo;t care one jot.<b> 8/10</b></p>
