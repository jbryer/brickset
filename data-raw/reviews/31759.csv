"Aggie0815","2021-12-28T02:14:47.63Z","A true, ingenious IDEAS set ","<p>Out of the first round of the Bricklink Designer Program (BDP) this was the set I was most curious about.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 4/5</strong><br />
Could have been an easy 5/5, as it is a really nice set to display on your desk or on your shelves. However, the excessive use of stickers - particularly the one for the numbers, that needs to be aligned properly around the dial and the 3 stickers that make up the &#39;Wanted&#39; poster - lead to a downgrade.&nbsp;<br />
A very noticeable and - IMHO - positive development is the fact that there is no printed instruction manual and that the box is not oversized. It is just large enough to comfortably fit the bags with the parts - numbered 1-4 - and a leaflet on how to get the LEGO building app. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience 5/5</strong><br />
While most of the build is straight forward and without difficulties, building the locking mechanism and thus seeing and understanding how it works warrants the full score.<br />
There are a few steps where it is necessary to pay close attention which part is needed: The typical &#39;colour-coding&#39;, that LEGO uses in &#39;regular&#39; sets for similar parts, has not been applied here. For example, a &#39;1x1 brick&#39; and a &#39;1x1 brick with 1 stud on the side&#39; in the same colour are used such that it is not immediately obvious, which goes where. However, as the model is not that big, a mistake is noticed soon and can be remedied quickly. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5/5</strong><br />
The design of the locking mechanism is just brilliant in its simplicity and showcases the creative usage of available (technic) parts. Other than that there is a bunch of tiles in light and dark bluish gray in different sizes up to 6x6 and other standard bricks and plates that can be useful if you decide to use them for some other build. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability 3/5</strong><br />
I find it hard to give a fair rating here, thus, I decided to go for the middle. The set is a great display piece and the possibility to choose your own combination allows for great customization. Seeing how the locking mechanism works is fun. On the other hand, opening and closing the door is the only &#39;play&#39; feature, which for me does not count as true playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money 5/5 or 1/5</strong><br />
For the official price (44.99&euro; in Germany) this set is excellent value for the money, which would give it a rating of 5/5.<br />
However, as the set is not available at MSRP/RRP anymore, it can only be bought on the secondary market starting at around 100&euro; or more, which is - at least in my opinion - highly overpriced, leading to a rating of 1/5.<br />
(Disclaimer: at the time of this writing, I have not seen a part list yet, so I do not know how much a re-brick will cost. The hardest parts to come by will likely be the stickers, as the instructions are available as PDF on bricklink.)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
The Sheriff&#39;s Safe is a great idea that has been excellently executed in LEGO.<br />
Despite the down-rating due to the stickers, this is a great set and I am happy that I managed to get one during the initial offering. While it is not the biggest or most impressive set, I never understood why the safe had not been selected as an Ideas set in first place. It is a prime example for my understanding of the IDEAS program, something unusal that is not immediately associated with typical LEGO builds.<br />
If it was still available directly through the BDP, I would highly recommend getting it. Apart from that, download the instructions and use the locking mechanism for your own MOC&#39;ed or MOD&#39;ed safe.</p>
