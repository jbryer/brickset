You get a winner's stand, SUV, trike, trailer, and two minifigures. You can have a lot of fun with this set and is likely to be rereleased in the future which is unlikely for a set in that era. 5 out of 5 for a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has 3 instructions and both have 2 pages. There're no mistakes in each instruction.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 48 pieces and it was 10 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 21 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has two minifigs. The first driver has a blue overall and a red cap. The other figure has a red overall, a blue helmet and black shades on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-10T06:53:24.037Z","A wholly unnecessary set that also isn't terrible at all.","<p>Next off on my quest to review all the 90&#39;s Town Jr.-ish sets I found in my attic is 6327: Turbo Champs. This set is... odd, to say the least. If you consider it an expansion set to the Super Cycle Center Town Jr. set, it&#39;s actually quite nice and good, if totally unneeded. If you consider it as a set on its own merits, it&#39;s pretty lacking. As ever, the instructions divide this set up into three parts, so I&#39;ll review each part.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Truck</strong>: This is exactly, to the letter, no joke, as bog standard as a late 90&#39;s Town Jr. vehicle can get. There is nothing better nor worse about it than the huge amount of other trucks released in the time period as far as design goes. The decorations are pretty &quot;rad&quot;, as kids would say, but as far as design goes? Premade chassis? Check. Windshield? Check. Fence-brick being used as a rollbar? Check. Printed grill? You know it. Roof? Do you have to ask? It&#39;s Lego Town in 1998, roofs only come about once every four sets or so and this isn&#39;t that once. This truck does extremely little to stand out among all the other nearly identical trucks, so it&#39;s neither bad nor good. In terms of design it&#39;s the &quot;Package Pick-Up&quot; Cargo Delivery truck that I like so much but with a hitch on the back instead of a hinge, and more gaudy paintwork.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Trailer: </strong>This trailer is also EXACTLY like the one featured in Super Cycle Center, but this one has a printed tile brick that says &quot;Turbo&quot; on it. There is an almost 1:1 copy of it in Super Cycle Center, right down to the red 1x4 plate above the wheel assembly. This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, as the trailer design in question actually works quite well for its intended purpose, which is towing a trike. The Trike actually does stay on it quite well, so props for that. Still just interesting Lego didn&#39;t change a single thing about the design of this trailer from what it was in the cycle center set.</p>

<p><strong>3. Trike/Extras: </strong>Man, you&#39;ve seen one three-wheeled tricycle motorcycle and you&#39;ve seen them all, huh? It&#39;s the trike piece that we&#39;ve all learned to know and tolerate (and mostly just wish the old-style two wheel motorcycles were still made instead) with two headlights and a rollbar thing on the back of it. On a side note, despite being a country boy myself who sees tons of motorcycles going by on the highway on a daily basis... I think I&#39;ve seen maybe three motor trikes. In twenty years. They sure are common in Legoland though. Just an observation.</p>

<p>The podium however is really cool. The pieces are printed (as almost but not quite all pieces were on Town Jr. sets, say what you want about the dubious quality of them but man are printed pieces cool), it looks appropriately like a podium, and the gold cup is just a semi exhaust stack brick but gold... which actually works quite nice and works great.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>It&#39;s a 1998 Town Jr. set, which is to say it&#39;s impossible to give it high marks in this category. It&#39;s neither good nor bad, just there. Probably erring more on the bad side because if you own Super Cycle Center, and in order to get any real playability with this set you have to, you&#39;ve already built 2/3rds of the thing in the set. If you own the Package Pick-Up Cargo Truck set... You&#39;ve also already built the other 1/3rd.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Shockingly strong in this category, really. For being as unoriginal as the contents of this set are, there&#39;s a huge amount of exclusive and rare pieces, particularly when you consider this set clocks in at less than 50 pieces. The &quot;TURBO&quot; bricks, while not necessarily something easy to really implement into any other MOC&#39;s or anything, are in fact exclusives, and you get two bricks, a printed tile, and a grill that all say it. Now mind I don&#39;t think they look super good, but rare bricks are always more interesting than generic ones. The podium, while not an exclusive, is very hard to find, and the golden smokestack functioning as a victory cup is also not super easy to find. You can&#39;t tell in the box art but there&#39;s also a 2x2 triangular tile on the trailer that again, while not exclusive by any means, is certainly uncommon. The minifigures included aren&#39;t all that common and both have interesting parts as well. Good parts with this one.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>This is where the set suffers. In order to really get any playability out of this, you basically have to own another set with a trike in it, which in my case was Super Cycle Center, in order to get any meaningful playability out of it. To put it bluntly, there&#39;s nobody for our friend in red the titular Turbo Champ to actually race. It comes with a podium with three places and at best two people to go on it and one bike to actually race with. Congrats, Turbo Champ, you beat yourself in a race.</p>

<p>In order to get much out of playing with this as a kid you pretty much have to own more sets. Probably not the worst deal for Lego&#39;s financial department, and most people probably do own extra sets for the guy to race against, I just can&#39;t shake the feeling that adding a second trike wouldn&#39;t have been that brutal expensive to include considering how many sets have them; then the set would be ready to be played with right out of the box.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you already own Super Cycle Center... You already own three trikes and don&#39;t really need a fourth, making this set rather useless for anything practical except for getting your hands on the podium.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong>: Middling marks here. Ten bucks is a bit steep for as little as comes with this, but what is here is interesting enough and the relentless march of time really hasn&#39;t done much to this set&#39;s prices, easily being found for ten or fewer dollars even in 2017, nearly twenty years after the set was released. There are exclusive pieces in this set which are always welcome, they aren&#39;t the best exclusives on earth, but they&#39;re there. You also get another trike (though most Lego collectors are swimming in the things) and a very cool looking and difficult to find podium. For ten or less than ten dollars? You could do a lot worse.</p>
