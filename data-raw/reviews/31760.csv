I had been disappointed when it failed to make the cut. So when I saw it return for the Bricklink Designer Program it was on the top of my list and I was fortunate to get it for pre-order and see it make the cut this time around.</p>

<p>This is in essence a display set, recreating the Kakapo in great detail on a 1:3 scale. I knew what I was going to get. I also have the 95979 Hedwig, which compensates the little details with dynamic wing shapes. The Kakapo doesn&#39;t fly so it would not need that. Even so, it is nice that the wings can move up and outward. This is a much simpler set.</p>

<p>The build is not overly complicated and I assume few modifications were necessary to pass the review by LEGO for the Designer Program. The main body is a big simple construct of layered bricks with studs on the side while the back is a multitude of cheese slopes. Put on some relaxing music to go with it while the Kakapo gradually comes alive.</p>

<p>Once the body is done the front follows and we get to the most interesting part of the build, which is the head. The base is narrow to set the shape of the head and the beak. The sides of the head is a complex construct of plates and curved slopes. It is a bit fragile and I would imagine LEGO would have made modifications to make it more sturdy had it passed the initial review phase. Nevertheless the result is very good and striking.</p>

<p>The sides of the body are more multitudes of plates, curved slopes and tiles. There is a patchy pattern of colours to break the green which help give the model a natural feeling. The wings were a more enjoyable section to build, even if there were more tiles to add. They rounded off the body and give it substance. While you won&#39;t be changing the position of the wings often as it is a display model they are not attached that sturdy and can easily break off if moved without a gentle hand. This is minor flaw for the little bit of functionality that the model has.</p>

<p>A mini Kakapo is added as a bonus. It is a bit of a flimsy build but once complete it adds its own character.</p>

<p>I knew what I would get with this model and I was not disappointed. With the size comes the details. It has a striking colour and the patchwork elements of additional tan, brown and black enrich it greatly. LEGO has released several large birds of its own in the past few years showing that there is a market and interest for them so it is a pity that the Kakapo was excluded, as it is in style and design not that much different. It may have been its rarity and unfamiliarity which prevented it from becoming a model but the Bricklink Designer Program has allowed it to return and become something unique in the LEGO catalog for the time to come.</p>
