<p>Part 1: The diving scooter:</p>

<p>The diving scooter has a severe lack of curves and has alot of right angles. It has a handle for the&nbsp;figure to ride but is placed to far up front, so it will be a pain to get the figure on. The front has two massive round lights (or cameras) which is strange because as far as I&#39;m aware diving scooters don&#39;t have giant round lights. The side has part of the propellers which is odd because real diving scooters just have one big propeller in the back. The rear has a red 1x2 rounded plate which must represent something. My best guess is that it&#39;s a screen which is why those lights could be cameras but there normally not massive like what&#39;s on the set and part of the tiny propellers.</p>

<p>Part 2: The figure and crab:</p>

<p>The crab is your typical Lego crab except for the fact that this crab can apparently breathe underwater because he is in a diving set. The diver is named Eddie Eager because it&#39;s a Lego magazine, so they give the characters names for the story. Also on some pages he&#39;s called Eagar, but his true name is Eager because his employment contract says so (yes the magazine does include his employment contract this&nbsp;wasn&#39;t a joke). He has red flippers, gunmetal grey legs, gunmetal grey torso with typical scuba printing, a&nbsp;dual face print with one terrified face and a smile and last but least is his helmet, it&#39;s a red motorbike helmet with a light blue snorkel piece.</p>

<p>Pros: comes with a comic.</p>

<p>Cons: crabs don&#39;t belong in the ocean, diving scooter only vaguely resembles real ones and figure is hard to fit on.</p>
