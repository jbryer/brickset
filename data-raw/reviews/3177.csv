It can't make the turns on LEGO roads or go under bridges, arches, or other structures above roads.  The green glass is too dark- you can barely see through it.  The helicopter is not well balanced and the tail is too wide.  I liked the thin tails in older sets better.  The two minifigs are cool, and I like the chrome silver exhaust pipes.  It comes with a megaphone, telephone, and two road barriers.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

This kit manages to take a simple and easy to make concept (a police trailer) and trash it with extreme simplicity and kiddy-ness. But, since all kits deserve a fair look, I must continue with the review.

First, I’ll tackle the 3 different sections of the kit, starting with the helicopter:

Helecopter: Okay, so this isn’t terribly juniorized, but the boom and bottom are one piece each, so I’m not letting it off that easily. Plus, the copter just looks a bit weird. I can’t really put my finger on it, but it just doesn’t look real. Just too kiddy for my liking.

Truck: Ugh, one piece body again! But that’s not the biggest problem. No, the biggest problem is that it’s totally unrealistic! This thing totally disgraces the trucks of the late 80’s and early 90’s. Ugh, kiddy-ness anyone?

Trailer: Hideous. TLC took an assembly that would normally have 50 pieces in it or so, and made it ONE piece. Then they just slapped a few lights and tiles on it and called it a trailer. Thus, we have a super prime example of why Town Jr. is called Junior, and only appeals to Juniors. &gt;_&lt;

Piecewise, this kit doesn’t do any better. Besides a couple of trans-green windshields and trans-blue tiles, there is absolutely nothing special in this kit. However, there is plenty of “specialized,” what with the giant POOPs that they used for the bases of the trailer and truck.

And with only two generic, common Police officers, this kit has nothing to offer minifig wise, either. So, overall, this kit is a complete waste of money and ABS, and I can’t recommend it in the least. No, I HIGHLY discourage anyone who considers buying it. Trust me, it’s not worth it. 1/10",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

However when the set was released it added needed assets to the police force. It is a quick set to put together and doesn't have any unique pieces or bold things to make it stand out. Due to the simple design it blends well with other Police sets released over the past 15 years or so. Not a exciting set but a vauled member of the LEGO Police force.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-12T18:48:13.81Z","Just Not Good","I personally think that Lego could have improved on this set by not juniorizing it but that was Lego in the late 1990s. The minifigs are great and would go in any town but the truck is really lame but the helicopter is OK, but the same colored windshield as the truck is really a bad idea. It just isn't good.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-26T11:41:47.123Z","Town Jr. Ruined LEGO","Yet another example of oversimplified 1990's LEGO. I bought it brand new at a yard sale (even the kid who received it as a gift didn't want it) for 2 bucks. The helicopter almost resembles a halfway decent model. The truck is a complete waste and the trailer is basically 1 large piece. I wonder how a child would rate this set. I guess if the child didn't know what else was out there they might like it but once they see other sets similar to this, I don't think they would rate this too high.
At 15 dollars retail you would definitely feel ripped off. The new Police Mobile Command Unit puts this set to shame but it is 3x the price so you can't really compare the two. I wonder what this set would look like if it was designed and released now. I checked the set info on peeron and was shocked that a set that includes 2 minifigs, a helicpoter, a trailer and a cab only came with 100 pieces! I definitely would never buy these Junior sets at retail if I was into LEGO when they were being produced. It seems like I am not alone as the other bricksetters who reviewed this set gave it a low score as well. Perhaps it is unfair for teens and adults to review a Juniors set.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"peti7788","2022-06-18T11:05:39.707Z","Little more detail would be better","<p>For me, the classic town era lasted until 1996.&nbsp;Then came the horror between 1997 and 2000 called the Town<em> Junior</em>&nbsp;or City Center.&nbsp;The previous more detailed sets were gone, instead we only got a couple of large special pieces and a few bricks for the same price.</p>

<p>It was good for the younger kids because they didn&rsquo;t have to bother much with the building process, and it was also good for the Lego because they could save a lot on it as they were in pretty much financial trouble.</p>

<p>But for the average customer, the 7-12 year old, like me at the time, these sets were useless, only 1 thing could be built from it. There was no alternative model because it consisted of too few and special parts.&nbsp;In fact, in terms of their complexity, these were Duplo sets, with&nbsp;traditional system bricks.</p>

<h3>Big Rig</h3>

<p>Cab</p>

<p>I like the chrome smokestack. A transparent green windshield is also a good choice, so matrix movie style.&nbsp;The roof is easy to remove and fits snugly in the minifigure. I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say 60 seconds is enough to put it together.&nbsp;What I do not like: The chassis is 1 large gray special piece.&nbsp;The headlights are printed. No door.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trailer</p>

<p>At first I thought it was a train car base, but it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;It already has separate axles, unlike a tractor section. And they could have used the train base if they had already saved so much on this set, they wouldn&rsquo;t have had to make a new mold.&nbsp;But they could have been made of some plates&nbsp;and bricks. I don&#39;t have any problems with it, it&#39;s functional.</p>

<h3>Chopper</h3>

<p>I like the shape of the windshield because it makes the cockpit completely closed.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are no playable details on it.&nbsp;No joystick, no searchlight, no engine details. Just marker lights. And 1x2 white printed tile&nbsp;which represents the switchboard.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>The same minifigures are in this set as in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6348-1/Surveillance-Squad"" target=""_blank"">6348</a>.&nbsp;There is one difference in that the helmet visor is transparent green.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I like the color choice.&nbsp;This set, when released, cost a lot.&nbsp;It cost as much as 1 year earlier with sets containing twice as many parts, so it wasn&rsquo;t a good buy.&nbsp;If it had been written on the set box that it was a Town<strong> Junior</strong> set (<em>for the word junior was not written on it, it was a Town themed set anyway</em>)&nbsp;and the price would have been the same as the quantity of parts, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>I rebuilt this set, so I didn&rsquo;t use large special pieces.&nbsp;I think a 4-5 year old kid could build the set in this version as well.</p>

<p>Instead of a large special chassis, there is a 4x12 plate and a 2x10 brick.&nbsp;Plus a 1x2 grid patterned brick.</p>

"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-27T05:46:33.603Z","A disappointing entry in the Town Jr line - ""Junior"" is the operative word here","<p>Town Jr is not an official name Lego gave to any line or sub-theme, but rather is a fan-given name used to apply to a certain era of Town in the late 1990&#39;s where Lego&#39;s builds became oversimplified and juniorised.&nbsp; The sets began to have lots of big pieces to ensure that the building was short and stress-free for younger builders, and that play could start immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I think there is absolutely a space for these kinds of sets and Lego clearly thinks so even now with Lego still releasing the 4+ range of sets and the easy start sets.&nbsp; I have a young cousin, about four years old and while he&#39;s excited to build the sets he gets, he still lacks the fine motor skills needed for Lego&#39;s precise placement.&nbsp; So juniorised&nbsp;builds certainly have a place because everyone, no matter how smart, starts somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, I remember being five years old and wanting all the Town Jr sets to build a city.&nbsp; It didn&#39;t bother me how it looked and I knew nothing about how &quot;juniorised&quot; and &quot;dumbed down&quot; Lego Town had become.&nbsp; All I knew was I could get a helicopter and a truck, two things I didn&#39;t own, and have my own mini police force?&nbsp; Sign me up!</p>

<p>But it&#39;s 20 years later and I doubt that any child nowadays is receiving&nbsp;this set new.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m reviewing this as an adult, and I&#39;m going to assume most of you reading this are adult collectors.&nbsp; So working on that basis, let&#39;s review this set from an adult perspective</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Starting off, you get three separate instructions here for some reason - one for the helicopter, one for the trailer and then one for the truck.&nbsp; Why Lego thought that this was a good way to ensure an easy start for kids is just...bizarre.&nbsp; I guess they did this so that no matter what you start building first, you have an instruction book.&nbsp; Saves you having to open in the middle of a book I guess.</p>

<p>Going section by section then, let&#39;s start with the truck itself, then the trailer and lastly the helicopter.</p>

<p>The truck is a&nbsp;disappointment.&nbsp; No working doors or storage&nbsp;but curiously it has a roof, made up of a black 4x4 brick with a slope at one end.&nbsp; This must be one of a few Town Jr sets where a vehicle actually has a roof, so that makes it a plus in my book.&nbsp; It also has two nice chrome smokestacks, right on the back of the truck, which is a bit of an odd detail.&nbsp; I&#39;d have thought if you were going this junior&nbsp;that you&#39;d leave those things out but it adds a nice realistic touch to an otherwise &quot;kiddy&quot; model.&nbsp; The entire truck is made up of 16 pieces, with a giant grey all-in-one chassis piece that is commonly found in Town Jr vehicles.&nbsp; It&#39;s overly simple and blob like.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know why Lego didn&#39;t decide to include working doors, honestly, it would add a play feature to the set.&nbsp; The roof is easy to take off and on as needed, which is great for play.</p>

<p>Moving on, the trailer is one massive grey piece which is sort of impressive given its size.&nbsp; The tyres attach to the bottom with axles, so it&#39;s a small relief they didn&#39;t just mould the axles on the way they did with the truck chassis.&nbsp; It has some nice trans-red 1x2 slope pieces to make up some landing lights, two trans-blue 1x2 slopes to make another landing light rig at the end of the trailer and&nbsp;some smaller 1x1 trans-blue round bricks to make...another kind of lighting rig?&nbsp; I think they&#39;re meant to be barriers for stopping traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s some storage hooks for a red megaphone and, of course, a radio.&nbsp; I feel like no matter what police set you bought in the 1990s, it would always come with a radio. There&#39;s some black tiles where the helicopter&#39;s skids land to avoid it getting stuck on the trailer, and a grey brick used as a sort of catch for the helicopter on the trailer.</p>

<p>Lastly, the helicopter.&nbsp; It&#39;s very simple, with the white bottom piece being an all-in-one construction.&nbsp; There&#39;s two printed police badges on grey bricks, a nice rear and top rotor and a small printed speed dial inside the canopy.&nbsp; It&#39;s got a nice trans-dark green canopy piece, which is hinged to allow access.&nbsp; It&#39;s kind of hard to get open at times because it can bang into the rotors above.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly enough, the landing skids are brick built which is a bit odd considering that Lego had already made a specialised piece for this purpose and used it in the TV Chopper.&nbsp; In fact, sometimes the landing skids are wobbly and shake a bit, so I would have preferred the use of the specialised TV Chopper skids.&nbsp; Maybe it wouldn&#39;t fit on the trailer...</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got two minifigures to round this out, a generic leathers police officer and a vested police officer.&nbsp; No one seems to be &quot;driver&quot; or &quot;pilot&quot; so who does what is up to you, and they mass well with the other 1990s police officers to make a great police force.</p>

<p>Look, if I&#39;m being honest?&nbsp; For me, as an adult reviewer in 2020, this&nbsp;is probably the second worst Town Jr building experience I&#39;ve had (second only to 6429 Blaze Responder, and that had a giant boat piece)&nbsp;because it&#39;s so simplistic.&nbsp; The truck is just a grey block, the entire lower half of the construction is that Town Jr one-piece chassis and the trailer is much of the same sort of construction.&nbsp; There&#39;s very little brick based construction here, no building up of elements.&nbsp; You jump around adding pieces here or there&nbsp;so there&#39;s very little sequential building, there&#39;s no flow.&nbsp; You just add details, you don&#39;t build structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the build to be quite unsatisfying to me as an adult and I don&#39;t know what a child would make of it.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>One thing I can&#39;t fault Town Jr for is the printed pieces - everything is printed, with no stickers, and that helps make these pieces versatile in other builds.&nbsp; The police blocks, the headlights of the truck, those are all really useful pieces.&nbsp; The green canopy and windshield pieces are really great for space builds, especially if you&#39;re trying to make a Classic Space MOC.</p>

<p>Are there any set exclusive pieces?&nbsp; Well, the 1x4 bricks with &#39;Police&#39; printed on them appeared in six sets.&nbsp; That white, inverted slope piece with the printed &#39;Police&#39; on it appeared in two other sets but this was the cheapest way to get it.&nbsp; The trans-green windshield on the truck appeared in three other sets from this time in that colour.&nbsp; The giant grey trailer one pieces appeared in one other set in this colour,&nbsp;T-Rex Transport (5975) so that might be an incentive to pick this up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The color scheme of this set - grey, black and trans-dark green - matches with that year&#39;s Town Jr police station so it all helps to tie it together as a unified, modern police force.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just think the pieces you get here are all so big and specialised, it makes it hard to use them for anything other than their intended construction here in this set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>See, this is where this set might have something going for it.&nbsp; A police helicopter can be the start of lots of stories. Maybe it&#39;s tracking a chase, looking for suspects, flying to visit another police station, dropping off cargo, delivering a message.&nbsp; Or maybe it&#39;s not being used by the police at all.&nbsp; Maybe it gets stolen by a prisoner, or hijacked by someone while it&#39;s being transported on the truck.&nbsp; A child could certainly use this as a great imaginative springboard for ideas.</p>

<p>As an adult though, there&#39;re some questions as to why there&#39;s a truck carrying a helicopter - it implies they might be shipping it elsewhere or taking it long distance somewhere.&nbsp; If it was a scenario in your city that required a helicopter, surely the police would just fly it there?&nbsp; Where the heck are the police going with this thing?&nbsp; Secondly, I feel like a helicopter works better with a base or central headquarters but that&#39;s just me and I understand why it&#39;s here - kids want a cheap way to get a helicopter and this set gives them one.</p>

<p>The truck lacks any sort of cupboards or storage compartments, and there&#39;s a lack of tools or interesting elements for the helicopter like, say, a fuel hose or a megaphone on the helicopter.&nbsp; Some extra hooks and tools would have been appreciated.</p>

<p>I feel like this whole trailer thing would have been better used as a mobile base, with scanning tools and radio/satellite stuff.&nbsp; Use some large panel pieces and make a small base or something to take to the site of an event which require police presence.&nbsp; That being said, that&#39;s an adult perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>I got this set, along with two small Chopper Cop (6324) for $15 dollars.&nbsp; That made it a good deal in my eyes, as you get two other cop minifigures and some tricycles (I hate the tricycles Lego made but whatever, that&#39;s besides the point)</p>

<p>I think, given the large pieces and specialised construction of the whole thing, you really shouldn&#39;t pay more than $12 to $18&nbsp;dollars for this.&nbsp; There&#39;s just not a lot here for an adult, it doesn&#39;t look good as a finished model.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>You know, I think reviewing this set has really revealed to me the contradiction in reviewing Town Jr sets.&nbsp; These sets were designed for young kids (as most Lego is), as juniorised sets,&nbsp;but the people collecting them nowadays are adults who desire more from Lego.&nbsp; Town Jr was line aimed at children first and foremost, and it was in a time in Lego&#39;s life where it wasn&#39;t doing so well as a company.&nbsp; So having me complaining&nbsp;lack of features or built up, all-in-one parts can be a bit silly.&nbsp; I know it wasn&#39;t for adults, it&nbsp;was for kids, and speaking as a young kid who had some Town Jr sets, it was fine.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think I knew better and I didn&#39;t know it could be better.</p>

<p>As a kid, I&nbsp;wanted this set when I used to look through the catalogues.&nbsp; Looking at the finished set now, on my floor, it doesn&#39;t really get me excited.&nbsp; I don&#39;t feel any sort of urge to pick it up and look at it from different angles, or swoosh the helicopter around.&nbsp; The build didn&#39;t feel fulfilling, you don&#39;t enter the &quot;Lego Zone&quot; where the fun of building something piece by piece takes you over.&nbsp; But then again, this set wasn&#39;t for adult me.&nbsp; It was for the younger me, it&#39;s for the kids who love cops, who want to chase the robbers.&nbsp; Would it excite them?&nbsp; I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I can only speak as an adult reviewing this set and as an adult, you won&#39;t get much from this set.&nbsp; It&#39;s a quick, unfulfilling building with&nbsp;the only&nbsp;result being overly blocky looking police vehicles, the same kind of police vehicles Lego pumps out year after year.&nbsp; I bought it on a whim and it&#39;ll be used to fill out my &#39;retro Lego 90&#39;s city&#39; display.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you see it on sale and it&#39;s a bargain, pick it up and use it for parts.&nbsp; Otherwise, let the past be the past.</p>
