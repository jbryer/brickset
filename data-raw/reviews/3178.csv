"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-03T06:16:19.4Z","LEGO Town (Shops and Services) - Truck Stop Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has 4 instructions. One is for the truck, the other one for the trailer, the third is for the front-end loader and the last one is for the café. All instructions - except the one for the café have two pages. The instruction for the café has 7 pages and there're no mistakes in any instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of good pieces for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure. We get a lot of white, red, blue and yellow pieces. I also like the big window piece for the building.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 3 minifigs. One of them is a construction worker who has a blue overall, a red cap and a beard on his face. The other figure is the truck driver who has a black cap, gray pants, a white vest and a blue shirt. The café owner has black hair, blue pants, a white shirt and red lips.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6329-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a lot of good stuff in it: We get a front-end loader, a truck with a trailer and a building. The shovel of the front-end loader can be adjusted and you can remove the ceiling of this vehicle very easily. The trailer of the truck can be removed very easily as well and we also can see some cool accessories there. The truck itself has a container on each side where you can store some stuff and the ceiling can be removed very easily, too. The café has a nice looking sign in the outside which shows you the food and we also get a nice sign on the top of the building. On the top you can also see two flags and on the ground where the other sign is you can see a flower. The door can be opened very easily and you can see a nice looking counter where you can find a sink, two glasses and a pizza. I really can't complain about this set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-09T20:24:59.623Z","Very neat little set, if you can find it.","<p>So next on the review list for me is 6329: Truck Stop Cafe. Having rebuilt it and looked it over for a while I have to say, I do quite like this one. It&#39;s an odd set, very few Lego ever made are anything like it, and it&#39;s quite scarce. The set is divided into four parts so I&#39;ll review them individually.</p>

<p><strong>1. The Semi Truck</strong>: I really like this thing. The pieces that make up the logo of presumably the trucking company are unique to this set and interesting (would be right at home on a ranch!). The truck actually has a roof, a rarity during this era for some reason. The smokestacks on it look good and realistic and my favorite is the two compartments for storing tools, emphasizing that this is a long-haul truck, which is very neat in my mind. As I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;ve always been more interested both as a kid and nowadays in modelling things I&#39;ve seen in real life, and large semi trucks with tool compartments are something you get out in the boonies on the highway so that was very cool to have in Lego form as a kid. I also am a sucker for places to put accessories, as anyone who&#39;s read my other reviews know. I enjoy being able to stash the accessories somewhere so they don&#39;t just clutter up a scene you make with the set, and this truck has two compartments to store all the tools it comes with, so A+ on the Lego designer&#39;s part there.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Semi Trailer: </strong>Probably both the weakest and strangest part of this set. I have no idea what this trailer&#39;s supposed to be. I&#39;ve seen a lot of semi trucks go rattling by and I&#39;ve never seen one that looks like this. The black divot-looking things are presumably supposed to be modeling something but I have no idea what. Their presence also means you can&#39;t really use this trailer as a flatbed trailer without removing them, which is easily done, but it makes you wonder why they&#39;re there in the first place. You *can* store the little digger that comes with the set on them... But it leaves an extra third one open to be used by nothing. I&#39;m at a loss for this one. The box and manual make no reference to them being used for anything.</p>

<p>The trailer&#39;s all one piece, I know some hate that but it&#39;s never really bothered me any (I also grew up with it so your results may vary) so the build of this part isn&#39;t much to write home about. It has a black tile on the back that I think is supposed to be a spoiler? Or something? No idea, and again, never seen a trailer with a spoiler. However, all the road construction accessories that come with the set do fit very well onto the trailer for transport and storage which is neat. There&#39;s a little detour flasher sign, a cone, and two barricades, and both fit well onto this trailer. It would have been nice for Lego to include a load for the trailer more substantial than this but that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Digger: </strong>This vehicle is... okay. It&#39;s not many pieces, though the actual bucket assembly is a pretty rare piece that serves its job well, and the yellow printed side panels aren&#39;t exactly easy to come by. There&#39;s no back to the bulldozer, which is odd to say the least, but it does at least have a roof and the black smokestack looks really cool. I mostly just find it odd this vehicle is included in this set... It&#39;s a truck stop. I guess bulldozers *can* stop at a truck stop but I&#39;ve never heard of one actually doing so. I don&#39;t know why Lego decided to have so many &quot;road repair&quot; elements in this set that&#39;s titled and presumably is about a Truck Stop Cafe. &quot;Truck Stop Cafe with a parking lot in desperate need of improvement&quot; is a more fitting title.</p>

<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>The Cafe: </strong>This is the best part of the set. It&#39;s juniorized as all getout but twelve year old me didn&#39;t really mind and I still don&#39;t, because it&#39;s so interesting. Lego doesn&#39;t make enough buildings (in my mind) that aren&#39;t one of the standards &quot;fire/police/train station/etc.&quot; paradigm and at the time I thought it was so cool to have an extra building for adventures to happen in. These days now that I&#39;m an old fogey and don&#39;t play with things so much as I just display them... It&#39;s still cool to have a small building that doesn&#39;t have the ever present Lego police state badge on the front of it.</p>

<p>This building is jam packed with rare or exclusive pieces, the window, the green striped awning, and the &quot;Cafe&quot; brick on top. The sign in front is so rare it may as well be an exclusive.</p>

<p>My only complaint about this building is the size... I wish Lego would&#39;ve made it about three times the size and taken out, say, the digger instead. For a set titled &quot;truck stop cafe&quot; the truck stop cafe is maybe a third of the total piece count and it&#39;s insanely tiny. It makes more sense for the building to be a convenience store or a drive-thru than a truck stop cafe, considering there&#39;s absolutely nowhere inside of it for minifigs to actually sit down. That said if you&#39;re a kid you can use your imagination to overcome this, so not a huge deal. I like the little tap piece on the counter and the clear mugs so it&#39;s not totally barren. More cool in concept than execution is what I&#39;m trying to say but they tried and it&#39;s fine for what it is.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong>: It&#39;s not the best nor the worst. To be totally honest I doubt I&#39;ll rate any of the 90&#39;s town sets super high in this catagory, they&#39;re all super easy to build. It&#39;s your standard 90&#39;s Lego small building and vehicle build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Now THIS is where this set shines. An incredible amount of rare and exclusive pieces on display here. The bull logo bricks, the cafe sign, the cafe window piece, and the green awning being the ones that aren&#39;t found anywhere else. The burger/pizza/fries panel being in this and one other set. The scoop assembly, blue arrow tile, stripey yellow bricks (of which you get four!), the stripey cone, and the trailer brick all being firmly in the &quot;hard to find&quot; category. The pizza bricks, clear mug bricks, flags, grill piece, and numerous smokestack pieces, while not exactly rare, aren&#39;t common either and are always useful to have more of. This set is a treasure trove of good and hard to find parts.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong>: I do wish Lego had been a bit more cohesive with adding things to this set, because then this category would be a firm five. As is, they&#39;re all plenty playable... Just not really *together*, as the digger and the semi only vaguely have anything to do with the Cafe. They&#39;re both good models in their own right though so a kid will have plenty of fun with them, just not maybe all at once. You can make very cool display scenes with them, though.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money: </strong>Low-ish marks in this category simply because nowadays you almost cannot find this set. It usually goes up on Flea-Bay for eighty to the hundreds of dollars and bricklink it&#39;s about as bad and super hard to get ahold of, usually being from overseas. Don&#39;t pay fifty bucks for it, it&#39;s not worth that, but if you can find it in the twenties it&#39;s well worth the investment for the hard to find bricks alone. The cafe&#39;s a neat addition to your town and the digger&#39;s better than the trainwreck that is the other 90&#39;s construction equipment. The semi is neat if strange. Pick it up if you can.</p>
