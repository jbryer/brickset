<p>Now that I have collected the entire series and had the experience of getting each of these figures and playing with them, I feel I have enjoyed this series to its fullest potential. It&#39;s been a fun ride, and now it&#39;s time to share my thoughts to you. This will be my longest review yet.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><i>The Scarlet Witch</i></p>

<p>This figure looks amazing, with sharp printing and a neat new headpiece. People have endlessly complained about her crown, but personally I love it. Her red power blasts are a fitting accessory, although a Darkhold print would&#39;ve been nice. She&#39;s overall a nice figure and I have no problems here besides the reused face print.</p>

<p><i>The Vision</i></p>

<p>Vision is decked out with amazing printing all over the front and the sides. The gold and lavender accents make this minifigure&nbsp;<strong>pop</strong>&nbsp;a little more. The accessory makes perfect sense here, and it&#39;s nice to see some printed pieces for a change. This is definitely in the top 3 figures of this series for me.</p>

<p><i>Monica Rambeau&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>People often rant about how bad Monica is, but I don&#39;t really think she&#39;s awful. Her new hair and faceprint are both awesome, but her torso is an inaccurate color. This doesn&#39;t bother me much, as the figure looks good either way. The accessory really sinks this minifigure, as it&#39;s just a boring toy plane. No S.W.O.R.D. logo is present, just a small build.</p>

<p><em>Winter Soldier</em></p>

<p>Bucky is one of the less interesting figures present in this series. He&#39;s not a very spectacular or grand figure, but I guess he has to be here. I have no complaints with him, I just like some other minifigures more.</p>

<p><em>Captain America</em></p>

<p>This Sam Wilson minifigure is easily the best one we&#39;ve received from LEGO&nbsp;yet.&nbsp;He looks so great, every single detail enhances this minifigure. The wings are done&nbsp;<em>perfectly</em>&nbsp;and his accessories are perfectly fitting. No problems here, go out and buy this one.</p>

<p><em>Loki</em></p>

<p>Loki somehow ends up being one of my favorites&nbsp;in this series. He doesn&#39;t need to have extravagant details. The accessory also boosts this minifigure a lot. Throg is really neat, and I really love that LEGO did this. My only complaint is that this figure lacks shoe printing.</p>

<p><em>Sylvie</em></p>

<p>Sylvie isn&#39;t too great of a minifigure in my opinion. The lack of leg printing definitely hurts this figure a bit, but the accessory makes up for it. The arm printing looks nice, but I&#39;m not very invested in this character and the minifigure looks quite plain. Alligator Loki is cute, but the lack of the crown is disappointing.</p>

<p><em>Zombie Hunter Spidey</em></p>

<p>Spidey here looks awesome, with side arm and leg printing and dual-molded legs. I find it <em>strange </em>(get it?)&nbsp;that they don&#39;t introduce the new Cloak of Levitation piece here. The web piece featured here is a fitting accessory.</p>

<p><em>Zombie Captain America</em></p>

<p>Zombie Cap is easily the best zombie minifigure by far. Every side of him is covered in detail to make him look beaten up. The worn-out shield is an especially nice figure that can easily be used outside this figure. This is probably the figure that least needed to be in here though. I would&#39;ve preferred Ultron, and him not being in this series makes me a little mad at this figure&#39;s inclusion.</p>

<p><em>Captain Carter</em></p>

<p>Captain Carter is a must-have for any fans of&nbsp;<em>What If...</em><em>?</em>, as she was certainly a standout character. She is decked out, with printing all over the sides. Her shield is perfect, although my copy was noticeably off-center. This is an all-around great figure.</p>

<p><em>T&#39;Challa Star-Lord</em></p>

<p>T&#39;Challa Star-Lord is also a great minifigure with decent accessories. The guns are perfectly fitting, but I would&#39;ve liked the Power Stone orb. The helmet is also a great inclusion, although lacking some silver printing present on other Star-Lord helmets. The two new molds (the helmet and hair) are perfect. I&#39;m so glad we finally have a T&#39;Challa face and hair. This is an especially nice tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, may he rest in peace.</p>

<p><em>Gamora with Blade of Thanos</em></p>

<p>Gamora is one of the less interesting figures here, but that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s worthless. The armor looks great, but it makes me wish that Thanos from the Sanctuary 2 set was given such treatment. Her blade looks good, although a new mold for this would&#39;ve been better. This is a good figure, but not necessarily one of my favorites.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For $5 a pop, these figures are certainly worth it (most of them at least). Every single figure comes with&nbsp;some kind of nice detail, such as side printing or a new mold. These figures have such a high calibre of detail which alone makes them worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the new Disney+ series coming out, these characters are incredibly desirable in LEGO form. That makes these figures a lot more valuable for kids and adults alike. Kids can have fun collecting these great characters, and adults can collect these for display.</p>

<p>Every figure is beautifully made, making them good display pieces, especially with other figures from the same show. They also have good play value, with interesting accessories. An improvement LEGO could&#39;ve made is including some villains, as Zombie Cap is really the only antagonist. This change could&#39;ve enhanced the play value. Still, these minifigures are certainly a bang for your buck.</p>

	<li>Good parts that can be reused for purist customs</li>
	<li>Great display and play value</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Some important characters missing</li>
	<li>A few boring minifigures</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Character Choices</b></p>

<p>I feel most of the character choices here were justified. Obvious choices were Wanda, Vision, Sam, Bucky, Loki, Sylvie, Captain Carter, and T&#39;Challa. That leaves us with Gamora, Zombie Cap and Spidey, and Monica. I think some major missing characters were Agatha, Ultron, Party Thor, Killmonger, John Walker, Zemo, Mobius, Apocalypse Black Widow, and Strange Supreme. Strange, Ultron, Agatha, and John Walker were the biggest missed opportunities here. I hope LEGO makes these figures at some point, but I think the chance of it is low.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Collecting every figure in this series has certainly been a ride. I&#39;ve loved this entire experience. Along with the great figures, the memories I&#39;ve made with these figures will live on with me forever. I implore you to go out and get these figures while you can. They&#39;re all really great, and I hope you enjoy them as much as I have!</p>
