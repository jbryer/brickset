<p>With the release of <i>Wandavision&nbsp;</i>earlier this year, the LEGO community was dying to get their hands on some minifigures from the iconic show. I am relatively pleased with how this figure turned out, although it does come with some setbacks.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>This figure is notorious for its hair-crown piece. Unlike the crown of another figure in this series, Sylvie, Wanda&#39;s crown is printed onto her hairpiece. It looks awful in the pictures, but it&#39;s starting to grow on me now that I have it in person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The face print is reused from the Endgame Final Battle set. I am slightly bothered by the reuse, as this is a CMF series and I expect better than a reused face print. Additionally, both expressions on her face and happy and cheery, a sharp contrast from Wanda&#39;s personality.</p>

<p>Her torso and legs have some incredible printing, which is enough to redeem this figure for me. I am also glad that she comes with dual-molded arms, which accurately portray her costume from the show.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Wanda&#39;s only accessories are two red power blasts, which are appropriate and a huge improvement from the bright pink blast and splat pieces included in the aforementioned Endgame Final Battle. Of course, I would&#39;ve wanted a tile to represent the Darkhold, but I understand that LEGO probably didn&#39;t have a reference for that.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>As I said before, the great printing and overall high quality of this minifigure definitely reflect LEGO&#39;s dedication to making this a great CMF series. There&#39;s a lot of play value here with the projectile shooters, as well as display value. I&#39;d gladly pay $5 for a figure like this.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Even with certain disappointments that come with this figure, I still love it to death. I am overjoyed that we got any LEGO figures for&nbsp;<em>Wandavision</em>, and I&#39;d recommend that any Marvel or&nbsp;<em>Wandavision</em>&nbsp;fans pick this figure up as soon as possible.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2021-09-08T19:21:31.82Z","The Scarlet Witch: Review and Feel Guide!","<p>The Marvel Collectible Minifigure Series is finally releasing, and I know a lot of LEGO and Marvel fans are after these! Scarlet Witch begins this series with a bang, and in this review I will be breaking down this entire figure, as well as giving you tips on how to feel for her as you look for her yourself!</p>

<p>As we look at the figure we must break down each individual part, starting with the hairpiece!</p>

<p>The Hairpiece: This figure has a beautiful new hairpiece that envelops the crown she wears in WandaVision&#39;s finale into a hairpiece that is accurate for the character. I have heard, and I understand the complaints about this not being a dual moulded hairpiece, meaning that we would have the red from the crown on both sides. I personally am not bothered at that detail. I think it would have been fine had they done that, they did it with Sylvie, but the difference between the two characters designs is that for Wanda in her show, the crown was levitating against her, she did not appear to be wearing it around her, while with Sylvie&#39;s design, her crown in the Loki series goes around her head. I&#39;m probably looking too far into this, but if you have seen the Disney Plus shows, you might know what I&#39;m talking about. Anyway, back to the actual piece, this hairpiece is new, and I believe it could go on to have other uses for LEGO in other sets. In Marvel alone it could be recoloured and used for Agatha Harkness, or even in an Infinity Saga set with Hela. The sky is the limit for the potentials of this new piece.</p>

<p>The Head: The head here is reused from the Infinity Saga set that also came out this year, and while I like that it matches her hairpiece, her expressions might be a bit too cheery. On the one side, you have an average where she is generally happy, which is fine. The character is a very serious one in her show, but she does smile some, so this is fine. However, on the other side she has her red eyes signifying that she is using her powers, but she is still grinning. It feels a bit out of place and unlike the character. I still like the minifigure, I just wish that one of the two faces had herewith an angry, or at least serious expression.</p>

<p>The Cape: This figure has a softer felt cape, that has one hole to fit on the neck. I like how the hairpiece holds this cape down, but to be honest, the figure looks better without the cape, as well as more accurate to her appearance in her respected show. I have seen people use her felt skirt on this figure, and I would recommend that. It really compliments the figure, and it is the one thing I have changed about this figure for myself. In my opinion, this improves her, but she does look just fine with cape, and as a final note, it is definitely useful to always have extras of these capes for any characters you choose to make yourself.</p>

<p>The Torso: This really is the best part of the figure. She is decked out with a very detailed front and back, as well as arm printing. We could see another Scarlet Witch minifig next year with the Doctor Strange 2 sets, I believe that we won&#39;t get her this detailed though ever again. If you are looking to make an accurate Scarlet Witch, this torso is a must-have.</p>

<p>The Legs: Her Legs carry directly off of the Torso printing, and I think the design of it really works. I had mentioned the use of a felt skirt piece around the legs, while it looks good, it is completely unnecessary because of it being printed on the legs. I really appreciate the printing on the toes, as this level of detail is impressive for a LEGO Marvel figure. I wish we would see this outside of a CMF series.</p>

<p>Accessories: To round out our review, we need to discuss this minifigs accessories. Compared to other figures, Wanda&#39;s red power blasts could be considered weak.&nbsp;I appreciate LEGO giving us the power blasts in red, but we should have had them a long time ago. I won&#39;t get into the debate of how exactly you fire these &quot;power blasts&quot;, but they look cool, and have become a staple for superhero sets. Sure Wanda could have been given many other accessories from the show, but I support this because it is a new colour for these power blasts.</p>

<p>Feel Guide: Now that we have assessed the minifig, let&#39;s talk about how to find her in those pesky CMF blindbags. For me, it was the power blasts. I was trying to find something in the bag that would be unique, and that is really key for finding any of the figures. Every hero comes with a stand that feels similar to the power blasts, but if you push the power blast to the corner of the bag, you are able to feel around it and feel the handle. After you believe you have found the power blasts, feel for her hairpiece. Believe it or not, you can feel the details of the crown. Make sure you don&#39;t feel for the hairpiece only though because Sylvie&#39;s hairpiece has a crown in it as well.</p>

<p>Conclusion: This figure really was a necessity in a series based off of the Disney Plus shows. Overall, LEGO did a great job transferring this character into LEGO form. If you enjoyed this review, keep an eye out for more coming. I plan on posting reviews for these figures daily, and I hope this was helpful! Until next time, keep on&nbsp;rocking!</p>
