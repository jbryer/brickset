<p>The Vision played a large part in the&nbsp;<em>Wandavision</em>&nbsp;show, so it stands to reason that he&#39;d be in this series. The figure has an overall high calibre of detail, and I&#39;m satisfied with him even with the inaccuracies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Starting at the head, the printing is already incredible. I&#39;m not terribly disappointed that the printing doesn&#39;t continue all the way around, as I know that it&#39;s far too expensive for LEGO to do (even though we&#39;ve seen figures with printing all the way around the head in CMF series before). A minor nitpick here is that the stone on his head is gold instead of the blue that was featured in the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cape attached is one of the spongy capes that come in the Juniors sets. With no hairpiece to hold it down, the cape tends to bounce a lot.</p>

<p>The design on the torso and legs looks incredible, especially with the chrome gold and lavender highlights. They are inaccurate, but looks spectacular nonetheless.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Vision comes with a small laptop, which has some cool details which reference&nbsp;<em>Wandavision</em>. This accessory may be bland, but I really can&#39;t think of anything better to include.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>This minifigure certainly displays a great degree of printing quality. Vision certainly makes up for his price by showing a level of detail that we rarely see.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>While some inaccuracies may hold this figure back for some people, I personally don&#39;t mind. He is a great figure to display along with Wanda, and he is also a recognizable enough character for kids to like. I encourage all Marvel fans to go pick up this figure, along with the others in this series.</p>

Okay, enough of obsessively saying Vision! Today we get to look at dare I say the most detailed figure of the series! It&#39;s so far been a steady race between Zombie Cap and Zombie Hunter Spidey in my past reviews (feel free to go check those out and catch up), but in my opinion, Vision blows the competition we have seen so far away. He in fact might only be rivalled by Sam Wilson Captain America, who we&#39;ll be looking at next, but for today&#39;s review, we&#39;re going to dive into this figure, but stick around until the end to see a guide on how to feel out this minifig from those pesky blindbags, or just skip down there now if you&#39;re anxious to find this fabulous figure fast! Let&#39;s begin!</p>

<p>Head: As always, we start at the top and work down. This Minifigure is the only one to not include a hairpiece, which sets it apart as we&#39;ll talk about in the feel guide later. Anyway, because of no hairpiece, this head of course is not double-sided, but rather it has details on the back and a face print on the front. I have heard the complaints about the eyes not being blue, or human-like as they are in the show. To this complaint, I have to remind everyone that the past versions of Vision did not ever include eyes that looked like the regular Minifigures either, and it&#39;s probably just a design choice on LEGO&#39;s part&nbsp;which makes sense. Regular eyes would look rather disturbing in my opinion for this character. It would be like the random colour change on Teen Groot in the recent Benatar set. I prefer what we got, but I&nbsp;understand the want for more accurate eyes. Personally, I&#39;m just impressed that LEGO ever made this character. Without any sets for the show, logically it would seem improbable to ever get this character, and even when the series was initially announced, I didn&#39;t expect this character to make the cut instead of another Vision variant from earlier episodes, however, this being the current state of Vision in the MCU, I am much happier we got him here. Another complaint about the head is the place where the gem once was, it was blue in the show, and is now orange here. While this complaint is valid, the gem originally was also the wrong colour, and I don&#39;t think this one slight difference ruins the figure at all for me. I still like it, and I think it works. There&#39;s several other details on the head such as technological lines being a base detail throughout the face, and then on the sides of the face we get a darker grey detail, which is realistic too with the character. Onto the cape.</p>

<p>The Cape: I&#39;m going to have to briefly rant on the cape. If you stand this figure straight up, the cape will not lay&nbsp;against the figure as you would want it to. It instead sticks straight out and looks really peculiar. I know people like these softer capes, but it is undeniable that they don&#39;t behave like capes. They look weird and are annoying to continually force down. Unfortunately, white capes are also really rare, so this isn&#39;t really something you can just switch out at home usually. The Cape doesn&rsquo;t ruin the figure for me though, because as it insists on sticking straight out, it gives a great view of the details on the back of the torso. Maybe that&#39;s what LEGO was going for, if so, please give us real capes and detailed torsos, don&#39;t just give us one or the other. Speaking of detailed torsos though...</p>

<p>The Torso: Gotta love this torso. From the arms to the front to the back, this torso is remarkable. Here on the torso a light grey colour scheme stars that carries over to the legs. The LEGO Marvel community is a bit split on whether this works or not. My opinion is that it looks great, and it&#39;s pretty accurate to the show. On this light grey colour, we have a mix of white and gold details stretching all around him, including onto the arms. LEGO went all out, beautifully having these same details cross over onto the arms. I&#39;m impressed at just what LEGO Marvel Minifigures can look like, LEGO has stepped up their game quite a bit. This gold mixes so well, and we can see it make it&#39;s descend onto the legs.</p>

<p>The Legs: Which is better, the torso or the legs? I&#39;m going to go with legs. Side leg printing like this is unbelievable, and something you don&#39;t see on basically 90% of all Minifigures. This printing on the sides, as well as the front make this figure a masterpiece, not to mention how well the dual coloured look works as it transitions perfectly from light grey to white. It just really can&#39;t be compared to even the other versions of vision we have got, as it continues to impress more and more every time you look at it.</p>

<p>Accessory: Vision comes with one accessory here, a computer with a printed screen describing the Vision Residence in Westview. For those of us who watched show, this serves as a fun Easter egg that I&#39;m glad was included. To the younger audience that might not have seen the show, this serves as just a fun computer inclusion. Either way, I really think it works. The piece usually used to make a book is used here as a computer with a translucent blue printed tile inside as a keyboard. I appreciate this accessory, and am happy LEGO gave this figure one when he could have just as easily not had one.</p>

<p>Feel Guide: I&#39;m going to warn you, this is the hardest figure in the series to find, it won&#39;t be easy at all. People have said just feel for a hairpiece, if there isn&#39;t one, you found Vision. Technically, yeah, that would work, but instead of feeling for what&#39;s not there, we can also feel for what is. The computer piece is significant because if you get a good feel on it, you know exactly what it is. This is what I&#39;d advise because the 2x1 flat tile feels too similar to the stand piece that they all have. Make sure when you think you found the book piece you feel is square and not the tip of Cap&#39;s&nbsp;wings.</p>

<p>Conclusion: So that rounds out a full review and feel guide on this figure. When I first saw this series, I knew Vision was a must-have, and I believe I was right. This figure lives up to the character it&#39;s based upon, and it makes me look forward to what LEGO Marvel can be like from now on. This figure is my favorite that I have reviewed so far, but Cap could beat him next review, so stay posted for that. As always, if you enjoyed the review, or found the feel guide helpful, I&#39;d appreciate it if you let me know below, seeing people enjoying these reviews encourages me to keep on reviewing. Until we get a Magician Vision based on Episode 2, keep on rocking!</p>
