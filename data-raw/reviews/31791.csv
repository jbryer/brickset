<p>This figure certainly is a controversial one. I initially disliked this figure, but after further reflection I realise that it isn&#39;t as bad as everyone says it is. Many parts here are usable outside this context, and it&#39;s great for diversity in LEGO.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Starting at the top, this figure comes with a spectacular new hairpiece. It&#39;s great that LEGO is really committing to adding more diverse characters. This only continues with the new head, which can be used for other figures as well (Although it is disappointing that it doesn&#39;t have Monica&#39;s bright blue eyes printed on it).</p>

<p>The torso and arms are sadly an inaccurate color, but her outfit wasn&#39;t that noteworthy, so I&#39;ll let it slide here. I love the arm printing as well, though in person it does suffer from some printing issues, as it appears smudged. Unfortunately, there is no leg printing. I&#39;m fine with this choice, as this costume doesn&#39;t have much on the legs, but I wish they&#39;d given us just a bit of printing.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>This figure comes with the S.W.O.R.D. helicopter-drone that is sent into the Hex. It looks alright, but there aren&#39;t any prints on it to differentiate it from, let&#39;s say, and advent calendar build.</p>

<p>Every figure in this series comes with a special piece to pose figures more uniquely.</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>This figure does feel like it is worth $5, but I wish it had some more interesting accessories and printing to make it stand out a bit more.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I certainly like this figure more now that I have it in hand, but it definitely isn&#39;t my favorite. One of my largest gripes with it is that we could&#39;ve got Agatha Harkness in place of this one. I understand the choice to not include her, as this series focuses more on the heroes than the villains, but her costume was much more interesting than Monica&#39;s. However, I still like this figure, and I am proud of LEGO for committing to more diverse characters. I&#39;d recommend this figure to any Marvel fan, or to someone looking to diversify their LEGO collecting.</p>
