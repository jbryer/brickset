"PerryThePlatypus","2021-09-02T17:58:11.483Z","The new Captain makes his big debut!","<p>The Marvel series has garnered a lot of excitement and anticipation with a lot of unique figures that seem to please fans for the most part. Falcon in particular stood out from the rest of the series due to his impressive printing and detailing all around, let me just say, the hype for him was totally justified.</p>

<p>Starting from the legs, they feature fantastic printing and detailing with absolutely insane side leg printing for his boots, honestly some of the best side leg printing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The torso continues the Captain America design with the usual colors you&rsquo;d expect, arm printing is present and just like the legs, are absolutely perfect. 1 of the 2 new pieces introduced with this figure is the new Falcon wings which feature printing on it front and back, it has a stud at the back where Redwing (represented as a printed triangular tile) rests and there are bars at each end of the wing where printed flaps could be attached and adjusted, this is certainly the best Falcon wings to date. The face print is&nbsp;a confident expression with his goggles on, the goggle strap&nbsp;continues to the back of the head print but unfortunately cuts in between,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s not a huge issue though and I could easily overlook it. The second new piece introduced is the hair, it&rsquo;s very short which I like and I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t just a reuse of the Finn hair piece. Finally, his accessory is a new print for the Captain America shield and it certainly improves upon previous designs.</p>

<p>Overall, Lego outdid themselves with the Marvel series and this figure in particular. The printing is top-notch, the new wings came out just great, everything about this figure is perfect. Very high quality stuff, I&rsquo;m super happy with it and can&rsquo;t wait to complete the series. 10/10 go get it.</p>

<p>I love this figure so much, and I&#39;m sure you all do too. I don&#39;t have much to say here, I&#39;m just really happy to have this figure.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>This minifigure is decorated from head to toe with detail. Sam has a new element for his hairpiece, which is incredibly useful for custom figures. His faceprint perfectly matches Anthony Mackie&#39;s likeness, although I find the lack of printing on the side of the head a bit distracting.</p>

<p>This figure comes with all kinds of printing, on the torso and legs, and on the sides of both the arms and legs. It also comes with dual molded arms and legs. The detail looks excellent all over, and the prospect of getting figures like this for $5 is incredibly exciting.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Sam comes with the iconic Captain America shield. This accessory is fitting, and I&#39;d like to point out that the design is different from the one that came in the Infinity Saga sets of this year. It has new details which appear to be more accurate.</p>

<p>The wings are particularly impressive, featuring detail on both sides. I could see this new mold being repurposed for Falcon minifigures. Redwing is also featured (though this drone isn&#39;t so red), using the 2x2 triangle piece to great effect.</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>This figure certainly shows off how much detail LEGO can pack into a minifigure. It is&nbsp;<em>undoubtedly&nbsp;</em>worth $5. It also has some play value with the wings and will look great with Bucky on display. The value here is incredibly good.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I absolutely ADORE this figure. I was so excited to get my hands on it, and in person it is much better. The silver printing&nbsp;all throughout this figure really complete the look. All the small and intricate details on this figure make it an 11/10 minifig for me. Go out and get this figure!!</p>

<p>- a very happy Christmaskingcool</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&rdquo; was the one MCU&nbsp;Disney+ show I wasn&#39;t bothered about as to me, it was a fine 2 and 1/2-hour film stretched out into a poorly paced&nbsp;6 hour TV show, however when the rumours of a Marvel CMF series came out I wanted the Falcon and Winter Soldier Minifigures as previously they were characters I didn&#39;t have, but when this series was revealed I never expected my favourite of the CMF to be one from my least favourite area of source material.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure has a new hair piece which is perfect as there was no other way to capture the look of the suit and hair together, the head is great featuring a smirk with back printing as well, now, (including comic/game based Falcons) the wings for him have never looked good in previous sets however there is a new big neck attachment with plating printing on each side and on the back, there is also a hollow stud in the centre and two cut flags on each end in light grey with more printing on both sides, the torso is fantastic with its printing and the dual moulded and printed arms just elevate it even more and the legs are jaw dropping with the wrap around printing covering the dual moulded legs.</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include the best Captain America shield ever with the silver outline to make it more accurate to the MCU and his other accessory is Redwing who is printed on a 2&times;2 triangular light grey tile and is intended to attach to the hollow stud on his wings. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1&times;2 black jumper and an action pose piece for extra pose ability in display.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This may be my favourite Minifigure of all time it is so detailed and accurate to the final episode, although I still find the prospect of the best Marvel Minifigure ever made being Captain America but not Steve Rogers a conundrum, but that does not matter as this figure is great, you should definitely try and get it if you&#39;re interested and that&#39;s why I recommend it.&nbsp;</p>

"normanpricecom","2021-10-30T02:04:33.82Z","Possibly the best Marvel mini figure of all time","<p>This mini figure is brilliant! The stand is the normal black stand with a 1 by 1 with a hole in it and an action pose stand there. The legs have side printing and are dual moulded, while the grey boots have red decorations. The body is like Steve Rogers&#39; Captain America. The arms are dual moulded with a star and some blasters on it and the wings are detailed like the usual Falcon wings. Redwing, unlike in the comics, is not an actual falcon, but high-tech. The head has a happy smile on it behind a mask and the hair is exclusive, but I am not a fan. The shield is also like Steve Rogers&#39; shield, except for lines on the white part closest to the edge.</p>

<p>My opinion of this minifig (good, bad or meh) is good.&nbsp;</p>
