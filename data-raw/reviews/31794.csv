<p>One of the highlights of the summer was&nbsp;<em>Loki</em>, a show which changed the MCU forever. It has been my favorite Disney+ show so far, hence I was thrilled to get my hands on this Loki figure.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Loki is probably the least detailed figure&nbsp;in this series. I could reasonably see this coming in a wide-released LEGO set. While this may seem like a con, I am still able to appreciate this figure. The jacket looks sleek, and the new hair and head match Tom Hiddleston very well. I&#39;d like to point out the word &#39;variant&#39; written in bright orange on the back of his jacket.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>The first accessory is a coffee cup, and I am delighted to see the sharp printing of the TVA logo on the white mug piece.</p>

<p>The standout accessory here is definitely Throg. He looks adorable with all the printing and the tiny helmet on his head. In my opinion, he&#39;s one of the coolest accessories that LEGO has ever made.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>While this figure is not detailed on all sides, I still feel that it is worth the five bucks you pay for it. The accessories elevate the value of the figure, and the figure isn&#39;t bad by any means.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Even though this isn&#39;t the most colorful or bright figure in the series, it is still one of my favorites. I love the simplistic but effective printing on it and the Throg piece is also incredibly special. I&#39;d recommend this to any fans of the&nbsp;<em>Loki</em> show or of the MCU in general.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2021-09-08T23:15:05.767Z","Loki: Review and Feel Guide!","<p>Introduction: I know what you&#39;re thinking. Another folksy dopey review from a folksy dope. And if you thought that, you were kind of right, but at the end of the review I&#39;ll give you some tips on how to find a Loki in those pesky CMF (Collectible Minifigure Series) bags. So stick around for that, at the end, or just skip to it now if you want to. And also, as always, if you enjoyed this, I would appreciate it if you let me know by saying this was helpful. It just encourages me to keep making these reviews for everyone! Before we get into the full breakdown of the minifigure, I would like to briefly warn about spoilers for the Loki show on Disney Plus, I won&#39;t mention anything about it besides the accessories paragraph, so if you want to avoid spoilers, that is where they will all be. This Minifigure is in my top five&nbsp;of the series, and is probably in my top ten Marvel minifigures ever made. The level of detail is amazing, and it is rivalled in this series by only Captain America, Zombie Cap, White Vision, and Zombie Hunter Spider-Man. Overall this entire minifigure series is amazing, and I recommend all the figures to LEGO fans and Marvel fans. All except maybe Monica Rambou. Or Gamora. Anyway, let&#39;s get rocking with this review!</p>

<p>The Hair: Loki&#39;s hair has become very iconic to his look, and before this figure, I believe LEGO was belittling is by using that generic long hair piece. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that hair piece, it just doesn&#39;t do justice to the god of mischief. Here, the piece that was used for Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Last Jedi is recoloured in black and looks great for Loki here. I hope that we see this hairpiece used more in the Marvel Superheroes line for Thor or even for Ego (if LEGO ever did Infinity Saga sets with characters people want).</p>

<p>The Head: Wow, just wow. His face printing is perfect here. It suits the character so well, and it really completes the figure for me. The history of Loki heads&nbsp;is pretty vast. He&#39;s had many variants if you will, premiering in the first LEGO Marvel Superhero sets back in 2012 with a very bland face print that had been reused from Lex Luthor. Back then this was acceptable for fans, as we were finally getting LEGO Avengers! Since 2012 LEGO has shown just how much detail they can add to Minifigures proving themselves better year after year. It wasn&#39;t until five years after the Avengers sets in 2017 that we got another Loki (not counting mighty micros). This Loki was much more accurate, but still disappointing as it didn&#39;t look too much like Tom Hiddleston&#39;s appearance. Then as a hurtful blow to desperate Marvel LEGO fans, in 2020 we got an $80 Loki appearance in a four plus set with a much better torso printing, but the same old Lex Luthor face! That might have been the worst thing that happened that year... but anyway, here in 2021 we have this Loki figure that finally has truly accurate facial expressions. Good job LEGO, good job.</p>

<p>The Torso: I was blown away by what LEGO did here on the torso! Not only do we get this charming outfit that is accurate to the show, we got a TVA belt, a TVA badge, and the word &quot;Variant&quot; on the back. Do you hear that? It&#39;s LEGO Marvel fans weeping with joy as this character gets the minifigure treatment he deserves. The front printing has him decked out in an accurate tie, and this look is based off of Loki Episode 2 where we saw Loki deck himself out with TVA propaganda. This propaganda is not left out as wee see the Time Variance Authority, (A.K.A. the TVA), mentioned on his belt and badge, and his first accessory, the coffee cup, we&#39;ll touch on that in a bit though. The beige of the jacket is very nice and carries over to the arms. Arm printing would have been nice, but I really cannot complain, all they could have added was maybe a few buttons around the wrist. On the back he has the word &quot;Variant&quot; in all orange, which is an astounding detail that I&#39;m glad was included. This is accurate as we see the Variant label mentioned several times in the show, and even mentioned being on the back of his jacket. As well as the variant detail, there&#39;s a few creases that really serve as just the cherry on top of this amazing figure.</p>

<p>The Legs: The Leg printing does everything I would ask the leg printing to do. It perfectly carries down from the torso and provides other details to round out the figure. Here it does this very well as it gives him the accurate brown pants with his jacket carrying over and down on top of them.</p>

<p>The Accessories: I had mentioned earlier that there would be a spoiler section, and here it is, if you want to avoid spoilers, skip on down to the feel guide, I&#39;ll see you there. We have two great accessories with Loki, we are going to look at both, and then talk about what else could have been included. First, we look at the TVA coffee cup. I don&#39;t actually recall seeing this coffee cup in the show, but it is still a nice detail. I believe because of details like the cup this figure feels more real, and the cup in great for collectors who want to display him with it, as well as for playability. The second accessory is the infamous Throg! His inclusion probably feels random, even for those who have seen the show. Throg was in fact in Loki, but only for a brief second as we saw him try to escape a jar. It was taken as just a fun detail in the show, but now he gets to steal the show in this series. There was originally going to be more of Throg in the show, but it was cut out, and he ended up just cameoing in the one scene. I would love to see this character pop up again in the MCU, and I&#39;m glad he was still in this series. Besides, he pairs well with Alligator Loki who comes with Sylvie. I also imagine that Throg was a favourite for the younger audience seeking this series. I mean, come on, what kid doesn&#39;t want a hammer wielding amphibian? I grew up loving them too. In all seriousness, I truly am content with Loki&#39;s accessories, and I can only name two items I would have traded the coffee cup for. One would be a dagger. We see Loki using daggers often un his show. The other item would be a &quot;Tem-Pad&quot;, the device used by the TVA to travel accordingly through time. Other than that, I&#39;m happy with his accessories.</p>

<p>Feel Guide: So, you want to find a Loki for yourself? Great choice, but how do you find him in those pesky blind bags? Here&#39;s my advice on it. Loki&#39;s head, torso, and legs are going to feel the exact same as everyone else&#39;s, so no luck there. I would go for the coffee cup. If you already have this piece, practice feeling it at home before going to the store. If you don&#39;t already have it, I feel like by just looking at the cup you can get an idea of how it feels. I know it might be tempting to feel for Throg instead, but it&#39;s really difficult to distinguish him from Alligator Loki. Feel for the coffee cup, then to double-check, feel for Throg, then feel for the hair piece. Loki&#39;s hairpiece feels too similar to Wanda&#39;s in the bag, but Wanda has nothing that feels like a coffee cup, and she definitely has nothing that feels like Throg.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Overall, this figure is great, and an amazing transformation for the character to LEGO form. I said it before, I will say it again, if you are a Marvel or LEGO fan, or especially both, you want this figure, and you better hurry because he has definitely been singled out as a favourite in the series. Anyway, that&#39;s today&#39;s review, if you enjoyed it you can let me know by saying so, I appreciate the encouragement to keep doing these reviews. I plan on reviewing Zombie Cap tomorrow, so stay posted for that, and as always, keep on rocking!</p>

"SlimBrick1","2021-11-13T21:33:02.43Z","Great figure!","<p>To be completely honest, nobody bought this figure for Loki. I personally bought it just for Throg XD But I will review the fig anyways. I think this figure was one of the better ones of the series, his torso and head printing are top-notch, and the subtle crease printing on his legs is great. It is nice to have the printed TVA mug, and the Luke Skywalker hair piece in black is great for custom figs. The back printing has the word VARIENT on the back of it, a good detail from the show that if it had not been added, it would have been a lesser figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Throg figure is a great new mould, with the little tiny Mjolner in his hand, and the cape and helmet. The tiny printing just added a step-up on this figure, and the fact that LEGO even bothered to add his red cape is awesome.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FINAL VERDICT: I would totally recommend this fig out of all the figs in the series. Though he may not be as good as T&#39;challa Star Lord, Zombie Cap, or the falcon figures, he is definitely better than Monica XD</p>
