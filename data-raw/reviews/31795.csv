One of the biggest ones in particular was Sylvie. I&rsquo;m not necessarily saying she&rsquo;s a bad figure, in fact I&rsquo;d actually call her a good figure that I simply have some issues with.</p>

<p>Straight away, one of the problems are present with the legs just being plain black, and with a series that goes above and beyond with detailing, the lack of leg print here feels lazy. The torso however was done excellently with the pearl dark gray armor and the gold trims, the dual-molded arms have printing as well with a gold circles pattern, everything regarding the torso is perfect. And&hellip; back to the negatives, the face prints are the biggest problem for me. They&rsquo;re too cheerful, too childish and they just don&rsquo;t fit Sylvie in the slightest, I seriously can&rsquo;t stress enough how much they look like a child&rsquo;s face. If the face prints were done well, I would&rsquo;ve liked this figure a lot more. The hair piece though is great, using a new dual-molded design with short tan hair and the gold tiara with the accurate single-broken horn, I think the hair color should&rsquo;ve been a darker shade, but I don&rsquo;t really mind. Finally, her accessories include a green machete (which they give you an extra of!) and Alligator Loki, which uses a new piece that looks adorable, although a crown element was unfortunately not included, I understand why, but it still leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s far from perfect, but I actually still like it. I can acknowledge its problems and how it could be improved, and don&rsquo;t get me wrong, those child face prints frustrate me, but I can&rsquo;t bring myself to dislike the figure as a whole.&nbsp;And the accessories, even with the inaccurate alligator Loki, are also great. So even with its issues, I&rsquo;m comfortable calling it a good figure, and I&rsquo;d still strongly recommend it for the completionists of this series or fans of the Loki show.</p>

The accessories are helpful and uncommon pieces, but not near the first choices anyone would pick for Sylvie from the 2021 hit Marvel series Loki. The new hair piece is very welcome.</p>

<p>However, the face print features a weirdly happy face. Those who watched the series know that this character rarely smiles.</p>

<p>Stupidly, Lego made the other face an even happier grin. This may be based on LEGO only having seen concept art (the torso is accurate) but I find that unlikely based on the release window.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego tried to redeem this figure with the dualmolded+printed arms, but we will not be fooled.</p>
