<p><i>What If...?&nbsp;</i>is certainly an interesting series, bringing us unique variations of our favorite characters. In this case, we have Spider-Man as the Sorcerer Supreme. I wasn&#39;t incredibly excited for this one, but I am glad I got it as it is easily the most detailed Spider-Man figure we&#39;ve ever received.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Spidey comes with his classic comic outfit, this time layered with more detail. The front and back of his torso are decked out with printing. There is printing on the sides of the arms and on the sides of the legs, as well as dual-molded legs. The new Spider-Man head isn&#39;t anything special, but it does look great, especially with the silver printed on it to give it a &#39;shiny&#39; appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Doctor Strange cloak is also included, but I question why they didn&#39;t introduce the new cloak mold here instead of in the NWH sets. It looks great nonetheless.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Spidey comes with his iconic web and nothing else. I don&#39;t believe any other accessories were necessary, although they would&#39;ve been welcome. The web is nice though, as it gives everyone easier access to one of these pieces for a small price.</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>The intricate printing all over this figure certainly enhances its value, as does the web which provides some playability. For $5, this is sure to please fans of all ages. Kids can get their hands on a great Spidey minifig, and adults can display this fig next to their other Spider-Man merchandise.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>While this figure certainly isn&#39;t my favorite, there is still a lot to love here. The high quality of the minifigure in general is certainly something that everyone can appreciate, and it makes the price bump to $5 feel more reasonable. I would&nbsp;<em>strongly</em>&nbsp;recommend this figure to any Spider-Man fans and also to anyone who appreciates high quality LEGO figures.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2021-09-11T20:49:42.803Z","Zombie Hunter Spider-Man: Review and Feel Guide!","<p>Introduction: Welcome back to another CMF review and feel guide!&nbsp;As we continue to go through the Marvel Studios Collectible Minifigure Series, we now look at Zombie Hunter Spider-Man! We&#39;ve already looked at Scarlet Witch, Loki, and Zombie Cap in my previous reviews, and you could say that the bar as been set high for this series. All of them have such an extreme level of detail, it&#39;s difficult to choose one as a favorite out of them all. This figure might appear as just another Spidey, but in my opinion, it is our best Spider-Man yet. Get ready for a rocking review, or feel free to skip to the final paragraph which is a feel guide on how you could feel out this figure yourself. And as always, if you feel like this review was helpful, please let me know down below, it&#39;s really encouraging to know that these are helping others, and it encourages me to keep on writing, but all of that aside, let&#39;s begin!</p>

<p>Hair: There&#39;s a hairpiece that comes with the second head, and it&#39;s a really nice brown laid back hairpiece. I believe this piece debuted in the Harry Potter minifigure series a few years back, and it would work well for Peter Parker, but they really messed up on his face printing.</p>

<p>Heads: That wasn&#39;t a typo, there are two heads with this figure, something completely unique to Spidey, and there were originally a few theories about the second head, but we&#39;ll touch on that next. This first head is kind of a bit overly shiny. It doesn&#39;t work for me, and I miss the Homecoming Spidey head. Nonetheless, this head works. It&#39;s much better than the second head. This second head is meant to be a depiction of Peter Parker. However, it&nbsp;was originally theorized that this was Scott Lang&#39;s disembodied head. LEGO confirmed it was not when they had pictures of Peter Parker maskless, proving this head was indeed not Ant-Man&#39;s. I kind of wish it was, because I don&#39;t like how LEGO depicts the MCU Peter Parker at all. I get that the face printing looks slightly similar to the &ldquo;What if...?&rdquo; Peter Parker, but come on LEGO, look at Tom Holland&#39;s face for once! It&#39;s unacceptable to me that we continue&nbsp;obsessively getting inaccurate heads for Peter Parker. I don&#39;t like the two faces we got, and I hope LEGO gets things under control here soon. Thankfully, Peter Parker&#39;s face never shows up in the revealed No Way Home sets, it&#39;s covered with the Spidey mask, as it should be. No child out there is all like, &ldquo;Hey mom, I really hope I got a Peter Parker minifigure!&rdquo;, they want a Spider-Man! It&#39;s unacceptable that LEGO keeps messing this up, and also, no kid should have to &ldquo;hope&rdquo; they got a certain minifigure, because I&#39;ll be reviewing this entire series, and giving feel guides for every character, that way you know who you get. Sorry for the self advertising, onto the Cape!</p>

<p>Cape: I promise this is my last negative thing to say about this figure, the cape really is a disappointment. It&#39;s a nice addition, but the cape doesn&#39;t behave the way it does in the pictures. It&#39;s two separate cape pieces, instead of being one piece like it was originally in the past sets. Making it two separate pieces prohibits the cape from tightly sticking up like it&#39;s supposed to, or at least that was the way my figure was. Spidey didn&#39;t even wear the cape in the show for more than maybe a minute. I get why LEGO had it here, they couldn&#39;t have a plain Spider-Man figure randomly thrown in the series, but it also could have been a zombie variant of someone completely different. I&#39;m not certain why Spider-Man had to be in the series, but the Torso and Legs do make this into a great figure.</p>

<p>Torso: This Torso is based off of the Avengers Campus Spidey suit, A.K.A the suit showcased in the zombie episode, so it is very accurate. Overall, I appreciate the many details included here on the front and back of this exceptional torso. There&#39;s the faint outline of Spidey&#39;s muscles and then hundreds of lines showcasing what a technological suit it is. The colours work majestically well, and this is where I begin to love the minifigure. This is in my opinion the best Spidey we have ever got. The illustrious colours work so well, and make the character iconic. This character comes with arm printing as well, really rounding out this amazing torso. This arm printing includes the details of a web shooter, something we have never got on a minifig before, as well as web cartridges on the torso almost like a belt. I certainly appreciate these details, and I know most Marvel fans will love it too.</p>

<p>Legs: The colours and printing from the torso carry over very well onto these legs, and these legs also feature spectacular side printing as an extra detail that makes him pop as a real Spidey should. Once again we have the technological lines and creases in a darker blue going over the lighter blue. I think this was bold of LEGO to do, considering every MCU Spidey has been done in a dark blue, this light blue is different, but dare I say, even better.</p>

<p>Accessory: Spidey comes with a web line piece that has been popular with Spidey since the original Sam Raimi trilogy as an accessory for the webslinger. I never had any of those sets, but I recall having fun with this piece when it came in the Ultimate Spider-Man sets. I really like this piece, especially considering that the more of it you have, the longer the web can be, and because of that, I would say this minifigure is probably one of the best to get multiple of. The &ldquo;What If...?&rdquo; Episode did prominently feature Spidey swinging around, so this accessory is a good addition accuracy-wise, but I could think of some other things he could have come with, such as a phone with perhaps a reference to the tutorial joke in the show, or maybe even giving him Scott Lang&#39;s head in a jar. I feel like either of those would&#39;ve been hilarious, and could have made this figure that much better. What they did was fine too, and I appreciate seeing the webline pop up again with Spidey, as it remains iconic to me.</p>

<p>Feel Guide: So, you want a Zombie Hunter Spidey for yourself? Here&#39;s how I recommend finding him. I&#39;ve heard many people advise feeling for two heads, but in my opinion, that really is risky to bet on considering Monica&#39;s accessory. I found him through his webline. There&#39;s nothing else in the series like the webline, and it can take mere seconds to find in one of those pesky blind-bags.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Overall, the good things about this figure outweigh the bad. It&#39;s hard to find things to not like in this series, but the heads&nbsp;and the cape really do stick out as poor decisions, despite it though, I would say Spidey is among the best in the series, the best being Captain America, White Vision, Loki, and Zombie Cap. Speaking of White Vision and Captain America, keep an eye out for reviews on both of them coming soon. Sorry, this review took a bit longer to write, as understandably, this was a figure there was a lot to say about. As always, if you enjoyed this review, or found the feel guide helpful, I&#39;d appreciate it if you let me know by saying you enjoyed it down below, and as always to all of you, keep on rocking!</p>

"normanpricecom","2021-09-25T19:04:09.25Z","Wonderful set","<p>This set is one of the greatest Spider-Man mini figure of all time. Possibly the best. Its arm printing is highly detailed with the un-common Web-Shooters and the common pattern. The body is well detailed to with a spider in the middle, Much like the on from Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home. The legs are highly detailed too, with the common red and blue markings. The head is printed well with a grey and black outline around the eyes. The back of the head is the usual lines. The web is the usual white long web piece with clips and pieces of rope. The cape is the cloak of levitation that Dr Strange usually wears and the stand is the common black stand with two action posing stand pieces.&nbsp;</p>
