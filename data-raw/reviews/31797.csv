Today we look at Zombie Cap in all his gory glory! This minifigure was definitely one of the most anticipated of the series, so maybe you want it too? Stick around until the end, and I&#39;ll give you some tips on how to feel out this remarkable figure from those pesky blind-bags, and as always, if you enjoyed this review and feel guide, I&#39;d appreciate it if you said you enjoyed it down below. It&#39;s just always encouraging to see that people are reading these reviews, and it&#39;s encourages me to continue writing these! So, with all of that said, let&#39;s get rocking with our review!</p>

<p>The Helmet: We&#39;ll start this review at the top and work our way down! So we have this helmet piece that we have been getting since the 2019 Avengers Endgame sets. At first, I always thought of this piece as too bulky, and unrealistic, but since then, I have grown to accept this piece as topping of Captain America. It does not disappoint in topping of this Captain America here. Also, a bonus for the helmet piece is that you get the pure Zombie head beneath it without any helmet printing defining it. This helmet differs from the one that comes with all other recent Steve Roger Captain America minifigures, as it has tattered details all around it giving it a worn out look. I love it on this figure, and it would definitely look good on a purist custom for Cap&#39;s Endgame final battle suit.</p>

<p>The Head: I mentioned the head a little bit in the last paragraph, but let&#39;s still talk about it. This Minifigure was done in a clever way so that this head can be used on any other Marvel figures to make them Zombified too. It&#39;s lifeless yellow eyes and sinking jaw bone are shockingly included here by LEGO as we get an accurate version of Zombie Cap straight out of the recent episode. LEGO went as far here as putting details on the back of the head, with a scar and hole. These details remain covered by the helmet, but if this head were to be used on a different figure, it could be seen. It&#39;s a stretch, but if you put this head with Zombie Hunter Spidey&#39;s hairpiece, you can see the scar. I know that doesn&#39;t make any sense because Spidey wasn&#39;t ever Zombified, but it just goes to show that this head can definitely be reused on other figures.</p>

<p>The Torso: Here we begin to see LEGO really dive in to details for this character. The suit looks to have originally been the Endgame suit for Cap that LEGO had in their Avengers Headquarters set that came out this year. This isn&#39;t necessarily accurate to the timeline of this episode of &ldquo;What if...?&rdquo;, but this look at the suit does match what we see in the episode. You would expect it to be based off of the Civil War suit, but this look works well too. The torso is almost like the perfect Captain America suit that keeps getting interrupted with rips and scars all over it. I personally think it really works as it doesn&#39;t have matching arm printing like you see with every other figure in the series, and it looks like LEGO put effort into a figure fans would all love and appreciate. The one arm&nbsp;has exposed Zombie flesh, while the other arm still has half of its sleeve left. The back printing is also exceptional as it continues to provide each terrifying detail that makes this figure a great Zombie figure, and more importantly a great Marvel figure.</p>

<p>The Legs: The leg printing carries very well off of the torso, and I know everyone will appreciate the separately dual molded legs. One leg loses its boot completely and has exposed Zombie flesh on the foot. This has wonderful printing stretching to the side as well with little details and holes in his leg. The opposite leg is still mostly covered, it has one tear where a pocket would be, and it has what looks like Zombie blood on his boot. If LEGO keeps making such detailed figures with such elegant side leg printing for this price, they are going to put all custom figure companies out of business. Which, is sad for them, but excellent news to LEGO Marvel fans, both sides have completely different details, they don&#39;t mirror each other in any way, which works for this character. I love how you can look at the back of this minifig&nbsp;and still be able to see that the legs are different. It&#39;s just an unparalleled minifigure and the legs continue to make it better.</p>

<p>The Accessories: Zombie Cap comes with one accessory, his shield. I have grown to really like LEGO&#39;s new shield piece, and to get such detailed printing on this piece in this series makes me really happy. Much like the helmet, this continues the trend of making a more rugged version of an already established piece. I really like the scratched look it has, and it could definitely double as an endgame shield in future sets. I was disappointed in the Avengers Compound Cap having a normal unscathed shield, when if LEGO wanted to be accurate, it should have been broken, or at least dirtier. What other accessories could they have given Zombie Cap? Well... none that would have been kid friendly, hats for sure. They pretty much had to just give him the shield, it&#39;s really the most accurate accessory.&nbsp;I loved the Zombie &ldquo;What if&hellip;?&rdquo; episode, and I know that it&#39;s still pretty new, so I won&#39;t get into spoilers, but for those who have seen the episode, they know who else in this CMF series they could give the shield to. Maybe even give him Loki&#39;s hair to make it really accurate.</p>

<p>The Feel Guide: So, you want to find a Zombie Cap for yourself? Here are some tips. This figure is really straight forward, probably a bit too straight forward to really distinguish him in those blind-bags. I found him by pushing what I thought was Bucky&#39;s hair piece into the corner, in which I discovered it was the helmet piece instead. Make sure you feel for&nbsp;the shield too, or else you might mistake Sylvie&#39;s hair for the helmet piece instead.</p>

<p>Conclusion: So that rounds out my review and feel guide of this remarkable Minifigure. I was not originally interested in Zombie Cap, just because I assumed he wouldn&#39;t make much of an addition uf he never appeared again after the show, but I think a part two of the Zombie episode is pretty much demanded, and even if not, his spectacular detail makes up for it. Who&#39;s the best minifigure in the series? The jury&#39;s still out on that. I think that it&#39;s definitely between Loki, Zombie Cap, Captain America, and Zombie Hunter Spider-Man. Speaking of good old Spidey, I&#39;ll be reviewing him tomorrow so keep an eye out for it. I hope that this review and feel guide was helpful to you, and as always, keep on rocking!</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-10-19T11:28:34.97Z","A figure with loads of printing, reusable parts, and in general one of the best based on looks alone!","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Zombie Captain America was in &ldquo;What if...?&rdquo; Episode five &ldquo;What if Zombies!? &ldquo; And his appearance may have been brief, but you&#39;ve got to say it was pretty cool just like this CMF.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helmet is the same helmet introduced in 2019 with new great printing such as: dirt marks and a bite mark on one of the side feathers, the head is light aqua with a zombiefied face print to match the episode, the torso has a tattered print, the arms and hands are mismatched with both arms adorning rips and dirt printed, the legs are very detailed as each leg is dual moulded in a different colour with one having light aqua and the other having dark red, both have side and feet printing.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory included is his shield, which does seem to be a recurring theme in this CMF series, which is printed amazingly, it is somewhat reminiscent of the &ldquo;Avengers: Endgame&rdquo; shield (from the final battle), just obviously lacking the halved aspect, the scratches and dirt print also look great. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with the DC superheroes CMF series route of including a black 1&times;1 jumper and the action pose piece which is also very effective.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a fantastic figure, a common statement made with the Marvel CMF series, the pieces are reusable for a battle damaged Steve Rogers and the pieces are reusable for a zombie and &ldquo;What if...?&rdquo; based dioramas, overall another great figure from a great series, only nine more to go!&nbsp;</p>
