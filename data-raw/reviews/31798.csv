<p>Captain Carter is a character introduced in Marvels Disney+ original, &ldquo;What if...?&rdquo; Episode 1 What if Agent Carter got the Super Soldier Serum? &ldquo; And is one of the best figures from what may be the greatest CMF series ever made.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hair piece is a new mould in dark brown that is perfect for a non &#39;Captain&#39; version of Peggy, a smiling and aggressive head which has a fantastic resemblance to the live action and animated character, a fantastically detailed torso print with accompanying printed arms and great dual moulded legs with the printing wrapping around the sides.</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include her shield printed with the Union Jack front and centre and two 1&times;1 frosted blue plates for probably the best Tesseract they have done to date. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with the same feature as the 2020 DC superheroes CMF series where a 1&times;2 black jumper is included along with the action pose piece which is quite effective.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is an absolutely fantastic figure with no flaws whatsoever, the arms and legs are useful for Captain America and the hair and head are useful for regular Agent Carter figures, although in an unorthodox manner there wasn&#39;t a spare action pose piece, but that is no big loss at all, therefore I highly recommend this figure as &ldquo;What if...?&rdquo; Is shaping up to be perhaps the best of the Marvel Disney+ series released this year.</p>

<p>Captain Carter was a standout character in <i>What If...?</i>, so it makes perfect sense to get her in a minifigure. I am incredibly surprised by the quality of this figure, especially when compared to the crappy figure that came in the Hydra Stomper set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Captain Carter features a new hairpiece which&nbsp;<em>perfectly</em>&nbsp;matches her hairstyle in the show. The mould is incredibly detailed and can even be used for your own 50s display. Her face also matches Hayley Atwell&#39;s likeness with incredible accuracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her torso has the iconic Union Jack, and the arm printing is an especially nice detail. Her legs feature side printing and dual-molding, which both look great and can even be used for upgrading your own Captain America minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Peggy comes with the shield, this time with a Union Jack printed on it. It looks good, but I&#39;ve found that the print is often off-center.</p>

<p>The Tesseract is also included, this time in that neat light blue with sparkles. It looks very pretty, and it is finally size accurate. Both of Peggy&#39;s accessories fit the character well and are just good accessories in general.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>This figure obviously has a lot of display value for $5, especially since it can be paired with the Hydra Stomper. It has stunning amounts of detail, and it is also a fun figure to play with. Little kids can reenact their favorite&nbsp;scenes from the show. This figure&#39;s definitely worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I feel very strongly about this figure; it&#39;s amazing in every way. I have no complaints and I recommend you go out and get this figure (along with the rest of the series of course).</p>
