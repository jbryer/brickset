<p>To be honest, this was my least favorite of the minifigures in this series since the beginning. I don&#39;t feel any particular connection to this figure, and the pieces aren&#39;t too interesting or usable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Starting at the top, we have a newly printed Gamora hair. It&#39;s not very different from the previous one, but it&#39;s welcome nonetheless. Her face print looks great as well, even if it is incredibly similar to the prior versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her torso and leg prints are slightly altered from those that come with Thanos in the Sanctuary II set. Sadly though, there is no side leg printing, something that I&#39;ve come to expect from this series, especially with the incredible detail on the torso, legs, and arms. Speaking of those arms, they&#39;re dual-molded with incredible gold and black printing applied on top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This figure as a whole looks great, even if it is missing some printing on the side of the legs.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>The only accessory here is Thanos&#39; double-edged sword. It is slightly disappointing tht we have no new piece to represent the iconic blade, especially as this figure incorporates no new molds. It looks fine, but I would&#39;ve wished for at least 1 new element in this figure.</p>

<p>Each figure in this series has a small posing piece, which allows for some great dynamic poses.</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>I feel as though this series is the first to really make the $5 you pay for these figures worth it. The detail on this figure is spectacular, and it&#39;s unbelievable that my least favorite figure in the series is&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;good. However, it is worth nothing that there aren&#39;t too many pieces that are usable outside of this context.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>While it&#39;s great to get a detailed Gamora figure for very cheap, I personally don&#39;t like this figure. Gamora has never been my favorite character and I&#39;m not interested in what she&#39;s going to do in <em>What If...?</em>. My opinion may change by the time the episode comes out, and I still think this is an incredible figure. I&#39;d recommend this to anyone who wants to get a cheap Gamora figure.</p>
