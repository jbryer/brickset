<p>War Machine is a character with a very cool comic/film design, and Lego have done a good job over the years capturing that but this figure from 76153 Avengers Helicarrier is probably the best ,however compromises were made.</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The helmet is the invincible Iron Man helmet from 2017 introduced in that set with Agent Coulson with appropriate War Machine printing , his head has a smiling face and a stern one with the red heads up display printed , he has the Outrider neck attachment with a stud shooter attached on his right and a stack of roller skate pieces in black to represent some kind of shooty thingy , his torso has very nice printing, and it flows&nbsp;nicely into the legs.</p>

<p>The accessories and stand-</p>

<p>His accessories are two trans red 1&times;1 studs for thrust on his hands and his stand is two trans red 1&times;1 cylinders for more thrust attached to a 3&times;3 trans red dish for stability.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a great figure however the set version came with a lot more including the &#39;power blast and splat&#39; pieces instead of some studs and cylinders, and he had some support thrusters on the back attachment&nbsp; , however for a magazine this is a great figure, so I recommend it , also the next marvel one is rather exciting being Iron Spider from the venomosaurs set.</p>
