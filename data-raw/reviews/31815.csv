Although I absolutely adore this set because the architecture is incredible and the aesthetics are perfect, it is not a particularly fun build. It is monotonous and only the fact that I could slowly seemy favourite stadium in the world taking shape kept me going. Now that it is finished, however, I adore it. It&#39;s a display piece and a display piece only as there simply is no way to really play with it. I plan on incorporating it into a large cityscape, but it will function as a distant stadium rather than something minifigures can really visit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a Bar&ccedil;a fan, you will not enjoy this set, but if you are, it is incredible, especially with the addition of the canalets set.</p>
