"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-10T15:30:06Z","a really bad set indeed...","I just cannot believe I bought this set at full price ($115 CDN). It's not even worth half! Probably the worst polic station. It is so hallow with hardly any detail. I tried making another alternative station, I only came up with an average good station. Probably the only good thing about this set, is that it fits in very tight spaces. Since my town doesn't have a lot of space, in a way this station was perfect on a curve piece. I would strongly recommend the newer police station from World City. There isn't any good in this set. The interior is very...well empty. There is only a 2x4 red brick here and there with maybe a computer, or a glass on it. It is very poorly designed and no way a 200 piece set is worth 100 bux Canadian!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T22:19:46Z","Ten, not 1 and 3","This set is wicked and despite what others say it is fun to play with and there wouldn't be a town without it. The jail is cool and the headquaters is wicked. It was my major police set and has a great playability value. Although it is a bit flimsy it is still great to play with.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-17T14:36:49Z","ok but dont recomend it","THis was ,and still is, my only police station.I am glad to have A police station.It is missing some things but it isn't too bad.It is pretty junorized,unfortunitly,the glass and the panels are very simple.I have been able to use the pieces though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-12T01:39:26.763Z","Pretty unrewarding.","This set is pretty much standard late 1990s Lego Town fare - lots of useful little pieces such as equipment, pre-printed bricks and plates, etc, but dumbed down beyond belief.  The vehicles are okay, come with unusual pieces (such as the helicopter's cockpit).  But the building is just all big pieces and over-simplistic design, quite the least impressive Lego police station by far.  Not as bad as some late-90s town sets but still not worth the money.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-06T05:38:25.533Z","LEGO Town (Police) - Command Post Central Review","This is a great set to have and my favourite LEGO police station as well. The built of each model is very easy and we don't get any stickers to worry about. We get lot's of stuff like a helicopter, a motorcycle, a jeep, a jail, a small building and a bigger building. The windscreen of the helicopter opens very easily and the blades sviwel full 360Â°. I also like the way how LEGO did the engines on the back of the helicopter. The jeep has a trunk on the back which you can open if you want to store something in there. The motorcycle has some lights on the back, walkie-talkie and a red megaphone.<br><br>The jail has a gate which you can open very easily but it's a little bit difficult to put the criminal in there. On the ceiling of the jail you can see a light and a camera which sviwels. On the top of the garage is also a platform where the cops can guard the prisoner. The small building has a radar and an antenna on the top and a place where you can store some accessories on the first level. The second level has an office and a door which opens. We also get a bridge which looks very nice. The bigger building has two doors on the front which you can open and an office on the first level. We also get an office in the second and third level. In one level you also get two reward signs. On the top of the building you can also find a platform for the helicopter and the second level also has a bridge. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have. It's also a great set to add to any LEGO city.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"legolooney123","2010-01-01T08:05:22.09Z","One of my favourite sets","I was shocked to find this set had such a low score.

I remember asking for this weeks and weeks before christmas.

It has great playablilty, design minifigures and you can create a variety of different police stations using the green windows.

With so many vehicles and figures i used to play with this for hours.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"polarscribe","2014-03-19T00:29:13.22Z","An awful reminder of LEGO's juniorized era","<p>A juniorized abomination. To think that this was the followup to Central Precinct HQ and Metro PD Station, two of the most detailed and expansive&nbsp;1990s LEGO buildings.</p>

<p>This... thing... on the other hand, was made up of a handful of giant wall panels and ghastly green windows. There is remarkably little interior detailing and no sense of organization.</p>

<p>To pick out one glaring flaw among many - the &quot;jail&quot; consists of a single chair in a wall-panel box&nbsp;<strong>without even an operating door.</strong>&nbsp;To access the cell, one must &quot;hand of God&quot; un-stud a three-stack of jail bars plunked in the front opening. Never before or since was a police station designed with this incomprehensible level of laziness.</p>

<p>In fact, 1983&#39;s 6384 Police Station had a more sophisticated design and higher build quality than this set - marking a 15-year journey *backward* into the depths of design disaster.</p>
