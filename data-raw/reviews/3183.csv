"Mr_Dunlop","2007-12-16T06:09:01.263Z","Simple but effective","This set isn't very customisable, and doesn't contain any really contain any exclusive pieces, but this is still a nice little set, ecspecially entertaining for younger Lego-lovers, as the light weight of the vehicles makes for easy car chases.

Overall, this set isn't very memorable, slightly dull, in my opinion only. Hovever, for it's playability, which I can still sort of remember enjoying, it gets half marks - 3/10.

P.S. This is was U.S. only, but I bought mine in an Australian Toys &quot;R&quot; Us nearly a year after it's recorded release.
