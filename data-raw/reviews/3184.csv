The buoys look very simple as well.

The trailer of the truck can be removed very easily and the truck has a very cool design as well. The antenna on the back can sviwel and the vehicle is very easily to maneuver as well. The building looks very awsome as well. I really love the colors on it and we also get a palm tree witha nice looking parrot on the top of it. I really can't complain about this model.<br></span></p>

"jatonaz","2011-02-16T21:54:19.93Z","Casual set that can be beat by the casual MOCer.","<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the new 2011 Harbour&nbsp;theme coming out, I thought I'd rebuild and&nbsp;review the old Leisure&nbsp;seaside set. It looks like it'd go along well with the 2011 Marina set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I could go on and blabber about how it's always emergency rescue sets, and city life set&nbsp;are so so so rare, but you knew that already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minifigs&nbsp;include two of your basic Town race-themed looking guys with vest&nbsp;plus printed helmets, and a Paradisa-looking referee guy. All three have the old life vests. I like the lifeguard, with the Harbour sign on his chest. Nothing special, but good additions to your city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get some printed pieces and some stickers. A tree and parrot, checkered flag (printed), fences, and red roof are the useful elements here. Everything else you already have or aren't really useful else where.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three main parts to the build. The jeep and tow, the coast guard booth, and the three water vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jeep is your everyday mid 90s four-stud jeep, if you know what I mean. Back then, these were the cookie-cutter models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coast guard booth is simple, and builds exactly like it looks. You might not even need the instructions for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water jetskis are a pretty good resemblance to the real thing. Though built in&nbsp;just over&nbsp;10 bricks, the have that sleek feel to them. The referee's boat is another cookie-cutter model of the Town ships. Nothing special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me and the AFOLs I know, City/Town sets are more to be displayed in a diorama than played with,&nbsp;so to me this catagory is negligible.To kids however, this set carries ships that are swooshable even with little hands,&nbsp;which is&nbsp;a good play design. Two competitors and even a ref makes it fun and realistic. An extra brick on the score if for&nbsp;kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp;an inventory mainly consisting of&nbsp;easily obtained elements, there is really no need to pay over the original price of USD$20 for this set. If you are a collector, maybe $25 with box and instruction. No more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A casual set with a casual build. It can add some spice and color to your city beach, but you don't neccessarily have to get this set to do so. Use it as an inspiration and I'm sure even most MOC beginners can pull out something better.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"Harmonious_Building","2012-01-31T20:56:25.22Z","Wave Race '96","<div>In spite of having come out in the mid-90s, there’s something about Wave Jump Racers that feels distinctly modern, and yet, at the same time, it does maintain a certain simplicity that makes it feel very classical, too. For one reason or another, I’ve always found the mid-90s Leisure subtheme to be a pretty attractive and coherent one overall, and I do think that Wave Jump Racers is a good representative of the line.</div><div><br></div><div>Four Minifigs and four vehicles is pretty good for a $20 set, not to mention the beachfront booth that you get for a judge or spectator. The primary draw for this set, in my mind, would be the sheer number of vehicles that you get to help in populating and fleshing out a beachfront scene, because what’s a beach without boats, after all?</div><div><br></div><div>The two speedboats pretty much have identical builds, one that is, in turn, replicated in Water Jet (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6517-1"">6517</a>), which is an essential impulse buy to have along with this set should you decide to get it. Both are cursed with an annoying set of (triangular!) stickers, but the builds are pretty cool for their size and effectively convey the feel of a streamlined water jet cruising through the sea. It’s also nice that the two racers are very distinct from each other, although, unfortunately, you’ll have to shell out extra for hair should they decide to take a break and remove their helmets. The “referee” boat is a little less cool, a sturdy but not very pretty boat that is clearly not meant for racing under any circumstances, but it does provide a nice bit of realism for folks recreating scenes of their own races. Why this mustachioed escapee from the Paradisa line is refereeing the race is beyond me, but he’s a functional enough Minifig who will doubtlessly add a bit more life to your LEGO beach.</div><div><br></div><div>The jeep is cool as well, featuring a simple SNOT design that was common for the time. The speedboats fit very snugly on the trailer attached the jeep without being difficult to remove, which adds for further playability for those who are so inclined. The driver has the standard coast guard outfit which is common enough since one also comes with Baja Buggy (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6518-1"">6518</a>).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The refereeing station is nothing in particular to write home about, and it will easily integrate itself into your beach as well. The sloped red roof is a particularly nice touch, but, unfortunately, this waterfront shack suffers from the highly offensive disease of having one sticker covering two bricks, as evidenced by the coast guard logo in the front. This will probably make people angry for decades to come, and while I don’t recall being angry about it when I was a kid, I would probably be angry about it now, which goes to show that adults have everything the wrong way round.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So I do like this set, so much so that I would consider buying it again if I ever get over my irrational fear of having a beach scene as a part of my town. If you own any of the more contemporary City marinas, you may want to consider bringing this classic back on board to add some more flavour to your town’s waterfront. It’s pretty unique; you won’t be disappointed.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
