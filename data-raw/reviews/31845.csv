"Naylor_Chief","2021-12-06T08:51:21.51Z","I've waited 30 years for this set. ","<p>Obviously I&#39;m a fan of Lego but since being a kid I&#39;ve always had a fascination with the Titanic. So when this set came around it was always going to be purchased but would have a lot to live up to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my opinion it has lived up to those expectations. Thoroughly enjoyed this build and the little touches were fantastic. It&#39;s a BIG model but for me, it had to be. I&#39;d have happily had it even bigger (although the wallet wouldn&#39;t have).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would have been nice to have a couple of Minifigures of maybe Caption Smith, Andrews and Ismey to stand with the name plate but still, it&#39;s no loss without them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would go as far as to say this is the best set in my collection. Looks amazing (photos don&#39;t do it justice), so enjoyable to build and if you&#39;re a fan of Titanic and/or Lego then you will love this.&nbsp;</p>

"gorf43","2022-02-15T05:03:08.033Z","The best set ever? ","<p>What makes a great set? Well, pretty much everything about this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, if you&#39;re short on cash, I honestly cant recommend that you buy this set. But if you&#39;ve got the Lego money for it, buy it now. Now, I bought this set with my own money. Im fortunate enough to have a great&nbsp;life (compared to most) and I have money to spare. But I work hard for it. Ten hour days in the pouring rain or blazing sun isn&#39;t easy. But even with my fortunate money situation, this set is still extremely expensive! But Id say in a heartbeat its worth it! Those long hard days honestly seem worth it once you&#39;ve got this set. Besides, I don&#39;t buy into the whole thing of &quot;Lego is overpriced!&quot; Lego is simply an expensive hobby, and for a hobby,&nbsp;this set is fairly priced. So&nbsp;if you&#39;re short on cash, stick with smaller sets or save up. But if you&#39;ve got Lego money saved up, you wont be disappointed with your purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Display:</p>

<p>Its a beautiful set. I mostly buy Star Wars which ends up being a lot of grey. This set just has a vibrant colour scheme. Dark red, white, tan, yellow and black really spice up a room. The detail is also astounding! I wasn&#39;t expecting such quality. It looks like a &quot;real&quot; model ship. Railings, rope, cranes, benches, ladders, hatches, vents, and lifeboats bring the deck to life. Its far from being a boring display set. Not to mention the interior builds which although hidden, are fun to build and its just fun to know that they&#39;re there. (If you had friends, I suppose you could impress them by opening it up and being like: &quot;Ah, yes, and here we have the...&quot;) The main reason I haven&#39;t bought the Falcon is because of its sheer size in all directions. This set is much easier on space, being fairly shallow. Meaning it can be out of the way, yet on full display, on a simple shelf. You could also display it from all sides on a coffee table, but the truth is, most don&#39;t have that space. So, it looks amazing, and its quite easy to display without taking up your entire home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>So this is something I don&#39;t talk about lots for two reasons. Im more of a collector, I get my enjoyment from this hobby by putting my completed sets in a nice display. I do enjoy building them, but Id say Im happier once they&#39;re in just the right place on display. Another reason is (Im not bragging I promise!) Im a skilled builder. I finish sets quickly and easily. A quick peek at the page, and the step is done. I don&#39;t thrive on the build process. But this set was different. Being the biggest set ever, it takes more than a couple evenings to finish. In that amount of time, you start to develop a connection with the set. Its always there, every night you add a little more, and when its finally done, you find yourself wandering into your Lego room and the lack of a half built set feels out of the ordinary. I honestly missed this set once it was done, I wanted to keep building it for longer! Ive never felt that way about a set before. Its a good feeling. This set might be the one that converts me to someone who buys a set for the build as well as the display. (Would be useful, Id basically be getting twice my moneys worth.) And this set is fresh! Yes its a lot of money, but a huge, extremely accurate model ship isn&#39;t like anything Legos done before.Its by far my favourite build for several reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>18+. Does if finally make sense?</p>

<p>I think age ratings are stupid. Who is Lego to tell customers what set they can and cannot buy?&nbsp;I honestly couldnt care less, never have, never will, and Legos newest 18+ theme just amused me to no end. We all know what &quot;adult&quot; means, even if Lego apparently doesnt. Anyways, maybe this is a set that deserves it. I think it does. (If we HAVE to have &quot;adult&quot; sets.) It is a complex build, even for a skilled builder. The price is most certainly adult. The topic is mainly enjoyed by adults. There is not detail left out, it is a set for collectors. It, once completed, is purely a display set. I still don&#39;t like the whole 18+ thing, but this is definitely the kind of set it should go with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>Its my favourite set, and with the exception of price for most people, it is one of the greatest sets ever. Its iconic, and not fleetingly so. The Titanic is a modern legend and always will be. Pop culture will sell more sets faster, but the Titanic doesn&#39;t depend on that type of thing. Its an excellent display set, easy to do so, and looks great. Its fun to build. Mildly complex, not like Technic, but it still has a side of challenge to it. It doesn&#39;t have playability, but I don&#39;t think most people interested in this set are too concerned about that. The ONLY problem is price. As I said, I don&#39;t have to think twice about buying this, but most do. I think that if you&#39;ve got Lego money waiting for a big purchase, this is the set for you. Unfortunately, any way you look at it, its a LOT of money, and for that, if you&#39;re even mildly concerned about enjoying it, don&#39;t buy it.&nbsp;So I don&#39;t think its overpriced, its just really expensive. And I think its worth it, every bit. It quickly became my new favourite set and it just might become yours too. Theres one more thing: It didn&#39;t come with an iceberg }:(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>

"norranradd","2022-04-04T15:20:15.68Z","I feel like the King of the World","<p>As a kid I had a fascination with the Titanic and I loved playing and building with legos. Little did I know that many years later that Lego would release a model of the Titanic. Two of things I loved, the Titanic and Lego. Once I saw the images for this set I knew I had to get it and build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once I got this set I was greeted with a very enjoyable building experience that I loved putting my time into. Seeing all the techniques and all the small details that were put into this set show how the designers really put pride and care into this set. There is no denying that this set is massive and looks great on display, I would recommend&nbsp;this set to anyone, but they definitely need to have room to display it since this set is just so massive. The price to piece count is accurate, and you get a lot of pieces as well as a fantastic looking model for what you are spending your money on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This maybe my first review but I just knew that this was the set that I had to tell people about because it is quite simply one of the best Lego sets ever designed. As long as you have the room and the time to build it I would say to go ahead and get it because you will not regret it.&nbsp;</p>
