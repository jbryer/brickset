"GuitarGod_Dave","2007-12-28T09:23:07.45Z","It is 1 of the BEST!","I got this ages ago &amp; it took my dad about 2 hours to build (i was two young at the time). But am glad it was built. It comes with a masive Cab &amp; Tralier, 3 F1 racing cars, 3 mini figs and more tools than you will ever need. It is perfect but should have come with extra fig for the cab. I love this &amp; is probobly my favorite set that i own. 

I will always keep it. Have had to rebuild it a few times and each time it was worth it. Mine dosent look its best at the moment as the stickers have been ripped and shreded. But i still love it.

The only bad thing is that when you put on the red things to help the cars get on, when you take them of it seems to take the trailer to bits. 

If ever you have the chance to get it. You should you will never regret it. Or if you have it build it! It is 1 of the BEST!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Zrath","2008-12-29T06:35:36.31Z","Greatest toy ever designed by Lego!","This is hands-down the greatest toy ever designed by Lego.
And by this I mean that the end result of assembling this set gives you a toy that is so awesome that you could sell it ready-made and it wouldn't matter that it's Lego!
 
The truck and trailer are brilliantly designed, with tons of features. The trailer contains a storage compartment with a complete set of tools plus handjack and handcart and even spare tires. Removable ramps let you unload the top cars. The trailer has retractable stabilizers so it can stand alone.
And you also get 3 race cars and 3 drivers.
I mean, seriously, what more could you want? (Except a truck driver figure, I mean)
 
I sold mine and it was a very painful thing to do.
If you own this, NEVER SELL IT!

"cbowers","2009-11-17T15:23:11.937Z","A classic Truck","I agree with previous posts about the value of this racing carrier. It is great in that it is actually pretty realistic. I like how you can load and unload the vehicles with the moving carrier pieces. This is by far one of the best Lego Semis as it is total pieces, and not those huge trailer beds that are on the new trucks. I wish they would revert back to more pieces for construction. I am tired of Lego's answer for everything is that they make them more appealing for kids to play with with bigger pieces. That is entirely untrue. 

I think it takes away from the brand as a whole. The creativity is diminished with such large pieces. A truck such as this does not take away from the brand and provides limitless possibilities of play by using the pieces provided in versatile ways to make different models. 

This truck has great playability with four total vehicles and is loaded with accessories. It is a perfect lego set for travel, because you do not need an entire city to play with it. A

It also fits in well with the newer wider trucks. So do the race cars. I'd like to see a race theme return. Just hope its not blocky and more piecey. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"gokerg","2010-04-08T13:55:37.06Z","Best set for the vehicle fans","This set is another set I really love. Since I'm a vehicle fan, I love the truck and cars. It also has 3 minifigures. It looks so nice. Nowadays, there is the 6753 Highway Transport which looks like this. It is a little bit bigger. I'll get that also. In this Indy Transport, you can find the repair tools, spare tyres, car lifter,... I really like this set. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Over the years (being a kid and not a collector) I lost most of the pieces, but this set really stuck out in my head. I started collecting Legos and I had to get this set again and thanks to ebay I did. I'm glad I did because this set is as fun as I remember it to be.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Three races cars and a truck with a trailer!<br>- Lots of accessories and three mini figures<br>- Lots of pieces (the build is fun and takes some time)<br>- Durable set<br>- Great Value<br><br>Cons:<br>- None<br><br>If you like Lego cars and trucks, this set should definitely be in your collection.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-23T04:31:03.69Z","LEGO Town (Racing) - Indy Transport Review","This set is a fun build and it has lot's of stuff to play with. We get a nice looking truck and 3 race cars. The race cars all have no stickers and look all the same - except for the colors. The rear wing of these cars is able to sviwel. The ceiling of the rig does open and the doors on each side open as well. The rig and the trailer both have stikers. The trailer itself can transport all of these 3 cars and there's also a ramp which you can slide out if you want to get the cars on the trailer. There's also a door on each side which you can open and in there you can find lot's of tools and extra tyres for the cars. It's a great set to have and it's fun to play with for sure.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"cityboy518ipswich","2011-04-18T13:42:43.11Z","A Proper Legend","<p>This could be the best town set lego have ever made. Relased in 1996 this racing car transporter features 397 pieces, three race cars and many accessories for repairs and pit stops. This set combined with set 6337 fast track finish and set 6546 slick racer will make a cool formula 1 racing scene with 6 cars, a finish line, a transporter, a towtruck, 10 minifigs although more could be added. The overall truck is very nice and will fit nicely into any town or city. I will now do in-depth reviews of the sets features.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set includes three minifigures. They have a hat and a helmet each which all have blue visors and they all have&nbsp;typical nineties faces. They are dressed in race suits, one guy has a white outfit with the octan logo and the words 'Race Team' printed on it. The guy in the red suit has the octan logo and the words 'Team 1 Racing' printed on it and the guy in the blue suit has the octan logo and the word 'Oil' printed on it. The newer generation of this torso is used in the 2010 'Tank Truck' set.The set could have included one more minifigure as the poor truck driver has to drive his truck many miles to get to the racetrack and then race his car for many more miles, and after that, he must be pretty tired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Formula 1 cars are built on the same chassis, and they're all red. They also use the same building technique and have slick tyres. They have numbers on the side slopes and they also have a spoiler and exhausts at the rear as well. This is in my opinion the best design of formula 1 car ever produced by lego. The sheer simplicity of the cars make&nbsp;it easy to build more of them. To build a good circuit you'd need the sets in the introduction as well as lots of baseplates, barriers and tan plates to create some gravel traps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set has many useful accessories, my favourites being the carjack which has not been in any recent sets and the hand trolley which has many uses. It also features 6 grey hand tools on a sprue. There is also two spare formula 1 slick wheels. The carjack comes in three pieces:the base, the handle and the lifter. My first carjack was bought off bricklink!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally we come onto the truck which has a great design,&nbsp;a brilliant ramp feature and large octan stickers. When I got the set for christmas 2010 the big octan stickers were missing but the rest were there. The cab uses 1x2 tiles with stud in middle to make it wider and uses the hinge roof which was popular in that era of town. It uses the typical classic town windscreen in trans light blue and the ramp uses the horse hitching cleverly so that when you lower it the ramp will drop and you can load the cars after attaching the long latticed red pieces, which have many uses. Then there's the amount of useful pieces contained within this set: panels, wheels, tiles, trans pieces,plates, the list goes on. There are I think two more trucks with this design, They are the shuttle launching crew and the Police surveilance truck. I own the shuttle launching crew. The truck can hold three cars and has a large storage compartment where you can store the jack, trolley, hand tools, spare wheels and helmets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This set is amazing, I would highly reccomend picking it up, you wont be dissapointed. It really is a proper legend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
