"Laoakai","2006-01-10T08:26:11Z","","I got this once in my Advent calendar. Every day some pieces and 1 or 2 sites of the instructions. That was very cool and i love this set. The helicopter is nothing special, because its a standard one, as used in many sets, but the truck with the trailer is just great!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The truck is nice and even has a sunroof on it, the only thing I don't like is I think two people should be able to fit in it not just one.  The trailer is super cool.  The helicopter can land on it and fit just perfectly for transportation.  There is also a sonar dish and computer on the trailer.  The dish is on a swivel but that's pretty much the only way it moves except folding down for transport.  The helicopter is just your basic copter nothing special.  

Here are the things that make the rating what it is

Pros:
+Great looking.
+Everything Fits together for transport.
+Two vehicles.
+Many cool pieces.

Cons:
-When Helicopter lands, the pilot has to sit in it while it is being moved, when he should be in the cab.
-needs a car or something to go with it maybe a motorcycle.
-no doors on truck.

Overall, this is a quality set and if you find it cheap, you should definitely get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-20T10:51:16.333Z","LEGO Town (Launch Command) - Launch Response Unit Review","This is a very fun set which I got. It may be an old set but it has some cool value in here. We also get a few stickers which you have to put on. I really like the design of that helicopter. The camera does sviwel and the cockpit opens very easily. The blades can sviwel full 360° as well. The truck itself has a cool design as well. The cockpit can be opened and you can put the driver in this truck. The trailer can be removed and on the back of the trailer is a computer. There's also a radar which sviwels full 360°. The helicopter can also land on this trailer. I think it's a great set to have and we also get two cool minifigs with this truck.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

Although when it gets to life-like practicality this set loses some points it makes up for them in playability...,<br><br>The set consists of a cool truck, (that seems to fit 2 minifig, but doesn't and has no doors), a helicopter (standard, cool usage of the antenna to hold the blades in place during transport) and a transport loading bed with a tracking dish on the back an room for the helicopter).<br><br>Also nice is the fact that once you found the space shuttle, (or the booster rockets) they fit on the flat-bed. (especially when you flip the red pieces at the end). The helicopter can in that case fly back to base on its own. <br><br>A big improvement to the 1992 transport set (6346)<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4
