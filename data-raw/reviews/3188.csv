"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-25T13:18:32Z","Great Coast guard HQ","I got this set for my birthday years ago. It's really great as many of the town sets from the 80s to mid 90's. It has a good design and a nice dolphin. The Building is a little bit empty but enough for a little Coast Guard HQ. The car has a little bit of strange design and lacks doors and has a too low windscreen, but it's not too boxy. The speedboat is very useful. Even if you don't use it as a rescue boat you can still modify it too a racing boat. And the Helicopter is just a beauty, but not very useful for rescuing persons. Oops I just forgot the gas pump by the helicopter landing pad.
Altough the car is a bit strange it's still a great 10/10 for this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-31T03:56:14.343Z","Coastal Rescue Base…","Having just got hold of one of these sets, I was very pleased to add this to my collection.   ‘Hurricane Harbor’ is a very attractive little set, which represents a typical coastal rescue base which can be found the length and breadth of many countries.   The set is presented in a cool white and blue colour scheme mounted on a grey platform with yellow pontoons complete with palm tree, three minifigs and a small patrol craft.   The main set comprises five parts:

The Base is quite sparse in appearance both internally and externally, although it should be noted that the base is not there to be a feat of architectural engineering; it is there to serve a purpose and provide a service.   The ground floor level interior features a coastal map; presumably this represents an electronic map used for tracking vessels along with compass.   In the small covered area adjacent to this room is a frame which holds a life preserve and a small handheld searchlight.   On the roof of this building is a public address speaker system and a radar dish mounted high on a bracket which can turn 360º and tilt backwards.   The main control room is located on the first floor of the structure.   This area houses a desk complete with tape recorder, lights, and a keyboard with monitor and a radar screen.   Mounted externally on this building is a bright red radio aerial on a bracket.

The Quayside features a vehicular access ramp in grey so that the base and mooring pontoons can be accessed.   The quayside adjacent to the ‘water’ area features mooring bollards, grey access ladders the transit of which are obscured by the coast guard sign, and ‘L’ shaped mooring pontoon complete with red handrail and plant!   Alongside the main building is the familiar Octan fuel pump with hose and nozzle and heli-pad with marker lights, while at the far end of the platform, a palm tree has grown.   Also provided is a dolphin, presumably for decorative purposes and perhaps to offer an indication of this location of the base (warm climates).

The Boat is a small white streamlined model and features a small forepeak with navigation lights and partly-enclosed cockpit area with windshield.   Aft of this area is a storage bracket for securing the handheld VHF radio and loudhailer.   Mounted on the transom is a grey bracket with handheld searchlight and red long range radio antenna which is in the raked back position. 

The Jeep is very utilitarian and is provided without doors, making a fast response possible.   The jeep, although basic, features lights front and back, a roll bar with high-mounted searchlights, there are also two mounting brackets which house a handheld VHF radio and a handheld searchlight.   Big wheels and good ground clearance make this a useful vehicle.

The Helicopter follows the same colour scheme and features a very small cockpit and single rescue line.   The fuselage is mounted on short grey skids, this means sea landings are not an option.   The tail boom features a blue fin with red marker light and rotor.   The main rotor is mounted on a bracket in the usual place.

There are a few niggles with this set in terms of its realism, such as a lack of life-saving equipment, lack of room on board the boat for rescuing persons in difficulty, and similar groans with the helicopter, it is very small and the cabin can only seat one minifig, this could so easily have be rectified as there is plenty of space on the platform for a larger heli-pad or it could even have been mounted on girders next to the main building.   These are minor niggles, but it is still a great set and addition to the coast guard line.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-08T08:02:29.45Z","LEGO Town (Coastguard) - Hurricane Harbour Review","This is an awsome set from the past. The build is very nice and easy and we also need to put on some stickers. We get lot's of stuff like a car, a boat, a helicopter, the harbour and a dolphin. The car looks very cool. I really love the design of this vehicle. I also like the boat. I haven't tried to do a floating test with this boat so I don't know if this will float. But I'm sure that it won't float on water. The blades of the helicopter sviwel full 360° and the windscreen can be moved up and down. We also get some sviwel headlights on the front and a string which you can move in and/or out.<br>The building itself comes with a radar which sviwels full 360°, a platform for the helicopter, a gas pump, a dock, a map and an office. I also like the big plates which LEGO is using for this harbour. It's a great set to have for sure!<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
