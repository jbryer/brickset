I have used this set for many years and I still enjoy building and creating different types of scenarios with this set. All of the pieces are very durable, and the set also withstands a lot of wear and tear. All in All this is a solid set and should be a welcome addition to anyone's collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-04T19:14:28Z"," Tis' the best Lego launch complex!","  This was one of my favorite sets! I love space legos, REALISTIC space legos. First, this set comes with a runway baseplate, a red launch tower, a space shuttle with SRB's and an ET, a crwaler vehicle, little office, and lots of classic minifigs. This is my review.....
          This set is pretty daggone expensive, we bought it for a bone-breaking 113$ USD on Bricklink, and I would say it almost is well worth the duckets. It comes with around 560 pieces (Plenty) and a unique box. Because this was a '95 European set, it has the good box and an awesome little lego mini-catalog. There are alot of large red pieces for the tower, which looks quite well if you ask me!!!  The spaceshuttle is very cool, and I like the astronaut dude, although it is a very boring head! ^*%#@  
   The spaceshuttle is wicked sturdy and has a cool robotic arm and air-supplier pack in the payload bay within. The bay doors open and close and the bottom holds the wheels, which I take off for launch to prevent serious drag!!!! The Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are nice and can disconnect and connect fairly easily, the External Tank (ET) is good too and uses a keen structure to make it up. Compared to the shuttle, the orbital booster system looks shrimpy, and I would think lego could make a larger model of them, but hell's-bells, atleast they included one!!!!! The crawler thing that they use to transport the shuttle is quite nice and the launch complex is just flat out beautiful! A smart 10! Get this bundle of legos now, it'll just smile at ya'!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I nagged my parents ears off, about how much I loved this set. I tryed to built this set, with all my own lego.. It didn't looked good and I wanted this set even more! And I got it! I was so happy!
The set is just lovely, I had lots of fun with it, and it is really good to play with. And the parts are very nice, expecially the red ones :)

"pythonkid","2005-07-19T23:31:53Z","I love this set","I got this way back when it first came out. It has been one of my favorite. I like this shuttle theme due to the realisticness. After having it for over 10 years, It has gotten a bit roughed up, and a few tools are missing, but I still enjoy it. I just really wish I got the shuttle recon set to go along with it. The only drawback I can see is that over time the white bricks start to turn ugly, and the tools can be easily lost. WI hope all who have ever gotten this set have taken care of it well.

Pros:
Shuttle
Mini-Figs
Booster and big Tank
Tower
Crawler

Cons:
I actually only have one...what they could have done with the Space Launch Command Shuttle #2, was to make the satellite different and not the same though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Just rating the rest of the set by the shuttle, this is one great classic Space set!  It comes with a satellite in the cargo bay, and a pilot.  Otherwise, a good set to fly around in space with.

Pros:

-Satellite

-Engines

-Fuel tank

-Details

-Minifig

Cons:

-Only one minifig fits inside

"alva","2010-12-21T01:12:51.04Z","Nice Launching Pad","Got this set from a collector that decided that he didnt want to collect Lego anymore, and I got this set with a really great price. Lucky!<br><br>When I contructed it, I thought that this set just a reguler set with no fun. Not many parts and not many building needed.<br>But after the set complete, I looked at it with complete awe. This set really represents a real shuttle launch pad. They have a detailed design for the rocket and the launch area.<br>I really like the clamping mechanism, they really can pull the rocket from horizontal position into vertical position. <br><br>Since this set, I started to hut for others set that contains shuttle and also started to obsessed with space theme, especially the classic space.<br><br>Really love with what Lego has done with this set, and I really recommended you guys out there to grab one if you able to find it. It is nice to display and also nice to play with.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Korik4","2009-11-04T14:26:30.903Z","One of the best sets Lego have created","  There are so many good things to write about this set, it's difficult to know where to start. Well, first off, the set looks fantastic. A fabulous centerpiece of any Lego collection, it also looks realistic as well. I recieved this bad boy for Christmas one year and preceeded to build it straight away, the whole set took around one and a half to two and a half hours to build. 

  The crane works well too, it's always nice to see a mechanical/electrical element to work well with all those bricks. The seperate parts of the shuttle work well too, the rockets and the fuel tank can all be dismantled in stages like the real thing, and so does the moving launch pad. Also the shuttle includes a cool arm inside the storage area. 

  The minifigs are great, I love the scientist and the astronaut in particular. 

  I spent a lot of time with this set as a kid; the amount of hours someone can get out of this set is incredible. Me and my friend both had this set and we both loved them. (I remember my friend dropping his assembled set down the stairs) 

  I cannot recommend any other Lego set over this one, it really is that good. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"codytoll","2009-12-08T15:07:30.577Z","A Favorite Forever","When I was in 2nd grade, I must admit I was obsessed with this set. I saved up money from my paper route for months, and as much as I built it up and anticipated it in my mind, it was still even cooler than I imagined. I've torn it down and rebuilt it probably a dozen times since then, and played with it for hours.

Pros:
It was one of the tallest sets at the time, but maintained a very solid structural integrity
The hoist is awesome and very functional; hoisting the boosters, fuel, and shuttle and attaching them to each other was a blast
Very attractively constructed
Cool minifigures, and in appropriate quantity
Compatible with other launch command sets (my brother had Launch Evac 1 and we spent hours averting disasters at the launch site)
Cool satellite that collapsed and fit into the back of the shuttle
Good tool set/walkie-talkies/fire extinguisher
Many rare pieces
IT HAS A SPACE SHUTTLE!

Con:
The only thing I wasn't fond of (and am not in any set) was the fact that in a few places, stickers overlapped adjacent pieces, (such as on the sign and the cargo bay of the shuttle), so if you wanted to build something else from them, you had to find somewhere to put the stickers that wouldn't ruin their stickiness. But I think the set was nearly as attractive without the stickers at all.

I highly recommend this purchase!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's near perfection.<br><br>Although not that many bricks used in the set (564) it still is very big and impressive. It uses 1,5 baseplates, and is almost 4 stories high.

"legomaniac_jacob","2011-12-25T17:00:17.35Z","Best shuttle set Lego ever made","This was another birthday present I received way back in the day.&nbsp; Definitely the best shuttle set Lego ever made, and one of my all time favorite sets.&nbsp; To me, it always seemed like the older Legoland shuttle sets were too blocky, and the newer ones after this were too sleek with too many specialty pieces.&nbsp; Shuttle Launch Pad struck the right balance of regular and specialty bricks.&nbsp; The red tower is epic and the shuttle ranked very high on my scale of playability.&nbsp; I frequently reenacted play launches in my head and stood up for take off, then held the shuttle in the air as if it were in orbit and opened the doors.&nbsp; It even has the movable arm inside it.&nbsp; I always identified with the astronaut minifig, his big gold visor was pretty neat.&nbsp; I also set this up with Century Skyway, another favorite set of mine, and I always felt the two went well together.<br><br>Only downside to this set was that the red tower sometimes broke off the baseplate, they could have reinforced it better at the base.&nbsp; Also, the decals on the side of the shuttle because a nuissance when disassembling and reassembling.&nbsp; After a while they lost their stickiness and got dirty as a result.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Tyutyu","2013-11-27T03:07:01.017Z","Best Lego set for a 9 year old back in 1995-1996. Still is a great set.","How it all began:<br>I had to visit a psychiatrist regularly after watching a Space Shuttle 
horror movie when I was 5 years old, because I had panic attacks where I
 imagined that Im in space with no air, suffocating. This kind old psychiatrist lady told my parents, that the only way I will heal, is if they teach me more about Space, Spacecraft (Mainly the Shuttle) and if they don't let me watch sick movies alone hehe. <br><br>Got this set as a combined Birthday-Name day-Christmas present (Yes I have it all at the same time. Sucks to be me hehe) at the age of 9. There was only 1 store in whole of New Delhi, India where this was sold (Only 2 boxes left), so I had to beg a lot until my parents gave up and bought this for me, hoping it would stop my suffocating ""space"" panic attacks.<br><br>I only wanted the Shuttle with the big grey fuel tank, didnt care about the rest of the set, but when I finished building the whole set, I fell in love with everything. Every day I had a minimum of two ""launches"" after lunch, while my parents were sleeping. I was (still is) one of my all time favorite presents.<br><br>I dont remember having a suffocating (or any other type of) panic attack ever since. This set healed me.<br><br><br>

<ul><li>That I didnt have another of this set in Blacktron black and yellow color scheme.<br></li></ul>
<p>This set is very educational for a kid. After getting this, I watched all the Shuttle related films and tv shows I could get my hands on.

"koen_theys","2016-10-31T09:28:57.973Z","Houstan, we have a whitening problem.","<h2><u><strong>Introduction:</strong></u></h2>

<p>Houstan, we have a problem. As a kid, who didn&rsquo;t liked these words. But in fact Houstan, I have a problem.<br />
As a child, I never got this impressive set. I cannot remember why, but it&#39;s definitely not about the unwillingness of my parents. Fast forward 25 years and I recently got the opportunity to buy it second hand. I didn&#39;t had to think twice about that.<br />
All the bricks were there, however, almost all the white bricks had the whitening problem. Over time, and that means years, decades, when exposed to sunlight white* LEGO bricks get slowly a yellowing look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>* this may also occur to grey bricks, however, the decolorizing is not that hard as for white bricks</p>

<h2><u><strong>Solution for yellowed white bricks</strong></u></h2>

<p>An internet search later I found out that there is a solution to turn those impacted bricks back to near its original white color. You have to treat your bricks with Hydrogen Peroxide. Hydrogen Peroxide is a transparent liquidate (water mixed with a chemical). There are several types of Hydrogen Peroxide, for example<br />
Hydrogen Peroxide 3%<br />
Hydrogen Peroxide 6%<br />
Hydrogen Peroxide 9%</p>

<p>I used the 3% solution. The 3% indicates how much of the Hydrogen Peroxide is mixed with water. For example. The 3% solution means, 3% Hydrogen Peroxide, 97% water.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>Container:</u></h3>

<p>So what do you have to do? You put all of your bricks in a transparent (important, read further) container and fill it with Hydrogen Peroxide. Make sure all your bricks are fully in the Hydrogen Peroxide. If a small peace is sticking out of the Hydrogen Peroxide, the surface that isn&rsquo;t soaked in the solution will not decolor.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>Sunlight:</u></h3>

<p>So why a transparent container. This solution works best if you put it in daylight, preferable sunlight. The sunlight acts as a huge accelerator. Some people even say it does not work without sunlight, however I&rsquo;m not sure about that yet. I noticed it also discolored overnight, but perhaps that was because the solution spent the daytime in sunlight and the chemical process wasn&#39;t yet worn out and had an after effect during nighttime?&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>Timing:</u></h3>

<p>How long does this take? It depends on how bad are the bricks yellowed and how many sunlight there is. Some bricks were white again after 12 hours, others spent 5 full days in the solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about bricks with stickers?:<br />
I used over six stickers and none came off nor where damaged.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>!IMPORTANT!</u></h3>

<p>Once you are satisfied with the deyellowing, make sure you wash the bricks with water and let them air dry. For the first batch I didn&rsquo;t do this and when I assembled the space shuttle again, my fingertips turned white. It was clearly paint as it didn&rsquo;t came off after washing my hands with soap. The next morning my fingertips where back normal. I do not yet understand why. When I assembled bricks that were washed after the treatment, I didn&rsquo;t had this problem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can reuse the solution over and over again, until the bricks aren&#39;t discolored any longer, and after 2 month is is also useless. The price in Europe is much more expensive as in the US. I paid 15 euros for 1 liter.</p>

<h2><br />
<u><strong>Set review</strong></u></h2>

<p>The set is part of a theme called &#39;Launch Command&#39;, containing of 5 sets:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6339-1/Shuttle-Launch-Pad"">6339 Shuttle Launch Pad</a></li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1995s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6339-1/Shuttle-Launch-Pad"">6339 Shuttle Launch Pad</a></p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""177"" src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/6339-1.jpg?199908060903"" width=""250"" /></p>

<p>So I bought it second hand, so I had to built the set a first time to see if all the pieces were there (yes they were). Disassembled, washed the bricks, did the yellow treatment of the white bricks and built it back up. Man, it is a really nice set to build. That launch tower is huge and good looking!</p>

<h3><u>Box / instructions</u></h3>

<p>The set comes in a big box, and as for the older LEGO sets, the prints on the boxes are always very nice. The launch pad and space shuttle is displayed. In the background, there is an evening setting, with a satellite dish and a moon. It is just so nice. Box 10 out of 10!</p>

<p>The instructions manual is one booklet, size A4. This a nice old style LEGO booklet.</p>

<h3><u>Playability</u></h3>

<p>10 out of 10. YOU HAVE A SPACE SHUTTLE! Apart from that this set has several nice features for playability. For starters, you have to raise up the rocket and then the shuttle. Then connect the shuttle to the rocket. The next step is to roll in the movable launch vehicle and lower down the space shuttle and rocket. Roll the launch vehicle back on the base plate to it&#39;s launch position. Lock the movable launch vehicle and start the count down. 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... bbbbgggghhhh ... we have lift off ...</p>

<p>There are also a bunch of minifig tools available to work an the space shuttle or whatever you make up. This set contains 4 minifigs. One astronaut, 2 workmen and 1 launch director.</p>

<p><u>Playability for the kids?</u> 10 out of 10. My 4 year old daughter her eyes popped out when I showed her the complete model. She did 20 launches non-stop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>Aging</u></h3>

<p>The set as a whole did age very well. Everything is still competitive comparing it with today&#39;s (2016s) LEGO, unlike roadcars/trucks from Town sets (4 studds with) comparing to modern days City sets (6 studds with).</p>

<p>So aging ... 9 out of 10.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have to replace some bricks with newer bricks, because some bricks are very loose and don&#39;t stick to each other that good anymore. (for example, the white rockets fall very quickly apart).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>Shuttle numbers</u></h3>

<p>The space shuttle is numbered number 2. In set 1995s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6544-1/Shuttle-Transcon-2"">6544 Shuttle Transcon 2</a> there is another shuttle, which is numbered 3.&nbsp;<br />
<img alt="""" height=""309"" src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/6544-1.jpg"" width=""248"" /></p>

<p>So where is number 1? Perhaps it is the Shuttle in set 1992s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6346-1/Shuttle-Launching-Crew"">6346 Shuttle lancing Crew</a>. This shuttle differs from the two shuttles above, and it isn&rsquo;t numbered. But since it bears the same logo as the 1995 Town Space Sets, it seems reasonable to think this is number 1.&nbsp;<br />
Image location:</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u>Sidenote</u></h3>

<p>It&#39;s not LEGO first attempt for a space shuttle or better yet, a launch site. In 1990 LEGO released an earlier set called <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/1682-1/Space-Shuttle-Launch"">1682 Space Shuttle Launch</a>. Compared with this 1995s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6339-1/Shuttle-Launch-Pad"">6339 Shuttle Launch Pad</a> you can clearly see that the apple didn&#39;t fell far from the tree and that the apple has blossomed tenfold.</p>
