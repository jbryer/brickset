"Spazman","2022-01-30T18:40:23.71Z","Excellent Set with Great Builds","<p>The build was very engaging. The snow and E-WEB were relatively simple, but the speeder bike is the star of the set. It manages to capture exquisite detail and shape while also feeling appropriately sized. Each part fits perfectly, and the build is very swooshable. The new shooter, which is new this year, works very well and from the shooter&#39;s height off the ground when it is in the E-WEB it will shoot the plate about a meter in the air and the plate has enough momentum to bounce and roll another two meters. It is very easy to use and looks better than some of the other shooters.</p>

<p>The minfigures are also impressive. It is also the most diverse stormtrooper (and related) battlepack that I have encountered. It contains two females and two males and three different skin tones. The weapons are sufficient and offer some variety and the printing is very nice on all of them. The helmets are perfect, especially the scout trooper&#39;s helmet.</p>

<p>Even though the set does not pack very many pieces, the builds are excellent enough to make up for it, the only problem is the price, which feels too expensive. Overall it is one of the best battlepacks and has a phenomenal speeder bike.</p>

<p>3 Snowtroopers and 1 Scout Trooper are included. The Snowtroopers&nbsp;have print on the back, very well detailed, representing the various buttons and lights of the armor. A curious detail is that the chest buttons of one of the troopers is slightly different from the other two. I thought it was a printing error, but it happened in the 2 sets I bought, so the question is whether it was intentional or not. The absence of a buildable backpack and the kama printed on the sides of the legs is a clear sign that these soldiers serve to fill the seats of the UCS AT-AT. The lack of fabric may bother some but the printed gray contrasts well with the white uniform. The choice of beige color for the hands is right. Due to the helmet mold, it is not possible to rotate the head. The lone Scout Trooper is an alternate version of Endor&#39;s Scout Trooper, swapping the black for gray, which makes more sense for camouflage. Equally detailed on the legs and back, the highlight is the double molded helmet that is simply the perfect representation in Lego form. All soldiers come with weapons (2 blasters, 1 long blaster with extended barrel and a pistol for the Scout Trooper). Diversity is present on the set: there are 3 different skin tones and half of the troopers are women.</p>

<h3>The builds</h3>

<p>The E-Web Turret has only 14 pieces. Very similar to the 75288 and 75313 sets but with the new stud shooter on top. It&#39;s very stable with 3 points of support but it&#39;s a little weird to look at with the double-barreled pistols forming the base of the tripod. The new stud shooter works well, but the turret should be handled with both hands, as The Mandalorian series and Battlefront games have shown.</p>

<p>The speeder bike is easily the best build on the set: stable, proportional and true to the design, although it didn&#39;t officially appear in Episode V. The publicity photos don&#39;t show it, but the Scout Trooper holds perfectly on the handlebars, although it has to be bent over, a bit standing, half sitting.</p>

<p>The snow trench looked good in the publicity photos but it only works from a specific angle; it is literally a trench with the front and the right side only. There is only one 2x3 studs for a single trooper to stay. Binoculars are basically useless. I bought 2 sets and ended up joining the two trenches in a single build, but the use of the LEFT PLATE 3X8 W/ANGLE prevents a mirrored model of the original trench from being built, which is a shame.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>

<p>The model gives the feeling that it could be more, either because of the turret design or the incomplete trench. But to fulfill the purpose of a battle pack, which is to form a battalion or an army, it is recommended by the figures. I&#39;d say wait for a discount.</p>

"Doogiemy2k","2022-04-01T15:06:22.917Z","Fun set. Great Army builder","<p>Excited to have another Battle Pack to beef up my building of a Hoth series and these guys fit well with the previous sets.</p>

<p>The blaster with fireable piece adds to the payability of the series and the little trench can be added to existing parts to form more accurate and detailed trench and terrain systems.</p>

<p>The different face and skin tones for the troopers is a neat turn and would be even better if hair parts came for when the helmets were off, because with the helmets on&nbsp;you don&#39;t see the faces anyway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now all I need are equivalent Rebel Battle packs to even out the forces.</p>

"wheetree","2022-05-17T03:06:53.347Z","For the mini-figs","<p>The battle sets are all about getting more mini-figs for your battle-scene play and this one does that.&nbsp; The defensive wall is a nice little piece, just the right size for the set.</p>

<p>The speeder bike is okay, but I still say they don&#39;t belong on Hoth.&nbsp; I mean the Alliance was still adapting their speeders to handle the cold; Imperials on bikes would be popsicles.&nbsp; Instead I wish they&#39;d included a power pack for the E-Web.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which leads me to the new stud-launcher. I like this new design. Very easy to load and it flings the stud with surprising force.&nbsp; Keep an eye on where they&#39;re going with this one.&nbsp; MUCH better than the disc shooter in the 2020 Snowspeeder (75268).</p>

<p>Overall, a nice addition to the Hoth collection.</p>

<p>Now if only I could get my AT-AT to stop falling down in the middle of the night...</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-05-24T17:32:42.013Z","Snowtrooper Battle Pack","<p>What&#39;s up everyone it&#39;s AlkkuV back with another review. Foremost I&#39;m sorry for being inactive, but I lost my interest. But I got it back now. I will right two reviews of the two of my newest Star Wars sets. But without further ado let&#39;s get into the review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: Nothing special. Good art on the box and normal instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This set comes with 105 pieces. Some of my favourite pieces are&nbsp;PLATE 1X2, W/ SHOOTER, NO. 1 and PLATE 1x2, rounded NO. 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MInifigures: This set comes with four minifigures and one of them is unique to this set. So the unique one is the Hoth Scout Trooper. The three other are just normal snowtroopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Speeder: The speeder is most used vehicle by the Scout Troopers. The speeder model has been used in many sets. This one is different because it is a Hoth version. Normally it would be brown right?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turret: The turret is pretty basic. Three legs and a handle, so the gunner can hold on to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trench: The set comes with a little piece of trench. It gives enough cover, so the trooper can shoot freely around.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall rating: Overall I think this set is a very good army builder. The parts are nothing special. The minifigures are good for army builder. The playability is decent, but you need rebels to fight against them. Overall I would give this set a 4,5/5.</p>

"ICAbricks","2022-10-31T15:11:38.15Z","Exceeded my expectations","<p>I got this set at a Dollar General&nbsp;(along with some candy corn). I thought it would go well with some of the other Imperial sets I own, so I decided to give it a chance.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>The set comes with three Snowtroopers and a Scout Trooper. The minifig selection isn&#39;t bad, although I kinda wish there was a Snowtrooper Commander.&nbsp;But still, I&#39;m glad that the Scout Trooper added some diversity to the minifigs. Speaking of which, there are several different genders and skin tones among the minifigures. There are two male and two female characters each, as well as 2 Light Nougat, 1&nbsp;Dark Brown, and 1 Medium Nougat skin tones. The helmets cover them up, so on the one hand, I think that the diversity is okay, on the other hand it seems a bit unnecessary. But still, good selection overall.</p>

<p><strong>Builds:</strong></p>

<p>There are three builds with the set. The first is an E-Web cannon. The model is somewhat fragile, but very well detailed. On top is one of the new stud shooters, which I&#39;ll address later. The newer, blockier shooter&nbsp;seems somewhat unsightly on top, but if you imagine it as a gunsight or ammo pack I guess it&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>There is also a small section of snowy terrain. On the box it looks rather small, but it&#39;s actually quite substantial. There is a small studded space for placing a minifigure, and a clip holds a pair of macrobinoculars. It adds some nice detail to the set, and it might even be worth the 5-dollar price jump.</p>

<p>And lastly there is the speeder bike, which is EXCELLENT. The model is so detailed, yet it still manages a minifigure-scale play value. The back part, however, is only connected by two studs, and it can fall off if you aren&#39;t careful.</p>

<p><strong>The New Stud Shooters:</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, I want to address the new stud shooters introduced this year. They actually aren&#39;t that bad. However, they are incredibly powerful - while shooting it once, I shot the stud into the next room! They&#39;d be good for themes such as Jurassic World or Avatar, but for Star Wars they&#39;re just too blocky. The old ones were definitely better, but the new ones aren&#39;t as bad as I thought. Although LEGO probably shouldn&#39;t have introduced them in the Star Wars wave - I&#39;ll never forget that trashy Razor Crest Microfighter.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2023-01-02T05:02:14.647Z","Pretty Chill Set","<p>While they increased the battle pack price to $20 from $15 which kind of stinks they help make it better by including more builds. The speeder bike build is very good and integrates well with the UCS AT-AT. The E web blaster cannon is great and includes some great parts including some blaster pieces in black that we do not get very often. The snow bank which i candider extra is a great addition and helps provide cover for your snow troopers as well as great pieces for using in a Hoth moc. The 3 snow troopers are great figures I just wish they had cloth skirts instead of printed skirts and the snow scout trooper is a great addition to your snow trooper army and provides a nice army building character that is still unique and exclusive to the set. If you have the UCS AT-AT I would suggest getting at least 4 of these sets, so you can put the speeders inside, but you would require 12 battle packs to fill all 40 seats with regular snow troopers but only 9 if you want to include your snow scout troopers.&nbsp;</p>

"Captainfives1514","2023-01-03T14:15:41.033Z","The Return of the Snowtrooper Battle Pack!","<p>&nbsp; Twelve years have passed since the last true Snowtrooper battle pack. So LEGO has decided to a redo on the popular Hoth lineup. So let&#39;s take a look at the smallest set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; We get three Snowtroopers! Finally, a battle pack of actual imperial troopers no officers in sight! The new dual moulded helmets are excellent. Their torsos are printed with cold weather survival gear. There legs have kamas printed on them. They each have unique faces under their helmets.</p>

<p>&nbsp; There is also included a cold weather Scout Trooper. With a great helmet and an excellent printing on the minifigure&#39;s torso and legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is very straightforward with several interesting pieces and techniques. First we have a E-web blaster cannon very similar to the one included in the 75288&nbsp;AT-AT.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We also get a newer version of the Imperial speeder bike. It is also very similar to the one included in 75288 and 75313 AT-AT.</p>

<p>&nbsp; We also get a trench of snow for troopers to take cover behind.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Pros;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; - No imperial officers</p>

<p>&nbsp;- No handheld stud shooters</p>

<p>&nbsp;- diversity of troopers gender and race.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cons;</p>

<p>&nbsp;- No cloth kamas</p>

<p>&nbsp;- ugly stud shooter component</p>

<p>&nbsp;- price increase&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall a great LEGO set one of the best battle packs I must say.</p>

"LewisWgamer","2023-01-07T09:25:28.23Z","Would recommend to buy. Little bit pricey though...","<p>I enjoyed building this set and adding it to my LEGO Star Wars Hoth Scene that I am currently building. It is on the pricey side after battlepacks went up in price in 2022. If you are looking for some Hoth battle troopers (Snow troopers) or are just looking for some Star Wars minifigs I can recommend. It does come with an imperial scout trooper which isn&#39;t an issue as LEGO always add a random figure into the mix.</p>
