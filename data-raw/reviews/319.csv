"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T21:51:02Z","This Is The Island","WHAT! Why does everyone think this is horrible? I LOVE IT!!! I found Island 1 a bit primitive (not being able to go on grass and all). Island 2 was much better. You could finally see Pepper move. But Island Extreme Stunts took the cake for me.

Pros:

When you double jump you finally go a fair way.

You are tuned into L.E.G.O radio most of the time (good 
for those who liked the juke box in Island 1).

You get a PDA!! (Personal Digital Assistant)

In the PDA you have a very good map.

You collect cards that tell you facts about the island residents.

You collect lots of red and yellow 2 X 4 bricks to make Lego animals.

You earn licenses to drive/fly vehicles.

You get to watch the movie you made after the boss (which can be annoying but is lots of fun).

You can walk very slowly to get more control when walking on a plank.

You get to see the movie come together as you play the games that include: car driving, motor bike driving, jet skiing, plane smashing and air boarding.

You constantly have Brickster Bots causing trouble around the place.

You have two skate parks that you can do tricks in (and earn points for (not like Island 2)).

The residents seem to have lives (eg: Snap Locket holds a Ti Chi class)

Cons

Pepper doesn’t really say anything.

There aren’t any fair sized islands to visit like Island 2.

Could have been a bit longer.

You can't see the movie without going through the boss (well you can explore the disc like I did :oP).

uhhmm that’s about it. See yuh.

This is definitely better than the previous LEGO Island games as it was larger, more detailed (though like most games had glitches) and ran quicker and easier. As a kid this was really fun, and had much more to it than the original (but isn't as classic) and had an almost adventurous feel to it. What was great is that the game included music, some decent humor (like how it never seemed to stop being sunny, even though the weatherman seemed to get bored of saying it), and the experience of a challenge with plenty of games, vehicles, sidequests (like collecting bricks and cards) and much more.

The worst cons to it are that 1: once the final boss is beaten (even though it is annoying) you can't do it over again, leaving a slight hint of boredom...
and 2: (please for the sake of sanity don't try this) when flying the helicopter in the underground cave, since it can't go too close to the water, in certain areas, it gets stuck and will not move, making a repetitive and rapid clunking sound the game makes when you collide with walls. If you do this you will be unable to leave (but if you're persistant and keep trying, eventually, it may come out...) and if you haven't saved recently, all is lost (nooooooooooo!). Even worse is if you're don't realize the situation and save while this is occuring, the whole file is now useless unless you get out. In the end, if you safely travel through there by helicopter, you get a great view of some sort of crystal seam in the cavern walls that is painfully hard to realize by boat.

Lego Island Xtreme Stunts (lets just refer to it as ""LIXS"") is a video game where you play as a generic twat called ""Pepper"". You're job is to go through lots of tasks to accomplish you're ultimate goal: Making a movie. Yeah, the plot isn't going to win any BAFTA's, but what it is is very good. You get to roam around Lego Island (whatever it's called) and do plenty of tasks to - oh wait nevermind.
