"peti7788","2022-01-30T17:50:40.657Z","Much better than the previous version","<p>4 years ago, I bought the predecessor of this set, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60177-1/Airshow-Jet"" target=""_blank"">60177 Airshow Jet</a> set.&nbsp;Because I love airplanes and this set was even cheaper than its predecessor, I bought it right away. At the time,<strong> I had no idea it was much better than the previous version.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start the story a little older and go back to 1999.&nbsp;I think the back wings of this plane are from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/2774-1/Red-Tiger"" target=""_blank"">Red Tiger plane</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And here the rear wings were finally printed instead of the stickers.&nbsp;The engine is also much more ingenious if you spin the wheel, the flame piece is really like if the afterburner were working.&nbsp;The nose and wings of the plane are also cleaner.&nbsp;The wings here are at least larger and consist of only 1 part.&nbsp;<strong>So the designer did a very good job! It&rsquo;s hard to make a good toy&nbsp;out of so few parts, especially at the entry level.</strong></p>

<p>But you know, I also use to describe what I don&#39;t like.&nbsp;For example, there is no engine&nbsp;intake.&nbsp;Where does the air go in?&nbsp;The second is the landing gear. The rear wheels are lower, looking pretty sad.&nbsp;The 2 x 8 bottom connecting plate would have been better in black instead of gray. I didn&rsquo;t even put it on, I used the wheel fork instead as a connection.&nbsp;The cockpit is very empty, no seats and no HUD as in the previous set.&nbsp;Rather, they put a 2x2 blue tile in it that isn&rsquo;t visible and you&rsquo;ll never take it out again. And this set also has the usual construction nonsense of Lego, that what could be built from traditional parts is made into a new special part, see below.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are two parts I haven&#39;t met yet.&nbsp;One is a mixture of a gray <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6326478/brick-2x2-w-4-85-hole-no-1"" target=""_blank"">plate and a brick with a technic hole in it</a>.&nbsp;The other is a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6285598/wheel-dia-14-4-w-1-9-axle"" target=""_blank"">dual molded front wheel</a>. I think it&#39;s cheaper to make than the old tire, but unfortunately I can&#39;t put off-road tire&nbsp;on it that way. I&#39;m not happy about it.&nbsp;This new material from which the windshield is made is of very poor quality, easily scratched, and has even been scratched together in the package.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>For me, the innovation was just the new helmet.&nbsp;Since this is a starter set, unfortunately there is no oxygen mask for the helmet. But it doesn&#39;t bother me.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>The whole set consists of far fewer parts than its <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60177-1/Airshow-Jet"" target=""_blank"">predecessor</a>, yet is much more imaginative, beautiful and usable<strong>. I absolutely recommend it</strong>, so you have to buy it for the price!</p>

<h3>My Mod</h3>

<p>I just wanted to change what makes the plane simpler and cheaper, yet more beautiful.&nbsp;This only applies to the cockpit and landing gear.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51852163231_bd79dc667c_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" /></p>

<p>I disappeared for the ugly 2x8 gray plate, put a 2x2 brick in its place, and replaced the rear wheels with smaller ones to match the size of the front wheel. So it&#39;s completely level.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51852486304_458f4f291d_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" />I put a seat in the cockpit.&nbsp;For this, I changed the 2x3 slope brick to 2x2. There are also 2 options for the HUD.&nbsp;It is easier if there are 2 pieces of green 2x3 bricks. And not green, it&#39;s gray. And we will put one in advance. We put the printed cheese slope on it.</p>

<p>This leaves room for two 1x2 jumped pieces. One for the joystick, the other for the HUD.</p>

<p>The other solution is nicer, I like it better. Instead of a 2x3 brick, I used a 1x2 jumper plate. More realistic.</p>

<p>Dear Lego, you don&#39;t have to develop new parts for every set, you can also fix the afterburner with traditional technic bricks.</p>

<p>I know this sounds like a pinch, but it&rsquo;s because of such little things that a lego set will be expensive.&nbsp;<strong>Fortunately, it was cheap, exceptionally.</strong> I hope there will be more ingenious entry-level sets.</p>
