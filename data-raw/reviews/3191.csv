"meyerc13","2011-01-05T18:52:02.95Z","One of the best Town Fire Trucks!","<p>It's hard to believe this set is 17 years old.&nbsp; While a four stud wide 'tiller' style fire semi truck is clearly undersized in today's LEGO City, this set has tons of play value so it might be worth an exception should you have the chance to pick this set up.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>If you compare this set to the other Town fire trucks, you'll find that this is one of the nicer looking trucks.&nbsp; Unlike some of the early sets, this set actually has a roof for the driver (and it opens!).&nbsp; The outriggers not only look nice, but they add a lot of play value as well.&nbsp; <br></li><li>In addition to the outriggers, this truck comes with an extremely long ladder, using four ladder sections.&nbsp; You'll need a long hose to reach the top of that ladder, and this set has you covered there as well.&nbsp; You might think such a long ladder would be difficult to play with, but the outriggers and a clever brace for the ladder help to hold it up and keep the truck from tipping while fighting fires in the tallest skyscrapers.<br></li><li>The set includes two minifigs, one with a black fire coat, the other wearing a gray firesuit.&nbsp; It is nice to have variety so that all of your firemen aren't identical.</li><li>The minifigs also have nice accessories like an oxygen tank/mask/face shield; and an axe.&nbsp; There are also removable barricades that can be placed around the scene of your fire.</li><li>Another great thing about this truck is that it holds both of the 
included minifigures.&nbsp; There are even LEGO City fire trucks that can't 
say that!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It's hard to find problems with this set.&nbsp; If you compare it with modern LEGO City fire trucks, clearly it is undersized, but that's because it is over fifteen years old so I can't really hold that against the set.<br></li><li>If I had to find a fault with the set, I'd probably say it is that the cab of the truck doesn't have doors.&nbsp; Unfortunately that trend resurfaced in LEGO City, but I remember my 1980's trucks having doors so I don't think it is unreasonable to expect this truck to have them as well.</li><li>Another minor complaint, and it may be due to nearly 20 year old parts losing their clutching power, but the outriggers seem to lose parts occasionally.<br></li></ul>Overall this is a great set, and if you run across a used version I'd definitely recommend picking it up, if for nothing other than the parts and minifigs.&nbsp; While it will look somewhat out of place in a modern LEGO City, if you have other LEGO Town elements mixed in it will fit in right alongside them.&nbsp; You'll find few LEGO Town fire trucks that have withstood the test of time as well as this one, so I highly recommend keeping an eye out for it!",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-27T05:14:48.987Z","LEGO Town (Fire) - Hook & Ladder Review","This set is a very cool set to have and it's also a nice addition to any LEGO city. The build of this vehicle is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. The trailer can be removed from the truck and the ceiling of the truck can be opened very easily. The trailer has some useful accessories, like 2 barriers, a stand which you can sviwel and a&nbsp; ladder which sviwels full 360Â°. It's a fun set to play with and it's very easy to maneuver as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a very cool set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
