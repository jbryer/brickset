As I&#39;m currently working on MOCs of classic City sets from my youth bringing them in line with my current city scale,&nbsp;having conceded to making all vehicles&nbsp;6 wide, the 2 extra studs in width work well as cranes of this sort do have that bit of extra width, but it doesn&#39;t go as far as #7249 being 12 studs wide so stays somewhat in scale.</p>

<p>The colour scheme is great&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Flame Yellowish Orange goes nicely with the bright blue.The build is fairly stock standard for a City set with over simplified instructions but the set does have some nice features with a clever way of holding the outriggers in place while not extended and a nice mechanism for raising and lowering the main arm of the crane. There is also a new grey string that I&#39;m not completely sold on yet and it does differ from what is on the official images.</p>

<p>As with most City sets there are a few places where a bit more work could have been done like the large see through gaps from the wheel arches but nothing a little modifying can&#39;t fix (it is LEGO after all).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are great with both people wearing full PPE and with some tools at hand. As I won&#39;t be converting to the new road system I&#39;m going to need to find a use for these road plates I&#39;m accumulating but for those that are using it the&nbsp;extra piece will come in handy.&nbsp;LEGO should have included a few of the printed line marking tiles for the road though.</p>

<p>At a rather steep A$59.99 I would have usually waited for a sale in a regular retailer as I will be for the other City sets but I just could not resist this one so picked it up.</p>

<p>Good play value as all cranes are and I&#39;m glad I grabbed it.</p>

"gorf43","2022-01-17T02:39:21.973Z","A surprisingly solid City set ","<p>I had seen the leaks of this set, thought it looked interesting, and figured I would buy it eventually. Thanks to Legos now usual screw up on Jan1, I found myself with some extra Lego money and decided to buy this. Im glad I did!&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, Im an adult, not a kid, and I will treat this set as such. I also haven&#39;t bought a City set for years, besides the most recent Tractor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing I like about this set is the color. It seems quite European, but it would easily work for a North American one too. I think it would have been a bit more realistic if it was white, but at least its a fresh new colour combo! The actual crane itself isn&#39;t too complicated, but it was interesting enough to keep me mildly entertained. Its got two gears on one side, one operates the cable, the other operates the boom. It would have been nice to have a crank that rotates the entire structure, but that might have taken up too much space. The outriggers I believe are a new design for a City set, (that Ive seen at least) because they aren&#39;t the usual folding ones Im familiar with. They offer a&nbsp;more interesting design and are quite accurate to a real crane. I like how they attach inside the crane, but not once they are extended, as its very easy for them to slide around.&nbsp;There are some ugly colours visible through the wheels, and a 4x4 round brick is visible under the crane. Which is red. Could have been grey or black, but no, its bright red. The minifigs aren&#39;t very special as I don&#39;t usually collect stuff like this, but they do go well with the set and would be even better if one was to put this in their city. There aren&#39;t too many stickers, and what it does have&nbsp;only adds to the look of the crane. The road plate was a bit annoying, as I don&#39;t collect City and Im basically paying for a big useless plate that will sit in a bin forever. There is, however, one rather glaring problem: the string. There is nothing&nbsp;whatsoever that directs it. It feeds through at the very top, but from there down is nothing to keep it in the middle of the boom. It has a huge reel at the bottom that allows it to move extremely far in each direction away from the boom. So, if the string is reeled too much on one side of the reel,&nbsp;it leaves there from an angle going directly up to the very tip, looking extremely unrealistic and causing extreme annoyance! Its easy to fix: I put a 1x1 clip about one quarter of the way up the main boom, and put a small&nbsp;gear on the Technic axle so the string has less room to reel up. I thought that it was a very stupid problem, and that even young kids would find it irritating. Luckily, its quite fixable!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: nice color. relative accuracy to real life. interesting functions. good scale for a Lego city. good price. can be put into a display with few mods. is surprisingly fun! easy to mod for extra realism.</p>

<p>Cons: useless road plate. some incorrect colours visible. string reels poorly. extended outriggers can slide around.</p>

<p>Overall, a brilliant set, and definitely worth picking up. It will be great in a city display with minimal mods and&nbsp;even non City fans will find it a cool model and a fresh change of pace. Pros easily outweigh the cons here!&nbsp;</p>

"Skut","2022-03-15T09:03:19.92Z","Best Town/City Crane EVER (plus a bonus fix for the loose stabilisers)","<p>Well it has taken a set of this quality to get me off the reviewing &#39;fence&#39; after six years!&nbsp; But I simply could not pass up the opportunity to express my appreciation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mobile cranes have a long history through the Town and, later, City ranges, starting with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6361-1/Mobile-Crane"">https://brickset.com/sets/6361-1/Mobile-Crane</a>&nbsp; and ranging up to the colossal&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7249-1/XXL-Mobile-Crane"">https://brickset.com/sets/7249-1/XXL-Mobile-Crane</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; There have also been a few cranes of varying quality included in combo sets like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60026-1/Town-Square"">https://brickset.com/sets/60026-1/Town-Square</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the best so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is an almost perfect combination of looks and function.&nbsp; The 8-wide scale with a low profile is perfectly scaled for City and very reminiscent of a real mobile crane.&nbsp; The colour scheme is great - the blue and yellow really pops.&nbsp; Other reviewers have correctly pointed out some weird colours in the chassis but these are hard to see.&nbsp; The jib extension, rotation and elevation are all very intuitive and add greatly to the play value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Others have commented that the payload - a road plate - is a bit boring but it&#39;s actually a pretty authentic choice and is also a clever marketing ploy to get young (and not-so-young) builders thinking about assembling a larger road layout for their city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set does have a few annoying flaws.&nbsp; The cab is directly exposed to the front wheels, so you will need two seats:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/407921"">https://brickset.com/parts/407921</a>&nbsp;, two of these SNOT plates:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6163471/angular-plate-1-5-top-1x2-1-2"">https://brickset.com/parts/6163471/angular-plate-1-5-top-1x2-1-2</a>&nbsp;and some assorted blue plates and tiles to close the gaps.&nbsp; Even with seats added, the minifigs still fit in the cab with no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Likewise, as has been pointed out by others, there is no guide for the cable as it leaves the winch, but a basic fix using a clip&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6348056/plate-1x1-w-up-right-holder"">https://brickset.com/parts/6348056/plate-1x1-w-up-right-holder</a>&nbsp;attached on top of&nbsp;another plate or brick is an easy fix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most annoying flaw is that the stabilisers don&#39;t lock into position when deployed.&nbsp; I can&#39;t work out why Lego didn&#39;t fix this - maybe what I&#39;m about to describe is somehow an illegal build under their strict rules, but I can&#39;t see why.&nbsp; Anyway, here&#39;s what you can do to fix this issue:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Complete instructions to step 22.</li>
	<li>Remove the two blue corner plates you just put on.</li>
	<li>Remove the two white domed tiles.</li>
	<li>Attach two of these round plates with shaft (colour unimportant)&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-31561"">https://brickset.com/parts/design-31561</a>&nbsp;where the two white tiles were.</li>
	<li>Attach two&nbsp;1x2 plates&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/302323/plate-1x2"">https://brickset.com/parts/302323/plate-1x2</a>&nbsp;on top of the now-exposed 1x2 trans-yellow plates.</li>
	<li>Rest two clips&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6352221/plate-1x1-w-holder"">https://brickset.com/parts/6352221/plate-1x1-w-holder</a>&nbsp;on the now-exposed 1x1 round tiles, with each clip pointing inwards towards the plates with shaft you just put on.</li>
	<li>Of course everything in this section is duplicated, so you&#39;ll need twice the number of parts listed above.&nbsp; All in all, still a cheap visit to Bricklink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Continue with step 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now you will have a crane with working stabilisers, which lock into the deployed position with a very satisfying click!</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all still a great set despite the glitches and well worth the money.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>

"Corkscrew_Brik36","2023-04-10T19:30:15.603Z","A set ripped right from the Golden Age of Lego City.","<p>I bought this set on sale for $15, and it is a purchase I definitely don&#39;t regret. Something about the design and thought put into this set brought me back to the old and in my opinion much better sets from the City theme&nbsp;from the years 2012-2014. I personally grew up with sets mostly from 2014 and onwards, so I remember vividly gazing at the back of my instruction manuals at sets that looked similar to this.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>The build was overall fun and uses good pieces in creative ways, which I appreciate greatly. My only gripe with the set is the string used for the crane mechanism. Overall, it does its job decently, but because of its thicker-than-average size, it tends&nbsp;to untie itself often.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The design of this set is overall reminiscent of sets like 60061, with double windscreens in front, a bulky but straightforward shape, and big thick wheels. The crane on top of the truck has a well-executed design with good use of technic pieces that allow the mechanism to function. The color scheme of blue and flame-yellowish orange makes for a diverse feeling set that stands out from the&nbsp;usual construction sets with a plain yellow color scheme.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Two minifigures are included with this set, and both are about what you would expect in an average City set. I must say, though, the white hard hat pieces are a nice change from the red ones we&#39;ve become accustomed to in City sets for a long time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play Features</h2>

<p>There is only one real play feature in this set, and that is the crane mechanism itself. The crane is controlled using two Technic gear pieces, one that extends the string, and one below it that raises and lowers the crane arm. This is&nbsp;very well executed&nbsp;in my opinion, as it provides enough function to keep kids entertained for a while.</p>

<p>Other basic features include three&nbsp;seats total for minifigures, two in the truck, and one in the crane operator&#39;s seat. There are also four small arms that extend from the base of the truck to provide stability to the truck while the crane is in operation.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Excellent design</li>
	<li>Good functionality</li>
	<li>String reaches considerably long length</li>
	<li>Fun for kids and good for builders</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>String is&nbsp;tedious to work with</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, this set is an excellent addition to anyone&#39;s collection, and also a fun time for kids as well. I would love to see more of this type of sets from Lego in the future.&nbsp;</p>
