<br />
The little grounds mobile is an okay little build but it feels quite fragile. Otherwise, the set is fine and has a nice selection of parts and things you can do with it using your imagination.</p>

<p>The minifigures are nothing terribly groundbreaking, but I do like the park employee&#39;s uniform and the hairpiece for the kid minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Park&quot; Model</p>

<p>The set comes with a picnic table and a tree which are both attached to a small base with some greenery on it. The picnic table is nice, but could be extended a bit to allow for more minifigures to sit. The tree is well done and has some cool details. The tree does look a little too square from the back but from the front/sides it looks pretty good.<br />
<br />
Parts:<br />
You get some pretty good parts in this set, the most important being the two squirrels. The two squirrels are amazingly cute. You also get some other cool parts like acorns. Finally, there are enough items, such as cups and tools, for the minifigures to interact with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Build:<br />
The build was pretty average but contains only one sticker, justifying the 5+ age rating.<br />
<br />
Vehicles:<br />
The park employee has a little three-wheeled vehicle that is absolutely great. It looks amazing for such a small vehicle is my favourite part of the set (other than the squirrels).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other two minifigures have&nbsp;a bike with an attached cart that, while simple, increases the play value.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
I think this set is very good. You get a lot for 20 dollars and the play value of the set is high. Furthermore, this set can be very easily added to an existing Lego City one has made with relative ease.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Rating:<br />
5/5</p>
