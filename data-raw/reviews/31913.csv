<p>I had hoped this set would be better, but it was disappointing in a few ways...</p>

<p>I really like the idea of this set. It has an SUV and horse trailer, obviously with a horse, but I found it to be a bit more &quot;kiddy&quot; than I was hoping. The SUV could be described as having unrealistic colours, and I think thats true. (I like the colour though) The proportions could be better, but Ill give them a pass, especially for a City set. I don&#39;t like that the interior is so... bad. When is Lego going to catch on that most vehicles don&#39;t have bright red interiors. And the steering wheel is right down in the middle, out of view. It wouldn&#39;t have been hard to build up the bottom and place the wheel off to one side like a real car and have it slightly poke above the &quot;dashboard&quot; as well. I like the white plate visible at the back to represent the licence plate, but at the front, its a regular 1x2 sticker. One or the other Lego, you cant have two different sizes of licence plates. Also, the interior could have benefited from some half stud half tile 2x2 plates so the minifigs were easier to place and remove. The front of the SUV has big ugly gaps in between the grille and front fenders, easily solved with two 1x1 plates, but apparently Lego didn&#39;t think that&nbsp;was worth doing.&nbsp;The horse trailer is whats great about this set though. It fits the horse and the box of gear, and the colour and shape are spot&nbsp;on! There are some minor problems: It would be nice if there was room for the horse to stick its head out the back and the bottom of the trailer is unnecessarily built up. The extra plates can easily be removed from the bottom, and the wheels are still secure, and the door could be custom built to make it slightly smaller. There is also a nice horse jump with I suppose adjustable heights and very nice colours as well. The set also includes a saddle, dog, two appropriate minifigs, and a box with carrot, helmet, and brush. The horse is a new colour and bricks are included for without its saddle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: great concept. new horse color. great looking trailer. nice jump to add some detail.</p>

<p>Cons: SUV reminds you why you aren&#39;t into City anymore. And thats half the set...</p>

<p>Overall, I like the concept more than the set itself. As an adult, the SUV felt very much a City set and left me wanting a lot more. The trailer and new horse colour I think just save the set, but the price might feel a little steep when you build the SUV. It in no way compares to that safari one that came out a while back. If you have the pieces and enjoy customising sets, its really not hard to fix, and once it is, it will go well in a city display. No cool functions or interesting building techniques here. Definitely a set for kids Im afraid.&nbsp;</p>
