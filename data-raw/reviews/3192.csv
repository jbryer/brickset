<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some nice and useful parts in it which are always great for any future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very cool. We get the tanker driver and he had a red cap, green pants, a basic smiley face and a white shirt with the octan logo. The pilot has a plain black shirt, a black helmet, black shades on his face and white pants.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get two stickers to put on.<br></p>

"James83","2013-01-04T10:30:06.113Z","A Nice Little Flyaway Set","<p>This set was known in the UK as the Survey Flyer, which explains the video camera on the side. It's a nice little aircraft that isn't quite the usual from Lego.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicles</strong></p><p>The aicraft is a fairly large design but easy to assemble. The aircraft has a very smart white-black-red colour scheme. The cockpit has a fighter-style canopy with a spacious area to sit in and a printed flightdeck block rather than the sticks or wheels older plane sets had. In front of the computer is space to stow the suitcase. On the side of the fuselage is a video camera with tape brick. A neat touch, but the method of attachment is a bit flimsy. The undercarriage consists of a front wheel on a turntable to allow steering on the ground and the rear wheels have&nbsp;a wide track and have struts that support the wings. The wings have navigation lights on them and the wings support the two tail booms. These are thin but the swept tails also give a fighter-style appearance and these have small tailplanes on them. The rear engine is neatly fitted in, there are no vent bricks but the propeller is large, much more realistic than the older sets with those small blades. The four grey blades look the part. Overall this is one of the best designed aircraft.</p><p>An added bonus with this set is the neat little Octan&nbsp;refuelling truck. It has a steering wheel and a rear tank with a pipe and nozzle. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>The pilot has grey trousers, a black top, sunglasses head&nbsp;and a black helmet with visor. The Octan employee is standard.</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>This aircraft is big but its nicely detailed with real-world features&nbsp;and looks great. The little tanker is a great addition to any airport. The camera on the aircraft looks a bit odd but you could remove it and have a fast touring aircraft instead. You could even fit weapons to it and make a Lego Air Force if you wanted to. The realistic propeller makes this set stand out and its a pity more aircraft using them weren't designed as it makes a change from the usual airliners.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
