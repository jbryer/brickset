<p>were here!!</p>

<p>the ultimate set made for any nineties&nbsp;or early two thousand retro gamer fan, this set is built for you( and/or any other sonic fan)&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set has our favourite blue blur and our egg-shaped foe, the set has 1125 pieces and retails for 69.99 and has a total of 1 minifig and 3(ish) buildable figures the set has 7 bags and took me about 3hrs to build.</p>

<p>The figures are superb! The &uml;baddies&uml; in the set consist of crab meat, motto bug, and egg man, the motto bug and crab meat look amazing and very accurate to the game, you can really see how much love and care the designers put into their builds, the egg man figure, on the other hand, has a very good build for the body, the egg shape came out exquisitely but the head, on the other hand, used a dots1x1 piece as the nose it looks horrible, but the rest of the build/ head looks very good. the&nbsp;sonic figure has flesh-colored arms instead of the tan arms used in the dimensions this is a way better and more accurate to the video game, speaking of the video game this set is based o,</p>

<p>the original set was based on the sonic mania game that came out in 2017 while the set that lego produced is based on the original game that came out in 2019&nbsp; while others may think that this was a bad idea, I think it was one of the many things that lego did to grow audience appeal, by making it based off of the 1st sonic game and not a modern one, it becomes more recognizable to younger kids, but I still think that the Eggman mech would have made this set better :)</p>

<p>the build is semi repetitive, but there are enough breaks between them, so It doesn&#39;t get too overbearing, when I say the build is VERY easy to mess up I mean it, I don&#39;t know how many times i messed up the build, and had to go back&nbsp;and fix a mistake I had previously made, this happened so many times, especially above the loop (though I did build this set late at night so take my sayings with a grain of salt&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although we&#39;ve some ideas/regular sets based on video games ie: Mario, overwatch I think that this single set blows all the other ones out of the water, with its great build amazing minifigs, and superb display/ play value I think it is the best modern ideas set under $100</p>

"Tuzi","2022-11-10T18:26:03.84Z","Must have for all Sonic fans","<p>I purchased this set on discount for 60 bucks at the local Intertoys here in NL.</p>

<p>While I am personally not a big fan of the games, I&#39;ve always liked the looks of the classic Sonic games. When I saw this set come out in stores I was pretty excited, but never got around to buying it because I don&#39;t really care too much for display pieces. When the local toy store put it on discount however I bit the bullet anyway. After all, that Sonic minifig&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;nice!</p>

<p>The set consists out of ~4 modules, Robotnik in his flying ship, a crab, an angry (well, depending on the sticker you choose) beetle robot and of course the blue hedgehog himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main level part is 4 studs in width and 44 studs in length. It features some grass, a really nicely built bridge, a loop and a platform.</p>

<p>Building the set is an absolute chore - Having to stack 1x1 plates together over and over again becomes quite boring, and it&#39;s a challenge to get them to stick together straight. The experience would&#39;ve been a lot better if they just used a bunch of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6382577/plate-1x1x2-3"">1X1X2/3 plates</a>&nbsp;instead! Would&#39;ve made the set more attractive to part collectors as well. Other than that, I didn&#39;t really have much of an issue with any of the other components.</p>

<p>While building the set, after each bag, you add a jewel to a black platform. I don&#39;t really get this and don&#39;t think it adds much value to the process or set as a whole - Might be fun for kids though.</p>

<p>The sonic minifig&nbsp;is really nice, but Robotnik&#39;s nose is a bit odd. I would&#39;ve expected a somewhat more prominent nose and moustache. My favourite part of the set is definitely the two enemies and the computers - I love the SNOT techniques used here.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a really nice display piece to have, as long as you&#39;re into videogames.</p>

"Ivo_tje","2022-12-12T08:26:25.02Z","A fantastic set for those who played Sonic a lot!","<p>I saw this set in the shop and my daughter said I needed it for my office, so we bought it.</p>

<p>The set has a LOT of tiny parts, no 1x1 bricks, just 2 plates stacked to keep the side view close to the game in the 90&#39;s. But after I build bag 1 i really laughed out loud. Not noticed before, I made the stand for the Sonic minifig which had 7 holed in front of him to place the emeralds in. Every part of the build gave one, such a nice detail in this set (but why didn&#39;t they put them in 7 bags instead of 6?)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a slow build due to all the tiny parts, but the detail in the stage, the enemies is all making it worth to take the time and build, 1 emerald after another. Ofcourse you gotta build Dr. Robotnik as the final boss to beat! 1 figure even has 2 faces to swap, the screens have 5 in total.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro:</p>

<p>- High level of detail</p>

<p>- Collecting Emeralds</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- Lots of small parts</p>

<p>- 2 sheets of stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now lets grab my MegaDrive/Genesis again and play Sonic!</p>

"Ataliano","2022-12-27T15:25:40.58Z","Back to Green Hill Zone","<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>As a SEGA fan, this set was a must-have in my collection. As soon as I saw it on sale I jumped for it and I started working on it.</p>

<p>The set itself is simple, in landscape format for display. You can even combine more than one set to get a more complete level, however, only this set exists so far, so basically it will be the same thing repeated twice (although you can alter the order of the blocks (loop, jump, etc.).</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>I had already read reviews of this set and all expectations have been met. You&#39;re going to end up hating the 1x1 pieces and with sore fingertips. But it&#39;s worth it.</p>

<p>The set consists of 1,125 pieces, but be careful, a lot of them are 1x1 pieces as well as small pieces in general. So once assembled, the size is quite small compared to other sets with &quot;similar&quot; pieces and similar format (for example, the T-Rex breakout from Jurassic Park).</p>

<p>That said, the construction gets a bit repetitive in terms of having to, in each block, install many 1x1 tiles that alternate to form the game&#39;s mythical colour pattern and give that pixelated feel to the set.</p>

<p>In each bag you&#39;ll be building a different block of the stage, as well as collecting a diamond for Sonic&#39;s display (nice touch).</p>

<p>Although the set itself is simple, it is not lacking in mythical Green Hill Zone details.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The palm tree.</li>
	<li>The bridge with its details</li>
	<li>The jumping jack (and it works too!)</li>
	<li>The mythical looping</li>
	<li>The power-up boxes with up to 5 different designs that you can combine.</li>
	<li>The automatic saving pole.</li>
	<li>The mythical sunflowers.</li>
	<li>And of course, the coveted rings.</li>
</ul>

<p>And more details that you will discover as you assemble the set.</p>

<p>It is one of those sets that is more enjoyable once built than the building process itself, sometimes a bit repetitive, but certainly entertaining.</p>

<h3>The Best</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A lot of detail in a small and compact set.</li>
	<li>A good number of characters for the size of the set (enemies, Dr. Robotnik and his spaceship, plus Sonic).</li>
	<li>Once assembled, it certainly recalls the pixelated graphics of the Mega Drive and the essence of Green Hill Zone.</li>
	<li>The Sonic display with the 7 emeralds, a great detail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Worst</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Considering the recommended retail price, it is a bit expensive for its size (however, it is easy to find bargains).</li>
	<li>Have I already mentioned the 1x1 tiles?</li>
	<li>It would be great if more sets or expansions with new blocks could be produced to expand the scenery without having to buy the same set all over again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly another one of those Ideas sets worth having in your collection if you&#39;ve had the Mega Drive controller in your hands with Sonic music playing in the background (you won&#39;t be able to avoid hearing it in your mind while you assemble it).</p>

<p>The instruction book, as usual, is in keeping with the theme and a further interesting item in the set, with details of the history of the videogame as well as its creators.</p>
