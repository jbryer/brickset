<p><strong>The Ship</strong></p>

<p>Most of the Micorofighters vehicles haven&#39;t been based on capturing a realistic representation or perfectly capturing the ship or vehicle from Star Wars; instead, they&#39;re usually kind of a cartoon version.&nbsp; And that&#39;s all right for me and it&#39;s certainly fine for kids who love the sets.&nbsp; This model is discernable as the Razor Crest ship from The Mandalorian series but only just so.&nbsp; There have been a few MOCs in this size on social media that look a lot better than this.&nbsp; However, after building this set, the Microfighter actually looks better in hand while you swoosh it than it does on the box or in photos.&nbsp; It&#39;s definitely a nice size to play with or sit on your desk.</p>

<p>Building the ship is pretty straightforward as a set this size normally is.&nbsp; There are a good variety of pieces that can be used elsewhere to add angles or greebly details to your own creations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first set I&#39;ve owned with this new type of stud shooters and while they look like they could be fun for a kid to launch at targets or other minifigures, I couldn&#39;t get the stud to do anything other than dribble out of the shooter and immediately drop.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t stay on my model after that and were replaced something resembling the forward cannons.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure!</strong></p>

<p>This Din Djarin minifigure is quite nice.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been a Star Wars fan since 1978 and have loved the Mandalorian series.&nbsp; This minifigure really holds up to the standard of the Star Wars design and mythos.&nbsp; The silver printed Beskar armour pieces really stand out.&nbsp; The silver helmet is fantastic.&nbsp; He also comes with a backpack and pistol blaster.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know why the head is a plain black piece rather than having a printed face, but that is a small complaint since he refuses to take his helmet off, regardless of how hard you try to persuade him.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; The printed arms, legs, printed torso on both sides, and a shiny helmet make this a striking minifigure and I&#39;m glad to have him.</p>

<p>I certainly recommend this set to anyone who is remotely a Star Wars fan or The Mandalorian fan.&nbsp; The ship is fun to zip around and you get a great minifigure.</p>

I also like the new&nbsp;&quot;shooters&quot; (part #&nbsp;69754). It&#39;s neat that this fighter has the operating cargo door.</p>

<p>I wish the blaster for Mando was replaced with an Amban Rifle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like this set and the minifigure.</p>

<p>Mandalorian is a mandalorian so that&#39;s cool. Good little figure I didn&#39;t have. I like the gunmetal jetpack and the armour printing is fantastic and shiny.</p>

<p>As far as the build goes, it was not fantastic but it&#39;s a tiny set so that is expected.</p>

<p>Parts are great though for my uses. Good selection of grey parts and some more rare stuff, like the grey bb8 heads. Nice new modern parts too, some new technic bricks and plates.</p>

<p>Stud shooters look f****** stupid but that&#39;s life.</p>

We needed a Razor Crest Microfighter from the second we saw in it Chapter One. I think they did a fantastic job with the build and the overall design is excellent. I love that you can sit Mando in the front with his jetpack still on and that the back loading ramp can actually come down. I also love that you can get Beskar Armor Mando in a $10 set. And I won&#39;t complain about the face print since we have that now. Instead, I can now complain about not having a hair piece, hah! I&#39;m also kind of surprised that LEGO hasn&#39;t tried to increase the price of Microfighters considering they&#39;ve been around for ten years now and that battle packs have been increased.&nbsp;</p>
