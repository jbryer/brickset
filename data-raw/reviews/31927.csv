Stock photos don&#39;t quite do it justice; this set feels bigger than it actually is. Maybe it&#39;s the big stompy boots. Maybe it&#39;s the massive fists. Maybe it&#39;s the wide triangular torso that gives an intimidating power. All I know is, this looks the part of a super robot.</p>

<p>The colour scheme is a perfect fit, restricted to bright primary colours and black/grey to really capture a classic feeling. It feels like such notable mechs as Mazinger Z and Voltron in that respect; it really pops. It also makes great use of the variety of small shaping pieces Lego has introduced over the years, with strong shapes making up its silhouette, and little color details (like the small yellow bits peeking out in the chest) really accent it and help push the illusion of a truly mighty robot. The only somewhat weak point, perhaps the only actual concession to its size, is its head. It&#39;s a good head, and it really captures the overall feel, but it is sad that it doesn&#39;t have a proper face. But even that feels like a minor quibble in an amazing model.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate Model 1: Plane</strong></p>

<p>When you think alternate model of a super robot, a plane is probably not your first thought, but it works. By leaning into the same sentai styling as the primary model, as well as incorporating the same wing pattern as it, it feels like the kind of vehicle our hero would pilot that combines to form the torso of our mighty robot.</p>

<p>The shaping on the jet is phenomenal. Very swooshable, very elegant. The patterning on it is wonderful too; no color feels slapped on or mismatched. The color blocking is on point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a plane made out of the pieces of a super robot, and yet it&#39;s a really, really good plane.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate Model 2: Dragon</strong></p>

<p>The dragon is the weakest model in the set, but don&#39;t take that to mean it&#39;s bad; rather, the super robot and the plain are just so spectacular that it stands out by virtue of being just a little bit awkward. It&#39;s largely the wings, which I wish had more heft, but it probably would have been difficult without using the larger red wings, which would go against the designer&#39;s intent.</p>

<p>Speaking of, I didn&#39;t mention it with the plane, but it&#39;s astonishing that the two alternate models can exclude one of the primary colors from their color schemes and still form completely cohesive models. Limiting himself to only a set selection of the pieces and still knocking it out of the park is a great feat.</p>

<p>I want to be clear that just because I&#39;m calling it the weakest, that doesn&#39;t mean I think the dragon is bad. Rather, it evokes several classic robot dragons, such as Deathsaurus from Transformers Victory (though I doubt that was a specific influence; I just don&#39;t have many others off the top of my head.) The black, teal, and yellow color scheme sells it well, giving it just a slightly sinister edge over the robot and the jet. And again, the color blocking is fantastic, though perhaps not as much as the other two models. Still, it&#39;s a very strong model in its own regard.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>A fantastic set, perhaps not in spite of, but because of its small size. Each model has a gravitas beyond their somewhat diminutive size, capturing the essence of their inspirations perfectly. And being a $10 set, it&#39;s the perfect size to buy impulsively as a little treat, as I have. I would recommend this for any fans of mecha or robots in general. It&#39;s just such a delight.</p>
