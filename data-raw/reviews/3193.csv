Pros:
- Very detailed helicopter (has jet turbine engines in addition to chopper blades)
- Helicopter has room to hold 2 minifigs in the center area plus the helicopter driver up front
- Pontoons for water landings
- Rope winch and basket for saving drowning victims
- 3 Minifigs
- Cool sailboat

Cons:
It may have been a bit pricey new but as a used set now-a-days it can't be beat.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BrickTVReviews","2012-10-11T06:44:58.98Z","Perfect helicopter with additional touches!","<p>I recently bought 99% of this set from Bricklink for $13. Considering the MSRP for this set [$17.5] You can't afford to miss this set-especially if your an avid Lego City collector. Despite the seller lost one of the figures and the order didn't come with the box and instructions, this set has it's place in my heart. [the nostalgic design...]</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts included in this set are great, and rare! Some of the bricks I haven't seen before. It's a great parts pack and contains duplicates of 1x1 bricks. 8/10</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are plain, that's it. The surfer's torso are plain. TLG can do better than this... [but it's 1993 ;] 5/10</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build wasn't boring, the design was perfect. That's all I could say. You won't disappointed. 8/10</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is all-round perfect. The finished model does look blocky though. The rope winch can keep me up for a long time, providing great playability. The cabin contains space enough to fit up to 2 minifigures, not including the cockpit-which can fit 1 minifigure. The little boat-thingy is also perfect, though it can't float. 10/10</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Buy this. For under $15 for a used one, it's still a great deal. This is the missing link between safety and the coastline of Lego City ;) 9/10</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5

<p>I got this set as part of used lot of 90s Lego I purchased a while ago. It came with a lot of instructions and this set, among others.</p>

<p>The build itself is nothing really fancy. I mean, it&#39;s 90s lego. Instructions were a bit simpler as well, and you really have to look at every step to not miss a part. Every Lego set was simple back then, stick a couple plates together and voil&agrave;, you have yourself a vehicle to play with.</p>

<p>I was really pleasantly surprised with the final result of this helicopter. I&#39;m not particularly a fan of them in general, but it just looks excellent. Even the little boat is extremely simple in its design but is perfect as it is.</p>

<p>Feature wise, you have a cockpit you can open, rotors on top and at the back and a winch to drop your rescuer to help the poor bastard that fell in the water.</p>

<p>Really cool little build overall that will look nice in any beach/sea setting, even in a modern city layout. IMO a must-have for any 90s lego collector.</p>
