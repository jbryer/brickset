But before re-using I built the main vignet with the dolfin and the turtle.&nbsp;<br />
That is a fine nice little experience with good part-use and: the way both animals flote above the service is nice!&nbsp;<br />
With the new piece is light blue 67810 in medium azure&nbsp;I guess this is a little set AFOL&#39;s will like as much as the kids, for which the 3 builds are nice.</p>

<p>This is the first time, I&#39;ve bought a 3-in-1 set. I like that there&#39;s more than one ay to build it. What could be helpful is to indicate more clearly which version is easier and which one is harder.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What I liked about it:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>- 3-in-1 Different ideas / designs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Creative set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What I didn&#39;t like about it:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>- Fish was complicated. (even for me - maybe I have a hard time visualizing)</p>

<p>- I felt this set was a bit lonely. Maybe good that goes well with the fish tank set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it was a good bit of fun with my daugher.&nbsp;</p>
