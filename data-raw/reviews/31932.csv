<p>Building experience:</p>

<p>The build&nbsp;was split into 4 numbered bags, so I didn&#39;t have to spread all the pieces out at once, which was nice. First constructed was the body, then the legs, and then it finished with the head and the tail. After that, the final handful of pieces were used to build up a small waterfall with some foliage and a bird.&nbsp;There were some cool building techniques along the way, including good use of the ball joints to secure the section of the body containing the stripes at a nice angle, and some creative parts usage for the legs. The entire set took roughly 2 hours to build. It was fun throughout, but a little repetitive with the 2 pairs of identical legs and body sections.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Nothing about the parts in this set really jumped off the page to me, but there are six printed double cheese slopes that are orange with black stripes. The set comes with 755 parts, but it doesn&#39;t quite feel like that much when building and once the entire set is constructed.</p>

<p>The Finished Product:</p>

<p>The tiger was very decently sized, about a foot long if you include the tail, and the amount of detail on it is&nbsp;spectacular. The designers got it right with the flowing body and overall shaping. Smaller details like using pointy white pieces to represent spiky fur, interesting techniques for the stripes on&nbsp;the body, and even a pink flower piece for the tiger&#39;s butthole show a lot of dedication and effort went into this set. In particular, the head and face of the tiger look extremely life-like. The bird and rock/waterfall area is also well done, complementing the colours of the tiger well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>While there isn&#39;t too much playability to be had with a large tiger that isn&#39;t fit to minifig&nbsp;scale,&nbsp;the posability&nbsp;of this set was super impressive. The tiger&#39;s head can be tilted from side to side, but it also can be completely flipped upside down. The tail can be posed pretty much anyway you want, and the legs and torso can be adjusted enough to get a solid variety of poses. Because the many sections of the build are all connected by ball joints, it&#39;s very easy to get a wide range&nbsp;of motion. The only drawback is that the hind legs can only move up so far since pieces on the torso are blocking it. Even then, it doesn&#39;t limit the movement too much to be an issue.</p>

<p>Value for money:</p>

<p>In the US this set retails for $50, which is how much I bought it for. Considering the amount of pieces (755) the price is solid, but there are a lot of small pieces that go into it. I feel like they could have made it $40, but the rebuildability between the tiger and the other 2 models certainly adds a lot of extra value. Overall, I am fine with the price even though I feel like it could&#39;ve&nbsp;been slightly cheaper.</p>

<p>Overall:&nbsp;</p>

<p>31129 Majestic Tiger is probably the best Creator 3-in-1 set on the market right now and maybe one of the greatest in the entire theme&#39;s history. The amount of detail throughout the build cannot be matched by any other 3-in-1 set, and it even is comparable with Creator Expert sets in terms of how much effort was put into it. I would recommend buying it even at full price due to how displayable it is as a model. Even if you don&#39;t like the tiger, the red panda and koi fish alternate builds are extremely solid, and I think the red panda could even be its own set. At $50, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed by the quality of this marvellous set.</p>
