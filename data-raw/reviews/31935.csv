The main model seemed nice, but the B and C models looked so bad I doubted I would even want to build them. But then a big discount came along, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting a Viking ship in my collection&hellip;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Let&rsquo;s start with the A model: the Viking ship with serpent. It&rsquo;s big, colourful and looks striking. But closer inspection quickly reveals its flaws:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level=""1"" style=""list-style-type:disc""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The hull is nicely shaped, except for 2 plate corners in the front and back sticking out, messing up the curves in the interior. They were given a function by attaching fish/torches, but it&rsquo;s a poor attempt at fixing the issue.</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level=""1"" style=""list-style-type:disc""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">There are no oars. I get it&rsquo;s fantasy (the serpent being there and all) but a Viking ship needs oars. Maybe they decided it would be weird with only 4 minifigs included?</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level=""1"" style=""list-style-type:disc""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">There is no rudder either. Even my 9-year-old nephew picked up on that.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">What I do like about this model are the animals: the cow and ravens are cute, and I like the serpent more than I expected. Even though there is no articulation in about half its body, poseability is good and it towers over the ship.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Due to the symmetry of the ship, the building process was rather dull. It doesn&rsquo;t come close to the recent pirate ship 3 in 1, which is a joy both to build and behold.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Then on to the B and C models: they really are atrocious. It happens more often that the alternative models are not very good, but here they hit a new low. There are bits sticking out and holes where there shouldn&rsquo;t be. I&rsquo;d say the designers were scraping the bottom of the barrel for pieces to come up with something passable and couldn&rsquo;t manage. At least the wolf has some play value (though has limited articulation) but leaves an awful lot of pieces unused. I get it&rsquo;s only a 3 in 1 because it wouldn&rsquo;t fit another theme, but for me the alternative models are usually a big draw, so I fully take them into account for my final score. And I found little joy in building them and even less looking at the result.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">My conclusion: unless you really want a Viking ship and can&rsquo;t track down the old 7018 at a fair price, you are probably better off buying other sets. There is no 3 in 1 value here and the ship itself is flawed.</span></span></p>
