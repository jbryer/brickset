"footballfever70","2006-01-11T02:19:18Z","Essential!","This set is an essential part of any police force.  It has the best mid-sized police boat and a sleek fast plane.  This is the team that chases after the bad guys in 1687 Midnight Transport and 6679 after they do whatever bad things they do in my town.  Very fun, lots of playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"piratetown","2007-08-02T10:57:38.677Z","plane?","The boat is boss, and I agree that there is great playability value. My gripe with the plane was that the top was not slanted like the passenger planes, so convertibility was poor - flat roof on passenger plane is not ideal. Didn't like the massive windshield, which has very limited use. Still, at least the front of the plane wasn't emblazoned,  and jet engines and large wings are always useful. Average set, and I still dig the boat.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-14T18:40:48.747Z","The First Owned Set for Me (and my brother)","Although it was for my brother, this set was great. It made my brother buy more Lego sets and influenced me to get Lego sets to this day. The boat is very cool and the engine is nice too. The police jet is very cool although I haven't seen a police jet in real life. The pop out camera is wicked cool. If it wasn't for this set, I would not be on Brickset today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cityboy518ipswich","2011-02-14T13:19:25.287Z","A Great Town Set, Well Worth Picking Up","<h4>The Price:</h4>
<p>Okay,&nbsp;I got this off bricklink for Â£4.89 with the planes stickers missing and no box,therefore I won't do a box section. I thought that was dirt cheap!</p>
<h4>The Build:</h4>
<p>A good Solid Build with an interesting technique used for the planes camera, using some hinge pieces. Other than that, a fairly standard build but a fun one.</p>
<h4>The Minifigs:</h4>
<p>You Get Two Minifigs. One pilot and one boat driver, unfortunately, the previous owner had replaced a torso with an older torso! Anyway i love both of their faces, especially the pilots as he looks so chilled!</p>
<h4>The Finished model</h4>
<p>I really like this set, it offers two vehicles for a good price (well, I paid a good price)</p>
<p>But, overall I'd give it a 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
