<p>This set includes three minifigures:&nbsp;an imperial at-st driver, a rebel hoth trooper, and chewbacca with snow. The at-st driver is a pretty good minifigure. It has nice printing on the front, back and legs, and a double-sided face including happy and angry expressions. The rebel hoth trooper is also a pretty god minifigure, but it lacks leg printing. It includes a white backpack, and a helmet with goggles that can be placed either over the face, or on the helmet.&nbsp;It also has a double-sided face, with a smile on one side and a scowl on the other. chewbacca, which is by far my favourite minifigure in this set, has great printing to show snow all over him. It comes with the usual moulded head/body piece, which looks good but is nothing new, and a stud-shooting bowcaster. All over the head/body piece, and the legs are little dots of white to represent snow. It also has toe printing with snow. I really like this figure, and I think it looks great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Build&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are two builds in this set: the main build, which is the at-st walker, and a smaller imperial probe droid. The imperial probe droid is a good build, and is very detailed and accurate to source material. It comes on a clear stick attached to a white wedge plate. I would have liked something more to represent snow, but this is okay. The at-st is great. It has many improvements over previous lego at-st models, including much more detail on the feet, a new design for the head, which is more accurate, and much stronger connections for the blaster cannons and rocket launcher on the sides. This build is also very accurate to source material and looks very good on display. It would also go very well with the ucs at-at walker that was released on Black Friday last year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>There are a few really cool play features to this set. My favourite&nbsp;is how you can rotate the head by spinning a&nbsp;small knob on the back of the walker. It has a full 360 degrees of movement, and looks great. There are also two spring-loaded shooters in the head of the walker, activated by pressing small sticks&nbsp;on the back, and then there is also the stud shooter built into chewbacca&#39;s bowcaster. There is space inside the walker for the at-st driver, and clips for his two accessories (a blaster pistol, and a pair of white binoculars). On the top of the walker you can open a small hatch to the interior, which is accurate to source material, and you can also open up the whole top to get into the interior easier. The one thing that disappoints me about this set is the legs. The can move backwards, but it can not move forwards. This frustrates me because the hinge that is used for the lags can move forward, but it is blocked by part of the legs, which makes it difficult to create accurate poses, other than just standing still. This has been a problem with previous lego at-st models,&nbsp;and I was hoping it would be fixed here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>I think the value for this set is great. It has a great price per piece ratio, and includes three very good-looking figures and many fun features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I think that this is a really great set, despite the problems with leg movement. It has a lot of great details, and is definitely worth getting if you are a Star Wars fan, and especially if you have the ucs at-at, because it goes very well with that.&nbsp;</p>

"SleeplesSSP","2022-05-30T03:36:01.437Z","I did the math. ","<p>The UCS AT-AT, while not perfectly-accurate, seems to draw a pretty well-defined standard for &quot;minifig-scale.&quot; It straddles the line between a playlet and a collector&#39;s item, and opened the door for 2022 to have a rapid influx of new Hoth sets to coincide with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So when they announced a new LEGO AT-ST, my first thought was &quot;Is this supposed to go with the AT-AT?&quot; After all, the new scale made previous, smaller AT-ST&#39;s look absolutely pitiful by comparison, and the release dates were too convenient to be anything but a planned display opportunity. Well, that, and our last model had very limited play options, demanding you display it with your Mandalorian sets and nothing else with its design.</p>

<p>So I cracked out my Star Wars handbooks, poured sweat over a calculator, and came to a final conclusion: this model would have to be roughly 2/5 the height of the UCS AT-AT.</p>

<p>The UCS AT-AT clocks in at 65cm, and this set is 26cm high, almost perfectly on-point. Between this, the UCS AT-AT, and the Snowtrooper battlepack, we finally have a great minifigure-scale Hoth display in the works, perhaps as an apology for the UCS Echo Base. LEGO really went out of their way with the accuracy of this set, and the only thing holding it back from being an addition to the UCS collection is the price point, a mere $50.</p>

<p>So to finish this long-winded preface to my review: yes, this set does serve as a great scale comparison to your brand-new UCS AT-AT, and you&#39;ll definitely want it if you have that set on display.</p>

<p>Now, as for the actual review.</p>

<p>I love this set. The included figures are great, the Probe Droid is something I&#39;ve always wanted from a LEGO set, and the new Chewbacca design with the snow particles in his fur is a cute addition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The part usage in this set is great, and aside from building many parts twice for symmetry, the design looks fantastic to boot. Something obviously meant to be compared to a UCS needs to look the part, and this set does not disappoint. The two included troopers, a rebel and an imperial respectively, are some of those nicer, more movie-accurate ones we&#39;ve seen as of late, and the fact that the AT-ST itself has holsters for the pilot&#39;s props is a blessing. On top of this, the inclusion of Chewbacca might also be a nod to the original AT-ST set, which featured him taking one over on Endor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a fantastic new addition to my shelf and now I have to save up for an AT-AT to do it justice. Thanks, LEGO. &nbsp;</p>

However, this is a very nice Lego set. This is there first lego Star Wars set in a while that I have built that does not use stickers for detailing which is very good. The difference between this and a normal AT-ST is the feet build, the enclosed smaller head, and the weaponry at the sides. The probe droid build is also the best one they have ever made. The Chewbacca with snow speckles looks very good when compared to the movie and is exclusive to this set. I think that a snowtrooper or another Rebel solider should have been included in this set as it just does not feel worth it for $50 to only get 3 minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

"Captainfives1514","2023-03-24T20:23:34.913Z","Blink and You will Miss It","<p>I got this set a little while ago on discount from Walmart. I was initially sceptical of this set seeing how it only appears in the film The Empire Strikes Back for a second. I finally caved once the set went on discount and picked one up.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>AT-ST Pilot; the pilot has the typical double-headed imperial pilot face. He&#39;s wearing the Mudtrooper helmet from 2018. He wears typical Imperial AT-ST pilot fatigues except in white. He carries a blaster pistol.</p>

<p>Rebel Officer; the only unique thing about her is her head. Other than that she is wearing the typical Hoth officer uniform. She is carrying a blaster rifle.</p>

<p>Chewbacca; the only unique thing about Chewbacca is that he has is snow speckled. He carries his&nbsp;typical crossbow.</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>It is the typical AT-ST build. Other than it has no windows. I like how they&#39;ve added the barricade cutters instead of relying on stickers.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised at this set and am glad to add it to my collection. I would defiantly recommend this set to Hoth collectors.&nbsp;</p>
