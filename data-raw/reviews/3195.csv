You get two of some of the best small proeller planes ever produced by lego! They have exotic radial engine parts and I really charish the monoplane! This plane is like the only lego world war 2 fightercraft! The planes are an instant plus, the bi-plane is just like any other, but it has unique colors and the pilot minifigures are nice. As another plus, you get fence pieces and a very nice conssession stand on wheels! Basically like a trailer. This is a free set to get and it isnt all that expensive (I havent checked it on bricklink these days though. I strongly urge anobody who wants two great planes to buy this set!

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T11:29:59.983Z","The complete airshow experience","This four-part set is a real treat. Not only does it include two extremely well-made propeller aircraft, ones that fully justify buying this set on their own, it also features a unique van/trailer combo and a set of spectators. 

The aircraft are virtually flawless. The bulky engines and details such as the exhaust pipes on the biplanes really do make them look like high-power stunt aircraft. The red, white and blue colour scheme - the same one used for the gorund vehicles - works really well, too and is even continued in the flight uniforms and helmets.

The van and trailer are enjoyable in their own right, with realistic touches such as a cash register and a even rear lights.

With a dozen minifigs, some with their own tools, this set is a steal.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-09T17:34:06.857Z","My First Lego Set","This was the first set I got back in 1995. I still have it intact and put together. Over the years it had worn out, and white pieces became yellowish in colour. This set is very stable(unlike some newer sets) and fun to play with, since it is not one big structure(like building or huge vehicle). Since it consists of two planes, truck, and trailer, it does not have to be all together to have good playability. 

Pros:
-Two cool stunt planes 
-6 minifigures(2 pilots, cashier, 2 spectators and air traffic regulator)
-Trailer can be opened in a very nice way
-Fence pieces that are not very common
-Very good playability
-Good in city layout
-Phone piece in the trailer which is hard to get

Cons:
-Could use more accesories(eg. money, cups and maybe pizza piece)
-Some stickers can fall off over time

Overall this is a very nice set to have. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"cbowers","2011-06-11T22:35:50.703Z","A fun set that is for enjoyment in most surroundings","<p>Starting off, you have to look at what this set brings to the table. It brings a traveling Air Show. That can work in almost any play setting. I did aquire this set while I was young from my Uncle as a Christmas gift. The fact that I had no other Legos with me at the time of construction made the value of this set stand out even more. I was able to have air shows in just about any room of the house with my travelling Air Show. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over all it's a fun set and the planes are put together the old style...aka with smaller pieces which makes the build more fun. The planes also do resemble some prop planes seen in society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think the availability of this set really will help anyone reading this out. But, I wish that someone could buy it for their own enjoyment from someone at a decent cost. It is fun for kids especially.&nbsp; Every city needs an airport to have an air show occaisonally as well. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Side Note: The vending truck and cart also could be used at state fairs and the like. It's a good way for them to promote their air shows year round and serve corn dogs and the like. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this post wasn't too technical, but I tried to show enthusiasm for a great set. It has been a while since I have seen portions of this set in my collection. The Trailer is not assembled, probably due to a grease fire that occured while they were making corndogs. </p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"brixton","2009-09-03T19:41:52.81Z","Soaring Eagles","I know a lot of users here are not a big fan of stickers (I'm not fond of them either) but I love the Eagle stickers in this set.  The only downside is that they go on multiple pieces on the truck.  The truck, trailer and planes are amazing in this set.  What really got me interested in this set when I first got it back in 1993 was the lego ladies.  That was the first time I had seen female minifigures.  6 minifigures is a great value for this set. 

The truck in this set is a bit small by today's standards.  I compared it with the sports car that is currently out and the bus in the City Corner.  The sports car is longer than the truck if I remember correctly and the bus is just plain huge.  The set seems a bit incomplete with just the green pieces and the fence for the viewing area.  It feels like there should be a little more to this set.  A pilots lounge perhaps.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"carl86","2017-09-02T20:50:07.783Z","Amazing Set!","<p>I got this set as a present back in 1994 when I was still an 8 year old kid.</p>

<p>Being an aviation enthusiast (even back then) I immediately loved building the 2 planes in this set, especially the monoplane! The biplane is similar to many other biplanes by Lego but I especially love the design and build of the&nbsp;blue engine part (#4616).</p>

<p>As regards to playability I remember playing with this set in every available space around the house (different airshows in different &#39;venues&#39;).</p>

<p>23 years on I still own the set. Some stickers have fallen off due to wear and tear and some parts have turned yellow due to age. Nevertheless this is an amazing set which was part of my childhood where Lego is involved!</p>
