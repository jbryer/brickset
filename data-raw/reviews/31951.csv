<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The body is incredibly dense and solid. Layer upon layer of plates, with very few small pockets of empty space. The curved front portion is equally solid, though an entirely separate build, connected via ball joints. Their connection is fairly secure, but supplemented with plates after attachment, so there&#39;s absolutely no wiggle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The raised 1x2 plate on the hood is irritating; it has no notches to center it over the stud, so in addition to being &quot;spinnable,&quot; it&#39;s also &quot;slidable.&quot; Eyeballing its position is the best you can do.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The two stickers on the front curved plates are almost criminal. Anyone can place a sticker, but placing it <em>well </em>is another story, and stickers this long and narrow, over such a wide curve, are all but impossible to line up perfectly. The stickers on the engines are an irritation, but with patience and a steady hand, they can be placed perfectly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All three engines look great, especially the port engine with its missing cowl. Each engine is attached with a different mechanism, and all three are terrible. The port engine is the most solidly attached, using Technic pins. It still wobbles, but barely. The starboard engine inexplicably uses three white lightsaber rods, resulting in a very wobbly connection. The top engine uses Technic pins as well, but sits too loosely on them, resulting in the worst wobble of the three. All three of these issues could have been fixed by adding plates to the mix to shore up the rigidity of the connections.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The silver tubes running along the sides look brilliant, but they barely fit. The vertical space is ever-so-slightly too small for the stack of five, so one of them is always trying to burst free. And they&#39;re just a tiny bit too short -- they fit as shown, but sliding them just a millimeter or two in either direction can be enough to cause one to spring loose. The pressure they exert on the front &quot;grill&quot; piece is considerable, but that piece is well attached and won&#39;t break free. (The greeble bits decorating the grill are <em>not </em>well attached, and when one of the tubes sprang free, I eventually found the tiny piece across the room.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Additionally, the area behind the tubes along the front curved section is empty, so colored bricks are visible behind them. The embedded horizontal ladders on either side look good and arguably help keep the tubes in place, but they aren&#39;t fixed solidly and swing to and fro at a touch.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The back panels (beneath the rear engine), attached via SNOT, are reasonably solid but also wobble slightly.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As a display piece the wobbliness of the engines likely won&#39;t matter, but for this extremely premium price, it&#39;s reasonable to expect better, especially considering how fixable this problem would have been during development.</p>

<p>The completed model is a striking piece. Even after seeing lots of images, I was surprised at how big it is. It&#39;s truly a fantastic rendition of Luke&#39;s landspeeder. Its substantial weight is incredibly satisfying to hold. The exclusive C-3PO minifigure is also a treat; kudos to Lego for getting the front/side prints of his feet lined up so precisely.</p>
