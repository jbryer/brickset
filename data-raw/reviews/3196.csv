Pros:
2 motorcycles
5 mini-figs
1 shuttle
and the truck carrier

Cons:
Stickers
too many yellow lights

This is a must have set for all you Space Shuttle fans out there.  I got all the space shuttles that came out and this is a great addition because all the other shuttles with the same logo can fit fine on the truck as well",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-05-05T17:42:07Z","great in every view","This is a great set. In my old early 80&#180;s city, it needs the whole street - police men and fire officers have to make sure the shuttle will be transported without problems. They even have to close the streets for it ;)

This set comes with a lot of usable pieces. I like the design of the shuttle, and i am curious if it is different to other sets. Lots of figures and lovely yellow lights ;)

Its an eyecatcher in the city. And - what i do like the best - all the minifigs have the standard grin ( i am so old fashioned, i dont like most of the custom faced figures)

The only point disturbing me is the black visor of the shuttle captain - he has to fly blind when its shut down. Well, 5/5, lot of playability and great design.

I would have loved it when i was a child, and its still impressing to me old man nowadays.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-09T14:41:59.123Z","Nasa Convoy","<p>Shuttle launches were one of the most exciting things in the 1980s&nbsp;and the interest in Nasa for many kids continued in to the 1990s. There we got the first foray in to Town space programs and the chance to join the Town and Space themes much more in&nbsp;games.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;]</strong><strong>[&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>I rarely mark sets down for&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;and won&#39;t here, they are functional and uniformed as you might expect, bike riders in blue and white, drivers in red with caps but the astronaut could have been better in all white and some detail or bulk to him. Perhaps its a cosmonaut after all?</p>

<p><strong>Heavy Fuel</strong><br />
I must admit, I absolutely love this set, what a great low-loader for 1992 and the bulk and design of it gives the impression of a large truck and its important super-heavy load. This would have been fine even without the small pick up that carries blue lights, a radio and the space program symbol like the tractor cab and shuttle. The two escort bikes are really chunky with the added plates, lights and antenna, also with beacon lights too.</p>

<p>The shuttle is really great as a strong build with small skateboard like wheels and substantial undercarriage. The enclosed main compartment houses a nifty little satellite or rather a probe. The pilot is firmly locked into the front cockpit and the build includes a retractable arm and claw to release the probe. The hinged sides open outwards both side for this operation. The rear has 2 lovely large boosters and 2 smaller converted turbine types also very good. The tail, wing and side badges look really smart.</p>

<p>I left the lorry as best last. The chunky grill is the best front of most 4-stud Town truck cabs&nbsp;and has double front lights and a smattering of hazard lights over the cab roof. It gets air horns, large exhaust&nbsp;pipes, chunky red fuel tanks and a chunky 5-stud wide cabin that the driver would feasibly sleep in. This is achieved with the use of offset plates or &#39;jumper&#39; plates, used innovatively here and&nbsp;years before widespread use for squeezing more passengers in to cars. The rear lights and tyre&nbsp;choices are also very suitable. The low loader trailer is a lengthy build to take the shuttle and has fold out stabiliser legs, a technic ball and socket&nbsp;peg connection, saftey barriers and beacon lights. Again the rear looks good with the safety red and white hazard tile between the lights. The small wheels were used perfectly for the low loader and get a smooth, smart wheel arch covering.<br />
<br />
<strong>We&#39;re Leaving Together</strong><br />
Looking at the range I would argue this is among&nbsp; the better sets available from spaceport related releases. I never got the launch pad or piggy back jet aeroplane&nbsp;but this was satisfying enough for its high design and detail. Definitely recommended for collectors of spaceport subthemes and a top building experience as far as classic Town vehicles are concerned,&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t really get better.</p>

"J_tje","2010-03-14T06:26:20.14Z","En Route to Baykonur Cosmo Drome?","This set is the second release in the Town/Launch Command Series. It was released in 1992 as a follow up on the 1990 space shuttle launching set (1682) which was great. Not very Legolike the 1682 space shuttle had USA markings. This set doesn't... it looks more Russian in a way.... The Shuttle itself is small, and has weird wheels. The minifig are all wearing red (except the bikers) and even the cosmonaut is wearing a red helmet with dark visor. <br><br>The truck seems bulky and square (not a pretty shight) and the included car is not that original either. The trucks loading part is ok, too bad it doesn't fit the later model space shuttles. <br><br>Compared to the rest of the sets in this series I come to a 3 overall rating. Which is too bad because the concept is nice....<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"James83","2012-08-12T11:52:17.97Z","Wide Load!","<p>This was the only Shuttle set I brought, it was probably the cheapest Shuttle set at that time. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p>The star of the set is the Shuttle. I'd agree its not as nice as some of the later shuttles but this looks the part. It features a black nose and forward lower fuselage to simulate heat-shielding tiles, has two large booster engines and two smaller rocket engines and a tailfin. The wings have logo flat tiles (stickers not printed) but the undercarriage is basic and quite ugly.&nbsp;The cockpit is pretty spartan and to get the MF in and out you need to remove the forward portion of the roof. Basically he's a pilot&nbsp;and space-walks aren't really intended.&nbsp;The cargo bay contains an arm and a satelite which looks pretty good. Oddly the box had useage instructions for a pole-like 'Canada Arm' but my example came with a multi-jointed flexi-arm with a grab on the end. It held the payload well enough in certain positions but was fiddly. The cargo bay doors proved fairly sturdy. The side stickers were quite snazzy but looking back now the markings seem a bit dated.</p><p>The truck was one of the first US-style rigs and was copied later on with other sets. I liked the provision of rear cab windows (pity it wasn't beig enough for the driver to sleep in!) and the bull-bars gave some street presence. The exhaust stacks, roof horns and diesel tanks&nbsp;were nice touches too. It is overloaded with lights though, I mean, any Lego citizen will this truck coming from ten miles away!</p><p>The trailer is much bigger than on previous truck sets and I loved the multi-wheel layout and the use of the flat smooth bricks as a wheelarch. The Shuttle sits on the front sloped brick and rear barrier brick ok and is stable. The trailer has light beacons too.</p><p>The support truck is a basic pickup with sunroof, blue light bar and more yellow lights on poles at the back. The bonnet has a sticker logo on it. It has the same neat white and blue scheme of the truck.</p><p>Two motorbikes complete the set, these have big pannier-type sides with grills and a 2x3 brick topping them off. The bikes also blue lights and yet more yellow lights on poles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Two drivers with red zipper&nbsp;uniforms and red baseball caps, two motorcycle riders with white zipper coats, blue legs and blue helmets and one spaceman with white zipper suit with a red helmet with a black visor. I've often wondered why the spaceman has a black visor, it sort of looked cool but when he's in space he can't see anything. Also, I felt making him ride in the shuttle as it drives to the launch pad was mean, you get the feeling he'll get claustrophobia in there if he's up on a long mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>I gave the pickup truck some bigger wheels to make it look a little less van-like. I was pleased with this set but felt it had a few flaws. The spaceman was locked in his cockpit and the arm was a little fiddly. I made a few other payloads too. Having the remove the wheels for more realistic spaceflight was a pain too. The ground vehicles are good solid types and look the part but the excess of yellow lights on every vehicle and on poles and roofs kind of spoils the effect. If you haven't got&nbsp;a launching pad then one can easily be built from scratch to your own design, but as a street piece scenario it makes a nice addition and is an excuse to gather a crowd. It's doesn't go too well with the Space sets, they being more sci-fi but it gives some good space action if your not a fan of the Space theme. I'd agree though that the later Shuttle sets are probably better looking and the later logo was nicer too. It's dated but still could be a good addition.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4

The shuttle looks fantastic and the play-features are really fun. My only qualm is that the shuttle pilot doesn&#39;t look like an astronaut. I don&#39;t think that torso-printing was up to that level when this set was released, but it was still a little curious. 4/5 overall.</p>
