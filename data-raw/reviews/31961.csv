<p>The mech is very green and has gold accents which gives&nbsp;it a nice&nbsp;feel&nbsp;and is fun to build, although you&#39;ll be done quickly due to how little pieces there are, the arms and legs can be posed pretty well, so you can position Lloyd to hold a pose&nbsp;whilst fighting the snake!</p>

<p>My main issue is that the legs are very bland due to only having 3 pieces making it 90% 1 shade of green, maybe adding a light green or gold round 2x2 tiles to the side of the knee areas&nbsp;would fix it.</p>

<p>The side build looks pretty good for how few pieces it has. The addition of the spider really adds to it.</p>

<p>The minifigures also are quite decent. I like how many shades of green this version of Lloyd has on him with both arms being different shades of green. The snake also has a pretty cool design, but I don&#39;t know if I like the grey and orange combination on it, it kinda clashes.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it&#39;s a pretty decent 4+ core set especially for the &pound;9 price point</p>
