I was wrong. Like REALLY Wrong. This set is WORSE than the Kai&#39;s Fire&nbsp; Dragon EVO. Ok,let me tell you why.</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigures are okay. That&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>The build-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dragons wings are HORRIBLE. The wings are tiny and made out of plastic. The head is great,however.The tail is too tiny and the body looks weird. Anyway-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DO not buy this set UNLESS you are 4+ or something. Because it is BAD.</p>

<p>But,i do not like criticising sets too much,so i&#39;m just gonna say don&#39;t buy it.</p>
