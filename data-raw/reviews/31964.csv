<p>The minfigures are okay, you get 3. The set looks nice, especially the face. One big problem though: The wings are plastic! I love the lloyd&#39;s legendary dragon,and dare i say,it is my favourite ninjago dragon. But LEGO could have taken out the side build and included the cloth wings instead.Whatever.But this is definetly for a very young audience,and does a good job doing it. Overall,great set for younger people.</p>
