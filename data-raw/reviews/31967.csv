<p>The ultimate set for any fan of Power Rangers, Voltron, <span>Gurren Lagann, </span>GaoGaiGar, Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad, Transformers or whatever combining mech-based TV show you were watching as a child or watching right now. If you ever wanted a combiner mech where each part does stand on its own and can be piloted by one of your favourite ninja... this set is for you! Buy it at any cost, it is worth every penny.</p>

<p>All four original ninjas (Kai, Jay, Cole and Zane) are great and come with their signature weapons and a katana in their secondary colour, sadly no alternative hair pieces are included. A Wu-Bot is there as well, this time with two new stud shooters on top. This guy is funny, but I won&#39;t call him a minifig. The two bad guys are snakes, similar to Seabound&#39;s Maaray Guards but in orange. One of them carries armour and two iron fists.</p>

<p>There are five vehicles in this set: One frog-like jumper for the bad guys has a great colour scheme of bright orange and gun metal gray. It uses some new SCCBS parts that were made for this year&#39;s Core wave of Ninjago sets. On the ninja side you get Kai&#39;s samurai mech, Jay&#39;s flyer, an ice tank for Zane and a twin driller cart for Cole. Instructions tell you exactly what you have to do in order to build and combine these into the Ultra Combo Mech.</p>

<p>The feeling of putting all the vehicles together while the ninjas are still in their seats is indescribable. All the rotating, twisting, detaching, reattaching, folding, you name it... it is easy, secure and just sooo cool.</p>

<p>Although we got many piloted mechs in the last few years (Lloyd&#39;s and Zane&#39;s Titan Mech, Fire-Stone Mech, Legacy Golden Mech, Monkey King Mech, etc.), never did we see a combiner mech in this shape or form. If you want to compare its size to other mechs, it comes close to the Monkey King Mech and the Bone Demon (which is a combiner mech by itself, not piloted, though) but is still no match for Voltron.</p>

<p>The news joints for 2022 - used for the main arms and hips on this mech - work great and allow for better articulation than ever. The mech is stable and doesn&#39;t fall over or anything, which is pretty impressive at this size. The head can be angled up or down and rotated 360 degrees. Both small arms are on ball joints and are able to carry a sword or a gun, if you want to moc one from your own parts.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this set is a dream come true for many fans of Ninjago and LEGO mechs in general. Let&#39;s hope is it not the last one of this calibre. I would like to see these combining features split into different sets, so you can collect the sets you want and create something bigger. Same goes for the antagonists, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to collect all the bad guy vehicles that are spread around a wave of sets like this one and combine it into something greater?</p>

<p>One can dream... until then I will enjoy this beautiful Ultra Combo Mech.</p>

"Steezy","2022-02-07T04:36:26.717Z","Neat idea for a set with GREAT execution","<p>Sure, this set is rated 9+, but this one is most definitely appealing to older fans of Ninjago as well. The 4 vehicles that separate are fun, but the Jay jet/fighter is by far the weakest. The Cole and Zane vehicles are fun parts&nbsp;I could see being standalone sets. The Kai mech has some beefy legs that look rather awkward when not combined into the&nbsp;mech. The combination process is simple, it involves folding assemblies, 1x2 clips, bars, and technic pins. Once you combine the vehicles to assemble the mech for the first time you&#39;ll get the hang of it right away. Note- The Hips and shoulders of the combined mech are new for 2022, they are a new version of the ratchet joint and allow for great articulation. The mech balances pretty well, too. You can get a range of wacky positions to put it in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figures:</strong> The figures (especially Cole and Kai) have some really weird colored legs, and that is a gripe I have with this wave of January 2022&nbsp;Core sets overall. The snakes are rehashed molds but are excellent looking. No need to get all the sets to get every villain, as these snakes are repeated with different weapons throughout the entire wave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:</strong> Each&nbsp;Ninja has a rendition of their Golden weapon from the first seasons, AND a color-coordinated sword to accompany it. You get multiple spare swords in the set as well. Never a bad thing to get a lot of&nbsp;weapons!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Recap:</b>&nbsp;A very cool looking Gundam/Transformer/Voltron inspired build-&nbsp;I dig it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ratings:</strong> Figures- 7/10, Main Build- 9/10, Side Builds 10/10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S. - Stickers aren&#39;t TOO bad, but there are a considerable amount. There are 21 stickers total, with many duplicates for each limb.</p>
