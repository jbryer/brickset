<p>Following the reveal of the new CORE subtheme for Ninjago, I wasn&#39;t very impressed with the smaller sets. However, the larger sets (specifically the combo mech, dragon, and temple) lured me to be interested in them. This was certainly the one I most desired as a huge dragon fan. I must say it certainly lived up to my expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build here was quite entertaining. I found the designers used a lot of unique pieces and there were no huge challenges within the build.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>This dragon follows a similar pattern with more recent dragons using non-brick-built wings. These wings are easily some of the most notable parts of the dragon, and they look absolutely stunning. The wing flapping feature works well, but I wish that the mechanism wasn&#39;t as stiff. The entire dragon features a blend of green and blue hues. This is unique for Lloyd, but I am personally a fan of this color scheme. The head is incredibly well-built, displaying intricate scales and patterns. It uses a combination of brick-built and molded elements, reminiscent of the Green Ninja Mech dragon from 2017 (this is my personal favorite style of dragon heads).</p>

<p>The articulation is rather minimal, with no knee joints on any of the legs. This is passable, however, seeing as this is a large dragon. Speaking of the dragon&#39;s size, it appears to be one of the few dragons to have a &quot;bulky&quot; appearance. That certainly separates this dragon from the other existing ones.</p>

<p>The saddle is well-designed and features room for TWO minifigures, something I have wanted for a long time. It&#39;s also a&nbsp;removable element, which is always welcome.</p>

<p>The turret that comes with the snakes is just fine. Its range is very limited, but it works as a side build.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I rather like the new ninja suits. Lloyd features a mix of different shades of green, and I think they complement each other very well. My thoughts on this figure may change in the future.</p>

<p>Nya doesn&#39;t look all that interesting, but I guess she&#39;s a passable minifigure.</p>

<p>Now for the two snakes whose names I&#39;m not going to bother to learn. They aren&#39;t remarkable by any means, however, I am surprised at the printing and design quality of these figures. The figures look excellent and are welcome inclusions.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison To Other Dragons</strong></p>

<p>I will mainly be comparing this to the Green NRG Dragon, Firstbourne (FB), and the Green Ninja Mech Dragon (GNM), all of which I own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is certainly a large improvement over the NRG dragon. This has a much more unique shape. The wings on both are excellent, but I feel as though the ones on the Legendary Dragon look much better with the entire dragon than those on the NRG. As a whole, it looks more complete and natural.</p>

<p>This dragon strongly reminds me of FB, mainly the wings and head. This dragon is much more stable than FB and also looks much more complete around the torso section. That may however be because I am judging FB in comparison to a male dragon&nbsp;when she is, in fact, a female.</p>

<p>The GNM was obviously made to look more mechanical, which is why it looks so much more different from this one. Legendary is much bulkier and uses more &quot;natural-looking&quot; elements. I personally prefer Legendary over the GNM, but I feel as though GNM largely inspired Legendary in terms of its head. The combination of a molded piece and some system elements is very derivative of the GNM.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>747 pieces are fitting for a set of $70. The dragon feels a bit more like $80 due to the large volume of pieces that there are, which is great. There is a high play value and an even higher display value.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Wonderful display piece</li>
	<li>Colorful new parts</li>
	<li>Strong play value&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Unique shape&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Good price</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mostly uninteresting (but good)&nbsp;figures</li>
	<li>Insignificant villain build</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This dragon certainly rivals other dragons of its size. I don&#39;t doubt that we will look back at this dragon as one of the best in Ninjago&#39;s history. I strongly recommend this to ANY dragon fans. I am almost certain that you will find yourself pleased.</p>
