"DoonsterBuildsLego","2022-01-27T17:11:33.823Z","A great looking temple building with loads of features","<p>I bought this set to stand as a Chinese temple to add to my display of Lunar New Year sets, but this set offers so much more than just a great looking, solidly built, temple building. It&#39;s the first Ninjago set I&#39;ve built.</p>

<p>The construction starts with the 2 smaller vehicles: a strange looking enemy ram raider and a very nice mech that utilises the new angled joint piece <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=79846"" target=""_blank"">79846</a>. At this point, with a couple of vehicles and minifigures, there is already what would be a nice little playlet by itself.</p>

<p>Building continues with the temple, working from the ground up, in layers. The many minifigures are interspersed throughout the build process. The entire construction is very solid throughout; no weak spots and it is easy to handle to turn around as the various details are added to the front and back. This, I feel, is one of the advantages of a lower age rating: a much less fragile building.</p>

<p>Throughout there are some nice parts used, and plenty of spares, especially katana swords in many colours. The colour scheme with reddish brown walls with dark green roof and black supports works well, although I did change out the (unique) reddish brown <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=32932"" target=""_blank"">32932</a> fence pieces for their red equivalents as I think that looks better.</p>

<p>There is a mix of printed parts and a relatively small sticker sheet for the various decorations.</p>

<p>This set has a lot of playability, as we might expect from one of the main sets from this wave. Throughout the temple are various rooms including training rooms, a shrine, the meditation area across the bridge, mech control station and a breakable wall. I think there are plenty of scenarios that could be created with the range of figures, both hero and villain.</p>

<p>And yet, even without that, the main temple serves as a very nice display piece, too, being the main reason I bought it.</p>

<p>Even for the parts count, this is pretty good value. With the range of figures (only Zane &amp; Jay are missing from the main team), a couple of nice vehicles and good use of the parts throughout, I think it represents excellent value for money and is worthwhile whether being bought for kids just getting into Ninjago (or ninjas in general) or as a nice display piece.</p>

<p>Mini figs-AWESOME!!!! I love the new colour contrasts on the ninja robes and the Wu and P.i.x.a.l are great!</p>

<p>Set-&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great temple build. Having it in person it has so much room and is very nice looking,albeit i do not like the side build for the villian. The CORE ninjago wave has been great,apart from the small dragons of both which i have reviewed. Just buy this and the LLD (Lloyds legendary dragon) And you are set for this wave!</p>

<p>Price per part is also awesome! PICK IT UP!</p>

<p>Now for a quick break from the Crystalized reviews. I got this set for my birthday, and I was over the moon for it. I&#39;ve always wanted a home base for the ninja, as I skipped out on the previous monasteries. I can surely say that I have no regrets. This set does not disappoint but&nbsp;<em>exceeds</em>&nbsp;my expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The building experience here is a lot of fun. I really feel myself building this thing from the ground up. All the parts here are so satisfying to put together, and I was never bored. On a quick note, I skipped bags 1 and 2 since those are not part of the temple, and I ended up building those later.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>I am so excited to be reviewing this amazing piece of construction. Everything here is just immaculate. This is Ninjago returning to its roots (or should I say its CORE). The colour scheme is striking, yet so simple. The giant red doors add that perfect splash of colour and make this feel somewhat like a fortress. I love the minute details of the security camera and the small mezzanine. The slight cracks in the rocks and the traditional lanterns mixed with the wood-carved walls just fill me with joy.</p>

<p>Moving inside, this set packs so much in and has so much space to pose minifigures and have incredible fights. There are obviously some amenities like a tearoom, Samurai X cave, and dojo. As I said, there is lots of space on every level to pose the Ninja team doing their daily tasks.</p>

<p>The play features here are also ingenious. The small battle ram included can break down a wall inside the Samurai X cave, which works well (it actually requires some force which is fun) and looks natural.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another play feature is on this small plot of land to the side. While it is minuscule, there are a lot of neat details packed into this tiny space. The play feature mentioned includes Nya shooting her water bolts at small flames, which is cute and fun.</p>

<p>The two side-builds also add a lot of value to this set. The small battering ram is quite entertaining and works with one of the main play features of this set. The Kai EVO mech doesn&#39;t look all that good, but it is highly poseable and sturdy.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures in this set are mostly bland. PIXAL is a standout, finally giving us an easy way to get her head and hair without having to fork over a lot of money to get the 2014 minifigure. Wu is exclusive, but his suit is nothing special.</p>

<p>The CORE suits for the Ninja are likely some of the worst suits in Ninjago&#39;s history. Something about the designs is just so off-putting. Lloyd looks messy, Nya and Kai are bland, but Cole looks alright.</p>

<p>The vipers included have some excellent designs, but they&#39;re nothing special.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For the first time in quite a while, I feel as though the value for this set is alright. There is more play value here than sets that exceed its price. So much space and interactive play is available. The temple is also highly displayable and has quite a presence.&nbsp;This isn&#39;t quite as big as some other $100 sets from past years, but it is an amazing value for today&#39;s standards.</p>

<p><strong>Pros.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Amazing play value</li>
	<li>Good value</li>
	<li>Beautiful display piece</li>
	<li>Easy way to get PIXAL</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Bridge is fragile</li>
	<li>Mostly weak and common minifigures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This has to be one of my favourite Ninjago sets of all time. Every single aspect is here, and I would highly recommend this to anyone, whether you are a big-time Ninjago fan or just someone trying to find a good LEGO theme. The minifigures may not be amazing for fans who already have these characters, but I can still strongly recommend it for people of all ages.</p>
