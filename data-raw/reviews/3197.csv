Unlike the 6921, it contains a switch set and ramps,&nbsp;and more track. No figs, not much play value, but value when you have a monorail! To bad there is not a layout to expand the Airport Shuttle.",FALSE,5,5,3,2,3
"DunksterBricks","2016-03-05T12:43:46.257Z","The Best Accessory Set for Monorail!","<p>To&nbsp;correct the previous review, this set does not contain slopes. &nbsp;The image posted here reflects what can be built when this set, 6347 is combined with the Airport Shuttle set 6399.</p>

<p>Set 6347 contains: 2x switches,&nbsp;4x large&nbsp;curves, 2x&nbsp;small curves, 4x very short straights, 2x long straights and the 1x4 plates to connect the pieces of tracks together. &nbsp;There are also 10 of the larger support pillars included.</p>

<p>Below is a video showing the un-boxing of this set.</p>
