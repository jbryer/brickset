<br />
Although I have never seen any X-Men movies, I have certainly heard people praise the franchise. I have not owned any X-Men sets, and I have little interest in watching the films.<br />
<br />
But a small X-Men set with a nice minifigure was hard to pass up, especially if I was to start getting into X-Men.<br />
<br />
It seems surprising to me that there would suddenly be a new X-Men set out of the blue, particularly because I don&#39;t think there are any new instalments coming out soon? Hopefully this means more X-Men sets to come.<br />
<br />
This set was originally scheduled to be released on 1st January&nbsp;2022, but was pushed back to 1st April instead, with LEGO citing &quot;stability issues&quot;.<br />
<br />
<em>Is this set worth the $17.99 AUD that I paid?</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The box is the smaller style of Marvel mech sets, Decorated with&nbsp;the new Marvel borders with black-and-white comic-esque squares depicting Marvel superheroes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Streaks of primary colours form the background&nbsp;(yellow, red and blue), which is true to Wolverine&#39;s colour scheme, and vaguely reminds me of the Bifrost. Wolverine&#39;s mech has an appealing action pose, claws slicing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and build process</strong><br />
<br />
Three&nbsp;unnumbered bags contain all the pieces. Thankfully, there are no stickers, and all the decorated pieces are printed!<br />
<br />
It took me about 20 minutes to build the entire set at a leisurely pace. It was an enjoyable experience and I did learn some new building techniques which I&nbsp;plan on using for my&nbsp;MOCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Wolverine</strong> is one of the most&nbsp;famous members of the X-Men, and I say this knowing almost&nbsp;nothing about the&nbsp;X-Men.<br />
<br />
I thought his helmet component was new, but after doing some research, this piece is not new, and has been brought back for 2022, from the 2014 set&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76022-1/X-Men-vs-The-Sentinel"">76022 X Men vs The Sentine</a>l. It is a yellow helmet with wing-like designs on the sides, painted black. The entire piece gives off a distinct Batman feel.<br />
<br />
His head is a new piece though, and there are alternate expressions! One features a pair of opaque goggles over Wolverine&#39;s face, which of course features his iconic sideburns, along with gritted teeth. His reverse face has the same sideburns, but without the goggles so his eyes are shown. He also has a sly smile, and if I didn&#39;t know any better I would&#39;ve thought it looked sinister! The dual expressions fit Wolverine though.<br />
<br />
While the flame yellowish legs are unprinted, the torso piece has a new design which definitely resemble different parts of previous designs, and I like this simple jumpsuit aesthetic which shows off his abs!<br />
<br />
Wolverine comes equipped with the same basic tri-pronged&nbsp;claws that all of his minifigure variants share.<br />
<br />
<strong>Model</strong><br />
<br />
Wolverine&#39;s mech follows the basic&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Character-Mech"">LEGO Marvel mech formula established in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>The most defining feature&nbsp;of Wolverine as a&nbsp;character, and therefore this mech, are the giant claws, and LEGO has not disappointed here in my opinion. 6 large silver blade pieces form three claws on each hand, and they look great, clearly distinguishing this mech from others!</p>

<p>While I do appreciate&nbsp;the giant claws, there is a minor issue that I personally&nbsp;cannot overlook. The fingers underneath the claws don&#39;t match up with the actual positions of the claws, so they end up looking weirdly squished together under the claws. It&#39;s not a huge issue, but I don&#39;t like it. I can&#39;t exactly think of a better solution, so this will have to do.<br />
<br />
The X-Men symbol on the yellow cockpit is printed on a 2x2 round tile, and looks sufficiently generic for uses elsewhere. I also like the red belt design, which has a printed 1x2 tile and looks great. The back is plain but has a nice basic colour scheme.<br />
<br />
The hip design is slightly controversial and is most likely the reason of the delayed release, since it is the only part of the base design that has been changed. The original design had the legs attached to a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6359227/beam-1-module-w-3-balls-dia-5-9"">Technic piece with Mixels ball joints</a>, and I haven&#39;t seen any&nbsp;problems with that design.&nbsp;In fact, I would argue that the original design allowed a superior range of motion, therefore allowing for more dynamic poses.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The new solution seems to me to be very hastily resolved, by using a System brick-built design and stacking two <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6123814/plate-1x2-w-5-9-ball-end"">plates with Mixels ball joints</a>, causing the two legs to be slightly offset, with one leg being stacked forward from&nbsp;the other. This is barely noticeable, but articulation is less than the original design, as I mentioned.&nbsp;In most poses it won&#39;t be noticeable, but the problem still exists and I look forward to a new solution if LEGO continues to produce Marvel mech sets.<br />
<br />
The feet are nice and flat, and they look strong.<br />
<br />
Wolverine&#39;s minifigure&nbsp;fits comfortably&nbsp;in the mech, without the need to detach his accessories, which is great since there is no other spot for attaching his claws.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
Being a set with a single hero, there is not much actual playability. However, I can imagine 7-year-olds having fun playing with the various features this set offers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>While pricing in other countries seem like a steal for this set, $17.99 seems a little too&nbsp;steep to me. Regardless, I had an enjoyable experience with this set, and the Wolverine minifigure is an appealing addition to the modern LEGO Marvel line.<br />
<br />
I would not buy any other similar sets again for $17.99 though, and I would rather wait for a discount.<br />
<br />
I would recommend this set to&nbsp;any LEGO&nbsp;Marvel collectors and/or X-Men fans.<br />
<br />
I hope you found this review helpful and informative.</p>

"ShadowWolfHount","2023-02-07T00:26:40.53Z","Small return of X-Men","<p>It has been sense <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76022-1/X-Men-vs-The-Sentinel"">2014</a> that we got an X-men set (if you don&#39;t count the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76073-1/Mighty-Micros-Wolverine-vs-Magneto"">mighty micro</a>) and it made another small return in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Character-Mech"">mech line of marvel sets</a>.</p>

<p>This is also my first time getting one of these mechs as the previous ones didn&#39;t have anything instating to get them, epically as they have minifigures we have got many times before, though good as they&#39;re in the $10 price.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>However, for this mech was a minifigure we rarely get but&nbsp;pretty much in all the X-men sets.</p>

<p>Wolverine in a new version of his iconic outfit, and instatingly reuse his mask from the 2014 set, don&#39;t fix what isn&#39;t broken. Bite sad that he doesn&#39;t come with a hairpiece, then again that one hasn&#39;t been used sense the Mighty Micro and I think they made a good choice picking the mask over the hair but hope it&#39;ll return someday.</p>

<h3>Mech</h3>

<p>As stated, this is my first marvel mech line set, and it was a very nice simple build along with expectedly standing up well with claws befitting of the character.</p>

<p>Able to get him into some cool posses. Though the&nbsp;lower body leg connection is strange of using two <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6123814/plate-1x2-w-5-9-ball-end"">1x2 mixed plate</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bothersome of not having an even amount of poseability for the legs.</p>

<p>It brings in some good part to use for MOCs if you in need of some Bright Light Orange and Dark Blue. Along with having two different X-men prints, could be used as part of the frame of a display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly if your like me and have bought many <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Mixels"">Mixel</a> sets before, well be ready to see the same gay and dark gay mixed joints again because they&#39;re in all the mechs.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I do certainly recommend getting this if you&#39;re a fan of X-men as they&#39;re rare sets to see. Though I am a little bit sadden that it&#39;s another Wolverine, I do hope future mechs would give us new X-men characters.</p>

<p>Outside of fan of it, I still do recommend it as it&#39;s a nice small set.</p>
