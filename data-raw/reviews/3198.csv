"Kid_Paddle","2006-08-03T07:44:58Z","Cool bricks","I love this police set! With some simple bricks they created something very cool-looking. There is the motorcycle that is actually very simple but looks really professional, and there are some nice futures like a whole computerroom in the truck, with some special bricks like a band recorder, a computer and a tile with police photographes.

But, why are the emergency lights on the cab red and blue when elsewhere they had been two blues [including in this set]? I remember being very upset at the time that the officer did not have a proper hat, too. I would have probably preferred a police van to be a riot squad type one.

The detail on this set is great, everything was thought out and neat, except...

I never liked the way that the back door on the trailer shut. It was neat when open, yet when closed looked a bit of a mess.

Other than that I love this set. It was one of the first that I got that had minifigs with different expressions (other than the pirates).

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-04T07:27:25.37Z","LEGO Town (Police) - Surveillance Squad Review","This is a cool set to have and a great addition to any LEGO city for sure. The build is very fun and we also get a few stickers to put on. The truck and the motorcycle are very fun to play with and very easy to maneuver as well. The trailer of the truck can be removed very easily and the ceiling can be opened very easily, too. The walls of the trailer on the side and on the back can be opened as well and in the inside you can see a little office with some computers, a reward and two chairs which sviwel full 360°. We also get a few barriers and on the top of the trailer you can find a radar which sviwels full 360° as well. There's also a nice flood light which also sviwels full 360°.

"James83","2013-01-04T11:00:59.927Z","Riot Control #2","<p>This set was a modern interpretation of the old Set 6676 Mobile Command Unit. This set though was much bigger and offered far more options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The truck unit is based on that of Set 6346 Shuttle Launching Crew and Set 6670 Rescue Rig. It is similar in all respects but has blue lights in the front, blue and red lightbar on the roof, twin radio antennas and yellow lights on the roof. It looks good and the chassis has a neat attachment with the trailer and it works well and is reletively stable, even when turning. This set features more modern Police badging as well.</p><p>The trailer is the star of the set. It is large with four wheels and two outriggers at the front to support it on the ground when detached from the truck. The front is nicely streamlined and has room to stow two cones and a barrier. The roof features a movable six-light lighting unit, four smaller round lights and a swivelling satelite antenna dish at the back which folds down for storage when moving. The rear of trailer roof slopes to meet the swiveling blocks and looks good. The sturdy&nbsp;roof opens to reveal the working area which has four large window panels. The working area features two swiveling seats and two computer terminals. The forward one features an inverted computer brick, a tape brick and a printed radar brick with a printed 'wanted person' brick which was then new. This is angled by a hinge brick. The rear computer is a printed screen brick and a keyboard brick and the unit hinges to allow access to the rear door and ladder. The rear area also features hooks for a radio and a traffic baton. The rear door has a window in it and it opens upwards. The stowage of the ladder and door isn't neat when on the move. The rear of the trailer has two blue lights at the top, two red at the bottom and a lightbar with two indicators and two brake lights with a Police brick. </p><p>A bonus is a motorcycle with new Police signs, blue blue light and radio antenna.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Three Policemen come with this set and all are new-style Policemen. The driver has black legs, black jacket with badge, blue shades and stuble head&nbsp;and a red Police cap. The officer in the trailer has a new-style Police uniform, moustached head&nbsp;and hair, rather than a Police hat. The motorcycle officer has a new-style zipped jacket and new helmet with Police logo. He has a sunglasses head. Don't mess with&nbsp;coppers with bikes and shades!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>This is a big vehicle set and works better than the Shuttle transporter. Quite why the Lego Police needs such a huge mobile HQ isn't clear but its more capable than the older 1980s 6676 set (although much bigger and less handy around town). However, I took the cool map sticker and its wall unit brick from the 6676&nbsp;and replaced one of the window units of the trailer (a perfect fit) to add a map to this well-equipped control centre and a couple of other computer bricks. It's no chase vehicle but if your planning a stake-out operation then its a good addition. The neat touches like the floodlights are nice and the well-designed truck and trailer look good when travelling and its stable, even when cornering. A good set if you think it fits with your Police force.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
"carlosfsm","2014-05-04T02:21:01.09Z","One of the best Police sets ever.","<p>I played with this set so many times. I liked it very much because it had great detail. This was my first set that had computers and swivel seats. The trailer had lots of movable parts and the truck had lots of nice touches and detail.</p>

<p>I remember that I liked to have the trailer wrecked by some other vehicle driving pass through it while the operators inside jumped out of it.</p>

<p>A great set to have.</p>

"peti7788","2022-12-24T22:37:48.207Z","First big rig police semi truck and my first police set","<p>This was my first police set I received from my parents on Christmas 1994 or 1995.&nbsp;My younger brother helped put it together, but because his nails were small, he couldn&rsquo;t separate the plates, so the bricks were full of tooth marks.&nbsp;Of course, I have already replaced chewed parts.</p>

<p>We played a lot with this set because the police big rig truck was a novelty, there was no such vehicle before.&nbsp;It had at least as many game functions as a police station.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>All parts are easy to obtain, not special except for two pieces: the 1x4x3 window-shaped panel and the old small hinges.I think there is only one set of 1x4x3 panel pieces in this set that also has a window on it.&nbsp;If this is true, then this panel piece is quite rare. That means it can be expensive.&nbsp;This is the era for Lego when special parts were overused, from which individual pieces were developed for each set. This increased the cost of production. Which led directly to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6554-1/Blaze-Brigade"" target=""_blank"">malaise era</a> (1997-2003).</p>

<p>Fortunately, almost every brick or tile with graphics is printed. Except for two black 1x4x3 panels with police insignia. I don&#39;t understand why they couldn&#39;t print these already.&nbsp;By the way,&nbsp;even the famously dangerous &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8YlJ_VgZSo"" target=""_blank"">Crazy Charlie</a>&quot;&nbsp;face is also on the mugshot on the gray printed tile next to the radar monitor.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>The set includes 3 minifigures, a biker cop, a detective and a police chief. At that time, police sets did not include bad guys and criminals, they were only for police stations so that the jail cell would not be empty. Back then, the crime rate in Lego Town&nbsp;was even lower.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52583909686_1881fa4b75_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" /></p>

<p>The police chief&#39;s face appeared in quite a few sets.&nbsp; But the detective&#39;s face was also a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ItYmtPflac"" target=""_blank"">car thief</a> before.</p>

<h3>Truck</h3>

<p>The vehicle looks great! Especially with that grille&nbsp;at the front. The look of the cab section&nbsp;looked aggressive because of the grille. Although this design solution became quite <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6346-1/Shuttle-Launching-Crew"" target=""_blank"">trite in the 1990s</a>, Lego released <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6539-1/Victory-Cup-Racers"" target=""_blank"">too many trucks</a> with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6670-1/Rescue-Rig"" target=""_blank"">same front</a>. I also like that the wheel tracks are not the same width. The sleeping cabin is also a good idea, but I don&#39;t like the fact that it is walled with 2x3 white bricks. This can be easily fixed, I replaced it with 1x3 bricks and there is already more space here.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52584422978_0d44b76ffb_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" /></p>

<p>At that time, other sets put a 2x3 container here, like the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6335-1/Indy-Transport"" target=""_blank"">Indy Transport</a>. Interestingly, the chimney must be built from minifigure glasses.</p>

<h3>Trailer</h3>

<p>Finally 6 studs wide! The trailer is full of 1990s computers and surveillance equipment, like the FBI truck in the movie The Rock. Even a tape recorder! The undercarriage was solved so that one of the wheels does not hang in the air if the trailer is not horizontal. There is an unnecessarily complex support made of rare and expensive hinge elements. There is a traffic cone and a barricade at the front of the trailer. On the roof is a retractable satellite antenna and a hinge from also rare train sets that holds the reflector lamp.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52583440992_e6c16209ce_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the use of space inside is not very good, but if we put the dispatcher part forward with the radar and the swivel chairs, there will be enough space in the back to fit the police motorcycle.&nbsp;If you&nbsp;remove the white tile from the top of the 1x2 gray hinge, then the second chair can also be completely turned around, because it gets stuck in the tile anyway.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52583436042_7c7e9eb372_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" /></p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I am absolutely satisfied with the set, despite the fact that I was never that interested in the police theme. I would have been more happy with a fire station or a coast guard set, I was more interested in rescue sets. But hey! It&#39;s a Christmas gift, and it&#39;s free, with lots of game features and alternative builds on the back of the box. And it&#39;s even special because it&#39;s the first police big rig truck. A good memory from the 90s and childhood Christmas gift openings.</p>
