<p>Build experience: I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had building Gargantos, it uses some novel building techniques. It reminded me at times of building some of the more complex brick-heads. I like&nbsp;the look of the completed build, with Gargantos elevated on four of its tentacles.</p>

<p>Parts: A couple of parts that were new to me, including a useful new 2x1x1+2/3 SNOT brick, and a new 4x4 round transparent orange element.</p>
