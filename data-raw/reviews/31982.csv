<br />
From what I&#39;ve seen online, 76207 Attack on New Asgard was not very well received by many LEGO Marvel fans. Some key complaints included being seemingly non-canon, and that none of the minifigures included were&nbsp;exclusive to this set, all of them found in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76208-1/The-Goat-Boat"">76208 The Goat Boat</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I was not expecting much when I purchased this set. I had wanted this set only for the figures and maybe the pieces, since I will not be able to afford the Goat Boat - my wallet has plans for the 2022 2HY Star Wars wave...<br />
<br />
Having built the set though, my opinions have changed a bit.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The box has a nice <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Marvel-Super-Heroes/subtheme-Thor-Love-and-Thunder"">Thor: Love and Thunder</a>-themed border, shared with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76208-1/The-Goat-Boat"">76208 The Goat Boat</a>, and possibly future sets under the T:L&amp;T subtheme!<br />
<br />
On the right of the box you see Thor and Mighty Thor, (played by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie&nbsp;Portman respectively) with their eyes glowing blue.<br />
<br />
Mighty Thor&#39;s hammer has noticeable cracks with blue lightning seeping through, and I wonder if Mighty Thor retrieved and repaired the pieces of the original Mjolnir (which was broken by Hela upon her introduction in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor:_Ragnarok"">Thor: Ragnarok</a>).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the back right, the set is showcased at a different angle than the front, and the right side has a nice little contrast to the front with Thor and Mighty Thor&#39;s LEGO minifigures in their exact positions and stances as the front.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and build process</strong><br />
<br />
Inside the box are two bags numbered 1 &amp; 2 (number 1 being larger) that contain the 158 pieces, as well as an instruction manual with the box art and a QR code. Lastly, there is also a sticker sheet with 4 stickers, which are thankfully easily to apply.<br />
<br />
It took me roughly 20&nbsp;minutes to build&nbsp;everything at a leisurely pace.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
<br />
For many buyers, the minifigures will undoubtedly be the highlights, although none of them are exclusive to this set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mighty Thor</strong> are found in Bag 1, and <strong>Gorr</strong> can be found in Bag 2.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thor</strong> is a brand new minifigure.<br />
<br />
The head piece is in 6 other&nbsp;sets to date. This set is the 7th to include it, and is the second cheapest, only behind <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40525-1/Endgame-Battle"">40525 Endgame Battle</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The rest of the minifigure is new and excellent, with&nbsp;new torso and leg pieces&nbsp;that definitely resembles that of <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh764/ikaris"">Ikaris</a>&nbsp;(whose torso people used to make custom Thor minifigures).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The build of Stormbreaker in this set is new, I believe. I can see some obvious improvements but the brown &quot;branch&quot; part should be longer. Also, the colour of the light bluish gray tile with clip doesn&#39;t really match up with the rest of the axe blade or the counterweight.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mighty Thor&nbsp;</strong>is also a brand new minifigure.<br />
<br />
She reuses a head piece originally designed for Jyn Erso in 2016, which&nbsp;has since appeared in 19 sets as a generic minifigure head for licensed themes,&nbsp;and is not particularly hard to obtain currently.<br />
<br />
The rest of the minifigure is&nbsp;superb though. A new dual-molded hair-helmet combo element was designed for her, and it looks amazing. The torso and leg pieces are fully printed on both sides.<br />
<br />
She wields Mjolnir, which at this point is a fairly common piece. Unfortunately, it isn&#39;t printed, which is a shame since it would&#39;ve captured more of the cracks and lightning details. The <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71018-10/Battle-Dwarf"">Battle Dwarf</a> minifigure from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Collectable-Minifigures/subtheme-Series-17"">Collectable Minifigures Series 17</a> has shown that printing on the Mjolnir piece is possible, too.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, both Thor and Mighty Thor have red capes which only have one neck hole, more commonly known as the &quot;4+ cape&quot;. Also, both of them even have feet printing :)<br />
<br />
The last minifigure is <strong>Gorr</strong>.<br />
<br />
He is also decent, with a brand new head and torso that look mummified. His plain white legs are unprinted but they server their purpose well enough, despite being a little bland.<br />
<br />
He wields a black sword.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Build</strong><br />
<br />
The only model in this set is the &quot;Shadow Monster&quot;. I don&#39;t think it appears in any of the promotion materials or trailers for Thor: Love and Thunder. Nevertheless, the pieces could prove useful.<br />
<br />
There is reasonable articulation throughout the model, and I personally like&nbsp;the bulky base. The entire model is heavier than it looks, with a good amount of pieces forming the base. The two black 1x1&nbsp;tiles are printed to represent the creature&#39;s eyes, and I can&nbsp;see those pieces being used by MOC builders.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s definitely not the best model ever, but I think it looks good among my collection.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m going to wait until I see the Thor: Love and Thunder movie in July, to decide what I&#39;m going to do with this model. If it appears in the movie, I&#39;ll keep it built for a while until the Thor hype dies down a bit.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If it doesn&#39;t appear, I&#39;ll be disassembling the model after I get home from the cinema so I can use the pieces in MOCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall</strong><br />
<br />
I&#39;m not going to be spending my money on the Goat Boat, in an effort to save up&nbsp;for more Star Wars. However, I did want the minifigures, and the pieces were decent enough too, so I made this&nbsp;purchase.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you are a LEGO Marvel fan&nbsp;and have the budget for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76208-1/The-Goat-Boat"">76208 The Goat Boat</a>, then you won&#39;t need this set for anything.<br />
<br />
For casual fans like me, this set is a great little taste of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Marvel-Super-Heroes/subtheme-Thor-Love-and-Thunder"">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> theme.<br />
<br />
I hope you found this review helpful and informative!</p>
