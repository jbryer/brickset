"MDC427","2022-05-04T00:52:22.427Z","Great display set with no stickers","<p>This is a great set. I don&#39;t give it 5/5 for one reason: the X-wing. I don&#39;t understand why Lego made it so the X-wing is mounted at an angle. I think it should be level. I figured out how to make it so. One of the pieces&nbsp;used to mount Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter is a trans-clear brick, round 1 x 1 open stud (shaped like a cylinder). The X-wing can be mounted level with the piece, so I ordered a few from Brick Link.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no stickers, which is great (but rare) for a Lego set. Since this is a display/art set&nbsp;there&#39;s no playability, which is fine for me as I will put this&nbsp;in a display case on a book shelf. I also love the detail of the Death Star. They also chose a great quote for the set (&quot;The Force is strong with this one.&quot; - Darth Vader). Overall, I rate this 4/5.</p>

"legoDad42","2022-07-23T09:46:39.457Z","The greebling is strong with this one!","<p>Fabulous detailed diorama of the famed <strong>Death Star Trench Run</strong>.<br />
There&#39;s been two other Lego official kits, a junior 4+ 75235 X-wing Starfighter Trench Run, which is more of a small but very nice kids playset and a freebie gift with purchase 20th Anniversary 40407 Death Star II Battle (more of a surface battle than a trench run), which seems to scale to this particular kit we&#39;re reviewing.<br />
<br />
<strong>PRO&#39;s...</strong><br />
- Incredible amount of detail. The greebling is second to only the UCS Millenium Falcon&#39;s exterior.</p>

<p>- Terrific looking display.</p>

<p>- Printed exclusive tiles.</p>

<p>- Very exclusive 1x1 printed R2-D2 round tile.</p>

<p>- 4 mini-vehicles (Luke&#39;s X-Wing, 2 TIE Fighters and Darth Vader&#39;s TIE Advanced).</p>

<p>- Nice new style build for Luke&#39;s mini X-Wing.</p>

<p>- Pearl silver grill elements.</p>

<p>- An XX-9 heavy turbolaser tower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Look and feel of a well made MOC.</p>

<p><strong>CON&#39;s...</strong></p>

<p>- No minifigures (for the price perhaps a Luke in X-Wing uniform and Darth Vader or a TIE Fighter Pilot with Luke?)*.</p>

<p>- TIE fighters very blocky. Look also out of scale a bit to the X-Wing (but I believe they did this on purpose to push a forced perspective).</p>

<p>- No build option guide to add on another &#39;Trench Run&#39; to extend the display like they had for the 21014 Great Wall of China.</p>

<p>- Just slightly expensive given no minifigures*.<br />

<p><em>Refreshing new mini X-Wing build. Although the engines aren&#39;t in the right spot, it&#39;s a nice new change of pace with the ruby gem elements, also the dark red accents and ski poles really look great at this scale. And of course, the exclusive R2 tile is perfect...</em></p>
