The interior is pretty good and the front yard looks pretty good too. An impressive set that should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-08T02:35:32.95Z","Lovely.","This is one of those 'ideal home' sets.  Well-designed, its interior contains a kitchen, sitting room and a bedroom upstairs.  Outside there's a garage for the car and a garden  There's plenty of detail such as the fence, dustbin, flowers and post-box, and I love the baseplate with its crazy-paved driveway (I think this baseplate was used in only two sets).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2022-01-23T10:56:02.093Z","More Playability Than You think","<p><strong>6349</strong> was one of the first sets I got, when I was a kid. Now when I ask my parents about their choice, they said, that this house seemed to be &quot;a lot of fun, joy and it was simply a lovely villa&quot;. I completely agree with them about it.<br />
<br />
Here we have a nice house with red roof, that is probably owned by a lady in beads. She has a cool kitchen with a telephone, a dining room with large windows, her own car and a garden. There is also a gardener, that looks after her flowers. The second floor with these now really rare windows includes her bedroom. Btw the house has two doors: the Main Entrance, and the one at the garage.<br />
<br />
There are many details in this set, apart from what I&#39;ve already mentioned. A shovel, a garbage tin, a postbox, white fences and many other things.<br />
<br />
Through the years this set proved its high playability, as I used the green plate for various creations of my own, together with all the variety of bricks presented in this wonderful set.</p>

"Nesquik","2012-08-25T05:48:16.64Z","Happy Holidays!","Just wonderful. I was an 80's/90's child of Legoland and Lego System, so I bought this only recently as, back in the day, it was one of those sets that I wished I had owned, only to find that it soon disappeared in stores.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>When you purchase vintage Lego products, it's always important to take it all in as something of its time, and not to get carried away by judging it against the standards of current products. But there are certain exceptions... The baseplate alone is a glorious reminder of when sets offered more of a palette for creativity (and when they were cheaper to include in products), the micro-sized car base and wheels are particularly sweet (although not as nice to grip as modern car moulds), and the minifigures look very casual.</div><div><br></div><div>Even the choice of colours in this product reflects the mindset of the Lego company at this point in time, as they tended to go for fewer-but-bolder hues. In doing this, the main colours used tend to repel each other, so the reds, whites and yellows offer a bright and purposeful look to the construction, which is important to children especially.</div><div><br></div><div>At 205 pieces it's quite a small brick count for a building, but I think this only enhances the actual playability. See, as much as it's great to have more detail through more (or specialised) components, what Lego have achieved with this set is efficiency, as they have developed a structure, functionality and playability all with the fewest amount of bricks necessary. To me, that helps the house to gain a more effortless look, and what which reminds me of my own youth with 'Basic' products. That of course is just sentimentality on my part.</div><div><br></div><div>I certainly wouldn't think twice about purchasing more Holiday Villas. The construction is that straightforward that you could reuse the instructions and replace the white components with another of your choice, and make a small street of different coloured villas. Unfortunately, the white components will fade with age, but that's not unique to this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a timeless product that would have no trouble appealing to children today just as it did in 1988. Now I'm off to find some bright white bricks!</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"iplante","2014-11-16T04:50:24.2Z","So many memories!","<p>This summer, having recently come out of my &quot;dark ages,&quot; I pulled out my old box of Lego at my parents&#39; house and went through, trying to build whatever old set I could remember having. The Holiday Villa was one of them. I got this set when I was approximately five years old, and I have many fond memories of it - the best probably being building it for the first time with my dad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was happy to see that I still had about 95% of the parts for it. I will order the missing parts ASAP so that I can pass on the finished model to my nieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Sadly, I no longer have the box or the original instructions. However, I found the instructions online and they are pretty easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of pretty cool pieces in this set. The ice box, cook&nbsp;top&nbsp;flat piece, telephone slope, and the various funky windows are all pretty awesome. I also like the printed umbrella piece. Otherwise, the white bricks used for the build of the house are pretty common. I also remember thinking that the base plate with the drive way was very cool when I was a kid.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Holiday Villa comes with two minifigs - one female wearing blue pants and a red necklace, and a guy in overalls carrying a shovel. I always thought the hair was pretty scary, but I remember being very happy to have a female minifig when I was a kid as those weren&#39;t that common back then.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty basic, but fun.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think that this house is awesome. It has two levels - the main floor holds the kitchen with a stove and an ice box, along with a table that seems more like an office desk. There is a small second level holding a bed. There is also a little carport with a car.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Lots of playability, fun model to build, good figs, and a cool looking house make this a great set! I&#39;m glad that I was able to build it again!</p>
