<p>1. It is Batman.&nbsp;No one can beat this!<br />
2. It lights up in the dark.<br />
3. It contains over 283 more LEGO pieces for the same price.</p>

<p>Other than that both sets are quite similar: both come in black, both are based on a Dodge, have the same price, are based on a movie which makes them&nbsp;licensed sets, are about the same size and&nbsp;require the same building time and technical skill.</p>

<p>I think the designer did a great job to capture the original design from the movie. It is a great set for kids to play with and&nbsp;I guess it will fit a Batman action figure perfectly. The Batmobile is&nbsp;a good entry into the world of LEGO Technic not only for fans of the Dark Crusader.</p>

"Zoul","2022-04-12T10:26:42.007Z","My current favorite set! Well worth the retail!","<p>This set is an amazing one especially for the retail price point at 100 USD! Super complex build that took around 13-14 hours to build. 11 of those hours was in one sitting because of how much fun it was! I felt like I was actually building a real (but small) car due to the amazing work the Technics team put into it! The only bad thing I would say is there are a lot of similar parts, but I don&#39;t recall the building process feeling too repetitive. A must-have for Batman fans looking for&nbsp;a decorative piece for their home!!</p>

<p>Lots of fun to build over a couple of days. Some repetitive builds but I never got bored. A lot of fun to watch it all come together, and I can&#39;t resist &quot;parking&quot; it every so often. Lots to do and explore once built -- doors (naturally), the hood, two light features, &quot;working&quot; pistons, and an actual working differential gear to boot.</p>

<p>Kudos to the design team who put this together. They&#39;ve really captured the coolness and toughness of what I think is the best Batmobile ever.</p>
