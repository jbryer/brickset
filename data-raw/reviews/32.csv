"A_Brickset_user","2003-01-14T00:00:00Z","","Just received my ISD on Jan 10th. WOW! Took me about 16 hours to build. I only have 1 complaint, the instruction book is almost 1 inch thick and I have never seen more errors in an instruction book. It appears that no one had proof read it. By the time I had finished putting this beast together, the binding on the book had fallen apart. Other than that, this set is awesome.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-14T00:00:00Z","","Amazing set...the directions are a spiral-bound book for pete's sake!  This set, like all Ult. Coll. Series sets, is for display only.  SP-EDs wishing to ""play"" with something can go drool on their Duplex sets.  Just a couple cons: the mini blockade runner is a little cheesy and the HUGE drive exhaust ports aren't anchored on as firmly as I'd like.  Star Destroyers are actually white, but that would be glaringly obnoxious with a set this size.  If you have a choice between the Rebel Blockade Runner and the Star Destroyer, definately fork over the extra cash for this monster.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-09T00:00:00Z","","Now this is what LEGO is about. While it may not be minifig scale, and also ridiculously expensive... Lego has always been about having ""flagship"" designs that all the kids aspire to.  Then market the low-dollar sets to the kids while they dream away of these models. Lego definitely needs a few sets like this around to

If you think that it has no playability whatsoever, why review something like a USC model if you know that the large models can't be made to play around alot. And even if you don't like it, you can easily build your own creations out of the many pieces it offers. And Ryan, if you think that this is a large mound of cheap plastic, why even bother going on this site.

The build was nice and takes a long time to finish. I suggest you pace yourself as some of the sections can be really tedious. The details are good and the colors are OK (it's gray afterall!).

Love the little things in the details.  The only fault to the set has to be the magnets used to hold the bottom flaps together.  With the slightest manipulation these come apart.  Any lego addict can fix this, but the design should have been remedied before release.  Another curious thing if you look closely the date of copyright is 2001.  How long has Lego had this around without the release???  Can't wait to see what Master Series is next.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-29T02:19:02Z","Just plain AWESOME","This was the set that re-sparked my interest in Lego, a good 15 years after I stopped playing with it (not including when I found the original X-wing and Tie/Y-Wing sets on sale).  When I came across it on the 'net my reaction was &quot;That is just damn cool.&quot;  The price, of course was a bit of a sticking point, but in the end I said &quot;What the hell!&quot; and just ordered it.

It wasn't until I started putting it together that I got a sense of why it cost so much - the time and effort that went into designing the construction must have been immense (hats off to the designers).

It took me almost twelve hours to put together over two days and putting the wings together was a bit painful at times (double-counting the number of studs on grey pieces of plastic can get quite tiring), but it was all worth it.  It has pride of place in my lounge room (much to the wife's chagrin) and looks fantastic.

I don't think it's in production anymore, but they're still available from S@H as I write this.  Get it!  Get it now!  If you're a SW Lego fan you'll regret missing out on this one.  I missed the UCS X-Wing and TIE Interceptor and I'm not that fussed because I have the ISD.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-05T14:55:01Z","Phew! Seriously hard work!","A *huge* set that takes a lot of planning to build.  I was very glad to that I kept all the bricks in piles of the same type otherwise it would have taken even longer than the 10 hours I spent building it.

The only downside I found was I built it on the dining room table then had to move it to its final home - I had to remove the superstructure to be able to carry it safely but as other reviewers have said, this is a model not a you to be played with.

Was great fun to build - even my wife enjoyed helping out.  Some parts could be tedious for one builder (a couple of major parts of the construction have 20 steps then x2 at the end :-).  A few heartstopping moments placing the superstructure on top of the main ship but safe enough.

Wish it was stable enough to hang from a ceiling somewhere, but I think I'd some serious wire!  All things said and done, an excellent set that all my friends comment on when they see it.

- UCS X-wing
-UCS Tie Interceptor
- UCS Rebel Blockade Runner
-UCS Darth Maul Bust
- UCS Snowspeeder
-UCS N-1 starfighter

The only drawback is that after a few months the bricks start to 'bend' all over the model: it has turned out that my model has started to sink down its nose on ist stand... maybe because of the dust ?!?

I asked for it for my birthday this year and sat down and had some serious fun.

The poor thing can barely support its own weight, and I have cats, so its fragility is a problem.  I plan on leaving it put together, so to counteract the fragility, I am gluing it together with model cement.  I am doing this to all my UCS sets so my cats can't destroy them.

It's a long build, but fun when done in small sections. And the finished model is breathtaking. It didn't get a perfect ten because the pieces are all mixed together. LEGO should have organised it into several seperate sections to make the build easier. However, this is a small fault.

"A_Brickset_user","2007-02-13T18:00:19.273Z","Awesome Set","I purchased this set when it was first released a few years ago now and still remember that it took my brother and me 13 hours of non stop building to complete it. (yes we did dream of Lego that night lol) The build can get a little tedious at times but it’s rewarding none the less. There are however a few issues with this set, which is why I've rated it 4 instead of 5:
1). The instruction book does contain a few errors which if not spotted can cause headaches further into the build.
2). My instruction book also came apart, albeit only the first couple pages.
3). The whole set is too fragile, the superstructure buckles near the front of the ship once all the wings are on due to the weight and the rear exhaust ports are way too flimsy. In fact the whole ship overall is just too weak.

Last year I decided to completely dismantle the set &amp; I am now in the process of rebuilding it, using model glue on every piece in the hope that I end up with something a bit more solid, however each major piece will be left separate should I ever need to move it in the future. So all 4 wings, the two bridge sections and the stand can be removed from the superstructure.

Pros:
-Very fun to build the sections and put them together
-Very nice detailing
-Able to come apart in 3 main sections making it easy to move from room to room.
-When people see it, they're like, &quot;Wow!&quot;
-TONS of bricks, raw materials for later building.

Cons:
-It's too big, especially for my little house.
-I had this thing for 3 years now and I noticed the nose started to bend downward.
-Too much gray, making it a little tedious to build.
-Magnets aren't strong enough to hold bottom sections.
-I later had to attach long rubber bands around the ship to keep the sections in place and the nose back to normal. I also had to reinforced the stand which kept bending at an odd angle.

ISD was really my dream. I was completely in love with this set. But there was one big obstruction- this set was (and still is) unavailable to buy in our small country. Of course, finally I got it, but you can&#180;t imagine how hard it was. The construction lasted nearly 12 houres, but it was the best day in my life.
This set contains more than 3000 pieces and it consists of 3 parts- main body and 2 parts of a bridge. And the magnetic system have to be highlighted primarily. 
I have to disagree with some other reviews. If you buy LEGO, especially this set, and you don&#180;t like building, than you are very stupid (except of small kids, which better like running with  their models in light speed in their living room). So if you aren&#180;t good builder, why don&#180;t you buy Duplo? There are many figs and it doesn&#180;t take long to build it. On the contrary, I like the stricture about the mistakes in the manual. But I&#180;m sure it isn&#180;t a big problem for experienced builders.
This set is certainly one of the best LEGO models and definitely the biggest. I recommend it warmly (if you are able to raise the money, of course).

Extremely detailed and realistic, it is put together using a magnet system. this set is very useful, unlike most people think, because they're too busy chewing on their DUPLO bricks to see its majesty. It not only is great for collectors of the UCS series, but even has a miniature rebel blockade runner, that can fit inside a little hole in the  bottom of the model just like in the real movie.

"psycholis","2009-12-25T01:30:44Z","The Force is strong is this one.","The set is the biggest I've ever owned after taking a hiatus from Lego for a long time.  This set was a gift for Christmas of 2007.  I've only fully assembled it twice.  The build is fairly complicated and I recommend doing both the triangle frame pieces at the same time.  Getting a significant other to do the other piece is a plus.  Be patient during the 32 detail sections..

Instead of leaving it as a show piece for extended periods, I purchased a very large tool box to organize the pieces.  There are so many pieces that a single box wouldn't fit it!  As a showpiece, it holds together fairly well.  For transporting, the top two bridge sections can be removed and the 'frame' of the ship makes for a good handle.  It's not really meant to be a mobile Lego and I wouldn't want it to be either seeing how much it weights.

I hope you like gray pieces, because you'll get lots of them.  This isn't really a bad thing, but as a first set, you might have to be a bit creative when making your own creations.  I've done gray houses and train stations, even gray radio towers and walking robots!  It's all very gray.

Overall, I love the set.  I wish I could have afforded the Falcon (or rather, my spouse could afford it..), but the Star Destroyer is becoming a real collector's item now and I don't regret at all owning it.  I'm back in the Lego scene now and I can't wait to build more things.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Though you can't really play much with UCS sets, the whole purpose of buying it is for display. However, you CAN pick it up if you know right where the strong spots are.

"Chills","2012-11-12T16:04:11.813Z","The backbone of the mighty Imperial Navy","<p>I bought this set as a Christmas present to myself when it came out. I just left the military and started a new career so I celebrated. This set was expensive, $299.99 + tax, which is a lot for a toy, but being a huge Star Wars fan I had to have it. The Imperial Class Star Destroyer is my 2nd favorite ship (the Executor being #1), so I was very excited to get this monstrous ship and put it together. Years later, just a few months ago in fact, I sold my home and my new wife and I moved into our dream home. I ended up disassembling my entire Lego collection and have been working on rebuilding it. This set is my final set, and now I just have MISB sets left.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: This set is a lot of fun to build. It is so huge that you can't help but enjoy putting it together. Lego used some interesting building techniques with this set, like how you build two identical frame parts then flip one over and attach it with technic bricks and pins. The superstructure also uses a lot of the same, but also uses technic bricks and pins to create the angles necessary.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The hull is a lot of huge plates, held together with 2 stud-wide plates. Overall the hull plates are quite sturdy, as is the skeleton/frame. This set weighs a LOT and what Lego decided to use to connect the hull and the frame are magnets; which are less than ideal. More about this later.<br></li><li>Pro 3: New techniques that I saw for the first time were greebles and SNOT. To get the rugged effects along the sides of the hull and superstructure you end up doing a lot of greebling, then attaching the plates to pins for the SNOT look. This part of the build gets repetitious, so its best to work the steps assembly-line style. Afterward, though, you have some really detailed and cool looking sections.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 4: Overall the ship looks exactly like the Star Destroyer from ANH. The telling characteristic is the communications antenna at the top of the command tower, it stands up rather than lies flat like Destroyers in later movies. Lego really did a great job with detail. I mentioned the greebles, but they also put in turbolaster turrets, ion cannons, and the shield generator domes (there's been discussion that these are actually antenna for commo in the SW community), and the superstructure looks exactly like in the movies.</li><li>Pro 5: The mini Correllian Corvette is sweet! It even fits in the docking bay of the bigger ship. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The first negative I will say is the use of magnets is not a great way to hold the hull to the framework. They do an OK job, but as soon as you try to move the ship, the hull plates fall right off. The ship is not a very sturdy design.<br></li><li>Con 2: The other big negative with this ship is the placement of the stands. They are far back on the hull; and while they do hold the ship I have noticed that over the years the hull is so heavy it actually droops, the bow bends down. I had this displayed for about 7 years, and each year the bow was closer to the table. It is disappointing such an expensive set has these two serious flaws.</li><li>Con 3: The final negative about this set is the lack of minifigures. Sure, its a UCS set, but I would have liked to have a couple unique figures just for this set.<br></li></ul>I have 3 huge sets in my collection, this one, the Super Star Destoyer, and the new Death Star. This set is still one of my favorites, it is impressive to look at; just don't try to move it. LOL. Lego fixed all the problems I mentioned with their Super Star Destroyer, for which I'm thankful. I still love this set, though. It is so much fun to build, it has some cool techniques and pieces, it looks great on display. However, it doesn't have any playability and it is a fragile set. Used versions are going for more than it was new, which isn't surprising. This really is a great set and if you have the funds and the patience I would definitely recommend it for any Star Wars collector.<br>",TRUE,4,3,5,1,3

If your interested in buying it I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;only buying it if your a die hard fan(like me). This set is a great display model and has no play features. This set is difficult to build and I would recommend having a friend help you. This set includes no minifigures and a display plaque. I would recommend&nbsp;it if you have building experience. The average price for used 700 to 1000 U.S dollars. I would recommend&nbsp;buying it used. Overall this is a great set with few flaws. 8/10</p>
