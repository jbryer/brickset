Pros:
~ Gameplay is very good
~ Fun mini-games
~ The Island itself is VERY well-built and laid-out

Cons:
~ I've beaten the game, but people still talk as if I have one mini-game to beat, and as if the Brickster is still free(and a good guy).
~ You have to do the mini-games three times, on three different levels.  No choice, you must.  Why not just add more mini-games?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
