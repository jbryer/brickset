<p>I was stoked when I saw the first pictures for this new LEGO space theme. The sets looked amazing. I checked brickwatch on a daily basis for discounts, right until a nice one popped up, and&nbsp;I felt comfortable enough to buy this set&nbsp;(because the initial price was way too high).</p>

<p>Now that I have it, I have to admit that this is the first set since long that I have been busy playing with almost non-stop after building it. It is so swooshable, you will not believe it. It&#39;s 12 tiers make it twist and twirl and swoosh and glide and spin and turn and drift and.... I&#39;m loving it!</p>

<p>Hahaha, this is so much fun... I am having a real blast here!&nbsp;&nbsp;So why not 5 stars?</p>

<p>Well, I feel like LEGO messed up part of the interior.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong: I love the fact that all 3 figs can be seated inside the rover. I love the fact that the accessories (shovel and Chainsaw) can be stored on the back. I love the fact that different parts can open up, so you have some sort of flexibility. What I don&#39;t like is the centre compartment with the 2 computers behind the driver.</p>

<p>This space feels like a missed opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the fact that there is some kind of research-area. But why 2 computers with the same print? (The new prints aren&#39;t even that nice). Why not 1 computer, for example, 1 computer panel, 1 stud wide, a flat area with a jumper piece and maybe some sort of telescope build. Why also did they not include the new 1 x 1 round amoebae-tile... It would have made a world of difference,&nbsp;would have added so much to the playability, and could have made this set stand on his own. Now, I feel like it cannot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is such a shame: this set could have been gold, but now it ends up with silver...</p>
