The play features of the elevator and force pull and spinning function are all very good and add to the play of the set without taking too much away from the display aspect of the set. The hallway is your generic imperial hallway, but that is good as it holds accurate to the show and other media. The dark trooper figures all look great and the Luke Skywalker figure is good as well. For $30 it would not be a bad idea to pick up two of these and combine them. This makes a great play set for a child or a great display set for your desk at work or on a shelf. I would highly recommend this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some may disagree with me that this is not a battlepack since it doesn&#39;t have it written on the box, but that is what I am going to call it.</p>

<p>MINFIGURES; The best figure in this set I think is Luke Skywalker. His black robe make him look sharp and looks excellent in my MOCs. I only wish it came with his hairpiece.The dark Troopers are the real reason that people will be buying this. The helmets are true to their on-screen counterparts and their chest armour are very detailed. You can even take that off and underneath is printing.I did notice that the chest armour originated in the&quot; generic lego world &quot;.</p>

<p>MODEL; The model has way too many stickers. That aside, there isn&#39;t that much to write home about. There are several play functions, but that is useless to me. It just seems too small for what you pay, which brings me to another point.</p>

<p>PRICE; This set is overpriced at 30 dollars. It would have been fine at 20 but now with the price hikes, I am doubtful that one could get at discount.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading,</p>

"henrymorris476","2023-04-17T18:22:44.81Z","Long Live The Empire","<p>Not quite a battlepack, not quite a proper playset - but inevitably you&#39;ll buy it anyway for those Dark Troopers. Some may say it is a lazy cash grab based on hype for&nbsp;the Mandalorian Season 2 finale - and they wouldn&#39;t be entirely wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Build and Parts</strong></p>

<p>The build is fairly lacklustre in terms of what it actually consists of, being mostly a simple facade of a corridor inside Moff Gideon&#39;s Imperial cruiser. It goes together quicker than even some battlepacks because of its simplicity.&nbsp;A particular sore point is the number of stickers required to achieve any details whatsoever. However, for what it is, it does incorporate a couple of play features to recreate the scene from the show,&nbsp;and also manages to capture the feel of an Imperial setting enough to be a solid stage for the included minifigures. The turbolift particularly feels well executed at this scale. Parts-wise there is very little to write home about unless you are a particular fan of grey slopes.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Similar to a battlepack (but for a considerably higher cost), 75324 is really about the minifigures. Only one is unique to the set, and yet is probably the least desirable to most people; even so, Luke looks fantastic in his jedi robes, although it is a shame a spare hair-piece isn&#39;t included. He comes equipped with his green lightsabre, ready to make light work of some Imperial droids. The real reason most people will be buying this set though is for the three Dark Troopers, this being the second and cheapest way of acquiring them; they are excellent minifigures, and despite the strange proportions of the droids in the show, they are still able to be represented accurately as standard figures.&nbsp;The helmets particularly are a highlight. All three are armed with adequate weaponry, but you&#39;ll need at least two copies of this set to truly recreate Luke&#39;s showdown with a mass of them.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Despite the lacklustre construction and high price tag, this set will still be worth picking up for most fans of the Mandalorian for the minifigures alone. Is this a horrible business practice on Lego&#39;s part? Quite probably, but as it is still a reasonably inexpensive set you can&#39;t complain too much (and you can pick it up at a discount at most retailers anyway).</p>
