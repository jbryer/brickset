"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-27T16:47:38Z","A Classic Caravan","This camper is really great. The vehicle is very nice looking, altough it's missing doors, but since there's a canopy this isn't a drawback. It looks rather realistic, just like some real Caravans except for the canopy. The car is 4-wide, like most older sets but it has good details like the screen slopes, a stove area and all a minifig needs for travelling. There is even a bicycle hold on the caravan. But this set isn't only the caravan it has a trailer with a nice small boat, which is better then those dinghys in the sets today, because the dinghys have limited use. The trailer has room for the little boat and there's even a surfboard included. The set has two classic minifigures, but the woman hasn't the Pattern that later sets have. She has just the plain smilie face, which I don't like that much. But heck about it it's an older set. There weren't that much faces like in the mid 90s or newer town sets. Only the paradisa range figures had particularly different grins back in 1992.
But since it's a great classic it deserves a 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legofan5445","2008-02-13T10:45:10.357Z","Wonderful Caravan! ","Nice design in the caravan! Windows, esp love the rear which can open up into a mini-kitchen with stove and cups for cooking along those long highways.. 
Wish Lego made more of these caravan/holiday scheme vehicles, as whenever i look and build them i feel like going for a long holiday and it peace my mind...

Pros:  Wonderful design! 
       Nice colour contrast!
       Little boat with surf boards! 
       Two minifigs! 
       Cooking area and special way of holding bicycle! 

Cons:  Inavailibility? Got mine off ebay luckily, cause it's a pity it's discontinued
       4 studs wide, could have been 6 to make it even nicer! 
       Maybe more seats in the caravan would be nice!

"Loop","2008-01-30T17:50:24.42Z","Amazing camper!","This was the first of my bigger Lego sets. Yeah, it isn't one of the biggest, but at a time it sure was huge for me :-)

And it is just perfect. It's so full with quality content, pure fun and joy. So many things are alive here - almost everything can be opened and closed, connected and disconnected, attached and disattached. Amazing!

You get a very nice camper - you can open the front windshield, to put the driver there, you can open the middle part with some kind of storage, and the back part with a small kitchen, equiped with a stove (printed brick) and a cool frying pan (it can also be used as a weapon in the hands of the female minifig :-) ). 

Plus there is a bicycle, windsurfing board and a motorboat on a trailer! Just WOW! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-23T13:14:04.387Z","True classic","I had this set for over 10 years, and I don't plan to put it into storage anytime soon. I remember having adventures with the camper where it gets destroyed by ghosts on haunted highways, so needless to say, this set has been dismantled and put back together countless times.

Pros:

-Van's windshield opens to put driver inside
-Van's side window opens for play inside
-Van is 4 studs wide and will fit easily onto any roadplates
-There is a stove, 2 cups, 2 lifejackets, pan, and 2 computers inside
-Surfboard, sail boat, and bike
-Sail boat has realistic motor
-Includes 2 minifigures
-Trailer can detach from back of van

Cons:

-none

Overall a great classic camper. A bunker would be nice though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"James83","2013-01-03T10:57:15.94Z","Away on Holiday!","<p>This is another classic Town vehicle set and one of my all-time favourites. This set was another design classic with some ingenious thinking and it looked cool too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This camper had the modern looks shared with other bigger vehicles like the 6430 Night Patroller. It had very similar sloped brick wheel arches and front section, although on this model the canopy-style drivers windscreen is smaller. The camper has a nice white-red-blue colour scheme, which looks especially neat at the rear with the brake lights making another red band. The camper is a tall model with lots of headroom, but the wide wheeltrack with those chunky wheels keeps the vehicle stable, not that your going to be tearing over those road plates at high speed! The vehicle isn't too tricky to build but it's nice to have a vehicle set that does take some time to build rather than the usual five mintue cars.</p><p>The driving compartment is quite spacious and has a white steering wheel and a yellow seat. It is accessed by the hinged windscreen unit.&nbsp;The main compartment has, unfortunately, only one yellow seat but there is room behind the seat for a suitcase but the red sloping brick robs some space. In my camper I added a printed TV brick behind the driver's seat to add a little comfort and a second seat could easily be added. The rear of the compartment holds two mugs. The compartment is accessed by raising the roof and the sides of vehicle have tall windows to capture the view nicely. The rear compartment is a touch of genius, and in many ways makes this vehicle a classic. By swinging out the rear section to the right you gain access to a hotplate and a frying pan with its own carrying hook. The top of the compartment has a fairly rare inverted computer block. Why you need a computer when your cooking isn't obvious but its a nice touch (especially for the days before sat-nav!). The back of the camper holds a bicycle and the roof carries the windsurfing board and mast. There is also a radio aerial on the roof.</p><p>The camper comes with&nbsp;a good looking and sturdy four-wheeled trailer with rear brake lights. The trailer carries a standard, for the time, boat with the addition of an outboard motor, mast and sail. All of which stows inside, or on the sides of the boat. Stowing the life jackets can be a pain though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>The driver has blue trousers and a red cap. His printed T-shirt body is the same as that in Set 6641 4 Wheelin' Truck which came out in 1987. It fits the holiday spirit well though and makes a nice change to see a minfigure in some casual clothes. The lady companion has white trousers and a red striped body and black hair with a ponytail. These lucky campers have an impressive array of holiday equipment; two mugs, frying pan, bicycle, two lifejackets, windsurfing board with sail and a boat with sail. It's pretty rare to get one set with so many accessories and sporting equipment. It makes Set 6590 Vacation Camper look like a rainy weekend in comparison.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>I loved this set and had hours of fun with it. It's just a feelgood set with plenty of options and the camper looks great and has some neat touches. It isn't 100% perfect but it can be made so with a few own additions. If your minifigs are in need of a break then I'd recommend this set as the best vacation set ever built.</p><p>The one thing that Lego Town lacked was a bus set. During the years the inhabitants of Lego Town gained dustbin trucks, road sweepers, policemen, futuristic monorail transportation system, roadsters and monster trucks. Yet if you wanted to go around the corner for some milk your poor minifigures either had to walk or drive. So eventually I converted my camper into a bus. I fitted four seats in the main compartment and converted the swinging kitchen unit into a fixed compartment and extended the roof. The colours fitted well as a corporate colour scheme too. I think without too much effort Lego could have developed a bespoke bus version, but with the instructions you could probably build a fleet of your own. So really this set is not only a holiday classic but a versatile base vehicle in its own right.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"plexiglass","2014-08-15T04:27:48.2Z","Road Trip!","<p>This was one of the earliest sets I owned. I must have spent countless hours playing with it.</p>

<p>With its exceptional design and versatility, it&#39;s no surprised that after all these years I am still in awe.</p>

<p>It has quite a few rare pieces (bike, surfboard). And putting it together and opening up the side is so much fun. I like how they include two minifigures&nbsp;(a guy AND a girl!) and a trailer with a boat. Great value with endless possibilities in such a small system.</p>

<p>And opening up the side to reveal the inside is so much fun!</p>

<p>Putting the sail on the poles was such a pain, though.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a modern camper that looks much better, but I don&#39;t think it has the same charm or appeal as this one.</p>
