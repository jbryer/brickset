also there's an interesting part selection: many hinges, and a nice canopy. plus one more container for the old ships and trains :-).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"borg72","2008-08-30T20:16:53.077Z","stands the test of time","A Classic town set that still isn't showing its age right up with the more modern city sets.

the set comes with a 'standard' 4x8 cargo container crate, this one containing the standard model 'tractor' so often found in these containers (launch &amp; load seaport had one, and i'm guessing a few other sets did too).

The crane has a nice solid rotating brick at its centrepoint, and the large arm extends up to a good height. the fold out supports work well in keeping it stable.

my only complaint is that there is nothing to 'lock' the rotation of the crane when the arm is stowed for transport. it would have taken little to no effort to put in another small hinge arm between the base and the crane body to hold it still when driving around. still, its an easy enough modification to make for yourself, using two more of the red 'support strut &amp; hinge' pieces attached somewhere along the body of the crane that will fold up/down to stop the crane rotating when being driven.

the minifig is a nice, classic construction worker with blue dungarees and red hardhat. safety first, after all!

Pros:
still looks great today
standard cargo pallet to add to your lego container yard
an imppresive sized crane for a set this size
construction not over-simplified, an entertaining build
very minor mods would make the set even better (extra hazard tiles, tiles instead of plates for front lights, an extra lighting rig on the top of the cab and on the end of the crane arm)

cons:
crane body still turns when being driven around.
most 'port' sets (train, nautica, etc) usually come with their own cranes or forklifts, so you might think you can do without, however good this set is.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"FlyBy","2012-01-12T17:29:51.447Z","Lift Away","I got this set when it came out when I was a kid.&nbsp; I couldn't afford larger sets that had cranes included, but I actually ended up liking this model more because it can be paired with other construction sets and easily fits right in, even with today's newer sets.&nbsp; The thing I like the most about this set is that it has a metal hook, which haven't been included in sets for a long time.<br><br>In short, this is a great set to include in your city construction crew, and the crate style being identical to other crates in sets makes it easily compatible with other sets/train sets.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
