The bit at the back for lifting the little boat on and letting it off is real boss, as is the top off the ship. Easy to use the pieces in other things too, it's a grand set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

if you own and appreciate the 90's harbour/costal sets, this one ist the necessary addition to secure your transports as well as your citizens from criminal elements (just look out for those guys in 6679!).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T02:40:15.763Z","Flagship of the Fleet…","I remember getting a Coastal Cutter on it’s release and loving it, it provided many hours of entertainment and I still have it in my collection, but being young the boxes were simply cast aside and disposed of so this one is on display while I have a second 6353 in its original box untouched, thanks to eBay!

This is another favourite of mine, it works so well with the Coastal Patrol Boat (6483) and I love the ‘go anywhere’ scale.   Sets of this scale make designing and constructing a harbour or marina so much more realistic.   This boat is quite uncomplicated and simple in its appearance yet it works so well, for me anyway.   The high flying bridge works well and doesn’t look out of place like on 6483, the smooth slope from the forepeak upwards to the flying bridge looks excellent and is a gradual continuation of the lines of the boat.   The radar arch is simple yet effective and houses the blue lights, searchlights and burgee mast with radar dish.   The red antennae held in brackets on the side of the superstructure really set of the ‘importance’ of the boat.   On the hull sides are ‘handles’ I am guessing these can have a multitude of uses both when in port and out at sea.   The stern deck acts as a launch bay for the skiff, which can be effortlessly launched and recovered using the crane arrangement.   The set up of the transom allows the skiff to simply glide up and into the boat.

I have just got hold of a third 6353 which is literally the hull, deck and some transparent pieces.   When I find the required parts I shall complete this too, and I may include a small cabin under the flying bridge, who knows…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"T79","2014-07-10T09:33:21.507Z","The bane of #6679 Dark Shark","<p>The coastal cutter&#39;s reason of existence in our collection was usually to try and get the smugglers from #6679 Dark Shark. Usually they came ever so close without actually catching them though...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Mainly blue and white with some red accents as can be seen on the set&nbsp;image. Lots of useful parts too: slopes, transparent windshields and panels, large red antennae, a lot of grey plates with handle, a nice, printed control panel (too bad everything else is a sticker) and one of those rare red lift arms. Also one of the only&nbsp;2 x 2&nbsp;boat masts I had, always a favourite piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two crewmen in the old, 1980&#39;s police uniform; the captain with a white cap and the other one with his hair flowing in the wind. I much prefer these uniforms to the newer ones from the 1990&#39;s like in #6664 Chopper Cops. The icons on the boat bring more of a rescue service to mind but the police uniforms made&nbsp;us use it as a police boat too since we had none except a small speedboat from #6354 Pursuit Squad (which was hopelessly outclassed by #6679 Dark Shark).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This will now always have another special memory as it&#39;s the first set ever built by my wife, who saw the children play with lego every day and wanted to know just what they were doing up there. With her interest in ships and the sea this seemed like a logical choice&nbsp;but it did bring out that, when I see some instructions,&nbsp;I can build the set&nbsp;without even thinking about it but&nbsp;it&#39;s an entirely different affair for someone who&#39;s never played with lego before. Even our eldest child (turning five this week) was constantly correcting her but in the end she did manage to get it built. We&#39;ll see if she&#39;ll still want to build some more later on...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s easily one of my favourite ships regarding looks: it is sleek, has a nice blue-and-white colour scheme and it looks just right regarding size. The included speedboat can be lifted and lowered without problems and I like the outboard motor on the speedboat, all other small boats we had until then had some sort of jet propulsion (#6354 again) or a propeller (#6508 Wave Racer). The raised bridge looks functional and the entire superstructure has a nice slant making the ship look fast. The only issues are that the lift arm for the speedboat uses a lot of space (the entire rear deck) and with the limited width of the ship this makes it hard for the minifig to get in or out, and the fact that the entire cabin is just empty and inaccessible. Especially that last one is a bit of a shame, the cabin can be modded in and with some more tiles the entire roof can be taken off so it can be accessed, but a door to get in is harder to do as the winch for the lift arm blocks the access anyway.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A very nice ship with a few flaws, still the looks and remaining playability (especially with some added bad guys to catch) make this one very worthwhile. Having now not only the attention of my children but also of my wife is proof that it&#39;s nice enough to draw in people unfamiliar with lego as well!</p>

"plexiglass","2014-08-15T01:03:58.817Z","Nice little Boat","<p>I do not own this set but I remember assembling and playing with it at a friend&#39;s house many years ago. The fact that I still remember this shows how unique and remarkable this set is.</p>

<p>It has nice, early 90s primary colors. Assembling it was a lot of fun since there were many interesting pieces and I enjoyed how it took form. It hardly looks dated; if it were re-released today I am sure it would be very popular.</p>

<p>The main drawback is that it does not float. Which is odd, considering that it came from a series with mostly floating boats.</p>

<p>Overall I think these not one, but two boats makes a great addition to any harbor or even just any play experience.</p>

<p>Want to know what makes this whole set worth it? The&nbsp;<strong>winch</strong>. Seriously, I could wind the little motorboat all day with that.</p>
