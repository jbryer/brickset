"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-07T10:42:04Z","Good parts booster","When I got this set when it was released in Australia in 1991 I thought ir was great as it was only the second police set I had ever recieverd. In retrospect it really is only an average set. Mainly because of the mediocrity of the design of the models. All of them are sturdy and well made but oh so boring. Like the boat doesn't even have a fold up outboard motor. And the only distinguishing feature on the helicopter is the video camera and floodlights and both of these have been done many times before and since. The jeep and trailer are of course totally generic and the only play items that come with the set are a radio and a few road markers. Then to cap it all off all the bricks printed with &quot;POLICE&quot; now are no longer compatible with the rest of my collection as I use the more recent &quot;POLICE&quot; underlined with a red line.
But it was good while it lasted and there is no lego set that I own that I am not thankful for.

"jimcha","2005-11-19T06:54:25Z","very average","I had high hopes for this set, and those were shot down when I got it.  A good supply of pieces (mostly white) is its strongest suit.  The helicopter is weak/wimpy and the truck is boring.  I actually like the boat and trailer, the boat has a different propulsion system than that of 6698 and is probably faster!   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It has a police motorcycle, a helicopter, a boat with a trailer, a police SUV, and 3 minifigures. I really like the old motorcycles which Lego should bring back. Nothing is wrong with this set and is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bizkit","2008-09-25T03:52:11.873Z","Great set!","I don't know why most of the people think that this is an average set, it was a great set of it's time and you can't really compare it to the newer sets. It's not boring at all, or at least wasn't, I played a lot with it in the 90s. It was my first set to, got it from Canada in 1990, and I had no other set for 2 more years and never got bored with it. Even shared it with my brother, he got the helicopter and the motorcycle, I had the car and the boat with the trailer. I could only be complaining about the car, the rest were nicely designed.
So if you are a collector or have a Lego city, you should get this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-23T01:56:57.787Z","Pursuit Squad Review","<p>I was always very taken with this set, especially as a whole. I had a Police Station set and this greatly added to the fleet of vehicles and number of Cops for my City/Town themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A helicopter that I felt improved on the one from my Police set, another motorcycle (You can never have too many of these) and a car with a trailer and small police boat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, this set was perfect. The right ammount of vehicles, variety to them, Police minifigures. It added value to my Police Station. I've always enjoyed it. Nowadays, there are more detailed vehicles and they'd each be sold separately.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Rijkvv","2021-04-06T18:37:44.887Z","One of the better non-station police sets.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Pursuit Squad is one of those sets that I didn&rsquo;t really care about as a kid, but began to appreciate as an adult. Other than buying an actual police station, which could be expensive, this was probably the best pick to get a police squad to patrol your town. Four vehicles no less.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>The build.</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The instructions are printed on an A5-sized booklet, containing 12 pages. The building process is straight-forward, without advanced building techniques. No part call-outs though.</p>

<p><strong>The whole set.</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">First we start with the motorcycle. It&rsquo;s just the standard Classic Town motorcycle, nothing special. In fact, it lacks an emergency light. A trans blue plate is a common piece, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a spare piece was included in this set, but not adding it as standard is just sloppy. On the sides, printed tiles with &ldquo;POLICE&rdquo; are added. It&rsquo;s nice to get printed pieces. Every pattern is printed in this set, no stickers.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Next up is the car. Looking at the big tyres I think it&rsquo;s some sort of pick-up or 4x4. It looks a bit boring in my eyes. All white, while most vehicles had some black accents, which makes them a bit more interesting to me. A few printed panels, and some warning beacons and a sign in the back. The sign is held in place by the beacons, but it&rsquo;s a bit wobbly. Not as secure as in 6533.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The 4x4 is provided with a towhook, which can draw a small trailer. This trailer is mostly gray, with a few lights. Simple, yet effective. The trailer carries a small boat. There have been quite a number of similar boats released, but to my surprise this one doesn&rsquo;t have an outboard motor, but a few jet nozzles. A life vest provides some safety.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Last but not least is the helicopter. It&rsquo;s one of the better equipped choppers, and this is a bit opposite to what I saw with the bike and car. It contains a walkie-talkie, camera and a few search lights. If you ever consider getting this set, make sure that the bars 1x6, used for the undercarriage,&nbsp;are of the old type. The open studs are where the search lights are stuck in.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Conclusion.</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The individual vehicles are nothing special, and in case of the motorcycle even lacking (though that&rsquo;s a quick fix). But together it&rsquo;s a nice, complete police force which leaves little to be desired.</p>

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-06T05:30:38.113Z","We Need Back Up!","<p>Depending on the police station you got, this collection of vehicles were either exciting or a repeat performance.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p><b>[&middot;</b><b>&middot;]</b><b>[</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;]</b><b>[</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;]</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Less used zipper top with flat cap.</li>
	<li>Yellow lifejacket.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>In Pursuit</b><br />
Set 6386 already contained&nbsp;a land rover/ jeep style police wagon as did the later 6533. A similar but less kitted out helicopter pre-existed as 6642. For this era of Police before re-design, a small boat/ dinghy was only available in the station set 6540.&nbsp;I would promote this collection for containing better versions of all vehicles unless you prefer more black sections on the wagon. This is largely because:</p>

<div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>The boat gets a trailer.</li>
	<li>The helicopter has more black and grey with a snazzy camera added.</li>
	<li>A unique bike is included that completes the set.</li>
</ul>

<p>???????The grey trailer is useful with rear lights and a ball and socket joint for towing by the 4x4. Its rack design and wheels are great with smooth black plates for the boat to sit on a connect to a couple of studs.</p>

<p>The boat is very similar, possibly the same as the station set and has a lifejacket provided. A reviewer mentioned the lack of an outboard motor that folds and the set is not without regular flaws that we like to nitpick about but it is a decent dinghy of just two for the whole period of Police before the red line stuff that you will either have continued with or stopped at.</p>

<p>The 4x4 is very white but has the cones and road sign used in a later and previous set -good extras as the cones are white with blue lights, later blue cones with yellow lights. Chunky and solid, its almost a repeat but actually an excellent design that suits the Police and is a prominent model. Remember it can tow as well with the socket.</p>

<p>The helicopter has plenty of black, still sadly missing two top smaller cross blade plates for completion. A brilliant surveillance camera build and the usual lights surround the cool bluey cockpit and a cb radio clips on neatly. A tight fit but the driver gets red based control sticks, a colour variation welcome here and there in the mostly white and black sets. For example,&nbsp;red is the antennae base on the motorbike, strangely without a blue light although&nbsp;a spare could be added, it is otherwise an ordinary choice but unique for the antennae and missing light.</p>

<p><b>Roll Out</b><br />
Overall this could appear as an additional reinforcement of vehicles where needed. If you do need or want such types then it is a very recommended set and a star of the last of the original design Police sets. You need not much more past these transports. With the brilliant police badge tiles all round, they fit in great and are one of the most fulfilling for the early cop collection. The Police sets stop here for me, literally needing nothing more, until they make...<br />

"James83","2012-07-21T12:04:27.44Z","Ready for Anything","<p>I brought this set to bolster my police force and it goes well with Set 6386.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p>The Police Truck is another all-road vehicle that Lego Police seem so fond of. It is a good modernisation of the truck with Set 6386 but is all-white. It has chunky tyres, excellent ground clearance, ball socket towbar and space in its rear cargo area for two small cones with blue lights on top and a warning sign. If you have Set 6386 you can replace those with the cone from that set (which I think looks better). The red and blue lights are an obvious American style feature, and this set feel much more American than European. The double 1x1 flat brick lights though look good. A radio antenna completes the vehicle. The truck is very durable and can stand rough handling.</p><p>The trailer is a basic boat trailer but it looks quite sleek and has smart round brake lights.</p><p>The boat is a typical small dingy type with windscreen and police sign. It's small but does the job and looks ok with that black line to break up the colours a bit. A lifejacket is also included.</p><p>The helicopter is a first-class design with the excellent blue visor piece, sturdy landing skids,&nbsp;control stalks,&nbsp;camera, walke-talkie stowage and spotlights underneath. It has red and green navigation lights, Police signs on the rear fuselage and has some nice sloped elements to enhance its sleekness. The rotors are basic and can be flimsy depending on the fit, the tailboom has an anti-torque rotor and red light on top.</p><p>The motorbike is quite basic with Police signs, red antenna and no light. That can be easily added.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Three Policemen with zipped Police suits, two with white helmets with visors and one with a cap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>As an addition to any Police Station this set offers not only an increase in manpower but also provides a response to any situation. How many other sets included four vehicles and a trailer? All of the four vehicles are well designed and the bike is a good extra to this set. It's an absolute bargain to get this many elements in one fairly cheap package. This offers unlimited options for play and is a great package. A must-have for any classic Town&nbsp;Police fan.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
