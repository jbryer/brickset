I like the clear Technic-style wheels on the carriage, which I imagine are hard to get.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-10-14T01:25:11Z","Cosy Stable on Your Table!","This is a nice little set with a lot of charm inherent in the old-fashioned chimney,  cheerful blue stable doors, and, of course, in the zippy little yellow buggy itself! A brown-coloured horse and a mini-fig wearing a black riding helmet completes the rustic romance of a brisk country trot in the sunshine!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-26T20:51:08Z","Derby Trotter Review","This set was released in 1989 and is overall a pretty good set. I like the brown horse because they are rare nowadays. Also, the cart is very nice and fun to play with. The shed and stable are very cool and great for a horse to live in. This is really a fantastic set and is great to have in your town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-28T09:47:49.247Z","Very nice and compact","This small building is a very nice addition to the country section of a Legoland diorama.

It is very simply a small stable for one horse with a small green area, but the color scheme and the arches makes it look very stylish for the countryside.

There are some small clever ideas, such as using a backhoe piece as the horse food/water tank, or the design of the diminutive lights above the entrance.

The empty garden is a bit of an oddity, but suggests that the house is next to a meadow, as is the chimney on the roof (or is it a ventilation escape for the dung?).

Two possible improvements would have been one more addition to the interiors, and a better plate than the grey one (a green plate with a flat rock road in the same style as the Holiday Villa would have been perfect).

As a final touch, having both a small sulky for trotting (a chair would have made it perfect) and a saddle for galloping is really nice.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-16T12:10:03.693Z","Derby Trotter Review","<p>This is clearly to me, a scaled down and cheaper set or version of the Riding Stable set. I think the next step I was hopeful for was seeing LEGO do a horse track and racing... which could still be doable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small meadow off to the side for the horse to graze in. A saddle so the minifig can ride the horse instead of using that little carriage deal. Accessories for ""cleaning"" a horse stall, ministable and haybales. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a decent little set, either cheap version or companion piece to the Riding Stable. It doesn't seem to have the hours of fun the Stable does, but does alright for those who haven't picked up anything from Belville series with horses.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-15T20:00:25.42Z","Derby Trotter and the Chamber of Secrets.","<div>I’m digging deep into the recesses of my memory here, and I’m not sure that I like it.</div><div><br></div><div>I would have been pretty young when Derby Trotter was released, so I’m not exactly sure that I was playing with this in 1989. At the same time, I distinctly remember taking great ownership of this specific set, and, after having scoured through BrickSet’s datebases, it’s the oldest one that I can remember actually receiving and building. This is the genesis, if you will.</div><div><br></div><div>Derby Trotter is just straight-up cute. Two cute square bases - one for the stable and one for the adjacent meadow - are joined together to create a tranquil little scene that wouldn’t be out of place in rural Europe somewhere. The build is as simple as they come, but the result captures a number of nice little details, including a chimney, a pair of lights above the door, and a set of horse-grooming tools. The meadow is empty, but who needs a meadow filled with stuff when you have a horse that can run around in it all day?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If I forcefully overcome nostalgia for the sake of objectivity, I suppose I would knock off a few points for the carriage, which is about as rudimentary as they come. I don’t know how I’m supposed to interpret that, but it feels like it’s pretty much a plank of wood with wheels attached to a horse. Compare this to, say, Prison Carriage Rescue (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7949-1"">7949</a>), which has a similarly small carriage but with sufficient details that are enough to give someone an idea of what’s going on. And yes, I realise that perhaps the comparison isn’t entirely fair and that the piece count would have climbed by quite a bit, but I’m just saying.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For folks yearning for the simpler days, it really doesn’t get much simpler than this without regressing, say, to pre-Minifig days. More than that, though, is that Derby Trotter carries with it a fair bit of charm along with its simplicity. Not every set needs to be a Death Star (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10188-1"">10188</a>), right?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,2,3,3,4
"knightofgold","2016-04-15T01:14:50.983Z","One of the stranger town sets","<p>I think I received this as a birthday gift around 1990. I was never a big Town fan and was more interested in Castle, Space, and Pirates. This set was always a mixed bag, the large doors and red brick pieces were always useful. Unfortunately&nbsp;the way the set attaches to the two base plates, it always came apart way too easily. For being played with that made the main structure way too weak. It looks nice as a completed model, but was way too flimsy when being played with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure was very boring and the only thing interesting was the hat. The little horse racing harness was always flimsy and came apart easily. The wheels were nice, but useless for anything else. I think I had more fun with the horse.</p>

<p>As a kid I always ended up using the pieces from this set to build other buildings. After loosing the instructions, I just forgot about this set and never built it again. I only rediscovered&nbsp;how to build it thanks to the internet.</p>

"Wipipi","2017-06-16T00:04:54.137Z","Favorite Lego Set EVER!","<p>This set, Derby Trotter, is my&nbsp;<strong>favorite</strong>&nbsp;Lego set&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong>! The build, playability, everything, is amazing! Here is why.</p>

<p><strong>-Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fun to play with!</li>
	<li>Amazing build!</li>
	<li>Very rare pieces, like the black saddle.</li>
	<li>Vintage and nostalgic!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Some people may say it lacks in playability. I guess they could of added another horse and carriage to have a little &quot;Derby Trotter&quot; since that&#39;s literally the name of the set.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this is one of the greatest Town Lego sets I have ever encountered. If you want to expand your town collection, I&nbsp;<strong>highly</strong>&nbsp;recommend this Lego set. But, this IS just my opinion. It&#39;s ok if you dislike this set, since we all have different interests. Overall, I give this set a 10/10.</p>
