"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-05T16:54:15Z","Decent set, with some quirks","This set has some cool distinguishing features - the only 4 engine prop plane I've ever seen in Lego, and the only one with a boom tail design.  The swing-away back door to the plane is pretty cool, though the conventional lift-top aircraft are actually easier to get into.  My probalems with this set are the fairly bland mini-figs and the awkward proportions of the plane - it looks a little funny.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lordjim13","2006-08-01T19:40:26Z","Clever little plane.","The swing-open rear hatch was very cool, so that the stretcher could slip inside, and the double-tail (so that the rear door could work) was well done. Was a nice complement to the passenger jets--had the high wing and general prop-plane feel to it.  And all in a simple, compact model.  Brilliant.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-28T10:04:01.403Z","Very good design","A typical airplane design of the 80's and 90's, this flying ambulance has a very nice and original appearance due to the double tail and the four propeller blades.

The inside of the plane has enough room for both the patient on the stretcher and the doctor, besides the pilot. The plane opens easily at its side to operate the minifigs in the back, but the front roof needs to be removed to get to the pilot.

Three figures for a medium-small set is better than average.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-02-27T12:57:22.89Z","4 engines and a great design","I loved the design of this airplane.  It was great first that it included three minifigs, but on top of that, to be able to fit all three as well as a stretcher into the body of the little plane.  This is something that I definitely appreciate.

The idea behind the front wheel being able to rotate was a fun design feature, but not in the playability of the vehicle. The wheel would often rotate out of position on &quot;landing.&quot;

The four engine design looks great, and the design of the engines themselves are very good.  They blend well into the wings, which is no small feat as the wings are angled.

The twin boom tail was also a great design feature, doubling as functional to allow the back end of the plane to open and allow the stretcher.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickford","2010-12-24T07:17:43.193Z","Five star med-star","I remember when I blew my birthday money on the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6392-1"">6392-1 Airport</a> in 1985, that I also wanted this Med-Star Rescue Plane. It didn't happen though. <br><br>The <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6380-1"">6380-1 Emergency Treatment Centre</a> wasn't yet released, so all I had was the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6364-1"">6364-1 Paramedic Unit</a> - which was far too small to handle the national emergencies that this set could bring into town.<br><br>So, 25 years after its release, I finally got it - buying the pieces I needed to build it up from scratch. <br><br>This set is fantastic and fits in perfectly with the aircraft and airport of the time, and still looks similar to the types of plane you'd find flying medical staff around these days.<br><br>The three minifigs suit the set, and the stretcher would have been a great new piece to have back in 1985.<br><br>The plane itself is sturdy and well designed, with a hinged back so that you can slide the stretcher in, and it's a relatively easy build from the instructions. A highly recommended piece for any city.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"J_tje","2010-02-06T04:41:54.357Z","Must have!","Great addition to the one year earlier released Hospital. 
Complete with 3 minifigs, brancard and room for it all, not only great for town collections, also a must have for plane collectors.

Not that many special parts, still hard to reconstruct from scratch.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bjornkeizers","2015-09-28T14:04:59.84Z","This started my love for aviation.","<p>The Med-Star ambulance aircraft was one of the reasons for my growing love of aviation as a kid. Combining both my fondness of LEGO as well as planes, it was no surprise that I eventually ended up with not one but TWO of these sets. And now that I&#39;m getting back into LEGO.... I just bought another one.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are typical for this era. The front is a simple profile shot of the aircraft, stretcher, patient and minifigs. The back features the usual wacky alternate models. That&#39;s not why we&#39;re here though: stick with the Med-Star. Instructions are relatively short and simple.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts selection is again typical of the era, with the usual inverted slope and domed slopes that make up the aircraft fuselage. Add in a windscreen, nose, two wings, a couple props and you&#39;re there. Some of these parts are relatively rare these days, like the hinged roof pieces. That&#39;s simply not &#39;how it&#39;s done&#39; these days.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three included, a very boring patient, a physician minifigure and a pilot figure. That one does bother me a bit: why not a second medical print? This guy looks like&#39;s flying jumbos for Pan Am instead of a medivac.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straightforward. You can pretty much build it without instructions just from looking at the box.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A joy to handle and looks great on the runway. Good play features and a nice overall realistic shape.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>
