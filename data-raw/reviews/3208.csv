"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-09T21:49:06Z","GREAT!!!","I remember getting this set while I was in the hospital a couple years back and I loved it, definetly one of my best ever.  The alternive possibilitys are endless(if you really want to take it apart). I built a go-kart, firetruck, mega helicopter, cargo truck, and a speedboat.  It really entertained me when I was in the hospital.  The Nurses let me play with it and i guess since me and it were inseperatable let me keep it.  Iwas so happy when I got it.  Overall a must have1  Get it now if you can. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kurttkrueger","2006-02-01T05:06:58Z","Fantastic!!!","I first had this set at the age of 8, some 17 years ago!!! A great set, with amazing playability value.

I loved the big rig look of the truck, and the trailer had an excellent design for keeping the chopper on while in transit. The chopper itself is well designed, and looks really cool. 

I also love the colour scheme of this set, as I think they complement each other really well. Also, gotta love those doors!!!

All in all, a great set worth getting if you see it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-04-01T06:21:13.747Z","The best Town medium set","This is simple the best set for it sice and years.
I remember playing only with this set a long time a go, it was a very important part of mi city.
The helicopter has the best design I have seen.
The minifigures are great, I lost the pilot around 3 years ago and finally maneged to get one replace using bricklink.
Overall a 5 for all the great memories ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T02:07:01.39Z","Love this set-simple and yet has much to offer","Got this one from a 20 year old down the street. He still had the instruction and I had to dig into my extra piece bin a few times to complete the model. Anything with a trailer is fun to play with I like the simple design of the set. I am glad he mentioned it to me, I got a few other older sets from the late 80's and early 90's for a great price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"badger740671","2009-05-14T10:54:49.077Z","Best colour scheme","I can still remember getting this set - I had/have an obsession with trucks and loved it. The colour scheme was brilliant which included the doors - which then made a number of re-appearances (as well as the colour scheme).

I loved the lowloader style trailer with the smaller tyres and the step down.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-16T12:25:37.617Z","Stunt Copter Review","<p>Looking at this, I am suddenly reminded of having taken the base model of truck and trailer from this and combining it with the Utility Truck set to do a bit of a Mad Max Road Warrior theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I got this back in the 80's or 90's as part of an age where me and my cousin who played Legos wanted to get all of the sets we could. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't recall being impressed by the Helicopter, but I think that's because I had several other sets that also had helicopters or were a helicopter like the Police and Fire Copters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I did really like the big truck and trailer, lots of possibilities with it. If I did it again, I still think I would have bought it. After all it was my money and not a gift from relatives for a Holiday or Occassion.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- the truck</li><li>- color scheme, especially the doors of the truck</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- senseless</li><li>- expensive<br></li></ul>
<p>There is no difference whether this set belongs to your collection or not. I admit that I'm annoyed of this amount of useless helicopters in the sets.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
"Gamlebilrokker","2020-06-23T12:08:15.963Z","The perfect set!","<p>This might be one of the best sets of the 80ies, three models, all fantastically sturdy and playable, especially the helicopter is a joy to put together and a perfect toy. Rare: all B-models are fantastic too, and look as good or better than whatever you could find in the 1988 catalogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seriously good toy that stood the test of time, and can be enjoyed by a child today, 32 years later.</p>

"Rickenbacker","2013-01-15T06:12:28.807Z","Neat, self-contained little set.","<p>A stunt pilot and his truck driver - a perfect set for the heli-lover and two neat vehicles to boot!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fun, simple build.</li><li>Nice, unusual red-yellow-black color scheme.</li><li>Neat, compact helicopter on a full-size truck.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>None, really.</li></ul>
<p>This is a simple, self-contained little set with a stunt helicopter and a truck to presumably transport it from show to show. The truck is a fun build, the trailer is separate (and very simple, yet sturdy when finished) and the heli is a third separate build. When finished, you have a set that looks great with the uncommon color scheme, and has loads of playability. The heli is reminiscent of the old fire heli, but more compact, and very swooshable, if you're into that sort of thing. Overall, a very nice set that can be had for little money these days.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
"canbayram","2017-11-01T08:10:02.45Z","Genius classic set","<p>I remember having and playing with this set for hours when I was a kid. I played so much that more than a few pieces can&#39;t even hang on any longer. Because of that I have lost a few of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The color scheme and the design is brilliant. The doors, retractable stand for the trailer, opening helicopter cockpit and the truck cab. They are all perfect. Also there are two minifigs that have a similar design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can still buy the set somewhere, get it with no hesitation. It is satisfying to keep it in your collection.&nbsp;</p>
