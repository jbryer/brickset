"cameljockie","2009-07-31T04:32:08.013Z","80s fire engine","This must havebeen one of the first sets ever bought for me. infact I got it so young, I only have vague memories of it.

All I do know is that I used to play with a lot. One reason for this that for a long time this was the only articulated fire engine you could get your hands on.

Unfortunatly I vandalised it and set hasnt been rebuilt for about 15 years! But the instruction manual still remains and really is an interesting insight into how this model was conjured up.

The design; as far as 80s town themed vehicles go, was pretty good. The extendable cherry picker was a great idea and at the time was not seen on many other vehicles. The lenghty fire hose with the fire logo print (not sticker!) and the fold out stabilizers, and storage container were neat touches. Theres even a steering wheel for swiveling the cherry picker. Of course now this would be replaced by some printed control panel.

The Fireman admitedly look dated by todays modern printing, but at thet time made a whole load of sense. Its glad to know that the fire helmets havent changed in all these years.

Its interestng to note that in recent years, Lego has started emulate this kind of design. The fire truck in 7945 uses the cherry picker in a similar, if not a more elaborate way. 

So it can said that vehicles from around 2005 onwards have finaly caught up with the traditional play values that this model shows. But now with some many new pieces avaialble for making even more playable and realistic sets, this one struggles to compete: it just looks, and feels too basic. Furthermore, Lego Trucks now are much more to scale, and if this had been made now itd be pretty monsterous!

However if you are the kind of purpose who is nostalgic and loves their classic 80s/90s lego than this vehicle is a must for the display case.

It is perhaps one of the more complex and thoughtful Town vehicles of the classic late 80s era.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The designers of this vehicle must of had a fun time. It it perhaps the only double-jointed multi-wheel vehicle of that era. To build its trickier than the more basic vans and cars but has some nice touches. The cab looks great with its red and white detailing, slim lights, roof light bar and that cool sloping bottom section. The chunky wheels give this an authentic truck-feel too. The chassis is double-jointed, perfect for getting into tight corners. The stabilisers are tricky to work well without them falling off, but the stow neatly into the chassis. The rear section features two storage cabinets and a wheel for ""steering"" the tail unit, a really nice feature. The cherry picker unit looks great with its sloping bricks and vents and the printed fire logo on the hose drum unit. The cherry picker can reach dizzy heights and the hose fully reaches too. Also the stabilisers do keep the vehicle steady when elevated too. The only drawbacks are the elevating gear. It consists of two 1x4 smooth flat bricks holding onto a series of grill bricks. They can slip off at certain angles of elevation and lead to some embrassing accidents for the poor fireman up top! The set isn't totally sturdy, the ball-and-cup joint at the back can come off but this aside its one of the best Lego&nbsp;fire engines ever designed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Two firemen with one oxygen backpack and fire extinguisher. The cabinets can hold more gear, adding an axe and other hand tool from other sets is pretty easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>Hours of fun. Yes, sometimes its not sturdy after a high-speed response, but it looks cool and the cherry picker is unique and works well. Set 6643, the Fire Chief's&nbsp;Truck, is a perfect accompaniment.&nbsp;If you break this set down you can build all kinds of other fire engines, but really this looks realistic and its hard to beat. It gives you the perfect excuse to go and build a high-rise block of flats too!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"Graysmith","2012-01-02T19:16:07.423Z","Town's Finest Fire Squad","Growing up, the firefighters of the Town theme were my favourites alongside the spacemen of Classic Space, and that's still true today. I still hold a big soft spot for the firefighter sets coming out today, but for my money LEGO never topped the Snorkel Squad. Admittedly, I owned it as a kid so surely there's a lot of nostalgia involved in that thinking, but that doesn't really change the fact that this is one gorgeous, special fire truck. I think the reason this one stands above the rest for me is because of how unusual it looks. While most LEGO fire trucks seem rooted in some kind of reality, this one is more imaginative and distinct, more like something sprung from imagination rather than trying to look as real as possible. Compare it to its present-day equivalent <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7239-1"">7239</a> and the new one (as nice as it is, and it is very nice) just looks kinda boring. It may look more realistic, but the Snorkel Squad truck is the one that sticks to your mind as it has to mine for 25 years.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
