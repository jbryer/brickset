I don&#39;t think I have ever seen a Technic model with so many parts squeezed into such a small space, to the extent that I found it a fairly challenging build. It has a four-cylinder engine across the frame, unusually with a transparent cylinder block which allows a limited view of the piston and crankshaft movement. There is a two-speed and neutral gearbox with a kick lever control. Full front and rear suspension, with telescopic front forks and a very nice rear sprung piston under the seat. Lots of external detail to the engine block adds to the realism. A really beautiful pair of front brake disks with brake callers sets off the front wheel, complete with front and rear brake cables. A choice of three dashboards, under a hard plastic screen, can easily be interchanged. Comes with a sturdy display stand with info board, and the model is mostly built on the stand. There is also a racing stand which looks good, but I found it to be too flexible and makes a very precarious holder. The gold drive chain has 63 links, but I found it a bit slack and benefited from the removal of one link.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of stickers as befits a racing machine, the only ones I found slightly difficult to apply were some smaller black &#39;carbon fibre&#39; ones on a black surface which requires good lighting. I found some black to black part connections in a very confined space needed a small torch to locate properly.</p>

<p>From a play point of view some of the fairing panels are quite easily dislodged, but this is a superb display model and a very satisfying build.</p>

Upon releasing the 1:5 scale BMW set LEGO has crossed another size barrier as far as motorcycle sets are concerned. With 1920 pieces, it surpasses the second-biggest 42107 Ducati Panigale V4R three times. Since it&#39;s the first time Lego released such big model, a few new parts needed to be introduced, such as tires, rims, front dampers and some others i haven&#39;t identified (the instruction states there are eight new bricks). The model also is the first motorcycle dedicated to AFOLs with an +18 label. And for a reason, the assembly is challenging and unless being a really experienced builder, a child would have difficulties building this monster of a set. Unfortunately, the set to me is not 100% perfect, below is the answer why.</p>

<p>The box contains another, smaller box and a lot of plastic bags containing the bricks. There are also the wheels, lying loose inside the box, the thick manual and two sheets of stickers. The bags&nbsp;are numbered from 1-5, and so&nbsp;are the corresponding chapters in the manual. The book itself has 382 pages, contains a short introduction, presentation of both the original motorcycle and its LEGO replica and the 721 steps of assembly guide.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the assembly is divided in 5 stages, below are their leading themes and approximate times of completion:</p>

<p>Stage 1: the engine and 4-step gearbox, 2 hours, ca. 80 pages</p>

<p>Stage 2: the exhibition stand and partially frame, 1 hour 10 minutes, ca. 70 pages</p>

<p>Stage 3: the chassis, suspension and wheels, 2 hours, ca. 90 pages</p>

<p>Stage 4: some fairings, the motorcycle head with cockpit, 1 hour 10 minutes, ca. 60 pages</p>

<p>Stage 5: the remaining fairings, exhaust pipe and another stand, 1 hour 40 minutes, ca. 70 pages</p>

<p>As a medium experienced builder I managed to fully assemble the motorcycle in 8 hours. A lot of the time would be saved if not for the enormous amount of stickers (about 70). Putting them on the fairings was really time-consuming as I wanted everything to look perfect. The stickers made the last 2 stages quite boring for me, while the most enjoyable stages would probably be 1 and 2. All in all I consider the assembly very enjoyable, although&nbsp;some skill and strong fingers are required as some parts are really hard to join, especially the cross axles.</p>

<p>The model is incredibly detailed, it practically has almost everything a motorcycle has. Besides the obvious elements such as the working front and rear suspension and working 4-step gearbox (1-N-2-3) with in-line 4 cylinder engine&nbsp;you can find the brake fluid reservoir, the brake levers, the brake wires, calipers, the quickshifter, footrests, the rear brake lever and many, many more. The only thing that&#39;s missing is, to my despair, the kickstand. I don&#39;t understand how it could have been skipped. They&#39;ve done the same thing as&nbsp;with the Ducati - instead of the kickstand, they threw the rear paddock stand. However, while there was some reason&nbsp;to do it in Ducati - I mean the model needs to stand, right? - here we got TWO stands - the aforementioned rear paddock and the yellow display stand with sticker containing motorcycle info on it. Why do such thing? Why do I need two stands? That is something I cannot find a logical explanation for. This is stupid.</p>

<p>The construction of the motorcycle is rather durable, a ton of beams and connectors make the model compact and resistant to damage, with one exception - some System bricks were used in this model, mainly for some fuel tank elements, headlights and the front radiator. The connection between them and the rest of the bike is via connector pegs with knobs (item no. 4274). It is a very weak connection making some parts easy to fall off and this has happened to me during the assembly several times. If I was asked about what should be changed in the build, I&#39;d say those System parts. Other than that, I have no objections.</p>

<p>The set is beautiful, it resembles the original machine and is fun to play, though its size&nbsp;and weight may be problematic if anyone would like to ride it around the room - the weight of the motorcycle itself is 1355 grams, with both stands it weighs 1827 grams - almost two kilograms!&nbsp;It is however meant for standing proudly on the desk or a cupboard rather than playing.</p>

<p>Despite some flaws I mentioned, I consider the set a must-buy for every motorcycle fan. I also strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a good building experience. It&#39;s truly the crown jewel of my collection.</p>
