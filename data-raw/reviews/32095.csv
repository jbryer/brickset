Although the build took me a mere 15 minutes, I was surprised at how enjoyable such a tiny set can be.</p>

<p>The motorcycle if of medium-small size compared to other models. The closest Technic motorcycle models of comparable size are 8210, 8251 and&nbsp;8810 - it&#39;s only slightly bigger. The closest in size model I found is 8370, although it&#39;s not really a Technic model. But yeah, it is of the same size.</p>

<p>It is PRETTY. Looks like a true chopper with a classic round headlight, large exhaust pipe and monkey-ish handlebar. Not really much to complain, although the proportions seem a bit distorted here and there, like an overgrown, compared to the rest of the bike, drive chain.</p>

<p>But by the way, this set HAS A CHAIN! There&#39;s no other motorcycle model&nbsp;in this scale&nbsp;that has got a chain. And, since it has a chain, it obviously, has a power transmission - another cool thing - to the engine area with three miniature pistons - the construction of those is unique, I don&#39;t remember seeing a model with this kind of pistons, built of connectors and white round 1x1 plates - they really look cute. As every other set, it has a rotating steering wheel and some more details like the aforementioned exhaust pipe, footrests&nbsp;&nbsp;and... that&#39;s pretty much it. Too bad it doesn&#39;t have a suspended front fork. But oh well, you cannot have them all. Not in a set that small, so there&#39;s really nothing to complain about. Truth is it has more features that most of the similar sized sets.</p>

<p>The colours of the bricks are neat, a bright red frame with medium stone grey engine and black fuel tank, seat and tires. I like them.</p>

<p>The build time, like mentioned before, was short but enjoyable. Also, I got a pretty large batch of spare parts with it - 6 as far as I remember, quite a lot as for set that small. All in all I&#39;m glad LEGO released this model. It will be a great addition to my collection. A price is fair so I recommend this one everyone, both kids and AFOLs.</p>
