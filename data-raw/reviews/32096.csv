"Hammy_the_horrible","2022-03-12T23:54:23.047Z","Low price, good functions. What more could we ask for?","<p>This set has all you could ask for at a low, low price.</p>

<p>- steering from knob above the driving compartment, with a decent turning radius.</p>

<p>- boom operated from knob at the rear. It sticks out a bit, but it&#39;s convenient for access.</p>

<p>- angle of fork is&nbsp;adjustable manually&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- nice functions&nbsp;</p>

<p>- low price&nbsp;</p>

<p>- nice little secondary build</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- the pallet is empty, boohoo.</p>
