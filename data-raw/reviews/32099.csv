<p>I was excited to see another farm entry appear on the LEGO landscape and was intrigued to see that it was constructed with technic parts.&nbsp; I earmarked this set and happened to find it on discount at the local grocery (Meijer) at 15% off.&nbsp; Having grown up in the country, with both a father, grandfather and neighbor, who all farmed the land around us, I was definitely going to pick up this set.</p>

<p>The build was relatively easy, but complicated enough that it was entertaining to build.&nbsp; I would imagine that most kids over 8 would get a kick out of this set and would be a nice intro to the technic world of LEGO.&nbsp; It delivers an accurate shape and color for the subject matter of a bright green and yellow John Deere machine!&nbsp; I love the giant tractor tires with the yellow rims - that really makes this set stand out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It comes with an average size sticker sheet, mostly for the JD branding on the wagon and on the tractor.&nbsp; A large sticker in used for the roof of the cabin and on the side panels of the tractor, there is a sticker used to indicate a ladder and the other side is a machinery look.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve added some pics so you can see relative size to other types of LEGO components.&nbsp; For instance, you can fit a 6 wide (or 8 wide) vehicle in the back wagon with ease.&nbsp; My one gripe with the back wagon is a lack of a tailgate.&nbsp; I supposed it could be added with some extra pieces, though I don&#39;t have that sort of technic part&nbsp;inventory to try and add one myself.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>For a smaller technic set - it has a couple of alright functions on it.&nbsp; You can use the back gear to swivel the back end of the tractor left and right.&nbsp; Also, there is a dumping mechanism on the wagon.&nbsp; Just by turning the lever on the underside of the wagon, it will tilt up the back and release your cargo.&nbsp; It&#39;s a nifty contraption that stays at whatever level you want it too.&nbsp; I appreciate the simple, yet effective gear arm usage to achieve this!&nbsp; The top of the cab is easy to remove and you can sit a mini-doll or a mini figure in the cockpit, as there is a miniature seat and steering wheel.&nbsp; Either one will immediately fall off upon movement though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below are 2 more pictures, for size comparison, of other recent LEGO city sets that focus on farm machinery and the like.&nbsp; <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60287-1/Tractor"">#60287</a> Tractor (just to the right from 2021), <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40423-1/Halloween-Hayride"">#40423</a>, small lawn tractor from the Halloween Hayride (far left - 2020), <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60223-1/Harvester-Transport"">#60223</a> the Combine from the Harvester Transport&nbsp;(left side - 2019) and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60181-1/Forest-Tractor"">#60181</a>, Forest Tractor (far right - 2018).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I appreciated this entry into my growing LEGO farming play area.&nbsp; Definitely at a good price point for what it delivers.&nbsp; It&#39;s a little bigger than comparable system tractors, but not so much that it seems ridiculous, and you wouldn&#39;t want it mixed in with those (in my opinion).&nbsp; A solid 4/5 in all aspects of the set!</p>
