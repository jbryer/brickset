"The_Reviewer","2011-04-05T19:23:05.43Z","Actually Pretty Good","I got this game To fill in a buy 2 get 1 free deal and I thought this game would be kinda boring, but it turned out to be very good after all. In the game you start out whith easy levels, and when you complete them you get to advance to a harder and longer version of those levels, and in the game you play as peppper, and your trying to get the role as the stuntman in the island extreme stunts movie. The graphics are&nbsp;pretty decent for 2002 and there is a secret level at the end, but I've never can figure&nbsp;out how to unlock it. and&nbsp;you also have get&nbsp;certain number of&nbsp;scores (Such as Gold/Silver/Bronze,) To&nbsp;advance&nbsp;on in the game.But believe it or not&nbsp;I like this version better than the&nbsp;PC version,&nbsp; Most Gameboy game lego make stink but this is&nbsp;very decent, so if you want a&nbsp;lego gameboy game get this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for reading!&nbsp;",FALSE,5,1,1,5,5
