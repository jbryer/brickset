The trailer for the horse is nice done, you can put the horse forwards or backwards in it. The blue thing is nice to let the fig ride on it behind the horse.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The car is quite a standard built but with a clear shift towards 4x4 thanks to minimal adjustments such as the front mudguard and the large wheels. Country but modern, thanks to the nice half-glass backdoor that opens to the saddle storage room.

The trailer looks great with the open areas on the back and for the horse face, and has 4 opening pieces: the back stopper, the roof, and two low doors in the front probably for cleaning.

Thanks to the very nice look, this vehicle still fits perfectly together with the latest town sets.

As a minor gripe, a chair for the car and one for the chariot would have made this set perfect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
