<p>Where do I start?&nbsp; This was an incredible build, the largest Lego set I&#39;ve built so far.</p>

<p>I took a picture after assembling every piece to make a stop-motion video, that video can be found here:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XQFm8KsDNQ&nbsp;</p>

<p>While building, I noticed two errors with the instructions.&nbsp; The first was on page 144, step 152, sticker placement of sticker #36.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t show it symmetrical with nearby sticker #40 applied at the same step.&nbsp; This is different from&nbsp;how it appears on the box, as well as how it appears with all steps after page 162 or step 174.</p>

<p>The second error appears near the very end, page 301, step 359, there are two winged pieces used, numbered 21 and 22, stickers get applied to them, in the image it labels both pieces as number 22.&nbsp; The stickers can only go one way, so you won&rsquo;t get it wrong.</p>

<p>The tires are really disappointing, I wish they were slicks, or different sizes, or without the weird large wheel covers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s an incredible model, and I plan on hanging it on my wall vertically, alongside my GT3, Sian, and Bugatti.&nbsp;</p>

I wanted a medium-big set for a long time already, and it didn&#39;t disappoint. Unfortunately, there are many steps that you have to do twice but mirrored which became a little boring. I&#39;ve taken my time and build the car in several evenings, so it wasn&#39;t a big deal. Really love how the suspension and the driveshaft is designed and have to be put together. This set got me hooked for the next one.</p>

<p>The result, definitely an <strong>awesome</strong> <strong>model&nbsp;</strong><strong>car</strong>. But it has 2 downsides:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The car is quite heavy in the suspension and flexing of the parts together with some little force, makes the car drag on the ground.</li>
	<li>There is too much play in the steering rods, which makes the front wheels a bit wobbly and makes it hard to drive in a straight line. This makes it less &#39;playable&#39;, if you would want it...</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitely would recommend as a fun model car to build.</p>

I think the price is very reasonable considering the number of pieces the set is, that it&#39;s officially licensed by McLaren, and how great it looks. One thing I noticed about this model that I really appreciated is that the shapes are all created by rigid elements, with none of that flex axle bs that&#39;s so common on Technic models. So it actually looks substantial without that weird wire frame look.</p>

<p>I originally expected the F1 car to be 1:10 scale, but it turns out it&#39;s actually 1:8. It&#39;s huge. It&#39;s longer than the Lamborghini Sian.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a very impressive looking model, and overall I really like it a lot, but I do have a few complaints:<br />
<br />
- The biggest complaint I have is regarding the steering. The steering wheel gear and the main steering shaft gears are directly meshed, which means that when the wheels are straight the steering wheel isn&#39;t straight. They should have found a way to solve this problem either by lowering the rack one height unit and inserted a gear in between the main shaft and the steering wheel, or raising the rack one height unit and connected the steering directly to the main shaft. It looks like there should be enough space to do either if they really tried.<br />
<br />
- My second biggest complaint is that they used heavily treaded tires. It would have looked a lot better with slicks, or even the less grooved kind of sports car tires. Though the tires used on the model do have a rounder sidewall that looks more like an F1 tire, and I appreciate that they did use the blue sidewall color to mark it as a wet tire. But I think they should have taken this opportunity to revise the mold to make a slick. It shouldn&#39;t cost that much to keep the same overall shape but remove the tread. They probably would still have uses for it in the future, and I wouldn&#39;t have minded paying a little more for such a huge improvement in the end product.<br />
<br />
- Third complaint is that the orange on the stickers don&#39;t match the orange of the Lego elements. The stickers are slightly darker. It&#39;s not that noticeable from a distance, but quite noticeable close up. It&#39;s not a huge deal, but a little annoying.<br />
<br />
- Fourth complaint is that there is no transmission. I admit this one is a minor quibble, as it&#39;s mostly a display model, and it was probably wise to omit it to keep the price of the set down. But there is a gaping void under the engine of about 3 height units capable of accepting a simple maybe 2 or 3 speed transmission. But then it would be hard to fit any type of mechanism for a shifter in the tight cockpit. But it would have been cool if they found a way to do it.<br />
