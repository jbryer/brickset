<p>The minifigures are pretty cool though. You get Steve (of course), a baby pig, a chick and a new creeper.</p>

<p>There are a lot of printed tiles and the creeper is exclusive which makes this set desirable for collectors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great value and a perfect introduction for new lego minecraft fans</p>
