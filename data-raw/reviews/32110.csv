As I prefer to do with my LEGO Minecraft reviews, I like to analyze the set from the perspective of recreating the experience of the game, and will be breaking it down by its game elements.</p>

<p>This set seems to mimic part of an <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ocean_Monument"">ocean monument</a>, given the green structure and the selection of mobs. Another Lego set has been made of this structure (#21136, which I also have), but that set is based on the ocean monument from before the updates that radically changed the way oceans work. The small slice of that structure works well, as it better conveys the scale of an ocean monument more effectively than the original set. Thus, the set&#39;s best elements ...</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minifigure is a fun design, mimicking a diver with a diving helmet.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Axolotl"">axolotls </a>are adorable and a welcome addition, given they will gladly help a player attack hostile underwater mobs. The blue one is especially fantastic, given they are very rare and only have a 1 in 1,200 chance of spawning in-game. Thankfully, in this set, they have a 1 in 1 chance!</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_Guardian"">elder guardian</a> is the same design as in #21136, and given three elder guardians spawn in a monument, its inclusion is welcome.</li>
	<li>The standard <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian"">guardian</a> is also the same design as in #21136, and as they spawn more frequently in monuments, perhaps the addition of a second one could have been welcome.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Kelp"">kelp</a> that spawns around the monument has become a symbol of how much the monuments have slotted into the new ocean update, so it&#39;s nice to see it here too.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trident"">Tridents</a>! To be fair, the set includes a trident, but an extra piece is included - a fantastic additon given players often enchant two types of tridents for ocean traversal: one with Loyalty/Impaling/Channeling, and one with Riptide. This piece is fantastic and still somewhat rare in LEGO form.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is, however, one gaping flaw: ocean monuments only spawn in <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ocean#Deep_Ocean"">deep oceans</a>. These oceans do not have <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Coral_reef"">coral reefs</a>, and as such, this ocean monument is not possible in-game. To be fair, however, it is possible for a player to place coral blocks themselves near a monument, so more forgiving builders may see this monument as more of a guardian farm than a proper monument freshly-spawned. Besides this ...</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glow_Squid"">glow squid</a> is an interesting addition given they only spawn in deep underwater caves and not near ocean monuments. Though it does look good, it does not glow in the dark - a disappointing lack of play value even if it properly represents how players felt about <em>that </em>particular mob vote event.</li>
	<li>Raiding an ocean monument without a <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet"">helmet </a>enchanted with <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Respiration"">Respiration</a> or even a turtle shell is incredibly difficult, if not impossible to succeed. Some sort of headgear with extended water breathing would have been welcome. Even a <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Potion"">potion </a>would have sufficed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these issues, I would wholeheartedly recommend this set - and even in multiples for those who like Minecraft&#39;s ocean elements. Pairing this with #21164 The Coral Reef would make for an even better diorama, even so much as resolving an issue this set presents.</p>
