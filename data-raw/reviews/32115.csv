<br />
Whenever I have a spare bit of change saved up, I swing &#39;round to my local newsstand who are sure to have one of the latest issues of the Ninjago magazine. This month, I picked up the magazine with Scuba Jay.<br />
<br />
The cheapest set that Scuba Jay appears in is <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71752-1/Ninja-Sub-Speeder"">71752</a> Ninja Sub Speeder, which goes for $50, which is not a price I&#39;m willing to pay, even if it does represent good value. However, I really wanted the Jay minifigure since I think it&#39;s the best Scuba suit, tied with Zane&#39;s, so I was really happy to now own a brand-new version of him.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
Very nice square foil pack, with easy-to-open edges like a chip packet&#39;s. The border design is some classic red Ninjago patterns, with a render of Jay in action, yellow-green lightning bursting from behind him. A photograph shows him off, equipped&nbsp;with all&nbsp;his accessories<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents</strong><br />
<br />
10 pieces make up <strong>Scuba Jay</strong>, who comes with all the basic accessories of a Scuba ninja: a one-piece rubber scuba tank with rebreather, a pair of black flippers and a silver katana. Besides those, he also comes with a Lightning Harpoon,&nbsp;as advertised in the accompanying magazine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
His torso is the most well designed in my opinion - a predominantly&nbsp;dark blue&nbsp;base, blue evenly distributed across said dark blue, dark bluish gray straps, and a touch of flame yellowish&nbsp;orange accents to spice&nbsp;things up. I&#39;m a huge fan of this design.<br />
<br />
No instructions come with this foil pack, which is usual, but none are really required for only a minifigure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
<br />
I really enjoy a cheap way to obtain Scuba Jay, so this foil pack is perfect for me. I&#39;m hoping to obtain Benthomaar, Glutinous and Scuba Nya, all of which are confirmed to&nbsp;be featured in future issues of the Ninjago magazine<br />
