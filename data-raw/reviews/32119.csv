<p>When I saw this one at a nice discount, I didn&#39;t think twice and picked one up.</p>

<p>Now, about the car: yeah, it is a nice looking car. It is sleek, smooth, funky. BUT, when comparing it to the source material, it is obvious this is NOT a Lotus Evija. There is simply too much wrong with the shaping.</p>

<p>This set therefor is the&nbsp;perfect example of where this entire theme fall flat most of the time: the LEGO-cars have a difficulty resembling the actual car. It simply is too hard to do in this scale.</p>

<p>Is that a problem? Well, not if you like nice looking LEGO-cars and interesting building methods. And this model has a fair share of those: upside down, technic, ball-joint connections...it is a real treat!</p>

<p>And maybe that is all it has to be: a nice build, a nice looking car, a fun cheap LEGO set.</p>

For most of this set, he built it himself, but then midway through he got stuck. For him, some of the parts and where they fit can be a tad confusing, but in any case, he&#39;s learning.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What I liked about it:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>- Cool car</p>

<p>- The car is playable and the base is sturdy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What I didn&#39;t like about it:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>- Some pieces are very similar and you could easily have used it in the wrong place. You needed to be very careful and precise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that I liked this set. Definitely a cool car. Good building experience with my son.&nbsp;</p>

"REGINALDO","2023-04-07T23:14:55.12Z","76907 LOTUS EVIJA","<p>I&#39;m a fan of racing cars, when I was younger I was a collector of miniature cars, then I saw this &#39;Lego Speed Champion&#39; line, I bought this set to see the construction and other details. On the look of the set&#39;s packaging, it appears as a good replica. So I can make my comments:<br />
1. Minifigure<br />
I loved the details, they could put some details on the helmet, it would look better. Replacing the wrench with a trophy (suggestion), this is an idea for me to add to my collection.<br />
2. Reference<br />
It&#39;s really hard for a lego to replicate the curves of these speed champion cars or get close to the details. For me, Lego was daring, and I believe that every day it can improve details and curves, with special pieces, it would be necessary to create other pieces, which is interesting for Lego to innovate, but what can set the production of this line (sets).<br />
3. The Completed Model<br />
I bought this set 76907 because I like motor sport, I&#39;m a collector of miniature racing cars, I love collecting.<br />
I agree, with a comment made by someone on this comments page, the construction of this set for a child is complex, depending on the age even more, it has many minutiae, stickers, parts that can be confused with the colour and other things. However, I see it as an opportunity for parents to participate and monitor the construction of their children.<br />
For Lego to reach the definitions of the curves and details of the cars, it needs investment in new special parts. I have no doubt about it, that every day Lego is improving, changing the adhesive headlights for appropriate parts. And you can build your car and increase your fun.<br />
In my view it is an innovation and every day they improve with our suggestions and opinions. On the other hand, it is fun, cognition and investment.<br />
For me, building LEGO is therapy. Combining Lego with a collection of high-speed miniature cars is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Summary:<br />
- The colour turned out great!<br />
- Some details of curves with the pieces that Lego makes available turned out great.<br />
- It has a construction that requires attention, in the case of children, parental supervision, it has parts that can be interchanged and incorrectly attached, hence attention when assembling and adhesive.<br />
- The capot lacked a better finish, there was a hole.</p>

<p>Maximum score for this set. Congratulations LEGO</p>

The angles of the pieces are a big part of the sets because they are different angles touching next to each other. The only downside of this set was a lot of stickers. I do not know the exact amount, but I remember a lot was used. Overall, it&nbsp;was a good set and I would cop one before they go off the shelves.</p>
