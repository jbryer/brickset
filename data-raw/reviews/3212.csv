The first floor interior is a bit lacking, with an extremely simple table but an otherwise really nice-looking table lamp. This floor only has one window and the door, it could have been better if it had a second window on the side.

Despite the small size, there is a second floor, with a simple bed (looks odd, this must be a house from the '70s), a cupboard and a window on the roof.

The outside garden is as small as it gets, but has enough for its size: a fireplace which is half-built into the wall, a garden table with chairs, and some flowers.

Two great finishing touches are the outdoor lamp and the chimney.

If it wasn't for the lack of shutters on the windows and the limited furniture inside, and if it had a somewhat more compelling color scheme, it would be really perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the red roof and the yellow wall, but looks like a McDonalds without the white door and the McDonalds logos. I'm not saying it's bad, but it looks alot like one. Besides that, this looks excellent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
