<p>A good image of the Lambo. Especially in the back.</p>

<p>The turn indicators made up of a sticker and a see-through element over it in the front are a brilliant idea (see gallery).</p>

<p>The minifig&#39;s head has two faces - only one of them is grinning, I don&#39;t see why the non-grinning one is even included in a Lamborghini set.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a gear stick inside, which is a nice detail.</p>

<p>The model is a pleasure to build, and can be built by a 5-year old with minimal assistance (stickers are easily spoiled)</p>

<p>Now for the things I didn&#39;t like:</p>

<p>- nowhere to store the wrench and hair (passenger&#39;s seat is there, but you can&#39;t attach them in any way)</p>

<p>- some elements depend on various kinds of hinging to be at the right angle and may move during play</p>

<p>- the rims are printed instead of three-dimensonal elements&nbsp;</p>

<p>- the canopy does not fully close when the driver sits upright in the helmet (see gallery) but it&#39;s ok if he leans back. Maybe you always lean back when driving a Lambo, with all the accelaration</p>

<p>- the driver does not sit right in front of the wheel (see gallery)</p>

"ForestMenOfEndor","2022-04-11T19:12:31.327Z","A remarkable model of an iconic car, but not without its minor flaws","<p>First things first, this is my favourite Speed Champions vehicle, yet, and one that I was greatly anticipating. I grew up in the 1980s, and while I always preferred the gentler lines of the Porsche 911, the Countach was easily the sharpest looking sports car on the scene (sorry, Ferrari). This 8-wide rendition does the original justice, looks great on the shelf and is super fun to vroom around the room with my 4-year-old son.</p>

<p>We own 7 of the old 6-wide Speed Champions cars, and while they will always have a place on the streets of our LEGO city, the 3 newer 8-wide models that we have are vastly superior. As others have noted, they have evolved from somewhat basic toys to (still playable) scale replicas. As mentioned above, the 911 is my &quot;favourite&quot; (seriously, the checker won&#39;t let me spell this correctly?) sports car, but the 8-wide Countach is so much better than its 6-wide 911 cousin as to not be in the same competition. For example, the scale has allowed the SC designers to use building techniques that rival anything in the Creator Expert/Modular Buildings series. The technique that is used to create the bodywork behind this Countach&#39;s cockpit is amazing.</p>

<p>But it also creates a weird protrusion on either side that bothers me from a head-on view, and that is one of only two complaints that I have with 76908. The other is with its overall scale/accuracy - namely, that it is too long. Using the 8-stud width as a starting point, the real Countach was just under 80 inches wide, meaning that each stud scales to just about 10 inches. 76908 is approximately 19 studs long, which means that it should equate to a real life vehicle that measured nearly 190 inches. But the Countach was about 162 inches long, with a 96-inch wheelbase. So an accurate model would be 16-17 studs long with a 10-stud wheelbase (rather than the 11-stud wheelbase on 76908). Now, all of that being said, I am not a Speed Champions designer and have not tried to improve upon this model by shortening it, and that may just not be possible. So for what it is, 76908 approaches perfection (I dinged it in the &quot;Parts&quot; category because of the awful cockpit printing/color&nbsp;matching).</p>

<p>In conclusion, I enjoyed building it, it looks great, and it makes for a fun toy. It has a nice PPP, if that&#39;s your thing, and absolutely feels like it&#39;s worth the $20 RRP. Oh yeah, it has a minifgure too, which is always great for the minifig bin. I give 76908 Lamborghini Countach five stars and a solid score of 93/100. Cheers!</p>

"VictorJiangKiangLiangMiang","2023-01-31T07:38:20.76Z","An excellent build, somewhat marred by inconsistent canopy colour matching","<p>Amongst the Speed Champion cars in 2022, arguably the most popular ones is 76908, which depicts the unmistakable Lamborghini Countach. Produced between 1982&nbsp;and 1985, the Countach <a href=""https://www.lambocars.com/countach-lp500-s/"">LP500S</a>&nbsp;is reproduced in this Lego model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firstly, the&nbsp;broadly accurate shape is worthy of approbation, being smooth with few studs and commendable curvatures. The model looks appealing from the side (notwithstanding the absence of doors, though inevitably this would exigent to achieve in this scale)&nbsp;and from the back, of which the bonnet design and wing are desirable features.&nbsp;Viewed from the front, it is laudable that the headlight has&nbsp;brick-built elements. Also commendable in my opinion is that the set merely contains 13 stickers, which, while not exceptionally few, is significantly fewer compared to the liberal sticker use observed in other Speed Champions sets.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a major blemish is immediately conspicuous upon looking from the front-the canopy. While accurate in shape from my perspective, the colour matching is egregious, similarly to the&nbsp;consistently problematic canopy printings&nbsp;in Speed Champion sets, which to me is&nbsp;blatantly unacceptable. However, this instance- potentially due to the white colour of the car- is especially noticeable to me.</p>

<p>Removing the cockpit reveals a decent interior&nbsp;with red leather, which is decently detailed IMO compared to other Speed Champions sets. The set is equipped with a single Minifigure, with relatively mundane legs, helmet, and torso design.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;playability of #76908 is additionally excellent, Its value&nbsp;for 262 pieces (retailing $20 USD, $20 pounds, and $33 AUD where I live) renders an exceptional price to part ratio. Of course,&nbsp; the volume of stuff is more critical, yet-despite that numerous parts are quite small-in my opinion the volume here is&nbsp;definitely sufficient. As such, the price seems to be absolutely reasonable. Hence, this set has commendable shaping and details, is a decent build experience, and offers serviceable playability at a suitable price. The canopy unfortunately blemish the set, still overall this is commendable and still receives&nbsp;3 1/2 stars from me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading the review.</p>

"RTS013","2022-06-08T13:53:14.42Z","Perfection, or misleading box art?","<p>The Lamborghini Countach is a truly&nbsp;iconic vehicle&nbsp;with its unique 70s styling,&nbsp;you just have to appreciate it, at least to some degree. And, this&nbsp;LEGO rendition&nbsp;is fascinating with pieces mounted at all sorts of angles to capture that look. Pictures of this set really caught my attention.&nbsp;The way the front was shaped, and the back, with those&nbsp;brick-built head- and rear lights in particular. Is it as good in person?</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Putting it together is actually quite straight-forward. It&#39;s really intricately designed, like all Speed Champions sets, but easy to assemble. As you&nbsp;have probably noticed, the air intakes above the rear fenders are attached in an unconventional way. But more surprising the front splitter assembly is not as straight-forward as it seems.&nbsp;It&#39;s attached &quot;off-stud&quot; so to speak, very cleverly, to get it at just the right distance away from the front tyres. It all comes together satisfyingly, but it finishes kind of abruptly, and suddenly you are all done.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With the angular styling of the Countach the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6385624/windscreen-6x6x1-1-3-no-9"">windscreen/canopy piece</a> commonly used in Speed Champions sets finally has its good use! I usually find it too sharp-edged for the shapes it&#39;s trying to replicate on more modern cars. Here it&#39;s just great!&nbsp;But the printing, though. Not so good. It&#39;s a good design as such, but the colour is clearly way off from the white plastic that makes the rest of the bodywork. It looks rather&nbsp;like some form of light-blueish-grey than white. It&#39;s such a shame on an otherwise exquisite model. LEGO have shown previously that they are&nbsp;able to do better. This set deserve better.</p>

<p>Another small annoyance&nbsp;I encountered is a classic with clear-backed stickers, which is being used for this set. I was really careful to clean all surfaces, but somewhere between lifting one of the stickers from the sheet and applying it to the model the adhesive still picked up a small piece of dust from the air, which is now sealed-in underneath the sticker on the model. Since the background plastic is white, it has maximum contrast, so I keep noticing it. Oh, well, my bad. Be aware if you care about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>The wheels are using <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6376730/flat-tile-2x2-round-no-1230"">printed round tiles</a> to good effect, with good quality.&nbsp;Although they do look a bit flat, especially if you know how deep the rear ones are on the real car.</p>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>For the small size of this&nbsp;set,&nbsp;it&#39;s&nbsp;a remarkably accurate scale replica&nbsp;of the real vehicle. It&#39;s 154mm long, 72mm wide, 43mm tall, and has a 88mm wheelbase. The real Countach is 4140mm long, 1887mm wide, 1070mm tall, and has a 2450mm wheelbase. I crunched those numbers and the&nbsp;resulting&nbsp;scales varies between about 1:25&nbsp;and 1:27, so let&#39;s call it 1:26&nbsp;on average.&nbsp;A perfect model at that scale would have been 159mm long, 73mm wide, 41mm tall, and with a 94mm wheelbase. In other words, comfortably less than&nbsp;a stud (which is 8mm) off for each dimension. I&#39;d say that&#39;s about as good as can be expected!</p>

<p>A friend of mine, who&#39;s not really into LEGO and only somewhat interested in cars, immediately recognised it as a Lamborghini on my desk. That, I&nbsp;think, is a very positive nod to the design&nbsp;of this set!</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This, like most cars of this scale, I would say is very swooshable. It rolls very nicely on hard surfaces and can accommodate two minifigs. Speaking of which, <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sc095/lamborghini-countach-driver"">the one included</a>&nbsp;is a bit underwhelming, even when only compared to other sets in the Speed Champions line. The only printing is found on the front and back of the torso. Legs are plain dark blue. It does include both a helmet and a hairpiece though, which I really appreciate.</p>

<p>Those angled subassemblies above the rear wheels tend to get misaligned easily when grabbing the car with your hands. But, they are just as easy to push back down, and they don&#39;t tend to fall off. Still wish they would snap into position and just stay there though.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Overall the Lamborghini Countach is one of the best in&nbsp;a great theme. It has its flaws,&nbsp;but if you like what you see on the box&nbsp;this one does not disappoint. Apart from the print on that canopy, though, which is definitely not as well colour-matched as shown.</p>
