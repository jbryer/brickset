"MarvelousMrB","2022-04-26T09:32:20.38Z","A nice set but there is something lacking. ","<p>I finally bought myself the 76909-1 Lego Mercedes Speed Champions sets. I LOVE the Speed Champions sets just for the record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions for the F1 care are straight forward as are the ones for Mercedes AMG Project One car. The colours are good as are the stickers of which you could add either the Hamilton or Bottas livery to your F1 car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, having built both, there is something lacking with the F1 car. I don&#39;t know what exactly, but it is there. I built the Jaguar Formula E car from the 2019 Speed Champions set and immediately loved that. But, not this one it felt blocky and devoid of any character which is a shame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Project One care on the other hand is a really nice build and is on par with the Lamborghini and the current 2022 sets which I absolutely love.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will still make a great addition to a Speed Champions collection. But, it lacks something and I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it.&nbsp;</p>
