"PerryThePlatypus","2022-08-19T13:58:29.317Z","So, we meet again Buzz Lightyear, FOR THE LAST TIME!","<p>Lightyear was the movie I was most hyped for this year. While I enjoyed the movie, it wasn&rsquo;t quite what I was hoping it would be and it fell short of expectations. Nevertheless, the Lego sets made for the movie were excellent and covers the film pretty well in my opinion. Furthermore, Zurg Battle seemed very appealing for its inclusion of 5 different characters!</p>

<h3>The Build&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Zurg: </b>Zurg underwent a couple changes in Lightyear, most notably, he is now a giant robot mech which deviates quite a bit from its original Toy Story counterpart. I liked the overall redesign and his translation to Lego turned out pretty awesome. No corners were cut in the design of the build, and it looks good from any angle, including the back, which is well-finished and has 3 stickers on it! Speaking of stickers, Zurg is covered with a total of 15 stickers, which is a bit excessive but does make the model look detailed. The posability here is great and satisfying, both the arms and legs feature great articulation, though the use of clip joints instead of ball joints for the knees was a bit odd, given that ball joints would&rsquo;ve allowed for a stronger connection AND a greater range of movement. But either way, it&rsquo;s not a big deal and the presence of knee joints is appreciated. 2 other important things to point out is the excellent new specialized head piece which can rotate 360 degrees and the printed teleportation disc attached at the waist, which also appears in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76830-1/Zyclops-Chase"">Zyclops Chase</a>. Lastly, I&rsquo;d like to point out my 2 bits of criticism regarding the model. The hands with the skinny fingers look decent but unfortunately can&rsquo;t grab onto anything, not even something like the crystallic Fusion. And second, the disappointing lack of Zurg&rsquo;s iconic blaster cannon. In the movie, we see the cannon is integrated as part of the arm, so I wish a separate sub-assembly was provided to have the option to swap out the hand, much like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70904-1/Clayface-Splat-Attack"">Clayface Splat Attack</a>. Overall, this is a near perfect representation of the on-screen character. My minor gripes with it don&rsquo;t detract from its great aspects, like the menacing design, the color scheme and posability.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Buzz Lightyear:</b> I have collected all the previous iterations of Buzz Lightyear minifigures from over the years and adding a new one to the collection was exciting. This version of Buzz varies from his toy counterpart through more intricate and complex detail and the use of a new element for his distinctive armor. The torso and leg prints are extremely detailed and satisfying, and I&rsquo;m very pleased with the inclusion of arm printing, with the Star Command logo on the left arm and Buzz&rsquo;s wrist laser blaster on the right arm which is a unique print to this particular figure! The new armor features 2 studs at the back where you can attach Buzz&rsquo;s Jetpack wings, which was unfortunately printed on the backside only, but hey, the print looks stunning. Interestingly, there appears to be attachment holes in the armor, but they can&rsquo;t exactly accommodate the old visor element, whose omission in the Lightyear wave is strange. The head with the lavender balaclava is exclusive to the set and I like the confident expression. As an awesome bonus, an extra head and hair was provided to have an unmasked Buzz, the face prints look good, but the use of the spiky hair piece doesn&rsquo;t look quite right, perhaps a new element was necessary. Finally, his accessories include an overwatch gun in white and a trans-red antenna attached to a clear holder to simulate the emission of a laser. Overall, the hair choice doesn&rsquo;t quite work and the fact that the old visor piece was omitted and incompatible with the new armor is a shame, but otherwise a fantastic and highly collectible figure. It doesn&rsquo;t beat the 2016 CMF version, but it&#39;s probably one of my favorite figures of 2022!</p>

<p><b>Izzy Hawthorne:</b> Izzy&rsquo;s Star Command suit is practically identical to Buzz&rsquo;s, except for a different print on the right arm which also appears in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76830-1/Zyclops-Chase"">Zyclops Chase</a>. The head with the balaclava here is exclusive to the set and just like Buzz, could be swapped out for an unmasked head and hair. I like the cheerful and confident expressions,&nbsp;and the Bumblebee hair is used here, which is inaccurate&nbsp;and should&rsquo;ve used a new piece, however,&nbsp;it may not have fit with the armor, so I can kinda let it slide. Lastly, her accessories include the new stud shooter gun and the crystallic fusion which is a nifty little build that uses a printed 1x1 brick for the crystal. Overall, Izzy kinda suffers the same 2 issues as Buzz, but is still a fantastic and well-detailed figure nonetheless.</p>

<p><b>Sox:</b> Buzz&rsquo;s lovable robot companion is represented by the existing cat piece. I think its usage is acceptable and the printing on it is good, though the eyes should&rsquo;ve been enlarged to bear more resemblance to the character and better convey the fact that it&rsquo;s a robot. Nevertheless, Sox still looks adorable, and I&rsquo;m satisfied with how he came out, it&rsquo;s also nice to have him in this cheaper set as he only other comes in the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76832-1/XL-15-Spaceship"">&nbsp;XL-15 Spaceship</a>.</p>

<p><b>E.R.I.C:</b> I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why E.R.I.C the robot was considered important enough to be included here given their almost nonexistent role in the movie, but hey, the more the merrier! I was surprised by how interesting and clever of a build it turned out to be. Its design looks so great and unique, it gives me Dalek vibes,&nbsp;&nbsp;and I love how it&rsquo;s actually built upside down. The only downside is the use of 3 stickers on this, some prints would&rsquo;ve been nice. But otherwise, a fantastic robot build that really goes above and beyond, build and design wise.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>R540 for this is a bit much. The build for Zurg came out smaller than I expected, which I see as a good thing as it scales better to the minifigs. But on the other hand, given its relatively modest size (especially when compared to<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76128-1/Molten-Man-Battle"">&nbsp;Molten Man Battle&nbsp;</a>which retailed for about the same price), it looks better suited priced between R350 to R400. All in all, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel too bad paying full price for this, but it&rsquo;s definitely a bit overpriced.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s just the little things here and there that could&rsquo;ve been slightly improved whether it be for the main build or the figures. In spite of its minor issues though, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the final product. It&rsquo;s an overall really fun set that nailed the design of Zurg and has fantastic exclusive figures. It&rsquo;s also kind of a glorified character pack of a set, giving you 5 unique ones, and I love that. So if you&rsquo;re a Pixar fan or enjoyed the Lightyear movie, this is a nice one to pick up, when discounted of course.</p>
