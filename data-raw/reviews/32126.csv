"Bowtie_Bricks","2022-05-17T15:49:23.82Z","A UCS Level set, at a Fraction of the Cost!","<p>The XL-15 Spaceship is one of my favourite sets I&#39;ve built in a while. From the images, it seems to be a relatively simple build; however, it is deceitfully complicated, making for a fun, complex, build that takes you on a journey to infinity... and beyond!</p>

<p>To man the spacecraft, LEGO gives the main Buzz Lightyear. Besides his helmet and protected&nbsp;head, his normal face and hair are also given, which were not necessary but a welcome inclusion. Also included are 2 new enemies, whom I don&#39;t know about, as the film is yet to be released and the trailers give very little insight. However, both do include&nbsp;useful armour pieces, new face prints on slightly uncommon skin tones, and new exclusive helmet moulds.</p>

<p>The build for the XL-15 Spaceship starts off like most, with a sturdy base. From this sturdy base, the cockpit and rear engines begin to form. One of the great things about this base is how playable the model is; I personally have taken it on many &quot;missions&quot; (Swooshing it around the room and making engine noises), and have had no problems with any sort of loose pieces, broken wings, etc. The designers definitely had their intentions when planning this set.</p>

<p>The cockpit has enough room to fit Buzz in, without loosing his armour or helmet. Additionally, his cat companion can squeeze in behind. This works well, leaving the 2 cargo holds in the back to carry his unidentified accessory, computer, and spare accessories. One cargo hold is deeper and opens from the top, allowing for the spare head and Buzz&#39;s blaster to fit in, if you can finesse it properly. The second cargo space is directly underneath that, opening from the back between the two engines, perfect for holding his unidentified crystal assembly.</p>

<p>The wings may not look complex, but the system that holds them at the precise angle is ingenious, using part&nbsp;6256117. The angles for spot between the wings and the main body also use some clever part usage, as it manages to cover up the brightly coloured parts beneath. The engines are held in firmly, and blend into the ship perfectly.</p>

<p>Overall, the ship is a challenging build that looks beautiful on display, and looks even better with the included stand. But I would recommend taking the ship on adventures around your LEGO displays, as it was designed to go to infinty... and beyond!</p>

"ET","2022-06-26T04:22:42.62Z","Solid set, one of the best","<p>I mainly stick to Star Wars but was intrigued by this set and bought it soon after its release. The build is impressive, the ship looks excellent on display and the display stand makes it dynamic and easy to pose. No pieces fall off of it and it has great <em>swoosh</em> factor. I don&#39;t know who the minifigures are, but they look pretty cool too. Could have been a little cheaper but that is a common theme with all Lego.</p>

<p>Overall one of the best sets I&#39;ve purchased.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2022-11-12T11:56:03.307Z","A set that goes to Infinity and Beyond ","<p>Lightyear as a film was a bit of a letdown. I didn&rsquo;t necessarily dislike it but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t what I was hoping it&rsquo;d be. Fortunately though, it allowed a surprisingly great Lego theme to spawn from it, and if we&rsquo;re being honest, the sets are better than the actual movie&hellip; which is&hellip; a bit sad. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve heard great things about the XL-15 from reviews, so my expectations were set pretty high, needless to say, this set beyond exceeded them.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><b>The XL-15:</b> So first and foremost, this thing looks magnificent. I can spend a while just marvelling it. You can tell just how much passion and effort was put into the model. No corners were cut in the build, the vessel&rsquo;s angular design was captured flawlessly, the build experience was engaging, and the level of detail is exceptional. Starting with the cockpit, it&rsquo;s surprisingly spacious despite being able to hold only one minifigure, Buzz can fit comfortably even with the bulky armor and there&rsquo;s enough space to seat Sox behind him as well! There are 2 stickered control panels, a joystick control and a printed triangular tile representing I.V.A.N, the navigational system. The canopy itself is brand new and specialized for this ship, it looks fantastic and much sleeker than the X-Wing canopy, can&rsquo;t wait to see future uses for this piece. The back engine and wing area was the most satisfying part of the build experience, employing various clever techniques and strategies with an extremely well-finished result. In between the 2 very interesting engine elements I haven&rsquo;t seen before, is a compartment area where you can store the Crystallic Fusion and Buzz&rsquo;s accessories, which is just a great use of space. It&rsquo;s easy to why this ship warrants a display stand and as such one was provided here, featuring a stickered plaque similar to those found in UCS sets, further reinforcing the UCS level of sophistication and quality that this model possesses. Overall, this build blew me away, everything about it was done so right. The design and shaping is unique and fantastic, its swooshability is just as splendid as its displayability, the detail is impeccable, just an all around flawless model.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Captain Lightyear:</b> Buzz sports an orange flight suit here, reminiscent of the X-Wing pilots. The details on display is great and deviating from the X-wing pilots, a bulky gray armor is worn, the piece itself is a recolor of the space ranger armor used in the other sets, I like it, it really helps make Buzz as a spaceship pilot look unique. Buzz wears a medium blue balaclava, differing from the lavender head from Zurg Battle, and displays a confident expression. The Balaclava head could be swapped out for a regular set of head and hair, the confident and smile expressions look good but the spiky hair piece doesn&rsquo;t quite look right, ideally, there should&rsquo;ve been a new hair element for Buzz, but I appreciate the inclusion nonetheless. A helmet with visor is included and finally, his accessories are a white overwatch gun and a laptop with a sticker displaying information about the crystallic fusion. Overall, this is a great and detailed exclusive variant of the character, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it.</p>

<p><b>Sox:</b> Buzz&rsquo;s lovable robot companion is represented by the existing cat piece. I think its usage is acceptable and the printing on it is good, though the eyes should&rsquo;ve been enlarged to bear more resemblance to the character and better convey Sox&rsquo;s robotic nature. Nevertheless, Sox still looks adorable, could&rsquo;ve been slightly improved, but I&rsquo;m still satisfied with how he came out.</p>

<p><b>Darby Steel:</b> 2 members of the Junior Zap Patrol accompany Buzz in this set, the first of which is Darby. The detailing is fantastic, featuring flame yellowish orange stripes on the legs and various pouches on the torso. The Star Wars heavy chest/shoulder armor is used here to great effect, I love the dark green color and the scratch mark details on it, there&rsquo;s an orange splotch on the left shoulder as well. The face prints under the helmet display a smirk and a scowl. Speaking of the helmet, it&rsquo;s a new mold made for the theme, it has such an interesting shape and somewhat sinister look to it, I love the red eyes and just the whole helmet in general. The helmet could be swapped out for the gray hair with a bun. Lastly, Steel&rsquo;s weapon is a built up rocket launcher, integrating a stud shooter and even using a sticker, it&rsquo;s always great to see built up weapons. Overall, the figure should&rsquo;ve used mid-legs and the hair choice doesn&rsquo;t work but I honestly don&rsquo;t mind the inaccuracies, it&rsquo;s a highly detailed and unique figure, and it&rsquo;s perfect the way it is in my eyes.</p>

<p><b>Mo Morrison:</b> Mo is the other junior zap patrol member and the figure is identical to Darby, minus the unique armor and of course, the head. Sand blue is not a new color for the chest/shoulder armor piece but the print is exclusive, once again, I love the detail and scratch marks on it and there&rsquo;s a medium azure splotch on the right shoulder. Mo has a chipper face and he uses the T&rsquo;challa Star-Lord hair, a bit disappointing he doesn&rsquo;t come with an alternate face but I don&rsquo;t mind too much. Finally, Morrison comes with a yellow built up harpoon that kinda looks like a flamethrower. Overall, a beautifully detailed figure with appealing and unique elements that can easily be used in settings outside of Lightyear.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>R900 for this feels pretty good. Usually the premium price with this amount of stuff wouldn&rsquo;t feel sufficient to me, however, much like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76200-1/Bro-Thor-s-New-Asgard"">Bro&nbsp;Thor</a>, the sheer premium feel and quality of the set really helps to bolster the value and make it feel justified.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion &nbsp;</h3>

<p>The XL-15 absolutely earns its spot as one of the best Lego spaceships ever made. It&rsquo;s astounding the amount of detail and ingenious building techniques that were achieved at this size and scale, much like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76193-1/The-Guardians-Ship"">The&nbsp;Guardians&nbsp;Ship</a>, it really feels like a UCS set that just happened to be scaled down. The included display stand is much appreciated (more display stand in smaller sets please!) and the minifigures are stellar as well. So overall, I cannot recommend this set enough, you don&rsquo;t even have to be a fan of the source material to like it. If you like sci-fi, spaceships or just great display models, the XL-15 absolutely warrants strong consideration.</p>
