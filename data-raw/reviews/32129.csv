<p>It took me quite a few hours each of 3 days to put the set together.&nbsp; This includes converting it into all 3 film version modes, as there are directions to allow you to choose which version you wish to display.&nbsp; Those modifications come at the very end of construction and happen in the last set of bags, marked 11.&nbsp; (there are 2 of those bags).&nbsp; I am more deliberate and slow to build with sets like these, just so I can enjoy them more as I assemble the models.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed building this set as it was a LOT more challenging than what I was expecting, truly.&nbsp; It almost boiled into borderline frustration with 1 or 2 aspects of the build, which was unusual.&nbsp; I expect that from a complex technic set, but was surprised that this particular model almost caused frustration.&nbsp; But, that&#39;s really not a complaint - in fact, I was really pleased how fun of a challenge it was.&nbsp; I missed a step when I was building one of the back panels from &quot;memory&quot; and ended up with a spare part at the end of that sub-build.&nbsp; That ended up being a real chore to un-do, as it was difficult to carefully remove parts to fix my error.&nbsp; But that was a ME problem.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Excellent details everywhere on the car.&nbsp; Gull wing doors opening, colors, shape of Delorean, including its low profile and new windscreen.&nbsp; The mechanical elements to portray the different engines or &quot;time travel&quot; gizmos located all over the car are really great.&nbsp; Such a level of detail shown is top notch.&nbsp; Including the &quot;energy/lightning&quot; aspect around the front bonnet and along the back, where the energy is drawn into the capacitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I love that you can turn it into any of the versions seen from all 3 movies!&nbsp; (more on that later)</li>
	<li>Light up brick ingenuously used to create the flux capacitor.</li>
	<li>Use of stickers was minimal, but very effective, from creating the 3 dates on the front panel, to the Mr Fusion label.</li>
	<li>Unique and clever ability to flip the 4 wheels simultaneously to go from drivable to &quot;flyable&quot; by simply moving a technic built lever hidden underneath the chassis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Front hood sits very flush and when opened, contains plenty of room for the hover board and box of plutonium.</li>
	<li>Very pleased it came with 2 mini-figures of Doc and Marty!&nbsp; Still wish they would have at least done that with the Aston Martin DB5/James Bond vehicle!</li>
	<li>Very similar size to other model cars from the past few years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Doors do not necessarily stay open.... one of mine does for a bit, the other will fall closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Its kind of difficult to actually open the front bonnet, definitely need some fingernails to raise that up.</li>
	<li>This is a nit-pick, but it still bugs me.&nbsp; LEGO provides all of the necessary pieces in order to convert the car into all 3 movie versions..... a few of them have to be re-used when doing the conversion.&nbsp; Had they provided, like 5 extra (duplicate?) pieces, then you could quickly revert the car to any of the 3 versions you like, without having to deconstruct certain elements, like the Mr Fusion reactor or normal machinery from the original version.&nbsp; I&#39;m totally fine with them not providing 8 sets of rubber wheels - that&#39;s asking too much and its not bad to convert one set of rims for another.</li>
	<li>In order to change the back license plate, well - I honestly am not even sure how to do so.&nbsp; The way that whole console clips into the body - I haven&#39;t taken that apart.&nbsp; The issue here is that the sticker for the license plate is on a window piece.&nbsp; Those don&#39;t come out easily.&nbsp; I highly suggest you pick the one you like the most and leave it as is!</li>
	<li>There are a couple spots where they use a piece color that does NOT blend into where it should at all.&nbsp; On the interior of the car and along some of the technic underwork, by the wheel wells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>My only other quibble - is that when push driving the car around, I will occasionally have a wheel come right out of the socket.&nbsp; I probably didn&#39;t snap them in decent enough when I was trading rims.</p>

<p>My cons list is me being really picky about this model.&nbsp; Overall, I totally love how this turned out and it was very much worth getting right away.&nbsp; High marks for this rendition of the BTTF DeLorean.</p>

<p>With this attempt they&#39;ve, obviously, gone bigger and added accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does it work? Yes. It does. And very well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It now looks like a Lego Delorean should and the minifigures have been improved too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a build it&#39;s actually really fun and the added bonus of choosing which version to build really works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it worth buying ?</p>

<p>For a BTTF fan. Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a Lego fan. Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a car fan. Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For anyone. Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Delorean time machine is an iconic car and film prop.&nbsp; This is a worthy addition to anyone&#39;s collection.&nbsp;</p>
