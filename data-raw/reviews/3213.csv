A nice crate is included that can also be used with trains or boats. The vehicle has extendable legs for extra stability and last but not least a nice minifig. I'm proud to own this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

i also recommend 6352!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jon11380","2008-01-14T06:34:38.56Z","Top town set","This set is a brilliant example of classic lege.  No juniorized parts at all.  A very functional, and playably model is produced.  Jacks raise/ lower, jib tuns, extends and raises and lowers.  What more can you ask from a crane truck.  Looks relatively realistic too, despite there being few curved parts in mid 80's.

I wrecked original example many years ago and regret it so much so i have ordered all parts from bricklink to do a rebuild!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Heisenberg","2017-11-08T21:17:54.573Z","My Yellow Crane","<p>This was a set I had as a child and have&nbsp;fond memories of.&nbsp;My original was well played with and disappeared long ago into the Lego box. &nbsp;I have recently acquired another and will try to be a little bit subjective.</p>

<h3><b>Packaging</b></h3>

<p>This is really quite good. It looks like a standard box but is actually a cardboard container that slides out of its sleeve. &nbsp;This way the box is not damaged and can be reused.</p>

<p>Classic Legoland&nbsp;design. No set name as picture is all you need. &nbsp;Alternative builds on the back.</p>

<p>If only Lego still made boxes like this...</p>

<h3><b>Build and Parts</b></h3>

<p>This is a small set by today&#39;s standard but a medium set back then. &nbsp;Instructions are a single folded sheet. More rewarding to build as you have to really keep an eye on the changes.</p>

<p>Notable parts are the telescopic crane, the&nbsp;handle winch and a metal crane hook. &nbsp;Yes a metal Lego piece. &nbsp;This seems to have been needed as a plastic one would not have been heavy enough to work.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>Classic Lego man in black dungarees and hard hat. &nbsp;Smiley face and not much more to say except he&#39;s&nbsp;a good guy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Finished model and playability</strong></h3>

<p>Great looking crane. Simple but classic. &nbsp;There is a place to store the container,&nbsp;the crane folds up neatly and the supports can be stacked and stored.</p>

<p>Loads of fun doing crane related tasks. &nbsp;The container is hollow with shuttered windows used as doors and can be used for all kinds of cargo.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall</strong></h3>

<p>Unfortunately the parts in this&nbsp;model are quite prone to breaking which is what happened to my original childhood set. &nbsp;The way the clips are used in the build means they will break through normal play. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think this would pass Lego quality control today.</p>

<p>However it&#39;s a classic and I had great joy building it although I would say a lot&nbsp;of that joy was nostalgia.</p>

<p>But is&nbsp;there a place for an old&nbsp;yellow crane in a modern Lego town?</p>

<p>There is for me.</p>

"MrMajestical","2019-10-17T04:52:05.953Z","6361 Mobile Crane","<p>This is a set I had back in the mid-80&#39;s, and one I remember fondly. Although that set is long gone, I did find and buy a very nice example recently.</p>

<p>The set contains 153 parts, and 1 minifig. There are a couple cool parts; the host, metal hook, square windshield, and crane boom. The minifig is a worker in black overalls with a hard hat, just who you would expect to run a crane!</p>

<p>The build is typical of the times. I think the mid-80&#39;s sets were some of the best builds in Lego&#39;s history. They are not the box like squares of years prior, and not the over styled sets of the post 1990 to current years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, back to the build. It starts with the minifig, as usual, then goes into the container, 6 steps and 21 parts later and it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>It then goes into the crane, starting at the chassis, working up into the body. This covers 10 steps, at which time it transitions into the crane body, another transition to the boom, completing the crane, at which time the assemblies come together, and the set is&nbsp;complete in 22 steps.</p>

<p>Playability of this set is 100%. Drive the truck to position. Swing out the out riggers and lower them down. Lift the boom and lock it in position. Use the crank to lower the hook, and extend the boom. Swing it over and lower the hook to the load. Crank up and get that container airborne! Load the container. Store the crane, raise the outriggers,&nbsp;and move to the next job!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a fan of cranes, I honestly love this set. The look and functionality are perfect. The colors are perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To give 1 up and 1 down:</p>

<p>Up: Almost a perfect set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Down: Limited adjustability of the crane boom. It&#39;s either stowed, or in a single fixed position when up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
