"CrimsonGuard","2023-01-07T07:41:14.73Z","Optimus Prime","<p>I had a lot of fun building this set. I really like the size, attention to detail and overall look of this model. I wish his knees were articulated though, that would have made this model even better.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;I finished the main model I started to build the accessories. The energon cube is a bit silly and does not really add to the set. The energy axe looks awfull, but the jetpack is great and really makes Optimus prime look good. The same goes for the gun (a surprisingly interesting build).</p>

<p>I really, really hope LEGO will continue this series with more classic G1 transformers.</p>
