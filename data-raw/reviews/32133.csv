","<p>The legendary Chevy Camaro has for many years been my favourite muscle car, so I obviously&nbsp;bought this set on its release day and was not disappointed. I don&#39;t know if this model really brings anything new in terms of building techniques to the collection of Creator Expert cars, but either way, it&#39;s a very fine addition. This model is filled with lots of nice details from the new fender pieces to the printed trans red taillights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<p>The colour could have definitely been more, well, colourful, but with the stripe options, red interior, and silver wheels, it&#39;s a great&nbsp;combo, and to the best of my knowledge, the only black CE car to date, so it will compliment the others nicely. The building process isn&#39;t anything ultra complex, its fairly simple brick on brick with a couple cool techniques like the bumpers thrown in to spice it up a bit. Of course the steering is connected, and the new silver wheels look great, although some less treaded tires&nbsp;would have suited it better. It would have been nice to have chrome, or at least silver, mirrors, door handles, and bumpers, but honestly they look just fine in simple light grey. The customisation options are very welcome here. I hate when there&#39;s a ton of leftover pieces sitting in the box for an option you&#39;ll just never use, and having a low budget makes it even worse. But there aren&#39;t too many leftover pieces in this set, and it&#39;s relatively easy to customise anyway, so I&#39;d say the extra pieces are worth the extra money in this case. I love the little 302 small block under the hood, its actually got some pretty good detail! There are a few stickers, but the only one you really need to worry about is the one on the&nbsp;air cleaner&nbsp;cover, and Lego has kindly printed the taillights and headlight covers. The doors, hood, and trunk open nicely, and even though the interior only has a basic light grey floor, the beautiful seats and dashboard easily make up for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bad:</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t understand Legos obsession with putting brightly coloured pieces inside these expensive display models that are owned by adults, and not little kids who really couldn&#39;t care less about seeing a blue piece behind the rear fender. Coloured pieces COMPLETELY HIDDEN are ok and do make it easier to build a complex structure, but here its unacceptable. Open the doors, bright red. Open the trunk, yellow, light grey and dark grey. Behind the rear fenders, blue. Under the hood, yellow, white, red, tan, light grey, and dark grey and Ill excuse some other ones in that area because I&#39;m getting bored. And one more minor problem I have with it is the three wide stripes on the hood change to four wide on the trunk. Not sure why, it doesn&#39;t bother me, it can easily be fixed, but yeah, its a bit weird once you notice it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall its a beautiful, accurate model thats fun to build,&nbsp;looks great on display, and is also quite tempting to get it out and just play with it! The price is fair, and becomes a little more reasonable if you actually like this exact car. As the only con here are ugly colours, some of which could be replaced during building, pros easily outweigh the cons. 9.5 out of 10&nbsp;</p>

"Duq","2022-11-28T22:02:34.12Z","The car is a classic, the set not so much","<p>After a Fiat, Porsche and another VW van the series returns to American muscle. Three years ago we had&nbsp;the awesome Mustang set, this time it&#39;s another classic, the Chevy Camaro. It&#39;s hard not to compare this set to its predecessor and unfortunately, it falls short. It&#39;s not all bad but it just has&nbsp;too many issues to give it a high score.</p>

<p>As soon as I opened the box we were off to a bad start as the loose sticker sheet had folded. A leaflet (in ink-consuming black background) told me there might be paper bags in my set as Lego is transitioning - there weren&#39;t any.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I won&#39;t describe every step of the build, just a few things that stood out.</p>

<p>The instruction book has a black cover, again without a set number. In fact I couldn&#39;t find the set number anywhere in the book. On page 8 it says: &quot;The three models can not be built simultaneously. You can find the instructions to these alternate models online at the Lego website.&quot; Only, the instructions are all in the book...</p>

<p>The order of building the car&nbsp;didn&#39;t flow. For example the base of the engine is built and then left until I think two bags later before the engine is finished. There were a few moments where the model was awkward to hold in order to add parts. The colour options were also not explained very well in the instructions, making you build the grey version before showing you the other options. Towards the end the instruction fork, for the hard top and convertible options. Both contain identical steps for the boot and wheels...</p>

<p>Having said that, there are some nice techniques to enjoy. The way the rear window is attached using parts from the new City steering/ suspension system is very clever. The steering system is interesting and&nbsp;well designed, with a good steering lock.</p>

<p>After building the hard-top with regular headlights you have about 90 parts left (not counting the usual spares).</p>

<h3>The finished model</h3>

<p>At first glance it&#39;s an attractive car. The colour scheme of black exterior and dark red interior&nbsp;works well. I picked white for the stripes as it brightens up an otherwise dark car. It&nbsp;seems the most common choice in the real world as well according to Google image search.</p>

<p>The overall shape is pretty good, but the transition from the door to the rear panels looks wrong; the doors are a plate too high or the rear&nbsp;is a plate too low. The transition from hood to windscreen is not great either, with a sizeable gap and the back of the cowl doesn&#39;t look good.</p>

<p>Bright colours in invisible places are common in Lego sets as they help you &#39;navigate&#39; the model. However on this model there&#39;s a line of bright red brackets when you open the doors, there bright yellow in the boot (that &#39;bleeds&#39; through above the bumper), tan under the transmission tunnel, bright yellow and tan in the engine bay.</p>

<p>The dashboard is kinda bare with only two stickers depicting a radio and a few dials, and there are no pedals. The fluffy dice are a nice touch though, as is the Model Team Magazine on the back seat.</p>

<p>Stickers for A-pillars are a popular cheat, and in this case the black strips you put on either side of the windscreen are too short; they stop above the wing mirrors but should really have run behind them.</p>

<h3>Play</h3>

<p>This is primarily a display model but it does have a few functions. Steering works, doors open, seats fold forward, the boot open and the bonnet... err... yes, it opens, but it&#39;s really awkward. You have to get a grip on the cowl and the pull up without your fingers slipping.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is an ok set, but no highlight in the series. There are just too many small annoyances. For the price I would have liked some printed bricks. Personally I would have preferred white stripes and a hard top without the customisations and a slightly lower price tag.</p>
