I am by no means wealthy. As soon as the announcement was made for this set, I decided I would move heaven and earth to get my hands on it.</p>

<p>I had saved up enough VIP points to take $20 off, and I received some birthday money from relatives that helped to further offset the cost. I ended up paying about $270 out of pocket. While I felt some guilt about indulging in something that was a bit fiscally irresponsible, my wife was very supportive and understanding of my excitement.</p>

<p>I stayed up late to put in my order the night it released to VIPs, and after I clicked Checkout, I had mixed emotions of immense anticipation and that nagging guilt. But the deed was done. I had crossed the Rubicon.</p>

<p><strong>The Box:</strong> When the package arrived and I opened it, I was immediately hit with a wave of nostalgia. All the financial concerns were swept away as my eyes soaked in a very familiar background encompassing the image of a set that was at once both the embodiment of my childhood and so much more.</p>

<p><strong>The Instructions:</strong> The first of two instruction manuals shares some cool information about the development of the set and its sources of information. I actually gathered my family around and read these blurbs aloud to them. It felt too special to pass them by.</p>

<p>Periodically throughout the instructions Majisto the wizard chimes in to comment on the progress of the build or the parts usage. These are occasionally funny, and sometimes even offer some foreshadowing. I enjoyed that addition to the manual.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong> I personally believe that when you purchase a LEGO set, you&#39;re not just paying for the parts or the finished product, but the <strong><em>experience</em> </strong>of building it. This is particularly true of advanced models. In my household, we almost always build new LEGO sets together, regardless of who bought it or received it. My wife, kids and I took turns building, and we frequently marvelled at the techniques employed in its design. It is absolutely brilliant engineering. Mike and Milan are now legends in my book. Even something as ordinary as a wall is full of character. There are very few repetitive sections. It is almost completely asymmetrical, and I never felt like any portion of the build was tedious. The functional elements, such as the portcullis, drawbridge, waterwheel / mill and secret doors are thrilling to watch come together. The static elements are no less captivating, and certainly beautiful.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Parts:</strong> Unlike many of the predecessors that inspired its creation, the Lion Knights&#39; Castle doesn&#39;t have many large parts. No massive raised baseplate, no BURPs, hardly any tall wall segments. The glorious edifice is an honest-to-goodness brick-built castle.<br />
<br />
There are so many uncommon or new parts that you&#39;ll find in abundance, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Inverted 1x3 tiles</li>
	<li>1/2 half circle bricks</li>
	<li>1x1 studs-on-the-side plates with two studs vertically</li>
	<li>2x3 plates with cutout</li>
	<li>1x1x.66 plates...so much nicer than stacking normal 1x1s</li>
</ul>

<p>I could keep going, but suffice it to say that if you ever chose to deconstruct this masterpiece for your own MOC purposes, you would have an incredible array of useful and versatile parts.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures &amp; Animals:</strong> There are so many, and they are so good. I can&#39;t get over how much I love the polished re-envisioning of the classic Lion and Falcon tabards. And despite the matching uniforms on many of the knights, no two are exactly alike. Every face is different, and there are several different helmets used. I am thrilled that they included some civilians and children, and the Forestmen family is just the best.</p>

<p>The animals are as varied as the people. A cow, two horses with different and uncommon coats, an adorable little lamb, a bird, a frog and a &quot;frog&quot; (no spoilers). The variety of colours is refreshing. My only lament, as others have mentioned, is the omission of a goat. You&#39;ve got to think they&#39;d see our complaints and cave at some point!<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall Opinion:</strong> There&#39;s no arguing that this is an incredibly expensive set. And LEGO perhaps has started making too many massive, high-end sets for much of its market. I would love for a more moderate return of Classic Castle that would accommodate the limits of my wallet better.<br />
<br />
But with all that said, the Lion Knights&#39; Castle is worth every penny of that steep price tag. It&#39;s amazing as either a display model or a play set. My kids and I have been playing with it all morning since we finished building it. And like I said, you&#39;re paying for an <em>experience </em>as much as the plastic. The time spent putting it together is nothing short of sheer joy.</p>

<p>If you, like me, love Classic Castle, want an engaging build with little repetition and packed with interesting techniques and cool parts usage, and want to bask in the realised potential of LEGO bricks, this set is an absolute must. Do what you can to get it. Sell something on Ebay. Donate plasma. Pick up an extra shift for a week.<br />
<br />
I have occasionally passed on sets that I really wanted because I didn&#39;t feel like I could justify it financially, and I still have regrets...(cough cough Medieval Market Village, Kingdoms Joust cough). But I will have no regrets this time. <em>No regrets</em>.</p>
