<p>The designer at the LEGO Group is quite successful in creating combination from variety of succulents that available in real-life. When you look at the built set from afar or medium distance, you will think that these plants which made of LEGO parts are real. Only when you stand next to it, you will see that these succulents are made of LEGO parts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/046670c8-aa42-405e-bd70-14a722276205/IMG_6248.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>When viewed from the top, this LEGO succulents also look real. But if you notice them closely, some parts look out of place, and you can see the outline of the LEGO parts. The best position to view this set is horizontally level at your eyes or diagonally downwards. You should keep that in mind when deciding where to display them.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1650114960116-943ML0T16VHVY2ICOLU9/IMG_6260.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>An advantage of this Succulents set is that all the nine plants have their own small pot, and you can separate them into individual plant in pot just like in the photo above. So you can freely move them separately or altogether to display.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1650115231992-48DGFDMAKQVYUW98BLSG/IMG_6268.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>If you want to, you can separate them into smaller group for display. So you will have quite a lot of combination possibility! Of course your imagination is the limit.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1650115659966-IWOVOA1IFQHT9L18VSD9/IMG_6266.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>This set still has some minor issue such as the technic parts shown on the Aloe plant like in the photo above. The grey parts seem out of place. It would be better if TLG get that parts in green colour like the rest of the parts used on this Aloe plant.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1650115664541-1UMAKHPHV8WZJLWEZ8T0/IMG_6278.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>Similarly, with the red echeveria and ball cactus, they have their parts in colours that look out of place. I am only guessing that TLG does not have those parts in colours that match the actual plants body.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/5926fb2b-3729-4dce-a84f-536217fb2f01/IMG_6270.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>This set has a feature to store the technic pins used as connectors between the small pot. So this is the only plant that does not sit secured on the pot. Could you notice something different from this plant from the photo above? This plant is using the LEGO Castle forestmen&nbsp;hats!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/50d892b9-c48a-4408-81d3-a33030808c48/IMG_6325.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>The red echeveria plant also have an interesting part used to build its base. It uses a number of submachine guns! This gun used as part seems to contradict this&nbsp;set which is used for relaxation and mindfulness. Or maybe it means to symbolise laying down the arms or burying the hatchet.&nbsp;??</p>

<p>This set has three separate assembling booklets, so you can invite two other builders to build this set together. It is very nice as more people can join in the fun of assembling LEGO together. It can be used on gathering, family or office events.</p>

<p>The first page of the manual will describe about the succulents and showing what the real plants look like.</p>

<p>The next page will show you the opinion of the LEGO designer who design this set. There is also description that explain the succulents on this set can be displayed individually.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>When building the plant individually, I am having so much fun. Especially that each plant is in separate small bags. So we won&#39;t be overwhelmed when opening the bag with a huge amount of parts like in Creator Expert set. Why I did not give full score for the building experience is because of the tightly packed succulents which will make you have to readjust some plants notably the Aloe and purple echeveria.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set provides more parts than the set 10311 orchids. But don&#39;t get it wrong, this set is a lot smaller than orchid due to it shorter height.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Not much since this set is for display only. But of course you can change the composition of the plants when bunched up together, or you can display them separately or in smaller groups. Since I consider changing composition for display equal to playability, it will explain my score of 4.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much since I get this set for free. But judging from the price shown on LEGO US website, I can say this price is okay. Good thing that it is not a licensed set.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/review-lego-botanical-collection-10309-succulents"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

"GeorgeArt16","2023-01-05T16:42:59.107Z","10309 Succulents","<p>The LEGO Botanical Collection has an interesting and often beautiful selection of sets that reflect real life flowers and plants. 10309 Succulents includes 9 different species of succulent plants, such as an Aloe Vera plant and the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnocalycium_mihanovichii"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">Gymnocalycium mihanovichii</a>&nbsp;cactus. The set includes three separate instruction booklets covering three different plants each, which I believe makes it more complicated if anything.</p>

<p>This set uses several interesting pieces to accomplish the various shapes and angles of these natural-looking plants, including buildable figure shoulder pads, yellowish green egg elements, and even <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-62885"">62885</a> submachine guns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These different plants look convincing enough when it is all put together. The black pots they all are built onto are connected using small technic axle pins, and the order can be rearranged, though the size of some plants makes certain combinations difficult or impossible without altering the build.</p>

<p>Overall, this set shows impressive use of different LEGO elements to capture a natural feel of these diverse plants, and looks great on display with other Botanical Collection sets. I would recommend this set to anyone who values other sets in the Botanical Collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Fun to build, visually appealing, sophisticated 18+ set.</p>

<p>Cons: Somewhat expensive ($49.99,&nbsp;&euro;49.99), unnecessarily split up instructions</p>
