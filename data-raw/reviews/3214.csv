Comes with a desk, counter, a drop-off box/area, parcel shelf, and postal delivery truck. My only comment is that it comes with only one minifig; it should include at least one customer. Otherwise, this is a fine little set and a must for any LEGO fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Everything a good post office needs is there - a desk for customers and a place for the postman. This one is way bigger than the later set and gives much more playability. Wonderful set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"vincent_vda","2008-12-28T08:19:00.78Z","First set ever","This was my very first LEGO playset, and not much is left of it today. A pity, as this is a nice post office set you get here, complete with a little car and a cool mailbox. I liked how the office fits on street plates next to the roads.

Today only the mini figure, mailbox, a few windows (very modern at the time) and some letters survive.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The letter boxes with matching letters was just so awesome...and I can't believe how much fun I had with them.&nbsp; Slotting the letters into the box and then opening the back of the box to remove them surprisingly provided a huge amount of fun.<br><br>My most memorable moment with this set occurred when some friends of my parents came over for a visit.&nbsp; They bought their son along as well and he wanted to play with the Post Office.&nbsp; Unfortunately...he wasn't able to...why??...because his family had arrived at our place at 1pm...and according to the sticker on the front door of the Post Office...it was closed between 12 and 2!!<br><br>6362 was succeeded by the much smaller 6689 in 1985 but thereafter no further Post Office sets were released during the Classic Town period.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The very colourful bricks include a giant postal service sign, two post boxes, a mail truck/post van, a postmaster, an outdoor parcel shelf, glass panels and a door with the hours of service on! A really fun build, this open backed building allows many ideas to unfold inside. The only thing lacking is one other member of staff- this chap is probably pretty busy.</div><div><br></div><div>The build or rather builds include the short chassis mail pick up and the building that has a good IZ and plenty of interaction potential. Its got lots of 'glass' and makes a sensible but small office and stacking area. The blue roof is a little odd on top of red but despite the choice of black, this fits in with much of the 1980s era Town image.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember you can stuff the post box full of letter bricks though doing this to a sibling's postman repeatedly, usually makes them groan and have to collect and deliver yet more mail.</div><div><br></div><div>Stickers unfortunately form all the signs and symbols including the excellent opening times and they deteriorate badly with play. If strong enough they may be able to be removed with alcohol, cleaned and re-stuck with... stick glue? maybe best clipped between bricks using a paper backing? It does not detract from the enjoyment of the set too much at all though.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Lost In The Mail</b></div><div>Find and buy this old set for your kids, I'm sure they will take to it.&nbsp;The other Postal figures and vehicles match perfectly and its been mentioned by other reviewers there is a lack of modern equivalents.

I am surprised as how good it still looks amongst my growing city-scape! I cannot believe after all these years my brother and I managed to keep the large postal logo attached to those 3 yellow 1x4's<br>You can see that Lego today has come pretty far, well in comparison to this set any way in terms of detail. The white packages are about as basic as you can get. The opening hours on the door are a nice touch. Either way until I re-build my 6689 Post Office (which will go out in the suburbs) I'm sure Mr Postman will have his hands full with the growing population!<br><br>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4

<ul><li>Should be another minifig (I had to use the minifig from 6420 to help out)</li></ul>I found this set in in a cupboard at my house, so I decided to s build it and see what it looked like in my town.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Suddendly Lego created the Post and minifigs started having a new hobby: after the exclusiveness of the walky-talky, here comes the supremacy of the envelop. You will find this envelops everywhere in the 1982-1985 Lego sets. The Minifigs spend their time carrying envelops from the mailbox to the garden table our they even carry them in their car (6374)<br></li><li>So If you want your 80's minifigure keep smiling, you urgently need this Post Office.</li><li>Nice detail inside the post Office: Mail Basket<br></li></ul><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Niki124","2021-02-04T20:18:48.343Z","Would give it 6 out of 5 if I could","<p>I loved this set. New pieces (the post boxes), a simple smart look, and a great vehicle. Loved the little sticker for the door with the opening times, but less so the large symbol over the door, which did not survive the dismantling and rebuilding.</p>

<p>It was rare for us to dismantle and rebuild vehicles, but I think I tried with this one, deciding that as an open-back truck there may be some versatility. No doubt there would be with a few extra bricks, but for the limited number in the original it couldn&#39;t be beaten.</p>

<p>The building gave lots of scope for alternative designs. The floor-to-ceiling windows and combination of sloping and flat roof areas - plus the little gates - mean it&#39;s not difficult to come up with your own highly-playable designs. Maybe the set could have been improved with an additional minifigure customer, but I guess they&#39;d probably spend a lot of time riding in the back of the truck instead of queueing.</p>
