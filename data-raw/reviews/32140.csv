<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1650172924461-S7WKO29WV79H2YFAOCLL/IMG_6337.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>This Orchid set has less part count than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10309-1/Succulents"">10309 succulents</a> set, but this set has a size that is a lot taller than the succulents set. As you can see from the photo above, the orchid looks so realistic from far away and medium distance. Only when you are standing next to this set then you can realise it is not a real orchid.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/019335e4-c67a-47b8-a2b0-8fe5452349d4/Moth+Orchid.jpg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 419px;"" /></p>

<p>First, I need to explain that the orchid used for this LEGO set is the species commonly cultivated. The orchid is called&nbsp;Moth Orchid which is within&nbsp;<em>phalaenopsis&nbsp;</em>genus. The selection of this type of orchid could be because a lot of people used to see this type or orchid [photo taken from Wikimedia Commons].</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/bd02ecc3-7b96-494f-b493-34644c784866/IMG_6345.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>From close-up of the flowers, we can see the LEGO designer is quite successful in creating the orchid. I quite like this orchid. It is suitable to be displayed at home and add aesthetic value as decoration. And as a plus point, this orchid set already includes the blue vase which is a terrific idea.</p>

<p>As you can see from the photos that are posted here, the stems of the plant use LEGO Technic parts which is a brilliant idea, however, the grey pin looks so out of place (look at the photo below on the upper part, and you can see the grey pin).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/4c71388b-aa75-42f9-9d28-1f8131dee909/IMG_6351.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>When we take a close up look, we can see the centre of the Moth Orchid utilise a simple component. It even uses a pink frog. The designer at LEGO Group with their creativity mind again use the frog part like with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10281-1/Bonsai-Tree"">LEGO 10281 Bonsai Tree</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/346ac353-3348-49fb-9bb0-c6cc70d72001/IMG_6353.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The orchid that is just blooming is represented using the Demogorgon head from LEGO Stranger Things set with other pattern and colour suitable for orchid. For the small buds, it is represented by pink ice cream part.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/16a9e3a0-d950-4ea6-9949-884f9e8e2dba/IMG_6347.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>At the lower part, we can find leaves that are surprisingly, look like real leaves found on orchid. We can also see the air roots of orchid which utilise dinosaurs&#39; tail parts. The blue fluted vase matches with the colour of the potting mix and the leaves.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/3bf663c4-7b31-484d-9df8-0276b8375894/IMG_6343.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>We can find on top of the vase the potting materials for this Orchid. This supposedly potting materials have another function which is to cover the LEGO Technic parts used for the frame of the vase.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/3d49dfb2-dce4-43cc-8d55-5d80b5386b75/IMG_6363.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see the inside of the vase that utilise variation of Technic components that are very helpful in uniting all the parts to build this LEGO vase, so it would not become loose easily.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/5f849b2e-5557-4c15-898b-d69b5592618b/IMG_6367.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There are three different&nbsp;(four if we consider difference in colour) component combinations of LEGO parts used for the potting materials from the photo above. Two of the components on the right-hand side are the claws that used on retired LEGO Nexo Knights theme sets.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/fd53c98c-c472-4b9f-826e-26e7dec775a5/IMG_6361.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Beside the LEGO Technic component mentioned earlier on the stem, there is another obvious eye-catching issue which is the green 2 x 2 tiles on the leaves that use to combine two parts for the leaf. But of course the LEGO Group could not just create a new streamlined part&nbsp;that reflects real leaf if it could not find other use. So for now we should be satisfied with this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/04dbbc00-695c-485b-b653-2103bf710c99/Manual+Book.jpg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>Like all set for adult, the front part of this manual book depict the orchid set after assembly. It has black background that usually indicate sets for 18+ or advanced LEGO builder that like challenges.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/149c3917-36f0-40d3-8086-f7bdb5d5e3ed/Manual+Book2.jpg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>On the first couple of pages, we can find various information about this set and the designer that design the set. Last thing that should be remembered for this set, we can somehow have a various setup for the flowers&#39; positioning on the stems. So everyone can come up with different flower arrangements.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is really enjoyable. The most boring part will be when assembling the blue vase, there will be repetitive building involving the LEGO Technic set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts are quite OK for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Not much since this set is for display only. But of course you can change the flowers&#39; arrangement on the stems for a bit of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much since I get this set for free. But judging from the price shown on LEGO US website, I can say this price is not bad, especially the orchid is quite tall! If you can get it at promo or discount, it is even better!</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/review-lego-botanical-collection-10311-orchid"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
