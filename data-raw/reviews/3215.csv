"villicus","2008-05-02T13:25:47.483Z","this is always a colour stain","A nice little place to repair all the cars in the city. Some tools and I love the way the car lifter is built. There you see, all you need is some bulk brick. No need for another car lifter, and hey, this one works! I can't remember how many cars it had to lift and take care, the car doesn't fall down on the repair man sometimes. I hope the hospital is close! A nice set. I prefer this one and the 6369 from all later ones which seems to be a bit odd compared to the earlier ones.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"David1971","2008-06-13T09:40:18.56Z","Spanners!","When I was nine years old, I found seven pounds on some steps from a car park in Devon, UK, while on summer holiday. My parents said I had to hand it in to the police, so we did. Happily nobody claimed it so six weeks later we got the seven pounds in the post. I knew what I wanted to spend it on! I took my Dad to Woolco (like a big Woolworths) and said I had to get the Lego mechanic's garage, i.e. this set.

It looks quite basic now, but this seemed GREAT at the time, and having little tools like a spanner for the minifigs was amazing in 1980. Although I knew very little about proper cars I liked being a Lego mechanic and this set was just right. You even got a tree. Brilliant.

"Speninator","2009-06-14T14:06:20.09Z","cool!","This set is the auto repair shop from 1980. The way you can open the window is pretty cool, and the door and the car doors can open too! It comes with some accessories like a few wrenches, a radio, and a jack. The jack can be used to lift up small cars (not the tow truck, as it is too high). The minifig is great, and he can go inside the building. All that this needs is a road base plate. The car (tow truck) has a hook on the back, rare tyres, opening doors and a seat for the driver. This set even came with  tree! How great is that?

PROS
tow truck could be a set itself
tree
jack can actually lift cars for the minifig to work on them
opening doors and windows
lots of pieces
fun build
lots of wrenches
uses mainly 1x1s, 1x6s, and 1x4s.
gos well with other Lego buildings
not junorized!

CONS
cars can slip off the jack
tree is hard to put on the plate
no chair inside.

Also, the instructions for this set are fold out instructions, not  booklets!
You put on about 10 pieces per step, impressive to today's sets. This set is a must-buy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vincent_vda","2009-06-29T18:20:18.31Z","A nice basic town set","From the early 80's comes this little gem of a set. I actually owned it but was missing quite a few bricks and pieces. Thanks to the Internet I was able to get some of those I needed and put together this little vintage LEGO garage for my town.

Pros:
-A lot of action in a little set
-Garage and store
-Unique stickers

Cons:
-Lame tow truck (but not forgetting it's 1980)
-A bit small",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JeffS","2010-09-22T15:01:32.143Z","Awesome","I bought this set when it first came out. I enjoyed all the special parts such as the moveable doors and windows, the lights and the radio and tools. The mechanic was my favorite mini figure and still is with his red zippered jacket. The tow truck could be rebuilt into a 4-wheel drive truck by using the example on the box. My kit was used as the&nbsp;minifigs house with his truck and you gotta love the landscaping!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"George_Legoman","2020-11-12T09:38:57.837Z","All in one Classic Town set","<p>This was my first ever Lego set back in 1980..<br />
<br />
It combines building experience for both the blue building (garage) and the beautiful yellow tow truck. This is an awesome motive for multiple variations of mocs due to the 141 total Lego parts which through their &quot;simplicity&quot; were not that common back in 1980.</p>

<p>A great addition to any Legoland /&nbsp;Classic Town!</p>

<p>Nice part notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;The yellow windows and the yellow door</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The tilted red crane and the red tools bar of the tow truck</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The red uniform minifigure and its accessories</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The green tree</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The yellow stickers</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The Old Leight Grey antenna and base</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The two coloured garage with the wonderful black lower perimetrical detail</li>
</ul>

<p>So much fun building with this set&#39;s parts over and over again..</p>
