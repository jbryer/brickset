A good looking set with nice details: wall eye chart, daily diary on the desk, and a bed for examination or rest. One of only two medical buildings (6380 is the other), this medical clinic is a must for any LEGo town. And the skylight is great!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-24T23:52:48Z","A must for any Lego fan","A nice small set and a good addition to any LEGO town! Comes with a desk, sick bed, and an emergency paramedic vehicle. Comes with two minifigs. Some of the details are stickers: an eye chart behind the desk and appointment book on the desk. 

A fine little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Try as I might I was never able to find and get this set until 27 years later thanks to eBay.  The set is as nice as I had imagined.  The Dr. is even female.  A boon to feminist lego women everywhere.  She can make housecalls in her car and the male Office Assistant can make appointments from his desk.  A fun little set in the same niche as the the blue repair shop.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-10T20:15:55.217Z","Great Set Overall","Lego didn't make too many hospitals or clinics in the 1980s. This is one of those sets that was in that genre. I like the building alot and makes me think of a clinic for the minifigs. The car is pretty cool, too, but it could't take a patient to the hospital. Overall, this set is great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-10T14:35:45.327Z","Not A Full Sized Hospital But A Clinic","Lego has (surprisingly) only provided a few hospitals throughout the years.  Three by my count/memory (although there was a mysterious one that appeared in some old catalogs; I still wonder about that one!)  Here, Lego did something unusual in providing a scaled down version in having a small medical clinic.  This set is more versatile than one would believe.  Although there's what appears to be a nurse and probably a patient or doctor along with a medical car, you can convert this spot over into a dentist shop just by removing the little medical sign above the building.

It's very unique in that it adds a more local feeling to the neighborhood.  Kid sick or hurt his ankle at the high school soccer game?  Bring him here.  Need to check your eyes out?  There's a little eye checking board (I forget what they call them).  You can easily place this into your neighborhood. My dentist shop for example kinda looks similar.  Or you can convert this shop into something else, maybe a home or a grocery store.  It's a nice generic building that can be used for all types of purposes.  Again fun set.  Wish Lego had more like these.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J_tje","2010-02-06T02:57:43.95Z","Great Introduction of the Medical Profession in LegoTown","As this is the set that started the Town-Medical series (9 pcs) I think Lego did an excelent job.

Features: Examine table, desk/reception, doctors car, great skylight, some greenery.

Can easily be converted into something else. (shop, office, etc).

The beauty of this set is that it can easily be reconstructed with ""basic"" blocks. (Stickers can be made from the picture on bricklink) No really special pieces.
The unique female doctor with stetoscope minifig is one of the few rare items.
