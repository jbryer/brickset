As I always try to accommodate these sets into my lego city display, I was a bit sceptical with this one. Anyway, I&#39;ve decided to put this one together with my three kids and it was a blast!</p>

<p>First of all, the set contains 6 separate builds each with its own instruction booklet - this was a gamechanger to building together as we were actually able to enjoy the building experience without unnecessary discussions who does what, builds which step or page while the rest is looking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondly the scenes are great, very well depicted and it automatically gave us the purpose to discuss and actually learn something about the Chinese New Year traditions.</p>

<p>Last but not least, although I rather saw this as a display set, my kids immediately found a way to play with it, build up stories and use the different scenes for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Concluding, I think that everyone will find something interesting in this set - either if you are an AFOL, a parent or a kid :) To me as an AFOL it is the selection of the minifigs, quite interesting range of parts and the quality of the scenes which are represented. For that reason I would recommend that either if you want to actually build and display it or use it as a source of parts for other builds.</p>

The steps are not too difficult (except for the technic centre spoke) to follow for a 6-year-old and an 11 year old, nor are the builds too long and laborious. Love the concept of packaging it to easily build together.</p>

<p>The parts are amazing in this set. Lots of new parts in the pearl gold, printed pieces and new torsos. Yes, there are stickers, but they add a valuable dimension to it that makes the easily to overlook.</p>

<p>As far as playability, this will vary. I&#39;m vaguely familiar with some of the traditions illustrated, but having grown up in the West where such celebrations are a faint glimmer of what they&#39;re meant to be like - I couldn&#39;t understand all of the vignettes and Easter eggs.</p>

<p>Enter my wife who grew up in HK and is well versed in the rich traditions of CNY. She was able to read all of the text, help us decipher and make sense of all the little scenes, accessories included as well as all of the prints etc. I didn&#39;t realise I knew so little about my own culture, and my kids got the benefit of the lesson as well. My son in particular likes to play with the countdown scene, while my daughter likes the tangerine tree scene. I like the scene with the elderly parents where one shared blessings with each other for the new year.... mostly because this pandemic has made spending time with my elderly parents precious.</p>

<p>Anyhow, anyway you look at it - the set is a winner ! I just wish TLG could make more sets of this exceptional calibre more often for such a reasonable price.</p>
