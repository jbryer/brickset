All the decorated elements are printed- yay! The minifigs are stellar. The tiger, the retro puffy winter coat and the fisherman with the nod to Ice Planet 2002 are my favorites.</p>

<p>My only issue is with the &quot;ice&quot; itself. While I love the transparent satin white/ opal wall element used for the ice, they scratch very easy. The fact that you have to build using SNOT pieces *over* the those transparent panels could cause scratches if you&#39;re not careful. There is also step where, while building the large ice sculpture, you push a technic axel down onto the ice element itself. Yikes. I haven&#39;t taken mine apart to check, so I hope they aren&#39;t actually damaged, but this seems like an unwise way to build over the ice here. Playability overall is also reduced since the main thing is to have people moving around the pond on skates, which will just scratch everything.</p>

<p>Other than that, this set is great. The little skate rental shop is adorable, and the photo booth is a nice feature (especially because the insert isn&#39;t just flimsy bendable cardboard, its some kinda of plastic thing). I love anything winter, so this added a lot of winter elements I didn&#39;t have (snowy plants, ice, new skis, various penguins) to my collection.</p>

Unlike all the other New Year sets, there really is no connection to Chinese New Year in the scene. That said, it is really fun, winter diorama and, it can easily be converted to fit your Winter Village if you wanted to.</p>

<p>The build feels more like a MOC because so much of the parts and steps are devoted to building up what is essentially snow and a sheet of ice. From that perspective, the set does feel a bit expensive. In some ways, its equivalent would be set 80107 Spring Lantern Festival in that they&#39;re both landscapes and quite a bit of time was devoted to building the pond with kofi fish. That set felt more &#39;worth it&#39; though, I think mostly because it felt more structured whereas the mounds of snow tend to make this one feel less designed, though this is the opposite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some steps were actually quite tricky and, we had to rebuild a few times to get it right. It also didn&#39;t help that the majority of the base is white it&#39;s hard to distinguish where you are putting new white pieces.It would have been helpful to see the red outlines of new pieces that Lego used to use in their instructions for this set.</p>

<p>This set has some really great parts, especially those new panels for the ice. If you have extra white tiles, place them underneath to hide the studs. It wil make it look like ice even more. Many new Trans blue parts (clips and bars) made possible using their new plastics.</p>

<p>Lots of playability. My daughter and I intend to make some nice stop-motion videos of the skaters because this set is so open and lends itself easily to playing and photography.</p>

<p>All in all, a really fun set with a few minor niggles.</p>
