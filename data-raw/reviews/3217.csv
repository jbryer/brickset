It congers up memories of leaving the rat race and stress back home for a little R&amp;R in the country.  Laying back and letting the stress of the week melt away, I also remember a small boat I built from the assorted brick tub I had  to ensure that it truly was a good time for all. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The outer design with its shuttered windows and flowery garden brings to mind images of peaceful country retreats, whilst the interior is well-designed with a kitchen and bedroom.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I also like the patio with the table and swivel chair. This house is certainly a house that every minifig would like to live in. 5 out of 5 for a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"T79","2014-08-21T08:31:47.497Z","My first house, and the first house I rebuilt now","<p>The first house I can remember I had, it has been built and rebuilt countless times. In fact, so many times&nbsp;that I could almost build this by heart some years later.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>That was a good thing too, since the box and instructions were both lost later on. The general shape of the house still clung in my memory, however. So much so that even years later I still built houses in the same pattern, in fact when my children received a box of&nbsp;basic lego (#4225, which I found&nbsp;MISB&nbsp;for&nbsp;&euro;1 in a&nbsp;second hand store last year)&nbsp;the first thing I did was build a small version of this cottage! But it&#39;s the small details that I haven&#39;t seen built since more then 25 years.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One of those details was the bedside lamp, for example. I can still remember always being puzzled by that transparent minifig head in our collection, where on earth did that come from? What was it used for?&nbsp;Now I know again, I&#39;d never have guessed it came from this set. The windows and door have been used a lot, although the clips on those&nbsp;windows had this nasty tendency to snap, almost all my windows had to go without shutters after a while.&nbsp;I still had the shutters and have now bought new windows but these black ones were surprisingly expensive, at least compared to the red ones I bought for another set. The stickers used for the oven and refrigerator have been lost too, unfortunately. For these reasons I gave a &#39;three&#39; here, even though the parts selection is pretty good.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This minifig&#39;s idea of a summer holiday seems to be tranquility and solitude as she&#39;s all alone. It&#39;s a very nice figure though, with black ponytails, red pants and a black vest over a red shirt.&nbsp;We had some more of these torsos with a blue shirt but this is the only one in red in our collection. She comes with a white chair and two yellow cups, and most importantly a white/red striped parasol which has sadly faded a bit over the years.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>An uncomplicated build even the children can get done. Exceptions are aligning the door so a plate can be&nbsp;laid down&nbsp;over it to hold it in place and the sloped roof which is a bit harder to get done for small kids:&nbsp;you have to stack those slope bricks which are only supported on one side, press down too hard and they cave in.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, a very nice looking cottage. Like I said before, the basic pattern for this house has been ingrained in my brain and still surfaced about 30 years later when I built a small house for the children which looked a lot like a smaller version of this cottage. In fact I built a lot of houses&nbsp;with the same, L-shaped, pattern. A favourite pastime was using #838 Red Roof Bricks Parts Pack, 45&deg; to build up the flat roof with a sloped roof to match the other side. I also liked the alternative model with the roof going down to the ground but I only remembered that now because I saw the scanned manual at Peeron.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For nostalgic reasons I&#39;d easily put a &#39;five&#39; as overall score but I already did that with the building experience. Too bad those windows broke so easily, I hope this was due to an error in the mould or the plastic and hopefully the replacement parts prove to be more durable. The next generation of builders is now ready to be inspired, it is very well received at least!</p>

<p>So, when I was 35 :) I decided to buy to satisfy my old desire. It&#39;s a very nice set, with special details inside.</p>
