"folkform","2006-07-16T22:49:08Z","Great fun","I highly recommend this set.  The middle size vehicle is a bit plain, but the main engine and the motorcycle more than make up for it.  The rotating ladder and the fire hose are great to play with, especially when you are playing with houses.  The other side of the main engine has a hatch compartment and a great little axe.  I love this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2008-01-12T00:42:24.153Z","A nice addition to your fleet","One of my favorite things about this set is the vertical windshield on the large truck.  This vehicle would often find itself inside the garage of my fire station (#6382).  As mentioned in another review, the small truck is more of an 80's version of a &quot;smart car&quot; than a fire truck (it looks EXTREMELY wimpy when placed next to the Off Road Fire Rescue truck (#7942)), but I did like the motorcycle.  Although I'm not sure what good a firefighter on a motorcycle would actually be, I was happy to have a Lego motorcycle since I was envious of my brother's Motorcycle Repair Shop (#6373). 

Since there were many similarities between the large truck in this set and the one with Fire Station 6382, I would combine the pieces and build a SUPER fire truck, which would then of course require combining the two garage bays into one extra tall bay, which would further require a complete redesign of the whole building... but that was the fun with Lego toys.  90% of my Lego time was spent building new creations rather than actually playing with the finished models.

This particular set has just 1 short of 100 pieces, and with this set alone there are many alternate building opportunities.  Some shown on the back of the box include a tow truck with a small car in tow and even a drag racer.

For a mid-priced set, this one is really very good.  The vertical windshield, three minifigs and the cool storage compartment on the right side of the large truck are all very nice.  About the only things I would add would be one more ladder section to the large truck (like the one with Fire Station 6382) and perhaps a red 1x2 plate to pin the ladder down instead of it riding between the lights on the cab (also as in the 6382 truck).  Over all, this is a great addition to any Lego fire collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;box was pretty nice, it had several models on the back like any standard lego set of the 80&#39;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions also similar to all sets with very easy to follow instructions</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice parts that you could find in any fire station, loved the the windshield of the fire engine because it was not that common to all lego sets just in big trucks,&nbsp; the fire hose was very standard but again if you didnt own any other fire theme lego set it was a nice addition.&nbsp; The red motorcycle was very nice because it had also a windshield that was not that common too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3 firemen, 1 of them with a helmet since it was&nbsp;the bike driver</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a very nice set, because if you already own a fire station it was a perfect compliment to all the fire vehicles that usually came with it, or if it was like my case that you didnt own a fire station this would be the back bone of your fire brigade.&nbsp; I personally have a lot of fun with this set, because it came with a big fire engine with rescue ladder and fire hose and also a small sort of pick up truck (very typical of early Lego sets) and motorcycle with a windshield that made it very elegant looking, so overall i give it a 5 since it was not even expensive.&nbsp; For a medium set of that time it was a set with a lot of playability in and stand alone mode or a great addition to your city if you had more sets.</p>

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-08-08T05:30:42.277Z","Fire Fleet","<div>The fire service were in a period of development around these years and while I favoured the original black helmets, it still surprises me that they never once went with yellow? A sibling possessed this little bundle of red vehicles.</div><div><br></div><b>Minifigures:</b><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>The white bike helmet makes a good variant fireman.</li></ul>The two red belt and brass button printed black uniforms are smart as ever.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Red Brick Alert<br></b></div><div>The first up for build of the fleet is the straight forward motorbike. Any kid can build a Lego bike but looking after the vulnerable machine is another matter. Those poor handle bars can get wrecked during 'stunts' and 'crashes' while the excellent windshield present for slotting in, is just waiting to be cracked or rendered opaque by scrabbling it in the brick box. The bike is great though with white tiles, blue light and headlight, these square lights conjuring up an atmosphere of yesteryear layouts. So the fireman is pretty neat on his ride and provides rapid response but he'll have to wait for the hose and ladder.</div><div><br></div><div>Next is a peculiarly small fire service pick up. Like a cab thats lost its trailer, this diminutive truck is possibly transport for a chief but provides little assistance in terms of gear and equipment apart from one tank and one tap that builds one grey extinguisher. Its a nice build for use of an old wheel arch with a small chassis spread across a plate with a blue steering wheel. The van cab rear window and roof sit on proper bricks at the back and the front is suitable for the 1980's style town sets with that classic chunky grill (also an MF ladder) in black. The doors are on and with two blue lights its really pretty good. The standard red hubcapped wheels make an overdosing of red that TLG never held back with where the fire service were concerned. It would actually stand out more in use with grey, black, white or yellow.</div><div><br></div><div>The centre piece is of course the fire engine. Using two small chassis on a black plate is a reminder of how useful those were when added together for extending vehicle design. Plates follow with a clip holding a grey axe (would Lego firemen not be better off with a brick remover tool?). The rear and front lights are added with blocks and a classic eight stud red brick for strength making a solid construction. The hatch is added, always a good gap filler, with a black grill, doors, more bricks, a reel of hose and the useful turntable. The beloved flat truck windscreen goes on with the hinged rear van window panel that holds the roof and the turntable gets more movement with a hinged eight stud plate. This enable the superb ladder to sit atop and be lifted and pointed to buildings, the entire bodywork sitting on large chunky tyres. A nice touch is that the grey hose nozzle is held by a headlight brick for tidyness.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the doors I believe they all had prints by now and those doomed square paper stickers were all but over. If it were not stored away in pieces I would be sure.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">						</span>Alternative Building</h4><p>It has a couple of decent alternative builds on the instructions which is a rarity, many alternates being awful but the main fleet here is complete and would satisfy any need for a brigade in a town collection or layout.&nbsp;One is a cleverly imagined crane and the other a 4x4 with trailer towed... go kart.&nbsp;In fact with the same bricks the truck and pick up could probably be converted in to a decent cab and trailer for a big engine.</p><div><b>Flaming Legacy</b></div><div>This was an early indicator of what was to come in future sets as the axe wielding, ladder climbing world of danger was built around increasing amounts of toolkit each year for the service. Its a really good set that had I believe, superior predecessors and more polished descendants. A probable favourite though, its presence is made by a strong central design and the less attractive part would be the pick up for want of a trailer.&nbsp;You may also need to increase the staff roster as firemen usually respond in large numbers.</div></div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
"peti7788","2021-11-03T12:38:27.113Z","Captain cheap","<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered <strong>smaller firefighting sets a good idea</strong>. Especially if parents didn&#39;t have the money to buy a large and expensive fire station.&nbsp;This set is also a good idea to get 3 vehicles and 3 minifigures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of the 3 vehicles, only the fire truck can really be used.&nbsp;The function of the other 2 vehicles is questionable.</p>

<p>Lego saved too much on the parts.&nbsp;For example, it would have been better to have 1 more sliding ladder so you could increase its distance. This way, a maximum of one cat can be rescued from the top of a tree.</p>

<p>The motorcycle is fine. First response unit. OK</p>

<p>But what about the other smaller&nbsp;car?&nbsp;What could it be? Fire chiefs car? Brush truck?&nbsp;It is too small and doesn&#39;t really have a function.</p>

<p>If we just rebuild this vehicle into a bigger pickup truck or a station wagon and get 1 extra ladder for the fire truck, it throws a huge amount of play&nbsp;value.&nbsp;<strong>Too bad Lego didn&#39;t think so</strong>.&nbsp;And it would only take about 10 extra parts.</p>
