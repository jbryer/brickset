"_Sam_","2022-10-12T12:38:02.4Z","Beautiful!","<p>This is a beautiful set, larger than it looks on the box, and a fun,&nbsp;engaging build with some great techniques. When building it does have the feel of a MOC rather than a regular set, but only in good ways, with stacks of details &amp; a more intricate dense build. It&#39;s one of&nbsp;those sets where every time you look at it a different detail catches your eye and draws you in.&nbsp;The build is complex in places,&nbsp;but the instructions are clear and easy to follow&nbsp;&amp; structurally everything holds together well. It&nbsp;comes across as a really quality model,&nbsp;and it looks fantastic&nbsp;on display.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of paying aftermarket prices for&nbsp;it though I&#39;d warn against it. The original Bricklink Designer Program sets (the Lowenstein castle round) were a thing of&nbsp;beauty, with slipcases, boxes with closing lids, spiral bound instructions &amp; an exclusive brick. The first round of the new wave (Castle in the Forest round) cut back on all that except at least the boxes still had closing lids. This latest round though even that has gone - the box here is the Lego basic side opening tape sealed type &amp; the only other thing in the box beside the pieces is a small card with a picture of the&nbsp;set on one side &amp; on the reverse&nbsp;notes on how to access the instructions online. It&#39;s sad to see how the packaging of the original program&nbsp;was so full of love, but for&nbsp;this round it is so basic. At RRP these are still fun sets to have &amp; offer a convenient way to get all the pieces together - but at&nbsp;aftermarket prices beware.</p>

<p>So a wonderful model&nbsp;- but if you want to build it consider just buying the&nbsp;parts because as tempting as the set might be the only difference the extra cost gets you is the minimal packaging.</p>
