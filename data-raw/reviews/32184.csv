Now it has arrived and unlike many other recipients of this set I decided to build it instead of trying to get some money out of it (I see a lot of sets being offered on secondary market). I don&#39;t think it will be considered an official modular building though.</p>

<p>The building experience for me personally wasn&#39;t so great. There is no instructions manual included and the recommended way to build is using the LEGO instructions app. I have an old ipad which refused to load the instructions as probably the file was too, so I had to make due with my smartphone. This wasn&#39;t ideal. So after a while I parked myself behind the pc and build the set via PDF instructions which can not be found via the official LEGO website, but&nbsp;only be&nbsp;on Bricklink. If you want the instruction in this format&nbsp;I recommend searching for &quot;LEGO instructions 910023 bricklink&quot;&nbsp;and find the appropriate link as the instructions are pretty impossible to find via the Bricklink site itself.</p>

<p>Building the set itself is pretty straight forward. Not anything sticking out on the techniques used, but there are some nice designs like the piano. One can definitely tell this is not an official LEGO designed set as there are quite some parts of this building which do not feel very solid. The bridge is not a very sturdy design and some of the&nbsp;windows are only connected on the bottom. Not very sturdy.</p>

<p>After the build the set itself looks good though. It is basically two modular buildings Venetian style&nbsp;build on two 32x32 baseplate with plenty of minifigs. Due to the colour of the pavement and the addition of the light blue waterways it might be a bit of work to integrate this into a LEGO city when you desire to do so, but as I am displaying this in a Detolf display cabinet and the set can be split into two separate buildings it is not a big deal. I do think they look best connected together though, and eventually I might have to find a different spot. Definitely somewhere without direct sunlight!</p>

<p>Overall I would rate this set 4 stars. It looks very good, but the building experience was a bit frustrating for me.&nbsp;</p>
