Pretty straightforward in construction and features but still a classic airplane.  As others have noted, more mini figures would be good (I think the plane has 3 seats but only 1 passenger, plus the pilot.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

the difference to the planes that come with 6392 and 6396 is the slightly heavier build - a few mor parts are involved, making the plane more solid, thereby not reducing it's elegance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Its easy to build ( if you dont get the pieces wrong like me) and takes you about 15 minutes. But that time is a prediction as i forgot. The minfigures are cool,but i got only with only one eye cus its 25 years old! Here are some pros and cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Flip up side</p>
<p>beuatiful&nbsp;desing</p>
<p>Easy to build</p>
<p>Fun to play with</p>
<p>To scale as it is only as small jet (mesured it with police seaplane)</p>
<p>Fits perfectly in a Lego City Airport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>NONE!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is amazing. I would give it a 5/5. If you think it sounds good buy it ASAP. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"albcheng123","2009-09-22T04:10:15.797Z","Designed to Last","I got the model when I was very young, and the set was my first aeroplane that has offered me lots of fun during my childhood.

Talking about the brick architecture, the ""Jet Airliner"" fully demonstrates the ""old school"" lego way.

Unlike the newly-designed aeroplanes (e.g. 7893: Passenger Plane), which are designed in the way that several big ""Shell pieces"" outlining the shape of an aircraft,  the old-school """"Jet Airliner"" offers lots of fun when building the cool aircraft model by around 150 brick pieces.

After the launching on ""Jet Airliner"" in 1985, similar ""building architecture"" were also adopted in the following sets until the latest ""Air Mail (7732)"":

Year: 1988
Med-Star Rescue Plane (6356)

Year: 1990
Trans Air Carrier (6375) 
International Jetport (6396) 

Year: 1994
Century Skyway (6597)

Year: 2003
Holiday Jet (Inflight) (4032)

Year: 2008
Air Mail (7732)

Pros:
- Classics Old-school brick architecture, offering lots of fun when building
- Cool aeroplane outlook
- Cool Pilot minifig
- 2 Turbine Engine bricks
- 2 pieces of Wing bricks
- Several streamlined brick pieces for constructing the plane
- 3 Airplane wheels

Cons:
- Better with more passenger minifigs (ideally with 2 or 3 passengers)
- Passengers and pilots can only enter the aeroplane by opening the roofs 


I can only use ""Designed to Last"" to describe this classical set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-03T15:14:48.12Z","Jet Airliner Review","<p>Can't say I can complain too much about this set, as I got it with part of a lot of Legos from an ebay auction while bidding for another set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plane is alright, a solid build and function. You get two minifigures, the pilot and a passenger. I suppose if you had a Lego Airport this'd fit in beautifully with it. It just feels out of place for me with no Airpot for it to land at properly.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

Just helicopters and a few non-swooshable aeroplanes. What a fussy kid. 1985 brought a few well designed jet aeroplanes across different sets. Passenger jets were an obvious place to start and made a &#39;proper&#39; aeroplane available to us. It may not be a fully satisfying design but it certainly has some merits, does not suffer from many modern large section bricks and is a fine place to start for collecting Lego aeroplanes. Starting from the ground up: The solitary passenger seems to have missed the flight (small jokes like this from TLG are fun).</span></span></span><br />

<span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">The double wheels were an exciting new piece featuring smooth tyres with a thin flat four stud plate to fix to the underside of any suitable build. The undercarriage area allows sadly no wheel retraction, admittedly difficult with the smaller jet aircraft, but features exciting diagonal sloped bricks. These under and over smooth chamfers where brick corners normally sat transformed vehicle design and made much sought after vehicles.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:.0001pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">The colour scheme looks pretty smart with a line of black and red sweeping through and up the fuselage and the excellent wing plates forming some essential aerodynamics. These are nicely finished with a red and green light for port and starboard. Past the nicely formed nose cone with those diagonal shaped pieces the blueish and rather flash windscreen features with a row of matching snap in window pieces down each side. This cabin does not make the greatest IZ (imagination zone) within but a row of seats makes room for further passengers. The thing is still only four studs wide, bless it.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:.0001pt""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"">One piece engines, love them or hate them? You can enjoy designs here and there that make a special Lego brick or piece that instantly describes an object and the engine is to my mind semi-necessary. Looking good enough for the size, the jets sweep back to leave the two piece tail to top off the whole design really well, especially with the black and red on white theme. As previously mentioned the roof is really nice with those slanted bricks that are hinged to access the cabin...no door, escape hatch or steps!</span></span></span></p>

Some crash landings and extra MF activity around it can make more fun of the model and it remains an original passenger jet.</span></span></span></p>
