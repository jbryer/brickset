The garage doors are superb, and the working car jack is fantastic also. One of my all time favourites!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"phoinix","2006-04-18T17:25:02Z","got it for free!","I got this set for free from a neighbour that didn't want it anymore. Knowing I am a huge Lego fan, he gave it to me! I really love it though the sliding garage door is now stuck and really difficult to open and close. Lego should make more small cute and useful sets like this one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-05-07T16:37:57.903Z","good workshop","This set comes with everything needed - a cool garage door in nice colours, lots of tool you need to repair the cars in your city and a minifig. Even a small bureau with phone is there, so it has all things needed for a long time playing fun and it is necessary to have some car repair in every city of course. With the 6363 a must-have :) 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It was excellent for its time and it still is, with the roller door, the detachable wheels on the car and the car jack which were all new features at that time. I'll give it a 9/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Anyhow, ebay as an adult led to my <i>finally </i>getting hold of one in 2007. Its a shame Lego waste their time making countless Emergency Services stuff for City now or their licensed dross - to me, Lego Town, Space, Castle of the 1980s as well as Technic or Fabuland even were far more interesting and imaginative. Its a shame to no longer see varied size affordable sets like this in toy departments of shops or toy store shelves in general now. I think this set is just great because it looks like it could be a small independent mechanics shop in any classic Town setting. It goes well with either Bike Repair Shop Lego did as well as the more modern Bike Shop they released along with the yellow bus, Pizzeria etc from 7641 City Corner. I also think 6610 Petrol Pumps would go nicely with this set, it certainly compliments the shell style oil drum that comes with the Auto Workshop and also would hark back to those small independent mechanics yards you used to see that had pumps, sold paraffin and did work on your car unlike the clone - like self service Petrol Stations we now have everywhere...",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5
"Count_Tofu","2013-07-04T18:49:08.117Z","Great set, great parts that were new at the time","I was about 10 or 11 when I got this set. My first set with a roller door! It also came with a car jack, a phone, tools and detachable wheels that were pretty new at that time, to me anyway. I really liked the oil drum in Shell colors too.<div><br></div><div>Some sets are nice to look at but this was great to play with. And if you had any other LEGO cars (I did) then of course it was great to combine with this repair shop.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
