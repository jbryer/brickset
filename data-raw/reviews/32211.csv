<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, my brother is a photographer, so picking up a model like this was a MUST. What I expected was nothing more than a block of bricks with some props, but I was shocked to find this set is fully articulated to feel like a real camera, down to the satisfying little &quot;click&quot; sound when you tap one of the faux-buttons. This camera, despite lack of many play features, goes out of its way to feel like a real camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The included bits are a piece of film (yes, it fits inside the film slot) and a lens cap (yes, it attaches to the lens). Because of the &quot;play features&quot; in this set, you can easily pack all of the parts together and safely move this set without a huge risk of losing parts. This set is also very structurally stable, since it uses a combination of brick-built elements and technic to hold the entire thing together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One point I need to dock from this set is the issue with the compartment door on the back. The back of this camera opens up like a real one, allowing you to place all your extra parts inside of it, and the door can be very hard to open without accidentally snapping two bricks off of the edge. I don&#39;t know if or how this could have been rectified, and my only real suggestion would be to have used an ingot brick underneath the slot to create a lip for you to get your finger inside of, which a company like Kodak would have inevitably added to the real camera.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, with the age of point-and-shoots, especially ones which use film, dying to the smartphone era, this set is a wonderful little blast from the past. It has the real heft of a camera and I can see a ton of children really enjoying playing pretend photographer with it, and it&#39;s such a fun build that it would look perfect in any camera enthusiast&#39;s collection. I was tempted to buy a second one for my brother before I saw the current aftermarket price of the model, and I&#39;m overjoyed knowing that I have at least one of these beauties in my personal collection.</p>
