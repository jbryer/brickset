<p>Sunflowers are &quot;composite&quot; flowers that are actually composed of hundreds of little flowers, and the natural studs of a LEGO plate make a&nbsp;perfect texture for the centre (&quot;er&quot;!) disk. Among the various flowers in the Botanicals line, these are among the most realistic.</p>

<p>The building techniques that Squirrell has used are clever (petals from paddles is just great) but unavoidably repetitious. That isn&#39;t a problem, though,&nbsp;because this is a &quot;pocket money&quot; set and comes together very quickly. I even split the building duties with my wife, so that we each only constructed one stem.</p>

<p>Speaking of stems, the only real flaw with this set is that the stems are too short. Sunflowers are known for their stature, and these examples barely fit into any of the vases that we have about, without mangling the cockpit pieces used as leaves. This is easily remedied, of course, by a trip to LEGO.com or Bricklink, but I do wish that there were a few more Technic stem pieces included in the box.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice, accessible addition to the Botanicals line that will be sure to add some colour (there is no &quot;u&quot;!) to a room or balance out a custom bouquet of LEGO flowers. Happy Spring!</p>
