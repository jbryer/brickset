"PerryThePlatypus","2022-01-07T18:48:58.58Z","A great starter to series 22","<p>A new year, a new unlicensed minifigure series. I&rsquo;ve had my mixed feelings about unlicensed series&rsquo;. There are some mixed bags and some I find mediocre with just a few standouts, however, I have generally positive opinions regarding series 22. Some ideas and especially the detailing of these figures have been stepped up, and I think the robot in particular is the epitome of said improvement.</p>

<p>Starting from the legs, they feature excellent mechanical details, the printing from the feet continuing to the sides looks especially seamless. The torso continues the great detailing, including print on the arm. The front has a symbol of a robot hand and the back has a hazard sign on it. The robot arm is used here in yellow, which I believe is a new color for it, and I love what they&rsquo;ve done here. You can attach the regular robo hand to it, but other options have been provided, you can also attach the hammer and drill, I absolutely love the customisation aspect of this. The head is in light gray and the face is a smile that&rsquo;s simultaneously cute and creepy with some excellent shiny gold detailing as well, the back of the head print also shows the battery level of the robot, which you can still see even with the helmet on. Speaking of which, the yellow mechanic helmet looks great, and I like the happy closed eyes printed on the visor. Finally, the accessories include a hammer, a drill piece to customise the robo arm and an adorable&nbsp;mini robot companion, I like the printed eyes and how you can move its little feet to have it walking.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure is one of my favourites of the series. The prints all around are fantastic and feels like a step-up from previous series&rsquo;. The different accessory options to attach to the robo arm is an awesome feature and the lil robot companion is such a good inclusion. I don&rsquo;t have any issues with this one, It&rsquo;s a very fun figure and I highly recommend it.</p>

"8BrickMario","2022-01-07T17:28:52.033Z","Takes one to fix one!","<p>The Minifigures line hasn&#39;t impressed me much of late. Fantasy and horror characters felt absent or not played interestingly enough, and I think some great character designs in those categories were misguidedly funneled into Vidiyo, leaving less exciting options in the series. Fortunately, Series 22 has some more out-of-the-box characters that, while perhaps a bit repetitive in spots, are certainly fun and exciting. This guy was one I had to have.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Robot Repair Tech is a pretty good parts pack. You get a torso with a robotic arm new in yellow, a new robot-printed minifigure head, a drill bit, a hammer, and a claw, and a red 1x2 Technic plate with two half-round robot eye tiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>The Robot Repair Tech not only repairs robots, but he is one, with an adorable industrial-pop design. His yellow and orange colors&nbsp;make him look modern and efficient, while his details and asymmetry lend him a humbler tone. He uses the new helmet-style welder&#39;s mask, which is printed with a black lens and two happy pixelated eyes. It makes him look very much like BURN-E from Pixar&#39;s&nbsp;<em>WALL*E,&nbsp;</em>which means he&#39;s adorable. I prefer to view the mask as his actual face, though there is one under the mask, with a grey minifigure head and a cute robot face as well as a battery-charge symbol on the back, positioned so it&#39;s visible in the gap left by the mask. I wish the head had been yellow to create a more consistent design unmasked, as nothing else on his body is grey enough and it makes his body look more like a costume. The graphic design on the Tech&#39;s body is unusually flat, being blocked out with solid colors and not being defined with black outlines. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s not an approach I&#39;m used to with LEGO. His torso features one robot arm, which can accommodate a black claw, a hammer, or a drill bit. It&#39;s beyond time for LEGO to produce torsos with two of these arms and a handybot like this would have been a great place to start, but if you buy two, you can make it happen on your own. I&#39;m not sure if the asymmetrical hand colors work for me or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tech&#39;s little robot buddy is an adorable little construction of a head and feet. It&#39;s a neat addition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is a really fun character concept and design. There are a few elements I would change, but I&#39;m overall glad to have him.</p>

"Pollywanna","2022-07-13T21:18:47.113Z","Adorable duo, couple of minor issues","<p>As soon as I saw this pair I knew I needed to get them - a pair of wonderfully colourful robot friends to contrast again all the drab grey and black robots we&#39;ve been getting out of Lego for years, and a unique, hard-edged industrial aesthetic to boot, with that wonderful reuse of the welder&#39;s helmet for a big, square, heavy-jawed robot head. He&#39;s covered in printing, most of it is well done but there tends to be some blurriness around the feet where it looks like the side and front printing overlap slightly, but it&#39;s not as bad as some of the other figures in this series. What really lets him down fo me is the robot arm - it&#39;s great, the issue is that he only has one. I had to pick up two of him to make sure he got two matching arms, and it really rounds out the look so much, adding that finishing touch to the industrial aesthetic and the look of mechanical strength he has that separates him from other Lego robots. His little companion is just perfect, and with the generous addition of a couple of tools, this feels much more substantial than the usual CMF - it could almost be a polybag, it&#39;s a complete play experience in and of itself. One of the best CMFs in a very long time, just wish they&#39;d included two robot arms for the big guy.</p>

"Th3_3m3rald_M1n3cart","2023-02-11T00:58:59.737Z","Maybe the Best Series 22 Minifigure","<p>So series 22 was pretty good in terms of an original LEGO collectable Minifigure series. He has excellent torso and leg printing, and the use of the welders mask for his head is genius. I also like how he has a separate head print underneath that harkens back to late 90s space minifigures. He also has arm printing, which is always a bonus! I also like how they&#39;ve included a unicorn horn from Unikitty that can be swapped out with his claw hand to make a drill. But of course, I&#39;m just beating around the bush and we need to acknowledge the best part... the little robot side companion. It&#39;s just a simple build with a clip, some 1x1 plates with clips, and two 1x1 curved tiles with eye prints. The design is extremely effective and the robot looks incredibly cute. Overall, a very good minifigure that is definitely one of the highlights of Series 22. He&#39;s also very useful because he can easily fit in to any sci-fi related display, even Star Wars!</p>

<p>This minifigure exhibits intricate details, that are luckily, on every possible surface. It features an array of accessories that are useful (And understandable) for the character.</p>

<p>The Minifigure<img alt="""" src=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/photos/share/jXU2ECJV9f2Z4em78kqDJbMWXTiDMlnSt8m9SZwyc3p"" /></p>

<p>The minifigure is mainly yellow, with orange highlights on the bottom (And on the side of) the feet, some (Which I infer are screws) dotted around on the helmet, chest, and on the normal arm. The helmet is the welder mask in bright yellow, and it has a black screen with 2 pixelated closed eyes which makes it look very pleased with itself, and underneath it has a grey standard minifigure head that has gold circuitry printed all around a face with blue processors and under there is a smile which is not necessary for an industrial grade machine. At the back there is more circuitry and an icon displaying the battery level, which is fortunate to be high. The torso features a printed plate with a Lego claw insignia on it and another on the other side with an electrical sign and a charging port. It has one normal minifigure arm that has good old side arm printing and an orange hand. The other arm, however, is more heavy looking and can fit a bar through it. The accessories included are a claw, and a unicorn horn in silver, that is meant to be a drill of sorts. The legs are printed all around, so they are appreciable.c</p>

<p>The accessories</p>

<p>This minifigure, along with the arm options features a few accessories that are appropriate for the character. First, a plain black hammer that can be connected to the robo arm but is not advertised. Secondly, it has a little robot thing, and it uses good parts, and they are in uncommon colours and some printed semicircles that have blue eyes on it, that are useful for M.O.Cs&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict</p>

<p>This minifigure is very detailed and lives up to the standard set by greater minifigures and is definitely the best of the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BUT&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps minifigures like this are declining in value. What if all of your generic minifigures are covered in detail, like it is just something to be on every character there is, a standard like head printing? I&#39;m not saying that will be bad, but it would definitely be odd, and maybe it is closer to us than we think......</p>

<p>Just something to ponder...</p>
