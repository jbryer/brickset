"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-08T14:51:31Z","One house","When I read the comments, I realise how lucky I am to own this set. I was too young but my syster bought it and gave it to me (I must admit, she was a little bit forced ^^)
I really this set because it is the unique house I have in my town (which is full of police officers and trains).
I hope LEGO to release set like this one somdays.
Or maybe I will create some hou&#232;ses with this house designer set...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Its a nice living house which are too rare in Legoland, it even has cupboards and tiny furniture which i think were invented in this set. design is nice, even a painting on the wall is there. Makes 5/5 for this one.

The chimney is pretty cool and makes this house detailed. This is so good that Lego should rerelease this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This red house has a tiny, but very cosy kitchen. There's an opening window, some sort of a drawer, an oven and some kitchen utensils. In the right part of house there is a dining-room with a painting at the wall.

The second floor includes a bedroom and a study with a small closet.

Outside You can see two chairs, a table, a stove, some flowers, a tree and a lantern. Good details for anyone, who wants to create a peaceful community of householders in their Lego Town.

The figures include a man and his wife. These two have rare clothes, the style of 1980s (I really like it), the girl has red hair, that are really hard to find now. The guy owns a red bike as well.

I already have a collection of several houses, including 6349, and this one fits nicely into my street. It's an awesome set indeed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
