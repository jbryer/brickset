<p>The Figure Skating Champion is, for me, greatly sentimental due to its numbering in terms of sets I have acquired. The Minifigure however, I would say is not bad, but not the Champion of the CMF series.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a hairpiece introduced in 2021 in a yellow colour, his face features a large grin with some glitter detail, his torso has further glittering on its light blue base, and the legs are unprinted in the same blue colour.</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The only accessories per-say are a pair of silver ice skates, which are expected and inevitable. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1&times;2 black jumper plate and an action pose piece, so the figure can be on the stand with the skates on.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a mind-blowing Minifigure, I&#39;m afraid to say I&#39;m sick of the winter sports/performance Minifigures I CMF series, the trope has been done to death. The hair and torso are nice elements, but they don&#39;t save the figure. But, completionists have this figure already, and if you want it, I see no issue with recommending this to anyone who is even partially interested, you won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>
