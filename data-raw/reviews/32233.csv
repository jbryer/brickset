"SleeplesSSP","2022-05-11T20:24:14.467Z","Basically a World of Warcraft Elf","<p>When I first saw this, I saw a striking similarity between her and the Night Elves from World of Warcraft. The glaring connection is the heavy use of moon-themed imagery and purple armour, and it wouldn&#39;t take much modification if you were fulfilling your Blizzard-based LEGO dreams that were never fulfilled after the death of Overwatch LEGO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love the night protector&#39;s translucent weaponry, and the purple sword is easily one of the most valuable pieces in Series 22 for me, even more than the easy-to-access horse and dog. Her dark cyan hair is also striking against her bright blue face, and the purple-with-silver mail armour is a great design, especially with that cute little gem in the middle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This lady will be a great addition to my mediaeval collections and I seriously hope some sort of &quot;not Warcraft&quot; night elves pop into existence within the fantasy world of LEGO Castles. Great set, best one in the series for me.</p>

"8BrickMario","2022-09-22T23:37:51.237Z","Specific tones, yet wide applications","<p>This figure is really interesting to me because I feel like other people&#39;s reactions to her are to find that she reminds them of different things. I thought her parts were interesting and happened to get two of her by random picks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Night Protector has some interesting colorful parts that bridge fantasy and sci-fi. Her hair is new in teal, and it&#39;s always nice to see more heads in Aqua. The design is suitably ethereal to work for fairies or ghosts or other such creatures. Her torso and legs depict a unique armor pattern with purple tones, which could have multiple uses, and she has a translucent purple shield with a moon pattern and a translucent purple sword which feel cosmic and magical.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to interpret this character. Series 22 has a few out-of-the-box characters that aren&#39;t typical of the minifigure series, which could be a sign of dwindling ideas...or a sign that things will get more experimental and creative. I&#39;ve seen people comparing her to elf races from fantasy video games, and her moon and branch imagery does allow her to be taken a bit more seriously in a full fantasy setting, with her colors perhaps stylizing her to make her evoke the night she is active in.</p>

<p>But when I saw her, the Night Protector gave me strong Masters of the Universe vibes, what with her colorful, toyetic, facially&nbsp;sculpted, vaguely eighties take on the medieval fantasy genre. I can very easily see her fighting alongside shirtless barbarian princes and animal-themed superhero sorcerers to fight against&nbsp;giant head-shaped stone villain lairs painted neon green. But that&#39;s just what I read into her design. In truth, that&#39;s not a niche of media I grew up with or care about very much, so my interest in the figure is mostly in her parts. Her face, with its smug severe female features, would be really good for ghostly characters, and her silver freckles or glitter dust on her face don&#39;t really limit her that much because the head really works only for ethereal characters anyway. Her armor is nice and gender-neutral and her fantasy weapons are fun pieces that could have varied applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>

<p>If LEGO&#39;s Minifigure designs are going to make a shift to the less conventional or more niche in order to continue the theme, I don&#39;t really mind because it gives us interesting characters and parts like this one does. The Night Protector is not my favorite character, but she has some interest and fairly wide uses for something that feels so targeted.</p>
