I eventually got the two I was after, and I considered my business with this series done.<br />
<br />
But then I started seeing more and more people post their pictures of little Forest Elf - in MOCs, in natural settings outdoors, wherever, and I slowly started to see why people liked the little guy. But by this point, the series had been retired and replaced, and aftermarket prices were higher than I would have liked to pay.<br />
<br />
I finally found a little independent toy shop near me that still had some of the old series left, and this time I was feeling the bags specifically for him. Finally managed it and I was ecstatic - he really is just too cute a figure for words, and the mushroom dish (and the extra as standard) are lovely parts to have. I was especially lucky with mine, which cape with a spare oak leaf cape too. The simple yet subtle printing on the torso and the cheeky little face really ties the whole things together, but the star is of course that lovely little acorn hat. The whole ensemble is just wonderful and ties in with whatever other fantasy figures you may have, or standalone, as a life-size tiny little forest imp.</p>
