Fortunately, the Bird Watcher avoids this problem where the figure and the new animal piece are equally great.</p>

<p>Starting with the dual-molded legs, they&rsquo;re dark tan pants and brown boots with great side prints for pockets. The torso is pretty simple with a black shirt that has shirt pockets and the arms are dual-molded with the left one having a print of a smartwatch. The researcher comes equipped with a pink satchel, which I believe is a new color, and it&rsquo;s a really cool piece to get. The face prints feature a sincere open smile and a more neutral smile, I particularly like the first face and how expressive it is. The hair/hat combo is the ponytail/hat combo piece that has consistently appeared in unlicensed CMF series&#39;s for a while now, this time with black hair and a teal hat. Finally, 3 accessories accompany the researcher, including plant foliage piece that the toucan can rest on, which was a cool addition, binoculars in dark green (recolor of this common piece is much appreciated!), and the awesome new toucan which absolutely nails it in every regard, the printing and the mold in general is fantastic!</p>

<p>Overall, I think it&rsquo;s easy to see why the bird watcher is one of the best of series 22. The superb new toucan, the phenomenal detail and prints all around and the awesome recolors of existing pieces culminate to a fantastic figure that I have no issues with. And I&rsquo;m beyond happy that the new animal piece doesn&rsquo;t overshadow the figure itself, and they&rsquo;re both great and interesting in&nbsp;their own right. Would highly recommend picking this figure up.</p>
