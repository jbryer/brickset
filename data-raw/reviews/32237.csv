The logo here is printed much thicker, and there&#39;s a strange purple outline around the edge of it, almost like it&#39;s a decal or something. All of the minifigs in this series suffer from similar issues with the printing not being as sharp as is usual, which is unacceptable given the increase in retail price for them, but here it&#39;s especially glaring because you can&#39;t integrate the torso with your other Classic Space figures without this issue jumping out at you. As nice as it usually is to get a Classic Space torso in a new colour, in this instance, I would have much preferred getting a brand new design.</p>
