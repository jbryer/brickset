The shop is simple but quite realistic with the large windows and door, cash machine and cans of oil on the wall. The car raising platform instead is not designed well, it takes a lot of optimism to assume a car could mount and dismount from it. The pumps are limited but really nice with the pistol and its hanger.

The design of the tow truck is perhaps the weak spot of the set, the excessive shortness and the small wheels make it look a bit pathetic. The car design is basic but certainly better, with an opening front panel (after all, this car is probably here for a check). The motorcycle (with rare windshield) is a very nice addition.

In general this is a basic but very nice-looking gas station. The (perhaps unique) road baseplate makes it immediately placeable into a town setup.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It uses a baseplate that is unique to this set, and which fits perfectly all the other old road plates without bicycle lanes (1978-1985).<br><br>The ""Shell"" designs provides a very realistic touch, but my favourite is the grey car lift, which offers great playability.<br>The blue car is equipped with a ""headlight"" brick right behind the right door. This makes it possible to ""put fuel into"" the car, a nice little detail.<br>In contrast to that, the tow truck looks way too small.<br><br>Parts: 6431 was one of the first sets to contain trans-clear round 1x1 bricks.<br>Nearly all other parts are basic or standard parts used in the early 80ies.<br><br>I really like this set, it is not as big as 6382 or 6384, but it is essential for every classic Lego town setup.<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,4
