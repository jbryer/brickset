&nbsp;&nbsp;Minifigure:</p>

<p>&nbsp; Hoth Rebel&nbsp;Officer; I am assuming this is an officer due to the slight differences in his appearance and rank badge than his fellow rebel troopers. He&#39;s wearing the topical Hoth Rebel hat with goggles. His face is double-sided with a calm expression on one side and an angry expression on the other. His torso is printed with a tan padded vest over a white shirt. With a rank indicator on the left side of his vest.&nbsp;His legs are plain white. He carries a blaster rifle.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Hoth Rebel trooper male; he also wears the typical Hoth Rebel hat and goggles. His face is double-sided&nbsp;with darker skin tone and beard and a happy smile on one side of&nbsp;his face, and an angry expression on the other. His torso is printed with a white jacket and belt with pouches and silver cylinders and a rank indicator. His legs are white with a tan stripe printed between his boots and pants. He carries white macrobinoculars and a blaster rifle.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Hoth Rebel Trooper female; she is also wearing the traditional Hoth hat with goggles. Her face is wearing a serious expression. Her torso is printed the same as the male Hothh trooper. Her&nbsp;legs are also printed the same way. She carries a blaster rifle.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The builds for this set are somewhat interesting. First you build two laser cannons that use blaster guns as stands. Then you build two battery packs for the cannons. Then you build a P-tower turret.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall a great set to increase your Hoth Rebel forces in the face of an Imperial attack.&nbsp;</p>

The 2 separate built guns are a pretty ugly design for the base, but the main cannon looks good, however I believe the base was built using guns to make up for the years of stud shooters in battlepacks, so I can forgive them for this. The dish turret is quite small, but it gets the point across well. I suggest getting at least one of these before it retires.</p>
