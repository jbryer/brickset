It was decided off a poll on which franchise should get the 150th brickhead and it was between Star Wars, Jaws, Minecraft, and Lilo and Stich. Star Wars obviously won. On the box the brick denoting which number brickhead it is is coloured in gold. Ashoka is in her mandalorian clothes as this brickhead is of her during the siege of Mandalore. It pretty accurately depicts Ashoka during her season 7 clone wars arc which it is based off of. This is a good brickhead to pickup however it is a Lego store exclusive.</p>
