"chief7575","2022-01-21T14:11:49.143Z","Not so charming series of DOTS","<p>Picked up 5 packs of the newest line of DOTS, series 6 recently.&nbsp; I think this is the weakest entry into the line so far.&nbsp; I have a 7 yr old daughter who loves these packs and the cool things you can get out of them.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Decorated faces/symbols/prints on the tiles, etc are fun, as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>New Trans neon green quarter&nbsp;circle - awesome!</li>
	<li>New circle with the loop is interesting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Charms are ok - but you are only given 2 different kinds, having so many repeats gets old real quick</li>
	<li>Charms can ONLY be used on the new loop part</li>
	<li>Tile distribution in 5 packs was horrendous.&nbsp; Managed to get all 16 prints, but only had 1 print of 3 of them.&nbsp; That&#39;s unlucky.</li>
	<li>blue/pink/lavender half tiles and dots seem repetitive from earlier dots offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Charms are REALLY difficult to connect to the loop.&nbsp; My daughter was getting very frustrated by this and it was even difficult for myself to snap them on.&nbsp; Plus, after you have a couple, who needs 10+ of each??&nbsp; More variety of the charms would have been welcomed and a different color of the new circle w loop too .</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall - pretty MEH from me on this series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wish Lego put all of the printed dots in each bag but these are supposed to have an element of surprise to see which dots you got.&nbsp; In fact, Lego doesn&#39;t even show all of the printed dots available in the promotional pictures on the set page of their website.&nbsp; It&#39;s a real sore spot with me.&nbsp; Luckily, there is a clear window on the front of the bag that lets you preview what&#39;s inside.&nbsp; I&#39;m extremely grateful for the window to pick a bag that can get me most of what I want.</p>

<p>My bag contained two alien faces, two avacado-looking animals, and one of each of the following: sleeping/drooly face, smiley face, stuffed-cheeks face, snapping fingers, doughnut face, starfish face, banana, and the &quot;ciao!&quot; word bubble.&nbsp; The bright blue, purple, green and lavender tiles that make up the bulk of this set can add a lot of colour to your space MOCs.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>I&#39;m recommending this set to any AFOL who enjoys the printed faces and details that come in the Dots sets.&nbsp; They really are quite fun.&nbsp; I&#39;d also recommend this to girls for the charms.</p>
