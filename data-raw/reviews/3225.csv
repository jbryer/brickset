"Doyman","2007-06-05T11:51:06.39Z","Best house at the time","When I was young I had this set and thought it was da bomb, not because of what it was, but because of what it had.  This was the first set I had that came with mail, and a mailbox.  Stickers for a stove, mugs, a pitcher for ice tea etc.  Also the minifigs had hair and not hats.  Back then it seemed like the vast majority of figs had hats, so to have more &quot;hair&quot; around was good for variety.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Good use of colours and high playability. Adds some nice harmonic touch to every city, thats why this is a 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Sebastian","2009-10-09T03:40:50.293Z","The Home of Glass","This Set is extremely picturesque with its three small windows and the roof design. The white pieces of furniture and especially the glass jars, lamps and the precious carafe really add a touch of luxury to the house. The set communicates simple beauty.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Chaz777","2009-06-21T13:51:39.34Z","More of a Holiday home, really","Now, I don't usually do a pros and cons list, but for this set, you can see it's a house, that's pretty obvious, and there is only so much you can say about a house in a few paragraphs without just listing it's features, so I'm cutting out the middleman and just giving you two clear lists. Enjoy!

Pros

Clean, crisp design
Two minifigures
SIX bouquets of flowers
Big, full-length windows
Four cups, and an ingenious way to make a jug
Outdoor barbeque pit is well designed
Two clear downstairs rooms- a kitchen and a dining room
Good sized bedroom with a bedside table, two beds and nice windows
Kitchen has gas rings on the worktop and a shelf on which to store a glass
A lamp in the bedroom and on the dining rom table
Early design parasol
Nice sturdy chimey
Letterbox with two letters
Four chairs, two of them swivel
Plenty of roof bricks
Alternate models you might actually want to use in a town

Cons

The kitchen unit has a sticker across two 2x4 bricks, so once its stuck, you can't use the bricks again

So there's the list, hopefully it has helped you decide whether to start searching for this set or not, and if you want to see the instructions for an even better idea of what to expect, go to (sorry, I can't do links) peeron.com and searh for 6372.
And, if you hadn't guessed, I love this set. Get looking!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
