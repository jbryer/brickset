The color scheme is cool and the decal parts add nice details that raise this score from a 4 for me. The side car is a smart design and the flags on the roof are great as well. I wish I had the motorcycle windshields still. LEGO had the right idea producing small sets like this. i just wish that I had more sets like this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"villicus","2008-05-07T16:49:32.263Z","wonderful set","Although the building seems to be quite simple, it contains lots of details. Nice window-door-front, cool coloured helmets and of course three (!) motor cycles. One of the best sets lego made at that time. Get it, its worth the money. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Chaz777","2008-10-11T04:55:48.7Z","If I could only have one lego set, this would be it...","Well, I must say, never before has lego created something so simple, yet so beatiful. It really does encapsualate the ideals of lego. But really, I could just write a 10 page piece of poetry full of moving adjectives and stupidly romantic fellings, but no- one wants that, so lets get down to the hard facts.

First of all, when built, it looks good. Plonk it down in any town or display, and the simple red and yellow design stands out. Second of all, for those of you who like to play with your lego, you can. The figures are so simple and vague, anything is possible. Also, the fact that the sign on top is just a motorbike also lets your imagination do the thinking. Is it a garage, with a grease monkey, complete with tools, tinkering with his three bikes all day? Is it a very exclusive bikers club where the leather jacket wearing leader only lets the best riders in? Could it be a vintage bike museum, with all the tools and equipment from yesteryear waiting to be admired? Or is it a simple motorcycle shop, the centerpiece of your town, and the pride of your lego collection.
I should probably wrap this up now, before I really start to ramble, but first, I should really mention how the varied array of pieces means virtually unlimited alternate models, too. I actually picked this set on eBay, due to the fact that this wonderful set was released about 10 years before I was even born, and It was probably my best decision. If you see a boxed version, bite the sellers hand of and bag yourself a piece of legoey greatness that I suspect will never be equalled. Which leads me to the somewhat obvious statement- RE-RELEASE THIS SET LEGO!

Oh and in case you were in any dout, a solid 12 ou of 10 from me.

"SgtSmash","2010-11-05T12:58:14.323Z","One of the greats from the 1980's!","<p>The Motorcycle Shop was&nbsp;one of the greatest sets that Lego had created back in the heyday of the 1980's. While Lego seems to be experiencing a renaissance of sorts and have become more popular today than ever before, one must look back at a time when Lego had great and original ideas such as this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have fond memories of this set&nbsp;back when I&nbsp;originally got&nbsp;it as a gift when I was 13&nbsp;in 1984. There really are no weak points whatsoever here.&nbsp;Simple, yet fun.&nbsp;And while the design of Lego motorcycles have changed over the years, the bikes that come with this set are still&nbsp;fun, look great,&nbsp;and Lego was thoughtful enough to give three different colors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had any complaint whatsoever, it's the ""sidecar"" for the red motorcycle. It's a bit on the cheesy side, and falls off somewhat easily. Plus, the passenger rides on top of it, not in it. But&nbsp;Lego hadn't come up with a different mold for a sidecar, and would improvise.&nbsp;But that's the only thing I can come up with as any kind of downside. Today, I'm sure Lego would use the motorcycle&nbsp;sidecar design from one of the Indiana Jones sets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interior of the shop is simple, with an office which features a desk, spinning chair and telephone. There's a wrench in there for repairs, a ""showroom"" spot for one of the cycles as well as matching colored helmets on display for sale. The stickers that came with the set also were excellent. The main sign with the big red motorcycle is subtle, not sure what else they would have used,&nbsp;but no doubt done for&nbsp;universal appeal. I love the door stickers. The flags for the roof also were a great touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've made a point in a lot of my reviews how todays' sets do not mate right up to road plates without some improvising. The one thing I love about the old sets is they were designed to fit just about anywhere in your town without the need to buy anything extra just to&nbsp;attach them to roads,&nbsp;and make it look clean. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 26 years, I bought this set&nbsp;again,&nbsp;this time off of Ebay and in pretty good condition.&nbsp;It fits perfectly amongst today's buildings. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2010-10-16T10:20:21.593Z","Motor Cycle Shop Review","<p>A cousin of mine had this set growing up. I remember going over to his place and we'd play with this set along with others before I started my own lego collection. Alas, by the time I start collecting, this set was already gone and it wouldn't be til years later when I picked it up off E-bay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's everything I remember from growing up. A simple design that fulfills the function of this set, motorcycles of different colors that you usually don't get from other sets. There's a charm to still be had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure about a rerelease of this set, but it would allow others a chance to get a hold of this set for their collections.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Count_Tofu","2013-07-04T19:07:10.34Z","Nice set, some cool details","To me as a kid this set did not really stand out to me. I think it was because I liked LEGO cars and helicopters way more than bikes...<div><br></div><div>But all in all, it is a nice set with some cool details. Three different colored motorcycles, two even have windscreens (I think those are pretty rare). It has double doors - one opening left, the other right which I had not seen before. Great for building any other kind of store.</div><div><br></div><div>You have an office and some cool stickers - I think I liked the tiny opening-hours sticker on the door even more then the big cycle on top! I just really like those details. Two minifigs, the flags and some flowers really finish it up nicely.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
"Niki124","2023-02-19T20:01:02.293Z","Loved this set","<p>The last big set I had as a child, this was a good satisfying build, as expected from its size. But the obvious draw for me was the moulded motorcycles. Having had mixed experiences of the brick-built motorbikes of earlier sets, these were a very welcome innovation and became a firm favourite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bricks in the building and the interior display give a good variety for creativity and alternative builds, and the display of helmets came in very useful whenever any of our astronaut minifigures broke a chin-strap. Overall, this was a much-appreciated set which gave hours of fun, whether in its original form or in our more creative endeavours.&nbsp;</p>
