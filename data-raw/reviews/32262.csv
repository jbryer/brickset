The food truck is quite substantial and opens in an interesting way, with lots of nice details (LOVE the spinning taco!). The two stalls add a good variety of food pieces for your hungry minidolls to choose from, sadly the sushi platter (not the roll) is a sticker. The juice stand has an amazing blender too. I appreciate the fact that the pink used is not so in-your-face, and am glad to see Lego toning it down for the Friends line. The signage is great, the variety of utensils is great, the diversity of the minidolls is great, and I like how the consistency of the flower pots brings all the pieces together nicely. I could easily see making more stalls and trucks myself for a really fun larger food truck festival!</p>

<p>There are a few stickers, but I don&#39;t apply stickers. I think even without them the idea of the plates, menus and signs gets across, and it doesn&#39;t look bare or sparse. The price is a little high, though you do get a lot of pieces but many of them are very, very small. I also find it weird there is no stud in the bowls, so the sushi can fly out easy!</p>
