<p>Available at the lego store are&nbsp;these creator postcards. They are&nbsp;like mini&nbsp;architecture builds.&nbsp;The Beijing one looked bad, Paris was OK, London was nice but for a bit more you can get the architecture version (21034)&nbsp;with a better&nbsp;London Eye and a London bridge!&nbsp;</p>

<p>New York, New York!&nbsp;The minifig Statue of Liberty alone is almost worth the price of admission, pity the minifig can&#39;t hold the torch higher. But the minifig looks brilliant. The micro USA flag is a nice piece to have for other builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bridge is built on a turntable 2x2, so it has a nice 3d effect and also saves space on the build. The cab is a nice touch, although it&#39;s a bit hidden on the bridge. It works best when u approach or look at the build from the side.&nbsp;What I&nbsp;assume is the ferry, is just too small and&nbsp;looks more like a tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quite some small stickers need to be pasted on the skyscrapers. The manual is missing an instruction between steps 46 and 47. Sticker no.5 needs to be pasted on the highest block of the Empire State Building. Fired up by this I thought I found another mistake with the one world trade stickers, but it&#39;s not, it just looks that way because half the sticker is transparent.</p>

<p>The build is divided in two: the background and the&nbsp;scenery, and it is&nbsp;quite straight forward.The result is very nice,&nbsp;doesn&#39;t take up much space and yet is instantly recognizable. Definitely a nice little build.</p>

"tmdguru500","2022-11-19T23:26:32.953Z","Quick build and good for display","<p>I bought this set because I wanted something for a quick build and a set that I could put on display at home, and because I like postcards. I guess this set satisfied all these criteria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build....took me less than an hour. It was easy and good fun, especially when you&#39;re recreating the New York buildings and skyline. Quite fun for having the Statue of Liberty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, the postcard is now on display at home in the living, so it&#39;s a good addition to my home.&nbsp;</p>
