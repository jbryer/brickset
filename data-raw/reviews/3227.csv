"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-08T08:31:59Z","The Best House","Lego houses are an essential part of any town and are a cheerful alternative (or compliment) to the various emergency and race subthemes.  A great example of classic town, this set used to be my older sister's before it was assimilated into my much larger lego collection;)  
Gotta love the stone driveway and the architecture of the roof, carport and retractable awning over the patio.  No juniorization here, just lots of small bricks making up a classic design.  Have a BBQ out on the patio, or cook inside in the kitchen overlooking the carport.  There's also a living room on the ground floor as well as a king-sized lego bed upstairs.  Also has some nice, rare pieces like the big tree, '74' address over the door, and the white rails for the awning.  Not to mention lots of red roof bricks and even some skylights.
This set brings up the property value in any lego town!

If you like lego houses, this is the one to have...

There are several interesting features to this set, from the barbeque pit to the awning to the roof, there are many details that add realism to this house, although I do find that the rooms in the 2nd storey a little to small, but nevertheless the design of the roof is ingenious and the colour is definitely one of the best matched around.
