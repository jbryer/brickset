<p><strong>The Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This was an alright build, nothing too exciting, but that&#39;s what I&nbsp;expected for such a small set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set has 2 minifigs (with kid legs)&nbsp;both with rucksacks and the same legs (I don&#39;t mind, I&nbsp;quite like the colour!) the torsos are nice, but not unique to this set. One of them has a helmet, but the set incudes an extra hair piece for him. There is also a green frog and a skateboard, as well as an apple.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>The builds are a roundabout and a skateboard ramp. The roundabout can fit the 2 minifigs and spins nicely, it looks fine, but it can be hard to tell what it is. The skateboard ramp also looks&nbsp;good, with a lamp, fountain and flowerbed in the back. The skateboard doesn&#39;t quite fit on the ramp (hence the low playability rating) and takes up most of it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a good set, but not without issues. I rate it 8/10, mainly because it was a free gift a while back&nbsp;and for the price I bought it for it was good value. The minifigs are probably the best part of this for most people, but the builds are nice for a park scene, especially when combined with other sets.</p>
