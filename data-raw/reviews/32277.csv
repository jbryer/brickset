<p>A recognisable shape and one or two functions seems to be about the limit, and that&#39;s what this set delivers; it&#39;s obviously a front loader, and as well as rolling it can lift its bucket, using a &#39;hand-of-god&#39; gear on the roof. You can even tip the bucket.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a green beam under the hood and two orange cheese graters to make it look like a Volvo (and a sticker with the name printed on it just to be sure).</p>

<p>For &euro;4 there&#39;s a good bit of play fun in this set but I have to say I was a little disappointed that it doesn&#39;t steer.</p>
