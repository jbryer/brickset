"MatrixQuest","2007-11-26T22:12:14.25Z","Childhood remembered","This was my first Lego city building and the foundation of memories on which I build my new town.  For it's time I thought it was the best made set lego had.  the lift for car repairs is a throw back to actually filling up and tire changes at the same place.  All the features were fun including the spare tire rack.  The desk just inside the large pane glass window is an element I truly miss...bring back those windows please...  the only thing I disliked and couldn't figure out is still a pain to this day...why include flowers in a set that is all concrete???  The cars had brick elements with holes on the side for filling up that gave it more playability.  My all time favorite aspect was the legoland map of the roads that appeared on the wall behind the checkout.  In the form of a sticker it is the thing I miss most.  When I used to arrange my few road plates...it was always to match some section of the map.  Ahhhh, memories...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I found it in my garage a few weeks ago, and it wasn't missing anything other than the cowboy's actual torso piece. The set includes a Red Car, a Yellow Car, four gas pumps, a gas station, and a nifty little auto repair lift. 

    The Cars included in this set are nothing big, but lego did better with cars in the 80's then they do now. They have reverse-opening hoods, opening doors, and some colored headlights. The red car has a yellow chair, and the yellow car has a red chair. With just some cleverly placed pieces, you can even turn it into a fire car. ( You can practically modify any lego car to the point 

   The station is just a regular building. It has a small register room, but other than that, there is nothing else inside the buildings. However, the exterior is very exotic. There is a tower on one side of the set that has some labels on it. Underneath the tower, there are two gas pumps, each of which has a small string connecting the pump and to the removable car. as well as that, there are a few bits of machinery that are used to help the cars. One of them looks like a air pump and the other a spare tire holder. There are two flowers on the corner of the set, too. On the side of the road that has the main building there is another tower with an ""Exxon"" sign. The roof falls off easily but its nothing a few 1 by 1's can't fix. Also on the roof of the building there is a ""Happy Motoring"" sign. The white bordering on the roof matches the pumps, signs, and walls, as well.

    On one end of the baseplate, there is a repair rack where you can lift a car high enough for a mini figure to stand underneath. The only problem is that the rack lifts the car behind the wall, so it can hardly be used. 

    This set incorporates two baseplates, one of which is a standard 32 X 32 plate with a road and the other is a 32 X 8 baseplate both connected with the building and the car rack.

    Overall, this set gets a 4.5 out of 5 because of some very, very minor problems, however, this set is an excellent set and if you ever get a chance, buy it! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SgtSmash","2010-06-29T16:43:29.74Z","Best Gas Station ever","I remember when I first started collecting the Lego city sets way back in 1980-1981, one of the first sets I got was this Lego Exxon station. I played with this set quite a bit, and having a town full of cars, they needed gas and repairs, so where else do you go? <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Looking back, this set had it all. You had what appeared to be your full-serve/self-serve pump islands,&nbsp;the little oil can stand, building with cash register and a cool map of Lego Town on the wall, repair area with tools,&nbsp;an ACTUAL ROAD PLATE (!), cars, Exxon&nbsp;workers and a really&nbsp;cool Cowboy businessman minifig. This&nbsp;cowboy with the black hat was my town villain (come on, everybody had to have a town villain!).&nbsp;I think this was because of the hit&nbsp;American TV&nbsp;show&nbsp;of the time, ""'DALLAS"". JR&nbsp;Ewing was the&nbsp;most&nbsp;evil man on television.&nbsp;I had more fun with this minifig than all the others I have ever owned.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Sadly, as time went by, I lost this set and all my others during a couple moves in the late 80's. But within the past year, I have since started collecting Lego's again, and my town&nbsp;is bigger than ever. I am trying to get back some of my favorite&nbsp;old sets I enjoyed in my youth, and I recently won an auction for this Exxon set on Ebay, and am anxiously awaiting&nbsp;it to arrive in the mail&nbsp;so I can incorporate it back into my town for both my daughter and I to enjoy.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>On a side note, why does Lego insist these days on making sets that do not include road plates? Not to mention, the footprint of these new sets never&nbsp;mate right&nbsp;up to base plates. Very irritating.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"gelkster","2011-02-11T17:39:14.763Z","awesome gas station","<p>I recall weeks before Christmas (when I got this set) my mom had it stashed in a bag beside her bed. every morning after she went to work (&amp; before I went to school) I'd go in &amp; just look at the box &amp; wish Christmas would hurry up! Finally on Christmas Eve I&nbsp;built it &amp;, unfortunately, my&nbsp;younger cousins were over &amp; one of them ruined&nbsp;a gas pump sticker, so I had to use a piece of masking tape w/ marker on it. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhoo, this set has it all. 2 cars, a cool repair rack, spare tires,&nbsp;nice big picture window, plenty of white clips&nbsp;&amp; tools (a broom!)&nbsp;&amp; the gaspumps were ingenious- I still have 2 built! The stickers have seen better days though. I never knew why there was a blue &amp; red cylinder by the wall behind the building. This set introduced several one-of-a-kind pieces to my growing collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm unsure if newer gas stations sets are any better but overall a great fun classic set no collection should be without.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"mcjaco","2016-03-09T17:17:39.063Z","Getting Gas in Lego Town","<p>As with my past couple of reviews, my boys (age 4) have found my stash of Legos, and we&#39;ve started reconstructing Legoland in the basement (and many of my childhood memories at the same time). &nbsp;I began my collection in 1977, and recently got back into purchasing more now that my kids are interested in them.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I still have the box. No idea why, but it was kept all these years folded nicely in a box. &nbsp;The box nicely displays the set, giving you a good idea what&#39;s included, and alternate building ideas on the back. &nbsp;Not sure I ever strayed from the actual set, as it is just too cool as is.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This was the first set I had with ubiquitous&nbsp;hinge piece, which was very cooly used for having opening hoods on both vehicles. &nbsp;The spare wheels, and one stud cylinders in red and blue are cool too. &nbsp;It also included my first tools in the garage area, and &quot;hoses&quot; for the gas pumps.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Included in the set are three minifigs. &nbsp;My favorite being the man with the ten gallon hat. &nbsp;What says petroleum like a dude in a ten gallon hat?! &nbsp;The other two figures are dressed in Exxon garb. &nbsp;One female, one male. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple build. &nbsp;It&#39;s a small main office, with a large main window. &nbsp;The pump canopy&nbsp;structures, again are easy, and the one attaches to the roof of the main building creating a layer roof, which I always thought was pretty neat. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The pumps were the most difficult part of the build, as I recall (as a five year old), due to the hoses. &nbsp;35 years later, I found all four pumps still fully constructed in one of my sorting tubs! &nbsp;</p>

<p>The highlight of the whole set is the very cool car lift in the open air garage. &nbsp;Two ramps lead to an elevated lift that then can rise even higher with large hinges! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Both cars are the&nbsp;same build, just in different colors, and one sports a fake folded up convertible top.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s eye catching. &nbsp;The large rooftop sign, the &quot;<em>Happy Motoring</em>&quot; signage above the main office, the little tire and oil can racks, and I love the color scheme and striping on main supports for the canopies. &nbsp;Lots of playability with the addition of the garage area. &nbsp;The office is just right. &nbsp;A small stickered piece with &quot;files&quot; for the desk, and a large map of Legoland affixed to the wall. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Again. &nbsp;Eye catching. &nbsp;My main sets throughout my early Legoland additions all seemed to be red and yellow. &nbsp;This one, however, pops out. &nbsp;The red canopies with the white striping, the blue baseboards, and the nice little garage area. &nbsp;The massive signage on the roof is wonderful too. &nbsp;</p>
