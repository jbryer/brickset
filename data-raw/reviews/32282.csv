<p>The latest set from the LEGO Ideas theme is this Motorised Lighthouse which feature a lighthouse on a cliff with rotating lights and illuminated cottage.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661646263061-PYEOBTCE8GNK42T3PN3S/DSC06093.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>The lighthouse is a full enclosed and not a dollhouse type of building. The lighthouse is located on top of a cliff to warn any passing ships for the danger of the cliff. There is a cottage for the guardian of the lighthouse to live in.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/4e6ddf54-85e7-42cb-9185-674e7f5f5be8/DSC06072.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>The light on top of the lighthouse can be illuminated along with the lighting in the cottage. I think the lighting on top of the lighthouse is not bright enough. The lighting inside the cottage is bright enough when we view it inside. But it would be better to illuminate the outdoor of the cabin.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/d22391f0-91a9-4ce0-9d7b-7fcbd1475c61/DSC06069.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>The light that illuminate the interior of the cottage originate from the stove used for cooking. The original light is in white colour. It is placed behind Trans orange parts to give a visual effect of fire shown on the photo above.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/8753f664-c118-4219-8dd4-87e8d3dce02c/DSC06076.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>There are two minifigures on this set. The guardian have a nice detailed torso, and he held telescope which he used to search for someone who is visiting him. The female minifigure who might be the daughter of the guardian is wearing torso that resemble turtle-neck covered with water-resistant jacket and waterproof hat. The daughter is holding compass to guide her to the lighthouse. We can see that the expression of the guardian is kind of sad. It might be due to his loneliness.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/3201519a-086c-4f31-9b00-37c531003c3a/DSC06077.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>The torso at the back are simple without any detailed printing. A litle kitten is accompanying the daughter to stay with her father, so he won&#39;t feel so lonely in living there. Both of the minifigure do not have alternative expressions. The hat worn by the daughter is the firefighter hat in green colour.</p>

<p>The other animal on this set is a seagull with printed wings and beak. The seagull is made from rubbery material, and it is quite rare. It was previously only available from large sets such as 60271, 10261 and 21330.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/fec20246-239e-4af4-8be4-8bacd3965b32/DSC06100.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>At the bottom of the cottage, there is a small dock where the guardian of the lighthouse usually wait for visitor to bring him food supply or other equipment that he can use. On the dock, there is a barrel with fish and on one side of the cliff, there is an old anchor which is a relic from shipwreck.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/59ab12eb-4e04-48af-af5c-d97b1d9e9e05/DSC06079.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>The daughter arrived at the lighthouse in a boat with the name &quot;LEDA&quot;. This boat is equipped with two oars, a small bucket and a chain used to tether the boat to the dock.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661657331260-RNWT6J2SSCA9P40ZT0GA/DSC06105.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>On one side of the cliff, there is a cave with a treasure chest and a bat in it. The lever to activate the lighthouse light and the stove light inside the cottage is also located here. To activate, we just push the lever down.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/0ead32fe-1d49-4d66-80f5-74ca8028027f/DSC06106.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>The treasure chest is filled by various precious stones with four different colours. It might be emeralds, tourmaline, ruby and sapphire.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661659214762-WSYSJPIAXV2S21ACPYF1/DSC06108.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>One the other side of the cliff, there is a rock covering the battery pack. Actually the battery pack also has similar colour with the cliff, but the shape is too obvious, hence, the rock covering is required. Above the cliff, we can also see covering for the LED light used for the cottage interior. The covering for the light is located on the bottom section of the chimney.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/c3c52f47-8f6e-4907-8e46-554d9e560837/DSC06102.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>The cottage for the lighthouse guardian is simple. The cottage is named as &quot;Aurora Point&quot; which might be the name for the location of the lighthouse. Near the front door of the cottage, there is a lantern hanged for illumination at night. On the rooftop, there is a smoke coming out from the stove inside the cottage. In front of the door, there is a railing going down from the cottage to the dock.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/d75113d5-efe4-411f-8a06-3ce678c3b0a7/DSC06110.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>When the door is opened, we can see a hallway connecting the cottage into the lighthouse. Near the end of the hallway (which is located inside the lighthouse), there is a ladder used to climb up to the upper section of the lighthouse.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661661823155-1BXJDY13PPKLX6KEKEA3/DSC06113.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above which the sectional walls on the lighthouse have been removed, we can see series of ladder to climb from the ground floor of the lighthouse up to the top most section of the lighthouse. There are 4 ladders as can be shown on the photo.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661662655122-EAZ4KPSWCMHT3B9JXDW5/DSC06121.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>From this view, we can see there is a picture of the lighthouse hanged on the wall above the bed, there is a table with candle and its holder, a hanged fish decoration, a piece of cheese and a bottle of drink. The hallway connecting the cottage to the lighthouse is located below the fish decoration.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661662655415-QSOHQNCRS7XAUSKVSTF1/DSC06120.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see more of the cottage&#39;s interior. There is the stove with tea pot on top of it. Above the teapot we can see pan and fork hanged. There are also piles of wood used for the stove. There is a clock hanged on the wall and below the clock we can see a desk with a map, quill pen and ink and a teacup placed on top of the desk.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661680124572-BCY3LIF7Z2DKD5CF4V1P/DSC06122.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>From this point of view, we can see more clearly the picture of the lighthouse. There are four minifigures in the portrait. I can only guess that might be the family photo of the lighthouse guardian. He hanged it there as a reminder of his family.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1661680124957-RUQYQNL3WCMQ75TBCM5K/DSC06115.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>There is a portrait of someone on the lighthouse. It could be a portrait of a noble who built this lighthouse. Or it can be also the portrait previous guardian of the lighthouse. This portrait along with the lighthouse photo and map are not printed tiles but from stickers.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/90b5767e-7895-494d-93b4-d9d25a5da744/DSC06129.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>One thing that I like from this set is the structural strength of the lighthouse. I tried to hold on the lighthouse body then lifted it up and the structure still held. I tried to shake it and it still held. Though bear in mind if you try to shake it too hard, some parts might become loose. Nevertheless, it is advised to carry the lighthouse set with another hand supporting the baseplate from below.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Assembling this set is fun and does not take too long. It is also not monotonous.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I was a bit surprised that this set contains fewer parts than what I expected, but it still provides satisfying result.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Children can play with it. My 3 old son like to turn on the rotating lights and looking at in. For adult, this lighthouse can be used as a display and can be incorporated into city diorama as well.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well I get this set for free. But at first, I think this set is more costly than usual when compared to previous IDEAS sets. But I realised what make this set a bit high is the motor, light and battery pack. So always remember, you&#39;re also paying for the battery pack, motor and LED light.</p>

"mablemyhre","2023-01-03T02:35:58.407Z","Great lighthouse","<p>Lego out did itself on this. A great build with a light which lights and with a motor that spins the light. I would highly recommend this. I am 68 years old and I was delighted to get it for Christmas. The only bad thing is that the instructions are not that clear. And the fireplace lights.</p>
