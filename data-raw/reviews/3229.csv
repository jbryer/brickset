"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T13:04:47Z","One of my favorites","I got this for my birthday when it first came out. Some of the unique pieces include the engines, the wings, the tail, and the functional (box-flinging) forklift. The little packages actually open and snap shut. The top opens to reveal slick rails to place the packages on. The decals are also neat. If you lower the wings and move two of the engines back to the tail and remove the other two engines, you can make it into a Boeing MD-80. Overall, fun, fun set, especially for the more boring (IMO) town theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-07T07:50:54Z","very nice plane","i like this one especially because there are different ways to open the plain body to load and unload it. the colour scheme is cool, the wings are a little short compared to the overall length of the plane.
the forklift looks really cute compared to newer models (like in 4512) which are nearly 200% as big!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jimcha","2005-11-10T15:14:25Z","great airplane","This is definitely one of my favorite airplanes.  A sleek jet with nice colors, I like the high wing design with the engines paired underneath.  It comes with a captain and a worker, as well as two vehicles and 3 crates.  It has room for much more cargo, though, so get more crates or build your own goods!  In addition to the standard flip-up roof, the tail section immediately rear of the wings hinges to one side allowing easy access...
IMO, this is one of the last really good town sets.  I got mine for $5.50 on ebay!!!

Although the wings seem a little bit out of proportion, this set is nice none the less. The nose of the aircraft is very elegant. It comes with four engines, two per wing. Maybe this is a bit to much horse power for a not so large aircraft. But hey, the more parts the better! It would transport the three cargo crates rapidly to its destination though. It comes with two minifigs, three blank yellow crates and no less than two support carts. The lifting cart has a unique lift piece, to load the aircraft. The tail can be opened, as well as the front top section.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2019-11-08T19:01:13.23Z","Flying Cargo is Fun","<p>This cargo plane was the first large flying vessel in my Lego collection. I remember building it for the first time and for years I would build it again and play hundreds of times with my friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Plane itself</strong><br />
The set includes a big plane &ndash; one of the largest of its time. It has no doors, but the side can be opened to add cargo there, as well the tail section can be opened to move additional boxes in there as well.</p>

<p>The main color is red, but the inside includes blue plates for easier movement of the containers (3 in total). There is one place for a classic Pilot minifigure.</p>

<p>Wings are large and have 4 turbines. Unlike other planes, these are high above ground, attached to the &quot;roof&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
The set includes two figures, mentioned above. Classic Pilot in black suit and a Ground Crew member in blue cap and with&nbsp;a classic Airport sign on his shirt.</p>

<p><strong>Cars</strong><br />
There are also two small cars, one for driving cargo to the plane, the second one allows to (un)load the boxes into or from the plane.</p>

<p><strong>Other opportunities</strong><br />
The set isn&#39;t big, but presents plenty of opportunities to create other things, for instance the backside of the box offers an idea to build a space shuttle. The plane can be easily used for transporting passengers instead of cargo and is a nice addition to your airport (personally my set lived up to join the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6597-1/Century-Skyway"">6597</a>&nbsp;Airport, which I got for birthday in 1990s).</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yO2Y-NMIofidsFWqRbOgCrFMImxXezKOxaduZ_KwcE42D-xguuycp9a3-zGPRcYFaUFByFYXb5aj83hLHFdODT5TLaTMbBnYLCmYCSRxdsXS_7FOhVaTU5VHc7ZnudD25kXHnXR1kjA=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Today, when LEGO make&nbsp;a plane, they give you ton of big, ugly and useless pieces. You know, one part for wings, one for canopy etc. But thirty years ago that was not the case. LEGO was mainly about rebuilding existing models, so the more standard parts there was in the set, the better.</p>

<p>This plane looks beautiful, even though after thirty years those pieces are not in the same condition anymore. The model is quite big, measures round 30&nbsp;cm long. It is done in great white and red colors, with some prints on sides and rudder. Shape of the plane is copied with great precision.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fAYF1W2TpLhbNIOOz98TdIW44_ATf4vHbji0J2pssbKns2y2DtOxyVbmpOqPPp4KRf4-20x35joJV0Y40CIBDN_DW1Bo4C3VbmSEIRjFxCLqTpC7NgTE3OKioZ4NVzx-iOKfd8JjK5U=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>The wings are mounted on top of the plane. They had some position lights (red and green). Underneath, there are two pairs of jet engines, which still looks and works pretty well. On the top of the vertical rudder there is also a horizontal one, also with a position light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the plane there is a lot of free space. This is a cargo craft, so it has to have enough space to transport something. In this set the cargo are three yellow boxes. They fit inside pretty well, leaving space to put there something more (for example a minifig or two). There are two ways of accessing the inside of the hull. First, you can open the main door at the side. It is attached on old type of hinges, and works very smooth. The second way is more important when you&#39;re unloading the craft. To do that, you have to detach 2x2 tile from the top, and then the whole tail section will swing giving you access to the interior. It also allows you to put even more cargo. The tail also has an opening roof, working the same way as the main door.</p>

<p>There is also one more thing inside, and that is a canopy. It is very simple, just a black console and a place to put a pilot. There is enough space to give your fig some steering mechanism though. The canopy is in my opinion the main flaw of this model. Windshield is attached on six studs, and you need some strength to take it off. The pilot also tend to stuck inside. There is not enough space to put your fingers inside, so to take him out, you best open the main door. That helps a lot.</p>

<p>The plane can land on five sets of wheels. The front one can turn around, which is great when you want to play with this set. The rear&nbsp;have nicely designed gondola in red and gray. It works good enough.</p>

<p>There are also two side builds in this set. First of them is a forklift. It uses an old piece to make it works. You can easily use it to load your plane. There is a seat for one fig. The operator has&nbsp;a set of levers to control the car. At the back there is a really nice looking ladder, that mimics the radiator. As a final touch, the front wheels are bigger, which give this small vehicle a nice, industrial look.</p>

<p>The last part is a small car to transport boxes. There is nothing too fancy about it. There is a place for a fig to seat, a steering wheel to drive around and a trunk that fits one box. At the front there is a pair of yellow lights, and some mudguards to add a final detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, we got only two, to man three vehicles. But it is okay. Set is old, nowadays, there would be probably two more figs.</p>

<p>Pilot is dressed in black suit and black trousers. Underneath the suit there is a white shirt and black tie. There also should be a golden insignia on the suit, but as I said before, this set has thirty years and is a bit damaged. The face is a standard one. He also wears a black police officer hat.</p>

<p>The second fig is an airport crew member. He has blue legs and a white shirt with a nice place silhouette on it. There is also a couple of colorful stripes at the bottom. Face is standard, hat also, typical blue one.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Set is not very big in terms of parts. There is around 200. There are mostly very typical ones, like tiles, plates or bricks. To the interesting ones you can count panels in red (six of them, two with a print) and panel widows. Printed console looks simple, but great. There is also big amount of 4x4 and 4x2 inverted roof parts. Opening roofs are also great.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>After all those years this is still a great looking set. It hasn&#39;t lost any bit of its playability. I wish LEGO would someday come back to their roots and made a great set like this once again.</p>
