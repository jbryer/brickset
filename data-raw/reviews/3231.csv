The sliding warehouse door and forklift were among the best features.  I would give a 10/10 to the larger cargo center, which was an amazing set, and had I had the money, I would have gotten that instead.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rick76","2005-06-08T14:42:36Z","A truly good set","I bought this set in december of 1988, I was looking for the 1985 airport but was no longer available.  Since it had a cargo jet I figure out it was going to be ok. And indeed it was. Surely it was money well invested because i remember spendind around Thirty US$ I also bought Turbo Prop I along with this set, and 2 cars for my town.   Had a lot of fun with the delivery center...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"fulcrand","2005-08-19T09:35:58Z","So jalous!","How can Lego release such a beautiful set in the US only?
I would fire the marketing director right away!!!
It is never too late to re-launch in Europe. Hope someone from Lego reeds this... In the meantime, I manage to built it with my own parts. I got 95% close.

"chris38911","2021-08-14T16:42:14.863Z","So many rare parts!","<p>I first came across this set on Brickset, and was surprised to find out that this was a North America-only set. Shame, because it&#39;s a set with super-playability, and is something completely different to the usual Town building sets&nbsp;- houses, police stations, fire stations, petrol stations, car repair garages etc etc.</p>

<p>So, I thought I&#39;d try to rebuild it via online building instructions and Bricklink/Brickowl. Be warned, if you want to buy all the parts, (or buy it complete) it&#39;s going to take a lot of &pound;s, $s,&nbsp;&euro;s, galleons, cubits, Pok&eacute; dollars or whatever currency you use&nbsp;-&nbsp;because it has a surprising number of&nbsp;rare parts that are generally only available for sale in North America. If you can find them at all.&nbsp;I eventually managed to do it, with some luck and the help of an old friend living in&nbsp;Wyoming, USA.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>As you&#39;d expect from a mid-80&#39;s set, it&#39;s a straightforward build, nothing special or difficult, and well put together. The initial build of the warehouse is a little fiddly, as it&#39;s based on black 2x2 space stands rather than a baseplate, but nothing major - once the red warehouse starts to&nbsp;be built, it&#39;s perfectly stable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fair to say that the designer mostly pinched the design from other sets, and then modified it slightly. The little white van is a re-colour of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6624-1/Delivery-Van"">6624&nbsp;Delivery Van</a>, the forklift truck is a roofed version of the one in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6391-1/Cargo-Center"">6391 Cargo&nbsp;Centre</a>, the cargo plane is recognisably a standard (for the time) 4-wide plane with hinged roof -&nbsp;with the windows replaced by panels, the little red warehouse is very similar to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6364-1/Paramedic-Unit"">6364 Paramedic Unit</a>.</p>

<p>But, it all comes together very well, although there are a few stickers across multiple bricks, and other stickers, to deal with.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Four minifigs - 3 generic workers and a generic pilot - all using common printed torsos and the ubiquitous standard grin pattern yellow head. The vast majority of the parts in this set are bog-standard bricks and plates, with a few of the more specialist (but still common) bricks and plates that started to come in to Lego in the early 80&#39;s - the ones that give this era&#39;s sets their charm. You wouldn&#39;t think it - but, some of the parts are unique to this set, are now expensive and are quite rare and&nbsp;difficult to obtain outside&nbsp;North America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unique to the set, very few Bricklink or Brickowl sellers, expensive:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The blue printed tail on the plane&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The blue engine pieces on the plane&nbsp; (no sellers @ Aug 21)</li>
	<li>The red 2x2 45 slope piece with printed computer screen and buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>Relatively uncommon/expensive parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the forklift assembly with spring (the springs are easy to lose)</li>
	<li>white door with vertical panes</li>
	<li>white sliding door</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you want to build this set today, you need some dosh!</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Fab! What&#39;s not to like?&nbsp;Four minifigs, 2 vehicles, a plane and a small warehouse with a sliding door.&nbsp;There&#39;s plenty of pretend cargo to handle, in the form of 2x2 yellow bricks, some on pallets for the forklift, and lots of fun to be had moving stuff round and in/out of vehicles. An ideal add-on to any town or for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6392-1/Airport"">6392 Airport</a> or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6396-1/International-Jetport"">6396 International Jetport</a>, or an add-on for any cargo train set. Very easy to expand into a bigger warehouse using standard bricks and plates.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>This set has so much playability and potential, it has to be 5 stars. Based on the original price of the set!</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I would have loved to have this set when I was a kid - but had no chance of getting it, being outside North America. I think it&#39;s a fantastic set with fantastic playability&nbsp;- that probably didn&#39;t take very much designing by Lego. It&#39;s a real shame it was only available in North America at the time - was that a conscious decision by Lego, or was Lego North America designing sets just for that market?&nbsp;</p>
