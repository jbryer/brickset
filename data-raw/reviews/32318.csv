<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The one minifigure included here is <strong>Alex</strong>. Alex first appeared in 2015 and since then either her or Steve have appeared in almost every set. But it is nice to get her in a cheap set.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Turtle</strong>&nbsp;first appeared in 2019 in 21152 Pirate Ship. The build is very well-designed and captures the in-game accuracy well. The printing for the head is also nice.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The main build is relatively small, but still charming. We&#39;ve got some turtle eggs that feature some nice printing, and a nice archway with a suggestion of carpeting on top. The small rose to the side is also nice.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this is a good polybag that has a decent amount to offer in a small set at a low price-point.&nbsp;<strong>8/10</strong></p>
