"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-21T13:47:07Z","Great tank station","I like this building so much, I was very happy when I get it. It has a shop and a garage and I find it very cosy. the figs are also nice
Shell was on the moment of making this set a company that supports the dictatorial regime of South-Africa and thats made the Octan version maybe a better set, but it is a very nice design.
The only problem : it has stickers. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"m1rec","2006-02-21T02:53:11Z","Nice Shell gas station","This is great set if you are making collection of City sets. Also it looks very nice to have it put on the shelf only. 

Small minus is that there is only one combination in the manual, but this is leveraged with last page of manual where you can find some modification hints.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-10-22T13:28:48.03Z","Fill'er Up!","One of the classic 80's Legoland Town sets I owned as a child and rebuilt upon emerging from my Dark Age. I was able to complete the set using bricklink but was glad to have the majority of the parts after not seeing the set for 20 years. 
Great minifig with Shell Logo and many Shell labeled pieces and signs. The snack shop has stickered doors/windows as well. Great tow truck included with mechanic minifig. Gas pumps complete with rope style hoses add realism to set. Great baseplate to build on as well. 
On the down side, there are no price signs for the gas. This would have been an added touch of realism that later gas station sets from LEGO would have. The Shop and Mechanic Garage are quite thin (6 studs deep or so) that leave one wanting more. This can be rectified by expanding the set yourself. I can understand why this was designed this way (so that cars can fit on both sides of the pumps in front of the gas station) but the lack of details within the shop and garage leave you wanting more.
Overall, this is an awesome set! I know I am biased towards these sets but they were what got me hooked on LEGO in the first place 20 years ago.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BM_Construction","2009-01-03T02:44:30.56Z","Personal Fave","This is a solid all-around set.

It was also my first Lego set that wasn't Basic or Duplo when it was under the tree Christmas 1988. My older brother helped me build it and eventually I lost the instructions. Thankfully, my brother had made a video of it that Christmas with Guns 'N' Roses' Welcome To The Jungle playing in the background (haha) and I was able to rebuild it almost brick for brick. Then I was very glad to find the instructions scanned and posted online and I wasn't too far off!

Now if I could only find the lost hammer and other small lost pieces.

We didn't have Shell stations in our area at the time so when I first seen one in real life I remember thinking, ""We must be in Legoland!"".",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-04T12:38:21.34Z","Shell Service Station Review","<p>This was one of my early Town sets that I got, not the first, but up there. Just having a gas station for a Town/City theme adds dimensions to any collection. That this set features a Real World logo... as a child, I thought it added realism. It's still pretty good today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's plenty of little features with this set to stay busy, 2 minifigures, a mechanic and Gas Station Attendant. A tow truck for hauling cars to Shell's Garage to be worked on, car jack. Tires for sale, air pump, ""island"" with 4 stations for cars to fuel up at, mail box. Registers inside where lego people can pay at. The only thing I'd have done different is to have added som stuff inside the Shop area for lego people to buy. Otherwise it's very empty. There are of course a lot of stickers, but with this set's build, you do need them in many places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has been a good little set and served my Lego Community for many years.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"dukeofstradone","2010-08-19T17:22:34.077Z","My First Lego Set","What a brill set, and also my first. Brings back so many memories. <br><br>Looking back it looks very basic but it was great, and the photo does the set real justice. I wish i was young again so i could play with lego again. I think the only piece i lost was the brown brush. The tow truck was cool.<br><br>Quality set-10 out of 10!!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"BWhyte","2011-03-17T11:12:22.047Z","Great Gas Station Set","I just picked this up on Ebay and I must tell you that I am impressed.&nbsp; I have the 6375 Exxon station as well and this one is right up there with that one.&nbsp; The positives are the new fuel pump design and all of the signage.&nbsp; The negatives are the lack of a car or motorcycle and the truck.&nbsp; I don't understand the color scheme on the truck at all - the blue tow device with the red top just looks odd - why not all white with a red tow device?&nbsp; <br>I must say that with the baseplate it will be a great addition to my town layout and I think LEGO did a good job with this set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Count_Tofu","2013-07-04T19:28:43.727Z","So much detail!","This was one of the last LEGO Town sets I bought when I was 13, with my own money. It was the same price as the 6379 Horse Riding Stable - and I almost couldn't choose... but I did! The price back then was like 59,95 Dutch guilders, something like 25 euro.<div><br></div><div>I really liked the many little details in this set. The unique baseplate, the awesome pumps, the many stickers, the car vacuum cleaner, the brush, ... And the set being in the three tone Shell colors, which I think looked really good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One let down to me was the very normal car that was included. The LEGO cars back then were cool, but very much alike. I had a number of cars (6629, 6655, 6369) and this one didn't add much new regarding design or parts.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"bricksofcanada","2021-02-22T14:47:44.57Z","Best gas station of them all.","<p>Some of the older gas stations (and newer) never seemed to interest me as much as this one. The&nbsp;shop, the&nbsp;air hose for flat tires, and the brush for cleaning your windshield&nbsp;just makes&nbsp;the set even more realistic than it already is and, give extra play features.&nbsp;This&nbsp;set is a fun&nbsp;toy and a great display item! You can&rsquo;t get any better than that. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Some interesting features&nbsp;include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;Four pumps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Tow truck</p>

<p>&nbsp; Brush for cleaning windshields</p>

<p>&nbsp;Extra tires</p>

<p>&nbsp;Box probably used for storing road salt</p>
