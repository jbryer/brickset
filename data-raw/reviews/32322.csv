<p>I believe it is a fairly basic set built, although it is a polybag so it&#39;s not designed to be intricate,using fairly basic pieces it accomplishes a decent build though I do wish that it would have covered the internal dark tan and dark bluish grey pieces with a few more highlighter yellow bricks but overall not bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play Value it has decent play value once completed but on it&#39;s own it&#39;s fairly weak but with the other city fire sets from this year it goes along well, and I believe it would benefit from maybe a small build that&#39;s on fire and a fire extinguisher for the other clip on the back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value For Money</p>

<p>I believe for a 5$&nbsp; US it&#39;s not bad and comparable to past city fire polybags.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe it is a solid polybag and is a set I believe that you should pick up if you like lego city fire.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <strong>Minifigure </strong>the<strong> </strong>firefighter<strong>&nbsp;</strong>lady<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in this set is nice. She has a double-sided head one side with a smile and the other with a smile and dirt. Her helmet is neon yellow dual moulded with black. Her torso is printed with gauges and hazard strips and brown straps. Her legs are printed with yellow stripes.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <strong>The build&nbsp;</strong>this set is interesting because of the neon yellow pieces. The truck is equipped with headlights a couple of blue lights. And an axe for the firefighter.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <strong>Overall</strong>&nbsp;an excellent set a bit different from most of the firefighter polybags. An excellent price like most polybags. I definitely recommend this set.</p>
