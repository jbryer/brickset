"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-23T12:35:55Z","Great stable","A very nice greater set with 2 figs and 2 horses. The things to jump over are good, the building itself is well done. It has on the inside a stable for the horses, an attic to storage straw and a place to put saddles and broomsticks etc.
I'm thinking to add a living room and bedrooms for the figs to make it a farm.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-10-09T02:23:58.653Z","A real classic","This is a set which deserves a re-release.  As a riding school it has everything - training ground with fences and the like to jump over, stables, a grooming area, horses and riders.  There is also a wealth of pieces for making buildings of all kinds.

It combines play value with nice aesthetics -- not only can you admire the proportions of the barn and the various fences and jumps, but you can have both the people and the horses go through a nice variety of activities, from show jumping to ordinary horse care  chores like hauling hay to the barn, feeding and watering the horses, and so on.  There are some nice touches too when it comes to pieces.  It's not often that you run across the classic 2x2 windows in any color but red -- here you have both blue 2x2 windows as well as the short blue shutters.  And pieces used for jumps which are likewise in unusual colors -- red space guns, yellow fence pieces, and so on.  This is a set that's definitely worth looking for.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-16T11:59:03.297Z","Horse Ranch Review","<p>I remember this set well, the first ""large"" set I got from my parents when they realized how much into Lego I was becoming. I think the last time I put this set together was about 15 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a very charming and entertaining set, featuring plenty of little activities such as the Horse training, feeding, and showmanship. Little features such as flowers, tree, wagon for hauling hay, feed troughs for the horses. 2 minifigs and plenty of little accessories make for hours of fun with not just the main set but other ideas too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Riding Stable is&nbsp;set on one of the ever most needed and wanted base plates, so even when you decide to build something else, you have a base plate to work with. I was hoping for Space that year with my birthday, but&nbsp;my parents&nbsp;got me this, thinking I was still attached to My Little Pony. That's alright ultimately, this is a great little set with doors and windows that can be used for building a house or other building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And having reassembled this set recently, I'm reminded of all the fun I've had with this set as a child while playing with my daughter and the fun she's having engaging in the different activities and discovering this set for herself.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
