"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-11T05:46:23Z","The best Lego hospital","This set isn't one of my favourites, but it's pretty good.  This is my first choice for a hospital for a lego town, and it's worth buying multiples of to build a bigger hospital too.  

The ambulance has a nice design, the figures are good, and the bricks are versatile enough to make other nice buildings.  If only they still made sets like these! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T00:05:58Z","A surprisingly fun set!","This set is just great. Plenty of room and lots of opportunities for modifications and additions. Comes with an operating theatre, reception area, upper office, ambulance, and 5 minifigs! Nice details, especially the operating light!

A must for any LEGO town!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-27T18:45:01Z","Hospital!","Got mine about 90% complete for free :)
Anyways, a nice set that includes many wonderful elements such as the 10 (!) 1x4x5 windows, the ambulance is great, as well as the minifigs, the seating area outside is a nice touch, and it's the ONLY minifig hospital (besides the Dacta one). The only problem is that it's not available anymore, which is just sad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-06T13:22:18Z","Very good hospital","This is a great addition to every city of lego. it has 2 docters, a driver with an ambulance and 2 patients. Also ,Much windows. and a nice baseplate you can use for other mocs.The building exists of a entrance with check-in, a patient room and an operation room.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-02T03:25:44Z","one of the best ever town sets of all time","This is a classic set. it has an exellant design, is simply put together, and the style is one of the best. A 10 to be sure. I do not own this, but my sister did, and anyone that has looked at this set will acknowlage that it is a 10

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-30T10:34:39Z","Hospital","The only decent hospital to date, makes this one a must have....i just love those Red Cross Medics, they are so cool, looks kinda like the hospital from Lego Island(1996) but this is the first one made of the two(remember this is not the first hospital made by Lego Nice amount of minifigs but i must ask, why does the directions call for those chairs to be on the lawn????? I still think this is a good set besides its tackyness and SHOULD be RE-RELEASED by LEGO!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-06T20:52:46Z","YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","this is a great set. bought mine off brickink mifsb (mint in factory sealed box)in dec. '04. mine came with a 1990 us catolog, so i assume it was manufactured in 1990. great set! best hospital from lego.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rafalko","2009-12-17T08:27:42.967Z","Very nice building!","My favourite hospital is 363. After decade lego produced the second hospital - 6380. But saying the truth it is not a hospital. Who saw a hospital with only 1 doctor? Of course there's a nice operation room, but why there's only 1 bed for patients? If only they gave 2 or 4 beds...

The set 363 has no inside, but thank to this, playing with the older set, I could imagine how big it was inside, how many doctors there were working inside, how many beds there were.

I like very much the set 6380 - It is much more beautiful, than nowadays lego buildings. I only wanted to point, that now lego wants to contain everything in every set. They developed cars with 6, 8 entities wide and more. But hey forgot, that a good set should have some place for the imagination of young person, who wants to play with it.

And lego city shouldn't contain only fire station and police buildings.

Still I'm giving 5 to the set! It is beautiful and matches very good to other buildings from the golden eighties era!

"StormSworder","2009-04-08T02:31:31.903Z","A great set.","There seem to have been very few hospitals or medical-related sets over the years, and the recent one isn't worth a dime.  Lucky then that this set is a gorgeous, inspired design.  Along with the ambulance and stretcher, great attention to detail is paid to the building with its reception, treatment room and waiting area.  A real classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Naylus","2009-07-06T12:46:15.843Z","A very nice hospital","I bought this set only a few days ago. When I was little I wanted it very much, one of the reasons was that this set was shown in a very cool way in a Lego catalog of those times, where one could see this hospital and the street full of Lego people watching the night sky as the rescue helicopter was passing by.

This set includes a wonderful car, several doctors and 2 patients. It also has several good details, like chairs, cups and medical accessories, not to mention interesting windows and flowers.

I actually received this set with an additional female doctor, with black hair, that wasn't originally in 6380.

Oh, did I say, that there is a girl with a rare pigtails hair?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keexko","2009-04-18T07:10:00.06Z","Great Buy","I got this set off of eBay awhile back. My girl really wanted this and when we bought it, it did not disappoint.

The set was kept in great condition. It had 5 minifigs and there was so much detail in the building as well as the accessories in spite of it being a vintage set. Apart from that the ambulance is great too b/c it speeds off really fast!

All in all I'll give it a 5/5. This set definitely deserves it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J_tje","2010-02-06T03:50:21.42Z","Finally a Real Treatment Centre for Lego Town","The biggest release in the town Medical series this set is a must have for your Lego town. It comes with an Ambulance and 5 minifig. It has stretchers, desk with phone, computer, cool water cooler, greenery and lots of glasses... (do they hang around and drink coffee allday?)

I especially like the carport for the ambulance, and the hight of the model. All in all a must have for any self respecting Lego Town.

"AETerry","2011-02-04T13:05:10.617Z","Emergency Treatment Center Review","<p>I remember getting this for a birthday from my Aunt, same birthday that I got the Pirates' Forbidden Island set. It was unexpected to get two ""large"" sets like that for a birthday. Usually something like that happened when Christmas came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And wow, like Lego Banks, Lego Hospitals are fairly rare and hard to come by. There's an older set in the archives and a more newer recent one from about 2007. Looking between them both, I am happy to have this one in my collection. Most other stuff for the Medical theme have been just an ambulance or Doctor with patient deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The base plate is wonderful, far different then any others I've seen, aside from being the base for MOC houses, it's seen a lot of use as the Hospital set it's meant for. And now that I'm older, I find building this set comes fast and quickly, though still enjoyable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 Minifigures fill this set out, 2 Doctors, Ambulance Driver and 2 patients. There's plenty of little details inside and out from hospital room, stretchers, water cooler, main desk, chairs, foliage, trash can. It's just a wonderful set and great addition to a Lego City or Town. My&nbsp; Doctor from&nbsp;the Town Minifigure set naturally found a home here.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"T79","2014-08-27T10:57:17.973Z","Definitely the nicest lego hospital around","<p>When checking brickset to see which other old sets we had I&nbsp;stumbled&nbsp;on this one,&nbsp;my eldest son happened to see it and immediately exclaimed: &quot;I want this!&quot; So what better excuse to get this&nbsp;set sorted out and built up again?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is no longer in my possession but at least the instructions are: an A4 sized booklet with eight pages, the top half of the front page shows the same image as the box, the lower half of the last page shows the set from the rear. In total there are 16 steps for the building and 11 for the ambulance or 27 in total, this means more then ten pieces per step! There are a few sub builds but still a rather large mean amount. Again, no wasted space, ads or parts list&nbsp;here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of nice parts, while most may not be that&nbsp;special they were rare to unique&nbsp;in our collection. First the baseplate, this is&nbsp;a rather unique 32 x 32 green plate with a grey asphalt driveway and looks fantastic in its simplicity. Then, there are windows galore: ten tall red windows, two red roof windows and four clear panels with red bar and white grille (not exactly windows but still transparent panels), these are used in the ambulance. Too bad the details on those windows&nbsp;are all stickered except for the four panels but they are still holding out even after all these years. Lots of white bricks and plates and some nice miscellaneous parts: our only black minifig seat,&nbsp;one telephone and&nbsp;one computer slope brick, three tiles with a printed red cross, two stretchers, three clear cups, a yellow 2 x 2 x 2 container etc. Even a trash can (#6693 Refuse Collection Truck came out in the same year)! I did miss a door or two, though.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains five minifigures: an ambulance driver, a nurse, a doctor and two patients. An extra nurse (so the office could be manned and the doctor assisted at the same time) would have been nice, and maybe a female doctor to replace the male one? We also had #6365 Med-Star Rescue Plane and that set again had a male doctor. Luckily they are all still minifigs with the standard smile so just change the hair and your doctor is now female!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It actually does not last very long, what with the big windows and all, but it&#39;s nice to build anyway. Overall the set could have been made a bit bigger though: the carport is too short and the entire rear left corner of the baseplate remains unused. There are some nice details like the water cooler and the scanner, and the overall shape of the building is just beautiful. I always missed some doors on this set though, where do visitors enter? Also via the emergency entrance through the carport? And having just some stretchers for the patients seemed wrong, why aren&#39;t there any real beds? There&#39;s still plenty of room to build a ward, in fact that and a door&nbsp;were usually the first things we added. Not having extra red windows was a hindrance though, but adding some height to the scanner room made a second floor with a bed possible without needing more windows.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Another favourite of my children now, the lower floor is permanently stuffed with victims from the latest disaster. And they love the trash can that was included, although once I received&nbsp;#6668 Recycle Truck&nbsp;that container&nbsp;seemed to be more appropriate than just that small bin. The ambulance is nice to zoom around, just be careful the antenna is not too high up when entering the carport or it will snag (the carport is only <em>just</em> high enough, something which also happens in other sets like #6386 Police Command Base and #6389 Fire Control Center too). It looks very nice in our lego city next to the fire station, police station and service station. The green baseplate and small pine tree add a much needed air of tranquility in comparison with the others I mentioned on their grey baseplate, just imagine they have green floors inside.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A rather unique set, this was the only hospital we had (or even were aware of). Thanks to the internet I now know there were others (if not too many)&nbsp;but as far as I can see, if I could choose between #7892 Hospital and this one I&#39;d definitely&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> go with #7892 (what on earth <em>is</em> that thing, anyway)&nbsp;so if you want a nice&nbsp;hospital set, get this one!</p>

"HomeOnTheRange","2022-11-30T01:22:44.37Z","Still ready to treat patients 35 years later!","<p>I recently pulled this set out&nbsp;to play with my own children after 35 years.&nbsp; I remember really liking this set when I received it as a child.&nbsp; The pieces are surprisingly robust, and it was easy to put together even though no one had played with it in 30 years.&nbsp; Some of the white bricks have yellowed a bit more than others.&nbsp; However, surprisingly, even the stickers on the windows are still perfectly intact.&nbsp; This set is very fun both to look at and to play with. The building has two floors with two rooms on the ground floor and one room on the upper floor.&nbsp; It has many cool details.&nbsp; There are two stretchers which have legs with (non-rolling) wheels that fold up so it can go in the back of the ambulance and then fold down when the stretcher is pulled out and rolled into the treatment bay.&nbsp; The treatment bay has a cool arm that swings out with a green lamp to illuminate the patient.&nbsp; There is a computer and an oxygen tank (although this is the same double tank as for the space or scuba sets and thus doesn&#39;t look too much like the typical single tanks in health care settings, yes I became a doctor years after first playing with this set).&nbsp; The really dated part of the set is the style of telephone, although hospitals still have landlines.&nbsp; I also switched the hair before I gave it to my kid so that the woman with brown hair is the doctor. I like the road baseplate as the ambulance is well balanced and rolls very nicely on the drive. It&#39;s also big enough that the hospital could be expanded with additional pieces from other sets.&nbsp;The ambulance top opens up to get the driver in and out and the back opens up to get the patient in and out.&nbsp; There is also a cool little yellow mailbox that I like to think is a box for submitting lab send outs. The patients and family waiting room appears to be in the front lawn, but given the nice spring weather, that likely suits.&nbsp; We used some pieces from another set to put a bed and dresser in the upstairs room at the hospital so it is possible to be an inpatient.&nbsp; When I looked in the set today I saw that the princess from our 1990 castle set was an inpatient at the treatment centre and one of the knights was on the stretcher in the treatment bay being examined by the doctor and nurse.&nbsp;</p>
