"PerryThePlatypus","2022-03-07T14:16:09.423Z","Not really much of a bridge battle, but a really awesome polybag nonetheless ","<p>The 4+&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76184-1/Spider-Man-vs-Mysterio-s-Drone-Attack"">Spider-Man vs Mysterio&rsquo;s Drone Attack</a>&nbsp;set gave us the long awaited black and red spidey suit. The set itself though&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t horrible&hellip; but let&rsquo;s just say it&rsquo;s one of those sets you get just for the figures. Thankfully though, this polybag exists to have a non 4+ and even cheaper way to obtain the figure.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><b>The Drone: </b>At this point, we know that Lego is obsessed with drones, and they keep cranking them out. However, a drone build here is appropriate and the build itself is superb! The design is similar to the drones that appear in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76174-1/Spider-Man-s-Monster-Truck-vs-Mysterio"">Spider-Man&#39;s Monster Truck vs. Mysterio</a>, with just a few differences. The green light in the middle and the guns attached to the drone are nice, and the new stud shooters for 2022 (which fires extremely well) are integrated seamlessly to the build. 2 stickers are used on the model, and they help to give it great detail. Overall, the design for Mysterio&rsquo;s drone has definitely been perfected, it&rsquo;s just a really solid build all around.</p>

<h3>The Minifig</h3>

<p><b>Spider-Man:</b> It took 2 years for this suit to make it&rsquo;s first minifigure debut, and wow, this figure&nbsp;is amazing, I&rsquo;d say it was worth the wait. The prints and just the suit in general looks stellar, black works very well for Spider-Man. The legs are dual-molded, and the shiny silver lines on the torso and legs looks really cool as well. The head uses the relatively new print introduced with the Zombie Hunter variant from the CMF. Finally, his accessories include 2 white power blasts and the Tower Bridge sign that he used as a shield, using a sticker, the presence of the&nbsp;sign was very unexpected, but a very cool inclusion. Overall, this figure came out fantastic, any avid collector of Spider-Man definitely needs this in their collection.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>R65 for this feels very right. The detailed Spider-Man figure plus the drone feels substantial for the price. Polybags in general have great value for money, and it&rsquo;s no different here.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Overall, I love that this serves as a cheaper alternative to obtain the Far From Home suit, but beyond that, this is still an all around excellent polybag that has all you could ask for: a great build, a well-detailed figure and good&nbsp;value. The only nitpick I have is maybe there should&rsquo;ve been some clear pieces included to have the drone hovering, but it&rsquo;s not too big a deal. So if you didn&rsquo;t get the 4+ set but still want the Spider-Man figure, this polybag is definitely a must-have, it&rsquo;s also good for army-building Mysterio&rsquo;s drones if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re interested in. Highly recommend.</p>
