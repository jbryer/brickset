"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-30T07:00:43Z","only memories","i had this set, as i was a child. since they are many years left. at the time it was pretty cool, simple, but functionally. i loved the hood from the fire jeep, i don't know why. today it is a nice memory, but not more. in a time, when lego enter the era of high tech and x-special parts, this set is only a relic of the good old lego times, where the kids really need fantasy !!! there was another set, a helicopter, fitting to this set, but i never had a correct landing area. but ... the fun to build this set was bigger than today. 6382 comes from an other time, a time, where lego use that parts, they had. and they made a good job, finally.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-07T23:17:59Z","The best town sets","This is an example of the best town system sets released by lego. A great fire house with two garages with opening doors, a nice office for the woman mini figure and a room for the firemen. The pick up design is great, with opening doors and hood, and the truck with a lot of equipment for play with. Definitely an excellent set for this era, I still have it and deserves a 10, not just a 5 or at least under 8.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-03T23:14:57.937Z","Classic town lego at its best","When I was a kid during the 80's, I wanted this set more than any other. Unfortunately the opportunity never presented itself for whatever reason. A couple of years ago I finally managed to snag one on ebay. This is a great set with a fantastic old-fashioned design to the building. The use of garage doors is great, although the larger of the fire engines doesn't completely fit inside its garage. There are many nice features in the building design, particularly the use of windows throughout the building. I highly recommend this set and, in my humble opinion, there hasn't been a Fire Station since which has been able to match this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Beren","2007-04-09T05:23:20.147Z","One of the best from a classic era","This is one of my favourite sets. I love the inovations with the garage doors. I love the details in the offices - the chairs rotate and a computer. I love the trucks where they both have hose reels but use them very differently. Compare this to fire sets from a couple of years prior. It is near the beginning of an era of the great Lego town sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Standardqueso","2007-12-22T15:50:11.937Z","The best Fire Station of all times","Is amazing to see how Lego with the latest fire station (7945) just manage to get close to the brilliancy of the 6382. The following stations have not get close to the design. Looks like a real building!. The two garages with sliding doors and windows. With enough room for the minifigs, the two trucks (i live the No 1) are very funtional, and look real, with hoses, aqualungs, axes and space for firemans in the No 1. The minifigs with the beautiful helmet and their uniforms. Even came with its own plate. On the inside: office, computer, rotatin chair. But there is ne thing that I love so much: a LOT of bricks, the building is a building not like a modular prefabricated house like the new city sets. You have no idea how much fun I had whit this set when I was a kid.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2008-01-12T01:21:50.013Z","Still my favorite LEGOLAND set","I will always remember receiving this set from &quot;Santa&quot; in 1984 (little did I know how hard my parents had to search to find this since it was actually a few years old at the time).

Both vehicles are worthy of pride in your fire department (I felt bad for the minifig who had to drive the small truck with the Fire &amp; Rescue Squad #6366).  The smaller truck with this set is much more useful and the opening hood is a nice touch.  I always enjoyed the sliding garage doors, and this set also provides a huge number of classic red bricks (especially 1x2s) as well as windows and skylights that are useful for building other houses.  The upper floor office is a little sparse (just a bare desk and a swivel chair), but the use of classic small bricks for all of the wall sections more than makes up for it.

While the new #7945 Fire Station gives the firefighters two flat-panel computers and a coffee maker, it unfortunately uses large single bricks for most of the wall sections, which limits the possibilities for alternate structures (a common complaint I have with modern Lego sets).  While the new #7945 set has 600 pieces and #6382 has only 368, I feel that the older fire station provides more potential for creativity due to the higher count of smaller universal bricks.  This set also provides a somewhat rare female minifig, which is a nice touch.

My only complaint about this set is the large sticker which covers multiple bricks including the edge of a large flat plate on the front of the building.  However, once I had the sticker in place, my father used an x-acto knife to carefully cut the sticker along the seams of the bricks, which allowed me to use those bricks for other projects (as long as the side with the sticker was out of view).  Since each brick contained a section of the sticker, I could then reassemble the fire station using those same bricks for the front of the building and the large logo would reappear intact.

This set gets a 5 out of 5 rating from me.  It is still my favorite LEGOLAND set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-10T14:06:06.687Z","The Real Standard From Which All Fire Stations Have Been Built","As far as I'm concerned, this is the best fire station in existence.  Sure, the newer ones might include a few more playable elements like adding a helicopter pad.  But truthfully, they were all re-iterations of what this set has done and will continue to do for (seemingly) the rest of Lego's existence.  I've made it a clear point to collect every single Lego fire station in existence, so I have a rather strong opinion on this subject.

This station introduced us to the garage element.  From the juniorization period, the garage element was lost until the most recent fire station.  But it's always been a really nice element because of how this set introduced us to how the fire engines could be parked inside.

The station itself is very sturdy and well designed.  Nothing really fancy, but it's good looking.  I like the window elements on the garage sides as well as the black-red contrasting bricks around the base.  The little woman is the secretary working either on the ground floor (which has a cute office) or the second floor portion.

The thing that made me a huge fan of this set was the chief's car.  I don't think there's ever been a better looking or better designed fire truck in the series (just imo).  Even when I used to customize all my fire stations, the one constant was leaving the fire chief's car design intact because I loved it.  I liked the little front hood opening and the rear hose.  It just seemed like a cool design.

On a personal note (of many), I've been disappointed that since this fire station, there has not been any real transcendental designs.  No real epics.  Even the police stations have undergone massive changes.  But the fire stations have remained constant.  Most of these fire stations don't even have a place to rest the fire fighters and most never have gone beyond two trucks (only the REALLY old one in the 70's did so). To me that meant that Lego never exceeded the design of this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leeyore","2012-05-14T22:05:06.407Z","Not much I can add to past reviews... This set is Perfection.","<p>Certain sets, many from the 1980s, hit what I call the ""sweet spot"" of design and flexibility -- the ability to create something fun and visually appealing PLUS the ability to create any number of new creations.&nbsp; 6382 is right among the top few.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>+ A relatively simple but highly playable design that is still visually appealing after all these years<br></li><li>+ GREAT bricks for creating anything under the sun -- repair shop, storage facility, house, etc.&nbsp; One of the most flexible sets ever made.</li><li>+ Overall design serves as a solid teaching tool for future creations<br></li><li>+ Still looks appropriate among today's sets (except for the vehicles, see below)</li><li>+ Even the baseplate is wonderful -- makes a great ""pit"" area for a pair of racing teams<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- Vehicles are a bit clunky by today's standards, but they were a great step forward at the time -- and can be easily updated<br></li><li>- For the love of Pete, separately store those slotted 1x2 bricks for the sliding doors (Part No. 4216, in black x4 and red x24); otherwise, expect to go deaf from the repetitive aural stress of deep-searching Lego Rustle.&nbsp; Also, you may hear a yell from the other room: ""Building another sliding garage door?!""&nbsp; ""YEAH!""&nbsp; ""Can't find the slotted bricks?!""&nbsp; ""NO!""<br></li></ul>
<p>When you see the the the number of quality building parts and the number of ""specialty"" parts, you'll recognize how flexible this set is -- BUT WITHOUT those specialty parts limiting future design, creation and play.&nbsp; LEGO perfected the balance with this set.&nbsp; A must have.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"grobrick","2013-08-11T15:07:18.28Z","A new Era","<p>I just discovered this set in a 80's lot and spent a nice time building it.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Awesome design<br></li><li>2 garage rolling doors !<br></li><li>Transparent glass roof</li><li>Truck with unexpected hidden details<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Weaknesses in construction technichs that will be steps by steps removed in further lego sets.<br></li><li>Laying bricks on sleek road for 2 or 3 steps. A child would not manage it.</li><li>Hundreds of 2x1 bricks (columns of 10 2x1 bricks break when i tried laying the roof)</li><li>Enormous FireMen Sticker paste over a dozen of bricks, ouch! (I have seen many (Fort legoredo, etc) but this one is Guiness Record!<br></li></ul>
<p>This is one of the first major set of the minifig era: 1981. Everything is already there, detailed minifig with coulour patern, minifig scale building, and very nice and realistic design. Construction is interesting.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Niki124","2021-02-03T22:32:58.3Z","Classic design","<p>This was a stalwart of our Lego collection when we were growing up. This was my sister&#39;s Christmas present one year (mine was the police station) and she was adamant that it would not be broken up to be reassembled into alternative designs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to see why it&#39;s a classic. I used to wonder why real fire stations didn&#39;t look like this. The garages had full height windows on the side, transparent rolldown shutters, and skylights - clearly someone was expecting the engines to spend more time being polished than fighting fires. The office and upstairs bedroom were succinctly rendered, and the window blind stickers for the upper floor windows were a nice touch.</p>

<p>The engines are excellent too. No.1 engine may be the smaller of the two but comes well-equipped, while the heavy-duty No.2 engine has a fantastic and very sturdy double ladder. I remember we could stand the ladder almost vertical without any minifigures falling off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an ideal build for the novice Lego builder however. The initial layers of the building appear complicated as it&#39;s constructed to enable the building to cover a flat roadway section while incorporating the front door. The rolldown shutters and their housing can be fragile to handle. But it&#39;s a good build for anyone with a little experience, and some ambition and patience - the reward is definitely worth it.</p>
