<p>When I saw the Lego Star Wars magazine in a local shop I decided to take a chance and buy it in the hope that the figure within the packet on the front was one that I did not already own.</p>

<p>On my return to the house I opened the packet and started assembling the figure. A nice representation of a Snowtrooper, white helmet with black eye holes, dark tan hands, blaster, printed torso and legs, as seen on the front of the packet.&nbsp;To my surprise the head piece was&nbsp;a female and so I knew straight away I did not have this figure. Once assembled I really did like the look of it and now it sits in my collection&nbsp;with my other Snowtroopers.</p>

<p>I believe that the minifigure&nbsp;is actually SW1178 so for the price of the magazine was a good find for me and a bargain.&nbsp;</p>
