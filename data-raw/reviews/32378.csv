So with a proper discount, these windowy and overly plastic bag polluting sets come in handy.</p>

<p>Even though my main reason for buying are the minifigs, the builds can provide some nice small passtime as well. But this is where this HP-set falls short.</p>

<p>The figures are nice and aplenty (mini and microfigs) and even though some are copy pastes from the past, there are still some useful ones in there. Too bad however Lego keeps on using those pesky non bending kiddie legs. The medium ones are so much better.</p>

<p>When it comes to the minibuilds, it deserves commendation that there are some nice parts as well as prints in there. But the builds themselves, shelve them. I don&#39;t like microbuilds nor do I like greebling. I know that those calendars often rely heavily on those so I accept this. But the instruction flaps are too often dark/unclear. And even though I more than properly know my way around the HP IP, I still don&#39;t know what some microbuilds need to represent.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, a good way to get some (additional) figures. The rest can&#39;t wait to be used for an extensive training of the Obliviate spell.</p>
