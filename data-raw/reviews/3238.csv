"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-06T14:35:13Z","I rate it an 11","I love this set, one of my all-time favorites and a legend in my book (but please don't re-release it TLC).  
Call me selfish:)

One of the centerpieces of my town, it has great playability with an office, 2 garages with roller doors 
and a sliding crane (with working bucket) that goes between the gravel pit and the gravel hopper.  Then load up the articulated dump truck under the hopper and drive off to a building site anywhere in LegoTown!  And don't forget the small loader, 4 worker minifigs with tools and even some trees. 

I finally rebuilt it after all these years, and what a feeling of satisfaction to still have all of the red garage doors and yellow grooved pieces.  One of the sets I'm most proud of owning (since new), and one that I still thank my parents for!

If you want one today be prepared to PAY!!!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"uberpuma1","2008-06-26T12:58:13.61Z","My first...","This is the first Lego set I can remember.
My brother had Lego's and he is older, so this was one of his.
None the less, it had great features to it. The garage doors were my favorite, as they actually roll back up into the top of the garage. The crane is neat, but eventually broke from playing with it. Does anyone else wish that they would re-release some of these old cool sets as collectors?  I DO!

Pro's 
Tons of pieces, 
great mechanics (doors, crane, sliding rail, dump feature to load the truck)

Con's 
Lego's just dont last forever.

This set, along with the Cargo Center and Metro Park, were clear innovators.  Of course, there were and have been universal building sets similar to this one.  But I liked the fact that this set offered a place for your towns people to work, making me finally believe that outside of cops, fire fighters, the occasional nurse, gas attendant, the occasional airline crew and a few restaurants that the town people actually had jobs in their little world!

This set was the other set this year that provided the very unique and rare garage element.  But this one had it in red while the connecting bricks were in an equally rare yellow.  Two garages were provided for your dump truck and steam shovel.  There was a little office which I believe had a time clock that people could punch in and out of.  On top of the building, there slid around a gravel thingee (i forget what they might call this).  It was kinda cool because you had a neat little gravel yard that this gravel-thingee could grab and deposit in the dump truck.  There was a special little section, using the dump truck rear pieces, to deposit gravel too!

I managed to secure an incomplete version of this over ebay for a ridiculous sum of money.  That tells me that a set like this ought to have been sold again by Lego because it certainly is a classic in my book.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HappyStikBeaver","2010-03-24T00:33:04.31Z","My Favorite Town Set!","<p>I am lucky enough to have gotten this set, along with Coastal Rescue, Victory Lap Raceway, some police boat, the Cycle Fix-It Shop, a triple pack of Smuggler's Hayride, Flyercracker, and Star Quest, and Highway Patrol, all for around $25.&nbsp; Ha ha. That's why you go to garage sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This set has always been one of my favorites for many reasons, mainly because it gives&nbsp;all of your construction vehicles a place to go. It also has a nice design, and comes with many minifigures. You get&nbsp;a truck, a tractor,&nbsp;and a crane, plus that cool bucket that loads the dump truck. The baseplates are nice, and I love anything that comes with the garage doors! I also like the cool office under the crane tract. All of the assesories lead to good playability; I never get bored with this set! All together my favorite town set I own!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"mcjaco","2016-03-18T14:51:34.953Z","Your Lego Town Tax Dollars Hard at Work!","<p>Along with my other recent reviews of the sets I&#39;ve rebuilt in the past couple weeks, my kids have discovered my Lego stash, and Lego Town has been rebuilt. &nbsp;This would have been the forth Town set I accumulated, and probably my favorite of all time.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I no longer have the box, but the instructions we the usual for the time. &nbsp;Larger fold out booklet, with multiple pieces per step. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Oh the parts! &nbsp;First, there&#39;s the really awesome curved road plate, and then the doubley&nbsp;awesome garage road plate! &nbsp;The really shiney parts to this build is the traveling crane track, and ultimately the garage door track pieces (lots of 2x1), and the overhead track pieces. &nbsp;And of course, the roll up doors. &nbsp;Not to be out done, there&#39;s also the bucket for the front loader, the dumping bed for the dump truck, and the odd angled pieces for the gravel loader. &nbsp;There&#39;s also a&nbsp;handful of tools laying around for minifigs to use as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four minifigs, all in their&nbsp;blue button up shirt, red helmeted glory. &nbsp;I always wished one of them had a yellow or white helmet to demark&nbsp;which on was the Supervisor of this Public Works group. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build is quite simple, and a bit repetitious, once you get to the garage. &nbsp;As I said earlier, lots of garage track pieces in 2x1 stud form. &nbsp;My Father always liked this set, as it&#39;s really kind of built like a real flat roofed garage, with supports across the the ceiling to hold the roof on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The office is quaint, and simple. &nbsp;A chair, a desk, that&#39;s about it. &nbsp;I like the mini blind in the window, and the little arrow pointing down to the door, almost like saying, &quot;yoo hoo, the big red door is here!&quot; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The gravel loader is the challenging part with it&#39;s angled pieces, it rather complex leg structure, and it&#39;s attachment to the garage. &nbsp;Not too mention the cool slide out stopper for loading and unloading all those white 1 stud pieces of &quot;gravel&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dump truck is rather plain. &nbsp;There&#39;s no headlights or tail lights, just like the front loader. &nbsp;I&#39;m guess these aren&#39;t street legal for the rest of Town and are relegated to moving stuff back and forth here at the Public Works. &nbsp;That being said, they&#39;re simple builds, and additional pieces from stock could &quot;plus&quot; them easily (my son has already added a lever to the dump truck so the bed can be properly raised and lowered from the cab).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s really quite eye catching. &nbsp;The bright yellow and red, with a touch of blue, and the heavy black roofs. &nbsp;The garage, in it&#39;s simplicity, captures the look of a municipal building well. &nbsp;I love the wall of windows on each side. &nbsp;I used to have one minifig sit in the office just watching the other three (or the guys from down on Main Street joining them), steadily move gravel from the loader, to the storage area over and over. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is still my favorite of all the sets I had as a kid for Town. &nbsp;I loved construction, and this captured everything you needed to let it all happen anywhere in Town, or just daily maintenance chores at the Public Works, itself. &nbsp;The vehicles were simple, but have high playability, as does this whole set. &nbsp;The addition of the ultra cool garage doors, made this one special!</p>
