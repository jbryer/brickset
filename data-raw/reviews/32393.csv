"Hey_Its_Perry","2022-03-05T13:37:57.91Z","I should have waited for a sale","<p>I pre-ordered this right when it was announced a couple of months ago and in recent weeks debated cancelling that, however this shipped before I could do that.&nbsp; The overall build was made better doing with my son as there are a lot of parts that get very repetitive.&nbsp; The hammer is massive but feels a bit plain, some markings/wear (even if they needed to be stickers) would have been great.&nbsp; The actual hammer build took around 2 hours (while we watched the first Thor movie). I could have really done with the base, which took us another half hour to complete and really does not add much to the display.&nbsp; If anything, it makes me nervous displaying the hammer on it as it&#39;s just one big floor shake from falling and smashing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hammer is a great cosplay item that we had some fun posing with and while I highly recommend the set, I also strongly recommend waiting for a sale or clearance.</p>

"maharage923","2022-03-23T16:47:54.293Z","Best set ever","<p>This is a genius idea with near-perfect execution. As soon as I saw it I never swayed from deciding to buy it.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sturdy frame -&gt; tons of playability</li>
	<li>Looks great on display</li>
	<li>Probably as close to the movie design as could possibly be, great build</li>
	<li>Decent price, though some inner pieces could be consolidated without affecting function and the base is odd.</li>
	<li>An extra Thor, Infinity Gauntlet with all 6 stones, and FINALLY the way to do the Tesseract that I&#39;ve been hoping for since I handled a lego Minecraft head. Although maybe the sparkly/cloudy blue print like on the Patronus stag or CMF double-plate Tesseract would hide the center shaft better. Still really cool and nice to stock the collection with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>The circle on top protrudes a little more than I would like but small fixes are easy</li>
	<li>The strap doesn&#39;t fit on one&#39;s wrist, nor holds on well. The 3 4x4 round plates stacked are pointless when it could be a 4x4 round brick instead</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy modifications:</p>

<ul>
	<li>By adding 4 rows of 1-by-x plates inside the handle, it can be held or squeezed without the arches falling off.</li>
	<li>The seam underneath the bottom 2x6 tile facing the handle is both open and the blue bricks under are too visible. Change all 4 blue&nbsp;1x2 bricks to a pair of 1x8 light bluish gray bricks and you&#39;re set.</li>
</ul>

<p>PLEASE do more Infinity Saga sets. Maybe an Iron Man gauntlet with retractable missile launcher like in the first movie. Everything except the ugly mark 43 figure has been fantastic and I will buy them all. Also a chitauri battle pack with 4+ figures (ideally with the Endgame design) would be great, I would buy dozens</p>

"legoDad42","2022-07-10T01:29:54.37Z","Whosoever builds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Ole Kirk Christiansen!","<p><strong>Mj&ouml;lnir</strong> (pronounced &quot;me-owl-neer&quot;) was the mighty hammer of Thor, most beloved champion of the Norse gods.<br />
This version from Lego claims it to be from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it&#39;s more akin to the original Marvel Comics drawings, especially from those early Journey Into Mystery comics.<br />
The Marvel movie version has more ornate runic designs on the hammer-head (which can appear metallic), while the original comics version is more of a large grey chiselled stone hammer-head.</p>

<p><strong>PRO&#39;s...</strong></p>

<p>- Large 1:1 scaled toy prop. Almost the size of the movie prop (slightly longer than movie prop, but mallet-head just slightly smaller, hard to notice though).</p>

<p>- Quite sturdy with good weight and heft to model.</p>

<p>- Display base (holds hammer very well), w/trans-blue elements and exclusive printed plaque.</p>

<p>- Thor minifigure with exclusive torso (I believe).</p>

<p>- Bonus mini Odin&#39;s Vault (w/Eternal Flame, Infinity Gauntlet (w/all stones), Tesseract/Cosmic Cube)</p>

<p>- Only set with all the Infinity Stones with the Gauntlet and full complement of extra stones on sprue.</p>

<p>- New road-plate elements for display base.</p>

<p>- Multiple large light-bluish grey tile elements.</p>

<p>- Striking display piece.</p>

<p>- Fun to swing and play with. Kids will LOVE it.</p>

<p><strong>CON&#39;s...</strong></p>

<p>- No sticker or printed rune decorations for the hammer-head to mimic movie look.</p>

<p>- Curved elements on handle can shift slightly if held too hard towards the corner seams.</p>

<p>- Vidiyo strap just for decoration, can&#39;t hold or support weight of model. Also strap too short.</p>

<p>- Display base holds hammer well but loose connections here and there.</p>

<p>- Odin&#39;s Vault when put into hammer-head difficult to get back out.<br />

<em>Went with Bag 5 first to get the base done before the bigger hammer build.<br />
I think Lego should&#39;ve done Bag 5 first.<br />
Especially for kids cause you can get the base done quickly and the minifig so they have something to play with right away on terrain, then get into the longer hammer build. </em></p>

<p><em>Solid, sturdy inner structure for handle of the hammer.<br />
Kid&#39;s would need just some help getting the first layer of technic beams onto the inner core.<br />
The inner core can come apart when applying that first layer.</em></p>

<p><em>Another inner core build for the head portion of the hammer, and the outer skin applied to the handle.<br />
It&#39;s all solid but here and there when you hold the handle, some curved element move if you put pressure to the corner seams. Not a biggie but something to be aware of. Wish they found a way to lock it in more solidly. </em></p>

<p><em>You get an Infinity Gauntlet, ALL of the stones plus extras(!), flame elements and a nice trans-blue Minecraft head for the Tesseract (Cosmic Cube). </em></p>

<p>A mini/micro Odin&#39;s Vault (Odin&#39;s Treasure Room/Weapons Vault).<br />
It&#39;s cute and fun to have this extra. Especially the Infinity Gauntlet with all the stones (I believe this is the only set to have ALL the stones?) and very cool minecraft trans light blue head for the Cosmic Cube/Tesseract.</p>

<p>Now what&#39;s strange about this (and I&#39;ve only found like one online review questioning this), is that I believe this was never intended to be put inside the hammer.</p>

<p>- It&#39;s not in the instruction manual to do this. They have you display it outside the hammer.<br />
- It&#39;s only shown on the back of the box in a small photo.<br />
- Once you put it in, you can&#39;t retrieve the whole thing, only the elements themselves (on 2x2 jumper plates).<br />
- I don&#39;t believe Lego would make a build element you couldn&#39;t take in and out if that&#39;s the intention.</p>

<p>So I believe it&#39;s an either/or.<br />
You can leave it out to display with the hammer, OR, you put it in as an easter-egg when you open up the hammer. Just to look at within the hammer itself. You just can&#39;t get in there to pull it all out. You have to fiddle with it to get each element out.<br />
Plus Lego didn&#39;t mount the whole vault on a jumper, so I believe it&#39;s meant to stay in there.</p>

<p><em>Handle using a Vidiyo strap.<br />
Seems to look fine on display but I would&#39;ve preferred a longer strap.<br />
Of note: Can&#39;t hold hammer with strap. It&#39;ll come off easily. </em></p>

<p>You could display like this with Odin&#39;s Vault to the right hand side (or left side). Just need some extra elements (not included) to attach and match.</p>
