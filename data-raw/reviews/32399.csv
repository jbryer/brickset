<p>The build is very disappointing. The lower part is OK, while the upper part is too square, cannons rotate down on their own and the frontal piece, fells out of place and disproportionate.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;the minifigs are amazing! This Republic Tank comes with:</p>

<p>-Mace Windu (SW1205) is very similar to the UCS Gunship one, but this one has arm printing!;<br />
-Two 187th Legion Clone Troopers (SW1207): they don&#39;t come from some canon film/tv show/novel, but from some action figures. The figs are amazing;<br />
-187th Legion Clone Commander (SW1206) is a good figure, even if actually this isn&#39;t a commander but an airborne trooper. With a cloth over the legs would have been better;<br />
-Two common Battle Droids.</p>

<p>This set is a good set for kids, lacks of details on the top and has a great minifig selection. 7.5/10</p>

"Michaelgoal44","2022-08-23T18:50:30.077Z","Awesome Republic Fighter Tank","<p>I loved building the republic fighter tank. First the build is pretty cool. It uses good parts and has good play ability with the wheels on the bottom and the hatch on top that opens and closes. My favourite part about this set would have to be the mini figures though. The 187th legion troopers are super cool. They are not the most expansive mini fig but an army of 187th legion troopers would definitely be awesome.&nbsp;</p>

The build for the fighter tank is very inaccurate and very ugly, however it looks much better in person than it does on the box.&nbsp;On the other hand the figures are great the Mace Windu has great arm printing and the clones look amazing and we will probably never get them in another set ever again. Definitely worth picking up one for the figures at least and preferably when it is on sale.&nbsp;</p>

"Captainfives1514","2022-12-18T13:04:56.683Z","Mace Windu Returns ","<p>&nbsp; I always wanted to get a LEGO minifigure of Mace Windu, so when I saw this set I immediately knew I had to have it.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build isn&#39;t too special. For half of the time you&#39;re building two of the pointed armour panels on the sides which are repetitive. There are several interesting pieces in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Minifigures; Mace Windu is the crowning jewel of this set. The printing on his arms and torso are simply amazing. He is carrying of course his titular purple lightsaber.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 187th Airborne Commander; this trooper takes second place after his Jedi General. His helmet has several purple stripes on it. His printing on his torso is good. His armour&nbsp;has purple highlights and&nbsp;printed&nbsp;straps. His legs have a printed kama and trooper armour.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Two 187th Troopers; these two troopers share the same printing. Their armour has decals&nbsp;like those of the Coruscant Guard, with bandoleers and straps overtop their armour.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also included two battle droids with gunmetal blasters</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; This&nbsp;set is excellent for play, and is relatively cheap based on some other Star Wars sets,&nbsp;so army building is possible. I think overall this is an excellent LEGO Star Wars set.</p>

"Lord_Master_Macdonald","2023-01-09T22:57:32.963Z","The idea was there but lacks the pieces nor talent required for it to work.","<p>This is LEGO&#39;s third attempt at perfecting the TX-130 Saber Class Republic Tank, but this falls flat or to be more accurate, rises flat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: This includes a new Clone Wars era Mace Windu complete with printed wrist armour and a new frosted lightsaber&nbsp;blade. The three purple Legends era Clone Troopers are wonderful if you don&#39;t mind the lack of a waist cape on the Airborne Trooper. Two B1-Battledroids are also a nice inclusion.</p>

<p>Design: In many regards, this feels like a juniors set since many&nbsp;pieces used are&nbsp;huge. The use of the X-Wing&nbsp;windscreen piece is rather ingenious in trying to capture the 2005 design but the angles&nbsp;feel wasted juxtaposed to the oversized wall pieces either side giving the model too much height. The two red sides (not sure what their called) look far too wide probably because of the awkward height.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability: Whilst the turret atop the highest most&nbsp;seat on the in universe vehicle doesn&#39;t appear, the two lazily designed turrets either side can rotate back and forth easily and the option to fire the Spring Loaded Shooter is there. Whilst you can&#39;t put a minifig atop the tank and close the hatch, you can sit two Clones inside, although it&#39;s rather awkward.</p>

<p>Twelve stickers are used.</p>

<p>Overall, unless your interested in a Clone Wars Windu and purple Clones. I wouldn&#39;t recommend spending this much for this set.</p>
