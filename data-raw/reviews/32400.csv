<p>This set is created based on the scene from Star Wars Bad Batch animation film on Season 1, Episode 9 titled Bounty Lost where Omega was kidnapped by Cad Bane and Fennec Shand tried to take her away while the Bad Batch tried to rescue her.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/db281558-8006-443b-aacc-2549640b16e9/DSC06763.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>This LEGO Star Wars 75323 consists of a large spaceship named The Justifier owned by Cad Bane. This set also contains 4 minifigures and a droid. And there are also much weaponry, handcuff and treasure owned by Cad Bane.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/9cede44c-020a-4276-a1ee-f3fb1a0cb560/DSC06764.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see the minifigure on this set. From left to right they are: Hunter, Omega, Fennec Shand, Cad Bane and the droid Toro. There are also a pile of Cad Bane&#39;s treasure. We can see that Hunter is holding a commando knife, Omega is handcuffed, Fennec is holding a pistol blaster and suitcase while Cad Bane is dual wielding pistol blaster.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/24a48537-d0cd-4fda-ab73-de6aa24da9ab/DSC06765.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>We can see Hunter And Fennec Shand with hairs on their heads while Cad Bane has his hat removed. All the minifigure on this set have quite detailed torso on the front side and all the detailing are connected to the legs. Only the legs on Omega are plain without any detail.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/aab92829-0dce-40b0-b9bb-acbb4b1ea713/DSC06766.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The design on the back of the minifigures&#39; torso can be seen above. From all of them, we can see only Hunter&#39;s torso is the most detailed in terms of design.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/a01416cb-1fb3-4fc1-9a16-d3086ffa3d97/DSC06814.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>When the hairs are removed, we can see that Hunter, Omega and Fennec Shand have alternative expressions that can be used. The alternate expressions for Hunter and Omega are the faces full of tense and anger-like while the alternate expression of Fennec is full of scorn.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/59f34d18-b4c0-45b1-b4b2-b78835edabf1/DSC06769.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The Justifier spaceship is equipped with dual blasters on both the right and left wings. Like usual, this ship is also equipped with projectile launcher on both the left and right wings to simulate blaster shot. This ship has a wide wingspan and big overall size, and we will compare it with the Galaxy Explorer 10497 spaceship near the end of this review.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/7050dff4-f17f-49f9-bacf-8dae4b15ef85/DSC06770.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The top part of The Justifier&#39;s wing can be lifted. There are spare projectiles stored beneath the wings on both sides. We can also see all the LEGO Technic parts used to assemble the wings.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1660753185530-D91G1NBVMARPDBTIVZBS/DSC06776.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Above is the interior of The Justifier&#39;s cockpit. The interior is quite simple, there is only a single chair and computer console used by Cad Bane to pilot his spaceship. There is also a place for Cad Bane to hang his pistol blaster.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/9bb956e8-fc79-4a18-b336-099e391c1d6a/DSC06774.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Behind the chair, there are two crates to store Cad Bane&#39;s loot. The notable loot is a lightsaber which could be owned by Jedi captured by Cad Bane. The farther end is the force field used to incarcerate Omega. Unfortunately, this cell which is derived from the Bad Batch animation film is not in similar position with the film. The actual cell position is at the lower deck.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/c79784c1-2e3e-4479-abf6-1fdbbb1ba3f8/DSC06783.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Beneath the spaceship is simple and look a bit unsightly since there are sections on the ship that are not covered completely. On the tail section, we can see four thrusters used for take off and during flight. On the wing section, there are landing struts to keep the ship straight when it is landed.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/248c30cb-9138-40a3-9b3b-6f4e47334a72/DSC06779.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>On top side of both wings, there are greebling technique used by LEGO designer to add more details on the surface of both wings to visually increase the aesthetic value. Unfortunately, there are sections where the Technic components stood out which can be seen from the photo above. Those Technic components are being used for important feature below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1660780768878-THVB30EEXU1FRJ6MLYAK/DSC06782.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The Justifier&#39;s main feature is that the spaceship can be set in flight mode or landed mode. When we fold the tail upwards, both of the landing struts will be folded inside. On top of that, the thrusters on the tail will which used to assist the spaceship during take off will be used during flight mode. For better understanding, you can watch the video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwzPHQUAD6o&amp;t=466s"">here</a> or keep reading.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/f86c549d-0a62-40d5-be72-f1f0f5b94600/DSC06786.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see the position of the thrusters during landed mode. When the spaceship is taking off, these thrusters will assist in providing upward force by expelling&nbsp;energy downward.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/2a24d4e4-498e-487f-a544-0979d4bd8521/DSC06784.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>During flight, the thrusters on the tail which have changed their position will also provide more force to propel the spaceship forward in coordination with the thrusters located on both sides of the&nbsp;wing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/009d8810-936d-45f6-b5b9-7f086e0f762d/DSC06787.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see the thruster on one side of the wing. The green coloured tube shaped are the projectile. Below in the background (blurred/bokeh), we can see the landing thruster.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/afd794fa-5d3f-4a52-a121-d774c8422ada/DSC06796.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Cad Bane as a bounty hunter has amassed a lot of credit and prizes from his effort, and it is reflected from the pile of treasures. Sadly, he work mostly with the villains.</p>

<p>Another feature of The Justifier is the rigidity of the spaceship. The usual method of lifting this spaceship is by supporting beneath the wings or fuselage using both hands. However, this spaceship can also be carried by holding the front side or tail end like what you can watch from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwzPHQUAD6o&amp;t=376s"">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/8b2a8136-aae8-457f-9cfa-00205f3bbaf9/DSC06793.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The assembly booklet of this set have front and back covers with white colour. The pages inside the booklet is also dominated with white colour. Like what mentioned on the previous Star Wars set reviews, we can confirm that The LEGO Group will continue using white colour on the Star Wars instruction booklet</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/4a5b900a-eeb2-4df0-bbb4-e8e808d18ccb/DSC06798.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>We can see that The Justifier with one pilot have a nearly similar length with Galaxy Explorer set with 4 pilots. For the wingspan, The Justifier have a wider wingspan compared to the Galaxy Explorer.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Surprisingly, assembling spaceship this big does not take too much time. I was surprised how fast I can build this up.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Well, I wish we are given more parts, so we can cover up all the Technic parts on this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Children will be having difficulty in carrying this ship. It is easier for them to play the ship without carrying it. Adult will be having fun in playing with this set. Otherwise, just use it as display since this spaceship is quite large.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well I get this set for free. Unfortunately, this spaceship&nbsp;is quite costly (due to royalty paid to Disney) when compared to the set 10497 Galaxy Explorer.&nbsp;</p>
