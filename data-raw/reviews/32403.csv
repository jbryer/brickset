"AlkkuV","2023-01-05T13:15:30.22Z","Buy this set for the minifigs!","<p>So this was one of my only sets I built last year (don&#39;t know why) and I got it for Christmas. It was fun and easy to build and the minifigs were great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Box was the normal Star Wars box from 2022 and the art was nice. The box came with a sticker sheet and three numbered bags. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and had 103 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The build was nice and easy just like&nbsp;a 30 Euro set should be. There were two major flaws though. The body and the wings don&#39;t quite cope together and there is a little gap between them, which is very annoying. The second one is that the ship looks too bulky. That&#39;s because they wanted to have a space for R4&acute;s body when his head is on the spinning piece. It just doesn&#39;t&nbsp;look right. Otherwise, it was great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: The minifigs are the star of the show. They are all unique to this set. The set has three minifigs in total. The new version of Obi-Wan Kenobi, R4-P17 and Taun We. The first time that we see a Kaminoan which is great and because I&#39;m a huge Star Wars nerd I loved this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: There are nine unique parts in this set, but they are just the minifigure and droid parts. Otherewise, there are a couple of good green parts and a bunch of good red parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall review: I really liked this set, but the ship is pretty clunky. The minifigs&nbsp;are excellent and that&#39;s the only reason you should really buy this set. Taun We is just so good for a Star Wars collector. So overall I would give this set a 4/5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"DoctorDumbledore","2023-01-10T23:06:26.94Z","Another Great Ship","<p>Lego Star Wars disappointed me with several of the later releases of 2022 but 75333-1 Obi-Won Kenobi&#39;s Jedi Starfighter was not one of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></p>

<p>Obi-Wan has been made several times this year since his debut in the show sharing his name, but this Obi-Wan comes from the second film and is marvellous in printing and resemblance to the onscreen character, I especially like the hood that can be switched with the hair, his head also is wonderful featuring one with his cockpits headpiece and another without, which is nice for playability.</p>

<p><em>R4-P17</em></p>

<p>Even droids are wonderful in this set! R4 is a wonderful little astromech and shares similar printing to R2-D2, and I especially like the way they made the dark colours stand out on an already dark head.</p>

<p><em>Taun We</em></p>

<p>The best for last! Honestly this was the main reason I wanted this set, and I was not disappointed! Her skirt piece is wonderfully printed on front and back which is always nice. But the best part is her moulded head. I think it is wonderfully portrayed as compared to the onscreen character and stands a whole head taller than a minifig. 5 stars for Taun We and I hope they make the Prime Minister soon!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p><em>Pros</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great compared to the onscreen vehicle</li>
	<li>Makes great use of storage</li>
	<li>Quite sturdy</li>
	<li>Has nice accessories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cons</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stud shooters look awkward</li>
	<li>Is large compared to other Lego Star Wars spaceships</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Therefore, 75333-1 Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s Starfighter, is a great set and the price isn&#39;t that bad but would have been better sold for $19.99.</p>

"melvlee","2023-01-14T09:50:26.27Z","A bit of old and new","<p>I bought this set on a whim as it was on special and the assortment of dark red pieces attracted me.&nbsp; Not such a memorable ship from the movies but it certainly lends itself to a nice affordable set.</p>

<p>I really liked the new (to me) way the wings are attached in a very secure and stable way, without clips or hinges. The inverted slope pieces forming the stand on the underside offer a nice grip for swooshing.</p>

<p>The rest of the build is not that interesting, mostly just plates upon plates, except for a bit of SNOT work near the tail.</p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising with the variety of new wedge pieces and angled plates available that Lego haven&#39;t done more to replicate the sharp dart-shape of the ship.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ve never been that attracted to the use of the lime colour (contrasting with the dark red) in the colour scheme, which hasn&#39;t changed since the 2002 model. Maybe a new look at the colour scheme might also have made it feel more of a refresh.</p>

<p>All in all, a bit of new, but quite a bit of old.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2023-02-07T13:26:28.91Z","Welcome Master Jedi","<p>This is a pretty average Jedi star fighter. It includes a space for R4&#39;s body to fit into the ship while flying and includes a little satellite disk, so you can contact Coruscant which is cool. It looks very good other than the stud shooters, but those can be left off, and it looks kinda big in the middle where R4&#39;s body goes. The Taun We minifigure is a great first for the Kaminoans and is a very good mould. The Kenobi is very basic and is nothing special, however since they have started printing on the back of astromechs they opted not to on R4 for some reason which would have been cool for them to do. For $30 this is a average set however you will probably be able to find it on sale which is when you should get this set. Its not something I recommend everyone getting unless you want the Taun We figure. It is simply a good Lego Star Wars set.&nbsp;</p>
