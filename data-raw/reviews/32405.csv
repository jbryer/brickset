<p>This droid is the BD-1 droid that originates from the video game Jedi: Fallen Order. In the photo below, we can see the droid complete with the nameplate and the minifigure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/b4fbae37-b0bd-455d-b57b-93ced403ccc4/LEGO+75335+BD-1?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>Even though this droid is quite detailed and looks similar with the BD-1 in-game, it has limited playability. The legs are detailed with the greebling design on the legs. It even has wires that reflect what we have seen on the droid&#39;s legs in the video games.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658920204144-9MBYXLZFVRWIJ7SAWFIW/DSC06606.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>One of the limiting factor for playability is that this droid has limited poses. Mostly what can be posed is on the head. The joint between the neck to the head can be rotated which make the head able to tilt up or down in limited fashion. The head can also be tilted left and right. The head can not be fully rotated.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658879589305-QH8PMM7M17JX1G8KKNB1/DSC06609.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>The joints of the legs that connect to the torso can be rotated though this feature is mostly used to increase or decrease the height of the droid. We can not pose the droid in walking fashion. When the rotational position of the legs are not similar, the droid will topple over. The legs can only be rotated in similar position to make it standing well.</p>

<p>When looking at the back of the droid, on the head, there are a number of 1x1 rounded Trans tiles with two different colours to represent the lights as seen in the video game. The designer of this set also put enough effort to make the back of the droid still detailed enough.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658879771289-V013UWEAT9QHV9IT11AB/DSC06617.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>On the head section, the eyes on the left (when we face the droid) looks similar in the video games. It has the Trans blue colour. The eye on the right side does not look that similar though. Unfortunately, there are no special features on both eyes. On the side of the head, there is a slot that when opened will supply healing canisters. The antennae on both sides can be rotated in another direction.</p>

<p>The only sticker in this set is used on the nameplate. As usual, the nameplate contains the specification and information of the droid. There is a minifigure scale BD-1 droid supplied and place next to the nameplate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similar to what I have mentioned during my <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/64498"">review of set 75335</a>, the assembly booklet of this set is in white coloured cover. This make the booklet looks more exclusive while it also reduce the dark&nbsp;ink consumption as what The LEGO Group intended to be more environmental friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>If you like LEGO Technic, then you will feel at home! The entire structural assembly of the droid utilise Technic parts. But to those of you like myself that don&#39;t like Technic, then you have to bear with it while assembling the droid.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The part count is quite generous. I think this is the reason why this set looks like a replica of the BD-1 droid from the video game.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Not much playability. Only limited posture available from the droid. Definitely for display with its near similarity as an exact replica.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well I get this set for free. But judging on the price per part, it seems quite reasonable for a licence set. Maybe because this set is for display purpose. As usual with my regular advice, try to buy set whenever there is a discount or promo if you can wait for it.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2023-01-03T03:23:18.14Z","When will we get the Mantis","<p>This is a nearly perfect Lego set. The features included are great and are very game accurate and the scale is the same if nit similar to the scale ingame which is awesome. The figure of BD-1 is great as well. The only slight problem is the stability of the legs but as this is a display set it shouldn&#39;t be moved around often. I would highly suggest picking this set up.&nbsp;</p>
