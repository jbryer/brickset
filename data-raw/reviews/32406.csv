<p>Whilst not playing a huge role in Kenobi it ticks so many boxes, big, swooshable, impressive display, play functions and very, very black!</p>

<p>The build requires 8 bags and engaged me for a pleasant afternoon, lots of structure first but then coming together quickly with the last 2 bags. The amazing angles created for the front require some focus but are logical in construction and I&#39;d suggest most pre-teens with building experience would be fine.</p>

<p>The completed model looks impressive and much bigger than expected, there&#39;s a nice substantial feel when holding (whilst light enough to swoosh in one hand) which is right for quite an expensive set.</p>

<p>The interior is detailed, spacious and easily accessible even for big fingers and is a selling point for this set, no sense of compromises in designing a spacious interior vs the external aesthetics. I&#39;ve often felt cheated with the larger SW ships when trying to squeeze a couple of minifigs in, well with this there&#39;s ample room for all four figures and more.</p>

<p>The figures will be appealing for legends fans with both the grand inquisitor and fifth brother as well as the third sister introduced in Kenobi. All 3 are good prints and with the middle-aged Kenobi included there&#39;s scope for play &amp; display.</p>

<p>It is a pricey set but I felt I&#39;d got value for money and can highly recommend as one of the best 2022 wave.</p>
