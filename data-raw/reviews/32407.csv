"Knightmares","2022-08-08T07:37:51.353Z","The 2022 AT-TE... The Best Yet?","<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>The Lego Star Wars set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75337-1/AT-TE-Walker"">75337</a>&nbsp;AT-TE Walker from 2022 is spectacular. The set includes 5 minfigures, 3 battle droids, and a spider droid, as well as the AT-TE walker itself. It is based on the scene from the third movie in the prequel trilogy of star wars, revenge of the sith, in which Commander Cody attacks Obi-Wan Kenobi on Utapau as a result of order 66. The set just falls short of being perfect, and the reasons for that will be listed below.</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>This set&#39;s building experience will be great for some people, but not so great for others. The base of the walker, particularly the second and third bags involve the use of&nbsp;numerous technic elements to ensure structural integrity. Whilst being necessary, it does make for a different and somewhat lacking building experience. The build is also quite repetitive, mostly because of the six feet and four side plates that are all extremely similar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>The parts included in 75337 are quite useful. Some notable pieces include two of part&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6351905/plate-1x5"">6351905</a>&nbsp;(1x5 plate) in tan, and 40 of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6163990/tile-2x2-w-bow"">6163990</a>&nbsp;(Tile 2x2 with bow) in light bluish grey. There are also plenty of technic elements for any technic fans who are interested in purchasing this set. The set also includes a pack of visors and rangefinders that can be used as extra attachments for the clone troopers.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>This set has a lot of play features that kids will enjoy. The cannon on the top of the set has 2 stud shooters, and can spin 360 degrees. The middle legs on either side can be moved into various positions to simulate movement, and the 6 ball turrets on the walker can move in many directions. There is also a carry handle located in the centre of the walker to allow it to be picked up and moved more efficiently. Overall, this set is filled with fun features kids will love.</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>This set contains 5 minifigures. These include the likes of phase 2 Commander Cody which has been a highly requested minifigure by the Lego Star Wars community for a long time. The other figures in this set are three 212th legion clone troopers and a clone gunner. The minifigure selection was&nbsp;almost perfect, however would have been improved greatly with the inclusion of an episode 3 Obi-Wan Kenobi minifigure and a palpatine hologram piece for Commander Cody. The rangefinder attachments seem to fall out after too much movement in the helmet holes on the clone trooper minifigures, so be aware. Additionally, the 212th legion troopers have inaccurately printed helmets as the triangle does not come to a point. This does not bother me too much but to some people it will.</p>

<p>People also make the point that they will buy a lot of this set as it is very army buildable, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great idea. This set is 140 US dollars and buying it just for the minifigures is essentially paying 7 times the price of a battle pack for 1 extra named character and an extra battle droid. I do not recommend army building this set, and please take this into consideration&nbsp;before&nbsp;doing so.</p>

<p>The Price:</p>

<p>This set has been priced at 140 USD or&nbsp;230 AUD at retail. However, ebay resellers&nbsp;have been selling this set for between 250&nbsp;and 350 AUD. You do the math. <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AUD-USD?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbl_uWzLb5AhUvZWwGHVz6CboQmY0JegQIAhAb"">Here&#39;s a link to the exchange rate.</a>&nbsp;This set feels slightly overpriced however purchasing it as soon as possible is a smart idea as it is likely to sell out fast, and the price&nbsp;will likely skyrocket upon its retirement.</p>

<p>Overall Thoughts:</p>

<p>This set is very good. All that is missing is the correct printing on the 212th legion troopers, and the Obi-Wan minifigure and a palpatine hologram piece for Cody. The model of the walker is easily the best one yet, boasting an expansive interior, and space for up to 9 clone troopers in the seats provided (you could fit more in, but I&nbsp;don&#39;t recommend it as it becomes extremely difficult to take them out). I personally do not mind that they included a spider droid instead of a crab droid, however I see why people would have rather had a crab droid. Overall, this set is a 9.5/10 and a welcome addition to my collection.</p>

<p>This is my first review on brickset, so if it isn&#39;t helpful to you, I&#39;m sorry and will hopefully do a better job on other sets in the future.</p>

<p>This set is derived from the Battle of Utapau where after Commander Cody received Order 66, he instructed the AT-TE Walker main cannon to blast Obi Wan Kenobi.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/e7d8f750-0d6e-4b87-bc28-9e4f1c28e962/DSC06752.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>This set is the latest AT-TE Walker which is launched on 1st of August 2022 which consists of the AT-TE Walker itself, 5 clone troopers, three B1 series Separatist droids and one Dwarf spider droid. There are various of interesting feature on this AT-TE Walker. Notably, there is the main cannon, 4 ball turrets at the front side and two ball turrets at the rear side.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/58d5fbe5-cbc3-4b86-bfaf-19a5cd975621/DSC06749.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Front the photo above, there is a group of clone troopers from the 212th attack battalion with 5 troopers. From the separatist side, there is one menacing dwarf spider droid and three B1-series battle droids to fight the clone troopers. I would say the separatist on this set are doomed to fight the clone troopers with their AT-TE Walker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/580cb5ca-8e61-4819-9c99-b971985eec90/DSC06746.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the Battalion 212th Clone Trooper (from left to right): Two troopers with long barrelled blaster rifles, a trooper with short barrelled blaster rifle, a gunner with pistol blaster and Commander Cody with short barrelled rifle. Beside Commander Cody, the troopers have similar expression (well, they are clones). Their torsos are nicely coloured.</p>

<p>.<img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/8c735cd6-b8a2-42e5-b75e-df233570e089/DSC06738.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the rear, these clone troopers do not have alternative expression. Their torso also still highly detailed. The helmets are nicely coloured with different colours between the troopers with the gunner and with Commander Cody.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/ccbcf018-57b8-40fe-98df-804c069e9d8e/image-asset.jpeg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The photo above is where we completely open the AT-TE Walker. We can see the entire interior of it. On the rear side, we can see the lone seat for the rear turrets&#39; gunner. There are more seats for the clone troopers to sit. In the front side, we can see another two seats for the mechanics and the front side is the main control room for the AT-TE Walker pilot.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/a687a23b-1de5-4cc7-9b56-343c68f95248/DSC06718.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Let us look closer to the rear&#39;s interior. We can see clearly the seat for the rear turrets&#39; gunner. There are four seats for the troopers to wait until they reach the battlefield for deployment. From the photo above we can see two clone troopers are waiting patiently on their seat while the turrets&#39; gunner is on standby. There is also a rifle rack to store the long barrelled rifle blasters.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/334ed8fb-55e9-4812-a785-9d102332e9b5/DSC06724.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The rack to store the long barrelled rifle blasters is very simple to build. It only consists of 4 different parts. Too bad the there is only one storage rack to store two long barrelled rifle blasters. I wonder where to store the short barrelled rifle blasters and the pistol blasters.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/4cda3947-eb43-42d8-9dff-57349a090fc5/DSC06721.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The front side of the AT-TE Walker can be viewed above. There is only two seats for the clone trooper to sit. We can see the four ball turrets. One of the ball turret is being clearly shown. I need to tell you that the long barrel part is easily detached when you want to re-orient the angle of the turret. It is better to detach the barrel when you want to re-orientate the aim.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/2bb2e4eb-8eaa-4404-a863-71ae4e89ab9b/DSC06725.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The cockpit in the AT-TE Walker is very simple as shown above. There is only one seat with two levers to control the AT-TE Walker movement. There are glass on the front side to look into the battlefield.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/4f32eb11-5a0e-48ec-b671-db33c1fc62b0/DSC06753.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The feet of the walkers are very flexible while the legs are more limited in terms of rotation. The legs on the front side and back side can only rotate around 10 degree angles while the legs on the middle section can rotate around 45-60 degree angles. Those legs function to withstand the weight of the AT-TE nicely.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1660232145830-7B8IR4VPU996D0I5918I/DSC06755.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>One of the neat feature on this set is that there is a sort of hanger or lever that you can use to pick up the AT-TE easily as shown on the photo above.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1660232147364-YJ6NKPBS8CU2ASEXB9PR/DSC06756.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>You can also carry it this way. Anything that floats your boat!</p>

<p>I just wonder why Obi Wan Kenobi is not included in this set. I would rather exchange the three B1-series battle droids and the dwarf spider droid with Obi Wan Kenobi and the wingless lizard that he was riding on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is a fun building experience for me. This is the first time I build any LEGO Star Wars walker. And the joy is building up when I am nearing completion. And it looks a lot better than set&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7675-1/AT-TE-Walker"">7675</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set has more parts compared to its predecessor which is set 7675. The 5 clone troopers are all great.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Well, there are many ways you can play this set with. If you give this to children that is familiar with Star Wars or even the animation film the Clone Wars, they will definitely be having fun with this set. Even when displayed this set will still look awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well I get this set for free. But I think the cost of this set just a bit high. As usual, if you can wait, just wait until there is a discount or VIP double point before getting this set.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-star-wars-75337-at-te-walker-review-dalam-bahasa-indonesia"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

"StarKiller22515","2023-01-01T23:23:20.46Z","An Almost Perfect Set","<p>This AT-TE is the best one we have ever gotten and includes a lot of clones like an AT-TE should. The build is perfect, the commander Cod figure we always wanted is perfect, the clone gunner is perfect, the battledroids are great. The only two problems are that we got a spider droid instead of a crab droid which is inaccurate to the scene, and that the printing on the 212th helmets is shifted down at the top giving them an inaccurate look.&nbsp;</p>

"Captainfives1514","2022-12-18T12:36:37.227Z","The Ultimate AT-TE","<p>&nbsp; I have collected LEGOs for over a decade now. I remember the second AT-TE that was made in 2008 set 7675. I like many other kids really wanted that set. I actually got it for Christmas one year. At first, I was elated, but after I started playing with the set I noticed some glaring deficiencies. The legs fell off as well as the exterior armour came loose a lot of the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp; So when I saw the new AT-TE I knew I had to get it. I got it for my birthday last month, and it proved to be just as amazing as I had imagined.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build was pretty straight forward. A bit repetitive of course on the legs. As far as stability goes it is great no more legs falling off or armour plating coming loose. Also the usual glaring problem of most LEGO sets that there is no room for a lot of minifigures is not the problem here. You can fit seven minifigs at least,&nbsp;more if you cram them in there. The turret has almost a 360 degree range of motion.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Problems; The&nbsp;most obvious problems&nbsp;are that the main gun can&#39;t elevate so unless your shooting at something taller than the AT-TE or objects that are&nbsp;three feet away from the AT-TE.&nbsp;If you don&#39;t the&nbsp;shot will just fly harmlessly over their heads. The clone gunner is also not secured to the turret in any way so he tends to fall off unless you modify the turret.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The minifigures; The crowning jewel of this set is obviously Commander Cody in his phase II armor.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The detail on this minifigure is superb.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The three Two hundred and twelfth attack battalion clone troopers are also are extremely detailed and look amazing.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The Clone Gunner is one of my personal favourite. Since one of my first LEGO set included the phase one clone gunner in the 8014 Clone Walker Battle Pack. The details on this minifigure are also superb.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The three battle droids are your regular LEGO battle droids except for the inclusion of gunmetal colored blasters the carry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The dwarf spider droid is also excellent. A nice addition to the droid forces in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Price; The price per piece of this set is about 11cents per piece. Since the 7675 which was priced then at 8 cents a piece, so apparently inflation has driven up the price. I still think buying this set now is better than buying one of the older AT-TEs now. Since they are generally&nbsp;the price of the new AT-TE,&nbsp;or even twice the price&nbsp;used. Two or three&nbsp;times the price if they are&nbsp;new.</p>

"BobaFettsDayOff","2022-09-08T02:40:22.12Z","The Pinnacle of the Lego Star Wars Renaissance ","<p>Just picked up the brand new AT-TE yesterday and it is definitely worth all hype!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting off the minifigs, what else can I say? Pretty much a perfect figure selection, 3 212th troopers are a welcome addition. That clone gunner isn&#39;t that bad either. So are 3 battle droids. But let&#39;s be real here, we&#39;re all here for that phase 2 Commander Cody. Perfect figure all around, nothing else to say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beast itself: it is a lot bulkier in person. This picture doesn&#39;t do it justice. Much bigger than I thought, I am very satisfied with the overall product. The detailing on this is impeccable especially with newly designed legs, gives it a lot more character and much stronger connection compared to previous versions. The interior is arguably one of the greatest interiors we&#39;ve ever gotten in a Lego SW set. Plenty of seats (7 total) and with those removable weapon racks/crates, you can fit up to 15 troopers in there! Takes some squeezing and a tight space but it is possible! The back plate is easy to open, and the front cockpit has a strong connection. My 1 problem with this set is that the front part of the cockpit tends to break very easily whenever I open it. Not sure if this is just me or if other people are experiencing this issue. The top cannon is also very well designed, pivots nicely with good range. And the new stud shooters aren&#39;t so bad as I thought. Can be a bit of an eyesore but I&#39;ve seen worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the most hyped summer set is definitely worth it. $140 is pricey but it is justified (the same can&#39;t be said about the $170 Jusifier). 9/10&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*edit* this is my 1st ever review on Brickset. I apologize if this isn&#39;t the greatest or most thorough review but I will my hardest going forward to improve my future reviews&nbsp;</p>

"CommanderCody05","2022-09-30T00:58:41.44Z","A Pure Masterpiece!","<p>WARNING, this will be a lengthy review.</p>

<p>After my last review, I decided to review something I really like(I still don&#39;t know why people didn&#39;t like my last one). When this was revealed during the summer, I started to save up and a month ago I bought this from a local brick shop for $150.00.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURE:</p>

<p>&nbsp; Republic Forces. To start this off, I will begin with one of my favourite Star Wars characters, Commander Cody.To have a Phase 2 Commander Cody is like a dream come true to many Star Wars fans, myself include. The helmet is more detailed than most, and it even shows battle scars as does the rest of his body.I do wish that they would have given him arm prints.The designer really payed attention to detail which is shown the most in the various markings on the legs and even on the torso. I have heard some complains on the new design of the 212th trooper and I really don&#39;t see why. They are extremely detailed and vibrant. I am also glad to see that there are holes in the sides of the helmets for visors and rangefinders. The gunner really benefits from this, for he looks sharp with a visor on. I still can&#39;t get over the fact that these figures are soooo richly detailed, my hat is off to the designer.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Separatists. In this set you will find 3 battle droids and a spider droid. The battle droids are nothing to write home about and I think they should have included 2 more. I was very disappointed when I saw that there was no crab droid but to my surprise, the spider droid is growing on me. It is sized very well, and I love that there are NO STUD SHOOTERS!!!!!! One either loves &#39;em or hates &#39;em. The antenna piece was a smart piece to use too.</p>

<p>FINALLY, THE MODEL:</p>

<p>&nbsp; It is time for the much anticipated part of the review. The construction of the walker was what surprise me the most. It was challenging, yet not too difficult to the point where I was disinterested. I am glad to report that none of the pieces broke during construction, and it has held up for a month so far. The inside can seat up to 6 clone troopers, a pilot, and a gunner on top. Inside also has room for blasters and a crate of grenades. That said, I really wish there were more seats.Once complete, the AT-TE looks a lot like its on-screen counterpart. It makes a great display piece. As for the playability factor, I can&#39;t comment on that for I don&#39;t play with these; I only display, collect, and occasionally MOC. My brother did do a stop-motion video for Journey-separate ways with it (for those interested, it may be put on YouTube sometime next year, probably March).</p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>

<p>&nbsp; I am very much please with this set, and I was glad I got it, seeing that I missed the last one. I believe when you buy it, you will not be disappointed. It offers a great building experience and exceptional characters.If I was you all, I would buy this before it goes out of stock and retires. You will not get another chance for 8 more years.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Thank you for reading,</p>
