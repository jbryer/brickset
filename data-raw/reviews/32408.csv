<p>The ship on this set is called Mobile Tac-Pod. It looks small, but don&#39;t let the small size fools you. This ship is quite sturdy as it uses a lot of Technic parts as it structure inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/84dfe3ba-3a37-48f5-8765-5604b3641316/LEGO+75338+Ambush+on+Ferrix?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>This set is consisting of the Mobile Tac-Pod spaceship, a speeder bike, 3 Minifigures with hand blasters, a fire extinguisher, a box and a number of 1 x 1 Trans green rounded tiles as bullets for the dual stud shooters above the ship.</p>

<p>The Minifigures on this set are (from left to right):&nbsp;Syril Karn, Luthen Rael and&nbsp;Cassian Andor. Both Luthen and Cassian have their printed torsos in conjunction with their legs. While Syril only have a printed torso.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/f5f642de-c2da-44c0-9c9e-0b6c340483d6/LEGO+75338+Minifigures?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>While on the backside, we can see the three Minifigures also have simpler printed torsos but not printed legs. Only Luthen and Cassian have alternate expressions while Syril does not have alternate expression.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/afda65d5-7eac-4740-bcb5-ccd061b6f86d/DSC06593.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>This Mobile Tac-Pod spaceship has wings that can be directed upwards or downwards. In the photo above, we can see that the wings are folded downward. This spaceship is equipped with two blaster cannons located above the spaceship and in forward bottom section.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/33b383d0-6edc-4e44-bfb7-a1b8e7aa71af/LEGO+75338?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see the position when the wings are folded up and the upper blaster cannon and spaceship canopy are also folded up. Both of the side doors are lowered and the spaceship&#39;s cockpit become accessible from either left or right side. There is not much thing on the interior of the spaceship though.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/5d0e8395-2dec-413b-82b4-93ed02c4909e/LEGO+75338?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>On the rear side of the Mobile Tac-Pod, we can see a not so big cargo bay. One from two interesting things on this spaceship is despite its small stature, this ship is very rigid due to a lot of Technic parts used on its inner frame assembly to reinforce the overall structural integrity.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/cd041f0f-296f-47d0-97cc-c6802190146e/LEGO+Star+Wars+Mobile+Tac-Pod?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The second unique point of this set is the assembly of this triangular section on the front side. It utilises a very creative way in getting it right. It looks very clean and creative.The overall appearance of the spaceship could be better if most studs were covered with tiles.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/56cb5502-d660-4dd7-bead-4db405280285/LEGO+Mobile+Tac-Pod?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>One of the negative point of this set is when you raise the spaceship and look at the bottom side, we will find colourful parts used on the inner frame. This made the ship not realistic enough. The designer should use more colour compatible parts on the bottom section.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/9f2ebeed-e396-451e-bbd0-591c20fd7164/LEGO+Ambush+on+Ferrix?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Lastly, I like the white coloured assembly instruction booklet. It makes the appearance more brighter, clean and more exclusive. I think this is one of the way of TLG to reduce waste from using too much black ink.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is a nice ship, but I am not fond of assembling Technic parts with so many pins.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>You would not believe that spaceship this small will use a lot of parts. The parts are mostly to strengthen the structural integrity.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Children will definitely glad to play with spaceship. I know my son will. He would ask me to play with him along with the rest of our Star Wars sets for battle scene.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much since I get this set for free. But by looking at the price, it is quite reasonable (for a licensed set). The Mobile Tac-Pod might look small, but it is very rigid.</p>

"Zakalwe72","2022-08-29T19:42:45.977Z","A great Star wars unknown","<p>I&#39;m not going to provide a comprehensive review as I&#39;m sure others will provide a better critique but I was so impressed with this build and as a set that&#39;s had a few pelters I wanted to provide some balance.</p>

<p>Its an unknown vehicle as at the time of reviewing Andor is still 20 plus days from debuting. A brief glimpse in the trailer suggests the tac pod will be a recurring ship and looks accurate from the little shown. I&#39;m sure the designer will have had more original content to work with&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is excellent, it comes together in a very logical but enjoyable way and the six bags of parts feels right. The stickers aren&#39;t arduous to add but add a lot of nice aesthetics to the final look, especially the internal controls. I took my time and built at leisure in a few hours.</p>

<p>The minifigures (Barry Gibb &amp; Woody Harrelson) plus other are ok but not a deal breaker. Likewise the speeder bike is surprisingly good but not sure it adds much to the set&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final build is very, very good with a great look and a sense of completeness and attention to detail which makes this a good buy. Its one of those sets in which the vision and class flows, casual Lego staples like gaps between sections and moving parts are managed beautifully and it&#39;s just a tight, well designed build&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this with VIP points so only cost &pound;20 but I appreciate the premium price point may turn people away but if you can get this for 10 or 20% off then I&#39;d highly recommend. Its not a usual Star wars build which always attracts me and the experience, techniques employed and final look of the set are excellent.</p>
