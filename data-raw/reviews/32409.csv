The Darth Vader had the coolest torso in my opinion with the tie fighters and the death star on Scarif. The R2 has exclusive printing even on the back which is cool. Most of the builds were very good this year and there are few that make you not want to pick this up. With the price increase of $5 it is still worth it as the quality of the builds and the prints increased this year. However, make sure that you got the correct builds and figures as there have been lots of problems with people getting the wrong stuff in each day on the calendar.&nbsp;</p>
