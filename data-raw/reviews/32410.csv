The human inside was the final weakness to be solved","<p>While it is not a helmet it is still a part of the helmet line which is acceptable for me. The front of the face looks great and the detail looks good around the sides and on the back as&nbsp;well. The continuation of the face lower than normal is done well. The only thing that does not look very good is the top part of the head which is very smooth in the show but is completely studded here. There was no way for them to tile the whole head so its understandable as to why its studded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completed helmet is spectacular, a lot of criticism around this helmet, I love it, each to their own</p>
