"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-04T14:05:50Z","Wow","This was my first Lego set. Now I have lost some pieces but the majority of them are still here. What I love about the this set was the entertainment value that I enjoyed when playing with it. While it may be simple it is still fun to put together, no matter what combination of pieces you put down. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-10-28T03:38:55.56Z","Interesting HQ","The building is kind of minimalist; one room? Does have my favorite helicopter design, one that I copied regularly whenever I made my own. The otehr vehciles are good quality too. Come to think of it the whole set seems to have been built around the vehicles, even right down to the plate itself. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LegoPoliceFan","2009-04-17T21:22:45.013Z","Lego got this one right.","This is a great lego set.  While at glance it may appear simple, there is much finesse when it comes to the design.  From the vehicles to the building to even the plate itself, everything is unique and very identifiable to this set.  The number of vehicles you get is one of the best features.  There is great potential for the amount of play this set offers.

I hold this set in high regard and I intend on rebuilding it at some point in the future.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"albcheng123","2009-09-18T12:21:15.187Z","A True Classic","Can't stop myself from writing a review on the set after I bidded a box-set at online auction at a decent price.

According to internet information, the set should be the first ""coast guard base"" model with ""coast-guard logo"".

With 4 smilely coast-guard minifigs, 2 vehicles, one helicopter and a speedy boat, the ""coastal rescue base"" should be well-prepared to implement their operations ---- coastal patrol, search & rescue and any other you may imagine along the coast.

Interesting to say, the ""coastal rescue base"" fit quite well to play with other coastal &/or leisure themes between mid-80s to mid 90s, such as:
- Pier Police (6540)
- Breezeway Cafe (10037 / 6376)
- Pizza to Go (10036 / 6350)
- Vacation Hideaway (6592)
- Holiday Home with Campervan (6388)

The Pier police and coastal guards ensure the safety and security around the leisure area while the cheerful minifigs are enjoying their holiday along the coastal area.  

The beach sunset should be very charming, agree?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dahhunter","2012-11-16T09:49:59.677Z","All the Vehicles you could want","<p>This was one of my first lego sets and i loved it. The Helicopter was great, the Boat, with the Tip up motor was awesome. I liked the Base Plate as it had 3 different parking stalls on it.. so i could build whatever i wanted.. &nbsp;My only beef is i&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;really like the single one room office. however it was 1989 so thats not a huge deal.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Helicopter</li><li>Boat with Tip up motor</li><li>Car, Truck and Trailer</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Single Room office</li><li>The Clear Plastic Glass from the windows got loose and were&nbsp;easily&nbsp;lost</li></ul>
<p>All in all this is a great set and looks awesome as part of a lego city</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A few great printed parts in here and a baseplate!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Somewhat generic minifgs by today&#39;s standards.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Recall it fondly - the vehicles, the helicopter, and the station.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Helicopter was probably my favorite aspect of the set as a kid. And the truck and tractor with rescue boat.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Classic Lego gold.&nbsp;</p>
