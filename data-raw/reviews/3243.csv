"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T10:17:05.123Z","An adorable set","The holiday home is a detailed and fun set. The main attraction is the bungalow, which has a small but detailed interior, including a kitchenette and coffee maker. Like most Lego buildings, it has no back wall - while this makes the set easire to play with, it also means you can only really display the set from one angle. Outside, there is a small garden with a stylish barbecue and outdoor dinner table. The flowers and tree add a very natural touch.

Also included are no less than four vehicles: a fairly standard sedan, a camper with bicycle and a small speed boat on a trailer. The camper looks great on the outside, though the inside is, unsurprisingly, extremely cramped. Still, the tap and lunch table are interesting details. 

All in all, the holiday home is a feature-rich set that should keep any child entertained for hours. Perhaps the theme is not very exciting, but the execution is solid.

The interior of the trailer is especially well-detailed.  Though the house looks nice and its interior is detailed, its size seems to have been sacrificed somewhat in favour of the vehicles.  Still, it looks very exotic, and you can imagine it in a leafy glade or overlooking the sea.

"villicus","2008-04-18T11:37:37.53Z","lot of details","One of the later living houses. Its fascinating to see how Lego has added more and more details in this sets, you have an ashcan, coals on the BBQ, a glass for every minifig in the set (and even one extra cup in the van!), lot of vehicles, even a coffee machine. Funny to see how the same brick can be some motor for the boat or a coffee machine, and it does work all the time. A good place for your minifigs to have a private party, great set. Get it if you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The design of the bungalow and&nbsp;barbecue&nbsp;hark to 1980's Americana getaway as well as European retreats that may nestle by a lakeside among other purpose built homes. At any rate it's a lovely, classic design.</div><div><br></div><div>The camper is great as there are three latches that open and close very smoothly and really open up the inside detail. Simple bicycle, car and small speed boat add to the ideal that you don't need money to enjoy life.</div><div><br></div><div>A top-rated set, buy it!</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"Cloveious","2017-05-19T06:08:43.843Z","Amazing set","<p>I got this set circa 1989 and it has always been one of my favorites. I was big into the mid / late 80&#39;s legoland town theme around that time. I had the Shell Station, Airport, Railroad, Police and Fire Stations but never anywhere for my mini figures to live.</p>

<p>To be honest the younger 1980&#39;s me&nbsp; never thought of this as a holiday vacation home. It was just a really nifty house with lots of vehicles.</p>

<p>I loved the detail. This set had so much of it that I dreamed about looking at the Lego 250 ideas book. Glasses, appliances and yard accessories.</p>

<p>I felt bad for years because I broke the handle bars off the Lego Bike and had no way to actually replace it until recently when I discovered you could order a new bike off Bricks and Pieces after I came out of my Lego dark age.</p>

<p>As far as vehicles go the RV was my favourite Legoland Town vehicle of all time.The big windows, moon roof, bike attachment and trailer hitch made it seem so modern like so much was going on. You also get a car, a boat and a bike.</p>

<p>The details in the house were amazing from the translucent plates in the fire place to make a fire, the very modern kitchen, the table for four. The flora around the home. The use of old and new parts made it feel like an old home updated for modern times. I loved the back wall and covered extension to the home.</p>

<p>The set also has a B model with no instructions that can be built. However I never tried it as I thought it looked kinda tacky.</p>

<p>This house and accessories ignited my imagination in everyway shape and form.</p>
