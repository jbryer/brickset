<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Now, the Crystalized wave is obviously going to be one of the most popular and desirable Ninjago waves of all time. I was excited for so many sets this wave, but this set wasn&#39;t initially one of the ones I was over the moon for. I&#39;d say I like this set, but what you see is what you get.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The build experience was just fine, I finished it in around 10 minutes, so it&#39;s not very substantial, but great for little kids.</p>

<p>The build itself is quite tiny, taking up very little space. There are no unsightly colours and I take pleasure in the dragon theme present all over the bike. The dragon head is the highlight of this build, although the chomping function isn&#39;t very elaborate. The bike looks very solid all-around, although the lack of many play features may damage its appeal to smaller kids.</p>

<p>The crystal spider looks alright, however, it is far too large in comparison to its TV show counterpart. Still, it&#39;s not difficult to make modifications and allows for easy play.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Golden Dragon Jay may be my least favourite of the dragon ninja, but he still looks excellent. The transparent elements look incredible, but I especially like the metallic touches used to accentuate the lightning on his torso. I&#39;m glad that I was able to complete this incredible collection.</p>

<p>The crystal goon in this set looks great, as always. The colour scheme is beautiful, but this guy is nothing special as he comes in nearly every set.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say it straight-up, this should be $15. It is just too small to warrant that extra five bucks. Still, I can&#39;t complain too much since this set is quite cheap. The play value is still pretty high seeing as kids can have fun rolling this around and playing with the dragon and spider. The display value is just fine, nothing ugly, but it&#39;s just a bike.</p>

<p><strong>Pros.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Amazing Golden Dragon Jay and Crystal Warrior</li>
	<li>Affordable&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Great for a taste of the Crystalized wave</li>
	<li>Fun and good-looking bike</li>
	<li>Strong play value with the bike, spider, and dragon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Slightly overpriced</li>
	<li>Few play&nbsp;features on the bike</li>
	<li>Oversized crystal spider</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set may not be one of the most&nbsp;significant offerings from the Crystalized wave, but it still supplies substantial play and display value and I recommend it for those who wants just a sneak peek of this season&#39;s sets. This is a great entry-level set for people trying to get into Ninjago (although this season isn&#39;t a great one to start on since it is the Endgame of Ninjago).&nbsp;</p>
