<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This set was not one I anticipated much before its release. I was highly interested in the minifigures, but I&#39;ve found that for almost all the vehicles this wave, I am less interested in the builds than I am in the minifigures. This set isn&#39;t awful, but the build and price sink this one down for me.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build experience here was almost too straightforward, I didn&#39;t find any joy in any building techniques here. The mechanism really only works well when the model is complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The car itself is far too blocky for my liking. I like the hood, but throughout the vehicle there are many unfinished spaces where studs are just left out in the open. The sides of the vehicle feel rather unfinished and look horrendous even when the mechanism is used. Around the rear section of the car, there are many blue and red technic pieces left exposed. The windscreen used for the seating area doesn&#39;t really come together for me, but I am pleased that there are two seats. I suppose Vania could use this seat, although she doesn&#39;t come in this set. I also despise how the rear wheel has gold elements while the wheels at the front don&#39;t. There is a lot of inconsistency here, and I expect better from a $45 set.</p>

<p>The mechanism itself works amazingly, I just love the smooth motion, and it looks good in both forms. When the wings are facing back, the car&nbsp;looks sleek and stylish, but when they are faced forward, they work as an attack weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The highlight here is obviously DRAGON KAI!!!! This has to be my 2nd favourite of the dragon minifigures, behind Zane. The transparent red is incredibly effective and gives him that slight darkness that he needs. The blue pins that connect the wings on the back are my only nitpick.</p>

<p>General Aspheera totally works for me. The recoloured head mould is excellent, and while I would&#39;ve preferred a snake tail, the ghost tail is adequate. The Vengestone brute also looks splendid, with those transparent pink elements really shining on this figure. The Sword of Fire included doesn&#39;t look great alone, but with the crystal attachment, it looks just fine.</p>

<p>Golden Cole is essentially just the regular Crystalized suit with golden armour&nbsp;layered on it, and I&#39;ll be the first to say that I prefer the regular suits. Still, I adore both.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>Sheesh, the prices for LEGO this year have been terrible. This should really be $30, but then again the minifigures are spectacular, so I&#39;d give this set around $35-$40. $45 is just too much. Sure, the play value is high, especially since the function is so darn good, but there is little to no display value. The car is smaller than I anticipated, so I really just can&#39;t reason with this price.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Amazing mechanism</li>
	<li>Spectacular Dragon Kai and General Aspheera</li>
	<li>Useful gold parts</li>
	<li>High play value</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Certain sections are quite ugly</li>
	<li>Bad value for $45</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is good mainly for the minifigures. I&#39;m sure Cole fans will get a kick out of this, but I would suggest you buy the much better Zane&#39;s Golden Dragon Jet (review coming soon). That set comes with an almost equally good minifigure selection and a Dragon Cole for $15 less. Sure, there are some incredible elements to this set, but it just doesn&#39;t add up.&nbsp;</p>
