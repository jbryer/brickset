<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I was incredibly excited about the Crystalized wave, and this set was no exception. 3 great minifigures and a dynamic build for only $30? Absolutely. This set did not disappoint and while it&#39;s not the most extravagant of the wave, it&#39;s one of the best standalone sets.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The build experience here was quite fun. A lot of large pieces were used, but I feel this went together well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model is quite sleek and uses its colours effectively. All the stickers here add detail where there would otherwise be none, and the shaping is adequate. My favourite details are the use of the dragon head introduced for the Core wave earlier this year. The piece looks spectacular with the transparent blue. The jet isn&#39;t the sleekest thing, but it achieves a clean and majestic look.</p>

<p>The play function is the standout here, as it works so smoothly. Unless you are extremely rough with it, I promise it will work ten&nbsp;times out of ten. I appreciate that it is actually a dramatic function and not just a small and insignificant one. This mechanism feels meaningful and the jet&#39;s shape is altered quite a lot. I think the shuriken-like look that it is going for in its transformed version is very effective, and this set should be lots of fun for kids.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the elephant in the room, DRAGON COLE!! He is one of the coolest Ninjago figures I have seen in quite some time. The transparent orange limbs give him that rocky feel, reminiscent of the RX Cole and NRG Cole. The printing is spectacular, and the wings make this minifigure look powerful and commanding. I must warn you that blue technic pins are placed on the back to attach the wings.</p>

<p>General Vangelis is also a highlight, and I appreciate the new face print underneath, even though it can&#39;t be seen with the mask on. The Crystalized Scythe of Quakes looks great even without the crystal piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Golden Armour Zane looks incredible, featuring loads of metallic printing to give him a samurai-esque design.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;d ask for $25, but this price is really the only price this wave that I could see being fair even if it wasn&#39;t for the price increases. You get some amazing exclusive minifigures, a superb build, and plenty of play value. The display value would be much better if it had a stand, but I really can&#39;t ask for more at $30.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fun and sturdy build</li>
	<li>Stand-out minifigure selection</li>
	<li>Great and affordable price</li>
	<li>Incredible play feature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Nothing notable :D</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is an all-around great deal. Its strong minifigures and vehicles make this an absolute steal for $30. I would recommend Ninjago fans to go out and buy this if you want some neat minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

"exorallan31","2022-08-28T19:52:39.63Z","I'm sorry but.. i really don't like these new Ninjago sets.","<p>So.. I&#39;m not a fan of these now Ninjago sets. I&#39;ve recently gotten interest in Legends of Chima, something I hated before... let&#39;s just get straight to the rewiew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Putting this set together was nothing special. I think it was alright. Building&nbsp;the function for the wings was decent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the parts, there is some good stuff here. The old spinner crowns, the huge blade wing things and Cole&#39;s massive wings.</p>

<p>For play, there is fun to be had with this set. especially with the wing function. Could have some creative fun there.</p>

<p>Now for the figures. Probably the most attractive thing for people in this entire wave. Love every single thing on these. Nothing to complain about here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now here is something to complain about. The jet looks kinda mediocre to me, just kinda bland. it just is not appealing to my eyes. Sorry I just can&#39;t put my finger on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I am a Lego displayer and not someone who uses my Lego all that often. The finished model doesn&#39;t look all that great to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For PPP And value overall. PPP Here, it&#39;s alright. not incredibly low, not incredibly overpriced.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>

<p>some fine parts to use for mocs</p>

<p>Great figs</p>

<p>Solid play feature</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Building experience felt kinda boring</p>

<p>Finished model feels bland and uninteresting to me</p>

<p>So overall. this is not all that great. The figures are good,&nbsp;the parts are good, the play function is good. The finished thing however, isn&#39;t appealing to me.</p>
