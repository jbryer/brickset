<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Here we go again, another Crystalized set. This is the penultimate review I suppose, though I still don&#39;t have the Ultra Dragon (nor do I have any idea when I will get it). I was quite excited at the prospect of a villain structure since those tend to be the better sets. Lately, however, Ninjago has been lacking in its temples (with one exception which I will hopefully discuss in my next review). I really wanted to adore this set, but let me explain to you what I don&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build experience was so short and very sparse. I never got into it as most of this build is just small and weak assemblies. Very few spots actually featured interesting builds and for the most part, I was breezing through the process. There are a grand total of 6 bags in this set, which I find low for an $80 set.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The Crystal King &quot;Temple&quot; is weak as an assembly. If I was to describe this set in one word, it&#39;d be rudimentary. The front section is incredibly simple, with many of the play features being extremely obvious and basic. None are particularly fun and this whole section feels loose and like it could crumble into pieces when you pick it up. If there is one thing to praise in this set, it is the colour scheme and parts. The trans-pink pieces complement the stone grey and black parts. Dark blue and purple also elevate the design even more. Still, this section feels rather simple and unfinished.</p>

<p>The larger section is significantly better, but still feels very straightforward. One of the best things here is the use of technic pieces in trans-pink. These pieces are so special and give off a mysterious and powerful vibe. The floor that holds the scythe is very bare, but the cage to the side is another amazing use of trans-pink. This is supposedly a tensegrity sculpture, which is interesting. The throne room looks alright but could&#39;ve used a little more space to pose minifigures. As it stands, the throne looks excellent, but not much else stands out. The crystals sprinkled throughout the set do add a lot of value. I also like the architecture using the large macaroni pieces and more crystals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, while this set does have an imposing presence, it feels like some sections could use some work to make this feel like a true temple and not just some floating rocks. Still, I understand what they were going for, but it doesn&#39;t really feel substantial either way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The small vengestone bird-looking thing is fine. It doesn&#39;t add much, but I guess it&#39;s cute.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Crystal King is definitely going down on the top villain minifigures of all time for Ninjago. The detail on the upper torso piece just lifts this minifigure up (literally) to a whole new level. The mask isn&#39;t perfect, but the rest of this minifigure makes up for that. He looks truly imposing and just like a final endgame-level threat for the Ninja.</p>

<p>Speaking of them, these basic Crystalized suits look stunning. They are very uniform, but the use of colours on them looks incredible. Jay and Zane are absolute standouts. Kai may be the most basic one, but these still look amazing.</p>

<p>The vengestone brute is the last figure, once again looking magnificent, although this figure is nothing special as it comes in nearly every set. I would&#39;ve appreciated more minifigures, but there are 4 exclusive variants here, so I can&#39;t knock them too much.</p>

<p>The golden weapons in this set&nbsp;look&nbsp;alright. There have been far better versions of the sword and nunchucks, but the scythe and shurikens are awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>Yikes, this is where the set really falls for me. Sure, $80 isn&#39;t a terrible price, but this is still a very unfinished set. The play value is quite bad as most of the functions feel half-baked. Alongside that, this set is also flimsy and wobbly. It doesn&#39;t get much better in the display aspect. Many sections feel incomplete, and the front section is lacking in visual strength. As I said earlier, this is very imposing though. Still, for&nbsp;<em>this,</em>&nbsp;I&#39;d rather be paying $55-60.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sweet minifigure selection</li>
	<li>Incredible crystal pieces&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Eerie and daunting display piece with great aesthetic</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Flimsy + wobbly</li>
	<li>Overpriced</li>
	<li>Unfinished and unsubstantial</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>As a reviewer, it is my job to give you my honest thoughts on this set, and honestly, I don&#39;t like it much. It&#39;ll look good enough on a shelf, but it will be no fun to play with. Of course, you all can have your opinions, but as for me, I do not recommend this set if you aren&#39;t attracted by the minifigures. If you were to buy one set from this wave, this would be a good choice, but this comes with no exclusive characters, so if you want to save some money, my advice is to pass this one up at least until it goes on sale.</p>
