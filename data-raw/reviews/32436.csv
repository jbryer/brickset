<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I HAVE RETURNED!! Sorry that&nbsp;it&#39;s been so long with no reviews! Anyway, the Crystal King was likely the set I anticipated most from this Crystalized wave. As I kept up with the show, I became even more interested in the role that this would play in it. The build looked so interesting to me, and I was also intrigued by the Vengestone army minifigures and the Harumi minifigure. Needless to say, this set did not disappoint.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build here was short and simple, none of the techniques blew me away. It took very little time, but I enjoyed it through and through.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The Crystal King himself stands quite tall, with a lot of mass in the main body of the build. I adore the transparent pink elements adorning the model, although I could&#39;ve used so many more of them, similar to the on-screen interpretation. The core of the set uses this incredible windscreen piece in transparent dark pink, and it gives an eerie look to the entire thing. The aesthetic and sculpting of this model remind me&nbsp;of the Overlord, which is who we suspect to be the Crystal King.</p>

<p>The arms have great poseability all over, and the sceptre that the King holds is effective at making him seem all the more dangerous. The legs are very limited in poseability, with the front legs only being able to move the feet and toes. The hind legs can move a lot more freely. You will have to use your imagination if you want to imagine this thing walking. The designs for the legs are not as flashy as the rest of the model, but the front legs are appropriately armoured. However, the hind legs do look a bit bare.</p>

<p>The tail is quite standard, but works for what it&#39;s going for and some stickers around the back complete the look of this from all sides. Moving to the wings, they are quite skeletal, but it works for the look this is going for, although they don&#39;t seem like they&#39;d be effective at making this beast fly.</p>

<p>The Crystal King as a whole has a wonderful and creepy look and achieves what it is going for. Some parts of it are a bit finicky, especially around the waist, but on display, it looks fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Lloyd is our only hero here, and he looks appropriately battle-damaged. He is quite standard for a Lloyd minifigure, but his design works for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harumi is the standout here, featuring a new head with pink eyes, signifying that she has been possessed by the power of the Crystal King (I assume that is what is going on, the second half of the season has not aired yet). Her hairpiece is a hard plastic this time, a change that I fully support. Her torso is shared between her and the Crystal Council, and it succeeds at making them look uniform and also very scary.</p>

<p>The Crystal King looks quite good, but I much prefer the taller version that comes in some other sets. The head mould is great, but I wish the teeth were printed in white. This is hard to look past as the face looks so flat without them.&nbsp;This minifigure still looks good and serves his purpose as the main villain of the Crystalized wave.</p>

<p>The Vengestone guards are incredible, especially for being simple henchmen. The first one has only one transparent arm, but the other one has both arms being transparent and also the crystal armour piece. These both look amazing, though I prefer the ones with more transparent elements. Their legs are all the same, and look like a fusion between vengestone and crystals, a powerful combination.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>I would normally ask this to be $60, but this is one of the better values in this Crystalized set wave. There is little play value, but that is made up for with display value. I still think some kids would have fun with this. If this came with another exclusive or hard-to-get minifig&nbsp;and a side build, that would justify the price for me, but I still don&#39;t feel that bad at paying $70</p>

<p><strong>Pros.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Wonderful transparent pink elements all over</li>
	<li>Good minifigure selection</li>
	<li>Splendid display piece</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Limited articulation</li>
	<li>A bit overpriced&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Could&#39;ve used more minifigs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This build is easily the best of the Crystalized wave, at least from what I can tell. I am in love with the aesthetic of the Crystal King, and the model as a whole is grandiose and conveys that villainous feel. This does feel like the big bad guy that we&#39;ve been waiting for, sort of like the final boss. I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better set to be the last supervillain of this era of Ninjago. I highly recommend this set if you&#39;re a fan of villain builds.</p>
