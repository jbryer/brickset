Like, what I did is I saved up my Lego VIP points and got the set for $35. It&#39;s a way better price than the $150 price tag. The menace to society inflation has got so bad, it&#39;s spreading to Lego. If you want a good dragon but still want Golden Oni Lloyd, get Lloyd&#39;s Legendary Dragon and get the minifig off of ebay/bricklink.</p>

<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>The first Ninjago set I ever got was the original Ultra Dragon from 2012, so I find it fitting that the last set I get from this Ninjago Saga is the latest Ultra Dragon. This set was obviously one of the most exciting sets of the wave for me, especially because of that Golden ONI Lloyd minifigure. So, how does it hold up now that I have it in hand? We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build experience here was very straightforward and went by quite fast. It felt satisfying to put all of these gold pieces into this, and it never got boring. My least favourite part was definitely the technic gear system for the wings, which felt a bit tedious. Still, this was an enjoyable build.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The GUD is absolutely stunning. It is massive and bulky, but it never feels too cluttered. The body feels sturdy and organic, applying a technic used on Lloyd&#39;s Legendary Dragon earlier this year. The curvature and the scales help the dragon feel natural. Once again, the gold pieces stand out and make this dragon feel truly special. The legs have pretty limited articulation, but the shaping and use of unique gold pieces make up for that. Lloyd can be mounted atop the dragon, which looks simply majestic. Notably, the dragon does not have reins, a possible reference to Season 9: Hunted. The back end of the body can be moved from side to side, and the rear legs continue the bulkiness of the dragon. The tail has limited movement, but it looks splendid, so I feel it makes up for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The heads are certainly the most significant feature, and they look quite good. I was sceptical of them when I saw them in reviews, but they feel a lot better in person. The grey joints used to connect the jaws are a bit ugly but don&#39;t bother me as much as they did in pictures. While I would&#39;ve appreciated some more elaborate builds for the heads, these all feel quite unique, and more pieces would&#39;ve been superfluous and would&#39;ve also weighed down the heads, limiting movement. Speaking of movement, these heads have a truly spectacular range of motion. You can move them any which way you like, even turning them all backwards. I admire the technique of stacking the earth and fire heads, saving room and providing for a more appealing presentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wings have proven to be one of the most controversial sections of this build, but I am indifferent to them. I have no idea&nbsp;as to how they&#39;d do cloth wings on this, and the technic system works well enough to where I can easily forgive them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a small purple throne to hold the golden weapons, which is nothing special but looks alright.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Golden Oni Lloyd is undoubtedly the standout figure of not just this set, but the entire Crystalized wave. We don&#39;t know how he&#39;ll be incorporated into the TV show yet, but I can still appreciate this figure for what he is. The gold and green details look fantastic, and the Oni mask piece fits him perfectly. I cannot wait to see how the writers handle this new concept for Lloyd.</p>

<p>The Crystal King is a figure I&#39;ve reviewed before, but I still adore the detail present all over the torso(s). The mask could&#39;ve used additional printing, but the rest of the figure just looks so darn good. This is Ninjago&#39;s &quot;Endgame&quot; villain, and he sure looks the part.</p>

<p>The Ninja are decked out in golden variations of their Crystalized outfits. Each of them have marvellous gold details packed into the torso and the legs. Kai doesn&#39;t look as good as the others, but Jay and Zane look superb.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three&nbsp;crystal soldiers are also included, with 2 of them having the dual trans-pink arms. These minifigures are glorious, but I can&#39;t praise them too much since they are in almost every set.</p>

<p>While the minifigures here are amazing, I am a bit saddened at the fact that this is a $140 (now $150) set with only one exclusive figure. Additionally, there are no female characters in this set which is a little sad for a theme that pushes equality.</p>

<p><b>Comparison to Other Dragons</b></p>

<p>I will be briefly comparing this set to the Legacy Ultra Dragon and Lloyd&#39;s Legendary Dragon, both of which I own.</p>

<p>This trumps the LUD (Legacy Ultra Dragon)&nbsp;in almost every way. GUD (Golden Ultra Dragon) is much more intimidating, taking on a more aggressive stance and actually having articulation at the legs, something LUD lacks. The heads are little more basic on GUD, but the gold plating on this entire set is more striking than LUD. The wings on the LUD are slightly better, but overall, GUD has more articulation and more options for posing than the older one, making GUD, in my opinion, a much better set.</p>

<p>LLD (Lloyd&#39;s Legendary Dragon) is essentially just a smaller version of this, featuring similar techniques for the legs and body. LLD has slightly more articulation because of its smaller size, but overall, GUD looks a lot better and feels just a little more complete than LLD.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>So, here&#39;s where it gets bad. Really bad. $150 is absolutely extortionate for what you get here. Normally, I would ask this to be $100, but I have to be fair and consider that there are a lot of supply chain issues this year, inflation has gotten worse and all of that stuff we don&#39;t like hearing. Still, $120 and maybe $130 would&#39;ve been just fine. This set does have a lot of display value and plenty of play value for kids, especially since the set is quite sturdy. Still, it&#39;s very heavy and may collapse in on itself. While there is a lot of value with everything I&#39;ve mentioned thus far and also all the new gold pieces, I still don&#39;t feel like the current retail price of $150 is at all worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A literal gold mine for gold parts</li>
	<li>Incredible display value</li>
	<li>Lots of play value&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A surprising amount of articulation for its size</li>
	<li>Exclusive ONI LLOYD!!!</li>
	<li>Large minifigure selection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Expensive and WAY overpriced</li>
	<li>Only one exclusive minifigure</li>
	<li>Heavy and collapses easily</li>
	<li>Wings and heads may be controversial to you&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Despite the dragon&#39;s shortcomings in value and stability, this has to be one of my favourite dragons in Ninjago&#39;s history. The thing is just so displayable and looks regal. The value is definitely a huge turnoff, but if it&#39;s not a problem for you, I&#39;d suggest going to pick it up. This set certainly feels like the final battle for Ninjago, and I adore the build as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, Ninjago, for all the memories you have given me. It makes me sad to know this will be the last set for the last season, but all good things must come to an end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as we know, endings are never really endings, only new beginnings.</p>

<p>An interesting set, meant to be the physical toy version of something that made no real sense in the show, but regardless, it is here. And what a thing it is to behold, and yet we bemoan it, for a good as it was, it did not reach the mark it could of.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Building Experience:</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t remember much about this part, my only true takeaways from my recollections other that it is rather interesting. Seeing how the body starts and contains all these colourful pieces, how the manage to integrate simply extra middle joint, how the colourful pieces are hidden from sight, and most interestingly, how the front scales are integrated so seamlessly and beautifully. If I were to have any complaints (besides the obvious one), it would be that the underside of the dragon, particularly in the main body and the first tail segment really needed some smoothing and rounding off, particularly the tail segment. And that a piece on the inside of each front leg is too bulky and precents movement. That part should be replaced with a flatter piece if you are able. Now, to the elephant in the room, the wings. The mechanism is not bad, in fact it&#39;s rather good and interesting. It&#39;s also interesting how the technic frame is built into the body, though it is a shame that they can&#39;t move up and down. However, the wings themselves are all but beginning for cloth wings, and given the price and the incredible wings the show version had, there is simply no excuse. No excuse for not including proper wings when they would of elevated this dragon to a another dimension entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>Nothing truly spectacular, except Oni Lloyd&#39;s mask and the dragons&#39; head (Zane one is the worst, followed by Jay, then Cole, then Kai). Oh, and the incredible abundance of very nice pearl gold parts. But in terms of actual piece mould, not colours, it&#39;s generally meh. But pearl gold!</p>

<h3>Playability:</h3>

<p>This, besides its sheer shininess, is where the dragon shines. There is a saddle where Lloyd may sit as he rides it against the Overlord (spoiler: Crystal King = Overlord), and while it looks cool, it doesn&#39;t really provide much. Now, having this set and the Crystal King enhances playability greatly, as I think it is more interesting to have the apparently most powerful dragon (do not quote me on that statement, Firstbourne may yet be superior in terms of raw might) battle&nbsp;against an interesting dark crystal centaur that is also fantastic instead a of a larger but merely okay mech, but could use some changes. Before I meander too far into Crystal King territory, let us (e.g, me) return to the Golden Ultra Dragon. The Dragon boasts excellent articulation, perhaps enough to rival Lego&#39;s other medium big dragon&nbsp;that is&nbsp;quite postable (lighter dragons like the NRG are simply&nbsp;more pose able&nbsp;due utilising the smaller Mixel ball joints, which I adore. In addition, that dragon has the best wing mechanism and no one will convince me otherwise), that being Jay&#39;s Cyber Dragon, particularly due to it also including a hip-like joint, unlike competition like Lloyd&#39;s Legendary Dragon and Zane&#39;s Ice Creature. However, there a few gripes I still have, most notable how unstable it can be, and the restrictions on the forward leg&#39;s movement due to the aforementioned&nbsp;too fat inner leg piece. The knee joints being restricted is no problem, particularly since no dragon I know of actually has working knee joints, and it&#39;s necessary for them to be static in order to bear its weight. The forward leg movement is a much more egregious offence, due to it being easily remediable. The other negative point would be that while unlikely to fall, many&nbsp;outreaching poses feel rather unstable, particularly due to the small feet and large weight. However, despite these seemingly massive problems, they are actually only fairly minor (inner leg piece is the biggest annoyance), and the rest is beautifully articulable, from the deluxe waist, to the claws, to the tail able to change rotation, to the surprising amount of movement the heads have, which by themselves are great, fearsome and able to express a lot with different poses. Of course, the guards and the Crystal King help, but especially due to the other ninjas inclusion, there isn&#39;t really going to be a big battle without the Crystal King set. Heck, even the worst part, the wings, add to the playability, as while not being the best, the wing mechanism truly is great and can aid in fearsome poses.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Value For Money:</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s just get this straight out of the way, is this large (only beaten by the Skull Sorcerer&#39;s Dragon in size, which is also awesome, but huh? Bad guy&#39;s dragon is bigger? Of course, they absolutely didn&#39;t do Firstbourne justice, as she should&#39;ve eclipsed them both, but oh well) 4 headed dragon boasting 9 minifigures (only 1 unique though, but it&#39;s one of the best, Oni Lloyd) worth 150 U.S.D, 130 British Pounds, or 150 Euros? No, and any who say yes are deluded. However, it is still a great set, and thus this brings me to my conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Verdict-</h2>

<p>Is this easily a contender for one of the best dragons Lego and Ninjago has ever produced? Yes. Does it being the four headed dragon concept to full potential? Almost. Does it look beautiful? Yes. Are the figures good, even if only 1 is truly exclusive to the most expensive set of the Crystallized season (not biggest however. That gives Nya&#39;s even more leverage as potentially the best set, but the mech [in show is awesome though] upon further inspetion and Jay&#39;s Titan Mech existing doesn&#39;t cut it for me, and it&#39;s also too expensive, even if the minifigures are the best in the wave)? Yes, but full potential is unrealised. And that statement fully sums up how I feel about this set. A awesome set, with so much potential, some much going for it, yet it falls disappointingly far from true perfection. The ungainly wings when the price more than justifies the inclusion of cloth, not like the show&#39;s version didn&#39;t awesome wings. The grey pieces were it could&#39;ve been pearl gold, particularly in the heads. The reused head moulds, leading to not all heads looking equally as good. The lack of a larger foe to face when looking at the price, one was very much justified. And thus, I rank the Golden Ultra Dragon as 3.5 stars out of 4, the best 4 headed dragon, one of the best dragons period, but with some inexcusable shortcomings, particularly in the wings and lack of large foe, given its far too expensive price. I can only recommend it only on a hefty discount or buying from somewhere else than Lego.com, where the excessive price recedes somewhat, and this incredible dragon is less tarnished by it.&nbsp;</p>

"BrickOren","2023-02-12T16:56:28.627Z","My review of the Lloyd's golden ultra dragon!","<p>Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this review, I&#39;m Oren, a TFOL and today I will be reviewing the Lloyd&#39;s golden ultra dragon! Let&#39;s get started!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opening thoughts:</p>

<p>I was super hyped when this set was announced, the price was going to be $120 but then they had their bump in price as you all know. 1 in 4 sets would cost extra. I was really hoping that it wouldn&#39;t land on this already overpriced set but it did. 989 pieces, $150. So the price is terrible on this set but now let&#39;s go into depth on everything else.</p>

<p>Building experience:</p>

<p>I give this a 4&nbsp;out of 5, I personally really enjoyed building the set, This may be because I&#39;ve never built a dragon set in my life but it was a very good build, the earth dragon&#39;s head is actually under the fire dragons but you can easily make it seem like that isn&#39;t the case and that they&#39;re side by side.&nbsp;the little throne side build is also good but lloyd can&#39;t even properly sit in it,&nbsp;the crystal king can but lloyd cannot. This is a bit of a bummer but it&#39;s not that big of a deal. The minifigures are great, I wish their were more uniques since the set costs so much but it is what it is.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Easy 5 out of 5. The parts are absolutley amazing, clever, thought out, prints, everything is absolutley great. The dragon heads are amazing looking, especially jay and zane&#39;s with the transparent blue and yellow horns. The sword for a tail, the sword&#39;s for wings, everything is great, and the Golden Oni Lloyd&#39;s minifigure parts are awesome too, the mask is really cool looking.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The playability is a 4 out of 5, it&#39;s good, it&#39;s got good posability fun minifgures and all that but the dragon may be hard to pick up for some people, I had a bit of trouble trying to hold it sometimes, my left back leg kept falling off, I don&#39;t know if this is a problem for everyone or just me but having to reattach it every 3 minutes can get frustrating.</p>

<p>Value for money:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even need to explain this monstrosity, 1 out of 5. It would be reasonable at $120 with the prints, heads and minifigures but $150? it&#39;s 989 pieces Lego chill out.</p>

<p>Overall rating:</p>

<p>4/5. I honestly can&#39;t decide between 3.5 or 4 so I&#39;m going with four. The price really drags the set, but overall forgetting about price it&#39;s an absolutley great set with good parts, playability, fun building,&nbsp;you got it all. Thanks for reading this review!</p>
