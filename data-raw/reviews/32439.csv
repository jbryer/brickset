<p><strong>Opening Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve reviewed many of the smaller sets of the wave, but it&#39;s time to talk about the big ones. This set was one I didn&#39;t expect to love from hearing about it, but seeing the images and especially the product in real life, I have been wonderfully surprised. This may be my new favourite set of the wave, so let me relay my thoughts on this set to you.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build was a nice time. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve built a set this big, so I certainly enjoyed a fresh experience. It&#39;s not too complex for the younger ones, so an older kid could definitely build this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The first thing that pops out on the mech is the startling colour scheme. The colour palette has started&nbsp;a lot of controversies, but I lean towards liking it. As a whole, the model looks incredible and is definitely inspired by some kind of anime and by action figures in general.</p>

<p>This mech feels complete from all sides and the use of pieces here is absolutely perfect. People have been keen to point out the black windscreen pieces used as knee pads. Many pieces have been recoloured in this shade of blue to make this mech look just right. I don&#39;t see any green or any other colour that would distract from the mech. I also appreciate the knee joints and wrist joints, both of which have been making themselves more present in newer mechs. Additionally, the shoulder pads can be articulated which is great (they also have cannons!)</p>

<p>The giant red X on the torso takes a while to get used to, but I appreciate the direction of making this mech stand out a bit more. With the added swords, this mech feels like a true action figure. The cockpit inside is fairly detailed and looks quite cozy. Nya is almost completely sealed up in there, which is appreciated. Overall, I&#39;m happy to say I have&nbsp;few to no complaints.</p>

<p>A small vengestone gargoyle is included in this set as well. I&#39;ll be the first to say I don&#39;t really like it. It could&#39;ve used just a few more pieces to make it looks more armored. As for now, it looks like a build from several years ago and not what I expect in 2022. Still, it&#39;s a nice addition to the crystal army.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Wowza, we have a whopping SIX exclusive minifigures (almost seven since Jay is only obtainable through a more expensive set). Additionally, they are all exclusive characters!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya looks wonderful here. I appreciate the callbacks to classic Ninjago with the colour scheme and general appearance. Jay looks very clean with the gold armour, although I do prefer the regular suit over this one.</p>

<p>Wu and Garmadon are both perfect minifigures. The way they mirror each other, one with dragon armour and one with an Oni mask, the exquisite detail on their torsos, oh my GOODNESS! I love these two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pythor is easily the best of the vengestone generals. This design fits him so well, and I admire the new prints introduced for his head and tail. The Mechanic looks alright, but I would prefer it if he had a new mould for his Nindroid eye and the updated torso print that he will have in the show. Still, he looks great, and I&#39;m not all too bothered about this.</p>

<p>Lil&#39; Nelson is included, and although I wish we had Antonia to go alongside him, he looks pretty good, and I&#39;m happy to see he&#39;s returning. A vengestone soldier is included, looking just as good as always.</p>

<p><b>Comparison to Other Mechs</b></p>

<p>I&#39;ll be using Lloyd and Zane&#39;s Titan Mechs (LTM and ZTM respectively)&nbsp;for this segment.</p>

<p>Nya&#39;s mech stands slightly taller than ZTM, but she only beats it by a little. However, there is much more bulk to Nya&#39;s mech. I much prefer the colour scheme for Nya, and as a whole Nya seems more sturdy, but I still think ZTM is a fine substitute for Nya if you want a large mech. If you have the money, Nya&#39;s mech is larger and more complete than Zane&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LTM is slightly closer to the same size as Nya&#39;s mech. I think the colour scheme for LTM works just as well as Nya&#39;s, but LTM doesn&#39;t have quite the range of articulation that Nya does. However, LTM has a large wing attachment on the back which gives it a much higher level of visual splendour. Nya&#39;s mech looks more battle ready and has more play value, but LTM looks much grander than Nya&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>Now, the Crystalized wave is famously overpriced. I&#39;d love this set to be closer to $100, but I do have to take into account the incredible minifigure selection and all the recoloured pieces. Still, I do feel this set could stand to be $10-$20 cheaper. There&#39;s a huge amount of play and display value here, but I&#39;m still leaning towards a lower price tag. Still, it is rare for a set to have so many things going for it, and I&#39;d say this set wins in almost all aspects.</p>

<p><strong>Pros.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great colour scheme</li>
	<li>Lots of good parts</li>
	<li>High display and play value&nbsp;</li>
	<li>INCREDIBLE minifigure selection</li>
	<li>One of the more reasonable prices of the wave</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pricey</li>
	<li>Lacks a bit of the visual power previous mechs have had</li>
	<li>Side build isn&#39;t incredible</li>
	<li>Colours and build are controversial, so you may not like them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I love this set wholeheartedly. This has to be the best set of the wave, especially with all the great things included. I&#39;d suggest that you go out and get this set if you can afford it since I doubt you&#39;ll regret it.&nbsp;</p>
