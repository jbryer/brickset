"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-24T00:04:08Z","Quality Fire Station","Of all the Lego Fire Stations 6389 is my favourite. The set is generally well designed. No juniourisation and a high level of innovation that I don't think many recent Lego sets have.
Cool pieces include the roller doors, chunky wheels and printed 1x3 doors on the utility, red 2x3 doors and the glass canopy on the fire engine, a whole heap of red 2x1x5 pillars and 4 old style fire men. 
The building itself is a good design with the size of the two garages matching the size of its fire engine. I didn't like how the fire men had no rest and recreation area so I added another floor onto my station.
The fire truck is a great design. It looks really sleek like the 6430 of the same era. The mechanism for folding the hose out is pretty nifty too.
The fire utility is nice eye candy but it's silly how a mini fig wearing a fire helmet wont actually fit in it. And what's with the hose on the tray? It has no water tank and no fittings to attach itself to a fire hydrant. The only good thing about the model is the doors and the wheels.
The helicopter is pretty straight forwards and obviously just tacked on to fill the set out a bit more. No major design flaws, just a little plain. 
With the firemen however you only get one actual fire helmet. The helicopter pilot has a full face helmet and two guys have hair. This is because one guy drives a desk and doesn't need a fire helmet and the second guy can't drive the utilty with a helmet on.
But overall I still like this set. Its mostly salvaged by the awesome fire engine. And compared with all other firestations it stands out because of the great brick selection and the its the only one with a 6 wheeled fire engine.  I would recomend this set to anyone is just starting and LFD or who just wants to add some great new bricks to their collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-10-28T16:27:27.31Z","Fire Tank","Pretty sure this is the best fire station yet. The building probably could've used another floor, but you can add that on yourself. After all you do get two garage doors and room to park a third vehicle. The helicopter is alright, the truck is cool, and the tank is interesting. Any other color scheme, and you could drive that bad boy into combat. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is one of my favorites because of it's rolling overhead doors.I mean,come on! not many other sets had this. overall if your town is missing this set,get one.

"T79","2014-09-01T16:10:08.433Z","Moon Base - er... I mean, Fire Control Center Review","<p>A lego city can not be complete without a fire department, luckily a new one is made available every few years. We had to wait years before we got this one, so finally we had a place all those pocket money &#39;Fire Chief&#39;s Car&#39; sets could call home. Although with some minor modifications this base and its vehicles could be made to fit your average space station just as well.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>In a strange twist of fate I can no longer find the instructions but the box is still in my possession. At the time this set was produced lego still provided alternative builds on the box, of course most of these are other fire stations or vehicles. One alternative shows a burning building where some firefighters are holding a jumping-sheet so another firefighter (no civilians in this set) can evacuate. If you had any hopes of some more down-to-earth alternative vehicles, you&#39;ll be disappointed. Some of&nbsp;the ones&nbsp;shown&nbsp;would not look out of place in an M-Tron base if you were to add some trans-neon-green!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Well, first things first: no ladder! If your firefighters need to tackle a fire in a high-rise you&#39;d need another vehicle like #6593 Blaze Battler. For a fire station this is practically unforgivable, and a small helicopter is no substitute! Luckily there are some good parts too, too many to list in fact: balloon tyres (even though you have to wonder: &quot;why?&quot;), two roller garage doors, a lot of windows, windscreens&nbsp;and canopies, some printed tiles, slopes, doors&nbsp;and panels, lots of hoses (both the flexible hoses and the strings with nozzle) and of course red bricks and plates galore. Another weird inclusion are those two big yellow fences, we didn&#39;t have any others of these, so we did not have a lot of use for them.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four firefighters in the classic black uniform with brass buttons, there isn&#39;t a civilian in this set breaking a tradition of the previous fire stations. This is not such a big deal,&nbsp;what&#39;s worse is that only two of those present come with a helmet and only one of these is a fire helmet! The others come with short black hair, one of these can be excused because he stays in the control room but the other one? &quot;I&#39;m so good I&nbsp;don&#39;t need a helmet to combat fire. Well actually <em>it doesn&#39;t fit in my car, </em>but who&#39;ll notice <em>that?</em>&quot; They do come with a nice selection of equipment: an extinguisher, an axe, a shovel, some oxygen tanks and a radio, and again lots of hoses.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A bit&nbsp;disappointing, really.&nbsp;It&#39;s not like it is boring but in the end all you&#39;re doing is building two garages, unfulfilling might be a better word. The bigger of the two garages is for the multifunctional tank (build this&nbsp;in grey or green and ride it into combat, although again with some trans-neon-green this would also fit with M-Tron): from aeroplane crashes to riot control, this vehicle will be up to the task. This is the highlight of the set, and has another hose and some equipment stored inside. Too bad the garage for it is too small, it should be at least one stud longer to make the vehicle fit. Speaking of those garages, the roller doors can&#39;t close completely because the bricks with groove are positioned over a regular plate, so they leave a slight but noticeable gap. Both other vehicles are lacking, though. The car on those cool but here superfluous balloon tires can&#39;t even fit a firefighter with helmet and has a hose but no provisions for water (a tank or fire hydrant connection), and the helicopter is just too small to be a believable firefighter (again, water storage?). The control room is pretty good however, but too small again to really have an impact on the total experience.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While it certainly looks&nbsp;good and has some neat features there are also some things which could (should) have been done better. First and foremost, a ladder: a firehouse without a ladder is like a pub without beer, as we&#39;d say here. There is room to store another vehicle like the aforementioned #6593 but this touches another point: no recreation area. There should be a room where the men can rest and relax,&nbsp;maintain their equipment etc.&nbsp;but a control room (even if it has a coffee maker) with just one chair is not enough. I&#39;d have left&nbsp;out the entire helicopter platform and either added a room there next to the control room or either in place of the control room with the control room on top of that, as it is there is no door to access the helicopter platform anyway. While stairs are normally omitted and I never missed those, at least a&nbsp;door to the platform on the roof (like in #6386 Police Command Base) would have been nice. Finally, the older #6385 Fire House-I had a tower to dry the hoses, another missing feature. There is a hose stored vertically to evoke this but that tower in #6385 sure looked better.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;d really like to score this better but in the end this is about the best I can give this set. The car and helicopter aren&#39;t very good, the building itself a bit on the boring side and the omission of&nbsp;a ladder and fire helmets is almost inexcusable. We did have&nbsp;several&nbsp;&#39;fire chiefs&#39; that could man the building (in fact, the car in this station usually was replaced by #6643 Fire Chief&#39;s Truck)&nbsp;but we never had that ladder car. I think it would have been better to include #6593 here and release the main vehicle in this set separately as that would have made more sense. Still, despite all these flaws the children are happy to have it as it is still good fun to play with (it definitely is not a bad fire station, it just is lacking in a few key areas to really stand out), and certainly better than some later stations I&#39;ve had the misfortune to lay my eyes on (#6554 and #7240, I&#39;m looking at you).&nbsp;Even those had ladders though, if your five-year-old comes up to you the moment after laying eyes on this set (well, that and shouting &quot;wow!&quot;)&nbsp;and says &quot;this station needs a ladder&quot;, you know the designers missed something important.</p>
