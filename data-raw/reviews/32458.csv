The multiple printed pieces really add to the set and there are only 9 stickers which are not very hard to apply. The chin strap and mic are moveable and can be removed easily if you do not like the look of them. The stand is much better than the Batman helmet sets being that it is just a stand and not a bunch of clear pieces. The detail on the helmet is very good, and the set uses multiple clever building techniques for the Red stripe going down the middle and the ear cushions on the interior as well as in other places on the build. This will go down as one of the best helmet sets there is, and I would highly recommend getting this over the dark trooper or Mando helmets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Absolute classic and a MUST HAVE&nbsp;that takes pride of place in my collection</p>
