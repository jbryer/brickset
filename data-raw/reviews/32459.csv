While only certain parts of the helmet are made with the shiny silver pieces it does not detract from the overall look of the set. The visor piece of the helmet should have been more narrow on the cross-section similar in size to Bobas but other than that I have no complaints, this is a very good-looking helmet set to display next to a boa helmet or Grogru or any other Mando sets or Mando themed displays.&nbsp;</p>
