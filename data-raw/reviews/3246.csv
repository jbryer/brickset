"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-28T13:50:16Z","A star set","   This set is absolutely one of the best town sets ever made, thats why its an easy legend! It has the great old lego buildings that you actually have to make with none of those big wall pieces or windows. The instructions are somewhat hard to read for the person used to the modern instructions. You can pick what side you want the buildings to be on. 

The red one is an auto-repair shop. I like that the picture above the garage is the same car as included with the set. Inside it doesnt have much except a plant and a little table with a sticker. It is unique how the cars can just pull or back into the garage. The upper floor is a restuarant with the blue printed version of the average pc computer. It is quit nice with some un-used deack space.

The blue building is a hotel. It comes with a flag and a long sticker that you have to make the base for, it reads LEGOLAND HOTEL. The bottom floor has nothing in it and neither does the top floor. It is aggravating and confusing at first but soon you will get that you have to design what goes into the floors. You can make beds, walls etc etc. It also has a unique design for a door entrance. 

The crane is pretty sturdy. It uses up alot of bricks. It runs on a keen little track and uses the high friction turret to swing around. It also uses the old, good rope system that works a of alot better than todays ones do. 

Vehicles and street. The yellow cars belongs to one of the minifigs with the black cowboy hat and blue torso, a smile face as all of them are. The car has a good little hood and is customized from the red building. The truck is good and it has a big pickup space to evidently hold trash cans or bricks of numerous kinds. 
The street is good, it is the old fashioned grey but works. It comes with an infinity amount of flowers and some good t

I recommend this for a person who has a legotown or who is intending to make one. It is a pretty hard to build and frustrating set to make, bu the end results are amazing. Get it, after all, it IS a legend!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ajsantos","2005-12-27T19:11:02Z","a must","A great set to kick off a town. Some of the largest &quot;brick by brick&quot; buildings, with nice colour schemes and architectural features. Actually, I use the red one as an hotel (has a larger lower floor), and the blue one as a town hall (has an apropriate low key office building look). Both cars are great, being quite unique in relation to other sets. The crane is perfect, being just in scale to the average Lego Town two story building. The eight mififigs are a great addition to any townscape. A very recomended buy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SgtSmash","2011-01-14T14:25:28.31Z","A set I do not own, but want! ","<p>Ah yes, Lego Main Street. The set that has eluded me for years. I had bought this set for my nephew&nbsp;when it was&nbsp;re-issued by Lego about 7 years ago, and helped him build it. At that time, I hadn&#39;t begun collecting Lego&#39;s again.&nbsp;But now I wish I had bought one for myself!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You got a ton of bricks for the $69.99 USD, and while the buildings&nbsp;may seem very small compared to today&#39;s sets,&nbsp;and accessories like lamp posts have changed over time, it was and still is one of the best sets Lego ever made. The tall cypress tree that came with this set is extremely rare, and if you can find one on Ebay, be prepared to pay upwards of $20 USD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotel building is basically just an empty shell, unless you take down the construction crane and apply the signage to the building.&nbsp;But my favorite is the&nbsp;auto dealership building. To my knowledge this is the only auto dealership Lego has made. The one yellow car is all&nbsp;that can fit in the showroom, but there&#39;s an&nbsp;office upstairs for the con artist...I mean&nbsp;cowboy with the black hat. I&nbsp;had a minifig just like him that came with the Exxon&nbsp;Gas Station and he was always the town villain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another nice feature which was standard at the time was that it came with actual road plates, in this case, two of them. If this set were offered&nbsp;today, I&#39;m sure Lego would have it be&nbsp;just the buildings and you&#39;d have to continue buying your road plates separately. I dunno, you pay so much already, those flat road plates can&#39;t possibly cost Lego much to produce. Just a way to get you to pay more, I guess.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if you have nothing but modern buildings, the Main Street set would go nicely with your town.&nbsp;If you had a concern about the&nbsp;old road plates not matching your newer plates, you can always discard these plates and put the buildings on new ones.&nbsp;Ebay does not sell this set for anything less than $150, which I&#39;m sorry but is not worth the price. I love this set, but not that much!</p>

"AETerry","2011-02-05T11:45:28.29Z","Town Classic - Main Street","<p>This is a set I managed to find and pull of e-bay at a lucky price of around $50. A bit of a minor disappointment as this turned to be another set that didn't come with original instructions and required that I down load them from another site. While the description said it was complete. I found that wasn't so when it came to building the crane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, the crane is the only part of this set I haven't been able to complete properly, nor did it have the right pieces. Still, I found I could give this set a completed look by finishing the building that the work crew is constructing and with extra pieces that I did have, make it a Legoland Hotel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main Street is one of those sets for a City/Town scene that is a must have if you can get a hold of it. You get two road plates and some smaller grey plates upon which two buildings are set on to create a down town district area. You have a street light, some signs, trees, flowers, bench and a street vendor. Some cars and 8 minifigures to populate a Lego Town with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've always imagined the red building to be a Car Sales Lot given the signs and the large open display window and the minifigure with a suit and cowboy hat standing there like that's his place of buisness and he'd like to make a deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blue building offers a wide variety of play as you can play with the Construction Workers still working on it or afterwords have it be what ever you want the building to be. Apartment complex, buisness, Hotel, the possibilities are endless with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And other figures such as the Police man, Chef and Pedestrian also add elements of play and showing a busy town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So even though my set wasn't complete and lacking parts, there is still much that can be done with it. And anyone who can get ahold of one or finds they can build it from pieces they have in a collection, this is one of those sets that's a must.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"mcjaco","2016-03-16T16:45:12.9Z","What Kind of Main Street Is This?","<p>I&#39;ve recently brought out my original collection of Legos, as my kids are getting into them. This was the forth larger&nbsp;set I received as a kid. It was great re-build that brought back many memories!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I no longer have the, but the instructions are straight and to the point. &nbsp;Two small vehicles, a car and a &quot;pickup&quot; like truck. &nbsp;Obviously the difficulty is in the construction of the crane, and needing the string to be tied off, if you&#39;re a younger builder. &nbsp;I always hated that part of the insturctions, knowing I had to get my parent&#39;s help to keep the build moving along.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too spectacular. &nbsp;The crane crank, some nifty skylight pieces for the covered entrance to the Legoland Hotel, some of my first street signs, the umbrella for the popcorn cart, the tall pine tree, and what I have found to be rarer track pieces for the traveling crane (I had eight of these pieces over three sets, and managed to lose all of them over the years!)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Eight figures, four of which are construction dudes. &nbsp;A popcorn chef? &nbsp;Well, okay then. &nbsp;Another guy with a ten gallon hat.....after building the Exxon gas station, I was beginning to wonder if Legoland was in Texas.....An overall good collection of figures to keep the playability up. &nbsp;I still love the red hard hats.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The red auto dealership (I was never sure of what it really was), was nice typical structure build, with great added 19th century stone/brick decor work. &nbsp;I love the little diamond over the door, and the added fascia bricks at the top. &nbsp;The red building consists of an odd opening in which vehicles can drive in and out of, a small table with brochures, and a second floor office, in which I&#39;d guess Ten Gallon Hat Man swindles you over that nifty yellow car&#39;s price.</p>

<p>The Legoland&nbsp;Hotel is an oddity. &nbsp;Build it per the instructions, in mid build itself, or finish it completely? &nbsp;In my case with my recent rebuild, I was missing the track parts, so I went to completion. &nbsp;It&#39;s modeled after a prefab building, whereas each part of the wall is one section that can be lowered into place. &nbsp;Once complete, it&#39;s vacant, so you better have extra bricks to trick this hotel out!</p>

<p>I still love the small popcorn stand, and the &quot;chef&quot; that stands guard over it. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This was set number three in my Legoland, and man was red, blue and white used a lot in the early days.....The red building was, and still is, my favorite of the set. &nbsp;It does remind me of many Main Street structures you see throughout the USA. &nbsp;The Hotel.....more European in design and looks. &nbsp;Both complement each other well though. &nbsp;The added &quot;park&quot; items was a nice touch.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Main Street was, and again still is, the anchor of my Legoland sets. &nbsp;It&#39;s where the hussle and bustle is. &nbsp;All current and former sets have always spread out from this set, almost like it&#39;s been the City Center for me. &nbsp;That T Intersection was a huge addition that let me spread out in multiple directions. &nbsp;</p>
