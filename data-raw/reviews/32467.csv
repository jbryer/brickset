"StarKiller22515","2022-03-16T17:38:34.02Z","A Great Tribute","<p>The build is pretty great for a display set and includes 3 Monkeys which is amazing and a terrific looking Jane Goodall figure along with an exclusive printed tile. Jane Goodall is an accomplished zoologist in the field and is certainly one of the best. It is so great to see the LEGO group honour her with such a great set. I would highly recommend picking this set up if you missed out on the promotion because it is a great LEGO set to own.&nbsp;</p>

Trees are fine (a lot of leaves for a Lego set), other flora accents are nice, and this tiny river gives more depth&nbsp;to the diorama. I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.</p>

<p>Parts: There are no&nbsp;desirable/unique parts (except minifigure). Great range of greenery. Colors accents are set perfectly in that scale. We get 3 chimpanzees, which is awesome. Ms. Goodall&#39;s minifigure looks good enough, but printed legs will be nice to have.</p>

<p>Playability: Even if it&#39;s definitely a shelf-set, it can be played with, especially after combining it with Lego City&#39;s set focused on Africa&#39;s animals, like&nbsp;60302 or&nbsp;60307.</p>

<p>Value for money: As a&nbsp;gift, it doesn&#39;t have a retail price. Taking into account second-hand prices, it&#39;s relatively cheap. For 20 euros/dollars, we get a nice set for display.</p>
