Put it either next to your harbour, in the vicinity of your airport or somewhere around the shunting area of your train, it works beautiful everywhere.
And even in its own right, it can function as a centerpiece of your industrial-zone in order to give all your trucks a proper destination (for once) whilst they are cruising through your town.
Also, brickwise, this set has got it all. sliding doors, a garage-door, loadlifter, a fair quantity of doors, windows, fences and sloped bricks. And there's really a wealth of single- and threestud plates and bricks to be found in this set.

In my opinion this set, in terms of aesthetics and functionality, reigns supreme over any fire- or police-department set out there",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
