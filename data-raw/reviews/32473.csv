"StarKiller22515","2022-12-29T04:52:13.92Z","A return to the great Lego Star Wars may 4th Promos","<p>The build in this set is great and comes with the first ever Aunt Beru minifigure. While she does nit have printing on the dress her torso and head are very good depictions of the character. This is a must have set if you have the Owen Lars minifigure&nbsp;already and will make for a great display set. It is great to finally see Lego Star Wars get a good May 4th promotion after several years of poor promos.</p>
