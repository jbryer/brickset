This foil pack provides a nice alternative to the set. The minifig has some incredibly detailed printing and the weapon is alright.&nbsp;Nothing crazy parts wise&nbsp;(besides the fig),&nbsp;it&#39;s a magazine promotion so that&#39;s&nbsp;to be expected, but if you want Bentho but don&#39;t want to buy the set he comes in, I&nbsp;recommend getting this set.</p>
