"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-12T19:32:56Z","Let the good times roll...","A set which defined the Town theme in the mid eighties.  It was the largest set in terms of roadplates released to date with much of it's appeal coming from the vast number of new pieces, most of which were used in the construction of the plane and helicopter.  The Airport terminal had plenty of nice touches including a second floor cafe, while the airplane had storage space for 3 of the newly designed suitcases.  Along with a smart looking pilot with gold trimmings, a baggage van and a helicopter that was far more realistic than it's predecessors it was a set worth every penny.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"piratetown","2007-08-01T16:15:06.473Z","Best airport plane","For me, this airport is all about the security x-ray, the clock the jumbo jet, and the runways. I don't think any other airport until the latest one ever had an airplane as good as this one. Loads of useful pieces: a copper, runways that one can use as roads, glass windows and doors. My first big set, and I loved it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrdoofa","2008-03-08T19:08:25.09Z","The best airport by FAR!","I got this airport for christmas when I was a kid, that was a truly great christmas as I got most of my lego town that year! I love the design of this set, the luggage cart is small but fantastic, I also think that it has the best helicopter of any airport set and the plane was ground breaking stuff using many new parts and could seat 4 passengers and a pilot as well as hold 3 suitcases. My favourite part however is the terminal building with the luggage inspection area, passenger waiting room, first floor cafe and nicely topped off with the air traffic control room. The set includes 4 full size baseplates and 1 smaller one for the building. I found that 6368 and 6697 compliment this set perfectly. If you see this set BUY IT, you will not regret it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2007-10-26T23:23:07.733Z","Thanks to Mom and Dad for Giving Me Awesome Sets Like this for Christmas","Besides G.I. Joe and Transformers, the toys I remember playing with most as a kid in the 80's were my LEGO bricks. It was sets like this airport that were responsible for my childhood love of LEGO. Of course, my parents are responsible for buying me these sets when I asked for them for Christmas. 

This set rocks. The plane was beautiful. The helicopter was great looking as well. Both the plane and helicopter could have been sold on their own! The tiny luggage car is cute yet too simple but it does the trick. The minifigs are some of the best available in any town set from the 80's (pilot, airport workers, copper, female traveler and business man). I just learned tonight by reading another member's post that the briefcases were originally produced for this set. The luggage inspection area of the airport building was so memorable, that when I built this set last year for the first time since the 80's that I remembered it like it was yesterday. The color selection was nice as well because I had a white police HQ, a red fire fighter house and this set was distinct from those in this regard. The baseplates are plentiful as are the small round 1 x 1 plates. I loved the translucent round plates as a kid because they could always add a cool touch to any of my space creations. The building and luggage car seem tiny when compared to the latest airport model but I'll take this classic 80's version over the newer model anytime.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cornwell","2008-05-03T19:24:16.577Z","Amazing kit","I got this kit for Christmas one year and I seriously think my parents regretted that decision in the following weeks. All available bits and pieces was used to build houses, cars and airplanes, there street-plates sported a full city with houses, post offices, police stations, firehouse, signs, trees, the full monty. And I guess that the house was filled with the noise of a kid simulating planes taking of or helicopters for the next couple of days. Then friends came to visit to see the awesomeness of the Christmas gift, and the house filled with the sounds of multiple cars heading for the airport, the living room and kitchen airspace was repeatedly violated by helicopters and aircraft of all sorts, and at one memorable event a multitude of sirens as the fire brigade had to report to a fire at the airport. 

With one aircraft, a helicopter, a small truck for transporting luggage, a conveyor belt for the luggage, a second floor caf&#233;, a control-tower and a multitude of minifigs, this kit provided hours upon hours of playtime. Probably one of the greatest kits ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-08-24T17:30:45.827Z","Only 7 reviews?","I can believe that this set has only 7 reviews and that somebody give it a 4!
For me is one of the best set.
I remember living in Minnesota (USA) for a year in 1986 and I got this set for my Birthday, I was 8 years old, today I am 30 and I still have every brick of it.
It was the first Lego Airport and the best, the yellow colour is good, the 3 floor building with a control tower in the top, a restaurant in the second floor and a waiting area in the ground floor with a nice baggage reclaim system it is great!
It has one of the best helicopters and a very good passengers plane (today's planes are too big for Lego cities).
It has a cool red car for the luggage and the best thing 4 Base plates and 8 minifigures.
I also have the 6368 Jet Airliner and 6687 Turbo Prop 1 that are perfect for this set, additionally this year I bought the 7732 mail plane that it is in the same scale that the 80ts planes, so a new addition to my airport.
In conclusion 5 out of 5 and please this set should be higher in the top rated set, more reviews!

"iamburning","2009-12-30T10:53:48.42Z","My Favorite set of all time","I got this set for Christmas - I was 6 or 7 at the time.  I remember just being awed by how much was going on and how much fun me and my brothers had putting all the minifigs to work.  The terminal seems quaint by today's standards but was pretty typical of one at a medium sized airport at the time.  I rebuilt this set a couple of years ago (minus the helicopter) and it is still every bit as cool as it used to be.  

It's too bad the new airport sets don't include runway baseplates as it really detracts from the playability and overall feeling of being an actual airport. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"heero","2010-07-22T06:39:13.447Z","Prefect? or Almost Perfect?!","I think I got this set when I was 9 or 10, and I'm still having it after 20+ years (with some shelf wear on the box). To me, it looks just like the real thing, there are control tower, restaurant, waiting area, clock, baggage slide, baggage truck, airport staff, passengers, bags, runway with lights on the ground, etc. Back in the old days, I love to play around with the baggage slide and baggage truck so much, as if I'm working at airport. And the base plate are fun too, I'll change the runway once in a while especially when I have a new building in my town. Without the runway, the airport is just incomplete! The plane might not look as good comparing to the latest ones but the size is just right! I've recently bought a few more base plates to accomodate a few more planes (e.g. 7732) to make it looks more busy. More importantly, with the addition of 6399, my town is perfectly completed~! (Other airport set doesn't match with 6399 as good)<br><br>If I must have to complain, it's missing a staircase for boarding onto the plane that the other airport sets have~<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"HWR1996","2011-04-24T06:20:59.483Z","One of the best airports!","<p>This is my first review so forgive me if it isnt perfect!</p>
<p>I brought this for Â£29 two years ago.</p>
<p>This set consists of a runway, aeroplane, helicopter, and of course the airport. </p>
<p>The Minifigures:</p>
<p>The pilot</p>
<p>Two men&nbsp;with an aeroplane on his top</p>
<p>A lady wearing the same top as above</p>
<p>A policemen (seeming as this was made over 25 years ago not much has changed!)</p>
<p>Two tourists/passengers</p>
<p>And the helicopter pilot</p>
<p>Minifigures: 9/10</p>
<p>Could have had less people with aeroplane tops, yet they're problably the staff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Runway: this consists of three baseplate</p>
<p>Not much else other than lights!</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p>Could have been longer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aeroplane: </p>
<p>The top can be opened and has about eight seats</p>
<p>Their is also a compartment to place suitcases. </p>
<p>Along with this is a small vehicle which carries the suitcases.</p>
<p>9/10</p>
<p>Is a bit small, but isnt ridicolously large like the most recent aeroplane</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<p>The airport</p>
<p>There is an entrance which&nbsp;has a door. To the left of this is the baggage area, and to the right is where i presume you order&nbsp;your flights.</p>
<p>And at the next&nbsp;floor is a meeting room, and above that the control tower</p>
<p>10/10 perfectly spendid for any town</p>
<p>Overall: 95/100</p>
<p>If you overlook some small tweaks, the set is one of the best</p>

"MilkyBarKid","2010-11-03T13:13:13.463Z","It is now a bank...","<p>I originally got this set as a Christmas gift when I was 7 and I never stopped playing with it.&nbsp; At the time I was obsessed with planes so much of my focus was loading my mini-figures onto the plane and ""flying"" it round my bedroom!&nbsp; My review is now based on looking at it now as opposed to when I was 7...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Plane</h4>
<p>Compared to the passenger planes of recent sets this plane is rather ""boxy"" and small as the inside is a little cramped.&nbsp; Despite this, the plane is still a vital part of my airport acting as a short haul passenger plane.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Helicopter</h4>
<p>Again, compared to the recent helicopter in the 3222 VIP Helicopter and Limousine Set, this is rather small and ""boxy"".&nbsp; I think this is the one part of the set that is due for retirement...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Terminal</h4>
<p>This is still a great building with lots of playability.&nbsp; Admittedly, it looks quite garish and dated compared to the newer airport terminal.&nbsp; Still to this day my favourite parts of this building are the sloped windows from the control tower and the baggage claim.&nbsp; With the 3182 airport looking more modern and more like Heathrow terminal 5, my original terminal now serves as a Bank on my main street - the ground floor now serves as the main area of the bank with the baggage claim part now an ATM in the wall.&nbsp; The sloping windows of the control tower are now moved down to the roof next to what was the restuarant area on the second floor to make a fancy office for the bank manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, this is a fantastic set both as an airport and using the building as something else in your town.&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"cavilaarquin","2019-01-23T17:34:21.04Z","THE AIRPORT!!!!","<p>I am an AFOL from Costa Rica. I was a child in the 80s and thanks to my mom I have been in contact with Lego since I was very child, I think I got my first set on 1982.</p>

<p>So I have a lot of memories of those vintage sets. I remember to see this beautiful Airport, with its clock, the Tower and all those details... I always wanted. Sadly is very difficult for a LEGO lover to have all the sets that we want to have!!!! Even if LEGO has produced another Airports, some of them pretty amazing, for me this one will be always&nbsp;THE AIRPORT.</p>

<p>I couldn&acute;t have it until now that I have had lucky enough to got one on eBay. I am in love with my vintage Airport, I play with the Airplane, the terminal and I feel myself like the child I was in 1985 no the AFOL of almost 40 years old that I am now. If a set has that capacity, has served well its purpose. I simply love it, is very fun, beautiful, well made, is a classic, and I am very happy to finally have it in my collection</p>
