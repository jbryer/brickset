<p>For the price of 5.99&euro;, you get a surprising big figure.&nbsp;Remember that it&#39;s the same price as for a little minifigure keychain!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t buy it because I liked the TV series in my childhood, but I thought it&nbsp;would look quite funny. That&#39;s the reason why I even considered buying the entire Ideas set. My wallet is now happy about the release of this keychain... :-)</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t worth to describe it in each detail: You get exactly what you see at the images of LEGO, and in my opinion, it was a good decision to take&nbsp;it home from the LEGO-Store.</p>

<p>And that brings me to my last point: In Germany, you pay as far I know only 4.99&euro; in the stores but&nbsp;5.99&euro; in the online shop, so you can save one Euro if you buy it there! However, I just visited the shops in Nuremberg and Munich, I don&#39;t know about the situation in other parts of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and&nbsp;the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my short review, leave me a &#39;&#39;helpful&#39;&#39;&nbsp;Assessment there if you want&nbsp;and have a nice day!</p>
