I did not have it as a kid, and parted it together from bricklink, so I can only talk from that experience.  The set in my opinion is centered around the vehicles.  The semi tow truck is huge, and has some nice features.  The semi tractor-trailer is great, no special parts, but has a lot of detail.  Another trailer or something would have been nice for the black rig.  The buildings are functional, a store and a rest area for weary over the road lego drivers.  This set is very nice and I am very happy to own one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is a great set, it is very big and has 3 good trucks, the best one is the red one with a clever device in the back to carry the other trucks.
It also has an small office and a restaurant that it could be bigger but the design is nice.
This set was always the centre of my Lego towns.

You get 3 trucks in this set which are all very cool. There is enough gas to go around in this set and is a perfect set to have in your town. It is one of the best town sets ever made.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I'm really happy to say that I was able to procure this set off of ebay a while back for a (ridiculous) sum.  But it's definitely a collector's dream to own a set like this.

On the one hand, one great feature is the number of trucks that this set provides.  A whopping three big rigs just as the name implies!  But what I like about this set is that it answers the question: where do truck drivers go?  Lego has thereafter produced numerous big rig type of sets, but there's never been a real dedicated set since this set that adds something just for this theme.

This set provides a little repair shop for the truck drivers, an office and some gas pumps just for the big rigs.  What's even better is that this set can fold, so you can put other base plates in between or have both buildings back-to-back to each other.

I think Lego has downplayed the &quot;workers&quot; aspect of the town series too often, preferring fire, police, gas or airlines over more daily job type of instances.  Of course, now they're coming out with construction focused vehicles, but it's the building systems that is sorely missed.  Again, they just don't make sets like this anymore.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cbowers","2011-09-21T00:01:13.643Z","Endless possibilities of this set are the life to Town","I can say a number of things about this set. I will say that of the earlier lego sets that I have, this set's trucks have survived probably the longest through the years of multiple rebuilds. They may have been deconstructed once, but they are now assembled, and they bring back those memories that the set originally created upon its arrival in my den.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The experience of the set is really capitalized by the vehicles in the set, and the versatility of the trucks in the set. The trailer can be switched to either cab, and the tow ruck can tow both trucks accordingly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As if the trucks weren't enough, the set includes a dining area, which I always like to think of as a late night spot much like a breakfast restaurant. Also, an office area is included, with endless possibilities for its actual use.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I always envision this set as a late night destination along the lone road between two lego towns that gets the truckers to the next destination. It can be placed on the outskirts of a town to give a sense of realism to a layout.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As for the build: It is rather simple, yet complex. The pieces are to my liking, where they are still all of the small pieces that make up the larger pieces unlike today's trucks of six studs. The trucks of six studs may be fun, but these are just as fun, especially in construction. The hardest part of the set for me as a kid was the construction of the wrecker, mainly because there are two pulleys, one for each hook. This is also tougher to operate the older you get. I like the design of the trucks, definitely reminds me of the 80s early 90s open road.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The building construction is also simple, but again contains many pieces and is fun to build. This was before the era of lazy 1x1x5 studs. The individual bricks give an authenticity to the structures' aesthetics as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I hope anyone that purchases this set will be just as pleased as I am, and was.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
