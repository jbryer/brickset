Why don't Lego still make sets like this?

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-22T22:40:16Z","I love it! ","My favourite LEGO set of all time. It is very hard to top this one. The parking garage, the cool gas station, the car wash! How can you hate it? It has all those nice little touches, such as the shop, the repair area, and the brush to wash your cars windshield. Neat figures, a red motorbike, a cute pick-up, and a trio of cute cars (all similar), not to mention a three-story parking garage make this my all-time favourite!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T00:14:33Z","My favorite set!","This is one of the best sets that I own and has one of the highest playability values of all my sets! It has the parking tower, car wash, a working lift, the Shell petrol station with the pumps and all the details, and even has a vacuum to clean your LEGO vehicles after the car wash! It also includes 3 cars, 1 Shell truck, and a motorcycle. To top it off, there are 6 minifigs! 

A nice detail is that the set is hinged so there are two ways this set can be positioned; the parking tower and station can be side-by-side (like the photo) or it can be swiveled so they are behind each other.

Highly playable and a must for any LEGO town!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-13T17:52:36Z","Metro Garage n Gas","I still have the set together all these years! That reminds me I have to dust it. I got it for the sheer complexity of it all and because I liked the Shell station released in '86 or '87.  I believe this set was released in 1989. The car wash and the garage side of it is excellent. I love how the set hinges and can fold so the garage and gas station are back to back. I just wished I had two full sized pumps. I was not sure as well what that machine or pump was on the other end of the Shell canopy. I wish the shop was bigger and the Shell pickup was really a tow truck. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Many cars, minifigs, special wall bricks, and of course all the detailed stuff.. very nice. I already love it because it will go well with the other sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-11-03T23:55:25.623Z","Every city needs at least one","Personally I doubt I'd ever want a Lego gas station, and really a parking garage doesn't sound like it would be that interesting. Here, though, you get a lot in one package. The gas station helps to fill out the set, helping to inspire your own town's layout. There is nothing special about the cars, but again it helps to create an actual town. The elevator and car wash are a neat touch.
Very down-to-earth set with good bits of detail all around.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-07-26T15:02:11.11Z","Future Classic","This is such a cool set that it should be re-released. The parking tower is very cool and useful in any Lego town. The elevator is also a nice addition to this set and great for any vehicle. The gas station is a good place to be by a parking tower. There are a lot of vehicles and minifigs which is even cooler. This is a classic set that needs to be re-released.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:26:09.513Z","Wish I Had More of These","Another set I bought on ebay for a ridiculous sum.  But it's one of those sets that you feel glad to own.  And if you didn't have the chance, shame on you!

This set has a regular gas station that has been sold left and right over the years.  But the killer part is the parking garage itself.  It's not difficult to make own your (minus the little lift piece), but to see Lego sell something like this makes it a must have set.  When you think of a Lego garage, either a small space in a drive way, the pull down garage parts from the 80's (which have been making a comeback lately), or the old fashioned gates come to mind.  But the parking structure is very modern and can easily be used for numerous situations.  Got an office?  What about a shopping center?  

Three normal cars, a shell truck and a motorcycle get you started with this garage.  But for your cars that are sitting around along the street plates, you now have a place to park them!

Also, the other little element is the car wash.  Of course, some of the later gas stations started including them, but it was nice to see Lego starting a new trend from this set.  Too bad they didn't continue creating more parking structures with innovative ways to get your car up and down from the differing levels.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"damonae","2011-11-21T10:40:41.94Z","Very playable, many details, good build concepts","This set has the classic look of Lego town from the 80's, but with some newer, better parts and build techniques from the 90's. There are just enough elements of a gas station/carwash/shop/carpark to give the feel of all those things without getting bogged down in details and complicated construction. The cars are simple, but having four vehicles is better than if they had included three. I agree with another post that the Shell truck could have been a tow truck. The car wash is very well done with the hoses also acting as springs to push the brushesback into positionafter a car has gone through.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5
"FP_X","2012-03-27T16:48:44.307Z","I played a lot with this set","Aside from the Shell brain wash I love everything about this set. The elevator was nice, the car wash was great and the size of the model was fun to play with (and build obviously).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>After all those years, it's in many pieces in one of my Lego boxes. The red roof is still&nbsp;assembled. When my nephews plays, I see the different parts of this gas station and it bring back lots of memories.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"SKTobias","2017-04-18T13:39:43.84Z","Lovely station","<p>May be it is my long experience with this set that makes it so unique for me. I am now in my&nbsp;30s, so when I first got this set I was around 6-7. I loved it and I still like it, although it looks a bit outdated in terms of design. The car park is rather simple, but the colors of the station with the brand logos of Shell are awesome. The station looks like a (classical) petrol station. The car wash is working fine and all those little signs indicating a service station are just lovely.<br />
The colors of Shell are also reflected in&nbsp;the car park with those small yellow bricks and red plates as the foundation stones.<br />
There is also a little car lift next to the car wash. It has a great playability with 4 cars that are included. It will always be one of my favorite sets.</p>
