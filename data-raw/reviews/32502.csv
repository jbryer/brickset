<p>This LEGO Jurassic Park set is a set aimed for AFOL and can be used as display or vignette. This set depicts iconic scene from the first Jurassic Park set where the T. rex attacked the car with Lex and Tim Murphy inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648990096392-VK85P5LB1WYTMA9U1CHB/LEGO+76956+-+Front+view.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Alan Grant and&nbsp;Ian Malcolm tried to save the children by distracting the dinosaurs with flare. The T. rex chased Ian and Alan managed to rescue the children from the damaged Ford Explorer.</p>

<p>This set come with 4 minifigures which are Alan Grant, Ian Malcolm, Lex Murphy and Tim Murphy. Three out of the four minifigures have dual expressions. The only minifigure without dual expression is Alan Grant. Ian Malcolm has shocked and confused expressions which looks nearly similar while Tim and Lex both has worried and elated expressions.</p>

<p>Tim and Lex use special torsos for this set. Their torsos are muddy clothes pattern on the front and back sides. Ian and Alan torsos&nbsp;have water pattern at their back. Apology, I forgot to take photo of the back side.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648990544163-234OKREGAMP7YYZ4RC7F/Minifig+with+acc.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Alan and Ian both have flares. Alan has two head accessory options which are the hat and hair. Tim has alternate head accessory which is a night vision helmet.</p>

<p>On this set, there are 4 main components. The damaged or shall we say the destroyed car, the intact Ford Explorer, the T. rex and the background that also functions as the base for the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/d806a0c1-93c2-4676-a227-77e0d6c6765c/mobil+jurassic+terbalik-injek.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Let us look at the damaged car. This Ford Explorer was turned over by the T. rex and stepped on, thus, destroying the glass canopy. The top part of the car become level with the ground. There are studs that can be used to attach the T. rex foot unto them.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648991740190-N2H9R8HS2WN5DGO9OQ4L/Mobil+Jurassic+Park+Hancur.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>This turned over car has Jurassic Park label on both sides. It also has number 04 as its identification number. Unfortunately, the 04 Ford Explorer car was attacked by the T.rex. When the car is turned to its side, we can see a simple build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648991740228-T7RKRCTBW5GCNCIR0Z3B/Mobil+Jurassic+Park+Hancur-2.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>When the 4 x 8 DBG plate is removed, we can view the hollow build inside. There are not many parts required since nobody can view it inside and this method saved us a number of LEGO components</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648992279159-SAMO5MV7GMLPALN8QY78/LEGO+Jurassic+Park+Ford+Explorer.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The Ford Explorer numbered as 05 fare better than its counterpart. Due to that, we can see the design of this car. It looks quite accurate with the actual car showed on the film even though this car is only minifigure scale. Though the top glass canopy is too big because it used canopy generally used for Speed Champion cars.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648992279891-KULOST9M3AQ8PVGB3AVJ/LEGO+Jurassic+Park+Ford+Explorer-2.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>This car will have Easter eggs related to the first Jurassic Park film. Let me show you the photo below and tell me how many Easter eggs you can find from it. I will remove the glass canopy for easy&nbsp;viewing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648992991354-M0VRV9EWIFS7NM9KFGHP/LEGO+Jurassic+Park+Ford+Explorer-easter+egg-2.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>On top of the dashboard, we can find parts that resembles two glasses of water which from the film those glassed were vibrated by the steps of the T. rex. The second Easter egg is the screen that displayed the Isle of Nubar.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648992991334-L6AFKFO2AU82CUETHOWM/LEGO+Jurassic+Park+Ford+Explorer-easter+egg.jpg?format=500w"" /></p>

<p>The third Easter egg is in plain sight. Can you see it? It is the high-powered torch used by the children which attracted the T. rex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of T. rex, let us now view what the brick-build T. rex looks like.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648993327337-KVVBHGQZ29SEMDG71CSH/LEGO+t-rex.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The designers seem successful in getting this the T. rex right. Even though the T. rex is made from bricks, it clearly looks fierce enough. The designers also did not forget to use fuchsia as the colour for the tongue. I really like the pose of the T. rex from the photo above.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648993327336-P7FW09JND6C83DE9E6CI/LEGO+t-rex+2.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The T. rex has joints that allowed some parts of the body to be articulated, despite limited movements. From the photo above we can see a different pose for the T. rex. It looks like the T. rex is sniffing smell from the air or raise his head to listen for the movement of its prey.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648993805829-2R8RX14JRTL5ESDEQKCF/LEGO+76956+background.jpg?format=500w"" /></p>

<p>The photo above showed the background. It has so many Easter eggs on it which I will not list them here. It will be fun for you when you build this set yourself and find the Easter eggs by your own.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648993805583-LLUSBDG1VVGT6I2LRPZX/LEGO+76956+background-2.jpg?format=500w"" /></p>

<p>The back side of this base is used to attach the vegetation to be similar with the film. Though I would say the vegetation such as the trees, ferns and leaves are not dense enough to match what we see in the film. Can you clearly see one Easter egg on this photo?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/7611e25c-2cd8-44c3-b516-db8aa37b1649/Jurassic+Park+76956.jpg?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Last but not the least, like LEGO Ideas or sets specifically for AFOL, the assembly instruction book is specially designed which can be seen from the photo above. It looks neat with so many leaves and ferns covering the entire book cover with a large Jurassic Park logo in front.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1648994242859-3L42TS49MWD4GBS05N5N/Jurassic+Park+76956-2.jpg?format=500w"" /></p>

<p>On the first several pages, we can read the experience and story of the designers when they designed this set. As not to spoil too much, I will only show one page of the designer story.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is really a fun experience to me! I watched the film which I think is from 29 years ago. I can still remember clearly the scene depicted by this set. Unfortunately, there is no goat that can make this set complete!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A lot of parts that make this set quite sizeable. Unfortunately, no goat is available for this set and many similar parts which are used for the base of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This set is not only for display. You or your children can play with this set. When I first finished this set, my son play with it straight away.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much since I get this set for free. But judging from the price shown on LEGO US website, I can say this price is quite competitive&nbsp;for a licensed set.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.indobrickville.com/review-lego-jurassic-park-76956-t-rex-breakout"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
