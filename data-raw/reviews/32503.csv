"AlkkuV","2023-01-05T13:46:06.603Z","I love this","<p>So this was the second set that I got for Christmas and I love this one even more than my other set 75333 (reviewed that one as well) this is fantastic in every single sector.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: The box is what you expect a normal box to be like so let&#39;s just skip it. The instructions were normal, but I can&#39;t understand that&nbsp;these instructions that are much bigger have 99 pages and in my 75333 review the much smaller instructions had 103 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: I just loved to build this I cannot say anything else. I see no flaws in this. The motors were just a bit annoying to build, and I wish that Peli Motto would have got like a tool rack or something instead of her just carrying a wrench. Also, I loved the little pod that Grogu has. Also, the central engine or whatever it was a bit clunky, but there was a space behind it where you could put Mando&acute;s jetpack and the darksaber</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures: Again it seems that I just get/buy sets with good minifigs. The set has 4 minifigs, and 3 of them are unique. The only one that is not unique is Grogu. The unique ones are: a different version of Mando, Peli Motto and BD-72.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: There were nine unique parts in the set. There were not really any special parts because the ship is 90% light grey, but it had&nbsp;a bunch of different coloured parts on the inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall review: Overall I loved this set. Once I started building it I knew that this was my favourite set of the year. The minfigures were great and&nbsp;there were&nbsp;some&nbsp;good&nbsp;parts, but the only downside is the playability, because there were no bad guys. Overall i would give this set a 4,5/5</p>

"henrymorris476","2023-04-22T19:43:30.137Z","Wizard","<p>The Naboo Starfighter from 2007 was my first ever Lego Star Wars set and therefore one of my nostalgic favourites, so it feels right to finally be revisiting it in a souped-up&nbsp;form based on its appearance in The Book of Boba Fett and the Mandalorian.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build and Parts</strong></p>

<p>The build is surprisingly large and solid compared to what I expected based on promotional images, feeling sufficiently swooshable without the worry of any pieces breaking off. Even so, it manages to retain the sleek, streamlined appearance of the classic Prequel era starship with excellent accuracy. The updated colour scheme isn&#39;t quite as eye-catching in Lego form as the chrome plated ship in the show, but does its best within the limitations of standard brick colours. Both the Mandalorian and Grogu can be seated in the two cockpits provided, with space to store the Darksaber and Din&#39;s jetpack hidden within the fuselage. Play feature-wise it is surprisingly lacking however, with two spring-loaded shooters on the underside being the only ones present. Some interesting pieces and building techniques are used to create the elegant&nbsp;curvy design, as well as the stripped-back engine housing, and on the whole this&nbsp;creates a very pleasing looking ship.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly for a Star Wars set, the minifigures in 75325 are not actually the stand-out attraction. They are, however, a solid line-up of characters. Most exciting to most people will likely be Peli Motto, who appears as a regular side character in both the Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. Her minifigure is accurately detailed, and I particularly like the addition of the tool-belt accessory. She comes equipped with a spanner, which seems appropriate for demonstrating her engineering prowess. Peli comes accompanied by a BD droid (BD-72), which for anyone who has played the Fallen Order video game will be a familiar design. It comes as a single moulded piece with a stud connection, and has just enough printing to capture all the necessary details at this scale. Another stand-out minifgure appears in the form of the Mandalorian Din Djarin, who features the now standard but still incredibly detailed Beskar armour printing. The only unique part to Din, which has admittedly&nbsp;been a long time coming, is a printed head piece under his helmet rather than just a plain black one that appears in most other sets. Din comes equipped with the Darksaber, portrayed as a standard Lego lightsaber, but with a solid black blade, and his trusty jetpack. Finally, the Mandalorian is accompanied by everyone&#39;s favourite green baby, Grogu. This is the same version that has appeared in every set that he features in, and utilises the Lego baby body with a specially moulded rubber head.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a fantastic rendition of Din Djarin&#39;s turbo-boosted N-1 starfighter, and fans of Star Wars spaceships will find a lot to love here in its sleek and accurate design. However, this is offset by a somewhat unexciting selection of minifigures which feels limited for the price point. On top of this, the price seems quite high considering the number of pieces&nbsp;included, despite the ship itself ending up as a considerably larger model than expected. With this in mind&nbsp;I recommend picking it up on a discount if possible, but, if not, 75325&nbsp;is still a solid set to add to anyone&#39;s Lego collection.</p>
