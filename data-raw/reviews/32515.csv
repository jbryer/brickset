This set is an exceptional deal that gives you five minifigures and a little stud launcher. Do the match: five mini figures for $15 is like going back to the Collectible Minifigures <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Collectable-Minifigures/subtheme-Series-5"">Series Five</a> in 2011!</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The bulk of these mini figures are from the movie Thor: Ragnarok although Thor&lsquo;s hair should be short and the Chitauri is from different MCU movies all together. Thor&#39;s armor looks great with the electric details. The Valkyrie mini figure is right from the scenes of the planet </span></span>Sakaar<span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""> from Thor Ragnarok and looks great. Korg&#39;s minifigure and head piece looks fantastic and is exclusive to the set. Miek is also exclusive to the set although his minifigure could easily be built with scrap pieces you have and a blue head. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Although the Thor and Valkyrie minifigures have been in other sets, those have all been expensive sets, adding to the value of this set. The Chitauri minifigure has really good details and even though he&rsquo;s from a different movie, you&rsquo;re not going to throw them away. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">There&#39;s a running joke in Thor: Ragnarok that Thor thinks he&#39;s the strongest Avenger while Hulk and Tony Stark agree that Hulk is the strongest. This set may not be the strongest Marvel Comics set, but it&#39;s an excellent choice. This set doesn&rsquo;t stay in stock online or in Lego stores, so if you see it I highly suggest that you get it.</span></span></p>
