"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-19T03:26:28Z","A fun little playset","Excellent set! And man is it big! The runway is 3 baseplates plus there is another baseplate for the taxiing area. I love the little security gate and the luggage slide. There's also a helicopter, baggage truck, and a jet plane that can seat 3 minifigs. The jet even has a small baggage compartment. This set comes with 8, count them, 8 minifigs!

A really fun set and is the best of the 3 airport playsets!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-30T14:11:05Z","Only 8 figures!","I wish they had made 12 the standard amount of figures for sets this size.  This set only manages 1 special one as well (the pilot).

This is a good set, but it would have been better with an additional plane or better helicopter, plus more/better figures and possibly some nice accessories.  A bigger airport with less baseplates would have been nice too.    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T12:16:55Z","A Fantastic Looking Set!","This set is so cool! Excellent runway, realistic looking control tower, and the security gate is just hilarious! The jet is cool and the baggage car is just awesome. You can play with this set of hours! So many possibilities! Oh did I mention this set is huge? 4 32x32 baseplates + a 16x32 for the terminal.

Looking at the other airport sets, this set is the best looking.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-23T17:45:27Z","Great Airport but 6597 is better","This was my first big set.I got it for Christmas in 1992.
Well I needed plenty of time on assembling it back then,because I was only 4 when I got it,so I wasn't a fast builder in those days.
Now to the Set: It's another great classic from the 80s to early 90s-range.I like the Model,but 6597 is way better than this.The Helicopter looks cool but a bit boxy.The plane is realistic,but I think it's somewhat slower than the one from 6597.The cart is cute and looks realistic.Well the building is very tropical-looking.But the Tower sits upon that,which isn't really realistic as the tower is too high.In the first airport it's a lower one.Well I like those Flags on the roof and the alternates are great,like the Racetrack or the border-like building.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"justrock","2007-10-28T16:52:20.903Z","Fun but not the best","Something about the lack of windows always bothered me about this set. Sure it has those two huge ones, but some small ones would help the look. The plane is good, and the extra long runway made it feel more real. Funny how the control tower looks better here than on the later model.
Suppose this is a good set for a younger builder to tackle. Otherwise I say the airport needs more added onto it, and the chopper could be tweaked a little.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legotowner","2011-03-05T23:57:48.5Z","My favourite set that I owned","<p>Received this one for a birthday, was dissapointed that we had to go out for lunch as I had an airport to build. Everything was just so exciting, pack your suitcases you two passengers.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pro 1 The plane was the first thing I built. It had&nbsp;3 seats inside although you could reconfigure it to fit 4. I replaced the engines under the wings as I thought it looked better. The pilot was very cool with his cockpit computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro 2 The terminal building was very well designed especially with the large bright room with the big windows, the luggage shute, the outdoor viewing platform with seats, the control tower which looked great with its big windows and height and a cool setup inside</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pro 3 The luggage cart was good looking, drove well and could fit anywhere else in town if you wanted to move it</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pro 4 The runway was a good size and with the apron in front of the terminal, the size was great.</p>
<ul>
<li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Con 1 The helicopter did look good, it just served no purpose other than to transport the pilot, it also had nowhere to land when the plane was parked at the terminal. 
<li>Con 2 Just a couple of wierd things, why were there 2 gates next to each other when there was&nbsp;only room for 1 plane, and there were 2 mailboxes in the waiting room under the timetable, what were they for? Maybe 1 more passenger to fill the plane would have been better than having 4 airport staff.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-20T04:21:59.15Z","LEGO Town (Flight) - International Jetport Review","This is one of my favourite airports which LEGO did and this is one of my oldest sets I have as well. This set is also a great addition to any LEGO city for sure. This model is an easy build and we also get a few stickers to worry about. We get lot's of stuff like a helicopter, a plane, a cart with a trailer, an airport and the airstrip. The trailer of the cart can be removed very easily and the helicopter has a propeller on the top and on the back which spin full 360°. The windscreen of this helicopter opens very nice and easy, too. The plane has an engine on each side, a tyre on the bottom which sviwels full 360° and a trunk on the back where the people can keep their luggage. The middle of the plane does open if you want to put in the minifigs and the ceiling of the cockpit does open very easily as well.<br><br>The airport is very cool as well. We get a nice tower which has an office in the inside and a radar on the top which sviwels full 360°. On the top of the building next to the tower you can see two chairs for the figures and there're also two flags which look very nice. On the front you can see two different entrances and a place where the people can get their luggage in the middle of these entrances. In the inside is a security check where you can see a red gate. There's also a place where the figures can stor their luggage and wait for the plane. It's a great set to have for sure and I really can't complain about it.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
