"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-05T17:18:08Z","Great gas station, tons of features","When I bought this set, I was delighted to get an attractive gas station with a car wash, tow truck with working winch, car and floor jack.  There is tons to do with this set!

I have just ordered the 6394 auto center and am delighted!  I think that this is the only auto-themed set that I would prefer over this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bsmarthen","2007-04-01T23:31:34.44Z","Differant","This set is great, the gas pumps and the overhead roof are cool. The car wash has its good parts but no roof. This set could have been better if it came with some parts for inside the store. Still, overall a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legofan5445","2008-02-13T10:52:42.577Z","Truely a legend! ","Truly a legend set! Nice details in it, like an okay size shop, garage, car wash, 3 pumps, overhead canopy, tow truck with working winch, classic car, Octan minifigs and many more! Get this set if you ever come across it as it truly is a legend set and in my humble opinion, the best service station ever! (It's a tough fight between this and 6378 though, but this set has a tad more things in it).

Pros: Wonderful design
      Tow truck with working winch!
      Classic car looks cool! 
      Medium size shop and garage! 
      Working car wash! 
      3 pumps and beautiful overhead canopy

Cons: Unavailability... Get it if you see it! The best service station ever!
      Decals... Plenty of them, especially the Octan decals on the outside signboards that drive me nuts as the decals overlaps 3 bricks.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- marvellous architecture</li><li>- nice cars</li><li>- good car wash construction</li><li>- many useful windows</li><li>- white basic parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>- too less figures</li><li>- sticker</li><li>- poor inventory</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>The first and in my eye the best octan release Legoland has ever seen. It's also the best gas station in lego history. Don't wonder Lego re-released this legendary set and get it.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"arl100","2012-09-09T14:11:34.073Z","Good set made in the days of proper Lego","<p>Managed to pick this up quite cheaply the other day, having decided that licensed sets are hammering my wallet too much. I had always been interested in a small petrol station (as they are&nbsp;called here in the UK) for a while, but Star Wars sets were getting all the money. After re-arranging my priorities for sets, I decided this appeared to be the better between this and 7993. I was not disappointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The set itself is still very symbolic of many petrol stations seen today, 20 years later,&nbsp;with the overhanging roof and car wash on the side. I particularly like the layout of the forecourt and the roof, both of which are well designed, and combining this with the tanker from the same year (6594) is recommended for those who want a nice set to display or play with. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is quite hard to find these days, particularly with boxes, but is worth the money in terms of how you value it.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Well laid out in general</li><li>Nothing too flashy, goes back to the basics, which works well.</li><li>A very nice display piece.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Perhaps a bit more to the shop</li><li>Another car or set of pumps would have been welcome.</li><li></li></ul>
<p>Overall, a good set that works well as a display or play piece, far cheaper than most licensed sets, but unfortunately getting harder to find, especially in a reasonable condition.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
