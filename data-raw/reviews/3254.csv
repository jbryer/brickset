"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-17T15:49:35Z","The Best Police HQ","This is the best Police HQ of all. Even the 1996-HQ isn't as good as this classic. I got this set back in 1993. It was my christmas Present. The vehicles are all 80s to early 90s standart. The only thing missing for perfection is a Prisoner transporter to get the bad guy into it's jail.He can simply jump off the Police Offroader, so with that other vehicle he can't get out anymore. The helicopter has a little boxy appearance, but it's an really good design. The building itself is really big and has a great look. It has lots of rooms and even this is in two parts,which are connected by a bridge. The interior isn't extremely detailed but detailed enough for a Lego building. The nicest touch in the interior is a bed, which is a great recreation in the stressy police jobs.
Shortly a classic beauty!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Nice copter but one &quot;officer&quot; looks like a civilian or a con.. either one works.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"eggbert20","2007-11-07T06:39:49.06Z","Simply amazing.....","The first word out of my mouth is...Wow! This is, in my opinion, the best police station that Lego has ever produced. I also own the 1996 station, but to me this one is better. The building is quite large, with a nice, clean, architectural style to it. There is a nice gate to allow traffic in and out of the station. The main building consists of the prison cell, which includes 2 grey ladder pieces linked together to form the cell door. Inside the cell there is a cot for the prisoner. Above the prison is the break room for your weary Lego officers. It is complete with coffee maker, table, chairs, and mugs. The perfect place for your overworked Lego police force to relax after, or during, a long day's work. There is also a control room for keeping track of dangerous criminals, complete with computers and a cool fingerprint piece. 

There are some nice vehicles included in this set. There is the helicopter, with a realistic, aerodynamic look. There is room in the side of it for storage of weapons or any other type of police equipment needed. The chief's car is pretty simple, but it gets the job done. It does a good job of looking like a high-speed vehicle. My personal favorite is the police 4x4. It has the really nice suspension pieces for the wheels. This is, by far, my favorite part of the set. 

Also included are some good minifigures to get your police force started. My particular favorite is the detective (or so I call him!) with the black police hat and scruffy face. There is also a couple of regular officers and one that I call the &quot;chief&quot;. All in all, a good amount of figures for a set of this kind.

I would highly recommend picking this set up if you can find it. I don't even have mine built, but I am able to recall all the fine details. I loved this set when I first got it (back in 1994), and I still love it to this day. Do yourself a favor and buy this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bort17","2007-07-23T15:51:15.797Z","Great police headquaters!","   This is a great set.  It has five rooms and a jail.  The jail has a clever mechanism for keeping the door closed.  All the rooms have big windows and cool details like computers, tables, televisions, and fingerprints.  A footbridge connects the two parts of the building.  (I have noticed many newer Lego vehicles don't fit under the bridge).
   The vehicles are all cool too.  The chopper looks cool and has storage in the back.  (The only problem is when the helicopter is on the landing pad, it sticks off the edge of the base plate and you can't put another building right next to it.)  The jeep, motor cycle, and police cruiser are cool too.  
   This is a great set and I would recommend it to anyone, if it was still being produced.  Maybe Lego should make it a Lego Legend, because it is so awesome! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"piratetown","2007-08-01T16:09:27.253Z","Glass","The best thing about this set is the amount of full-length glass windows and glass doors. Those and the pillars mean that it is easy to build other things from this set. I used apartments with it. The thing I don't like about that generation of Lego cops is the lack of proper hats and uniforms, it's mostly leathers and caps and helmets. The helicopter and the little car are pretty boss though, and the special pieces are very useful, especially the barrier.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-10-28T02:54:36.233Z","Best Police Station","Man this is one sweet station! It's big without being too massive, you know just a well-designed layout.

"hustla187","2008-05-03T22:17:19.45Z","This is a Legend","This is the real Lego police station. It has everything you want and nothing you don't. The building are very cool including the balcony. The motorcycle is just cool with the police sign on the side. The SUV has some really sweet suspension. Also, you get a ton of minifigs. This is a must own for any Lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-10T14:22:43.403Z","One Word: Epic","The police series has been a constant staple in Lego's most sold sets.  Every 2-3 years, a new police station (just like their fire and gas stations) would come out.  However this station set new standards, especially compared to what the fire series has not yet accomplished.

This station completely diverged from the previous designs of one garage plus 1-2 motorcycles + helicopter type of formula.  This thing was huge, had a toll booth, a motorcycle, helicopter, and two SUV-like cop cars.  Also a nice padded cell and a sprawling office.  

The multi-story complex makes this set feel busy.  Also, the archway going over the toll booth is a neat touch that has some original thought in how a building can be extended.  Some beds on top also give the police guys a place to rest when off duty.  Add to that all the elements of crime detection and you got yourself the best police HQ in existence!

Outside of the pure design aspects of this set, what I really like is the elements that accompany it.  This isn't a set that you can exclusively use for police purposes.  But the numerous windows, doors, computers and wall pieces allow you to convert this set into a major office type of building.  If you had the bucks and bought a good grouping of these sets, you can build a whole city alone on this type of set.  

I think one good standard to use in judging a set is whether or not you would be willing to purchase it again and again.  This is a set that suits that purpose because you can easily use this set for other purposes.  Some sets you just can buy once if you're a hardcore collector, but they don't serve a good purpose interchangeably when you purchase it a second time because the parts are too specific.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2009-11-12T16:55:15.967Z","Best police station before 2008","This is actually my first Lego set bought in 1994. All the other police stations that came after, up to 2008, were way worse or just terrible. All the others that preceeded were simpler and less realistic too, but before all Lego sets were simpler.
I think only 7744 can beat this one in terms of design and functionality. But it was released 14 years later! So it must be better. However the famous 6398 was more than everything needed. It has a sleek design, enough rooms. Nice combination of minifigs, 4 (!) vehicles: a motorbike, a chief's car, a cool 4WD (with real sweet suspension!) and a helicopter. There is somewhat like a garage under the bridge. And the tallest building has four floors, the upper deck used as a rest-room (it has a bed).

The site has a helipad, quite nicely made, two beds of flowers, a cafe etc.

I really don't see any negative points to this set, and that's not because it's my first one. This set is really very well worked out. And it became somewhat classical. It was a pity that it was replaced by 6598 just 2 years later. 6598 offered a prison unit on an isle but that was its only advantage.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Montana_8","2010-07-08T23:29:08.163Z","Keeps Lego City Safe","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion this is the best police station that Lego&nbsp;made. It has a lot of space, including a detective's office with a desk with specalty pieces showing finger prints, a meeting room with a table, chairs and a coffee machine, a room with a phone specialty piece (my best guess is that it's for wire taping), a main office with city map and computer, a prison cell, a supply room, a spare room&nbsp;with&nbsp;nothing in it (I modified it and made it a medical&nbsp;bay), and a room with a cot in it that I use as a extra prison cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The helicopter and motorcycle are nice, but the car and truck are lame. Both the car and truck aren't&nbsp;very realistic and have a horrible design. The set has some good minifigures. Overall, the building has a realistic design with lots of details. I would recomend the set to anyone who is looking to start or improve&nbsp;a Lego city police collection. </p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T12:17:14.147Z","Book'Em Dano.","<p>Set #6398 Central Precinct HQ: This set to this day is one of my all time favorites because of how much fun I had with it, even as a teenager, this is one of the better police stations LEGO made in the Town Theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Central Precinct HQ itself is a building that looks modern and impressive, it doesn't use a lot of pieces to make walls because of the numerous window pieces that were included in the set, but that adds to the modern look of the Central Precinct. It also allows you to look in on the computer table and monitoring stations that you build for the interior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a small jail for the criminal to be put and four vehicles for the Officers, a motorcycle, a truck, a helicopter and a car. This set used stickers for details on the windows and the computer monitor pieces. (I still have a fair number of pieces from this set, all of the large windows, the doors, the computer monitors, a piece from the helicopter and a few other items. I could probably pick up a large bag of pieces from LEGO's online store to restore this model... With exception to the unique road plate that was part of this set.) The plate used featured green areas for grass and a small road for the vehicles to park on, attaching other road plates to the set allowed for them to go racing off into the street to track down the crook or apprehend speeders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, though some might not appreciate the lack of proper walls on this set, I enjoyed it quite nicely as it made for a more modern looking police station as opposed to older stations, the four rapid response vehicles and the numerous Mini-Figures were all great. I think I'll be adding this to my wants list and looking to restore it&nbsp;to my collection.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"iamcjb","2011-01-09T13:27:13.833Z","My Favourite Set","<p>I bout this set many moons ago with some birthday money around the same time as my sister had acquired a good bit of City and Paradiso and my two friends had an Airport and Fire Station.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions were excellent and easy to follow. The box was large enough that if I needed to store it in a hurry I didn't need to fully destroy it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There is a good variety of bricks. The main building is mostly larger pieces, primarily made up of full length windows and white columns. The vehicles and indoor decor used up more smaller pieces. One of my all time favourite pieces was included in this set, was the two tapes you get for the recording equipment. While they were small and seemingly insignificant, my friends and I thought they were cool and useful when making a spy base or recording studio. I also thought the board with the road was pretty unique as it split the lanes for a checkpoint.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There were five figures:</p><p>A police chief</p><p>A rugged looking police man who I assumed was for the off road vehicle</p><p>Two officers wearing shades and a helmet which suited the role of biker or pilot.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build required two boards for two seperate towers. A bridge joined the two towers together. I found the build to be varied as despite the building essentially being two conjoined rectangles, there is plenty of angles, and the indoor decor, garage area and vehicles provided plenty of building for smaller parts. The set did have some stickers, but they actually looked well compared to today's standards and I think they add rather than taking away from the model. A first time build could easily use up a couple of evenings.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>An impressive looking piece. The HQ seemed to tower over most models at the time. I also thought the design was something different with it's glass and white block style design. Combined with the angles for the roof it reminded me of something similar to the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World. The building was well detailed, with three rooms filled with various computers and equipment. There was also a garage/ workshop style area and a coffee room with proved tools and mugs to add more pieces to the collection. The building was finished off with a bedroom for the officers, a jail cell complete with lock, checkpoint with working arm and a helipad. The addition of a bridge over the road added some detail to the sometimes spartan looking road tiles. Four different vehicles and five minifigs rounded off the set perfectly and also allowed some playing time without the need of the building.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A truely impressive set that can rival any of the castles or other large City sets. I played with this so much that to this day I could still build it from memory. The building is so large it can be downscaled and created into a smaller station plus another complete building. I still think this was the best value for money Lego set I ever owned. I believe I acquired it for £45 which today would be the cost of half a castle. In my opinion this set could be twice the cost of a castle and still be worth it. Kids will be able to play with it for eternity, and those a little older will be able to enjoy the sheer size and design of the building. I doubt any Police set will ever top this.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"seanchump","2012-02-02T15:11:08.237Z","The BEST Police set","<p>I remember saving all summer for this set in 1993. I obsessed over this set back then and I still do now. It's the best overall Lego set from my classic town collection.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The building is handsome in design. Stands tall and looks official.
</li><li>Quick, easy fun build.</li><li>Piece variety is good. Amazing quality and detail for it's time. The printed mug shot matches the inmate's ID number. Police have lots of tools. The helmet has printed Police logo. The crossing gate is genius and the whip antenna with rotating radar make the stand out.</li><li>The vehicles include a Motorcycle, Squad car, Truck, and Chopper. The
Pickup truck is by far the best in the set. It looks rugged and has working suspension. The chopper is a close second with it's sleek design.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The set shows age when placed in a Modern City setting.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>There are no rear walls on the building, and the top floor is nothing more than a bed, but this set was made for&nbsp;play-ability and Central Precinct HQ delivers. Top 10 for sure.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"alphonsus","2015-10-30T22:31:46.267Z","Good as a police station, better as an office block","<p>I got this set from eBay despite already owning 6386: Police Command Base which I use as the main police base in my layout. It is of the same era of building style as much of the rest of my layout, including 6380: Emergency Treatment Center, 6394: Metro Park &amp; Service Tower, 6540: Pier Police, 6543: Sail N&#39; Fly Marina and 6597: Century Skyway airport. Specifically it has the skylight/roof windows and 1x2 45-degree roof bricks capping the walls.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s got a great range of parts, starting with the structure of the building itself, which has great number of parts that can be reused as a range of buildings. There aren&#39;t any unique parts that had to be invented to make the set work (an idea I hate as it counteracts one of the great features of Lego which is to be inventive, creative and solve problems in a build without resorting to a special brick). There is a good array of printed parts - screens, displays, etc. that lend a feel of purposefulness to the finished build.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Pretty standard for the nature of the set, really.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was good fun. The instructions are comprehensive, unambiguous and allow you to proceed at a rapid pace. There were a couple of occasions where I wished I had a third hand, but in general it was entertaining, partly from the large number of pieces which extended the build time considerably.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I was impressed. Even though I ripped it apart for an office block with elevated sidewalks pretty quickly I was satisfied with the quality of the model and its functionality. I wasn&#39;t completely impressed with the design of the cell door - which wanted to come apart fairly quickly, but that minor niggle aside, it&#39;s a great set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like it. I like it more now it&#39;s part of my skyline as the unusual height of the model (4 floors isn&#39;t overly common in any Lego model) gives a sense of being in the middle of downtown. I&#39;m only giving it 4/5 simply because it&#39;s not doing it&#39;s intended job for me because I prefer 6386.</p>
