Also, legofan, you are definetly overeacting!!!  I think some of them are no bogus.  But I have to agree with you on the 1/10.  This set isn't that bad!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-24T00:27:22Z","BEST SET EVER","Hey guys and gals, I grew up with this set, its the first set I ever remember having, and it is my favorite lego set of all time. I remember waking up every morning as a lil kid and going down stairs to the family room and playign with it. It was the funnest set to build and the best Monorail/ train set ever made. Lego needs to take my advice and re-release this set as a legend, because if they dont, then Ill boycott them :)

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-24T19:17:02Z","BEST SET","This is the best Lego set ever made, Lrgo shoudl release it as a legend, its one of the largest lego sets and its the only twon monorail. Its hard to find this set nowadays, it was sold on ebay for 699.99 MISB, thanks god I still have mine, its one of my most prised possetions right up there with my wife :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-03T15:31:07Z","WOW!!","Bpught this on ebay because I never had it and I'm glad I did, excellent set, best Monorail out of the three and my personal favorite, looks great next to the main street and the octan sets, great town set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T22:48:49Z","Excellent","I have recently purchased this set for a trader in my city, I love it, excellent set and one of my favorite Lego sets ever, the set will provde your young ones loads of fun , the train itself can move either forward or backward and only requires 1 9V battery, the set has a lot of track and so you can customize the route your shuttle takes any way you want, the set also has two different terminals, one double decker level which is the platform that the shuttle will drop you off at in order to go to the airport, the other terminal is from the airport parking lot to the platform that takes you on to the shuttle in order to eventually get to the airport, the set provdes a bunch of lil mini-figures and provides suitcases and tickets etc. loads of features and many unique pieces including the rare monorail pieces wich have only appeared in two other sets both dating back two the late 80's and early 90's. Out of the 3 Monorails that Lego has produced this one is definetly the best, and with the other two being space monorails this is the only town monorail.

If you can pick this up its a must have for any lego collector and will go great with the new 10159 Centuary Skyway Legend coming this fall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-24T06:33:31Z","great set","I am sick of people who wants to lower a set's rating by giving fake 1'S!!!! So Mister B'eanheah' get out of here and give 1 to yourself. This set really deserves 1 acoording t you? Then you dont even know lego. This is the greatest rail set ever. It is beatiful and delicate.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-24T17:51:30Z","Astounding, but sad review","I am horribly dissapointed with Mister B's review. People like him/her do not make brickset a good place to review lego sets. He made no comment on exactly what was wrong. He sounds like a person who loves downer sets like Galidor and Jack Stone. I really hope other people aren't so bad with such wonderful sets without looking at it twice. It's just so sad. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-24T20:28:47Z","Amazing","Whoever posted the one for this set is just mad because it was the highest rated set, and his reasons where &quot; its a huge Lego set&quot; I didnt know that was a bad thing, anyway this setis excellent and IS the best Town set ever, I have 3 of them, it is the best monorail out of the three. Again i think the mods should delete that review of the guy who gave it a one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-04T17:27:59Z","The best town set","This is the heart of a city: the public transport system! Lego made once a set with a beautiful town monorail (really like a light rail system). The idea is really interesting, a city is not only police and fire dep.! The shuttle for the airport is my favourite set! It contains a lot parts, minifigs and monorail tracks! You can play days, months, years with it and it is never boring. Please, Lego, make it as Legend! I'm really lucky because I own a copy of this set, but I would buy many others if I could!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-16T10:17:55Z","What An Awesome Set!","I love this set! I love the idea of having a metroliner carry passengers from the parking lot to the airport! The metroliner itself is very cool with the windows that make it more modern. I think red was the best color choice for it, although it does resemble the firefighter's colors.  The stairs IMO are strong and reliable so that during rush hour, it will not collapse. The food stand is a great addition to the set.  If there are delays for patients' airflights, at least their is food to eat while they wait.  Overall, this set is wonderful and I recommend it to all people who love Classic Lego and train sets!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"ratz","2007-06-08T13:12:01.263Z","just to praise it once more...","so many reviews, but none from this year!

i don't have to stress that this legendary set is an absolute highlight, but it would probably look rather tiny next to contemporary sets, because it is only 4 studs wide, once made for the town scale of the 80s and 90s. 
in it's time it was, i think, the biggest set available, and after the time it takes to build it up you are rewarded with a huge and quite impressive monorail train.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-09T19:09:15.06Z","Best Town Set Ever!","Not inclduing the airport sets, this is a very excellent set. It is in a class of its own. The Airport Shuttle is very cool because it comes with alot of track and two stations. The monorail train is very cool and fun to play with. The two stations are very cool which makes it good in any town. This is one of the greatest Lego sets ever made and if you own it, you are lucky because they are expensive right now. It is in a class of its own.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-24T10:44:18.503Z","Classic","I'm not a big fan of Lego town sets, but this one is great, it's big and expensive, but it's worth it. It gives you tons of pieces and minifigs that are great for Lego towns. The track layout is great, there are no switches, but there are two different elevations and the layout is somewhat complex for such a basic assortment of track. This set also is probably a better buy than Lego's trains (which are great as well) because it comes with two stations, a more original track layout, can go up hills and is probably a bettervalue as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jsmtrspts","2009-01-09T12:05:10.827Z","GREAT SET","when i first purchesed this set i think it was less than $100.00 (i could be wrong it was awhile ago)new.  After a while i ordered the extension set for it and that just made this set even better. I just had this out  after 5 years in the basement so my son could see ,it still looks and operates like new.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"BigMac","2011-01-08T00:50:23.47Z","A very flexible and useful set to expand or combine with any lego city / town set","I bought this about 9 months ago, paid AUD 325.0 for it, luckily I could pick this up myself, otherwise I had to pay another $35.0 for a registered postage. Anyway, this one still broke my record of paying $318.0 for 8421.<div><br></div><div>It is expensive but it is more than worth, because what you have is not just a big set of its own. Actually, you have a powerful kit to alter or expand the lego city that you owned. You can have your monorails to go around the airport, farm, police station, service station and city corners etc. You may design your station anywhere in your city, it looks great and plays great.</div><div><br></div><div>Alternatively, lego passenger train sets, like 7938 can serve the same purpose, personally I find monorail is better, because it can easily going up and down, the tracks can be designed to two levels or even three levels, so it can go over roads or small houses in the city. Monorail utilizes the concept of 3D in a compact city.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros</div><div><br></div><div>1. The design of the red monorail train is just too good, it is small, with a width of only 4 studs, apart from cute and beautiful appearance, it is very functional also. The carriages and drivers chamber are openable. &nbsp;It can be set to go forward, backward or stop at the station. Its amazing to watch it running from station to station or reverse back in opposite direction.</div><div><br></div><div>2 &nbsp;The design of the stations, one is at high level and one is on ground, all details were carefully designed and were well thought of, it hard to be described by words.</div><div><br></div><div>3. The staircase, the burger stall &amp; its tables, the street lights underneath the station, the seats on the street and the telephone booth all enhance the reality and playability to almost perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>4. The tracks are very strong, the span of a straight track can go over 10"" without middle support, which allows you to put a small house, or a cross road underneath it.Really, the above is just a &nbsp;very brief summary of all the merits of the set, as I said it is hard to mention all the pros by words.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons</div><div><br></div><div>1. No exchangeable / crossover tracks like those for 6991, this limits the flexibility of track design for the purpose of going around the city. Other than this I cannot think of any.</div><div><br></div><div>My addition.</div><div><br></div><div>I use all the tracks that I have to run the monorail across my city. I add &nbsp;two passenger carriages. I used the monorail base and motor from 6990 and 6991 to create a blue and a grey monorail. It is not too difficult, but with good result, both monorail look as good as the original red one but the carriages cannot be open.I believe this is the most payable town/city set by Lego.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading.</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Mawich","2010-04-21T22:18:35.53Z","Perfection...but with ""Integration Problems""","It was and ever shall be a one of a kind... and the type of set that represented the best aspects of the Classic Lego Town theme...playability, versatility, enjoyability and durability.&nbsp; While there were countless other Police Stations, Fire Stations and Gas Stations, there was only ever one Town Monorail.&nbsp;&nbsp; And boy...did the designers of the time hit their straps with this set. <br><br>Though this set is as close to perfection as one is likely to find...there are a couple of things to consider when integrating it into a town layout. <br><br>This set can exist as a standalone ""train set"" which explains the extra
wide bases on the track supports (also known as stantions).&nbsp; One down side of these wide bases is attempting to integrate the set into an existing town layout. To get around this problem, I used 2x2 round bricks, stacked 10 high instead of using the supports provided. <br><br>This approach meant I was able to avoid the problem of track supports overlapping onto roads (there's pictures of the approach at http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?m=mawich).&nbsp; <br><br>Another problem is the height of the track is 10 bricks above roadplate level.&nbsp; This is fine for most Classic Town vehicles except for vehicles such as 6335 (Indy Transport).&nbsp; However, this is easily rectified by increasing the height of the overall layout by a couple of bricks.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
