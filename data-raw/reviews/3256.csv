"peti7788","2021-05-18T18:24:14.87Z","The real fire chief's car","<p>Finally a small firefighting set from 1978 in which the minifig fits in the vehicle.&nbsp;In fact, the only&nbsp;firefighter set that knows this capability this year, in addition, only the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/590-1/Engine-Co-No-9"" target=""_blank"">374/590</a> large fire stations are capable of it.</p>

<p>Again, this set was given an overly obvious and lame name. It would have been more like this fire chief&#39;s car.&nbsp;Instead of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/602-1/Fire-Chief-s-Car"" target=""_blank"">602</a> set, we would have done better with that.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifig</strong></h3>

<p>The torso was even decorated with a sticker.&nbsp;A gray air tank is quite difficult to find, rare and expensive.&nbsp;Even though it was used for many early space sets, such as the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/886-1/Space-Buggy"" target=""_blank"">moon buggy</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Car</strong></h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just see, a couple of new parts for vehicles were released that year, which can also be found in this set. For example, 2 brick high windshields, chassis, fenders, car doors, steering wheel (<em>which is very much missing from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/590-1/Engine-Co-No-9"" target=""_blank"">590</a> set</em>)&nbsp;These are all ridiculously basic parts, but then it was a novelty!</p>

<p>The headlight is also the older 1x4 brick with chrome color printing on it.&nbsp;There is a sticker on the doors.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The trailer is quite weak, the storage capacity is minimal</strong> compared to how many plates&nbsp;it is built of.&nbsp;All spaces are 2 plates deep and 2x3 plates wide.&nbsp;The equipment will fall out if we put it all in.&nbsp;Yet at that time there was already a 1x4 fence piece.</p>

<h3><strong>My Mod</strong></h3>

<p>I only used parts that were available in 1978. I made a simpler trailer that would fit all the equipment.&nbsp;The gray fence element comes from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/590-1/Engine-Co-No-9"" target=""_blank"">590 set</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building experience</p>

<p>Whilst I do not own this set new even with just the parts and not the feel of opening the box of your brand new lego set it was still a solid experience although with some outdated building techniques in the trailer but not a major knock against it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are good but outdated and worn and only really uses basic parts it still uses good parts nonetheless.</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>I think it has good playability with its 1 fireman minifigure and you could turn the trailer into a custom build for the fireman to put out. And with some of the other first wave lego town fire it goes well with set number 590.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for money&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whilst I do not know how much it retailed for I would guess something like 4.50$ US, today it will be about 20$US used on Brick link which isn&#39;t to bad for what it is.</p>

<p>Overall I believe you should pick one of these up if you like city or town fire or just like fire veichles.</p>
