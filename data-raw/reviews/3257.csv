Pieces: nothing special 7/10
Playability: great 10/10
Minifig: good helmet, same old head, seen better torso 7/10

Over all 8/10

You just cant help but play with it. It screams &quot;DRIVE ME&quot;. Don't ask me why, it just does.

It's a cute little racer consisting of a whole 19 pieces. He has the number 5 on the front. The racer Himself id dressed in red. He has a white helmet and a solid black visor. He is part of the Octan Racing Team, sporting their logo on his jacket.

No faults with this model but can you really make a mistake in 19 pieces?

Overall its a nice little buggy. Looking slightly wider than your normal racer is a good addition to all racers collections and a good one for collectors too. 5/10 from me :)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The minifig is the usual 'cool boy with sunglasses' kid and is sporting a red Octan racing jumpsuit. The vehicle moves very smoothly and you don't hear any little squeaks as you might do from other tyres.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-27T00:29:46.56Z","A middle of the pack racer","<p>I think this might have been one of the earliest sets I had as a kid, and I have no idea where it came from.&nbsp; Maybe from a local Coles or a petrol station?&nbsp; It probably just appeared in my house one day.&nbsp; I distinctly remember the yellow bar piece and the red Octan torso, and those yellow-walled tyres screeching around my car city rug on the floor.&nbsp; It was later disassembled and has since become one with my parts collection, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>But I recently acquired a second set, with instructions, from a bulk lot on eBay, so I figured I would give my thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some nostalgia attached to this set so take this one with a grain of salt.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The building process is short, brisk and the whole model comes together quickly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty simple build here, with the tyres snapping onto the axles and the whole thing being a 1x6 plate.&nbsp; The whole go-kart, excluding the tyres, is about 10 pieces or so, so it&#39;s quite impressive they made a passable facsimile of a go-kart with so few pieces.</p>

<p>I think it does look like a go-kart, given the parts budget they had to work with and I think a kid would understand what this is supposed to be.&nbsp; That said, there&#39;s not a lot of room for modification or improvement without a lot of your own spare parts - but that&#39;s what Lego is about!</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Not a wide assortment on offer here.&nbsp; I mean, half of the parts are the minifigure and the tyre assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The red printed &quot;Octan&quot; racing team torso isn&#39;t that rare, despite what some may say. It showed up in 21 sets from 1994 to 1999, so don&#39;t go busting your bank trying to get it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s actually rare is the printed tile with the &quot;5&quot; on it.&nbsp; That tile only turned up in one set - this set right here (it also turned up in the different&nbsp;variants of this set, 6406-1 and 1096-1, but those sets are just different numbered versions of this set too).&nbsp; It&#39;s not super expensive or anything, usually goes&nbsp;for a couple of cents on Bricklink, but I felt it was worth mentioning that it turned up here.</p>

<p>Lastly, those little round smooth wheels are always great - you could repurpose them for a Formula 1 car or a little town runabout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a vehicle, a speedy go-kart, so naturally you&#39;ve got play options from the start.&nbsp; Pop the minifigure in and get racing around the house.&nbsp; You can race it around town, past your other models.&nbsp; Maybe it could be a little buggy to race on the beach?&nbsp; And with some modification and spare parts, it could become a moon buggy, a racecar or a maintenance rover.&nbsp; I could even see this being a golf cart or an airport baggage car with the right modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t really a model to display as it doesn&#39;t have much to the visual aspect.&nbsp; It&#39;s so simple that it&#39;s basically some wheels slapped on 1x6 plate.</p>

<p>I think where this set shines is that I think it&#39;s a perfect little model of a go-kart, and if you had a few of these in a little town set-up, you could easily play go-karts with your minifigures.&nbsp; It&#39;s not too complicated, and any part that comes off is easily replaced (except for maybe the printed &quot;5&quot; tile)</p>

<p>Now look, I&#39;m not going to lie, this isn&#39;t a <em>very</em> useful vehicle for a city layout.&nbsp; When I think of infrastructure or amenities in a city, my mind only goes to go-karts on about the seventh or eighth hour of thinking.&nbsp; This is an impulse purchase, a stocking stuffer, one of those little sets you might get from a particularly nice family member or a friend at a birthday.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>This set is incredibly cheap, and you can find it on eBay for about $3 Australian or so, and sometimes new in box for around that price.&nbsp; It sometimes get inflated by virtue of the fact that it is a &quot;retro&quot; set so I wouldn&#39;t be spending much more than $3 to $6 dollars on this.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m biased here because I had this set as a kid. I loved it and still enjoy it.&nbsp; But honestly, there&#39;s nothing to really recommend here other than a little go-kart and a nice printed minifigure.&nbsp; If you see it super cheap on eBay, or someone on Bricklink has it in their store and you need to get it to make shipping or postage worthwhile, do it.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can pass it by.</p>
