The gray, white, and pink bricks look great together.  There are several unique pieces in this set, like the parot, the green &quot;vines&quot;, the sailboat platform, the sail itself, a cup, and an umbrella.  Female minifigs are more abundant in the Paradisa series than in any other LEGO theme, and there's a dark-haired female minifig wearing lipstick in this set.

I think LEGO did a good job in making this series appeal to girls while not losing sight that it is still LEGO after all, not Barbie dolls or jewelry sets.  I wish LEGO would bring back Paradisa and get rid of the Bellville theme, which hardly looks like LEGO at all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set was definitely not picked out by me--- chances are it was bought for me and my female cousin to play with together. In my circle of AFOL friends, Paradisa is a somewhat elusive theme, but quite sought-after by a lot of City AFOLs. These sets carried the first pink bricks (if my&nbsp;memory serves me right), and also possibly the largest amount of females in a single theme. Its target market is clear, and that's probably why alot of AFOLs didn't get these sets---as kids/teens we thought they were too ""girly"". </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back then it was&nbsp;much&nbsp;harder to get your hands on the ladies, so this was one of the few females I owned. The legs were flesh&nbsp;with white hip, a combo that almost exclusively appears in the Paradisa theme, so there is no doubt to its rarity. The&nbsp;torso is also quite rare, making this&nbsp;minifig a good one to own. The male is your typical dude, nothing to write home about. Both are good additions to your bustling City, they just need a change of pants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sailboard and mast are the eye catchers here. They still look great after all these years, and from what I see the sailboard is making a comback in the 2011 Harbour subtheme. There are no stickers, so that makes the umbrella/sunshade extra good. Thr rare pink chairs/cups/fences add variety to your collection, and you can never go wrong with more animals. The gray curved plates are also really useful in MOCing. A small but solid collection of pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much of a build. It's built exactly like it looks. The sailboard is put together in a couple of steps.&nbsp;The small boat was a bland and uninspiring build. The little rest station serves its purpose, but needs serious renovations to meet the more complicated build of sets today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess for its intended market it's good, but for me it's just part of the seaside diorama. Not really enough things to get the action going, I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the Paradisa exclusive pink accessories and nice sailboard&nbsp;this set carries,&nbsp;I think it's acceptable to&nbsp;pay up to about USD$12 for this set. However, I don't think you should search exclusively for this set, as the other Paradisa sets look much better than this one does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A set that rides on the strength of its parts. The build is what you see. Pursue this set only if you are a collector or want the pink parts. Otherwise, you're not missing out on too much.</p>",TRUE,2,4,1,2,3
