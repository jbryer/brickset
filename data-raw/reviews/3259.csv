"Elle82","2008-01-01T18:39:09.903Z","Cute Little Set","Love the little icecream blocks, two minifigures and a bike are always handy. It is very simple, and no doubt was inexpensive at time of original release.
If you are a paradisa lover, and you dont own it, its a lovely little addition if you can spare the cost!!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2009-07-06T13:16:15.64Z","A lovely piece of a true Paradise","When Paradisa appeared in stores, I thought that it was too girlish - these pink blocks and other strange parts... But my mother bought me this small set as a present for my good marks at school, and I really enjoyed it. I used the details in different sets of my own, and now I understand, that my mom was really clever to buy such a wonderful set.

Basically You got a small cafe, with two awesome archways, an umbrella as well as 2 blocks of icecream and a cute girl with a red bike.

I can't see the reason that anyone wouldn't like this Cafe.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Great scenery, complete and for this set lovely colours. Paradisa sets are not something I would (or will) collect but this is, looking at it neutral, simply a splendit Lego set.</p>
