"Wipipi","2017-09-03T02:00:51.92Z","Very Peaceful Little Set","<p>I recently purchased this set for my sister for her birthday. I chose this set because it&#39;s cheap, cute, and comes with great fun! Let&#39;s talk about the <b>Pros </b>and&nbsp;<strong>Cons</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>They really thought about the play value of the set while designing it all those years ago. You can play with the seesaw, slide your figures down a slide, dig in the sand box, and so much more!</li>
	<li>There&#39;s some pretty nice pieces for such a small set. It even comes with three figures and a retro style carriage!</li>
	<li>You get two baseplates, which can be very useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>My sister always loves getting parrots in sets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Not really much to say. Instead of using two small baseplates&nbsp;they could of made it one medium sized baseplate and added more to the set, but that would make it more pricey.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I do think this is a very good set, for it&#39;s size and value. It&#39;s focused more towards younger folk, but it does the job. If you can find this set complete for under 20 dollars&nbsp;<em>(Like I did)</em>, I definetely recommend buying it!</p>
