"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-25T11:59:34.5Z","Almost perfect as almost all Paradisa seta","We got this set as early as in 1996 when Paradisa was one of the most advanced series to date.

This set is not very big but comes at a moderate price. It has 2 minifigs, one of which is a nice girl. On the main photo we can see two persons holding each other by hand, which makes me think the man is not a simple coachman ;)

The set is not very big, I repeat, but it comes with 3 (!) animals: the horse, a colt and a parrot. The carriage is simpls but nice. The coachman has quite a lot of accessories (saddle, whip). A small cafe under the leaves is a very good addition, too. What is also good about the set that it has a lot of plant stuff, being not very big.

And the colour scheme - it's typical of Paradisa but nice though.

So, I give this set 5. And I really regret Lego don't produce sets of this calibre any longer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
