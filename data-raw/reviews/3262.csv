The &quot;stable&quot; could use some work (one fence is supposed to keep the horse in?&quot; but the roof pieces are nice and I've used them for many models since.

I still keep the trailer put together and it's a very well put together model. The stables on the other hand kinda stinks but the peices are nice and it's creative, thus the rating of a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Nice printed panels on the side of the trailer. The horse looks cool popping his head out of the trailer. The pink plates are a great touch of color to an otherwise white and gray set. This is a great technique that LEGO employs. You don't need a ton of every color to make that color stick out. The Bridge Chase (#8135) uses this technique to add a punch of orange to the gas station. This is a valuable lesson/technique to learn because I know that I don't have to run to ebay to buy a ton of the newest colored bricks.
The minifigs from this set are perfect, especially the red haired girl with printed shirt. The best parts by far are the gray slopes used to make the roof of the stables. These slopes are printed with a rock pattern that are begging to be used in MOC's.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
