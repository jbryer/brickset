It&#39;s a Go-Kart, granted, so it&#39;s going to not be maybe the world&#39;s most useful model, as go-karts in real life are not the world&#39;s most useful vehicles. There is an extremely limited amount of applications for the prototype and as such there are extremely limited applications for the set in your Lego town. If you&#39;re a kid you&#39;ll probably like this by virtue of it being something with wheels that goes fast and can race other cars, but even then you&#39;ll probably want one of the sixty thousand actual race car impulse sets made instead of this.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>I guess if you squint hard enough this thing&#39;s a go kart. It has four wheels, a steering wheel, and what looks like two exhaust stacks on the back (which is both a nice touch, and the only touch, as this is quite possibly the most barebones set I have in my recently unearthed collection). The little number &quot;5&quot; tile on the front is sort of neat. The bumper... exists, which is about all I can give it, and there&#39;s a rollbar because this is a 1997 vehicle set, meaning the rules are: 1) rollbar 100 percent of the time, even in applications that make no sense for there to be one, 2) no doors, 3) no roofs, especially in vehicles that would never have no roof in real life. This one is immune to rules two and three but adheres to rule 1 to a T.</p>

<p>I guess my biggest thought looking at this thing, other than that this is one seriously tiny set, is that it&#39;s pretty wide, something I don&#39;t think go-karts actually are (though I admittedly am not an expert on this topic). It&#39;s almost as wide as it is long, due to the extended wheelbase axle bricks used, so there&#39;s that. The minifigure is a welcome addition and probably the only reason to buy this in 2017, there just isn&#39;t a ton of other details to talk about with this thing. It&#39;s a plate with a rollbar, exhaust, a steering wheel, and the number 5 on it.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>When you review late nineties sets this is always the hardest category to rate on, and this set is no exception. There is nothing even remotely interesting about the build here so I&#39;m giving it a one. You can, no joke, build this thing in ten seconds. It honestly looks more like a MOC that a five year old would cobble together out of spare parts than an official Lego release, but yet here it is. Not that that&#39;s necessarily a bad thing, just that there is nothing even remotely interesting about the build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>I&#39;ll give it a three here. Mind you, it barely has any parts (23 total and most of that is minifigure and wheels) so it doesn&#39;t take much to impress me in this regard. The minifigure&#39;s torso is extremely rare and only found in a few sets (my review on one of them coming soon) and the (printed, because this is the 90&#39;s and that&#39;s what Lego did best) &quot;5&quot; tile brick is actually pretty rare and can be re-purposed into a better, more interesting model than this. The rollbar brick looks fine, and the cool old-style smooth tires are always welcome. You pay for the minifigure and the tile, but considering you&#39;re not paying almost anything that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>If you&#39;re a kid, it&#39;s a vehicle with a minifigure so how can you go wrong in this category? You can race the thing around with other, better race car sets. You can also take it apart and make it into a race car with minimal spare parts and effort. Nothing really wrong with the playability. The displayability is basically nil... It just doesn&#39;t look that much like a Go-Kart and unlike, say, the &quot;Open-Top Jeep&quot; model from the same time period, it also isn&#39;t particularly attractive or well designed in addition to being unrealistic, so again, the only real value is some cheap parts and a rare minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>The fact that it was and still is dirt cheap saves this from a one. They can be gotten for two or fewer dollars which means it&#39;s not a horrible value for some more wheelbases, a neat printed plate, and a race car driver (Octan sponsored, of course... No clue go karts had sponsors) minifig. There is literally zero reason to actively seek this set out, but if you have your cart full of other, better, more interesting sets on Bricklink and the seller has one of these for cheap it&#39;s not the worst impulse set on earth, it&#39;s just wholly unnecessary and not particularly fun. Not really recommended, but impulse sets are called that for a reason.</p>
