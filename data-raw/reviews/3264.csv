"oldfan","2012-02-24T15:08:55.157Z","A few parts, not much else","<p>Ah, the Town Jr. theme.&nbsp; I didn't realize how far TLG had proceeded down the juniorization path when I bought this set out of my dark ages (in the early 2000's).&nbsp; Immediately upon building this set, however, I found out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Town Jr. sets, as the name implies, use big shortcut parts to form the vehicles rather than the standard bricks and plates, for the most part.&nbsp; Thus, with this set you get a 2 x&nbsp;8 brick chassis with wheel mounts, a 4x4 plate, a 2 x 4 printed slope, 4 wheels, and a handful of parts which are&nbsp;accessories or greebles.&nbsp; Plus a minifig with the Town Jr. fire torso.&nbsp; And that's it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As pointed out by others, the printed fire hose assembly is always nice to have, as are the trans-blue parts and the minifig accessories.&nbsp; But as an adult builder or anyone serious&nbsp;about building with the LEGO brick, this set offers very little challenge or alternatives to the main model.&nbsp; You're better&nbsp;off parting out the pieces for use with your more detailed creations.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;the moustached minifig works well as a ""veteran"" fire chief...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in summary: If you have a youngster in the lower end of the stated 5-12 age range, they won't hurt themselves building this little car, and will likely have a good time racing it all over the floor.&nbsp; Once they become bored, they'll have some nice accessory parts for future building.&nbsp; As for me, I've learned to run far away from the ""6400"" Town range...</p>",TRUE,2,3,1,3,2

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 26 pieces and all of them are printed. Even if this set doesn't do much I think it's still worth getting, because you can use them for future MOC's and/or brickfilms.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has one minifig. The fire fighter has a black overall, a white helmet and a black beard on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy. I don't think you'll need longer than 5 minutes to build it.<br></p>

Just get it for the pieces and the minifig.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-07T19:44:58Z","Ladies and gentlemen, the second worst Town Jr. set!","<p>Continuing right along with my quest to review all the LEGO sets I&#39;ve recently unearthed from my childhood, here&#39;s 6407: Fire Chief. The Octan Gas Station set is probably the worst Town Jr. set, but oh man is this a close second.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong> Lego has made a lot of impulse sets that I&#39;ve loved and held near and dear to my heart. This is not one of them. It&#39;s supposed to be a small fire car, though I&#39;ve never seen one in my life that even vaguely resembles this one. The one-piece chassis never bothered me as a youngster, but the lack of, well, anything resembling an actual vehicle in this vehicle really did. There aren&#39;t doors. Or a roof. Or even a seat or anything to keep our poor friend the fire chief inside the car when it&#39;s rolling around. Obviously these things could all be added but they had to be added, as they are not at all present in the car&#39;s original model.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong> There is none. You put two plates on a pre-made chassis, put three blocks on the plates, then put three more blocks on top of that. That&#39;s it. There are no advanced building techniques, no interesting designs, nothing. The little clip that the axe attaches to is a welcome addition, it always used to bug me how Lego sets would give you a million minifigure accessories but not bother giving you anywhere for the figure to actually put them. However, it&#39;s too little... The radio has nowhere to clip onto and nowhere to go.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Probably the best part. The hose is pretty rare and handy. I always liked having the little premade chassis for the creation of bigger, better cars. The front grill is... okay. Not great, but okay, and not super common. The little transparent slopes are pretty rare too. The minifigure&#39;s a fun looking guy and I remember using him as the actual town fire chief, but that&#39;s about it. So a good amount of the parts are rare for how cheap the thing is.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong>: It&#39;s plenty playable... Once you&#39;ve done extensive modifications to it. As is the thing looks more like an empty platform with a steering wheel and hose on it than it does a car. However you can, and I did, make it into something better so there is that.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong>: High marks here. It&#39;s a cheap, three or so dollar impulse buy set, and the chassis and hose make it worth that. Not as good as it could have been had they added, say, a door. Or even walls to the car. Or a chair. But it&#39;s good.</p>

<p>Overall this set is better relegated to the dustbin of Lego history than anything. It&#39;s not very well made, has only a handful of worthwhile parts, and needs modification to make into something good. Lego can and has done much better than this.</p>
