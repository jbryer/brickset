"peti7788","2021-04-15T13:26:24.437Z","Basic Excavator - which is great!","<p>Another set of transition era.&nbsp;Even the construction philosophy of the mini-wheel&nbsp;era, the minifigure is not compatible with the vehicle, unfortunately you cannot put the minifigure in the vehicle.Now it knows as much compared to today&rsquo;s sets as a polybag set.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Very basic building&nbsp;technique.&nbsp;However, if you&rsquo;re lucky and you have the box, there are a couple of full-fledged alternative builds on the back.&nbsp;I think the designer put the digger bucket&nbsp;upside down.&nbsp;In reality, it used to be the other way around. The machine is digging towards itself.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of rare parts: the black hinge, the yellow vest, the 2x2x2 transparent slope&nbsp;brick,&nbsp;stickers.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>Nothing extra, just a standard smile face.&nbsp;There is only a print on the face.&nbsp;I miss the sticker on the high visibility vest. But photoshop and a good printer can do wonders.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>In fact, the set is completely playable, especially what alternative constructions come with it, with so few parts, excellent!&nbsp;Absolutely recommended!</p>

<p><strong>My mod</strong></p>

<p>It frustrates me that I can&rsquo;t put the minifigure in the vehicle. Plus I was interested in how I would have solved the task from the parts available in 1978.&nbsp;That was the result:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/75/d6/7c75d6bec24ad73b3b35b317331027ee.jpg"" style=""width: 3264px; height: 1836px;"" /></p>

<p>First, I took off the 2x4 black plate from the top of the chassis.&nbsp;I put a 2x2 turntable and two black tiles in its place.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the original version does not turn, it is fixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/1e/9b/c81e9bc01c7a6363a073d9a14ad52608.jpg"" /></p>

<p>And when we&rsquo;re done digging, we can lock it with a 1x2 brick to keep the turntable from turning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the machine is not to scale with the minifigure, but at least it can be put into it.</p>

<p>Since we only have a 4x6 yellow plate, we didn&rsquo;t fit the control sticks or a steering wheel, but I think it&rsquo;s still okay compared to the options.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f1/b2/95/f1b295982ae6abcd3f8876be4a6145e0.jpg"" /></p>

<p>From below, the machine is locked.&nbsp;This solution requires fewer parts and yet has more game value.&nbsp;</p>
