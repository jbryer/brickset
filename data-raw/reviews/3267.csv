Other than having a monkey, and changing rooms, theres nothing really new in this set that you cant find in other paradisa sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

pros:
- Monkey and parrot
- Boat and surfboard
- Nice baseplate
- Four adorable minifigs

cons:
- The water is painted on a green baseplate so if you scratch it you will see a green mark.

Pros:
Nice changing rooms with printed mirrors
Rare pink pieces
Monkey, printer crab, parrot, palmtree, surfboard, radio, fishing rod

Cons: 
Beach is quite small

All in all it's a good set if you want to have a nice beachside addition to your Lego-town",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
