"iamcjb","2011-01-20T16:04:21.287Z","Nice Accessories","<p>I got this set when I saw it on sale. My sister had some of the Paradisa sets, and I so I thought I'd get another set to add to it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are clear, but not really needed as the build is small.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not many building bricks, but it has many useful parts and I stress the many. First there's the board, which is painted to look like the edge of an island. Annoyingly, the green is a weird colour, but it's still an unusual board. The set also includes lots of little accessories such as cups, a pan, an ice cream cart, a bicycle, a windsurfing board and many more rare(ish) pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>There's 5 minifgs. A chef complete with chef hat, a lifeguard, a palm club worker and 2 female visitors, one of which has a lifejacket. I also quite like the hair on the two females as they are ponytails instead of the standard straight hair.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not much to build, and it's not complicated. Mostly you are making small individual parts such as the ice cream cart.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>A small café with a beach scene. The café doesn't hold may visitors which is unfortunate as there's plenty of room on the board. However, the board does not look bare as there's plenty else going on. The lifeguard station and ice cream cart are enough to make it look like a resort without any editing.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A nice set, but it's maybe lacking in content a bit. This is made up by supplying plenty of&nbsp;accessories.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4
"JoystickJunkie","2020-06-05T12:59:59.773Z","Greater than the sum of its parts - sitting down at the Sand Dollar Cafe","<p>When I flicked through the catalogues of my youth, I always passed Paradisa by, usually because it was lumped in with Scala, Belville or something like that.&nbsp; These sets weren&#39;t for me, I was interested in the UFO and Exploriens, I was interested in stuff blowing up and aliens taking over.&nbsp; Little did I know that years later, I wouldn&#39;t give UFO a second thought and would be chasing Paradisa sets around the world.</p>

<p>Paradisa is a line that I think is on the cusp of greatness.&nbsp; It&#39;s not perfect, some sets are a bit eh with their designs but the line as a whole has got this really brilliant style, or as the Internet calls it, aesthetic.&nbsp; And I&#39;ll admit, I love the aesthetic of Paradisa: sun-bleached, carefree, it looks like Miami, Key West or California through the lens of the 1980s with glass, pastels, the mall, juice bars, windsurfing, and lazy days at the beach.&nbsp; There never seems to be any stress or conflict depicted on the box of a Paradisa set.&nbsp; No police chasing crooks, or fire fighters rushing to put out a blaze.&nbsp; It looks relaxed, it looks like a vaporwave album cover and I like Lego sets that tell a different story other than eternal conflict or plain city scenes.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s have a proper look at the Sand Dollar Cafe, which made up one of the mid-range sets from the original 1992 release of Paradisa.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build process is simple.&nbsp; There&#39;s a little ice cream cart with umbrella you build first, and then you head into the build of the main cafe structure.&nbsp; The main cafe structure is built bottom to top, with you laying the foundations and then building up the main bar of the cafe.&nbsp; Then you go around the scene laying details like a fence, a bike, trees, bushes and there&#39;s even one little sub-build for the lifeguard station on the support beam.</p>

<p>Once it&#39;s all complete, it looks pretty good.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a particularly long build, you finish in about ten minutes or less, but it creates an interesting looking playset.&nbsp; You&#39;ve got a nice cafe build, some outdoor dining chairs, a deckchair, a lifeguard lookout, an ice cream cart and a windsurfer.&nbsp; You&#39;ve got an instant scene of a quiet day at the beach.</p>

<p>Build wise, one thing I think is a little poor is the deck-chair/beach lounge.&nbsp; It uses a white 1x4 plate and some slopes for the backrest.&nbsp; But the backrest parts aren&#39;t clipped together in any way, so they can just easily fall apart.&nbsp; A small 1x2 plate attached to it will remedy this, but it&#39;s still a bit annoying to see part of your set just rattle and fall about.</p>

<p>Minifigure wise, you get five great ones.&nbsp; You get a chef with a mustache and a chef&#39;s hat - this is always a plus for me, the classic 90s Town chef with the mustache and toque is so iconic and always looks great.&nbsp; You get two women, one with a life preserver on a windsurfer and another in a red strapless bikini top esque thing.&nbsp; Then there&#39;s a lifeguard who finds himself on duty, with the standard brown hair and sunglass face that dominated the 1990s.&nbsp; Lastly, there&#39;s a minifigure with freckles, blue cap and a white shirt with a palm tree.&nbsp; They could be any gender you want and could be either working the cafe, working the ice cream cart or anything else in between.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I think this set excels in the parts category, simply because so many of the parts are either vintage 90s Town and City parts or simply Paradisa line exclusives.&nbsp; In fact, I&#39;d argue that one of the main draws of the Paradisa line is the great line up of exclusive parts.&nbsp; Sure, this set only has 168 parts but it makes every part count.</p>

<p>First, the baseplate.&nbsp; I love this baseplate.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s the thing that brings this set from okay to great.&nbsp; I love the pastel colours, the five colours that run across it in wavy lines, the pale green colour of the grass like it&#39;s so sun bleached and sunny out here that even the grass is pastel.&nbsp; It&#39;s great for creating a beach scene and it&#39;s so ... stylish.&nbsp; It looks like something you&#39;d see in a vaporwave album cover.&nbsp; It&#39;s exclusive to this set, it never came out in any other set, nor in any other colour.&nbsp; I will say that due to the green not being the same green Lego uses on other baseplates, it can make it odd to combine it with other stuff you might have lying around but still, it&#39;s a great baseplate in my opinion.</p>

<p>Going on with the exclusive pieces, anything you see in the pale pink colour is a Paradisa exclusive which means the plates, chairs, taps, and the fence piece are all exclusive to the Paradisa line in that colour.&nbsp; They&#39;re not set exclusive but line exclusive.&nbsp; The pink utensil cups also appeared in some Belville sets, so they aren&#39;t exclusive but you get three of them here making it a great way to get some.</p>

<p>Now onto the glass panels:&nbsp; the 3x4x6 curved top panels are excellent for adding structure, some shaping and help to give this set a real 1980s feel.&nbsp; Three of these large glass panels are included here.&nbsp; Now they&#39;re not exclusive to this set in this trans-clear glass colour, but they were only used in this set, Breezeway Cafe and some building set from the 1990s (they also reappeared in a 2012 Friends set) so they&#39;re hard to find.</p>

<p>That end curved piece though?&nbsp; The convex panel in trans clear?&nbsp; It only came in this set and the Paradisa Poolside Paradise.&nbsp; This piece alone goes for $40 - $200 dollars in varying states of condition.&nbsp; They&#39;ve never made it in trans-clear since Paradisa.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just specialised or rare pieces here, there&#39;s a good amount of repeated parts here to help fill out your Lego inventory.&nbsp; You get lots of 1x1 tiles and white bricks, some large grey plates, slopes, a support and a ladder.&nbsp; You get a vintage Town bicycle in red, which is great to have as these things can get expensive these days.&nbsp; On the plant and greenery front, you get two old style spiky bushes and you get a nice big palm tree. Those palm tree pieces are just great, it&#39;s such a great piece and so versatile to this day. There&#39;s also the red &#39;Popsy the Parrot&#39; to sit atop the tree.</p>

<p>All in all, this set is a parts bonanza and I&#39;d honestly say to pick this set up just for the parts.&nbsp; It&#39;s that good and besides, the cost of the set as a whole means you get a bunch of other potentially useful stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s called the Sand Dollar Cafe, and knowing Lego&#39;s policy on alcohol they&#39;re PROBABLY not drinking alcohol so let&#39;s say it&#39;s a juice bar.&nbsp; But I mean, this has the whole vibes of a Miami beach side bar with fruity cocktails and cool beers.&nbsp; Leaving that aside, what kind of playability could you get from five minifigures, a cafe and a beach?&nbsp; I reckon you&#39;d get a lot out of this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A beach scene offers so much versatility for play: water creates danger, excitement, mystery.&nbsp; What if a shark attacked someone at the beach?&nbsp; Or there was a windsurfing contest or a drowning person the lifeguard had to save.&nbsp; What if there was a fire at the cafe?&nbsp; Start combining it with your other sets from the era and you can really go places.&nbsp; What if the Aquasharks burst out onto the surface and kidnapped someone as a hostage?&nbsp; What if...aliens?&nbsp;</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t have to go with danger or drama for a beach scene.&nbsp; Paradisa was about laid back beach vibes, relaxation and sunny days.&nbsp; What if your minifigures took a day at the beach to relax and kick back?&nbsp; Dipped into the ocean for a bit of a swim or met a friend at the cafe for a drink.&nbsp; What stories come from that?</p>

<p>You could make a criticism that it&#39;s a very static model, with nothing really &quot;going on&quot; .&nbsp; There&#39;s no play features or play function, no gears, trapdoors, revolving things, etc.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think this set was meant to really be that kind of structure or setting, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a fair point to make.&nbsp; Displayability is a bit hard to rank as it depends on your personal tastes, where you display it, etc.&nbsp; I think the baseplate would make it displayable, simply due to the bright colours and the eye-catching design.</p>

<p>I will say that I wish the cafe was easier to get your hands into as the roof and glass windows make it hard to get your fingers in there to place minifigures or moved them around.&nbsp; This could be remedied with some tile/plates to make the roof semi-attached and more easily removed, but as it stands it is a little difficult so that pushes the playability down for me as the cafe is a big part of this.</p>

<p>Another thing I think could have pushed the playability up to a five star is some more accessories like a camera or maybe a vehicle sub-build like utility vehicle you might see laden with surfboards in California, like a beach buggy or something.&nbsp; The bike is a decent vehicle, but I feel like a car or a pick up might have been a good addition.&nbsp; That&#39;s just me.&nbsp; What you get here is a lot of interesting pieces to start telling stories.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>I got this set for about $80 Australian dollars (AUD) and it was missing two or three easily found pieces but I still consider that to be a decent price for what I got.&nbsp; All the minifigures are in top condition with no scratches or fading, the glass panels are decent with minimal scratches and blemishes and the baseplate is in great condition.&nbsp; It came with the original instructions and an extra palm tree piece too.</p>

<p>As of June 2020, this set starts at $58 AUD on Bricklink and goes all the way up to $330 AUD for a sealed in box copy.</p>

<p>I think this set has great value for money on the parts front alone, with an exclusive baseplate, hard to find pink elements and those window panels, not to mention a palm tree, a bike, five minifigures and all the other useful pieces.&nbsp; But I don&#39;t think this set is worth more than $110 dollars at most, simply due to the relatively low piece count.</p>

<p>If you plan on picking this up, make sure that the window panels are in good condition/included and that the baseplate is in great condition.&nbsp; This is a set carried by the baseplate (no pun intended) so having it all faded and worn won&#39;t do you any wonders for display.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Paradisa often gets passed over on eBay for the other more desirable sets of the 1990s: the Pirates sets, the Castle sets, the Western sets.&nbsp; But I think this is a line that is starting to, and will become, vindicated by history.&nbsp; I think this is a line that is already becoming sought after by collectors for their design, their retro 1980s Vice City/Vaporwave aesthetics and their hard to find pieces.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to lie, the major draw of this set for collectors would probably be the parts.&nbsp; The set is not particularly iconic yet, nor does it have any major exclusives save for the baseplate and the curved glass panel.&nbsp; But I think this could easily find a home on a shelf, or integrated into a city layout as I plan to do in the future.&nbsp; It bears a lot of resemblance to the great Breezeway Cafe and could probably be combined into that too.</p>

<p>If you see one come up for cheap, absolutely grab it.&nbsp; If you want the parts the set has, still get it because the price alone of this set is worth it.&nbsp; It&#39;s a chintzy, sun-drenched 1980s gaudy looking set, but it&#39;s got a lot of charm and a lot of heart.&nbsp;</p>
