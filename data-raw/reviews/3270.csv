"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T18:36:08Z","Take on the waves!","   This, for a tinsy set, is awesome! I have always liked ResQ sets, and I love the suits they where. This is one of the few lego jet ski's that look realistic. The thing uses some good pointed pieces up front and a good structure in the back. It even had the classic handle bars that are used on ATV's and bikes.I give this set a super 10 because you cant have many screwups when a set is this small, but besides the size of it, it really has alot of playability in it! Take on the rough riders! Take on the waves! Take on nature!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-18T07:47:27.2Z","Wave Rider","Well their is definitely no need to describe what this model is. This would have to be one of the best LEGO representations of a jet ski ever. The general shape and style of the body immediately say what it is. The color scheme is good too, with yellow and black ensuring it will stand out in all weather. The front block is printed on NOT STICKERED so thats a plus. The controls for this vehicle are handlebars which again make it more realistic.

The mini-fig is dressed in a white res-q outfit with print on both sides of his jacket. He has a yellow life vest on, dark blue tint on his visor for his helmet and his face is the cool sunnies face.

No faults with this model as such a small model has no excuse to. The mini fig is standing but with these vehicles you can stand or sit. Also wanted to point out the little gray disk underneath so when but on a flat surface it looks like the front is coming up, like he is riding over a wave.

Overall its a sweet looking model that cries out to be played with. Also makes a good desktop figurine or a great addition to any town/ res-q collection. A solid 5/10 from me and if you can get hold of one please do.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

However the end result is awesome and this has got to be better than today's Lego jet-skis such as the Coast Guard ones. Even with such a small set, the playability is huge! I'd recommend you to get this set!

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-27T08:39:01.203Z","LEGO Town (Res-Q) - Res-Q Jet-Ski Review","This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set may doesn't have any play features but it's still very easy to maneuver. I really like the design for this little set and I also like the minifig we get in this set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun little set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J_tje","2010-03-26T05:59:30Z","Wave Rider to the Rescue","<p>This water/jetski set is, although small/simple (only 18 pcs), great. It's a good realistic model and comes with a minifig. It contains a quite unique (printed) yellow slope brick and has great playability (eventhough it does nothing). Nice little addition to the Res-Q series. </p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4
