Some homes might have pink as one of their colors and this set is a good example of that. First, I like the pool even though it is a hollow pool. The driveway is very cool and so is the car. The palm tree is a great part of this set and Lego should make more of them. The house looks pretty good for a minifig to live in. There is nothing wrong with this set and should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lovely colour contrast with the pink and grey and white bricks. The stone driveway and swimming pool are gorgeous and the car is a fun touch which makes the set more appealing to boys. The upper-floor windows are very dramatic and it's all in all a great set!</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4
"Wipipi","2018-05-19T22:38:17.03Z","A house for tasteful living","<p>This set truly is a gem. A nice 80&#39;s styled&nbsp;luxurious home&nbsp;with a black convertible car, butler, pool, parrot, and a great view<em>&nbsp;(assuming there are no dumps nearby)!&nbsp;</em>Let&#39;s get deeper into the set!</p>

<p><strong>The Car</strong></p>

<p>The convertible sports car is a nice addition to the set. Although many 90&#39;s sets had plenty of convertible cars, the addition of a car makes good sense for this set. This model of car is also featured in the McDonald&#39;s Lego set and others from the 90&#39;s. This brings a few questions into mind. What car brands are there in classic Lego? What brand produced this kind of car? What is the model&nbsp;called? All of these questions could&#39;ve been answered by the kid playing with their poolside paradise! Unfortunately, I purchased the&nbsp;set marked&nbsp;as complete,&nbsp;but there were some pieces missing from&nbsp;the car and the house. Thankfully I have replaced the car&#39;s chassis&nbsp;but I still need the wheels. Once I get those the baby will be ready to cruise!</p>

<p><strong>The Pool</strong></p>

<p>The pool is another great addition to this set. The kid(s) playing with this set can make it so the figures are swimming! In a Paradisa ad featuring this set, the pool is filled with real water, which would bring lots of fun to the kid(s) playing with it, but may give the parents a mess to clean up! If I were to have enough blue studs to fill the pool, I definitely would fill it up! Surrounding the pool, various details can be spotted, including;&nbsp;a nice palm tree, flowers, a diving board, a table with an umbrella, and a nice lounge&nbsp;chair.</p>

<p><strong>The House</strong></p>

<p>The house is quite the center of attention. It has a nice, sleek 80&#39;s design with plenty of white and pink. There&#39;s a place for the&nbsp;parrot included with the set to stay, a nice big kitchen (for Legoland standards), a basement concealed with a plate&nbsp;(I hid&nbsp;a skeleton under there), a nice pink staircase (One of the few multi-floored&nbsp;houses with stairs), and more! On the second floor, there is a relaxing room with massive windows. Next to that is a quaint little balcony with a flower pot on it. I&#39;d say the only thing missing from this house is a bedroom!</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this set is great for display, play, and collecting. It&#39;s a luxurious 80&#39;s styled beach-side home with a superb specialized baseplate which features a pool, raised ground, driveway, and more! The baseplate also features detailed&nbsp;printing, which is always welcome! My rating? 9/10!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
