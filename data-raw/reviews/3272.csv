"LegoFrancis","2008-02-13T12:14:41.733Z","Great Paradisa Set","This is my first review.
I think that this is a great set...It comes with a black horse, a kitten, a female rider with an equestrian helmet and a pony-tail wig, it also comes with a brown wip, a broom, two pink flowers, a podium with stickers, and two show jumps...

Pros

Black helmet
2 pink fences
kitten

Cons

None, except it could have one more show jump...

I sugest you to buy it in bricklink or Ebay.

Happy Jumping!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is built very quickly but it's also fun. We get one minifig which is the female rider. On the torso is a red jacket and the lady got white legs and the basic LEGO Town face.<br><br>This small set comes with lot's of stuff: two barriers, a black horse, a white cat, a podium and a place where you can support the horse. I like that green color on that piece where the barrel is attached to. In the barrel we get a brush, a broom, a shovel and a whip. And this small set also comes with pink flowers. I think this set is not only for male LEGO fans. It's a set which female LEGO builders will enjoy too.<br><br>All
in all this set is a grood model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
