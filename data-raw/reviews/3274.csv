<p>An awesome set, when we were younger it brought many hours of play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I give it an overall 5 rating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fits will with lego and the theme this set was in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience I give a 4 out of 5.&nbsp; Mainly because of the buildings and the parts used to make them.&nbsp; As a kid it was a bit tough to build because of some pieces I wasn't used to, but everything else was great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts is a 3, the only pieces that really stand out are the doors and the roof plates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability is awesome with you add other paradise sets or the smaller horse set with a trailer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't remember how much it was back in the day, so&nbsp;a 3 for value.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Horse trailer and jeep.</li>
<li>A horse for each minifig</li>
<li>A stall for each horse</li>
<li>A nice baselate with fences.</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Could have used more vegatation</li>
<li>Maybe some more minifig utensils</li>
<li>Maybe more yellow bricks as hay</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall if you have a little girl in your family that loves legos and horses, an excellent set!</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,3
