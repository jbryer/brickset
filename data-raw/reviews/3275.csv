<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I still have one of&nbsp;the white 1x2 bricks with the Shell logo sticker on it. Impressed it is still stuck on. The red hook arm has since broken, disappointlingly, but I ejoyed it when I was a kid.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not required for enjoyment.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Always fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I kid, I remember liking what&nbsp;understood to be&nbsp;the exhaust pipe on the rear of the car.</p>

<p>Maybe it took 1 minute.&nbsp;I think the red sports car refers to the cars of the 1930s. Or 1950s British&nbsp;sports coupes.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>It does not consist of many parts.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a big special part I&rsquo;ve always hated:&nbsp;big red crane / hook part.&nbsp;At least one hinge plate part would have been placed under.&nbsp;Then you can lower the nose of the car and lift it up.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately not included with the set.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The gaming experience is limited to rolling vehicles and towing a red car.&nbsp;I really miss a car mechanic figure from this set because that&rsquo;s how the set is so lifeless.&nbsp;Of course, this can be cheaper. In the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6000-1/LEGOLAND-Idea-Book"" target=""_blank"">6000 ideabook</a> is a simple but usable tow truck that can also be fitted with a minifug, and is made up of parts that existed in 1978.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>Simple, cheap, cute.&nbsp;There are a couple of alternative builds&nbsp;on the back of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Cons&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The vehicles were not sized for a minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>My Mod</strong></p>

<p>Now, not just to criticize, I made a tow truck out of parts that were available in 1978. Except for the hook, but it&rsquo;s irrelevant, the old kind is similar and has the same function.</p>

<p>I replaced the red 4x8 plate with a 4x10 plate. The 4x8 plate was too short for a minifig. I used the old style&nbsp;black hinge plate element for the crane.</p>

<p>For the winch, I used a white 1x2 technic brick, 4 stud long black axle and a gray connector into which a thin cord or thread could be threaded.&nbsp;Now I can lift with the crane, I can lift the car I want to tow, and I can put the minifigure in the truck.&nbsp;And I only used a few traditional bricks and plates.</p>
