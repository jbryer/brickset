There were two different packs, one of them contained a black go-cart with a blue man.(boxed) (I think some of the other four sets are missing on brickset))

I only got one copy of this set, but I want to buy at least 19 more.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-20T10:56:26.187Z","Your mail, sir!","This is one of Lego's finest impulse sets. For a measly RM 14.90 ($4) you get a nice bicycle (which aren't easy to get), a swing-down box with a Royal Legoland Mail logo on it (another rare item to find, even without the logo), and two letters. The bike also comes with a small basket that hangs at the back to hold the letters. The minifig is a postman which is a very nice thing to have in your town layout back then.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-12T10:30:01.297Z","LEGO Town (Postal) - Mail Carrier Review","<p>This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 12 pieces and it was 2 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 17 cents per piece which is a really good value for a set like this.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figure has a red overall, a red cap and white hair on the face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

We get a good looking bike and we also get a mailbox which you can open and we also get some mail which you can put into the mailbox.<br></span><span></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
