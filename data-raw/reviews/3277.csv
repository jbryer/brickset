They make a great addition to anyone's town layout. The clear blue panels that make up the phone booth even have the phone logo printed on it. The truck itself is the highly juniorized part of this set. It is missing a roof and built upon the 1 part chassis that I can't stand. This set does stand out above the other junior sets that I have. The minifig is hard to come across, I only have 1 and I have well over 300 minifigs. The bush and green plate are a great touch that let you expand on this idea. A great buy by even today's standards!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Finally, a telephone booth and a repairman with his truck. How cool is that? I agree with bmwlego for it being too juniorized, but hey it's a start. I wish they made more public works theme sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-03-08T01:30:01.41Z","Unique Idea, Not So Good Execution","I bought this set used from a bricklink store a couple years ago. The main reason of me buying it was because the theme is quite unique and different. I had too many police and firefighter sets, so this public work set was interesting for me.<br><br>I like the design of the public phone booth. Really cute and really adding something new to my city collection. The printed slope act as phone is cute too. And you get a lot of minifig tools in the set e.g. the spade, the screwdriver, etc. <br><br>But on the negative side, this set has too many flaws for me. The design of the truck just too bulky and too plain. It felt that Lego is really in a hurry for launching the set, so they just create a bulk box shaped truck, and no thinking of making it good looking.<br><br>So for conclusion, my suggestion is just avoid this set, unless you found it in a garage sale with very low price. It just doesn't worth buying.<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,2,3,2,3,2

<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 43 pieces and it was 8.75 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 20 cents per piece which is really high for a little set like this.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has only one minifig. The engineer has a gray suit and blue arms. He also has a blue cap and black shades on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-10T17:51:49.057Z","One of the few sets that's actually more fun for adults than kids.","<p>I remember as a kid having this set and having no idea what to do with it. It looked plenty cool, but it wound up just being a little scene in a corner of my town and never really being touched otherwise. There are a number of reasons for this that I&#39;ll get into. This set is divided into two parts so I&#39;ll review them each:</p>

<p><strong>The Van Model:</strong> Fits firmly in the &quot;not realistic but still pretty cool anyways&quot; category. We have, and I know this is shocking coming from a late nineties town set, a convertible telephone repair van. I really don&#39;t remember finding this odd when I was a kid but that was probably because I was a Lego obsessed kid in the late nineties... All the vehicles lacked roofs. Seriously probably 90 percent of my collection were cars like this so I just never thought anything of it. In fairness, it adds to playability due to the ease of removing the minifigure, but detracts big time from the realism. Now that I&#39;m old looking at it I find it very strange. How hard would it have been to add the maybe three bricks you&#39;d need to make this a van instead of a convertable? There&#39;s also no doors on the van, which also goes without saying considering the time period back when it was more notable when they did rather than didn&#39;t. The only other noteworthy part about the van is the large radar-like thing on the rollbar... I have no idea what this is supposed to be. Considering he appears to be fixing a landline, I don&#39;t know what good a satellite dish could do him, but there it is, sticking out like a sore thumb and making the vehicle weirdly tall.</p>

<p>The only other thing of note about this van is the red cabinet that fits perfectly in the back of it; it holds all the tools for our repairman friend which is always appriciated. One minor niggle about it is that the oil can (that probably could do to not be in the set at all... why would you have to oil a payphone?) doesn&#39;t really fit in the cabinet with all the other tools in it, it&#39;s too big. Oh well.</p>

<p><strong>The Phone Booth:</strong> I love this thing. It&#39;s a genuinely good looking model of a payphone, something that was beginning to be on the way out at the time this set came out and is all but extinct in 2017. The bush is a nice touch, and the barricade to indicate our guy there is working on it is also very cool and is a nice detail. The minifigure that comes with it looks appropriate, with that nineties &quot;sunglasses and smile&quot; head and an interesting looking printed torso. Say what you want about how sad the state of Lego affairs was back in &#39;97-&#39;99, but man did we rarely have to worry about stickers. Printed pieces for days.</p>

<p>The only complaint I have about the booth model is that it&#39;s on a plate instead of a baseplate. I always liked baseplates. Would have been neat to add another one to the collection... and to have it blend in with the baseplates around it more.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Nothing really noteworthy. It&#39;s a nineties vehicle, which is to say it&#39;s like twenty parts max and no advanced building techniques present. Building the phone booth however is fun and there are enough accessories that come with this set that you can make it look really cool and set up all sorts of scenes for this little corner of your town.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong> Whoa momma, is this set great for parts. The telephone repair parts are exclusives and good exclusives at that, all printed. The van side panels and the minifigure&#39;s shirt don&#39;t appear in any other sets at all. The stripey yellow brick, while not an exclusive, is plenty rare and nice to have. The telephone printed brick only appears in maybe ten sets, ever, and this is by far the cheapest of all of them. The red cabinet is in the &quot;not rare but you can never have too many of them&quot; category, as is the bush. But most importantly, the transparent phone booth panels. Man, do I wish TLC would have shoved more of these in other town sets, they look so cool, but alas, the two you get in this set are the only two you&#39;ll ever get, they never made another appearance, all the better reason to snatch this set up.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> This set has extremely low playability, sadly. One of the few, perhaps only, sets from the era that&#39;s honestly better for older collectors that wish to put them on display than a little kid that wants to play with a toy. There just really isn&#39;t anything you can *do* with this guy. He fixes the broken phone booth, then... what? He can&#39;t go fix another one, there are maybe four sets made ever that even have phone booths, and one is super rare and from the 80&#39;s, and one is Roadblock Runners, which wasn&#39;t exactly common and was very expensive for the time period. He can&#39;t go meet with his colleagues, as he&#39;s the only telephone repairman to ever be released by Lego. He can&#39;t go back to the phone company headquarters, as Lego never released such a thing and never even released any pieces that would aid in MOC-ing such a thing. All the pieces in this set are conducive to one thing: fixing this, and basically only this, broken phone booth. Once you&#39;ve done that thing, there just isn&#39;t much left to do with it as Lego never released even an ounce of infrastructure to make such a thing possible, which is a shame. A utility company Lego set? I&#39;d buy that.</p>

<p><strong>Value For The Money: </strong>I&#39;m rating this a three because this set tends to be on the expensive side. Back when it came out it wasn&#39;t and was perfectly worth it but since we can&#39;t travel backwards in time, we&#39;re stuck with what we&#39;re stuck with, and what we&#39;re stuck with is prices if you want to buy it in the USA of twenty to thirty bucks... I&#39;m not totally sure it&#39;s worth that much. It can be bought for much cheaper in, you guessed it, the Netherlands on Bricklink, but along with that comes massive shipping fees and quite a long wait for it to get to you. In other words, if you live somewhere that isn&#39;t the USA, pick it up, because it&#39;s probably for sale in your country cheaper than here for some reason.</p>

"JoystickJunkie","2020-03-17T03:21:59.92Z","Great for parts, poor for play","<p>I had this set as a kid, and as a kid I don&#39;t think I knew what to do with it.&nbsp; I put it all together and it didn&#39;t really prompt many stories or events in my Lego roleplay stories on my bedroom floor.&nbsp; However, years later, I think it&#39;s a cute little set that does have some merit to it, mainly in the form of the set being really great for parts.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The van uses a giant blue piece for the base of the car.&nbsp; Look at the picture again - everything from the tyres is one big piece, blue with the little poles to hold the tyres.&nbsp; Those new Juniors 4+ Star Wars sets from 2019/2020 with the massive grey piece for the A-Wing, that&#39;s very much like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the van is a convertible, which was great for me as a kid as I could put people in and out, and I guess I didn&#39;t really question it, but as an adult you look at this and go &quot;Well, why not just add a hinged roof like they did in the 80s?&quot;.&nbsp; Or even another plate or two so you can pull off the roof.&nbsp; Then again, the van doesn&#39;t have working doors on the sides and it only holds one person.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think any car I ever bought as a kid had working doors so this didn&#39;t stick out to me as a kid.</p>

<p>There is a nice little approximation of a payphone, which is nice to see and it&#39;s a shame Lego doesn&#39;t do payphones much any more.&nbsp; Everything in the set is printed nicely and the phone repair guy looks great.</p>

<p>You also get a little red and white cabinet with a full set of tools, which is really handy for play situations.</p>

<p><em>Overall</em></p>

<p>The building experience is simple and goes together quite fast.&nbsp; The payphone is a nice little model that could be picked up and put onto a new model elsewhere and the van can easily be used in a City display for adults, or in a kid&#39;s little town or city of course.&nbsp; The lack of a roof does make it easier for kids to play, and the tools are nice if fiddly at times.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind the little green thing it comes on, the plate, as it means you can attach it to part of a city display or a green baseplate and have it blend right in.&nbsp; Otherwise, I guess you&#39;d have to use your imagination to imagine a city or town around it.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set is superb for parts.&nbsp; Everything is printed, nothing is stickers and everything was printed really well as the parts I have from when I was a kid have not faded at all.&nbsp; The black sloped telephone piece is always great to have, and it wasn&#39;t in many sets at all when I think about it.&nbsp; The white side panels on the van with the telephone symbol are exclusive to this set, as is the minifigures torso with the phone repair stuff on it.</p>

<p>But the best parts?&nbsp; Those two dark trans-blue phone panels, printed with the phone symbols on it too.&nbsp; They are very very cool, and entirely exclusive to this set.&nbsp; They never appeared anywhere else and make for great pieces in a Futuron or space base (as a telephone station to call home maybe?).&nbsp; The red/white striped yellow 1x4 brick is hard to find too, and this is a cheap set to pick it up in.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>So as&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/profile/sparticusjoe"" rel=""author"">sparticusjoe</a>&nbsp;mentioned in his review, this set stands as a bit of an anomaly due to the&nbsp;situation it depicts and the fact Lego never depicted phone repair or telecommunications situations at all, before or after this set.&nbsp; This is the only telephone repairman Lego has ever released, although there are lots of other service workers he could go hang out with and with some imagination so you could PRETEND he has co-workers. But&nbsp;there are only three payphone sets, there is no telecom HQ or Service Centre, no pieces depicting the telephone logo.&nbsp; All those printed telephone pieces, the white panels with the logo, the repairman, etc, only appear in this set.&nbsp; So he&#39;s a loner, stuck to repair a single phone.</p>

<p>As a kid, I didn&#39;t know what to do with it because once you fix the phone...that&#39;s it.&nbsp; You could use the shovel to did up the phone, maybe take it away and get a new phone and then put the phone back. So your play options are limited with this set alone.&nbsp; But as always, Lego is a system, so I took the phone and the yellow/white barrier and put them to better use elsewhere in my play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>There are only two reasons to buy this set in my opinion:&nbsp; parts and making a diorama/City setup in your house (but for some reason wanted a period accurate City setup).&nbsp; The only reason to buy this set is the parts, particularly those printed dark trans-blue phone panels, the white Phone company panels and the red/white striped yellow 1x4.&nbsp; The minifigure is great if you can get it too.&nbsp; Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t really bother especially&nbsp; with the prices this set commands online.</p>
