"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-19T10:06:10.42Z","LEGO Town (City) - Mini Tow Truck Review","<p>This is a great little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 35 pieces and it was 5 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 14 cents per piece which is a good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The driver has a green overall, a white cap and a basic smiley face. It's a very nice minifig to have.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6423-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't have so many play features but it's still fun to maneuver with. The cockpit can be opened very easily and the crane on the back can be adjusted as well. There're also some tools on the back. It's a very nice addition for any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>Opened &amp; built it&nbsp;on the top of the steps at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Same as all from way back when.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Small number, not uncommon back then.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only 1, 1st i lost the cap, then i lost the figure which was a real shame,</p>

<p>1st figure ive ever lost (don&#39;t plan on losing ever again though).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple &amp; strait forward, just all of my other sets i got when i was that young.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great for whizzing around the floor, the back arm nicely designed</p>

<p>(not real world accurate at all). Good accessories, shame i lost the wrench!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Really nice set, only very simple, but quick&nbsp;&amp; easy to build + real fun to play with</p>

<p>(despite having lost a couple things).</p>
