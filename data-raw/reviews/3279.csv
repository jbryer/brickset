Hmm. My parents bought this set when I was 9 years old? Can't remember. Well, as you can see, it came with 2 cars. The best part of this set is not the cars. You can get cars from any other sets; but is the equipments like spanner and tools are all there, and u get the wheel thingy which i don't know what is it call.

Pros: 
No stickers (i hate stickers)
3 people
tools
2 cars

Cons:
the trafic light that doesn't look like a traffic light

overall, it was fun. 5/5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has 3 instructions and there're no mistakes in them as well.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 101 pieces and this model was 20 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio was 20 cents per piece. I think this set is 5 USD overpriced for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 3 minifigs. The first driver has a red overall, a red helmet and black shades on his face. The other driver has a blue overall and a blue helmet. The last figure we get here has a white vest, blue arms, black pants and black hair.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need any stickers to complain about.<br></p>

I believe it was a birthday present, so I can&#39;t comment on the price, but it was very fun to play with, and when I think about old lego&nbsp;sets I have, this one and the &quot;Y-Wing and Tie Fighter&quot; set are at the top of the list.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has some pretty cool parts in it, like the exhaust on the blue truck, and all the tools it comes with. It also had the blue car jack, which I thought (and still think) is awesome. Quite a few pieces have the octan logo on them which is cool as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures, a blue driver, red driver, and a flag guy. The drivers have octan logos on their torsos, and the flag guy has a white vest, with blue sleeves.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t remember much about the build, I think I was 4 at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks cool, and is very playable.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I still use the set (or parts of it) today in my city. The trucks have been converted in to regular pickups, and the tools and car jack are now part of my garage. Very cool and fun set.&nbsp;</p>

"sparticusjoe","2018-07-09T19:43:10.347Z","One of the best Town Jr. sets for fun factor alone.","<p>This is one of those sets that if you aim to model a Lego Town, as I have, you really don&#39;t need. If &quot;Rig Racing&quot; is a thing I&#39;ve yet to hear of it and know nothing about it and have never once seen such a thing in my life. That all being said, I love this set. It&#39;s a boatload of fun for a kid and the parts selection is just fantastic, especially for how common this set is to find. You probably don&#39;t need this set for your town, but you probably do need this set for the cool factor, I&#39;ll put it that way.</p>

<p><strong>THE RED TRUCK:</strong> This is the one I&#39;d always give to my brother when we played with this as a kid. It doesn&#39;t have the cool chrome smokestacks which was all I cared about. Looking at it now as an adult, it&#39;s a pretty neat design, all things considered. The six exhaust stacks in the back make it look tough and powerful and fast, and the generic Town Jr. truck front looks fine as well. The color scheme is nice, and the printed pieces look really cool. This is the Octan sponsored truck of the two, because of course Octan has to have their fingers in the Rig Racing pie. Interestingly according to the instruction manual the red truck is driven by the blue guy and vice versa. There are a ton of printed pieces on this simple design and if you&#39;re a little kid that likes cars and trucks you&#39;ll love it.</p>

<p><strong>THE BLUE TRUCK: </strong>This one was my favorite as a kid. It has two chrome smokestack bricks that look just awesome and give off an aura of this being a super fast modified semi truck. The &quot;Team 1 Racing 73&quot; printed bricks look sharp, the printed top roof brick looks neat and can be used to add some flare to a different MOC, and the windshield is that cool dark-blue color that you just don&#39;t see a lot, either nowadays or at the time. This one has a lot less going on than the other one (the chrome smokestacks make up for it in preteen me&#39;s mind), but it really isn&#39;t a worse model at all.</p>

<p><strong>THE EXTRAS:</strong> That&#39;s right, these four things warranted their own instruction book. Oh, Town Jr. and your love of adding extraneous instruction books, you crack me up. Well, you get a third minifigure, for one. This is really cool, Lego had a nasty habit during the late 90&#39;s of being sort of stingy on the little guys and having a spectator/referee/finish line dude included with this is a great touch. He&#39;s got the &quot;white vest with stripey undershirt&quot; torso that was all the rage in the late 90&#39;s and all but dead now, and he has a checkered flag to wave your little competetors to the finish line. You also get a... thing, with him. I have no idea what this gray piece is supposed to be. It&#39;s all of four parts, a trailer hitch, a trapezoid shaped gray brick, and a red and green cylinder. That&#39;s all it is. It looks like it&#39;s probably supposed to be the top of a larger assembly, like you&#39;re supposed to put it on supports to be a starting line sort of thing, but the set doesn&#39;t include anything like that so as-is it&#39;s just a stand for your stripey-shirted little friend to stand on when he waves the flag. Odd.</p>

<p>You also get a blue jack, which are ALWAYS welcome, as those pieces are super rare and extremely cool looking as well as functional. You get an Octan-branded barrel with a spout, which is also always appriciated to add to the collection, especially considering the top of the barrel has the Octan logo *printed* on it!</p>

<p>The fourth and final extra you get is a little mechanic&#39;s rack, which is another very welcome addition. You get a stand holding a spare tire, which is a super cool play feature for when you want your brother&#39;s racer&#39;s tire to pop, a little spedometer slope brick that is extremely rare, only being found in a handful of sets, and a pair of tool racks containing the standard motley assortment of tools you doubtlessly have an ocean of laying around at this point if you collect these old sets. All in all, considering TLC&#39;s general lack of inspiration during the Town Jr. era, having not one but four extra details they could&#39;ve easily left out adds fantastic value to this already good value set, and is appriciated at least by me.</p>

<p><strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE:</strong> You know, it&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s not great either... the chassis are pre-made as was standard at the time, and the roofs are all pre-made, and it&#39;s got the usual assortment of Town Jr. garbage that you&#39;re gonna get. But considering that EVERY set at the time was like that, it isn&#39;t awful. The two dramatically different designs of the two trucks goes a long way to making the build relatively good.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY:</strong> Very high. Again, no clue if Rig Racing is a thing, and if it is I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s popular enough to warrant a Lego set during TLC&#39;s stingiest era to date, but if you want something sort of offbeat while still remaining in the realm of realism to model for your Lego City, this set does just fine. A kid will love it... Super strong, fast trucks, what&#39;s better than that? And an adult like myself wanting to display the thing will find plenty of nice poses your little Lego men can get in that look attractive and interesting. As with virtually every aspect of this set, it&#39;s a lot better than you&#39;d think when you hear the pitch of &quot;It&#39;s Town Jr., but modelling something most people have never heard of&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>PARTS:</strong> FANTASTIC parts source, this one. I actually have two of these sets, one completed and one just for a parts source. Tons of printed bricks exclusive to this set, the always welcome and hard to find blue jack brick, a printed Octan barrel, the spedometer brick, a lot of tools, great torsos and helmets, the super rare checkered flag flat brick, loads of tires (always needed), chassis (always can be used for something else!), and cone bricks... This set has it all in terms of parts. And again, the chrome smokestacks are just so cool looking you&#39;ll want an extra pair for a dragster or something. Seriously one of the best parts packs for the price of the era.</p>

<p><strong>VALUE FOR MONEY:</strong> Well, fortunately this set was cheap when it came out and still is. It comes on sale on ebay and bricklink from time to time and usually for not super huge scalping prices. For twenty-ish bucks you really can&#39;t go wrong with this bad boy. Even if you don&#39;t like the base models, you can cannibalize it for spare parts super easily.</p>
