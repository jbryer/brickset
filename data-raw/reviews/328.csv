Firstly if you own 1693 you have this set just not the mini-fig, which is a shame as he is in the full white racing suit with the standard face. My real point out is the similarity to set 1631 released two years previously, again no mini fig. the front end is almost identical with same colour scheme same size even same pieces.

The thing that moves this one up in the world for me is the engine coming out of the back. Quite cool for an early model and really adds something different to the 1631 model. 

Again no real faults with this small model, some people might say its a re-release or a rip off of 1631 or 1693 but both were limited releases so all three are nice to have.

Overall im going to give this model a 7/10. the mini-fig helped knock up an extra point. Its a nice little racer and would fit in well with any collectors set. Especially if you like cars or racers. 

I would also like to say that in this review I was not comparing this model to the other two mentioned and if I sounded like I was I'm sorry. I only wished to make people aware of the similarities between the three.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
