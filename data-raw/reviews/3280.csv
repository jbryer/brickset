I prefer older Sets or the newer World City line to this Town jr. models. Altough there are some nice touches in the Helicopter. Like the TV Camera or the minifig.It's still too juniorized, but better then some other Town jr. sets.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T14:44:01Z","Good Helichopper for TV","This is a small helichopper. It is tiny, and the other blue TV helicopters were alot better. This one has the average fuselage part thats green, and sets the rad canopy too. The guy is kindof dopey and the set is all too juniorized, but any aircraft counts. I like the way the cameras and antennae are set up on its side. Freakin' easy to build but is cool if you want to make into somthing else.
I rate this a good 8. Cant really go too wrong. Chow.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Well this set is pretty much a horrible remake of the TV crew from 1997, without the Blue(green is a horrible color for a news station)

Minifg is ok i guess

2x10 stub is too juinorized for a copter.....try again lego

"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-22T08:18:32.853Z","One of the hidden gems of the Town Jr line!","<p>When it comes to Lego, I&#39;ve always appreciated simplicity.&nbsp; I&#39;m not really a fan of&nbsp;the complicated new models of today with lots of curves and overly complicated construction, and the new minifigure faces just look too detailed and fall into the &#39;uncanny valley&#39; for me.&nbsp; I always liked the simple blocky designs of the 1980&#39;s and 1990s, as they left room for a child&#39;s imagination and didn&#39;t clutter your eye with stuff.&nbsp; What we as adults bemoan as a lack of detail, children see as potential for improvement - whether that means attaching rockets to a dragon or wheels to a house.</p>

<p>I used to love looking at the Lego catalogues as a kid, lusting over the Space Port designs, wanting to own every Town and City set to make a massive city on my bedroom floor, and I distinctly remember seeing the bright green of this TV chopper.&nbsp; It really jumped out at me as different to the black police helicopter and the overly futuristic Res-Q helicopters.</p>

<p>I finally picked this set up for fairly cheap with an intent&nbsp;to use&nbsp;it for a vintage inspired Town/City setup, and thought I&#39;d give it a nice review in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>As a Town Jr set, this whole thing goes together quickly, and can be assembled in about a minute or two.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing super fiddly for a child, other than maybe attaching the camera and maybe getting the pilot in due to the limited space in the cockpit.&nbsp; But in under three minutes, you have a fully fledged helicopter&nbsp;ready to get some aerial footage.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I have to say, having only ever seen this set in a catalogue, I was both surprised and a little dismayed to find out how it was built.&nbsp; That green TV bit?&nbsp; I thought it was a 1x3 brick but it turns out the entire piece is like a giant green ring. It forms the bottom green bit below the trans-light blue canopy, wraps around and makes up the entire body of the helicopter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That makes it a bit hard to use it your own construction for say a TV studio or a TV van.&nbsp; You&#39;re stuck with a giant green ring and whatever you build would have to only be four studs wide (I suppose you could make a 4-stud wide car, as was the norm for Lego cars back then).&nbsp; The green TV piece&nbsp;is printed at least and one thing you could rely on Town Jr for was quality printed parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that, you get some small useful parts like a large grey brick, some helicopter landing skids, a rotor piece, a camera, etc.&nbsp; The canopy is always useful for stuff like robots, spaceships, the camera could always become a scanner, a laser gun, a VHS camera for a home movie set up - the pieces could be used for all kinds of things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure is nicely printed, with a microphone head detail to simulate a pilot&#39;s headset, and with just enough torso detail to make him look like a member of a TV crew.&nbsp; Then again, I don&#39;t know how many TV crews wear matching jumpsuits like they&#39;re members of Devo&nbsp;or something.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>I could see a child absolutely having some fun with this set.&nbsp; You can get the minifigure out, take the camera and go in for a scoop on a story.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could film an aerial shot for a movie in your own Lego city.&nbsp; Maybe you&#39;re tracking a criminal as they go on a car chase?&nbsp; Maybe you&#39;re travelling somewhere to shoot a documentary or expose on something happening far away?&nbsp; Or maybe you&#39;re just shooting the morning news?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that would have helped the playability is the addition of a storage compartment on the helicopter.&nbsp; I feel like that would have definitely helped, as you could have stored the pilot&#39;s helmet or something to take back with you.&nbsp; I also feel like the addition of an extra seat might have been something nice, but then the entire shape of the helicopter is thrown out - I don&#39;t know, I feel like a second minifigure space could have opened up so many story possibilities.</p>

<p>In terms of integrating with other sets like this, this is where it gets tricky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Up to this point, Lego had only released two minifigure scale TV crew vehicles - one in 1986 , one in 1989 - and both of them were TV film crew vans.&nbsp; I highly doubt a child in 1999 had access to either one of those sets, unless they had an older brother or sister or something like that.&nbsp; So you won&#39;t really have the ability to make a whole TV network with a van, helicopter and studio.&nbsp; And remember, that green piece is really large and bulky - you can&#39;t just pull it off easily and make a TV van or a TV studio logo on a wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s got more playability that a lot of the other Town Jr single vehicle sets.&nbsp; You can imagine it filming something or being commandeered by a crook, or your hero or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>For what you get, helicoper, minifigure and the camera accessory, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad price point.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty sure the TV helicopter piece only appeared in this set, so that&#39;s a plus for your money.&nbsp; The TV crew guy also only appeared in this set, so you&#39;d have to buy multiples of this set to start making a TV crew with matching red jumpsuits.</p>

<p>Now for whatever reason, this set usually goes for about $10 to $15 dollars used Australian on eBay, which isn&#39;t the worst price if it&#39;s in good condition but I still think that&#39;s a bit dear for what you get.&nbsp; If you&#39;re looking online, whether it be Bricklink or eBay, or you&#39;re building it from spares, I would say don&#39;t spend more than $15 dollars on this set.&nbsp; The parts to piece ratio just isn&#39;t worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Lego often just sticks to cops and robbers, firefighters, construction, the usual stuff that kids like.&nbsp; Kids like dump trucks and building stuff.&nbsp; They like catching the crook, putting out the fire and saving the day.&nbsp; But I feel like that leaves some much unexplored potential.&nbsp; Where&#39;s a Lego phone company? Or a TV studio?&nbsp; Or a grocery store, or an office block, a motel, a drive through restaurant?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Town Jr gets a lot of flak, and rightly so for about 80 percent of it.&nbsp; Town Jr represented a move away from brick built construction to lots of premade fabricated parts.&nbsp; But some of these Town Jr sets, in my opinion, are hidden little gems, that can absolutely liven up a city or bring a burst of retro flair to a town set-up.&nbsp; They fill the gaps between the cops and robbers, the firefighters and astronauts.&nbsp; Sure, this isn&#39;t a realistic looking helicopter - it&#39;s barely holding a single person and looks like it would be knocked out of the sky by a pack of highly distressed birds - but not everything has to look 100 percent realistic in my eyes.&nbsp; As long as you can look at it and go &quot;That&#39;s a helicopter&quot;, then I feel like you&#39;ve got something there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the adults here (which I feel like has to be the entire audience of this, I can&#39;t imagine there are many children on this website who also want&nbsp;a set from the late 1990&#39;s), I say to you that this is a little hidden gem. Lego hasn&#39;t made many sets about TV and TV crews, and this is to date the only TV chopper they&#39;ve made.&nbsp; If you need a helicopter for a city layout, are looking for a little Lego desk model, or simply want a bit of retro flair for your collection, I feel this one is a good little buy.</p>
