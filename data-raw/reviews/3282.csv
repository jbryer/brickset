The signs can be separated from the poles, so you can place the signs also on other things in your city. If you want to decorate your city or you want to make it more realistic, you have to buy this little set. If not: the fences can be placed everywhere, so they are not useless.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-24T12:03:34.06Z","Useful","You will need this set for your city. It comes with a 50 speed limit sign, a diagonal arrow sign (I think it indicates the stop line at an intersection), a do not enter sign, a traffic light up ahead sign, a pedestrain crossing sign, a stop sign, a yield sign, a turn right sign, a curve right, maximum speed is 30 sign, a narrowing road ahead sign, a park sign, and a bicycle path sign. It also comes with a fence with three arrow signs, a police stop with blue lights fence, and a construction zone with yellow lights fence. You can take the signs off their posts and put it on other things like a street light, traffic light etc. The fences are quite useful, but I suggest you buy many boxes of this set to obtain more signs and fences for your growing city. Overall great set, always can use as much as you need.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
