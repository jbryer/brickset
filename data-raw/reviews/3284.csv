It would be cooler if the boat was bigger so it could take more weight, as it sometimes can capsize. Overall a great set and it is something different to other fire city sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But, unlike many of the kits from that line, this isn’t as bad. True, the cockpit of the large boat is wide open and really silly, but with a bit of modifying it could be improved by a lot. Plus, the set as a whole has some neat parts like the red fins, the transparent slopes, and of course, the large boat base.

Of course, the figures are nothing special; just your run of the mill fireman and a gray-suited pilot. With all that said, I can’t really recommend this kit unless you are planning to modify it. I instead suggest you get the small World City fire boat released in 2004. Although I don’t actually own it, it looks far more realistic and sleeker than this one, and doesn’t seem to need any modifying. Still, this kit is hardly the worst of the City Center line, and not half bad overall. 6/10",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It's deffinately one of the oldest set in my possesion and nobody would disagree if I said that it came with awesome pieces. I like the fact that the main bit of the boat is made up of two pieces (One to make it float and another that goes over it to allow lego to be attached to it) because it allows so much creativity and customisation. I know so many people with this set and considering how old it is this is a classic and awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T02:52:36.967Z","Simple, Possibly Too Simple…","I only paid £3.00 for this set so I can’t really complain much about it; I do like the set in an odd sort of way.   It is pleasing to the eye and goes very well with other boat sets but I think Lego could have made it better.   I like the way that the Blaze Responder comes with a skiff, but where is the steering wheel for the skipper of the skiff?   The ‘outboard’ is the most unrealistic attempt I have ever seen made by Lego.   The cockpit is simple and serves it’s purpose as do the ‘water cannons’ on the forepeak and the twin whip antennae, the fins with the blue lights atop finish off the stern area well, but … how on earth is the skiff recovered from the water?   I can see that fast deployment is possible with the angle of the transom bracket, but how could it be recovered?   I have ‘toyed’ with the idea of including a crane or winch mechanism for more realistic recovery but I don’t think there is ample room behind the cockpit.   

So all in all this is a good set (it’s a boat!) but possibly a little too simple, but just use your imagination!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"sparticusjoe","2018-01-26T19:56:45.113Z","Town Jr. was a rough time for fire sets.","<p>So let me get this out of the way first: this is not the worst Town Jr. fire set. That title will always belong to the sad excuse for a Lego set known as &quot;6407: Fire Chief&quot;. That one is the laziest excuse for an impulse set you&#39;ll ever see. This set, however, is that tier of Lego set that&#39;s slightly above impulse: it&#39;s in the 10-15 dollar range and slightly bigger. It&#39;s also only marginally less lazy.</p>

<p>This sad little set models a fireboat and a, uh... fire dinghy? I don&#39;t know if that exists or not, but that&#39;s what you get here. I will admit that, living in the portion of Texas my whole life that&#39;s about as far away from the ocean as you can get, I know absolutely zero about actual, real life fireboats. I can&#39;t imagine they look this simplistic.</p>

<p><strong>The Fireboat:</strong> So, on the plus side, this thing actually does float. The chassis is just one massive prefabricated brick on top of a smooth, prefabricated thing made out of hollow, softer plastic than normal Lego. This is pretty neat, you can have fireboat vs. rubber duck adventures in your tub, I suppose. The downside however is that this fireboat inexplicably has two stickers on the sides of the floating piece, right at the water line. This is to say that if you build this set as you&#39;re supposed to, adding the stickers on the side, there is no way the stickers will survive to see your attempt at reviewing the model nearly 20 years after it came out as I am doing today. This is to say, I don&#39;t still have the stickers on it. Why they decided to add stickers to this set when I can count the number of Town Jr. sets that have stickers on one hand, I have no idea, especially given how inconsequential the stickers in this particular set actually are.</p>

<p>Other than that pretty big annoyance... There really isn&#39;t a whole lot to say about the design of this particular model. It&#39;s incredibly simplistic, even by Town Jr. standards. The whole set has fewer than 50 parts and it looks it. The boat is maybe three bricks tall, has no roof as most Town Jr. sets don&#39;t (though in this case I suppose it sort of makes sense not to), and most of the floor space is taken up by the massive dinghy transporting thing on the back of the boat. The space you transport the dingy is... you guessed it, a massive prefabricated piece, the type usually used for tow truck beds. A weird design flaw with this thing is that there&#39;s no obvious way for the dinghy (which, I should mention, does <em>not</em> float) to actually get back in the boat after its been launched. The boat&#39;s bed is too far above the water line. So it goes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a pair of slope pieces acting like a sorry excuse for a windshield (you guessed it, huge and prefabricated), and a pair of backwards yellow megaphone bricks that act as fire hose sprayers. They are doomed to constantly spray right in front of themselves, as the four seconds it would&#39;ve taken the designer of this set to add a hinge brick to them to let them squirt up or down was simply too much time. As is, they can spray in a straight line, side to side, and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p><strong>The Dinghy: </strong>Yes, this warranted its own instruction booklet for some reason, so I&#39;m reviewing it separately. This is the nautical equivalent of those sad eight-brick cars that they included with Super Rescue Complex or Octan Gas Station. It&#39;s a zero-effort job, the dingy itself is just one huge prefabricated piece (sensing a pattern here?) that has barely anything added to it. There&#39;s an attempt at an outboard motor on it that really doesn&#39;t look anything like an outboard motor at all, and a red panel tile brick in front of the intrepid firefighter... for some reason. No steering wheel. No controls. Nothing. Certainly no place for him to put his walkie talkie and axe when they&#39;re not in use, so they&#39;re just stuck in his hands forever for no reason.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>There are maybe, no joke, 20 parts in this set that aren&#39;t huge prefabricated parts. This is to say there is none. You put massive premade parts on a massive premade chassis thing that sort of floats but you shouldn&#39;t put stickers on it. The top brick doesn&#39;t even really stick all that well to the floating apparatus.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>I guess if you really want a bunch of parts you could use to make a fireboat with effort put into it, you could use some of these parts for that. That&#39;s about it. I don&#39;t think any parts that aren&#39;t the hull are exclusive in this set, and the hull really isn&#39;t that great. I&#39;ll give it a two because somebody out there can probably build a better boat with this as a starter set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>It&#39;s got it as most Lego sets do. The fact that it floats adds some points this category, the fact that the stickers fall off and that the dinghy doesn&#39;t float subtracts some. Right in the middle.</p>

<p>Far as displayability goes, pretty much nil. It&#39;s weirdly out of scale with almost everything else (it&#39;s about as big as some buildings) and it doesn&#39;t really fit in well with the rest of the 90&#39;s town line.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Higher than you&#39;d think mostly because this bad boy is cheap. It was hideously overpriced when it first came out, at a mere 13 bucks for fewer than 50 pieces, most of which are prefabricated and useless. Nowadays I&#39;ve seen it go for four to five bucks on ebay and not a ton more than that on bricklink. I get the impression there were quite a few of these made. If you need a hull, get it. If you need two firefighter minifigures, get it. But don&#39;t pay over ten dollars for it, it really isn&#39;t worth that.</p>

"JoystickJunkie","2020-06-04T08:23:23.347Z","Responding to this terrible blaze of a boat","<p>Lego has&nbsp;spent a long part of its life making trains, planes, and boats, everything from the famous Pirates line featuring the 6285 Black Seas Barracuda (which I spent months this year buying piece by piece to display) to the city based marina stuff like Police boats, cargo ships, the boats that were in the Divers line and more.&nbsp; So when Town Jr began to &quot;happen&quot;, when the town/city line was juniorised to make building easier for kids, Lego decided to release a boat for the line.&nbsp; Enter the 6429 Blaze Responder, with terrible fanfare.</p>

<p>Now I never owned this set as a kid, I only got it recently in a bulk lot.&nbsp; And I don&#39;t think this is the WORST Town Jr set, I think that goes to some single person cars like that Fire Chief&#39;s car or even some of those &quot;trucks&quot; with no roofs or ability to hold stuff.&nbsp; But it is a very disappointing build for an adult and probably the worst Town Jr set I own.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned in a previous Town Jr review, these sets were made for kids who wanted to jump right into building Lego.&nbsp; It&#39;s not for us, the adult collectors. So reviewing this set is a bit of a meaningless exercise but&nbsp;I&#39;ve already started so let&#39;s get into it.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, this boat can float!&nbsp; That red hull is all hollow and you attach a big white Lego piece on top to form a buildable surface.&nbsp; That&#39;s actually really cool, and if I had this as a kid I could certainly have seen myself taking into the bath for some fireboat&nbsp;adventures in the canyons of the bubble bath mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a &quot;fire boat&quot; in real life, so I don&#39;t know if this is accurate to any kind of real boat.&nbsp; I will say this:&nbsp; the building experience felt incredibly lacklustre.&nbsp; It&#39;s a Town Jr build, so&nbsp;we&#39;ve got simplified building with massive prefabricated parts.</p>

<p>The boat being an all-in-one&nbsp;part is probably great for kids and water play,&nbsp;but they really didn&#39;t attempt to add anything else here build wise as it&#39;s just bricks on top of bricks, with very little attempt at styling or creativity.&nbsp; The boat lacks a roof or cabin area, it lacks any storage or even a clip or two to hold some tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;The red slope at the front is prefabricated, the windshield is a giant piece which barely covers the captain and half of the Blaze Responder is taken up by this large tow truck piece in the back which is meant to hold the yellow dinghy you see in the picture.&nbsp; There&#39;s no printed console or a seat for the captain.&nbsp; There&#39;s no flags or horns, or radar dishes.&nbsp; There&#39;s no hook or winch to get the dinghy back up onto the main boat, nothing to really hold it in place except for a red hook which barely keeps it from rattling around.&nbsp; The dinghy can&#39;t even attach to the studs because of the shape of it.</p>

<p>I have to say, I don&#39;t know why there is a dinghy included here.&nbsp; The main Blaze Responder boat looks like a large speedboat, surely that boat would be easily capable of attending to fires?&nbsp; Maybe the dinghy can get closer?&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind the dinghy here, despite being all in one, and it does make it fairly useful as a raft.&nbsp; The outboard motor on the back looks really bad, just a brick and pole with a clip at the bottom.&nbsp; And there&#39;s no space to store the accessories on the dinghy?&nbsp; There&#39;s studs there on the side, they couldn&#39;t have put in a tile with a clip or two?&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing I need to point out is that the decal on the side of the boat, at the water line, is a sticker.&nbsp; I think that has to be the first time in my Town Jr reviewing/buying/playing days that I&#39;ve ever seen a sticker.&nbsp; Stickers often peel over time if heavily played with, and they especially don&#39;t like the presence of water given it interacts with the sticky bond.&nbsp; So why did Lego, in this galaxy brain move, put the stickers on the boat hull when they knew it was going to be going in the water?&nbsp; Surely you would just print the boat section with it?&nbsp; Or you would put it above the water line?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another odd thing is that the dinghy gets its OWN instruction manual.&nbsp; It&#39;s like five pieces.&nbsp; Surely that could have just been put at the front of the manual and put aside for later.</p>

<p><strong>Playability&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The boat floats, that&#39;s a plus.&nbsp; Being able to take this down to the beach, or into the bath or a large bucket is always good fun. I guess keeping the piece count low means less small pieces to lose in the bath.&nbsp; The&nbsp;water cannons&nbsp;on the front can turn, as they&#39;re mounted to a turntable, but they can&#39;t angle up or down.&nbsp; Apparently a hinge pieces is too complicated to have here.&nbsp; Failing that, there&#39;s just a lack of&nbsp;personality to this set.&nbsp; I look at this and I fail to think of stories or possibilities that arise.</p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t really work in a city display or layout, as it&#39;s kind of off-scale with other Lego stuff.&nbsp; That&#39;s a common thing across many of the Town Jr vehicles, they&#39;re all upsized for kids.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t look good on a desk.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had mine sitting on this desk here as I write and it doesn&#39;t look good, it looks blob like.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s no special or exclusive parts here at all, save for the hull.&nbsp; The hull is exclusive to this set, never came out anywhere else in any other colour.&nbsp; So&nbsp;you could use the boat hull and rework it into a much better, more competent boat.&nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t have to be a fire boat, it could be a small speedboat ala Miami Vice or a private pleasure craft or a fishing boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>I think the hull makes this a good value proposition as you could use it as a great base to build a better boat.&nbsp; The hull itself goes for about $1 to $5 dollars on Bricklink.&nbsp; As of June 2020, this set is currently going for around $8 Australian dollars on Bricklink.&nbsp; Ebay is a different story, with their &quot;retro markup&quot; so&nbsp;depending on where you are in the world, this set is somewhere around $20 to $70 dollars on eBay.&nbsp; Wow, imagine paying $70 dollars for this?&nbsp; I got this in a bulk lot for about $4 dollars, which I think makes this a decent price.</p>

<p>This is not a good boat, and it fails to excite the imagination.&nbsp; If you want to get this for the boat hull, get it. If you need some firefighters and some parts, maybe still get it?&nbsp; Otherwise, scrap the rest for your parts bin and keep the minifigures for your Town layout.&nbsp; Otherwise, just this one be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
