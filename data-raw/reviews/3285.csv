To make it worth having in a Legoland town, it requires at least an enlargement of the cabin, and the additions of real headlights.

Nonetheless, the model has its own good points. The construction doesn't use a car bed piece but instead several different flat pieces, and the bottom of the truck looks better that way. The flatbed is trivial but looks very good with the low fences as barriers. The color scheme is quite effective.

Two minifigs are included, sharing the same colors (not a bad choice, they actually look like they are working for the same transport company). As weird as it may sound, plain red shirts and blue caps are actually hard to find.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Xwing250","2008-12-02T12:18:36.59Z","Weird and Pointless","I cannot see the point of this set. I just cant. The minifigures dont fit in the cab and the so called &quot;Bars&quot; are pointless. The minifigures aren`t even simalar to their modern counterparts. The only use is for a miniland town. Pointless.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
