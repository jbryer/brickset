Anyways, the two blue lights on the light bar really did light up. I believe you have the option of them staying on or flashing. Not really all that amazing these days, but it was really neat 15 years or so when I got it. 

It also came with a standard lego mini-fig and if I remember correctly, standard lego police stuff (radio). It really is a pretty cool set, and if you see it cheap, I highly recommend picking it up",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"borg72","2008-08-30T20:30:55.95Z","Still as awesome as ever","Got this the other day from a well-known auction site (can i say ebay on here?).

having built it, i can say it is all kinds of win. a suped up high-speed persuit cruiser with flashing lights, a siren, and is solidly built with no discernable weak points to the build. brilliant.

my only (very nitpicky) gripe is that the massive 9v box takes up all of the room that could otherwise have been given to, say, prisoner storage, or police troop transport. as it is, he races to the incident with all sirens blazing, but all he can do once he gets there is put out two traffic cones and a diversion sign!

i do love the look of it though, plus the fact that its such a high-speed vehicle, the driver needs to wear a crash helmet!

i suppose a modern version would have more modern hinges and lightweight parts on the chunky rear tailgate section, to allow for slightly more space in there. but the existing arrangement is nice and solid.

i definate must-buy for police AND 9v fans!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the fact that it has flashing lights and looks like an armored car which makes this set even better. The stickers are a bit annoying, but it's always like that. If you are running low on a Lego police force, this set is perfect for that. 5 out of 5 for a great job on this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-19T04:58:24.497Z","""The Police Have Themselves An RV""","Here is another early 1990s futuristic design placed within the Town collection. Again Futuron seem to have gone back in time and given the local MFs some Space technology!<br><div>For four studs wide, this is a beast of vehicle. It will certainly please any who like Police and want a chunky, robust and large vehicle. It also features some special effects courtesy of a little battery power.<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div>Zipper topped with his cool visor helmet means driving this thing is no doubt a shaky ride for this cop.</div><div><br><div><b>Riot Control</b></div><div>What could Police need such a tank for? Controlling rioting crowds? Ramming open the bunker of wealthy criminal organisation? Traffic clearing? Snowploughing?! Leading an offensive strike in an opening land battle during civil war??!! Either way, its something of a monster and perhaps was made this large to justify the battery special effects box. A truck might have sufficed but ignore me, kids will still adore this model.</div><div><br></div><div>The excellent chunky wheel design was relatively new and has been around a long time. Rolling on six of these, the slanted brick, true-build wheel arches feature and support everything above with strength. A black line runs through this point with clips for gear on the sides, e.g the searchlight. Simple square headlights point outwards each end with extra yellows and reds laid flat for alert signals at the rear.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The rear gets a chunky hatch with hinge to construct at the back and lifts to reveal the light button (I think) and stowage for the wonderful sign and cones, always a bonus with a cop car or truck. This is a pleasing action without conventional doors. Here the access should be mentioned: its a 'beyond its time' cockpit one piece plexiglass windshield that contains the driver perfectly and gives 180º vision.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The big section in the middle is the battery box and holds Lego's secret to making light &amp; sound. I have no grasp of electrical circuitry and so great respect for the component. It has Police emblazoned across it in proper 1990's diagonal flash branding. Very good too. The light and sound element&nbsp;suggests an exciting feature...</div><div><br></div><div>The roof or top is made of a hinge for that cyber city cockpit, and a pair of ultra cool smooth blue light bulb covers. These look great when in use, especially in gloom. The rest is in black plate with a top of the range radio transmitter/receiver aerial designed to be lain flat or rise via the hinge brick. The black turn button for sound is here and while I can not remember the sounds quite, I thought there were two; one long and drawn out and the other more urgent in high siren wailing, excitement indeed!&nbsp;The back ends with an aerodynamic tail of sorts covering the lifting hatch.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Long Armour Of The Law</b></div><div>Could this make an early Space Police Prototype?&nbsp;Placing black at the front of the roof behind the windshield would have been consistent but is a nitpick, this is a model almost without flaw. So why mark it down so?&nbsp;Imagine it totally white with a Futuron Spaceman and robot and it would not be unsuitable, in fact more suitable for Space than Town? The very design is great but it is heavy, chunky and performs just a few tasks. Where big battery boxes are concerned, slightly less build options feature but as a Light &amp; Sound set, its really good. The issue raised is more to do with theme and setting, neither fitting or ideal but certainly fun and ultimately, that is what's important.</div></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,2
"James83","2012-12-09T11:22:34.32Z","High Speed Nocturnal Pursuit!","<p>Any set that had the Light and Sound system was cool, this looked cool and futuristic but wasn't totally practical for chasing those pesky robbers in Legotown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This six-wheelled vehicle looked the part and is similar to several other designs of the period with sloping wheel arches and fighter-canopy type cockpit driving positions. The design symbolises speed, but it was a weighty vehicle with the battery pack and couldn't free-wheel across the carpet very far and never seemed agile enough to catch up with sporty roadster the criminals often had. The driver has a nice grey seat and steering wheel. The central portion of the body is the battery with printed Police logos on the side - looks good but awkward if you want to use the battery box on a non-Police own creation. The rear storage area for two cones and a sign was well hidden and lifted up and had a high-roof. On the roof was a large radio antenna and a satelite dish for communications plus the siren and lights. The two hand-held torches clipped to the sides of the body seemed a bit odd on a high-speed chase vehicle&nbsp; and the lack of any cooling grills for the engine spoiled the realism a bit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>A standard Traffic Policeman with zipper overalls and a white helmet with blue visor. He had some torches and cones to play with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Own Developments</strong></p><p>This Police vehicle had a good life chasing cars but was never my favourite Police set. In hindsight it seems the Lego&nbsp;designers felt they just had to make a Police vehicle with the Light and Sound system and this was the compromise, an overly large and heavy vehicle due to the big box, that with the printed logos couldn't be used for much else unless you hid it. Even so, the thought of running around in the dark with the lights flashing as you chase the baddies is still cool and should appeal to the inner child of every Lego fan! Overall a useful addition, but perhaps not indispensible.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3
"Wipipi","2017-06-16T00:48:19.097Z","Catch Criminals in the Night!","<p>I just recently purchased this Lego Set and I am very happy with the results. This is a great Lego police set, with 2 different sounds and working lights that have different settings! If you find this and have some spare cash, you should buy it! Here is why.</p>

<p><b>-Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Light and sound!</li>
	<li>A ton of playability!</li>
	<li>Road signs to block traffic!</li>
	<li>Light up the night while chasing after people with crooked schemes!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Over the years, it is getting much harder to move the switch that changes the sound. This results in you taking it off by accident often times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this is an amazing Lego Set! This is probably one of my favorite Lego Police Sets ever! If I get the opportunity to purchase more, I most likely will. 10/10!</p>
