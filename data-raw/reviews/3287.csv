"Gus_263","2008-02-06T14:04:42.11Z","Rescue on road","This small set is really small, but good with playability and some pieces to build other cars. The car have doors that can open, to be easy to put the minifigure on. The wheel platform is a option yo build some cars, with a considerable size. It is really what i was needing. This is my unic Res-Q set, but i really like to mix all the lego system themes. Due to those facts, the Road Rescue i rate 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-09-03T10:52:08.89Z","My first set","Way back in the day for Christmas some year (maybe 1998) I still vividly remember getting this set. Obviously I was a bit young to handle the LEGO building portion myself, but it's what started an addiction that has lasted a LONG time. I played with that little minifigure so much the figure's legs would swing by themselves. Anyhow, memories aside, this is one of sets i would say to LEGO to keep on making. Since Res-Q is obviously a retired theme as is Xtreme Team and a lot of good other sets, this one stands out--little set, small build, big value. It's just one of those sets that I would buy again with any other LEGO purchase I would be making...c'mon LEGO! Reintroduce something like this! it would be a BIG hit...at least with this LEGO builder!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-27T08:46:34.37Z","LEGO Town (Res-Q) - Road Rescue Review","This is a great little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers in this set to worry about. The vehicle has a door on each side which can open and close very easily. This set also has some nice accessories, like a chain saw, a binoculars and a jackhammer. I like the design which LEGO has chosen for this model and I also like the minifig we get with this vehicle. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great little set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J_tje","2010-03-31T11:59:16.233Z","Nice and Simple","This is one of the smaller sets in the Res-Q series. It's just a car with some tools and a minifig, like many other small vehicle lego sets. Too bad it doesn't come with some scenery. (like a phone booth, plant,....) Nice printed slopebrick and handy tools. <br><br>A nice set, but if you are looking for a nice Res-Q vehicle I would put down the extra bucks for the 6445 Emergency Evac set from the same series.<br><br><br>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T12:29:40.793Z","Repairing A Road","<p>Set #6431 Road Rescue: I had this set for a while, but much like all of my older Town sets it is now residing in my Cousins place... Unless she lost it by now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Road Rescue is a small set from the Res-Q sub-theme. The model is a small off-road emergency truck and includes tools for helping people trapped after an earthquake or rockslide or any number of accidents. Accessory wise you are given a jackhammer, a portable hand-saw, binoculars and&nbsp;a pickaxe (Not to be confused with the Pirates Pickaxe, this one is much smaller and looks different.) all-in-all a very useful set of tools for assisting citizens of LEGO Town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set to any fans of LEGO Town, the set is a unique style of emergency rescue which allows for variety amongst the regular Police and Firefighting forces of LEGO Town/City and the Mini-Figure is a great addition to your LEGO Town populace.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"tadlos61","2017-12-14T17:19:32.45Z","Charming little set...","<p>I still remember running to the back of the toy store and grabbing this set, telling my mother this was the one I wanted (once a month or so she would take me to get a small Lego set).&nbsp; To this day I am glad my four year old self made that decision.&nbsp; I can remember spending countless hours playing with this rugged little truck, pretending it was off-roading as I drove it across the carpet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it is exactly, but this set just has a unique charm to it;&nbsp;it has a nice color scheme, nice size, and I just love those red and blue lights on top.&nbsp; I also love the minifigure, the detailed RES-Q torso is great, and one of the first double sided torsos I remember, it made these figures special.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Down to more technical details, I think you get a really nice bang for the buck here, with lots of playability for such a small set.&nbsp; The vehicle is the perfect size, with really nice details, such as the yellow accent color, amber headlights, red taillights, all built into the model.&nbsp; In the back is a space for storage carrying binoculars, a pic-ax, jackhammer, and circular saw, which immensely&nbsp;add to the playability of the set.&nbsp; On top of that are a few other nice pieces such as the printed slope used as the hood of the car and the trans blue windshield.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great little set, mine is still built&nbsp;to this day, and I plan on keeping it that way :)</p>
