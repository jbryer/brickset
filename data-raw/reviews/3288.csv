"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-21T05:37:35.79Z","LEGO Town (City) - Speedway Transport Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has 4 instructions: One is for the truck, one for the trailer, and the other 2 are for the race cars. All instructions have 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 134 pieces and it was 22 USD when it was on sale. That means that this model was 16 cents per piece which is a good value for this model.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 2 minifigs: The first figure has a blue overall, a blue cap and a basic smiley face. The other minifig has a white overall, a white helmet and blue shades on his face. The figures are really nice but I think LEGO could have included a 3rd minifig, because this set has 2 race cars and a truck.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6432-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set comes with 2 race cars, a truck and a trailer which you can remove from the truck very easily. The trailer also has 2 storage containers where you can store some tools and on the front of the trailer are some more tools. You can also adjust the ramp and the race cars can fit on the trailer very easily. The truck looks very nice as well. The ceiling can be removed very easily if you want to put the minifig into the cockpit. I also like the design which LEGO has chosen for the race cars.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
