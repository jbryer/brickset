It really is a busy set and can provide hours of fun for aspiring maritime police students!

The style reminds me of a somewhat futuristic attempt at police patrol boats and it was certainly ahead of its time when it was released in 1999.   The green ‘tinted’ windscreens and the dual control positions set off this boat well and the list of accessories goes on.   The provision of a boarding ladder is welcome, both for accessing the vessel when moored in a harbour where the quayside is not parallel with the boat, useful when the boat is at anchor or when intercepting other vessels and lastly, the ladder is useful when accessing the flying bridge.   The rear fins topped with lights and the red antennae set off the importance of the boat, but I wonder why the burgee mast is mounted on top of a support stanchion?   Surely this would have looked better if the mast had been mounted on a radar arch, possibly well aft.   The life rings are attached to lines secured to the forepeak, this makes casualty recovery easier.

All in all a great set with so much involved.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"phteven","2015-04-17T03:37:08.52Z","nostalgia trippin'","<p>This was one of my very first ever lego sets. I was 4 when it was released, and I think i got it for my 5th birthday. At a whopping 90 pieces this set took my dad and I the better part of an afternoon to build. Or maybe it was only 20 minutes, I was so young that my dad wouldn&#39;t let me build it myself, so he built it &quot;with&quot; me (He tried to build it while I took pieces and build random things). I remember bringing it in to the bath with me every single time. I&#39;d make little scenes with a minifigure&nbsp;drowning in the ocean and the police are trying to save him. Playing god is fun no matter what age.&nbsp;<br />

Besides nostalgia reasons, the set actually has some pretty unique pieces, like the green tinted windshields, the lifesavers, and the life jackets. The piece count here doesn&#39;t show every piece that the set comes with, but I believe it also comes with a yellow camera, although I could just have that from a different set.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend&nbsp;going out and spending money on it on an ebay bid or anything, unless you maybe had it, got rid of it, and are now regretting it,&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">or&nbsp;it was a set you really wanted at the time, and you can buy</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;now.&nbsp;</span>There are a lot better sets out there right now. The only cool thing is some of the elements, and the fact it floats. I like it because of nostalgic reasons, but if you never had the set, theres no reason you should feel nostalgia about it.&nbsp;</p>
