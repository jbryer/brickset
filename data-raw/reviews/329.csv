"Blade","2007-08-06T07:17:28.63Z","Scouter","I managed to pick this model up as a swap for a model i had doubles of. Got all the pieces and the instructions but unfortunately no bag.

Anyway down to the review. To me this is a cool little scout ship. It is what the title says a scout. Small, manoeuvrable, cute and cheap describe this model best. It's really one of the small ways LEGO expanded the set.

The colour scheme is typical Blacktron white and black. The mini-fig is white with black belt, arms and gloves. Obviously also has the Blacktron symbol on his body. Has the new style rounded helmet and an oxygen pack.

The only real flaws were the controls (kind of poor using a grill) and no defensive weapons for the ship or the fig.

Overall I really like this little model and for its size and price deserves a 6/10. Better than average but still just a cheapy. A nice addition to any space set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-07-06T13:38:39.75Z","Simple but cool","This set is one of the small sets released in 1992, and is a part of the Space theme, and &quot;Blacktron future generation&quot; subtheme. At the first view it looks like really incomplete (but this is a small set, so it is cheap and looks like incomplete), and of course, it is basic, but just due to it it isn't that bad.

The building is easy, of course (it is a small set), and the base is a black plate used in under the seat shaped piece. Some small plates with the common black color (among many themes from that times, the beggining of the 90's years) makes the connection to the wings, also black. The wings can move due to some pieces placed at the sides, that make it moves up and down. The semi triangular shape in each wing makes it looks like a bit more realistic than expected, and are really useful to any small spaceship. In each wing is located a small white piece with the blacktron subtheme symbol.

At the back, in the seat shaped piece, there is a white piece with the shape of a back of a missile. Useful to any space set (especially spaceships or also missiles), this piece is good, but it isn't very imaginative at all, due to the shape and size, it is actually big in comparison with some other pieces. But still with no much problems in the building.

At the front, a  piece connects two sticks used as controls to the pilot, and these are increased by a white small plate. It have no problem fo the pilot space in the cockpit (not exactly a cockpit because it have none parts above the pilot), but could be increased by another piece, to be a bit more cool.

The minifigure included is a common blacktron astronaut/pilot, very simple in the printed details, but very cool, like the oher classic astronauts from the old space subthemes. It is black and white, with few green details, and also, it have a helmet with a green (called as neon green sometimes, it was very common through space themes formerly, in the late 80's and all the 90's years) visor, and with a simple black jetpack.

The only problems with the building, not exactly problems, but parts that could be a bit better are the white missile part at the back and controls at the front. But, it still ver cool for a small set (the small sets don't have to be great because will be expensive and big, they must be small but at least good for a small, and this is an decent example). It gets a 4,7 of 5. If you buy it by at least the price of a &quot;impulse set&quot;, it can increase your space collection. Of course it isn't that much, is like a impulse set, but from one of the classic space subtheme.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-27T19:33:56.263Z","Well....it's small","This is one of smallest blacktron two sets, and it is a bit disapointing.

Pros: i like the engine on the back, and i like how the controls are held up.

Cons: too simple design....and barely a ship at all

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-16T13:11:15.857Z","The Blacktron strikes...","Ok, well, I got this with two other sets from 1994 at a yard sale for $1 USD each. It's pretty cool, though. We were also selling stuff there, so we had to sit at a table for 6 hours (With a 6-year old brother). It was entertaining, and would work awesome with a Space Police II set (Though I couldn't get one).

I give it a 3/5. Nothing special about this set, but it's still pretty good. Hope you can find it. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So either cheap or part of a Value Pack as it's numbering seems to be. Either case would have been part of an attempt at the time this set was released to pick up all the Lego sets out there available.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
