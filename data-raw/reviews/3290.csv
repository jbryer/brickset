"legoman4694","2008-06-19T21:59:01.013Z","my first big set","i got this set when i was 5 for my birthday. it is so fun. its got 3 cars 2 buildings and a little service ramp. the tow truck is probabilly the best vehicle. it autually works with the crank and the chain holds the car on. the figures are easy to put in on all the vehicles because the top gets removed very easily. the supply truck is also cool. its god 2 barracades, a spare tire, 2 cones (they may be hidden in the picture) and my first girl minifigure. the blue car is just the car to have service and ir goes well on the service ramp. the smaller building has some sort of a gas tank and some equipment there is another tire with a computer which i never got what it was. the last building is an office. its bviously the most complex and its the same basic structure as the other building. there is a trash can a computer and some tools. the manager and a cart is also good

its a great set and you will have hours of fun with it. the only thing i dont like is that there are 6 instruction booklets. most are the fold out ones. its a good starter set and defitnetly 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-13T07:30:41.347Z","LEGO Town (City) - Roadside Repair Review","This set is a very cool set to have and we get lot's of stuff like a car, a truck, a transport truck, a ramp and two buildings for the garage. This set is very simple to build and we get no stickers to worry about. The truck has some useful accessories and a trunk where you can store some stuff in the inside. The transport truck has a platform where you can put the car and we also got a chain and a string which can be attached to this vehicle. The first building just has a place where the engineers can repair the cars and the other building has a little office in the inside. It has great play features and it's a great addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>This set summarizes the reason why the lego company almost went broke in the late 90&#39;s..&nbsp;&nbsp; They have evolved much of their sets into a highly juniorized sets in a way reminder of duplo (but with smaller pieces) and where you didnt have to build a lot beacause you have&nbsp;larger pieces, headlights already drawn in the front car&nbsp; pieces.. (instead of being built), and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Must Adults fans of Lego didnt like this sets and kids were not engaged to this sets as they were in the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s, so their sales went south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So all in all this set is not a lego best example although it has a lot of playability since it has several vehicles and settings, buy it if you find it cheap somewhere, but if not, you will be better off with a newer set, or buy it just&nbsp;to have an example of the juniorized era.</p>
