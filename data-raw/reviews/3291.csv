We get lot's of stuff like a boat, a rubber boat, a jeep, a motorcycle, a helicopter and the headquarters. We also get a palm tree, a shark and a dolphin in this set. The rubber boat has an engine on the back but it doesn't have many play features. The jeep has a flag, an orange life-saver and a walkie-talkie on the back. The motorcycle also has a flag and a life-saver on the back and the helicopter has a life-saver on the side. The blades of the helicopter sviwel full 360Â° and the cockpit can be removed very easily. The boat which comes with this set is able to float on water and it also has a flag on the back which sviwels. There's also a life-saver on each side and the windscreen can be removed very easily. On the back you can also see a platform where you can put the rubber boat.<br><br>The main thing in this set is the headquarters. The gate of the garage opens and on the top you can also see a platform for the helicopter. There's also a place where you can store the camera and the stretcher. We also get a red and a green flag which you can put on a sign which shows you if you're allowed to swim there. The main building has an office in the inside with a screen, a seat and a nice looking aquarium which has a fish in the inside. The balcony on the top has a camera which sviwels, a yellow life jacket and a telescope which sviwels. This set is an easy build and we also get a few stickers which you have to put on the boat. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have!<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
