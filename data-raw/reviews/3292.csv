"Blade","2007-10-09T09:11:07.123Z","Little Speedy!","Well while sorting out the dregs of the box I came across this little mystery. I have this model but have two instruction books for it. One with catalogue number 6498 and one with 6436. I think I may have gotten this model first in a box from the shop and then got the second as a prize in a competition. Either way I have both and that's neat.

Well as you can see its a micro version of the original number one race car. Black with red and white makes a nice colour scheme and the twin exhaust looks good as well.

The driver is dressed in all white with logos on his racing jacket including the Octan logo so a sponsor or their racer I cant say. His visor is also that true deep blue which looks mad as with the white.

No complaints from me with this model, wheel size suits and the yellow steering wheel dose not affect the aesthetics at all.

Overall its a great little ripper and I'm glad I have two. For such a small model with very little parts id say this model pulls a 6/10 just for its shear brilliance and brings younger fans closer to the original racer. A must for any racing or town collection. Even good as a desk ornament :)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"andy87","2008-11-21T15:41:27.233Z","Nice set","I got this when it came out, i have a photo of myself building it. It was a neat little set for a good price, and one of my first legos that I ever bought. Its sad they don't make it anymore. It had great playability and i loved it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Logical_Thinking","2011-08-27T04:33:19.117Z","The set that started it all.","This was my very first LEGO set, so I probably like it a bit more than it deserves, but I digress. The build is that of your average go-kart style LEGO vehicle. It's all pretty basic, but I'd say that this is about as good as it gets for this type of chassis. The three stud slopes on the sides do a lot to make it look more sleek, and the white spoiler and yellow steering wheel help to make the color scheme interesting. The minifig is pretty nice also. I quite like the mustachioed sunglasses head, and the white racing suit works quite well against the vehicle's mainly black color scheme. Overall, this is a solid impulse set, but I wouldn't go rushing off to eBay or Bricklink to get it. Still, that having been said, I have to give it a 5/5 rating. As my first set, I cannot give it anything else.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 22 pieces. I don't know the price of this model when it was on sale but I think it's a good value if you want to get the minifig or the pieces for future MOC's and/or brickfilms.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The driver has a white overall, a white helmet, a translucent blue visor and on his face we can see blue shades.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6436-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do anything but it's still fun to maneuver with.
