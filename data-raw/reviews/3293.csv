This rocks! Beat that! You get a dude with a little cart! How awesome! Who likes junk to build like the stuff that I just named, or more of less, park and Service Tower!

If you wanted to use the front part on a baseplate you would have to build some framework for it. The chasse is useless for any other car (well any good looking stable car).

I bought this set at a yard sale (24 bucks for a college student's entire LEGO childhood collection). Unfortunately, he played with LEGO in the 90's when sets were juniorized, lacking detail and realism. It does come with a minifig and a printed wedge but these reasons are not enough to warrant a higher score than a 1 in my eyes. Kids in the 80's were spoiled with the great sets we had growing up. I might seem biased but just look at the sets that were in the 80's and compare them to something like this set and it is clear as day which sets look better.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"CrzyLCF","2009-09-29T19:20:58.013Z","A bit unrealistic, but decent","This is a pretty decent set for its size. The minifig is really well designed with black pants, a blue life jacket with a zipper in the middle, a life ring to the right of his jacket and his ID to the left which I thought was really well observed by LEGO. The minifig's head has a normal smile and a mustache above it and he also has sunglasses. He has a blue cap as well. There are only 2 accessories in the set, a life ring and binoculars!<br><br>The vehicle isn't that impressive because it is kind of unrealistic such as no engine, but it still has some flair such as the life ring and some type of code imprinted at the front of the engine if you want to call it an engine =P. The base of the car is one piece. It has a steering wheel inside and two lime green lights at the back. The blue flag is very random. Also at the back of the buggy there is a hook which you can attach the orange life ring. My only problem about this buggy is that it isn't realistic and it's not that durable. <br><br>Overall, despite some of the flaws of this set, it still is a really neat little beach buggy. 3/5 is fair enough for this set.",TRUE,3,3,2,4,5

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-10T07:31:57.74Z","Poorly designed, but it could be worse.","<p>Next up is 6437: Beach Buggy, a set I actually owned two of as a kid for some reason. This is a set firmly in the &quot;I immediately took it apart and revamped it into a MOC&quot; camp, due to a number of design flaws with the vehicle I&#39;ll get into. It&#39;s a shame too, what is here really could have been a great little set with a bit more work put into it.</p>

<p><strong>The Model/Building Experience: </strong>The big things I don&#39;t like about this set are twofold: 1) It&#39;s extremely back-heavy, and 2) the back isn&#39;t held on well at all.</p>

<p>Let me explain. The front twelve studs of this sixteen stud premade chassis it came on (it was 1999, premade chassis were all the rage, didn&#39;t you know?) are taken up by the huge, helicopter-like hood piece. The last whopping four are taken up by almost the entire piece count of the entire set. This is to say, that A) when you&#39;re playing with the thing it tends to do a wheelie when you don&#39;t mean for it to, because there is absolutely nothing on the front of the set, and B) that the two sloped bricks on the back only connect to the chassis at one single point each.</p>

<p>Lego tried to get around that by adding a red tile to attach the slopes with the 1x4 brick in front of them... Which does nothing to attach the back assembly with the massive grill brick in front, so instead of being held on by one stud the nearly entire set is held on by four, not a huge improvement. Adding two tiles to the sides to attach the 1x4 with the grill fixes the problem almost entirely (though it&#39;s still weirdly back heavy) but for some reason Lego didn&#39;t do that with the default set, which is too bad. As anyone with super old Lego sets knows, after the better part of twenty years they tend to get a little less brittle than when they were new and they don&#39;t hold on as well (which isn&#39;t to say they hold poorly, just that doing things like attaching heavy bricks to assemblies with one stud becomes a bit harder as they&#39;re looser) With good construction practices this isn&#39;t a problem; you simply re-enforce things and try not to have things attach by one stud and it&#39;s no issue at all. The two copies of this set I have that have been in storage for a long time both have this problem, which is to say the back end falls off very easily.</p>

<p>Other than that, though, the model&#39;s quite nice. The lights on the rollbar look nice, the life preserver mount is a great addition, and the flag adds a nice air of authenticity to the thing. just a shame that it stays together so poorly.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Pretty good show here, I will say. The life preserver pieces aren&#39;t easy to come by by any means and this is a cheap way to get them. The flag pieces that are just modified antennas are super rare, and the minifig&#39;s shirt looks great and isn&#39;t easy to find either. To the best of my knowledge the only exclusive is the weird front piece that honestly should be made of multiple pieces. I can say with confidence, as twelve year old me that had this set did it, that the front brick makes a fantastic helicopter nose if you so choose to make such a thing. It just doesn&#39;t look very &quot;beach buggy&quot; ish in my mind. I also live in western Texas around 700 miles from the nearest beach so I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Sadly poor, due to the aforementioned design flaw and back-heaviness of the piece. I can say however that if you take it apart and scavenge its parts you can make a really cool beach patrol/coast guard helicopter out of it with a ton of extra pieces. It isn&#39;t totally unplayable or anything, of course, as no Lego set is in creative enough hands. Just that as-is, out of the box, it isn&#39;t as good as it should be.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money: </strong>Why would you rate this so high, Sparticusjoe? You don&#39;t seem to like this set at all! I hear you asking. Well, the simple reason for the high marks in this category is just how little money this thing costs. It sold for a song when it was new and they must&#39;ve made a lot of them... Or nobody wants them... because they still sell for a song in 2017. It&#39;s not uncommon to see these things on bricklink for a buck fifty to two bucks, and any Legos you can get for that little money is a good enough value, particularly considering you get a neat minifigure, a life ring, and an exclusive front piece out of the deal. If this cost a nickle more than it does it wouldn&#39;t have much, but considering how cheap this is you might as well pick it up. After all, it&#39;s a Lego set. How bad can it be?</p>

"peti7788","2022-05-14T19:51:36.897Z","I was better, it got better later","<p><strong>Background story:</strong><em> </em></p>

<p><em>(If you are only interested in set, scroll down. I paste this for all set review made in this era.)</em></p>

<p>Late town sets (1997-2000) were made when Lego&rsquo;s finances and revenues were at a low.&nbsp;The company tried to survive by adding sets sold at previous prices but adding fewer building blocks, so the price / value ratio was very low. You only got a few bigger special items for your money. And on the Town theme, the age limit was lowered, (5) and younger kids really needed toys that were easier to build. But since no other sets were made in parallel for children aged 7-12, these sets of a few pieces replaced the previous more detailed sets. Fortunately, I escaped this bad period. Just then I was 10 years old and I was more interested in video games then. My childhood friends turned away from the lego, partly because of the video games, partly because of the crappy but expensive sets. As an adult, I bought a couple of used lego sets, and so I also had some set from this bad era.</p>

<p>Actually, for play&nbsp;value, these sets isn&rsquo;t bad, <strong>they just took the essence of the Lego. The building experience and the possibility of rebuilding.&nbsp;</strong>Previously, there was an alternative building option on the box, here it has been eliminated.&nbsp;They even saved on the cover image, so it had to be blended from less color.</p>

<p>According to the official justification, the company was so deep because they made too many different parts for the previous more detailed sets, which were rarely reused. (Space, Castle, Aquazone etc.)</p>

<p>But new parts had to be developed for these new sets as well, while existing traditional parts could have been solved without significant price increases.</p>

<p>Eventually, even though they lowered the age limit on the Town sets, they didn&rsquo;t buy much more for the kids. The release of Star Wars licensed products and the replacement of management saved the company from bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then in 2003 the theme returned as World City, and from 2005 it was simply called City.&nbsp;From then on, the vehicles (mainly trucks) became 6 studs wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Buggy</strong></p>

<p>The idea was good, especially since they used to add pickup trucks to the Coast Guard sets.&nbsp;Unfortunately, for the reasons mentioned above, the whole vehicle consists of 2 special elements and a couple of accessories.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t look like a buggy to me, more like an amphibian military vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>Cool guy,&nbsp;if there is trouble on the beach, he will help.</p>

<p><strong>My version for this set</strong></p>

<p>If the goal was to have a set of few parts and be simple, I would rather have built one from traditional elements.&nbsp;</p>
