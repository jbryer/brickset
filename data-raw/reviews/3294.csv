<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 30 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 10 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we got here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The construction worker has a blue overall, a red helmet and a beard on his face. It's a very nice minifig to have for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>

<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-13T17:11:18.173Z","A rare case where the remake is better than the original. This is the original.","<p>This set and the later 6470: &quot;Mini Dump Truck&quot; are just about the same thing. You can look at 6470 as a 2000-era remake of this set I&#39;m reviewing today. 6470 is a pretty charming and well done impulse set. 6439, however, is not.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>This thing is the epitome of 90&#39;s era Lego Town Jr. bad vehicle design. Take a chassis, slap a steering wheel on it (straight on it), add one detail (two if you&#39;re feeling generous), do absolutely not under any circumstances give the vehicle a roof, add a rollbar (can&#39;t forget the rollbar... even on vehicles like garbage trucks that don&#39;t have rollbars, add a rollbar anyways), and call it a day. There is just nothing to this thing. It doesn&#39;t really look like any construction vehicle known to man and it&#39;s a good question what it&#39;s even supposed to do. Lego sets don&#39;t necessarily have to be realistic, but it does help if they have at least a clear purpose to serve. I have no idea what this thing is. My best guess is a small vehicle to ferry around tools and gear to different parts of a bigger construction site. The title &quot;mini dumper&quot; doesn&#39;t really offer any clues as, well, the vehicle doesn&#39;t dump. It has what looks like a dump truck bed but it&#39;s completely static, stuck straight down to the chassis of the vehicle, never to move. No hinge, nothing.</p>

<p>The truck-object has a smokestack in the back... which is odd, considering it resembles a go-kart more than anything needing a smokestack, and because this is the 90&#39;s and a town set, no chair for the poor operator to sit on. There&#39;s also a small siren brick on the rollbar to alert people that a broken dump truck with no ability to dump is coming through.</p>

<p>The one thing I really do like about the model however is the warning barricade. It actually, surprisingly, looks really good. The signs are nice and detailed and the siren that sticks way up in the air to warn oncoming traffic is uncharacteristically realistic. Top marks for that thing. Too bad it&#39;s seven pieces and a detail that comes with every construction set.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong>: What building experience? It&#39;s eight bricks on a premade chassis. It doesn&#39;t get any more basic than this, folks. They couldn&#39;t even be bothered adding a hinge or a chair to the set. One out of five, there really isn&#39;t a building experience to speak of.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>It doesn&#39;t take much to get me to give a set high marks in this category. I am not giving this set high marks in this category. The rare bricks are basically just the two clip-on sign pieces... which admittedly ARE extremely useful if you&#39;re building a town plan, signs are a welcome addition to enhancing realism and making it look like an actual town. This set is a good source of two of them. Other than that, you get a broom and shovel brick, yet another premade chassis, all ready to be turned into a better vehicle, and the minifigure that you get identical copies of in other, better construction sets. There isn&#39;t much to write home about in the parts department of this set, which is sad, because usually that&#39;s the saving grace of even the most lazily designed sets. No exclusives to speak of to the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>The vehicle has no moving parts, you cannot actually dump anything out of the mini dump truck without making it do a reverse-wheelie, which looks ridiculous, and they gave you absolutely no bricks to function as a load to move around with this sad little set. Very, very low playability. Normally I&#39;d say that &quot;at least you can rebuild it to make a better/more realistic set using your own stash of bricks&quot; but that&#39;s not really the case here. You&#39;d just have to tear the whole thing apart and just build 6470 instead. 6470 isn&#39;t even the best Town set on earth but it&#39;s worlds better than this thing. Judging by the fact that I had to find all the pieces (which I amazingly still had) for this set jumbled among other pieces and not in a seperate baggie like most of the recovered childhood sets, I can assume that ten year old me didn&#39;t really think much of this thing either and just cannibalized the set as well.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>I&#39;m giving it a two simply by virtue that it barely costs any money. When it came out it was cheap, three dollars cheap, and it&#39;s maybe worth that for the sign bricks and the fact that it is scientifically proven to be impossible to have too many minifigures and smokestack bricks. Nowadays it goes for about five to six dollars which is a pretty bad value for what little you get here. It&#39;s an interesting curiosity item just to see how bad it got in the Town Jr. dark ages, and if you&#39;re a completionist of course you&#39;ll have to have it, but it really isn&#39;t worth anything more than five bucks and even that should give you pause.</p>

<p>Interestingly, even Lego seems to have realized that this set wasn&#39;t very good, because they released 6470 only a bit over a year later and this thing was forgotten, probably for good reason. So it goes.</p>
