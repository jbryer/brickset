"peti7788","2021-02-13T16:26:31.287Z","Motorcycle cop without partner","<p>The work of this cop can be lonely as he has to face the speeders alone.&nbsp;If he had a partner, he wouldn&#39;t go anywhere with him, since he wouldn&#39;t be able to use the patrol car.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig:</strong></p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a newborn at Lego, so there&rsquo;s no print on it, just a sticker.</p>

<p><strong>Police Car:</strong></p>

<p>The car looks like it came from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/354-1/Police-Heliport"" target=""_blank"">1972</a>. The only development on it is the fender piece.&nbsp;And of course the transparent blue cylinder piece.&nbsp;<em>It sounds arrogant now, but I can make a car from the same number of pieces that fits the minifigure.</em></p>

<p><strong>Motorbike:</strong></p>

<p>At least the minifigure can sit on it.&nbsp;But unfortunately the guy doesn&rsquo;t reach the handlebar. And he&#39;s sitting too high.&nbsp;And the motorcycle can easily tip over if someone is sitting on it. The designers didn&rsquo;t think much about this, not something realistic.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion:</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the flaws described above, I feel that this set&nbsp;may have been cheap, but very empty. Really misses another cop, a usable police car, and a couple traffic cone&nbsp;or traffic barricade.&nbsp;<em>But I might just think so because the highway police sets were later sold that way.</em></p>

<p><strong>My mod:</strong></p>

<p><em>The goal: higher play value,&nbsp;from parts available in 1978.</em> I fixed the seating position on the motorcycle so the guy could already reach the handlebars.&nbsp;I put an exhaust from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/605-1/Street-Crew"" target=""_blank"">605</a> set on it so the motorcycle wouldn&rsquo;t tip over anymore.&nbsp;Plus, the machine got a black 2x2x1 slope, representing&nbsp;a storage box for the motorcycle helmet.&nbsp;And the new police car is made up of exactly the same number of pieces as the original version. The traffic cones just extra.&nbsp;The police sticker and the other cop are from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/600-2/Police-Car"" target=""_blank"">600 set</a>.&nbsp;And the vehicle also got a steering wheel from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/621-1/Police-Car"" target=""_blank"">621 set</a>. <em>Now you can put the cop in the police car. Incredible! :)</em></p>
