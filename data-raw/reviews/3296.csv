It's fairly easy to build and once finished is very solid. It also come with two firefighter minifigs and their tools.

Highly playable!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AVCampos","2005-06-22T15:46:53Z","Fun, with lots of possibilities","I liked it much. Not only because it contained my first Light &amp; Sound system, but also because of the numerous &quot;truck&quot; pieces. Having each wheel on its own piece (as opposed to having a pair on the stuck on the same plate) easily allows wide vehicles to be built. Or, simply by removing the battery box and making some adaptations to the roof of the truck, a small car can fit inside.
All in all, a great, solid set, with a fancy A-Team-like swivelling front bumber!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
