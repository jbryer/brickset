This set, for example, contains an undersea base and submarine, as well as a surface vessel.  There are plenty of minifigs, a variety of sea animals and a wealth of useful pieces (including some I'd never seen before).  The base itself is a first-class design.  Its hinges allow it to open to reveal the control centre and storage for diving gear within.  If you crave more Aquazone sets then this could be for you.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T15:04:04Z","Love Divers..........","        The whole Divers theme rocks! I love scuba diving and submarines along with the Star Wars sets and airplanes. This set is really cool and isnt too futuristic at all! The Under Sea lab is awesome and has some good room inside. The bubble viewports are very neat and so is the little X-ray device. The dive gear is located inside the lab. The fisherman boat at topside is neat and I love the net which can capture sharks! The sea creatures rock but I wish that this thing would sink so that it could take place underwater in a bath tub or something! The red divers are cool and I just love the yellow submersible! It looks very real and has its own lab thing inside it! It comes with some good minifigs and a small bit of reef. I also like the small touches like the steering wheel, and other stuff! Again, it totally rocks at all times!!!

- A well designed boat with all the touches, winch, storage, antennae's, GPS Map and controls
- Five minifigs
- Submarine with room for two that opens up for easy access and arms to grab treasure
- Plenty of sea creatures including rays, octupus, sharks and the rare dolphin
- Undersea water scene with some coral and plant life
- And best of all an undersea research lab with microscope, x-ray machine, diving platform and a hinged design for easy acces and playability

I remember when I was younger this was the only set I took on a two week vacation and it occupied me the whole time because if has everything you need for fun adventures.

Only reason not to like this set is if you don't like water or undersea adventures otherwise I think it really is perfect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Fun to build, very clever use of unique bricks to make the underwater lab. You get tons of great pieces with this set. I have well over 200 different LEGO sets and this is definetly in my top 10 !! Need I say more?  AWESOME SET ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keexko","2009-04-18T13:13:58.36Z","My reward","I got this from my mom and dad as a reward for being an honor student in my grade school years! It was one of my favorite sets (as a kid) and I had a lot of fun with it! It is packed with a lot of minifigs, accessories, and sea creatures. It also serves a multi purpose because of the many things your minifigs can use. It's worth spending for!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2010-03-14T07:30:57.857Z","Better than the new Atlantis sets","<p>Despite getting only an incomplete second hand set, I am surprised by the rich content and attention to details in this set, I would say every&nbsp;element is great, from the lab, submarine, the boat to every single under water creatures, the color mix and parts are excellent, how nice if the new Atlantis set can come with such quality aside from having great minifigs/creatures such as the Squid warrior.</p>
<p><br/>The set is actually a complete eco-system, a few great things that I especially like to mention:</p>
<p>- The hinged plate design allowing opening and folding of the undersea lab to play and manage the interior, the doors on the ceiling can also be opened, and the porthole are very cool, making the interior lighting extremely realistic for an undersea feel.</p>
<p>- Even the small submarine has very good playability, equipped with the arms, it is very realistic as an undersea explorer that can collect specimens.</p>
<p>- The boat has a winch, and can be hooked to the base.</p>
<p>- The minifigs are well equipped, and the Underwater Scooter is also cool!</p>
<p>- Rich ocean floor creatures, how easy is it today to get a Lego Stingray?</p>
<p>- 2 Tan 16 X 32 plates!</p>

"Sebastian","2012-04-11T18:37:48.713Z","Detailled underwater laboratory","<p>Today I took this off the display shelf after quite a while and was reminded again&nbsp;how good it really&nbsp;is. The build is nice and it is&nbsp;great to see how the lab splits open. I especially like those cavernous windows and the air lock area from&nbsp;which the divers are supposed to get in the laboratory. The set has just so much to it and comes with a healthy array of accessories and sea animals. I also like the alternate models shown on the flap of the box. The only gripe I have with the Deep Sea Refuge is that it is somewhat hard to display the boat it comes with as it is logically&nbsp;supposed to swim ""above"" the lab.</p>
<p>When I first saw the&nbsp;laboratory after I&nbsp;had come out of my dark ages I was immediately reminded of Patrick Duffy, ""the Man from Atlantis"", a TV show that was highly popular when I was a kid and this really sparked my interest for the set. But even if you don't remember that series I highly recommend to buy this set even if you are not a fan of divers. It offers something for everyone and isn't all too expensive, even nowadays.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-29T09:47:26.043Z","LEGO Town (Divers) - Deep Sea Refuge Review","This set is a really fun set and it also has some cool play features. It's a great built and we also get a few stickers to worry about. This set comes with a boat, a sub, a base, two sharks, two manta rays, a dolphin and a squid. The boat has a crane which you can use to catch the fishes and in the inside of the of the ship where you can see the steering wheel is also a map. On the top of this cutter is a radar which can sviwel. The windscreen of the sub can be opened and the arms can be moved as well. The propeller and the headlights sviwel, too and the containers on each side can be opened.<br><br>The main model we get in this set is the base. The base can be opened and you can see a lab and a place where you can find the accessories for the divers. The big windows can be opened as well and the headlights on the top sviwel, too. I also like the plants which LEGO used in this set. It's a great set to play with and to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
