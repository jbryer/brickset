"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-14T21:43:58Z","Cool vehicles","Awesome set of underwater vehicles.  The back seat of the sub has a cool set of instruments for another guy.  So many possibilities - not just underwater.  Take the propeller off and it makes a cool-looking spaceship.  Also cool for playing a James Bond &quot;Thunderball&quot; scene.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jman","2007-03-24T21:25:27.247Z","A Very Complete Diver Set","Wow!!! This is a great medium size set with tons of playability and underwater adventures.

Pros
3 Minifigs (2 divers!!)
Cool sub with seats for two
Nice underwater scene with barrel, sword, and coral
Nice video camera sub thing
Minifig camera and spear gun

Cons
Maybe could use another animal besides sting ray

If you have lots of other diver theme sets this one might not be so exciting but it is so complete on it's own. A perfect 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-05-13T11:47:39.76Z","Cheapest way to get a large submarine.","The Sting Ray Explorer is the least expensive Divers set to contain a submarine of this size. The submarine contains a computer (With a fish on the screen) in back, as well as two neat grabber arms that can grasp onto things as minifigure hands do. The sub is the main attraction of this set, and it does not disappoint.

A small underwater scooter with a camera mounted on it is also included. It comes with two silver 2 x 2 x 2/3 round pieces used for the lights, a relatively uncommon element.

A small underwater scape is included with this set. There are 4 trans-green flame pieces used as seaweed, another uncommon element that is nice to get. There are also two arches here (Presumably a shipwreck), as well as a barrel with a cutlass in it.

Three red diver figures are included, one of which is a scientist. There is also a small black camera and a yellow speargun for the figures to use, and there is of course a stingray included in the set as well.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Sting Ray Explorer if you can find it for under 30$. Three figures and the large submarine make this set quite valuable.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

1 Sub

1 Sting Ray
3 Men
1 Scenery
A realy great set. I do love all the diver sets they are all great and i wish i owned more but i did not. I also had the one that came with a Diver, a Boat & a sword fish so together they went well. 
It would be great if it came with a treasure chest & a shark or something... But all in all a great set so if you get the chance... buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
