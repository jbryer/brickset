At the release it was a very reasonable price. These two good reviews dont do it enough justice. A+",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T21:55:04.25Z","I loved this set so much.","This is officially my all time favorite LEGO set. I got it when I was in 3rd grade, I believe age 7-8. It took a week to come in the mail and I was so happy when it came. I remember looking forward to it all the time at school that week.
