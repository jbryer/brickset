I just love them and the rest of the set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-08T02:55:44.09Z","Awesome Set - If you can get it, don't hesitate","This set is pure fun. The pizza delivery truck is cool, has 3 mini figs, oven, table to eat outside with umbrella. Four pizza's so you can make a few stops before returning to the Pizzeria. A must for anyone into Town or City.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legofan5445","2008-09-09T06:16:22.42Z","I'm hungry!! ","Great little set! Got this set from ebay some time ago and what a great little set it is! Every town needs a pizzeria! Nowadays TLG seems to move away from the classic restuarants and drive thru's such as this neat little set... Wonder if the minifigs from 2005 onwards dont go hungry??

Anyway prefectly cute little set! Buy it if u see it! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-25T20:59:13.983Z","Best set ever, period.","Yes, it does say this is the best set ever, and it's no joke. This set has amazing detail and a cool design. The van is even better with little racks for the pizzas! The chef even has a pizza paddle! oven also works for holding pizza. Plus, they throw in a customer with a table to eat at. So cool, I wish I hadn't torn it apart. If you do not own this get it. 12 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-17T15:23:16.623Z","My first set","This was my first lego set and its cool.  It got wrecked long ago but the pieces are very useful.  The pizzas are awesome and so is the car.  The building is good and I think it is a great addition to any collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-09T20:36:58.717Z","One of the Best Town Sets EVER MADE!","When Lego brought back the Pizza-to-Go set, they made a smart decision. This set is probably one of the best Lego town sets of all time and I own it. Starting with the building, it's a small restaurant or a big pizza stand which one you prefer. The pizza pieces are very cool and can be put into an oven which is even better. The sign is great and it's only one of very few times that the stickers looked perfect on a set. The umbrella is a nice feature too. Next, the pizza delivery van is a good car in minifig scale. I like the fact that pizzas can be stored in the back of the van and be delivered to hungry customers. I also think that there are no doors is actually a good thing because you can take the minifigure out nice and easily. Overall, this set is one of the best town sets ever made and is beyond a Lego Legend and is a must own for any Lego fan. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2009-07-03T17:03:17.81Z","Mambo Italiano","Two words. Great. Set. The pizza van, though small, is quite efficient and can carry four pizzas total. the outside of the pizzeria has a parasol, though no seat for customers. the inside has an oven for pizza storage, and a cup holder. As a tool to remove hot pizzas, lego has provided an oar! Strange, but efficient. a classic set, you can't live without it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The Town line alone that year included two other re-releases, namely 6636 Command Post Central (originally 1998) and 10037 Breezeway Caf&eacute; (originally 1990). Astonishingly, these three sets constitute the only substantive Town offerings of 2002, with the advent of the City line still three years away. While Lego at that time were descending from the peak of juniorization, they remained at the apex of the experimentation of the early &rsquo;00s. Thus Town was replaced by lines apparently closer to contemporaneous youth culture: Island Xtreme Stunts, Sports, Studios. The sensibility of 10036 relative to its loud, angular peers of 2002 could hardly offer a stronger contrast.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

These Town sets predate juniorization proper but I argue, in my review of 10159 City Airport, that in some of the modernist Town buildings of these years one can observe juniorization in its incipient phase.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

It is built around the central functional components of a pizza oven and an open-air counter; its short tower vaguely suggests Italian architecture, for instance the towers of Florence; its white, red, and green colors mirror those of the Italian flag. The absence of doors and windows is notable given that the prototypical juniorized building tends to be designed around its doors and windows. Constructing a building that looks like a pizzeria rather than a building that happens to contain a pizzeria eschews the standardizing impulse of the later &rsquo;90s. From this perspective, 10036 carries on the spirit of venerable town sets like the classic 1592 of 1980, with its faux-medievalisms.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

It includes five printed pizzas, which can be stored individually or in pairs on top of tiles in the oven and in the back of the van. Stickers are used for the signs on top of the building and on either side of the van, but the piece on the roof of the van is printed. Notable pieces include the printed umbrella, the white shutters that form the back of the van, a small faucet inside the pizzeria (not visible in images), and the light gray 8x16 baseplate itself. A paddle has been imaginatively repurposed to move pizzas in and out of the oven.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The van is nothing short of delightful, well-proportioned in itself and in relation to the minifigures. It sits on a 7x4 chassis, which would now be considered miniscule for a vehicle but which works well here. Its raised seat and the absence of doors accurately represent the design of a delivery van.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
