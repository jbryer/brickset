This is one of the best bagged sets I ever purchased and I am proud to say I own it.  I wish LEGO would make more sets like this...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-15T01:45:46.32Z","Not hidden treasure","Another nice set that seems to scream &quot;Buy me for parts!&quot;  However, it does have a few things going for it.  Firstly, the hand card is well designed, and asthetically, it looks interesting.  Secondly, the knight is actually very well armed with the weapons on the cart - a shield and a spear.  Overall, it's a good cheap set for obtaining large quantities of soldiers and treasure chests.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-01T19:20:37.903Z","Old cart","One of the older carts of the castle theme, including a minifigure of crusader, one with a good helmet, different in comparision with another like the bat-like of the fright knights. This set don't have a building, and isn't an army builder, but is small, have a minifigure and a cart with it's itens. The small sets are and were made to be that, small, if with more things, the costs are expensive. For one small set, is easy to play with due to the easy builting. Useful things are the flag, a sword, the treasure chest, don't hidden, but is easy to hide it in a bigger set, and the complete cart with the minifigure, that can hangs the shield, sword, or any weapons. This deserves a rate 5/5 in comparision with the other small sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Joe as a kid in the 80s. &nbsp;The biggest single reason for that was the annoying specialization that sapped the realism out of the idea. &nbsp;I didn't like that every single person in the two opposing ""armies"" was a single-purpose specialist. &nbsp;I knew that real armies ran on zillions of cannon-fodder grunts. &nbsp;What was always missing was battle packs of Vipers or Nameless G.I. Joes (as the term actually means).</p><p>Lego, however, had battle packs and little polybagged or small boxed sets like this one. &nbsp;They are so wonderfully useful to any Lego Army builder. &nbsp;You can have a whole bunch of armed and lightly armoured infantry or spear men. &nbsp;You've got pennants and treasure chests galore. &nbsp;You've got wheels and axles if you want to make larger wagons. &nbsp;It's a great parts pack.</p><p>What I always enjoyed about it most was the thoughts of supply lines that it instantly ignited in my mind. &nbsp;I saw long, winding snakes of these bringing treasures and other useful goods to the travelling army. &nbsp;These could easily supply the camp followers that grow behind any mobile force. &nbsp;Nobody, but me, thought G.I. Joe would benefit from such anonymous heroes. &nbsp;Thank goodness TLG offered sets like this for us.</p><p>Battle packs are coming back, and polybags are improving. &nbsp;We could see more of these kinds of things in the future, especially now that we kids of the 80s have more disposable income.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great parts pack with minifigure, sheild, sword, spear, wagon wheels, and a pennant.</li><li>Great in it's original purpose.</li><li>Could easily form the basic unit of a much-needed supply line for a seige or mobile army.</li><li>At an original MSRP of $2 USD ($3.50 CAD, I think it was...) they were a somewhat affordable way to plump out any army.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>My allowance was only $5 a week. &nbsp;That's more my parents' con than TLG's.</li></ul>
<p>We certainly need more battle/parts packs like this. &nbsp;This was one of the great ones.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
