I remember that putting it together was alotta fun!  I always have liked the Res-Q theme, it kinda equals the new Coast Watch theme but they have only made 3 sets for that one (I wish there were more)!  The res-q theme has the divers, boats, helichoppers, rafts, cool surviellance vehicles, hovercraft, control stations, motorboats, cool personnel, cool gear, cool cars and cool surprises that always had made me smile. This set is a small one yet a nice one. The doors are nice and the figure is cool  I like the stretcher and the trailer. It is a nice set and has some good gear and pieces!  I recommend this set for all at most every level of building!

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-09T10:18:12.67Z","LEGO Town (Res-Q) - Emergency Evac Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has lot's of good black and yellow pieces in it. They're really great to have - even for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with one minifig: He has the same torso which we've seen in each set of the LEGO Town (Res-Q) theme. The torso is double-printed as well. The figure also has a white helmet and black shades on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers in this set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6445-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has some good stuff in it. We get some nice accessories, a stretcher and a trailer which can be removed very easily. The trunk can be opened if you want to put the trailer in. The windscreen can open very nice and easy as well. Even if this set doesn't have many play features you can still maneuver it very easily, too. As I told you in the beginning: This is a fun set to have.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J_tje","2010-03-24T08:52:32.31Z","This set can rescue me anytime!","<p>This set is one of the best releases in the Res-Q series. It is small, yet loaded with tools, and extra's (like stretcher, rope and hook, little trailer),&nbsp;and very high playability. (The minifig can actually slide down the rope).</p>
<p>Some of the parts used are also quite rare and for it's price it's really worth the money.</p>

<p>A must have!</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,4,5
