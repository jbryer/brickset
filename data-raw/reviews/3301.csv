"Blade","2007-11-02T22:17:50.467Z","Should have been Junior LEGO","The first to review this set, but what a let down it is.I remember getting this set and being so disappointed with it. For the size and price you thought you were getting something good but no. The instructions have a whole three steps which should automatically tell you their is something wrong here. I know old school sets had smaller instructions but this is ridiculous. Consisting of a whole 26 pieces, once you take the wheels off and the mini-fig out you have a whole 14 pieces.

The model is mainly red and black, with a grill, hook, winch and flashing lights. The black under carriage is one solid piece, like something designed for a three year old. The cable and hook don't stay in place they just sit there and fall off quite easily. The only good thing about the whole design is it comes with a 1x2 with a rod on the side for clipping onto other vehicles so they have a tow point.

The mini-fig is strange too. He has the standard red construction overalls on but he has a symbol of a spanner on the front instead of the pocket and the graphic on his face seems slightly thicker than usual, making him look like a cheap imitation. Also has blue peak cap.

Overall this model was a real let down for me and it really reminds me of some cheap LEGO rip-off. Because the hook falls off so easily it gets annoying during play, but aesthetically it looks ok. I feel this model is about a 3/10, maily due to lck of pieces and playability. If you see it for like $1 at a garage sale get it, if not your not missing out on anything.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-26T12:08:28.89Z","Crane Truck Lacks Detail and Realism","It really seems like LEGO let us down in the 90's. I know the company wasn't doing that well and maybe it was because of sets like this. The wench and towing apparatus as well as the printed bricks and front grill are nice parts but this set is lacking in realism and detail. It is another example of a poor 90's LEGO juniorized set. I know that I have scored these sets poorly but I haven't done so without reason. When comparing this to the Super Tow Truck of the 80's #1572, I don't think a rational reviewer would rather have this set instead of the Super Tow Truck. This set is also built upon the 1 piece chassis that I really can't stand. The truck is also missing a roof, does it ever rain in LEGO JR. Land?",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 26 pieces. I don't know how much this model was when it was on sale but I think it's a good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The engineer comes with a red overall, a white shirt and a blue cap. On his face we can also see a brown hair. It's a very nice minifig to have.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.<br></p>

The only play feature we get is that you can pull the cable for the hook in and/or out. It's a good addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2013-12-28T14:23:27.237Z","Okay basic idea, but as one picture in the instructions reveals, incomplete","<p>This is set depicts a small pickup truck that's been converted to a 
towing rig (and had its roof removed, or maybe it was one of those off-roaders that never had a roof. I've seen them, so they do exist). It uses a 4x10 5-plate-high one-piece chassis compatible 
with both car wheels and wagon wheels. The cab is a simple affair of two 1x4 bricks with a wrench logo printed on them to signify that this is a mechanic's truck, a grill brick, a classic steering wheel, and a transparent teal 2x4x2 windshield. Right behind it is a winch-and-boom piece, threaded with a then string on the end of which hangs a hook of the variety with a 1x2 plate section. Covering the winch is a 2x4 plate capped with two transparent yellow (Actual yellow, not chartreuse) 1x2 slope bricks placed back-to-back to serve as the truck's lightbar. There's also a blue 1x2 plate-with-handle piece that mounts behind these when not in use. The purpose of this piece is to add a towing point to a vehicle that doesn't have one built in, which was very thoughtful. The mechanic minifigure included has the ""Red hair with wavy bangs"" face, red pants, a blue baseball cap, and a white torso with a variant of the standard ""overalls"" print: Instead of a front pocket, there's the same wrench logo to show affiliation with the truck.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Comes with a winch-and-boom piece that's useful for both this and other things (like building small trainyard or mine cranes)<br></li><li>Simple, but functional and rolls well.<br></li><li>Includes a 1x2 plate-with-handle piece to let the hook grab cars that don't have a suitable point built in<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This particular one-piece chassis has no seating recesses or other design points that make it something impossible to replicate (stably or even at all) with individual bricks and plates.<br></li><li>The cab design precludes having headlights. It could have had 1x3 printed bricks instead of 1x4s, leaving room for headlight bricks, or used a bracket mounted on top of two 1x2 plates instead of a grille brick.<br></li><li>The set is incomplete. As the cutaway picture in the instructions demonstrating the use of the plate-with-handle shows, there ought to be 2 non-printed 1x4 red bricks, one on either side of the boom, to represent the walls of the truck bed. But no such bricks are included in the set or mentioned by the rest of the instructions<br></li></ul>
<p>My conclusion? The basic design idea is okay, but the final design itself could have been better, and this set's rendition is incomplete. Not really worth going after. Better to get 6468 Tow-n-Go Value Pack, which includes the additional 1x4 bricks to complete the truck bed, a little go-cart to go with your other '90s racecars as well as its driver, and a better-looking mechanic minifig.<br></p>",TRUE,3,1,3,4,3
