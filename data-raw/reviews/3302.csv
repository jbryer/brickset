<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The construction worker has a blue overall, a red cap and a beard on his face. The driver has a blue overall as well, black shades and black hair.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>

<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-13T17:36:10.977Z","Whoever designed this thing was a Playmobil plant.","<p>I&#39;m of two minds about this thing. On one hand, it really is a pretty poor Lego set. On the other hand, I have fond memories of playing with this thing and really enjoying it as a child. It&#39;s one of those &quot;crap set but a kid probably won&#39;t care&quot; sets for me. If you have kids that are as obsessed with construction equipment as I was as a kid... They&#39;ll more than likely love this thing. It is, after all, a pretty good representation of a dump truck, which is all an 8-9 year old will care about. What it is not, however, is much of a Lego set, owing to the tragically low piece count, the fact that it basically comes out of the box built for you, and you can&#39;t turn it into a single other thing. I&#39;ll elaborate.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>Heavy machinery is cool. Some things are just facts, and that tends to be one of them for a certain type of person. Be it construction equipment, locomotives, steam engines, freighters, airplanes, mining equipment... Large, loud, smelly objects that do a rough, difficult, and dirty duty to keep the rest of society running as it should have always fascinated me and likely always will. Dump trucks fit into that category quite well. They&#39;re huge, loud, haul masses of stuff so massive it seems like it should be impossible, and (at least in the country, can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s different for all you city-slickers out there) you see them all the time. This made kid-me have to have this thing. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen before, and as I&#39;ve been over in past reviews, if it was something familiar to me I thought it&#39;d be amazingly cool to have it for my Lego town, as preteen me thought that lent my town some real-world credibility.</p>

<p>And I gotta say, this model of a dump truck (never heard one called a &quot;dumper&quot; before)... Actually does look like a dump truck. It has six wheels, a dump bed, an actual roof (an extreme rarity at the time... for some reason), and a pair of people to operate it. The dump bed actually dumps on a hinge. So... In this regard, the set is a success. It looks like what it&#39;s supposed to look like.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>This set, no joke, almost comes pre-assembled. The chassis is all one piece (and it&#39;s a big piece), the dump bed is the worst offender, being all one big pre-made piece that doesn&#39;t even really resemble Lego, the hinge the dump bed is on is one piece, the roof brick is, you guessed it, one big 4x4 piece... Which normally doesn&#39;t bother me, because normally there are other pieces with the set to add onto the handful of large pre-mades. There really practically speaking isn&#39;t with this set. The parts I just described make up probably 80 percent of the model. You get to build the back of the cab, put some pointless flat tiles on the hinge, and a siren on the roof. That&#39;s it. The rest of it is built for you. That... does not a satisfying building experience, or indeed any building experience, make.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>As described, there almost aren&#39;t any. Most of what you built consists of 1x4 yellow bricks, which are a dime a dozen to this day. The dump bed is certainly a rare part, but not really a good part as there&#39;s zippity-do-dah zero you can actually do with it outside of &quot;build a dump truck&quot;. The chassis is so large you can make either A) a out of scale large semi truck, or B) a dump truck, with it. The roof brick is pretty much a roof brick no matter how you slice it, can&#39;t be used for much else. The only bricks that come with this set that are remotely re-usable are the sloped siren pieces (yellow, somewhat of a rare color for them), the stripey 1x4 yellow brick (common in the 90&#39;s, all but extinct now), and the grill-brick (which is, as is par for the course at the time, pre-made and a printed piece).</p>

<p>The hinge brick it comes with is particularly interesting as it&#39;s the old-style &quot;studs all over the thing, no flat part at all&quot; type that was mostly seen in the 80&#39;s, and was rarely seen after this set. This is for a good reason, by the design of the thing the studs on the lower part of the hinge wear out super fast due to constantly clicking in place then removing themselves on the hinge any time you play with the thing. They really don&#39;t have any tension at all anymore 20 years later on my copy of the set... Not sure why they didn&#39;t just use a technic axle or a hinge brick to accomplish the same thing. Huh.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>If you&#39;re a kid, it&#39;s high, simply because it *does* look like a dump truck and has the feature of a dump truck. It also has two minifigures, which makes it that much more playable. If you&#39;re an adult wanting to display the thing, it still *does* look like a dump truck and resembles one when you put it on display. The problem comes in when that kid or adult wants to take it apart and make something else with it, the whole point of Lego in the first place. You&#39;re pretty much out of luck. This thing is a dump truck, will always be a dump truck, and you&#39;re just kind of stuck with that. Lego is about the only toy in the world that&#39;s actually a downside but that&#39;s what it is, it&#39;s so specialized it can&#39;t really do anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Not very good. It&#39;s sort of expensive and hard to find in 2017, and considering the pathetically low part count, that almost none of the parts are rare and what is rare isn&#39;t really useful, and that Lego has made a million better dump trucks since (most made out of actual Lego bricks that can be re-formed into other things, too!)... It&#39;s probably not worth spending the twelve-ish and up dollars it goes for. Recommended to completionists and truck-obsessed children only.</p>
