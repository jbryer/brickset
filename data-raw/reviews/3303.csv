"Eric_Botswana","2008-10-11T17:45:19.14Z","Cop Copter with cop copter pilot who is a cop","Nice, though slightly chunky helicopter, to my knowledge the first to contain a minifig. The major design flaw is getting the pilot out, quite often his legs would stay behind.

Plus, there's no controls for him to fly the chopper with, perhaps it's controlled through mind powers, but it didn't mention anything about that on the box.

Also, it doesn't hold together all that well. The back of the roof is basically holding that entire back section up (which makes it awkward when building it before you get to the roof stage). I've perhaps been too harsh on this.

One plus was the policeman was one of the first to not have a stickered shirt, but came with a zipper design printed on it. It also came with a flat clear piece (under the window), which are pretty hard to get.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The rotors are a great feature of this set. If Lego decides to make more police helicopters, they should look at this first.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is designed pretty sturdy, although I think they could have done a better (nicer looking) designing job with some simple parts from that era.<br><br>For example, red 1x1 brick should be transparent, landinggear could have been nicer, some controls for the pilot would be handy and the access for the minifig could have been better.<br><br>This all said I find it still a great model, and a must for all helicopter enthusiasts.<br>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,4
"peti7788","2020-10-13T21:00:27.42Z","Bricks and plates helicopter","<p>I bought this little set because it was the first minifig compatible helicopter in lego history.&nbsp;By the way, exactly this same helicopter can be found in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/588-1/Police-Headquarters"" target=""_blank"">588 Police Headquarters</a> set.</p>

<p>I think this is a blocky version of&nbsp;the <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Hughes500.g-bioa.arp.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Hughes&nbsp;MD 500 helicopter Model 369</a>.&nbsp;Obviously not as detailed because of the parts available at the time.&nbsp;The minifigure can be inserted from the side if you open the door or have to remove the roof.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>It is made up only of normal elements, plates and bricks. That&#39;s great! It can also be rebuilt from today&#39;s modern components. Except for non-technic standard propellers. There is 1 piece&nbsp;that is hard to find, the 2x4 transparent plate. No control sticks,&nbsp;did not exist yet. What I&rsquo;m missing from the design is the 1x1 cylinder piece for the engine detail. The tail rotor section very big and ugly. Not my favourite.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>Standard motorcycle cop suit, and old style helmet.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this cute set!&nbsp;<strong>The simplest things are the hardest to figure out. 1 extra point for the designer.</strong>&nbsp;<em>Too bad almost every lego helicopter today needs some big special piece. I miss the traditional lego design philosophy of being able to build anything from a few more bricks and plates.</em></p>

<h3>My rebuild</h3>

<p>The lack of engine detail and the big ugly rear end frustrated me. So I modified it a bit from the pieces available at the time. I put a 1x1 gray cylinder piece in a 1x2 white technic brick.&nbsp;In the middle, I replaced the many black plates with black arched bricks and two 1x1 bricks.</p>

<p>I placed the marker light under the tail in the middle of the plate.&nbsp;The vertical guide plane was too large, so now there is 1 black slope brick instead.</p>
