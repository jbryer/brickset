"Cornwell","2008-05-03T19:33:16.763Z","Light and sound madness","This kit was the only kit I ever owned with the Light and Sound system. It might have something to do with it always being used whenever there was anything involving the police ever since.

It was a simple kit, because the majority of the space available was used for the rather big and chunky Light and Sound unit/battery kit. Running of a 9V battery, it made for rather big kits all in all. Still, the creators had made sure there was a small area in the back where the two traffic signs could be tucked away. 

The brilliance of the kit was in the interchangeable filters of the lights though. With clear bulbs, it came with a multitude of little covering bulbs, which meant that you would always have the option of having the typical light-scheme for your national police force. The sound-making piece was unfortunately removable, and spent a lot of time being hidden whenever my parents felt a need for silence.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The reason should be plain to see; the battery compartment makes op the whole vehicle. It's a battery on wheels, really. The second building 'suggestion' is absolutely horrid.<br><br><b>Pros</b><br><br><ul><li>The lights &amp; sounds idea was good enough...</li></ul><br><b>Cons</b><br><br><ul><li>...but poorly executed here. Compare this to the space sets, or the rescue helicopter, and you see what I mean</li></ul><br><b>Displayability</b><br><br><ul><li>Not that bad. The tools and signs are decent, and as part of a city it's just another police van</li></ul><br><b>Minifigs</b><br><br><ul><li>Just a single copper.

"Funny_Bricks","2015-02-03T17:06:39.743Z","Really awesome! Even for MOCs...","<p>I bought this set at eBay for less than 15&euro; just to get this 9V system and I have to say this set is just really good!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I can&acute;t say much about this because I didn&acute;t got the box. But the instructions were pretty good and had some nice alternative builds at the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I think most people get/got this for the 9V system and I have to say that&acute;s completely worth it. The other parts are just regular ones and there&acute;s nothing special.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There&acute;s just one regular police guy but it looks kind of&nbsp;cute compared to todays ones :).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nothing special and goes really fast so there&acute;s not much to say about this.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks nice and the 9V system is very well built in to the whole thing. You also have some signs and fences to play with so you can build your own story.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think the set is a nice addition to every city and if you don&acute;t like the look you can take out the 9V system and electrify your MOCs.&nbsp;</p>
