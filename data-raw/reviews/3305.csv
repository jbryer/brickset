"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-16T00:26:18Z","fully equipped for res-q","3 figs, 3 vehicles, heaps of tools and heaps of pieces.

The design works well - car sits in the back of the boat and the rubber dingy sits on top. The twin hull has heaps of room for rescuers and the rescued. 

Stickers, I wish they would print them on the bricks, not too many though. Only stuck them on the sides of the boat and looks perfect.

Fits in with any town/train theme including world city rescue theme.

It was passed down to me by my cousins, thankfully entirely intact with insstructions and all, except without that cool winch. It looks and feels great, a fun and easy build with near-perfect design, as well as great tools and accessories. I love the way everything fits together, and the alternate models were great too. A definite 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vhtf_hw_lego","2007-05-06T23:49:30.733Z","Summaries For River Response.","My summaries for Lego System #6451 River Response.

Year Introduced: 1998.
Elements: &#177;145 Pieces. 
Minifig: 3 Res Q crew members.
Retail price was USD 20.00.
Weight for this item: &#177;300 grams.

Likes:
1st: +++++ 3 Minifigs acting as captain of the main boat, driver for the small vehicle &amp; diver.
2nd: +++++ Plenty of Held Hand Tools especially the diver's gear and overall suits the theme of the River Response.
3rd: ++++ The hull has a extreme nice angle. 
4th: +++ Matches perfectly to the name River Response as the overall is a rescue boat in Rivers.

Dislikes: 
1st: -- Wheels for the small vehicle could be a off roader tyre. 
2nd: -- No seat for the small vehicle. 
3rd: --- No &quot;hooks up&quot; for the diver's flippers. Can just added a plate 1x2 with handle (part #2540 peeron).
4th: ----- Captain's area. The Captain for the main boat cannot operates the boat if that the small vehicle is parked in the boat. I had moved the steering wheel and added a seat for the Captain at the front of the boat just opposite the winch. 
5th: --- If River Response is being set as a display, the 3 minifigs has no proper seats/area for them.

"GuitarGod_Dave","2008-01-01T09:43:05.53Z","Responds to any Situation!","This is a great set. Really a lot of stuff involved. I love the little car, and the extra dingy. I think the boat should have been a few centermeters longer to fit the car in. Over than that it is amazing. A lot of fun, good for rescuing mini figs. A great set for your town. I really like the Res-Q sets there really fun to play with. This is no exeption. 

A good looking boat, with 3 mini figs &amp; 3 vehicles. 1 is a diver, sea captain &amp; the over is a random driver. Get this set if you can. I know you wont regret it, it is very fun &amp; useful.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"J_tje","2010-03-28T03:17:07.45Z","Let's go to the rescue, but who's streering the boat (and how?)","<p>This set seems to be a small version of the Res-Q Hovercraft/Cruiser (6473). This RiverRespons set isn't a looker though. This boat comes with 3 minifig, a diny and a small car which both can be loaded/stored on the boat. <br />
<br />
I find the boats design not that good and highly illogical. Once you load the little, no purpose ugly car there is no way for the minifig to operate the boats rudder/steeringwheel. In my opinion they should have moved the steering to the front, since there seems to be a lot of space there and maybe include the jetski from set 1097/6415/6428 instead of the little car.<br />
<br />
The parts used are hardly &quot;special&quot; and not that many tools were included. (unlike the rest of the Res-Q) series.<br />
<br />
Overall a disappointing set.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-09T10:33:55.34Z","LEGO Town (Res-Q) - River Response Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there's one mistake at the end of the instruction when LEGO shows you the minifigures: The head piece and the hands of all 3 figures are wrong!<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some great pieces. We get a lot of black and yellow pieces. They're always great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>All of these figures we get with this set have the same torso but a different face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build s very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers with this set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6451-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p>This set has lot's of great stuff in it: We get a buggy, a motorboat and a ship. The ship has some nice accessories and a place where you can keep the motorboat and the car. If you want to put the car into the boat you have to sviwel the pieces which allows that the car won't fall out. The antenna on each side is adjustable as well. I haven't tried to test if this ship will float on water but I'm sure that it won't float.<br><span></span></p><p><br></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
