After all I have quite a few space sets (like this one) and it does go well with one. I agree though with :), as you can get the set and just fire the rocket. It is fun to make but a little boring to play with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-14T22:54:30.39Z","This little set is cool to mess with","The detail on this set is great. I love the blue glass with the rocket paths on it. You press your finger down to launch the mini rocket, it will take off across the table. Awesome attention to detail for such a small and inexpensive set. This set was a S&amp;H exclusive when it was available.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T21:22:41.577Z","Test Rocket","I have to agree with both reviewers on this set.  This is an awesome addition to the Space Shuttle collections.  It can go right next to the Shuttle Simulator and the Mini-Shuttle launcher.  Has another Engineer guy to add to the collection as well.  The blue glass is cool.  And when you &quot;fling&quot; the rocket, it truly does fly.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-23T08:46:05.45Z","Kaboom!","I got this set when the giant Lego truck visited my country in 2000. The minifig is awesome! It looks like one of those educated, intellectual professors.. with a lethal weapon in their arms. The rocket launcher isn't those handheld ones you see in television - it needs a launching station for it. The large blue clear piece is cool as the rocket trajectory patterns are printed on it, giving that scientific research lab look. The white slope piece has a sticker which seems to have data and instructions to operate the launcher. The rocket launcher actually shoots the rocket! It is really a simple see-saw mechanism. You just press down the other side of the see saw and the rocket goes up! I'd recommend this set to anyone who loves the Space theme from the Earth point of view. Alot of those cool lab-like pieces, a cool scientist, a yellow tube to boot, and also a very useful tan plate.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-30T09:17:41.347Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Mini Rocket Launcher Review","<p>This is a good set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 32 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio is 9 cents per piece which is a very good value for this little model.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figure has a white suit, a white helmet, black pants and a beard on his face. It's a very nice figure to have for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers with this model.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6452-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do much but it's still a very good set to play with. The only play feature which we get here is that you can launch the little rocket with a catapult. The design for this model looks very good and it's a very useful set for any LEGO space theme, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Stud_Sensei","2022-01-06T12:30:29.587Z","Failure to Launch","<p><em>6452 - Mini Rocket Launcher&nbsp;</em>only ended up in my collection as part of a job lot;&nbsp;if not for that, I could&#39;ve easily overlooked it entirely. Still, having liked the look of the <i>Space Port&nbsp;</i>theme beforehand, I wondered whether this little set might spur me into picking up a few of its larger range mates. As it turned out,&nbsp;<em>6452</em>&nbsp;is probably not the best first impression to take.</p>

<p>The main frustration lies in the fact that this set fails to deliver on its central gimmick.&nbsp;Despite multiple attempts, even swapping out parts to try and remove any unwanted friction, the rocket refused to jump more than perhaps an inch in the air, with most attempts causing it to just lazily fall out of its seat. Even the worst of the flick-fire launchers I&#39;ve had produced more dramatic effects than this, and it seems like something that certainly should&#39;ve been caught when it first stepped beyond the concept phase.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like there are any other redeeming qualities either. While the engineer fig is pretty nice, featuring a detailed lab coat piece and Steven Spielberg head, the rest of the pieces are nothing special, and the detail of the stickered&nbsp;elements is undercut by the fact that they are not printed (the design showing the vertical range of the rocket seems particularly optimistic...).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to complete a late 90s - early 00s collection, or just really like the <em>Space Port </em>theme, maybe it&#39;s worth you&#39;re picking&nbsp;<em>6452</em>&nbsp;up. It&#39;ll hardly set you back much, and would probably look pretty nice sat beside the other sets in the range. Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t bother; this set has more in common with a lame school science experiment than the missions to the stars it attempts to evoke.</p>
