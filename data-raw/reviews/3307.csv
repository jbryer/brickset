"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-18T11:35:44Z","Great Set!","I got mine complete with a bunch of other sets in a garage sale for free. You can't beat free! Anyways, it does come with great parts such as the trans-neon radar dish, the 1x2 Exploriens control tile, the 6x8x3 cockpit, the trans-blue 1x2x2 panel and the two 1x3 double inverted slopes on the bottom. The only problem I can find is that the 2x3 clip plate that holds the radar dish is too loose, so the dish flops around. Oh, and Chris Comlink is a cool minifig.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T17:24:44Z","Come get a piece of ti!","        This is a fun little set that almost anybody can make some fun out of. It is a small truck with some impressive gear on it. One, the sturdy wheels and the great mini-fig. I love the red spaceport employer suits. The truck has a steering wheel and a lever throttle thing. A real roomy cockpit has a huge sloped canopy. The back holds the real meshy stuff! One thing that srikes me bewildered is the awesome laptop computer. The main screen is a diagram that shows a satellites arc anf the other ones are a keyboard and some type of systems status thing. The other part is a satellite dish that has the interesting con of easily being chipped off. This is a good set and if you get a spacecraft that is REALISTIC than you can probably make a good space mission out of this baby. Damn!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"mrmitch","2007-06-14T22:50:49.467Z","Love the control board / computer - vehicle nice too","Nice set, I love the computer system at the side of the vehicle. Mini figure has head set to communicate with others at mission control. Affordable set $5.99 when released. Great to have to complete the Space Port collection. Recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Calanon","2008-01-30T04:45:46.42Z","just awsome","This is a great veicle for your space port, the driving area, the minifig, the computerm, the rader dish, jsut everything!
the only con is that the radar dish flops over a bit too much.


I got this at a supermarket before it was taken over by another supermarket company, and it was on shelf a few years after these sets stopped! I'm really happy that I have it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-22T14:34:42.077Z","Pretty good","This was the first space set I got. Here's my review:

Pros:

-Windscreen looks really cool
-There's a dashboard and transmission lever, not just the steering wheel
-There's a computer with a satellite, meteor, and earth on it, with their coordinates
-Huge satellite dish that can rotate and point upwards
-Comes with crew minifigure

Cons:

-Satellite dish falls off too easily, I had to use tape to fix it!

Overall good set but it's not that fun without any of the more bigger sets around like 6456.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-06T05:02:52.11Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Com-Link Cruiser Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 60 pieces and it was 6 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 10 cents per piece which is a really good value for a set like this.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has only one minifig. The driver has a red suit, a white cap and on his face we can see some glasses and a headset.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get some stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6453-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The design of this vehicle looks very nice and it's also very fun to maneuver it. The radar on the back can sviwel full 360Â° and you can also adjust that piece up and/or down. On the back is also a computer which can be opened and the windscreen can be opened as well. I really like this model - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J__B_","2010-07-10T09:09:50.723Z","Great!","The window is the main reason this set is awesome. For the occasional Star Wars MOC creator, it provided a cockpit piece that could be used on Star Wars ships, without having to buy a Star Wars set.<br><br>The computer and minifig are both great additions. The radar is good for parts, I guess.<br><br>No cons I can think of!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
