I have had it since it first came out and due to its quality, I picked up alot of other Space Port sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T21:45:43.873Z","Awesome Rocket","I actually got this set via bricklink so that I could have finished my collection of Launch Command and Space Port.  When I saw this set, I was thinking to myself of why does a rocket have a mini-fig if you cannot place the mini-fig inside the rocket...I was confused.  After I got the set, I realized that you can and I laughed.  The sound is great and so is the &quot;tip&quot; which becomes an independent satellite.  Plus, if you fix the middle section a little, it fits with the Space Port shuttle as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-31T16:53:11.233Z","pretty cool rocket!","i like this set, though it could have been a bit more detailed, i like how its three parts and you can take it apart. the noise and lights dont realy do anything for me, but they are pretty cool. the launch pad is realy cool, cuz when you take off, the things holding on automaticly come off. the astronaut can come out of the rocket through the side doors, and the stalight has very rare peices holding it together, which is a plus. i enjoyed plain with it when i was younger, and its still pretty good, but i dont think its all it could be

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-22T15:18:45.797Z","The most awesome rocket ever","Pros:

-Rocket is highly detailed
-Rocket has three sections
-Top section carries the satellite, can detach from the rest of the rocket as a small capsule
-Middle carries the cockpit for the astronaut. The side compartments open to access the inside
-Bottom section contains the engine and the light n' sound system
-Includes a launch pad with stabilizers
-Includes meteorite with emerald inside
-Includes astronaut

Cons:

-Light n' sound system requires batteries
-Cockpit has no controls

Overall great rocket and a nice addition to put alongside 6456.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-12T10:23:30.373Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Countdown Cruiser Review","<p>This is a very cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 20 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 133 pieces and it was 20 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 15 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we got here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The astronaut has a white overall, a white helmet, a golden visor and a headset on his face. It's a very cool minifig to have.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6454-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set comes with a very nice looking launch pad and a very cool looking rocket as well. We also get an asteroid which has a nice looking crystal piece in it which we've seen in the LEGO Power Miners and Rock Raiders theme a lot. The rocket has some wings on the top which can be adjusted. The stickers look very attractive, too. The back has an engine which you can light up if you push one of the 3 buttons. You will also hear 3 different noises. The cockpit in the middle can be opened as well. I really can't complain about this model.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
