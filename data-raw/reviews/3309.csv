"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-11T17:17:13Z","A set to be modified","I changed mine to be about three times the size, with a third level. (Astronauts lounge on second level!) The building here is way too open, with no access to the second floor. This could have been fixed with a simple ladder. A STUPID, SIMPLE LITTLE LADDER COULD HAVE FIXED THIS, A SIMPLE LADDER!!!!!!!! also, for the twenty five or thirty USD it cost, another astronaut or red technician could have been included. Pretty good, but needs improvement.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T21:55:39.937Z","Cool Addition","I actually do enjoy this set.  I don't know why the first reviewer is giving thumbs down to the tower because of it not having a ladder.  Do you see the Police Station or Fire Station with one?  Nope...none.  But I do like the set.  I enjoy the mini-shuttle, not only that it works as a flight simulator, but also because it works as a practice off-air simulator.  I like the Zero-G chair as well...spins nice, but it could have been a little nicer with an actually cockpit type chair rather then a simple chair though.  I still give it a 5 though because it is one of my favorite Launch Command/Space Port sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-07T23:13:16.763Z","I should keep the sets I like","I don't even remember when I got this set, but I knew I liked it tons. This set comes with a rocket, fuel tanks maitenence car, spinning device, launch pad, cool computers, tools, golden radar, control centre and tools. I like how you can crank the spinning device and make it go really fast. I also like how the launch pad tilts for take off. The radar is the best because when you shine a light on it, it gives a disco effect. Then this set got destroyed and stored away for countless years, with some pieces unused and some used.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-24T08:31:02.28Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Space Simulation Station Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has 4 instructions and there're no mistakes in any of them.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 245 pieces and it was 30 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio was 12 cents per piece which is a really good value for a set like this.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 3 minifigs. The engineer has a red overall, a red cap and glasses on his face. The other engineer has a white helmet, a white jacket, black pants and a breard on his face. The astronaut has a white overall, a white helmet and a shiny gold visor as well.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6455-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a lot of stuff in it. We get a jeep, a jet, a base and a centrifuge. The centrifuge sviwels full 360° and the ramp where you can put the jet on can be adjusted as well. The jet has a very nice design and I also like the engine on the back. The jeep has some nice headlights on the front which can be moved, too. The base itself has some tools, some canisters on the front, lanterns which can be adjusted and a very nice looking radar which can sviwel full 360°. You can also move the radar up and/or down. The inside of the office has some nice screens, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
