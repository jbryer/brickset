This set is small, don't see the point of the flag. If the person is looking out for enemies, why would he put up their flag? He might get blown up by someone because he is a pirate. oh, well... lego, great job!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a minifig, pistol, sword, flag, barrel and a few pieces to play with. It makes for a great impulse item. Or a small addition to a much larger collection for someone who like myself in the early days of the Pirate themes, was out to collect every set I could. I also much prefered this style of pirate minifig to the ones with a bandana and stripped shirt, mainly as I like the tricorn hats.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,5

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>A fun small set to quickly assemble. I don&#39;t know why you would rate this poor, I don&#39;t understand what other people expect for a small set that&#39;s cheap so for what you get the building experience was good and simple to follow.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some decent parts in this set, most notably a pirate figure, barrel, a cutlas, pistol, flag and some green vegetation. All together it makes this set feel like a small lookout...perhaps on a small island compared to overlooking a cliff. The lone pirate is told to watch the waters for any Imperial ships that might be out patrolling and alert his fellow pirates of imposing danger.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>I think what hurts this set the most is playability. Once built there isn&#39;t much you can do with it on its own but that&#39;s okay too. It looks good when paired up with other smaller sets. I know Lego can&#39;t make everything playable all the time, so I thought 3/5 was fair. As a kid I would have found some way to use my imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money:</strong></p>

<p>I think this is good value for your money for pieces and parts. It was a cheap way to get your hands on a barrel, a flag, some weapons and some green overgrowth.</p>
