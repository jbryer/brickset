MINI-FIGS:

9/10. I'm giving it this, because I think that the ground control guy shouldn't have a hardhat. I think the 2nd mechanic should. That way no flying space junk would hit him on the head, yo.

SPACESHIP:

12/10. I know that's not possible, but it rules so much it had to get that. 3 SEGMENTS! Superb.

SATTELIGHT:

9/10. Too small.

METIORITE:

10/10. Rare color of rock. Can also be used as Pluto.

MECHANIC'S CAR:

10/10. Couldn't of done a better job myself. It rules so hard.

ACSESSORIES:

10/10. Swell. Here are the (well-made) acsessories: 

1. Gas pump. 9/10. A little bit hard to put the hose on, but worth it.

2. Meteorite Examiner. 10/10. Great. has magnifying glass, which is nice.

3. World Map: 10/10. Sticker very detailed, very well made. Light cute too.

4. Control panel: 10/10. Great.

GROUND CONTROL BUILDING:

10/10. Cute. GREAT playability.

CRAWLER TRANSPORTER:

1,000/10. Again, I know it isn't possible, but it deserves it. Best part of the set.

PRICE:

9/10. A wee bit expensive, but worth it.              

LAUNCH TOWER:

10/10. WAY tall. Buy this set. Has lots of tools, and the fire extinguisher is da bomb, yo, homie.

PLAYABILITY:

20/11. Great fun. Litterally hours of fun. Swell.

P.S. I am NOT a hippie, I just like typing those little wierd words, yo.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-06T11:59:48Z","Great Set, Worth Buying"," This set is wonderful. The accessories, the three-part rocket, the space tower,everything.  The space tower is tall and I love tall.  The rocket is awesome and perfectly fits IN the launch tower!  How much better can it get?  Awesome set.  I love the minifigs included, and overall, you can play HOURS of fun with this set.  If you can get it, buy it.  I'm glad I did.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"nath8888","2009-02-06T18:06:30.187Z","amazing!!","This set probably wouldn't be my favorite set now, but at the time I bought it, it was amazing when I bought it.
Pros:
Rocket
Base to launch it
realistic track thingy
good minifigs
shiny crystal in grey rock 

Cons:
shuttle isn't as big as could be

Other than that, this set is top of my list, but not if your a serious builder.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JTR_11","2008-10-31T14:29:17.607Z","Love it!","Wow, i got this set a couple of years ago and i loved it then and i love it now. i only lke sets that are real (not sci-fi like life on mars and stuff)(exluding star wars, my biggest collection.) the shuttle is big andthe other sets that go with it are great. if u can get hold of it, buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-22T14:19:23.763Z","Simply amazing","What I like about this set is how there are a lot of details packed into such a confined space. Here's what I think:

Pros:

-Shuttle has realistic design and details like the fins, rudder, landing gear, and engine
-Cockpit is air sealed and has controls 
-Middle section can come off to form a smaller shuttle
-Satellite stored in middle section can extend outwards, but it's attached to the capsule
-Light n' sound system
-Launch tower has lots of details like the pivoting stabilizers (yellow hoses), weather vane, gas tank, catwalk, hammer, wrench, ratchet, screwdriver, gas tank, power drill, walkie talkie and fire extinguisher
-Launch tower has 3 floors
-Control building has cool windows, glass roof, golden dish and computers inside
-There is a world map and fire hose with computer on the grounds
-Shuttle transporter has caterpillar tracks, supports for the shuttle, controls, and a place for the minifigure to sit
-Includes a small car that carries a meteorite, there is an emerald in the meteorite
-There is one professor, two crew members and a female astronaut

Cons:

-Light n' sound system requires batteries
-Shuttle can only seat one person
-Control room is a bit small

Overall great set with high playability. They ought to re-release this set but it's a shame the space theme is now non-existent.
