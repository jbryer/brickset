"AddictedToStyrene","2007-09-26T08:02:17.437Z","An astronaut","Yep, an astronaut. That's what you get. No surprises. A minifig with a space-backpack. It's a bigger backpack than you would expect for a 'science fiction' themed space set, but since this little guy goes with the space port, the size is realistic. A couple of these can be happily added to a space station or space port set up. Comes with spare joystick and lights. The gold visor is cool too.",FALSE,3,5,4,5,5
"mrmitch","2008-02-10T01:41:55.06Z","LEGO shop at home exclusive !","This little guy was only available at LEGO stores or through the catalog for a short period of time. Cost was around $2.00 and he adds to the Space Port theme. Good set/good value to a cool theme. Recommend the man if you ever come across it today. Rate it a 4 due to the limited numbers of this set, good set to own as a collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There's a little golden grate on the back and a keyboard piece, very cool little additions.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pod120","2009-12-31T19:32:05.42Z","First set I ever got","This was what I believe the very first Lego set I ever got so I thought I better write a review for seeing it has been more than 10 years.

Pros:
-Includes many neat pieces for a set of its size
-Includes chrome gold face shield
-Box is almost a cube shape!
-NO STICKERS!

Cons:
-None",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-30T09:09:31.12Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Astronaut Figure Review","<p>This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and we get no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 18 pieces and it was 2 USD when it was on sale. That means that this model was 11 cents per piece which is a good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has only one minifig. The figure has a white suit, a white helmet, a golden visor and a headset on the face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6457-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a very cool minifig which has a jetpack. The jetpack may doesn't do anything but it's very easy to put it on the back of the helmet. This piece looks very good on this figure, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
