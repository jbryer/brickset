"Blade","2007-10-03T05:11:53.623Z","Deep Space Mr. Fix It","This model is awesome for so many reasons I'm having trouble finding the words. What LEGO city would be complete without a satellite and an astronaut to fix it? The shape is really well designed and looks quite authentic for a LEGO model. With moving reflective plates, a hinge up lid on the controls, moving tail and a big gold half sphere on the front just make this model cry out get me.

The mini- fig is a standard space man with full details on his jacket,has the big over size space pack with handles, gold reflective visor on the white helmet and a spanner for repairs.

The only fault I can find with this great model is the two wings needed stickers, which  I could accept as they may not look as good other wise but the computer screen didn't need one as well. Why must LEGO use stickers some of the time and print others? If it was all printed everyone would be much happier.

Overall the models playability is good and works in well with all standard space sets and most other space sets as well. The aesthetics are really good and works well in any collection I feel this little one is a 7/10 and would recommend it highly to all collectors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-10T01:47:07.92Z","Another set only available at Shop at Home or LEGO store","When I was collecting the Space Port theme, this set was in 2 catalogs as an exclusive. It was a bargin at $3.99 at the time. You get another needed astronaut and a cool satelite. The computer keyboard part is cool, however you had to put the reflective stickers on the &quot;wings&quot; of the satelite(not cool). Great addition to any Space Port collection - buy if you find it!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T22:39:48.81Z","Satellite and Astronaut","Pros:
Satellite
Astronaut
Astronaut's backpack (finally they used that particular pack back for the Space Shuttle sets.

Cons: honestly...there isn't any.  It is a simple set with no srings attached.  It may have been nice if the satellite could fit the long and large shuttle, but it don't matter...it could be one of those sets  where the shuttle brings the satellite by sections.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-05T10:43:51.703Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Satellite with Astronaut Review","<p>This is a nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 32 pieces and for my surprise it was 3 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 9 cents per piece which is a really good value for this little model.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The astronaut has a white uniform, a white helmet, a golden visor and a headset on his face. It's a really good figure to have for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get some stickers with this model. The stickers which you have to put on the wings look very attractive as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6458-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This is a really good looking set. We get an antenna on the back which can be adjusted and the wings on each side can be moved as well. You can also open the screen of the computer we get with this model. I also love the golden dome piece on the front of this satellite.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
