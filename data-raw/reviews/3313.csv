Overall it is a great set and fun to build.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>We get 2 instructions with this model. One is for the motorcycle and the gas station which has only two pages and the other one is for the truck which has 12 pages. There're no mistakes in any instruction as well.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 112 pieces and it was 15 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 13 cents per piece which is a really good price for a set like this.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has two minifigs. The truck driver has a red uniform, a red cap and on his face we can see some glasses and a headset. The motorcycle driver has a white helmet, a white oxygen tank, a gray mask and a beard on his face. He also has a gray uniform.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6459-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a lot of stuff in it: We get a motorcycle, a gas station and a truck. The truck has a hose on the back which you can pull out of that vehicle and you can also put it in there very nice and easy. The cockpit can be opened very easily, too. It's a really good set to add into any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
