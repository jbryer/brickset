It uses the traditional car design pieces, the single bed piece (red is extremely rare), windshield, doors, wheels and mudguards. It is not quite there however, since it doesn't have headlights yet.

An odd design choice is the lack of roof, an service car is supposed to be used in any kind of weather.

The nicest bit is certainly the back door, which is in fact a house window with red shutters.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
