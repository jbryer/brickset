"Moscadini","2007-10-19T16:28:25.247Z","For Space Port Security","I think this is one of the best and yet simplest helicopter sets ever.  I was happy to see it on Bricklink, so I had to buy it so that my Space Port Collection was complete.  Too bad it was not sold here in the USA.

The mini-figs outfit is perfect &amp; awesome too...no words to be added.

I think the one Con that it has...like Launch Command had, it had a truck as well.  This one doesn't.

But it don't matter, because the uniqueness is that counts",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"kfr","2014-02-20T10:45:09.357Z","Ok to complete the collection, otherwise look somewhere else","<p>This must be the ugliest Lego helicopter I&#39;ve seen. Not that I&#39;ve seen all of them of course, but the actual model looks much less interesting than the (box) photograph may imply.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve bought this used without the box. The instructions are easy to follow and well readable; no issues here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The landing gear comes in one piece. The main body of the helicopter also comes in one piece. This leaves you with 28 pieces to actually do something in terms of build (see below), none of which are particularly special. The rotors (main and back) are similar to/the same as for other helicopter models.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The pilot is quite cool, actually. The minifigure has a moustache and&nbsp;&#39;wears&#39; a pilot uniform as well as a helmet with visor.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite boring. You mainly stick the parts on top of each other. It&#39;s very easy, but also not very interesting.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like that the helicopter uses antennas for the steering. The camera at the side is also quite nice (even though for some reason the designers decided to use a white handle to hold a gray camera on gray landing gear). The rotors rotate (as the name implies), so I guess playability isn&#39;t too bad actually. It&#39;s just that I believe overall the model is too boxy and flimsy in its looks (not in its build, it&#39;s quite stable).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I bought this to continue my Space Port collection. In its own right I wouldn&#39;t recommend this model. There are way more interesting helicopters to get.</p>
