Although the propeller couldn't lift a fly, the play value in this is neverending.  Res-q was a great theme (despite its use of txt in the title).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T04:23:34Z","Brilliant","I got this as a christmas preasant in the year of 1999. It was fun to build and it took me ages. (I was only nine years old. it fell apart once and the rope got caught on something sharp and over time the rope wore out and snaped. It took me some years (2) before I got a new rope and rebuilt the broken perices. Now back in one piece, it is a glorious set and one of my all round favourites out of my city lego.
Pluses:
* Cool chopper
* Cool theme
Minuses:

Great set It is wicked and it is a great build.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"GuitarGod_Dave","2008-12-31T09:20:31.077Z","What a helicopter","I definatly did love all the RES Q stuff & this is no exeption. It is a real big helicopter with extras. Can it get better?
1 Helicopter
1 Dingy
1 Trike
2 Crew
1 Diver 
& lots of little extras such as a Strecher & a net
The only thing i dont like is the trike. Well i never really liked trikes at all i preferd the motorbikes. But to say this a late 90's set it seems more like an early 90s late 80s  set. So thats why i like the RES Q sets. So if you get a chance you should get it. Hours of fun.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 20 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are really good. We get lot's of black and yellow pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The torso of the LEGO Town (Res-Q) minifigs looks the same in each set. The figures we get in this set have the same white helmet. Only difference is the face. The third minifig is a diver which has the same torso we've seen in the LEGO Town (Extreme Team) sets.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very fun and I didn't have anything to complain about this set. We also get a few stickers which we've to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6462-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>This set has lot's of stuff in it: We get a boat, a motorbike and ha helicopter. The steering wheel on the front of the motorbike can sviwel very nice and easy. The helicopter has two cockpits which can be opened very easily as well. On each side is a container where you can store some stuff and there's also a headlight which you can adjust as well. The propeller on the top and on the back sviwel full 360Â° and we also get a crane which you can use to move the stretcher up and down. There's also a place in the helicopter where you can put the stretcher in.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

"J_tje","2010-03-24T08:40:50.67Z","Horrible Helicopter","<p>That the Rescue/Res-Q subthemes have a futuristic look and feel to it was something that was already pretty obvious too me since the releaswe of the 1992 rescue team set. But this Helicopter (if you can call it that) really takes the cake...., It looks and feels more like a spaceship with a rotter slapped on than a&nbsp; (modern) helicopter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I can't think of any pro's yet I'll start with the cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The size of the model is abnormal. This helicopter is bigger than most (oldschool) planes, the Res-q base, etc.&nbsp;it takes up about one baseplate. If this heli&nbsp;would come&nbsp;to your rescue there is no way it can land. I don't see&nbsp;a realistic way to include it in you town layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The parts used are very standard and not that special. I do like the included trike, dingi and net. (they should have included a place to attach the dingi to the helicopter belly instead of a ""simple""&nbsp; rope and hook).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. How this monster is supposed to fly is a mystery too. I cannot imagine that those little roters can generate enough lift for such a big machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Most of all I find this machine very ugly in reality (although it looks more or less ok on pictures).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. The other Helicopters from the Rescue/Res-Q subthemes are a lot smaller / more practical&nbsp;and almost as versitile.</p>
