"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-11T17:28:54Z","Gold half-sphere","I got mine for the astronaut, computer pieces, levers, and gold half-sphere. The set is hardly useful if kept together. You can attach half-spheres to each other by sticking a technic wedge belt wheel in between the two open ends. If you don't know what that is, look it up on www.peeron.com. It's really cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-15T02:21:42.78Z","Cruise the moon in style","Cheap set but nicely done. Half gold dome is unique to Space Port sets. I like the mini figure, the set is small and fairly simple to assemble. If your into Space Port a Lunar Rover or two are needed to complete your missoion. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-14T11:47:57.45Z","Moon Buggy","This Lunar Rover is quite different to most my other space sets as most of them are bases and flying vehicles and for a space vehicle with wheels this one has alot going for it.

The vehicle drives on four medium size tires and is controlled by two leavers. It has a reflective plate at the front, aerial for radio transmissions, lunar lights on the side of the vehicle and a half gold sphere on the back with instrument panel for long range transmissions and identification.

The mini-fig is white in a full space suit, with a gold reflective visor, just like the real astronauts. The face is standard, with a fringe and a headset. The only real flaw of the whole model is the front piece, which is a sticker.

Overall it's a great little model with lots of features and great aesthetics. I'd say this one is a 7/10, could have been more, if the playability was higher. Makes a nice addition to any space collection and adds something for ground vehicles.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"asianlego","2008-09-21T04:56:18.467Z","Bug catcher?","This vehicle has a striking resemblance to a bug catching device on wheels. The astronaut minifig is cool. I hated the gold dome at the back as it reminds me of my aunt's hideous earrings. The vehicle is however is okay.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"buzzandwoody2000","2008-10-04T13:13:45.75Z","One Of My Best Space Port Rovers ","This is a great set. I love the gold rader system as a computer life form tracker. It rocks with the other sets of space port.
It has a title as the 3erd best space port set. If you see this set, Buy It to add to your space port.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-04T10:44:55.633Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Lunar Rover Review","<p>This is a great little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 36 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a nice value for a model like this.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The astronaut comes wh√≠th a white overall, a white helmet, a golden visor and a nice headset on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also get one sticker which you need to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6463-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The vehicle has a very nice design. On the back we get a radar which can be adjusted. What I like about the radar is the golden piece we get with this model. On each side of this vehicle is a piece which you can adjust and the piece in the front can sviwel, too. It's a really good set - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a small set, so the price was good and it was fairly quick and easy to build. I am just not really impressed with it. There were new printed pieces and the chrome elements where what I wanted to check out.</p>
