"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-12T06:34:21Z","Cool","This was my first big lego set and although it may look unappealing it is great to build and the playability nver ends. The sets are not flimsy and I love the fire truck which you can build by using the tow truck and the fire truck. I also like the small police helicopter.
Pluses:
* GREAT Playability 
* Cool Vechiles and minfigs 
minuses:
* buildings a bit small

Overall a great set and I got this for christmas when I 
was young, so I played with this set alot.

Pros:
A Nice little town for a new lego collection
Fire Truck is neat
Minifigs!!!
Cons:
Police and Fire Bases are ok, but not big enough to be counted as $75
Fire Truck is juinorized
IS $75!!!!!!
Comes with a trike(lame)
3 little complexes(well if you count the end tacky storage place) is good, but all of them are far too juniorized

a good set but not worth $75...take it down to $40 and i would have bought two, instead of 1.....",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

The police station looks more like a shop with a helicopter pad. However, the roadplates and accessories are useful in your Lego town. Overall, this should have been improved before being released.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:32:03.903Z","Good Concept, Bad Implementation","Here's a set in Lego's junior/dark town ages where they wanted to maximize playability but minimize the design.  And when you see what they came up with here, you'll realize that they could've had something big with ideas like this.  

This set was to be a hodge-podge of town themes mixed into a single set.  You got the fire elements, the police elements and the repair elements all mixed in.  You also have two road plates and three smaller base plates mixed in.  Sounds good but this set suffers because the buildings are really dinky.  The repair &quot;building&quot; is embarrassing.  it's hanging a bike.  Anyone can just go in and snatch it.  Where does a customer go in and pay?  The police piece houses a helicopter above a tiny office.  And the fire building is too small to park that massive aerial ladder truck.

Now, if you combined this set's parts with other juniorized sets, you can fill in some of the gaps.  So, again it's great for spare parts to make your junior sets feel less junior-ish and it's actually a cool concept on paper.  But you gotta fill in the walls and the details on a set like this.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-08T05:13:04.967Z","LEGO Town (City) - Super Rescue Complex Review","This is a great set from the past and it's also a great addition to any LEGO city for sure. The build is very easily and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set comes with a lot of stuff: a helicopter, a car, a truck which is going to transport the cars, a fire truck, a fire brigade, a police station, a motorcycle and a garage. The buildings may be small but they look still very good. The blades of the helicopter sviwel full 360° and the front of the motorcycle where the steering wheel is can be moved as well. The truck which can transport the cars has a ramp which can be folded up and/or down. There's also a container on each side where you can store some stuff. The fire truck is very nice, too. The trailer can be removed from the truck and the platform where the ladder is can be taken off as well. It also sviwels full 360°. I really can't complain about this set. In fact: This is a great set to have for sure!<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"sparticusjoe","2018-01-17T19:14:07.693Z","The most playable, least realistic set of the 90's.","<p>This is probably the single most playable and single least realistic set I own. I vividly remember this set being my absolute favorite as a kid, and my copy of it I unearthed is in absolutely immaculate condition, spare parts and all, showing how well twelve year old me took care of this thing. This was absolutely, hands down, my favorite Lego set as a child.</p>

<p>That being said: This is not a good set. The boys and girls at TLC certainly had their priorities in order when designing this thing: Make a city starter set with as many play features as possible, and absolutely nothing else. This set isn&#39;t even vaguely realistic, has a ton of extremely obvious corners cut in its design, has a ton of questionable additions and subtractions, and if you want it to look even vaguely at home in your Lego town you&#39;re either going to have to big time dumb-down the other sets or smarten-up this one. But for what it is, and if you were of the right age when you got it, this set is phenomenal. This set defines &quot;all killer, no filler&quot;. It has just enough things in it to make a youngster excited and interested in creating, as I did, a full-sized town. Every single aspect of this set needs to be expanded in order to make it look good and fit in, but as a starter this set is great and has probably more play features than any other set I have.</p>

<p>It also is absolutely terrible if you&#39;re not a 12 year old kid with an active imagination. None of the buildings within look even that much like buildings, more like the suggestion of a building that&#39;s more like a shed. The vehicles are (almost) all either lazily designed or need some work to reach their full potential. For its size the set needs about twice as many minifigures. An extra two baseplates are needed. Before too long you, as I was as a kid, are buying Lego sets left and right to add onto this city primer and next thing you know half your bedroom is a massive Lego town. To that end it achieves it&#39;s goal.</p>

<p>As with most 1997-1999 Town Jr. sets, the instructions are divided into seperate sheets (unnecessarily, I might add... having them all be one booklet would save me from having lost so many of them nearly 20 years down the line!), so I&#39;ll review as I usually do all the components separately. There are 12 components listed for this set. That is to say, this will be a long review. For the too long; didn&#39;t read cliffnotes version of my review if you don&#39;t want to read the next twelve paragraphs of text: This set really is something special if you&#39;re a kid. If you&#39;re an adult virtually any other city set is more realistic and less half-baked. If you like making MOC&#39;s, this set is excellent for that due to the abundance of strange and exclusive parts, and the necessity for adding things onto it to realise its full potential. All in all, if you were of a certain age at the certain time that Lego #6464 came out, you&#39;ll love it, all else, stay away.</p>

<p><strong>The Police Station:</strong> This is one of three buildings this set comes with. It is, in a word, okay. Right smack dab in the middle of the three. The thing you&#39;ll notice about all of the buildings in this set are that they all lack proper walls, having more just pillars and arches. I get why they did this: so your little fingers can reach in and play with the people inside. It ups the playability and honestly, when i was younger, I don&#39;t remember really minding that at all. These days you can replace all the arches with six 1x6 bricks no problem and make it look like an actual building. The cop shop has one of those cool three-sided windows that were all the rage in the nineties, a really neat looking security camera, and a helipad on the roof. The helipad is okay, the one on the Police Station set released in the same year looks better, but it works fine for what it is. The inside of the building contains a little computer and that&#39;s it. The archway to the right of the building is only 4 studs wide, MUCH too small to actually park a vehicle inside of it, sadly. What I love about this building, and indeed all the models in this set, is that all the minifig accessories have storage clips and compartments to put them when not in use. I always like this extra bit of design in a Lego set, it&#39;s far too easy to lose the tiny pieces without a place to put them.</p>

<p><strong>The Fire Station: </strong>My favorite of the three buildings, though that&#39;s a pretty low bar regardless. Gets plenty of points for the clip bricks to put the walkie talkie and megaphone. I like how the archway has a design that looks like a siren. This building is two stories tall, with the top story being a measly 4 studs wide. Enough to fit a minifigure and his computer inside, and that&#39;s literally it. Pretty small building. This isn&#39;t as good as the fire station in Blaze Brigade, but it&#39;s not bad by any means. The worst part about this building is, as another reviewer mentioned, the archway&#39;s much too small to fit the massive fire truck that comes with this set. It does however fit the other two firefighting vehicles released in the 90&#39;s pretty much perfectly, which is probably the idea. The other worst part is the first floor of the building: It has absolutely nothing in it. Nothing. No computer console, no gear, nothing. Just an empty first floor. You can fix this by MOC-ing in something (as I did... Gave them a little rack to put their firefighting hats on), but stock it is totally barren.</p>

<p><strong>The Garage: </strong>Yeah this is the second worst part about the set. I like that they added it... Your Lego town, once it grows out from this central point, will have so many police and fire stations it will make you sick, so it&#39;s nice to have another type of building that isn&#39;t just furthering the Lego police state, but man oh man could they have done a better job with this building. It&#39;s barely even a shed. No roof, no walls, just a chain, a tool rack, and a (actually pretty neat looking) fuel tank. That&#39;s it. It pairs well with either the incredibly bad Octan Gas Station set from the same year, or the later released Roadside Repair set, but as-is this thing is two walls and a chain. That said, the included cars and motorcycle fit inside of this building perfectly so it isn&#39;t a total loss. The playability is quite high, you can lift the bike and the car with the chain and have the mechanic fix it, but the displayability is basically nil. Small children have built and designed more mechanic-shop looking mechanic shops than this one.</p>

<p><strong>The Motorcycle/Trike: </strong>Hey, Lego included a separate instruction book for it so i&#39;ll review it as if it were more important than it is. It&#39;s your standard late nineties three-wheeled motorcycle, the type that barely exists in real life but everybody in Lego Land seems to own. Nearly every motorcycle I&#39;ve ever seen has two, not three, wheels, but whaddya do, this was the style of the time. It&#39;s as generic as it gets and mostly useful for giving the mechanic something to do.</p>

<p><strong>The Car: </strong>Aaaand the worst part of the set. The late nineties was a rough time for car design in Lego Town, and this is no exception. It&#39;s almost identical to the one included in the abysmal Octan Gas Station set released in 1997 and is just as sad as the one included there. It&#39;s literally five pieces if you discount the tires and doesn&#39;t look like any type of car known to man. Lego surprisingly gave every single vehicle in this set a roof, a minor miracle considering the time period... Except this one, which is not just a convertible but the only modern car known to man that actually has no windshield, at all. This thing is trash.</p>

<p><strong>The Flatbed Truck</strong><strong>: </strong>I like this thing. First of all, it has a roof, a rarity for vehicles of the era (sad, but true...). Second, it&#39;s really functional and playable. The small yellow go-kart thing masquerading as a car fits perfectly on the flatbed so you can enact breakdowns with the tow truck taking the car to the mechanic shed thing well with it. There are two side cabinets on the truck to hold various tools and minifig accessories you&#39;ll bring with you on the job, which I appreciate, and the front grill makes it look like a reasonably realistic piece of heavy machinery. The chassis is all one piece, something I know some people hate but honestly never bothered me growing up, and the headlights are printed instead of being an assembly, so there&#39;s still 1990&#39;s bad town juniorisation on it, but for what it is it&#39;s a surprisingly inspired design.</p>

<p><strong>The Police Helicopter: </strong>Let me start this section by saying that if you have all the Town Jr.-era sets, you have not one, not two, not even three, but four police helicopters, so it&#39;s hard to get all that excited about this particular one when I have so many. (Roadblock Runners, Helicopter Transport, Command Post Central, and this set being the four). Where does this one rank? Pretty close to the bottom. The windshield is that annoying massive piece that is good for absolutely nothing except for being a helicopter cockpit, the back of the &#39;copter is a massive 2x8 brick that would look a lot better if it were only one stud wide, the top of the helicopter bafflingly has a yellow and red brick attached to it that completely color clashes with the rest of the model, and the skids are, as usual, all one piece. It&#39;s fine for what it is but no more than that. I replaced it with the one from Command Post Central, which is probably the best of the four. The helicopter body is all one massive weirdly shaped brick that isn&#39;t really good for anything else, also, so there&#39;s that. I also find it odd that the police force in this set is a helicopter and that&#39;s it. No patrol vehicles, no motorcycles, nothing. Just the one thing that a 90&#39;s kid with a ton of Town sets already has. I dig the pair of &quot;POLICE&quot; printed tiles on the skids. They&#39;re much better used on another model.</p>

<p><strong>The Fire Truck Semi: </strong>Yes, all three components of this thing have their own instructions, no, I don&#39;t know why. There isn&#39;t much to say about this one. It&#39;s surprisingly small for how much and big the trailer it&#39;s pulling is. Only four wheels. About as basic as a semi gets. I like the design of the semi in, say, Speedway Transport, but this one is as barebones as it gets. It has a cab and a rollbar (it was the law in the late nineties to put a rollbar on absolutely every vehicle ever, regardless of sense). The pieces are all printed, though. Gotta love that about Town Jr., virtually no stickers ever.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Truck Trailer: </strong>The trailer and the areal are seperate models for some reason with their own instruction sets. I&#39;m not honestly all that sure why. The areal could easily be attached to be just a part of the trailer without anything really changing, it&#39;s not like ladders come off their dedicated fire trucks like that in real life, but there it is. This is a great example of the utilitarian design of this whole thing: Basically all the trailer is is a bunch of minifigure accessories for maximum playability. Oxygen tanks, helmets, loudspeakers, a pair of fire extinguishers (great touch, though at least out here in the USA fire extinguishers are generally red, not yellow... Probably different in Denmark, though), and the lone detail for the trailer, the back cab area where presumably an operator controls the (pointlessly removable) ladder assembly. All those minifig accessories are just slapped any old place on the trailer. Need a place to put a rebreather? No problem, TLC just shoved a white minifig head brick on the front of the trailer and slapped the accessory on it. When you&#39;re a kid (who are, let&#39;s be honest, the target audience of virtually everything TLC makes), this doesn&#39;t bother you one bit. When you&#39;re an adult as I am now looking at the model in front of you, you can&#39;t help but wonder if there was a more organic way to put that piece on the trailer. Oh well.</p>

<p><strong>The Ladder Assembly: </strong>This piece is all based on the same type of skid brick that&#39;s normally used for helicopter skids. It&#39;s fine, all playability, no realism as with all of the set. The ladders have a place to hang (I really like that detail), the main ladder is on a hinge, it rotates, the ladder extends, you can pose minifigures on the ladder no problem, and there&#39;s a hose just slapped on there too. None of it looks even vaguely organic or real, but it&#39;s got like seven play features in one maybe thirty part assembly. Gotta love that. The big problem with the whole fire truck as a whole is that it doesn&#39;t fit in the space for it in the fire station. Less of a big deal when you pair this with Blaze Brigade. Looks pretty good in scale with that much larger fire station, honestly.</p>

<p><strong>The Road Baseplates/Accessories: </strong>One of the easier ways to get ahold of these super rare baseplate parts these days. They look great, are very much in scale with vehicles from the era and very much not in scale to anything made in the modern day, and you get two of them with this set. The accessories that come with are all amazing, a huge collection of signs, SUPER rare post office box bricks (literally only came out in this and one other, equally impossible to find set), a bunch of mail bricks, a construction barrier, a ton of super rare, occasionally exclusive sign clip on bricks, and two of those cute old timey tiny tree bricks.Odd it only comes with one flower brick, with those being as tiny and cheap as they are you&#39;d think there&#39;d be multiple. Only real complaint about this part of the set is that they don&#39;t include nearly enough stuff to link it all together. Get some 2x2 green tile bricks to attach the three buildings to the ends of the road plates, makes the set look that much more cohesive.</p>

<p><strong>The Alternate Models: </strong>Okay, so this isn&#39;t really a model, but it has its own instruction booklet so i&#39;m including it. I love this part about the set. Lego actually included, sort of like they did with the old 9v train sets, an extra booklet with a ton of extra building ideas you could make with the set (some of which are honestly a bit better designed than the set itself). They also included a good ten extra parts that aren&#39;t in the main model just for added fun rebuilding the set into MOC&#39;s, it has a digger dumper brick assembly, a dump truck bed, a tow truck hook, and a bunch of other bricks with no real function except to create your own stuff with. This is super cool and it would be nice to see Lego do this more (though for all they know they might be nowadays, last time I bought a non-used Lego set was in the late nineties). As a kid I always loved rebuilding things with the alternate models on the back of the box and trying to get things to match up as perfectly as possible (I was a boring kid, I know), and this gives you five or six different things to try. Super cool and makes this already super playable set even more playable.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>To build the stock main model (the Complex, if you will), the building experience is as good as any 90&#39;s town set. You stack walls and prefab pieces, that&#39;s about it. However the presence of all the extra parts and the entire manual of alternate models elevates this to probably the best building experience of the late 90&#39;s Town lineup. I really appreciate the extra effort to making this admittedly extremely expensive set have all the more value.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Superb. Tons and tons of rare, exclusive, and desirable pieces here. Printed pieces for days, not a single sticker to be found. Most of the parts can be re-used for better and more realistic models than this one. The mailbox bricks are just about impossible to find otherwise so that&#39;s the highlight of the set, but the huge supply of other chassis, printed pieces, a ton of signs, the trees, the rare mechanic minifig torso, a ton of firefighting accessories, this set has it all. It&#39;s a jack of all trades type of set; if you have a mechanic set, police set, or firefighter set that needs expansion, this set will do it for you.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Easily the highest one of any of the sets I have. Literally every model is jam packed with small details for a kid to play with and an adult to go &quot;why the heck is that there? You wouldn&#39;t put a megaphone outside to be exposed to the elements...&quot;. This set was designed with one thing in mind and that was for little kids to have a blast with it. Now if you&#39;re like me and a crabby old man that doesn&#39;t really play with sets so much as he displays those sets, the displayability is, in a vacuum, really low. None of the buildings or vehicles are great looking without extensive modification. That said my nostalgia for this set is so high I usually have up on a shelf somewhere because I like it so much, so your results may vary.</p>

<p><strong>Value For The Money: </strong>This depends so much I can&#39;t decide to give it a 5 or a 1, so I&#39;ll just say a 3. It really depends. If you were a kid and had it, it&#39;s worth the extremely steep price tag to see the nucleus of your town again. If you weren&#39;t a kid with it and have no nostalgia for it... Don&#39;t buy it. It&#39;s extremely, brutally expensive and really hard to find even if you are willing to part with the money, usually requiring bricklink overseas importation with all the fun steep shipping, long wait times, and wondering if the 100+ dollar set you bought will be eaten alive by customs for no reason. If you want to display a 90&#39;s Town set for some reason, get the dedicated cop shop, fire station, or mechanic&#39;s shop, they&#39;re all better, more cohesive looking sets than this one. In other words, you already know if this is a good value or not. If it meant anything to you in your childhood, or if you&#39;re like me and kindled a love of modeling that even these days pushing 30 I still have, it is worth a few hundred dollars. However I can&#39;t imagine that applies to more people than just me and maybe two or three other people, so otherwise don&#39;t bother if your nostalgia goggles aren&#39;t as welded to your face as mine are.</p>
