<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it as well.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 66 pieces. I don't know how much this model was when it was on sale but I think it's worth the money for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The astronaut has a white overall, a white helmet, a golden visor and a headset on his face. It's a good figure to have as well.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also get some stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6465-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do much but it's still very easy to maneuver it. It also looks very fast. The only play feature we get is that you can open the top of the engine on the back. As I told you in the beginning: This is a great set to have.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
