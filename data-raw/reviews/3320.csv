"CyandraZ","2008-03-16T15:58:27.45Z","Not worth your time.","Okay, I was a young kid when I got this, and I didn’t care about design or other qualities, but I now realize that this kit was, IS, not worth it. 

I mean, the pit stop is just a few beans and girders on either side with a long red plate on top, with a bunch of tools, gadgets, and other stuff slapped on in the middle and on top. A child could have literally design this kit! That’s not very good at all considering that several adults designed it. &gt;_&gt;

The race car is also lame. Yeah, it’s not half bad, but the race cars of old make this look pathetic. Once again, no real design at all. Just a few beans and slopes thrown on a chassis. 

How about the pieces? You do get a set of tools, stop sign, lasso, and a few other accessories, plus two white girders, but other than that there is no real value, piece wise.

The one good thing about 6467? The racecar driver is pretty cool. However, I have so many blue Octan mechanics now that I am kinda sick of them. 

Overall, this kit is not worth your time, as are basically all the Town Jr kits. Ignore them, and you will be much more content with your purchases. 3/10

I realized a year ago that I had to sell this because Lego town sets in 98-99 were terrible. I am very happy that I sold this set for $10 and it will never be in my collection again.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-14T17:41:33.35Z","Great for kids, better than you'd think for adults.","<p>Next up on the &quot;rescued from a storage bin in an attic&quot; list for me to review is 6467- Power Pitstop. I fondly remember this thing from my childhood, this mixed with the other racing sets of the time, both impulse sets and larger sets like Speedway Transport both compliment this set extremely well. I&#39;d set up huge racetracks in my bedroom and my brother and I would race these cars all over them... Good times. So how does this set hold up nearly 20 years later? Surprisingly well, honestly. It isn&#39;t probably the best racing set TLC has ever made, but it&#39;s also relatively cheap and you do get a lot of good stuff for how little money it is.<strong> </strong>As with most Town Jr. sets, there are two instructions for both parts of the model so I&#39;ll review them seperately.</p>

<p><strong>The Race Car: </strong>I like this little thing. It looks appropriately like a formula 1 car (though I am by no means an expert on that topic at all). It actually has a chair in it for the driver to sit on, something TLC was oddly averse to putting in any vehicles at all in the 90&#39;s. The printed pieces that make up the sides and the grill look attractive with a green, yellow, and red color scheme that&#39;s carried over to the model itself, with the spoilers green, the chair red, and the rest yellow. It looks pretty sharp and has those cool smooth racing-style tiny wheels that were all the rage at the time. It actually is to scale to the two minifigures included and if you get Speedway Transport or any number of 90&#39;s race car impulse sets (which I had several of, reviews coming soon), this fits in superbly with them as the number two in the racecar line-up. My only complaint is it really looks like it could use something for a windshield. Perhaps a transparent 2x2 sloped block in front of it? I don&#39;t know, it just looks bare on the front of it.</p>

<p><strong>The Pit Stop: </strong>My big complaint for this part out of the way first: It really could use a baseplate. Having a huge 6x16 green plate as the base is cool just because a plate that huge is sort of rare and you can never have too many of them, but a baseplate would make it fit in with its Lego Town surroundings better. I know some people don&#39;t like baseplates as they, in fairness, do constrain you to only being able to build buildings on them, they can&#39;t be used for things like roofs, but I really like the little things and would have rather had one here.</p>

<p>Other than that? I really like the design of this thing. It would&#39;ve been nice to just get six 1x2 white bricks instead of the two pre-made pillar bricks, but other than that no complaints at all. The huge 2x16 red plate serving as the &quot;roof&quot; of the piece looks pretty good how it is. There&#39;s everything inside of this set you&#39;d need to serve as a pitstop for a race car: spare tires, several tools (with tool rack! I love it when accessories have somewhere to go when not in use), one of those rare and actually functional jack pieces, and a fuel tank. The lap timer is an excellent detail and the fact that the &quot;STOP&quot; sign (printed, no less!) pivots up and down adds even more playability. The mechanic figure (with Octan branding, of course they&#39;d sponsor Lego racing) is a welcome addition to any Lego town, always nice to have more blue collar guys for one.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>I&#39;m knocking it a point for the large juniorized pre-built column pillar brick things that very, very easily could&#39;ve just been seperate pieces to bolster the piece count and add some extra value and re-buildability to this set. Oh well. Other than that the building experience is fine, if a little short. Nothing wrong with it certainly. Using a whip brick as a fuel hose is brilliant, the whole stop sign assembly is cute and uses a hinged antennae brick in a way I wouldn&#39;t have expected, and my favorite part is the spare tire holders. Using a 1x2 plate with a bar attached to it TLC have made a very cute little rack to keep tires on when not in use, which is something I never would&#39;ve thought of and is a creative use of a mundane piece.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>For being a ten dollar quasi-impulse-buy set... Really good. Right off the bat, because it&#39;s 1999 and a town set: Printed pieces all over the place! The Octan lap timer, the STOP sign, the sides and front of the race car, all printed, all wonderful, all still holding up great after almost twenty years. The antennae bricks used as the stop sign holder aren&#39;t common, the whip brick isn&#39;t particularly easy to find, the pair of 16 stud width plates are rare-is, and of course all the printed race car pieces are either extremely uncommon or maybe even exclusive, not sure which. Point is, there&#39;s a lot of good stuff here for the low price. The jack brick is only in the low double digits of sets too.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Very high for a kid, of course. It&#39;s a race car and a mechanic. What&#39;s cooler than that? Admittedly it could use *two* race cars, for someone to race against, but you can play with him doing time trials with just the one. It does pair very well with Speedway Transport, too. For an adult, the displayability is... Pretty high. There&#39;s enough accessories and things you can do with this that you can make different poses and scenes with it. The fact that the gas pump attaches to the car and the jack actually is functional boosts this a lot. Fun set.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>For ten dollars it&#39;s a good deal. Not a *great* deal, but a good deal. Despite the alleged &quot;limited release&quot; of this thing, it&#39;s one of the more common Town Jr. sets to pop up for sale on eBay for an actually okay price now and then. It can be found on bricklink for not a ton more than ten dollars and is worth that. It isn&#39;t thirty-forty dollars worth of Lego sets, but for a set that&#39;s just a step above &quot;impulse buy&quot;, it really isn&#39;t a bad deal at all.</p>
