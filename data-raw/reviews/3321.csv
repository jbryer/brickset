Okay, so we could all use a nice tow truck for our town, but this kit does not provide any such thing. The “Tow Truck” in this kit is made up of a measly 21 pieces, taking juniorization to the max. Also, it’s completely unrealistic, “sporting” giant yellow lights, a strange hook support, and no roof whatsoever!

Even worse is the fact that instead of a generic civilian vehicle, the kit includes a tiny go-cart made up of 18 pieces, something you would never find on the streets in real life, much less carried by a tow truck. &gt;_&lt;

And without any special pieces (just some “specialized” pieces), this kit is a complete rip off, even though it includes a nice tow truck driver. So, my final analysis is as clear as a bell: don’t buy this kit. 1/10.

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-22T18:43:22.587Z","It's a good parts kit, little else.","<p>Some sets are just made to be cannibalized into other sets. This is one of those sets. Most of my Lego sets from my childhood that I&#39;ve uncovered came in little plastic baggies seperating them all out. This is one that was just laying in pieces among my spares in the bottom of the bucket, which is hardly surprising, having re-assembled it. What&#39;s here is okay, it&#39;s just not great and can easily be made better. As with most &#39;90&#39;s Town sets, the instructions are pointlessly divided onto two different sheets, so I&#39;ll review them both separately.</p>

<p><strong>The Tow Truck: </strong>Hey, look, it&#39;s a late nineties vehicle with no roof or doors whatsoever. A convertible tow truck? Never seen that one before outside of late nineties town sets. But if you collect this era&#39;s Town sets, you&#39;ll see that so much you become desensitized to how weird it is that Lego seemed to think tow trucks, garbage trucks, armored cars, fire trucks, the list goes on, don&#39;t have roofs. Surprisingly enough, this one doesn&#39;t have a roof. I guess that ups the playability (though I personally don&#39;t think I&#39;d have cared one bit to have to just take the roof brick off, take the minifigure out, and put the roof bit back on as a kid), but it decreases the realism of the set to comical levels. So we&#39;re off to a bad start with a weird, cartoony outlined tow truck right off the bat.</p>

<p>Speaking of cartoony, it has this huge human-hand sized crank wheel on the side of it. This is somewhat understandable (Legos are, after all, first and foremost toys made to be interfaced with by humans, particularly younger smaller ones), but it certainly sticks out like a sore thumb, adding two extra studs&#39; width to the side of the vehicle and looking hideous. I&#39;ll give it a pass though because I can&#39;t think of any better way to add a winch to the thing, it just makes it look even more cartoony.</p>

<p>The siren is a nice touch, though the yellow color doesn&#39;t really look like a siren, and the printed bricks (love me some printed bricks) with the mechanic logo on them are always welcome in my town. However, I don&#39;t really like the design of the tow truck crane arm... The stringed up hook doesn&#39;t stay on it almost at all. Threading the string through a technic hole brick would&#39;ve made it actually stay in place, as is there&#39;s really nothing keeping it on there at all. Lego has solved this problem with future tow trucks easily, but with this one it&#39;s an issue. Try taking a corner while towing something with this, the rope just flies off to one side or another. This tow truck already doesn&#39;t have much going for it, it doesn&#39;t need this gripe added onto the pile.</p>

<p>Another gripe I have with this part of the set is the only accessory included with the set: The walkie talkie. The cab of the truck is so small the minifigure can&#39;t fit in the truck while holding the walkie... and there isn&#39;t anywhere else to put it on the truck, at all. No clip plates whatsoever to store the thing in. It doesn&#39;t fit anywhere and honestly probably would have been more handy had it not been thrown in there, because you can&#39;t store it on the set so you&#39;ll probably just lose it.</p>

<p><strong>The Race Car: </strong>This little thing grows up to be the race car from the &quot;Power Pitstop&quot; set. Seriously, it&#39;s just that race car but like five studs shorter for some reason. This thing looks much more like a Go-Kart than a race car (and much more like a Go-Kart than my previously reviewed &quot;Go Kart&quot; impulse set), and that&#39;s kind of unfortunate because it doesn&#39;t fit in well with any of the other race cars from the same time period. If you have the (actually pretty good) Speedway Transport set, the (actually really good) Power Pitstop set, or one of the millions of impulse buy polybag race car sets... They&#39;re pretty much all bigger than this little thing. So I guess if you want a sawed-off race car for some reason, this is your guy. It looks okay for what it is, I just don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t extend it a few studs and make it look actually good instead of just okay.</p>

<p>Also going against it is the number: yellow &quot;2&quot; with green stripes through it. There&#39;s already a Lego race car with that exact number and color scheme in Power Pitstop, though it actually looks good. There isn&#39;t much going for this part either, is what I&#39;m getting at.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>It&#39;s a late nineties Lego Town set, there isn&#39;t any as there almost never was. They couldn&#39;t even be bothered to make the race car full length let alone add any advanced building techniques.The chassis are pre-made, the hook doesn&#39;t stay in the boom, the race car is a worse version of something that already exists. Not much in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Hands down the best part of the set. The printed 2x2 &quot;2&quot; numbered slope, the two mechanic wrench 4x1 bricks, the winch brick (which is only in three other sets in this configuration, one of which is a Divers set which are brutally rare and expensive to the point I never had a single one of them), the boom brick (which can be used for better things), the yellow sirens (rare color), the race car driver&#39;s fancy decorated helmet and torso... All sorts of good parts here, many of which are extremely hard to find outside of this one extremely common set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>I want to rate this higher, I really do, but there are so many flaws with this thing that the playability only is high when you modify it so much it doesn&#39;t look like the original set at all. I try to rate all of these sets in a vacuum, because as far as I know some poor kid only has this one set as his only set or doesn&#39;t have any matching ones, and without a ton of other pieces and sets to add on to this thing there really isn&#39;t a very good play experience with this.</p>

<p>The one point I am giving it is for the blue bumper brick which makes an effective device for attaching the hook to the race car. That&#39;s clever and works well. Sadly since the hook doesn&#39;t stay in the crane arm even vaguely, even that&#39;s a wash.</p>

<p>The displayability is minimal. You can, but you probably won&#39;t want to due to the extremely cartoony tow truck (the other, green and white tow truck set released later this same year with the articulated arm is a much better alternative if you understandably want a tow truck model for your town) and the Power Pitstop But Worse race car, there&#39;s no real reason to display it. The minifigures are nice at least.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>I&#39;ll give this a three simply because it isn&#39;t much money. This set&#39;s extremely common and for five bucks you get some parts to build other bigger better vehicles and an extremely rare and handy winch brick that you&#39;ll absolutely find a better use for than what it&#39;s doing in this set, as well as two minifigures and a ton of printed parts.</p>

<p>It normally goes for five to ten dollars and is probably worth that for the winch and the two figures. Don&#39;t go above that and certainly don&#39;t go out of your way to seek out this set, it isn&#39;t worth that at all. It&#39;s a fine &quot;add this to your cart on impulse when buying a nicer set&quot; item, but little else, except as an economical way to buy a winch brick.</p>
