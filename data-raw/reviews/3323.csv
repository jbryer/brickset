"mrmitch","2007-06-15T02:25:51.5Z","Must have construction equipment to work in tight spaces","This Mini Dump truck does actually dump. Simple small set with good design and nice looking worker. This partical set has remained assembled in the LEGO cabinet for 6+ years. Great little set to add to you city/town collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2008-01-01T20:55:44.86Z","What does it dump?","Costing five dollars this seems a little bit overpriced for the few pieces you get. There is one minifig included here. He’s wearing an orange jumpsuit and really looks like he belongs at a construction site there are even some reflectors on his uniform.
The truck is small but the chassis is one part with the axles built in (juniorization). The dumping feature works okay but it would have been nice to have something to dump (a few brown studs).
Overall a neat little set Lego did a good job on making a small construction vehicle it would look good on pretty much any construction site. In general it’s good but there are several small problems I have to deduct marks for. 4/5

"hustla187","2008-11-30T20:23:10.077Z","Good for Small Jobs","This isn't bad but has some flaws. First, it shouldn't be called a mini dump truck. Second, it looks like one of those town sets that was considered to be juniored. However, this isn't that bad for a small set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BlackRabbit","2008-04-12T19:15:54.043Z","only having 4 dollars doesnt mean you still cant buy lego","well its cheap and effective .it comes with one constuction worker and a slightly rare bucket peice it goes well with any town theme whether it be building houses or destorying them. it has a simple colour scheme yellow, black,and the odd bluealso the design is pretty simple

"jonbuddy","2008-11-30T15:22:50.717Z","Teeny-Tiny Dump Truck","This is a great. Brings back memories. I don't know where the heck this is in my house, though. To note: most sets from 2000 and back were obtained from my sister or were bought on Ebay (like the Solar Power Transporter).

Good:
Simple
Yellow
Nice Tires
Rare Yellow Tire holders
Minifig
Can Dump

Bad:
Manual Dumping (but making it a contraption wouldn't make the set simple)

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T20:54:49.233Z","To Dump or not To Dump","<p>Set #6470 Mini-Dump Truck: This set is the only one I kept from the original Town sets I had, most of the rest consisted mainly of the Mini-Figures, the rest of the sets were parts missing, lost, broken and instructions missing, lost. Really a shame too, I liked that mini pizza place I used to have...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that aside, this set is a fun little addition to any Town display - it may be small, but it serves a purpose. When dealing with tight corners the much larger dump trucks would probably crush the buildings while working. But with these... Can you just see an army of these little dudes zipping around the middle of Downtown LEGO City? Saves on traffic problems and gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is an excellent addition to this fun little set... Dare I say cute? Yes it is a cute set and easy to build, takes less than two minutes for an experienced Lego Builder and for a child... I'd have to say they wouldn't take that long either to figure it all out and then they'd have a neat toy to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is like the McDonald's sets of the 80's... And boy were those things fun? Sets that offer pick up and play and expanding the imagination - you can dump anything from the dumper you put your mind to. Lightsaber blades, bricks, studs, pistols, tools, mini-figure accessories of assorted sizes. The skies the limits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can find it for sale cheap snatch it up. It's a brilliant little set and well worth the investment.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-20T09:21:26.28Z","LEGO Town (City) - Mini Dump Truck Review","<p>This is a good set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 12 cents per piece.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig has an orange overall, a white helmet and a gray beard on his face. It's a great figure to have for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6470-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This vehicle may doesn't do much but it's still fun to maneuver with. The only play feature we get is that the shovel on the front an be adjusted. This set is a good addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"GBP_Chris","2011-07-05T13:25:31.117Z","Absolutely LOVED this set","I loved this set when I was little! It was a nice set for a five year old (at the time) Lego fan who liked construction vehicles. I especially love the beam pieces that connect the vehicle and shovel. The only issue is that I had lost the instructions. But thanks to Brickset, I downloaded them again. Overall, this set is a classic! Buy it if you see it.",FALSE,5,4,5,5,5
