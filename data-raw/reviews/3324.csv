I have to agree it is a bit bulky and it has like 6 peices, but the good thing is its wheels are nice and the playability value is high. it could do better with more detail and less bulkyness.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-17T16:03:08Z","wheels look out of place","I agree with lord penguin.there isn't much gear and the tires look like they should be on a semi,not a cop car(If anyone sees those tires one a semi let me know^-^).the reason I made this a 6 is the cop and radio are valuble to me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-20T16:05:49Z","YAY!","I bought this set on a vacation. I can't believe how many hours I spent building altermate models! The set is quite nifty though, and I disagree with Lord Penguin that it's a waste of time. All sets are good for parts, and this is no exception. (Mmmmmm....fenders.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

the car may look odd..but you can rebuilt it by placing other wheels under it and use the big wheels for a truck or a monstertuck 

i really liked this set (i rebuilt it in 2 hours after bulding) and used the wheels for my truck, the blue slopes for my ambulance and the fenders for my copcar

This is a perfect example of that. One of the star cops in our towns police force. Good looking set, do like the bigger tires and raised platform-it gives it a different look.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 30 pieces and it was 5 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 17 cents per piece when it was on sale which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The police officer has a black uniform, a black cap and black sunglasses on his face. It's a very nice figure to have for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers.<br></p>

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-08T20:04:05.373Z","It's just sort of... There.","<p>Next on the &quot;late nineties lego set reviewing block&quot; for me is 6471, 4WD Police Patrol, one of many Town impulse sets I&#39;ve recently found and reconstructed. To sum up this model in a word, that word would be &quot;meh&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>It&#39;s not the worst model Lego ever made, but it&#39;s really, really close. It doesn&#39;t look super much like any police vehicle I&#39;ve ever seen, and the strangest part is how it&#39;s way bigger than pretty much any of the previous &quot;City Center&quot; and &quot;Town Jr.&quot; sets up until this point. Put this thing next to the Command Post Station Town Jr. set, and whoa momma does it stand out as being way too tall. This is due to the usage of the huge wheels, which is presumably there to make it a &quot;4WD&quot; vehicle. Having grown up (and still residing in) an extremely rural area with many unpaved roads, I can pretty easily say with confidence that no police vehicle actually looks anything like this. They certainly have all terrain vehicles at the sheriff&#39;s office, but they aren&#39;t 1.5 times the size of a human, as this vehicle is in comparison to the minifigure that comes with it.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a police monster truck, granted. Is it a <em>good</em> police monster truck, then? Well... Sort of. I mean it looks fine. It&#39;s got the police badge on the front of it, two transparent blue slope blocks that sort of kind of could be a siren if you relocated them to the top of the rollbar (they just seem like turn signals as-is), and the windshield is a neat color. That said there is no roof (as there never seems to be in vehicles of this era), nor doors, nor obvious way for our poor minifigure friend to climb all the way up there. Normally I&#39;d say something about how &quot;with a little modification you can *make* it into an acceptable vehicle&quot; but with this one you really can&#39;t without just scrapping and rebuilding it. The thing&#39;s so tiny and disproportionately tall that itd be even more comically disproportionate if you built, say, a roof over it.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Not much to say about this one. No advanced techniques obviously and no real interesting pieces to warrant such techniques. You can build it in a minute and take it apart in half that. It&#39;s not like actively unpleasant to build but it&#39;s also not super fun.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Oh man is there little going for this truck on this front. Virtually none of the parts with only one exception is even remotely rare. The front grill with the police badge on it only appears in a handful of sets and is rare. That said the general consensus among most AFOL&#39;s that I know is that the printed pre-made grills are undesirable and they&#39;d rather just build a grill from scratch so even then it&#39;s doubtful many hardcore collectors would want it. The rest of the parts are so common I reckon probably half of the people reading this could build this set from parts they have in their collection already.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>I mean it&#39;s a Lego set, so it&#39;s plenty playable if you&#39;re a kid with an active imagination as I was. If you&#39;re an AFOL, the &quot;displayability&quot; of it is pretty low mostly because it just doesn&#39;t fit in with much. The proportions are weird, it doesn&#39;t look even remotely interesting, and the accessories are few and far between. The policeman gets outfitted with a megaphone and what will undoubtably be the sixteen thousandth walkie-talkie you&#39;ll have in your lego collection (man, did Lego love spamming these things everywhere back in the nineties). As I&#39;ve stated in previous reviews, I&#39;m a huge fan of when Lego gives you a place to actually put the accessories in the set when your figure isn&#39;t holding them. Tool racks and C-clips and cupboard bricks go a long way to enhance the displayability of a set, making there be a place to put the things instead of just having a million hand tools cluttering the ground everywhere. This set has absolutely none. The megaphone of course just locks in place to any old stud but the walkie talkie... Even Lego didn&#39;t know what to do with it in the box art, it&#39;s just kinda flying way back behind the vehicle like that. If you want to outfit Officer Friendly here with any other accessories, be they handcuffs or one of Johnny Thunder&#39;s revolvers... There&#39;s no place to really put them in this vehicle, either.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Probably the best part of the set, which isn&#39;t necessarily a god thing. It gets a flat three in this category because, well, it&#39;s cheap. Really cheap. Still is, you can find them for a couple bucks on Bricklink and ebay no problem. Is it worth that? I don&#39;t know. If you&#39;re a completionist, sure. If you like making a town display... Probably not, just skip it. There are better police cars out there. If you really want a police-badge branded white grill piece, this is the cheapest way you&#39;re gonna get it, and that really is the only part of any note in this set. Police sets are a dime a dozen and this one is probably not worth that dime. Skip it.</p>
