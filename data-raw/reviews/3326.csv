"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T03:42:04.17Z","Ready For Action…","This set looks great mounted on my bookshelf and it’s the only hovercraft that I have in my collection, at the moment!   I hadn’t looked at the Res-Q line very much, but this set was being sold for just £12 with box so I couldn’t really resist it at that price (who could?).   

I simply love the ‘cushion’ which wraps around the entire craft.   The double cockpit and storage lockers house lots of tools which come with the set.   The style of the hovercraft is very futuristic; the navigation lights are housed in grey surrounds and are mounted close to the ‘chrome’ searchlights.   The twin propellers are mounted on folding brackets, but the reason for this is not apparent as access to the vehicle bay is possible with the brackets in the ‘closed’ position!   The roving vehicle is unspectacular but serves its purpose I guess but it does store nicely on board the main craft after accessing the bay via a loading ramp.

I think Lego have done a great job on this set, I can’t really fault it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-04T11:17:38.557Z","LEGO Town (Res-Q) - Res-Q Cruiser Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 24 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of good parts in it. Some pieces are also rubbery. This set has a lot of great pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The torso of the minifig is the same we've seen in all LEGO Town (Res-Q) sets. 2 figures also have the same face and the same headgear. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very fun and I didn't have any problems with this set. We also get a few stickers to worry about.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6473-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>This set has lot's of good stuff in it: We get an atv which has 3 tyres on each side, a shovel on the back which you can sviwell and a claw which you can adjust as well. The boat has two cockpits which you can open very easily. On each side is a container where you can store some stuff in it and on each side you can also see 2 chainsaws. The propellers on the back can sviwel full 360° and we also get a headlight which you can adjust as well. On the back is also a platform where you can put the atv. I really can't complain about this set. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J_tje","2010-03-28T04:58:01.03Z","Heavenly Hovercraft","After my disappointment with the 6462 Aerial Recovery set (Horrible Helicopter) I was very pleasantly surprised by this set. Its my first Hovercraft and I love it. <br><br>The Hovercraft is big and sturdy which gives it great playability, It has a large loading deck that comes with a nice, rather big practical vehicle. Very nice is the way this vehicle can hold on to the Hovercraft with its motorarm. Good feature is the moverable blades in the back to facilitate the loading deck.<br><br>The set has many nice parts that you don't see that often. (Rubber corners and straits, robotarm, light, etc. etc.). 3 minifigs are included as well as some nice tools.<br><br>Big thumbs up. <br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
