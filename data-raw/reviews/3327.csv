"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-16T21:32:21Z","GREAT SET","This is another set I got while I was in France and it is a great construction set. It is fun to play with and fun to build. It goes well with the dumper and has a great play value. Never running out of values. Nothing wrong with it and is great to build and play with. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2008-01-01T20:39:52.2Z","Not very eye pleasing","This is probably the weakest part of the 2000 town/construction theme. There is one minifig included in this set, just your average construction worker he has a white hard hat and some blue overalls. There are no accessories except a chain it would have been nice if the worker had a shovel or something.
For ten dollars it’s fairly big because it actually uses a lot of big pieces the base is one piece with the wheels attached underneath. There is a small hinge piece that holds a hook on it. This is so you can attach either the hook of the shovel to the boom. The cockpit contains only a steering wheel. The roof can be easily removed to put the guy in it. The boom looks very weak and somewhat cartoony which I really don't like. For playability there should have been some ruble or a little thing to be moved around by the tractor even if it bumped the cost up a bit.
Overall an okay set if you like really cartoony vehicles or are looking for an okay construction set. Because of nothing to move around and an overall weird looking vehicle I have to subtract some marks. 3.5/5

I am an engineer so I love all the construction set, this set as a little juniarized but is ok, the minifigure is very nice.
I am going to give this set a 5 because it was the one!

"alva","2010-12-20T05:58:37.373Z","Nice small set","This set is among the first sets that I bought when I return from the dark age.<br>I found this set on 2008, on a small gift shop in my hometown, Bandung, Indonesia.<br>They were just stacked there, hidden between hotwheels and other toys.<br>It was really like found a hidden treasure. And the price is quite cheap, I bought each for Rp.69.000 (around USD 6). <br>Bought three sets and build one. Still keeping the other two:P<br>The yellow color is really nice. and the final result is really great. Especially if you have others construction line, this set really fit in nicely.<br><br>If you happens to stumble on one, my recommendation is do not think too much. Just grab it and start to build it:)<br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-24T10:51:45.917Z","LEGO Town (City) - 4-Wheeled Front Shovel Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>There're 2 instructions in this set and both instructions don't have any mistakes.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 52 pieces and it was 7 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 14 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig has a blue overall, an orange jacket and a white helmet. This figure also has black hair which you can see on his face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6474-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The cockpit can sviwel full 360° and the shovel can be adjusted very easily as well. The ceiling of the cockpit can be opened and on the back of the front-end loader you can see a hook. It's a great addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
