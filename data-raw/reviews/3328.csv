Even though I had to put it away and it became disasembled over time, a lot of the parts are fun for building other things with other bricks, or just keep it together to play with. A great addition to any lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-04T07:18:12.197Z","LEGO Town (City) - Fire Fighters' Lift Truck Review","This is a fun set to have and fun to play with as well. It's also a nice addition to any LEGO city for sure. The build is very easy and lot's of fun, too. We also don't need to worry about stickers. The trailer of the truck can be removed very easily and the ceiling of the truck can be detached as well. The trailer has a hose on the back and the platform with the crane can be removed very easily as well. The platform has two stands on each side and a crane which sviwels full 360Â°. You can also move it up and down. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
