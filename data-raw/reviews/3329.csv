I brought it home opened it up and I just couldn`t bring myself to building it I dumped all the parts into my bin and cried for 2 hours.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-25T22:40:01Z","Basic and over-simplified.","I'll come clean.  I don't own this set.  My brother does, and I've urged him to get one of the older, far superior, fire stations.  The main problem with this one is that it's little more than a Junior model.  There are far too many big, pre-fabricated pieces, and practically no details to speak of.  There isn't even a ground floor.  Of course we know that older Lego buildings don't contain stairs and therefore there's no way minifigs can ascend to the first floor.  But for crying out loud leave us some illusion!  The vehicles aren't much cop either.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-07T09:45:27Z","Oh no!","I Totally agree with the previous review... this was the begining of the end in my interest in collecting lego.  Compared to the old sets this was like an after thought.  My brother and I owned a lot of the town sets, but the ones that rely stand out are those produced between '84 and '91... good ol'days.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-08T02:00:15.61Z","Bang!  Bang!  A few more nails in Lego Town's coffin there.","This is the kind of thing that made Lego Town what it is today - absolutely nothing.  It's also an example of why so many kids are losing interest in things like Lego and are buying video games instead.  Gone are the interesting, inspired designs of the 1980s fire stations.  What we have here are pre-fabricated pieces, ugly and over-simplistic designs and vehicles without doors.  There are a lot of little tools and the like, but that doesn't excuse a set designed with the notion that children will buy any old rubbish.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"xrearx","2007-10-26T16:56:04.89Z","what!","I may just be 10 years old but this is the fire station I grew up with.


I HAVE seen the classic happy faced (I love them)sets from the 80s

this may be juiniorized but 1997 one has twice the ratins

and this is far more realistic that blaze brigade 1997 fire station

today in fivth grade i was made fun of cause i liked legos and I was open minded cause i play with legos instead of video games and football sorry i got of target

but the 1997 one has better stuff in the intiror

P.S. what year were minifigures realised in 1977 or 1978.

"Berrus_Brickus","2010-12-14T15:11:18.337Z","911-High price, low piece count","<p>I got this off of Bricklink three or four years ago for $25-$30, not that bad considering that it has about 250 pieces and was originally marketed for $50 (and you complain about modern prices).&nbsp; It's basically a couple of garages with a computer on a platform above them, though the empty area on the bottom is an ideal area for expansion, I added a lounge room complete with kitchen and vending machine. Pros &amp; Cons-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong> 
<li>*Nice Minifigures 
<li>*Trike (and in red!) 
<li>*Nice blue windows 
<li>*White ladders 
<li>*Alternate Headgear for minifigures 
<li>*Yellow Bullhorns 
<li>*Easy to expand 
<li>*Fire Tracker Computer/Radio</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong> 
<li>*Firetruck is kind of plain 
<li>*Just a couple of garages and a computer (similar to recent models though) 
<li>*Horrible price ($1:20p!) 
<li>*Truck's yellow stands are floppy 
<li>*Trike's cart is kind of random 
<li>*Pavement doesn't mach up to road tiles 
<li>*Anntenae comes off and gets lost easily</li></ul>
<p>I'll leave this open to interpretation because the pros are more numerous than the cons, but I really streched out the pros.&nbsp; Anyway, if you are looking for a fire station, don't invest in this one unless you can find it at a fraction of the original price.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-05T05:17:00.72Z","LEGO Town (City) - Fire Fighters' HQ Review","This set is a great addition to any LEGO city for sure. We get lot's of cool stuff in this set, like a truck, a helicopter, a motorcycle and the headquarters. The motorcycle also has a trailer where you can see a hose and a chain saw. The trailer can be removed very easily as well. The helicopter has a hose on each side and the blades sviwel full 360°. The windscreen can be removed very easily. The truck has a stand on each side which sviwels, a hose and a ladder on the top of the hose. The ladder slides out very easily and you can also sviwel it full 360°. You're also able to remove the ceiling of this vehicle if you want to look into the cockpit. There's also a trunk on each side where you can store some stuff in there.<br><br>The main part we get in this set is the headquarters. The gates on each garage opens and we also get some tools in the middle. The lights on each garage does sviwel and one garage also has a platform for the helicopter. The office in the middle of the garage doesn't have much in the inside. We get a screen and a seat for the minifig. This set is very easy to build and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. It's also a cool set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
