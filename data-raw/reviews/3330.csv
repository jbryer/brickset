"frogstudio","2007-12-25T11:39:27.31Z","Great set","I got this set for Christmas from my girlfriend.  She found it at a small Toy shop which stocked some really old sets (consider this set has 10 years, and it was still MISB!) I loved it.  I don't find it juniorized adn the pier (the base) is great for older smaller ships.  Really nice addition to any collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-15T04:36:54.537Z","LEGO Town (Res-Q) - Emergency Response Center Review","This is a very cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers in this set to worry about. This set comes with lot's of stuff: We get a helicopter, a raft, a motorboat, a motorcycle with a trailer, a truck and the headquarters itself. The boat has a nice dashboard in the inside and some cool signal lights. There's also a place for the stretcher and a string. The helicopter has blades which sviwel full 360° and the windscreen opens very easily as well. The helicopter has a string as well. The truck has two nice cranes with a string and on each side is a container where you can put some stuff in. The ceiling opens very nice and easy, too.<br><br>The headquarters has a nice looking window piece on the front and we also get some places where you can store some stuff. There's also a lantern which looks really cool as well. On the top of the building you can find a radar which sviwels full 360° and a platform for the helicopter. In the inside is a nice office which has a sviwel chair as well. I really can't complain about this set. <br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

Although (in comparisment to the rest of the series vehicles) it's a small base, (There is no way to store a the vehicles on or near this base) it does a great job anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very nice is the waters-end pier&nbsp;(especially with the light at the end)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set comes with 4 vehicels and 5 minifgs and a multitude in tools which makes it very playable. To bad only rescuers were included and no rescuees. </p>
<p>The vehicles are nice, and realisticly sized (compared to other sets from this series).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lots of nice parts/bricks that you don't see that often. (Base plates, flat triangles, hooks and winches&nbsp;etc).</p>
