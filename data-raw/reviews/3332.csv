Putting this thing together, I immediately noticed how the bricks fit tightly together, and I mean really tight! A fairly easy set to put together but you have to be aware of the electrical pieces and how they produce different results dependent on which way you place them.

Once finished, this set is really fun to play with! The lights are great and the movement of the vehicles are superb. The color co-ordination is good (mainly yellow and black) and details are fine.

Now that I've been turned on to these cool ""Light & Sound"" sets, I'm on a mission to somehow find the others!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-12T03:27:51Z","just great!","Having just bought this set, I'm totally amazed. Also because this is my first set with light and sound elements. It works superb and looks great - not only you can light the long beams but also the milky white warning signs or combine the elements. I just love it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gladiatoring","2009-10-19T23:08:04.513Z","Construction Crew","This is one of my favorite sets in the classic construction line. Playability could not score any lower. The two minifigs have everything they need to start work. It is listed and has been reviewed as a light and sound set, but there is no sound only lights. The Dozer is almost  exactly the same as set 6658 Bulldozer.

I remember playing with this on dark winter nights with the flashing lights going. That is cool, I mean what could be better than combining the joys of light with the versatility of Lego?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p>The bulldozer is excellent, as usual it has those nice details. The bucket can easily shift the biggest of bricks in the way, there is nothing more satisfying that piling up a mound of bricks and letting this carve a path through them! It has a neat little grill using a 1x2 tile with handle and uses sloped bricks to build up the nose. The cabin has a flat windscreen, doors, sunroof, spotlights and radio antenna. The driver gets to his cab by ladders and the chassis is jointed for easy steering&nbsp;with the engine compartment at the rear. The wheels are not just chunky but have neat hubcaps too, the studs looking like wheelnuts. The rear engine compartment looks good with another ladder as a radiator at the back and a raised exhaust cone. The sloped bricks make it look quite compact and neat and the overall effect is very good. The bulldozer is very sturdy with a good tight brick fit.</p><p>The designer's had to hide the battery box somewhere. How better than to make it into a compressor trailer and as a place to carry the equipment? The trailer is pretty simple, a basic chassis which is well designed to match the bullzoer in style.&nbsp;&nbsp;The forward set of wheels is fitted to a turntable to aid steering and easy placing when reversing. It also has brake lights at the rear and a warning chevron flat 1x2 brick. The top section is the battery box with the use of an extender cable to supply power to the rear light elements. The sides have clips for the two road barriers and on the front of the trailer and on the roof is ample tool stowage. The light elements are great, one single yellow bulb on top, the two excellent roadworks signs on the back and the two big light bars.&nbsp; These stow easily on top of the barriers. The nice touch is the ability to turn the light elements to either have a constant glow or flashing lights.You can easily combine the rear light blocks into several different configurations. There is nothing better than having both bars and the top light flashing away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>One driver with blue dungarees and hair and one road worker with a printed roadworker jacket and red baseball cap. Myself I would have perfered both figures to have had the blue roadworker suits with the neat motorway logo and hardhats. Where is the health and safety advisor? The driver of Set&nbsp;6504 Tractor has one so one each for these guys would have been good. Tools include a pickaxe, shovel, axe, broom and pneumatic drill made up of a handle 1x2 tile with single stud and a cone. The drill looks pretty good. With all those tools any job can be tackled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>This set stayed intact for many years, the whole set looks great with nice proportions and good detailing and design. The battery box is nicely integrated and the trailer is very useful to stow all the gear on. This set has hours of playability, it has the ability to bring out the inner kid in all of us. Go on turn off the lights and play with this in the dark... you just have to!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
