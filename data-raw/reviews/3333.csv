The design itself is great with the side door, the monitor, the back doors, the odd cockpit, the colors, and the electric battery box. A 'must have' for any Lego collector!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The rotors fall off easily, but you can replace the tiles with the new type rotors which fit tighter, so your kids can also play with it (bet they love it too).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"PeteM","2017-03-31T17:14:59.11Z","Bib Bib Bib, Wii Wii Wiiâ€¦","<p>&hellip;That&rsquo;s the sound of da police &ndash; well the sound of the Rescue helicopter anyway, according to the instructions for this 1989 Light and Sound Legoland Town set.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and simple to follow &ndash; no piece calls outs, but then there really doesn&rsquo;t need to be. As well as the usual shots showing off the 9V features, an alternate build, and the main model about to land on an injured man, there are also a couple of pages illustrating how the electric system works. There are instructions for installing the 9 volt battery at the beginning, while post-build is a page with plenty of lens flare (because 1980s) accompanying diagrams demonstrating how rotating the orientation of the lights will change the output from alternate flashing to flashing in tandem, and how the power can be routed through special plates so the lights and the lights and sirens can be sited away from the 4x8 footprint of the battery box if required.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Even in 1989 few of the bricks were of any special interest. A good quantity of long 1x8 grey tiles was a treat and the pieces for the white stretcher had only appeared in a few other medical-themed sets to this point so was quite exciting at the time. Otherwise, there was a standard collection of red and yellow 1xn plates, white sloped bricks and other miscellaneous pieces, several of which were more familiar from vehicles in the Space theme.</p>

<p>The highlights are of course the 9 Volt Light and Sound elements &ndash; despite the system being introduced three years earlier and featuring in a number of Space and Town releases, any opportunity to add more lights and sirens to my collection was welcomed! As with other sets, the 9v battery box features unique printing, in this case displaying the aircraft registration number (co-incidentally the set number as so many of them were!) &ndash; nice as a part of the set, though somewhat limiting its utility in other creations. The siren block and light bar were standard and the latter was designed so that the bulbs could be covered by various coloured shades, of which plenty were included (and subsequently lost under sofas, up vacuum cleaners, ingested by pets etc...).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The three minifigs included all have clearly defined roles &ndash; pilot (he has a helmet), medic (he has a baseball cap) and casualty (he has no trousers). None of them seem concerned about the poor chaps lack of nether-coverings as all faces feature the classic Lego smiley used on all minifigures of the time.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build is straightforward, starting with plate stacking, followed by some brick stacking, then more plates stacking, and finally a layer of sloped bricks to form an aerodynamic fuselage (for the time). It is the plates that carry the red and yellow stripes along the length of the helicopter body and add a bit more visual interest, but overall the build lacks any particular surprises or unusual techniques.</p>

<h3>Completed Model and Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The final result is a solid and decent model, undeniably elevated by the presence of the 9V Light and Sound system. So most rescue helicopters of this size are unlikely to have working siren, but who cares when the whole thing is this much fun? There are numerous nice design touches outside of the electrics, such as low profile inverted slopes under the front section to give a more interesting profile, and that the rear wheels are steerable thanks to being mounted on turntables which adds to the manoeuvrability of the model on the ground. The engine sub build under the rear rotor blades is a good demonstration of how to evoke functionality with limited pieces and features pieces more usually found in Space sets as a spaceship engines, which work well as the rear engine/exhaust of the helicopter.</p>

<p>There are a number of features which are very much &lsquo;of their time&rsquo; &ndash; the cabin is a little perfunctory, small and open the elements on two sides, but the large front canopy provides a suitably aerodynamic covering. The fit of the stretcher in the back is snug to say the least, and securing the two back doors with just a 1x2 plate doesn&rsquo;t quite work (especially when you lose that plate which I remember doing on a regular basis). The travelling medic must sit with one arm permanently raised in order to close down the side opening properly, a limitation of the 4-stud wide standard used for aircraft then. Finally, the gull-wing side opening can get tangled in the rotor blades if you&rsquo;re not careful, often causing both the blades and the windows to fall off on my set as the clutch on the pieces has diminished over time.</p>

<p>Despite these minor flaws, this set is still a lot of fun and sits nicely in a layout featuring sets of a similar vintage. The electrics really add a new element of fun to what is already an above-standard helicopter model, being the first one based on the twin rotor &lsquo;Chinook&rsquo; design which further adds to the appeal. This set retains a striking and classy profile, even when up against more modern sets, and the (admittedly incongruous) use of the Light and Sound elements help it stand out as an engaging, fun and playable model today.</p>

"polarscribe","2013-03-13T04:48:25.78Z","A realistic, playable, well-designed classic","Out of all the wonderful 1980s and 1990s Town sets, the 6482 Rescue Helicopter has to go down as one of the best-designed and most-playable vehicles ever released.<div><br></div><div>The aircraft is modeled after a CH-47 Chinook - which, in the real world, is not used as a rescue or medevac helicopter except by military forces. However, this design decision is understandable given the inclusion of the massive Light and Sound box, which takes up fully one-third of the helicopter's fuselage. OK, sure, real rescue helicopters don't have sirens, but they do have flashing lights - and we can allow a concession or two for the ""fun"" factor.</div><div><br></div><div>Open up the side or the rear, and we find a new concept for Lego, never before seen in Legoland: a full space for a stretcher with a patient. Panels provided enough space for the stretcher to slide into the four-wide fuselage through a set of swing-open rear doors. The entire back of the helicopter opened, ingeniously enabled by the use of hinge plates and a nifty modified plate ""lock"" that held the clamshell doors closed. There was also room for a flight nurse or paramedic to ""ride along"" and monitor the patient, with the assistance of printed-tile computer equipment.</div><div><br></div><div>Hospitals and medical care have been criminally under-developed by Lego - the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6380-1"">6380 Emergency Treatment Center</a>, which was released in 1987, was the only hospital released for a span of almost two decades, and no other helicopter of the Classic Town era was designed to carry a stretcher inside. Even the otherwise-interesting <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=1896-1"">1896 Trauma Team</a> set from 1992 resorted to MASH-style external carriage - which, even then, as a 9-year-old KFOL, I could tell wasn't how the ""real"" paramedics did things. So throughout my childhood, the 6482 was a staple of my Lego city, responding to earthquakes, traffic collisions, train derailments and all the other disasters that befell it. It's a set that has stood the test of time for decades, and even today has no equal in design and realism for medevac helicopters.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
