"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-24T00:20:28.483Z","Unexpected","This set is interesting for a couple of reasons. First it is a Light and Sound set which was, I gather, a bit short lived. Secondly I was suprised in the fact that everything worked on this set. It has a little motor that turns a radar dish, makes an awful racket and lights up the flashing lights. I took the batteries out as this is a display piece on the dock of the town and did not want to ruin the battery box. Also the little turn out computer guy is a pretty nice touch but I am not sure what his function is as he is not in a police uniform. The little bad guy speed boat is kind of nice but very plain and simple in its design. If you can find this set - even if the light and sounds don't work - this is a pretty nice set for display or play as my nephew likes it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Needless to say I was very happy with this one. A nice size too, perfect for chasing down the smugglers boat.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-20T07:32:22.42Z","Clean lines and pleasing to build...","I have two of these sets; the first is almost new and still in its original box with original building instructions. This was an eBay find and I paid just under £20 for it. The second set is currently being re-furbished or re-built as I bought it again from eBay for 99p! It was a part-set but the bulk of the boat was there. The electrics and motors were missing and I do have these in my collection, somewhere, also there are other ‘special’ parts missing, so this is an on-going project boat, I tend to buy bits for it when I see them available.

I remember being a youngster and wanting this set and never getting it! By the time I asked for it for Christmas it had been discontinued. I have always thought that this was one of the more attractive sets in the boats / coast guard series and it fits perfectly scale-wise with other kits of similar size (6596/6679/6535 etc). I particularly like the simple black and white lines of the boat and coupled with the red ‘vents’ and ladders, I think it all works very well. The ‘roll-out’ platform on the rear deck is interesting, but perhaps this area could have been better used with a crane and dinghy?

The only negatives which I could associate with this set have been partly mentioned before, the noise of the radar revolving! Also I think the flying bridge (control area) is a little too high for my liking, it could possibly have been lowered slightly.

All in all a pretty good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
