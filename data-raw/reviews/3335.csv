Recently bought a used set of 6484 from e-Bay.  

I think 6484 should be one of the best model launched at that time in 1995, and it still defies most City/Town vehicles launched subsequently up to now.

This set basically has 3 parts: a hauler, a small racing car and a tool stand, plus 3 minifigs which are two engineers and a racing car driver.

The core of this set, the hauler, is a 6-stud one.  Launched in 1995, I believe it should be one of the very pioneers of 6-stud vehicle. The wider body of the vehicle allows not only housing of the electric parts, but also a much more “solid and strong” outlook which is necessary for a hauler.  

Of course the core part of this set is the 9V electric motor and lighting system, which I believe has pretty much vanished for recent City series.   With the electric motor, the crane (with a metal hook, not plastic) can be put into a very realistic movement to pull up or lower down the hook.  I believe it is strong enough to pull up most normal-scale City vehicles. As such, the motor part definitely adds tremendous playability of the set and can be very useful for creating other contruction/ utility vehicles as you like.  The supporting bar to assist raising of the crane works well to prevent any collapse.  The electric lights with red semi-transparent bricks covered gives you sparking red light effect and surely is interesting.   Printed tiles depicting meters on both side of the vehicle as well as in the cockpit make the design looks more detailed.  

Overall speaking, the color scheme is good and the design is excellent as a hauler.  You would definitely be more than happy to put this hauler in use not only for dealing with small racing carts but also for any normal auto-services in your City because, as I said, it has a much stronger crane and is reasonably bigger and heavier than other  auto-service vehicles launched in City/Town series so far so that it can handle most vehicles including even fire engines, etc.  This hauler can be easily incorporated into existing City series without looking “small or weak” and serve other City vehicles well. I will stand by 6484 as the best so far among the auto-service type vehicles.

For the small racing car, it is a tiny one without special or outstanding features, but nonetheless it is still very good looking and works with the hauler well to perfect the concept of this set.  The small tool stand gives you plenty of car repair equipments, a plus to the set.  Another noteworthy thing is that all bricks with logo are printed ones and you don’t have to bother with any stickers.  

I know the then launch price and the current market price of this set is not cheap, but taking the electric part and overall quality and playability into consideration, I still recommend this to all City series player.  Personally I would even have chosen to buy a MISB if the price is more affordable.     6484 will surely provide excellent auto-services to your city!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
