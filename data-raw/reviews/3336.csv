<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using stickers for details and a strangely limited number of pieces to make the truck there are certainly a lot of odd choices in the design of this Fire Engine. I'm not sure if the engine tows the trailer section since I'm going off the picture (I haven't had this set for a very long time.), but I would expect that a connection piece would be used to tow the trailer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is your typical Firefighter from LEGO Town, with the same black torso uniform print and the smiling Firefighters' face print. It includes a gray axe and a yellow oxygen tank along with the faceshield necessary for charging into a burning building to save the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is one I'm not sure how good it could have been, but there is definitely some potential there. It's a good small set for Firefighting enthusiasts and you can't go wrong with the pieces included in this set. I feel that it is a good addition to a burgeoning Fire section of your LEGO Town.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-09T09:28:59.803Z","LEGO Town (Fire) - Fire Engine Review","<p>This is a very nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has two instructions. One instruction is for the truck and the other one is for the trailer. Both instructions have 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For a number of 66 pieces I have to say that 10 USD are a little bit overpriced, because it is about 15 cents per piece. It would have been better if it had been about 10 cents per piece but think that we would have paid a little bit more if it was on sale today...<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set only has one minifig. The firefighter comes with a black uniform and he has a white helmet and a mask. It's a nice looking minifig. However: I like the firefighters from the LEGO City theme much more, because they've better details on the torso.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. I don't think you'll need longer than 10 minutes to build it.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6486-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The set has a nice truck and a trailer which can be removed very easily. On the back of the truck you can see a cable with a hose which you can pull out. The trailer has some water cannons on the top which sviwel full 360Â°. You can also adjust them up and/or down. There's also a place in the inside of the trailer where you can store some accessories as well. It's a good addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
