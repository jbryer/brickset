This is probably the smallest minifig-sized helicopter with a fully-enclosed cockpit that Lego has ever made, and it still manages to pack in a functional winch.
And the winch allows the chopper to bring its own accessory rack along.
Said rack is loaded with stuff: an axe, a shovel, a pickaxe, a chainsaw, 2 suitcases, a barrel of Octan fuel and I'm guessing a barrel of oil.
 
The set was really good value for the money when it first came out.
And that lil' helicopter is just so cute. :)

Great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
