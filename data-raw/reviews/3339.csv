"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-21T00:00:00Z","","I had a lot of fun with this before my ""Destruction Age"" (My mother got tired of LEGOs invading the house, and told me to take all but one or two things of my choice apart, then start over and build new things. I sadly misunderstood, and not only took the structures apart, but most of my minifigs, and wheels from tires also. My Unitron, and Ice Planet figures were never seen again. There torsos anyway, and that is what counts. I quickly re-built as much as I could.) Plenty of good parts and pieces include the grey bird, and alligator, camping equipment and tools, lots of good car pieces, and a good car if you keep it together, as well as pretty good mountain scene. One of the last sets released before the Junior Era began, and a very good one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set is medium to small, but every piece is important and gives it the charm that all sets from the early 90s possess. The truck is just cool. Love the tire suspension, the spare tire and the blue tinted sun roof. I really appreciate the box and instruction artwork of these older sets. They show exactly what the set is, no trick photography, no unnatural poses. What you see is what you get. Some of the later models tend to over dramatize the set by the cover artwork and lead you to believe it is a lot more sophisticated than it actually is. Can be a little disapointing especially for younger children who don't understand marketing tools.

If you have some more sets with rocks and landscape scene this would fit in really nicely and enhance it even more. I plan to get some more, I think it would work well with Rocky River Retreat.

Pros:
truck and cable
crocodile and skeleton remains
bridge
minifig's green outfit is nice

I love riding it over all and everything, including&nbsp;through my bed and such&nbsp;- it runs smoothly, without loosing road contact. Very clever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, it is made mostly of standard bricks rather than special-shaped pieces. This makes it one of the most valuable car sets in that era of ""quick and dirty built"" cars from late nineties. Only backside is the BURP.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

We also get an alligator. The brown pieces which LEGO uses for the bridge can be adjusted and it's big enough for the truck to pass it. The vehicle itself has a nice suspension mechanism and on the front we get a cable which you can pull out. The ceiling and the doors on each side can be opened very easily as well. On the back of the truck you can see an antenna which can be adjusted as well and there's also a place where you can put an extra tyre which comes with this set. On the top we'll find a gun and a pickaxe. What I thought was very cool is that LEGO has added a skull and some bones with this set.<br></p>

"kbcakir","2014-07-26T03:27:26.747Z","My Childhood Dream","<p>I could not get this set when I was a kid because I was too late to buy it from TRU or other local markets. I met this&nbsp;awesome &nbsp;set from the catalogs. I hardly remember getting&nbsp;my first proper Lego set in 1997 or&nbsp;1998,&nbsp;this was on the catalogs but I couldn&#39;t be able to find it anywhere. I always dreamed about the possibilities of adventures , it will offer. I remember myself feeling amazed by&nbsp;how designers added a&nbsp;gun to the inventory to poor minifig defend himself against cruel croc or any other villains in desert.Gun in a town set was not usual.&nbsp;After many years of dreaming and 5-6 years of dark age I met bricklink and finally got this in a sealed box. I opened it without hesitating I still keep its box in the&nbsp;glove compartment of my car as a lucky charm.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box look primitive when compared to current ones but present what you will get objectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With today&#39;s mind parts are not really impressive but with a very low part count it turns out a big set. You get aan awesome car a threatening croc and some rocks to perform your offroad&nbsp;skills.The starring part of the set is suspension thingy for sure. I wish they produce a modern version of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Yeah I admit he is not impressive today but, when I was a child this head with ray-ban style glasses was one of the coolest heads (I remember myself using it even for castle figures) and torso captures camel trophy soul very well indeed.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not enjoyable like today&#39;s Camper van or Parisian restaurant but getting cliffs a 4x4 and a wild beast for just 15 dollars wow I can&#39;t think about for today</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just try to drive that little jeep across, you will understand what I mean you can feel it rolls!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really wish some themes like outback and divers. I accept today lego sets are more detailed and enjoyable but they sometimes dedicate you how you live your adventures. But with these realistic sets, you can be either bad or good guy and spend your day by commiting or preventing crime, 90&#39;s has <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">atmosphere&nbsp;</span>like a GTA game, they did&nbsp;not tell you what to do or how you live. This set reminds me what I really miss about lego, maybe someday they will remember and with today&#39;s possibilities&nbsp;we will enjoy the best lego adventure ever.</p>

"TheK79_selbst","2020-08-08T02:24:28.737Z","farewell with a scull head","<p>This set was the last of the classic &ldquo;Town&rdquo; series (it&#39;s 7+ for little over 100 pieces!), being replaced in 1997 by the new Juniorised series later called &ldquo;City&rdquo;. And looking into the details, it looks like the designers wanted to say &ldquo;farewell&rdquo; with it&hellip;</p>

<p>The bridge is build like a diorama with the stones only making a thin &quot;wall&quot; in the background. And the setting is straight from the end of the world&hellip; a wobbly bridge over dangerous animals and the remains of some not so fortune traveller. It looks, as&nbsp;if he&#39;s fleeing the dying town&hellip;</p>

<p>But there is also an interesting technical aspect.&nbsp;For the first time ever, Lego used all ten non-transparent colours&nbsp;existing back then in a single set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>black for winch, Antenna, tires,&nbsp;pan and some more</li>
	<li>light grey for the stones</li>
	<li>white for the bones</li>
	<li>red for the cap and&nbsp;the fire extinguisher</li>
	<li>blue for the water</li>
	<li>yellow for most of the car</li>
	<li>green for the crocodile and the bush</li>
	<li>brown for the bridge and the backpack</li>
	<li>dark grey for hammer and rifle</li>
	<li>and for the first time ever a brick appeared in &ldquo;tan&rdquo;: the sand on both sided of the river.</li>
</ul>

"TopFloorBricks","2021-02-10T18:57:15.06Z","Amaz(on)ing!","<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>You tend to find on Brickset that rating correlates positively with set size/price and whilst this is not the largest set,&nbsp;I genuinely think this is one of the best sets LEGO have ever done. There are so many elements that make it so superb and I shall do my best in this review to narrate them to you.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The instructions tell you to build the bridge scene first, consisting of three plates to show the water and riverbanks, light grey rocks that provide the desolate looking backdrop to the scene and the eponymous wooden crossing which looks so rickety you&#39;re just asking for trouble crossing here, crocodile or no crocodile. The tan plates, rocky features and the fact the only bit of foliage is the bush really makes the scene look barren, like a location from Breaking Bad. Town sets can sometimes feel a little &#39;safe&#39;. Even when there are police chasing a criminal it tends to be done in a cartoonish way, whereas this set looks gritty and dangerous which makes it really stand out. Outback was a really cool subtheme as it added that sense of adventure to real life, believable sets.</p>

<p>The bridge is an inspired construction. It utilises the ladder pieces in an innovative way, surely what LEGO is all about. It also manages to balance looking precarious yet being structurally sound. Any journey across will be perilous as the ladders naturally wobble around yet they don&#39;t actually come apart. Thoroughly well designed and a perfect match for many LEGO vehicles, not least of all the truck.</p>

<p>The yellow colour may be arbitrary but just about everything else about the truck is just. It builds up in a detailed way from a large base and manages to&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;large without&nbsp;<em>looking</em>&nbsp;large. It&#39;s astonishing how much room there is at the back. So much room for (activities) equipment.&nbsp; I love the suspension here as well. In some vehicles&nbsp;those pieces can seem redundant but here they dovetail so nicely with the wooden bridge.</p>

<p><strong>The Features</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the minifigure. Our buddy is pretty standard, with an all green affair complemented by a red cap. Nothing flashy but a perfect match for this set. Can&#39;t be wearing anything too smart as chances are he&#39;ll have to get his hands dirty at some point! I like the choice of sunglasses face too, adds to the impression of dry, scorching heat and makes him look more like he can tough it out than a plain face.</p>

<p>He gets a lot of kit to help him out too, with a fire extinguisher, pickaxe, rucksack, frying pan and&nbsp;rifle. The latter is rare in a Town set and, as a previous reviewer pointed out, a first. Again, this adds to the serious nature of the set. There is also a camera piece but this is attached to the rear aerial. Not sure what it&#39;s doing there to be honest and actually I&#39;m not keen on the aerial part as it snaps off quite easily, not ideal when the truck is clearly meant to be very robust.&nbsp;There is ample room to store the rucksack and camera in the back of the truck and you could achieve the aerial effect by sticking a lever&nbsp;on the roof. I&#39;m not convinced with the spare tyre be stored in the back either. I feel this could be stored on a&nbsp;<a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/4488/plate-special-2-x-2-with-wheel-holder/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">4488</a>&nbsp;piece attached to the back of the truck which would be both functional and look good. You would of course have to get rid of the aerial to make room. I feel that a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-30150"">30150</a>&nbsp;piece would look good in the back, though I&#39;m not sure it had come into circulation at the time. You may have to do some slight design alterations&nbsp;to fit in in too. Nevertheless, the rucksack, camera and frying pan can easily fit loose in the back and is a better use of the space than a spare tyre.</p>

<p>The main feature of the truck is the winch at the front. They have built it efficiently, only using a grey pole with no handle to crank. Although this makes it more fiddly to use I like it&nbsp;as it adds to the rough and ready nature of the vehicle. The clip means that the winch fits securely to the bridge and can also be used in other settings.</p>

<p>The bones, skull and bird all contribute nicely to the deserty bleakness of the scene and our scaly friend can interact with said bones.</p>

<p><strong>The Play</strong></p>

<p>For such a small set with only one minifigure there is so much playability here. The classic is of course or intrepid adventurer having to winch his truck across the perilous bridge while the dangerous croc lurks in the river. The image of him precariously clambering over to fix the winch in place is excellent. The winch&#39;s versatility also would allow the truck to pull a second vehicle over the bridge if it gets struck, as long as it had something for the winch to attach too. I normally paired it with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6514-1/Trail-Ranger"">6514</a>&nbsp;as that looks hardy enough to be in the outback but not powerful enough to cross that bridge. There is also enough space for a small camp to be set up on the riverbank. Our buddy can park up his truck for the night and set up a cookfire and of&nbsp;course he has a fire extinguisher on hand if it goes wrong!</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>All in all, an absolute belter of a set. Builds good, looks good and&nbsp;plays good all without being mega expensive. The only real problem with it is the name! <em>Amazon</em> Crossing doesn&#39;t work here, as I picture jungles and swamps when I imagine the Amazon. I think this set is much more in keeping with either the American South West or, as the subtheme title suggests, central Australia. Still, when the worst thing about a set is its name, you know its a winner.</p>
