"Novelty","2008-02-16T01:13:29.25Z","Little time.","This is the smallest of the Time Cruisers set, and despite its size, it still manages to build in the feature that something moves when the vehicled is pushed along the ground.  In this case, the wheels turn the propellers on the top back of the vehicle.

Overall, the vehicle looks more like a 3-wheeled cart than a racer or scooter.  The yellow engine bits with lights makes the vehicle looks rather weird.  There's also a missing windscreen on the vehicle.  At the rear, the flames shooting out seems a bit too cliche.

Design-wise the vehicle is sturdy, but the colours seem blocky and uninspiring.  The lack of the windscreen above gives it negative points, although the use of joysticks instead of a wheel is a good touch.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

To date, it is the only series that bridges all of the current series together under one unifying force through the distribution of spare parts and over-produced items. The theme was simple: time travel. The implementation... well, let's start with the smallest set in the series.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>The amount of innovation in the Time Cruisers series was much higher than it should have been. For this little set known as the Rocket Racer, there is little room for unique features, yet there is a glaring one right on the back of this little automobile. Since it is clearly supposed to be a time machine, the two fans pointed oddly upwards spin when the car drives. This feature should not be as unique as it was and still is, since few sets have adopted anything close to this, especially in a vehicle this size. Nothing else is innovative enough to note, but the spinning fans left a lot of hope for the series.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></b></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Lack of Inspiration:&nbsp;</b>Inspiration was lacking thoroughly in this series, and this car is just another cog in that rusty wheel. The set uses light grey everywhere and it looks ugly. Random yellow jets and fans mark special features. Perhaps the only visually cool thing in this set is the twin flames shooting out the back. Overall, this set lacks any inspiration at all and appears as a MOC gone terribly wrong.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>What it Got Right:&nbsp;</b>Other than the spinning fans, which are still somewhat poorly implemented with large rounded tiles sitting visible above the wheels, there is little right about this set. I'd say the best thing is the flames, and those aren't that impressive.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b>Making this set into anything worthwhile is a joke, so suggesting improvements for it is equally a futile endeavor. Picking a more inspiring color-scheme would be a start, followed quickly by replacing the back of the car with something that looks more visually appealing than two technic plates shooting off the back of the car. Technic wheels in the back are equally ugly and in need of replacement. If this series had been released today, it would either have flopped horribly or would have been designed with much more streamlined vehicles and visually-appealing colors.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;</b>This set includes the obligatory Timmy the Time-traveller minifigure, which was virtually the same in every set he appeared in. Blue pants and a blue baseball hat, with a green torso emblazoned with ""T"" for Timmy (or Time Cruisers) in the center. Rather uninspiring. His face was unique to him and is one of the few minifigures made with a nose. The eyes are large and cartoonish and look down a bit, while he has freckles and huge eyebrows which I assume is supposed to be loose hair from his otherwise hair-free head. Overall, a good LEGO head on an uninteresting body.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>How it Compares:&nbsp;</b>This set truly has no comparison. It is bulky for a cheap set but delivers little. Today, it is not worth the effort to buy as a set and easy to buy or build from loose parts. The series as a whole would never succeed today and this set is no exception. Time Cruising may be fun for Timmy, but for everyone else it's a bit of a yawn.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit"">FINAL QUALITY SCORE: 4/10</font></b></div><p></p></div>",TRUE,2,1,3,3,4
"Krogh","2009-12-18T09:26:14.513Z","one big mess","I can't remember how i got this set, in fact, i didn't even remember that i had it, until i just stumbled on the picture here. I just assembled it now, and i was not impressed.

This set just seems like someone took a random pile of bricks, and put it together just as random. The design is ugly, the color scheme is ugly, and the flames coming out the back is just way to much. It's not detail, it's just excesive. To me, the whole thing is just something, that a 2 year old could have designed, without even trying.

The spinning propellers are a nice touch, or, at least et could have been. As mentioned, they do not work, when moving the model fast, or, when not alligned properly. So, that's not a very good thing either. The thing is sturdy enough, but i wouldn't recommend dropping it on the floor, or wait, maybe i would. It would certainly be the easiest way to disassemble the thing anyway.

In retrospect, maybe it was not that i didn't remember having this set, maybe it was, that i didn't WANT to remember having it.

The only good thing about this set, that i can think of, is, that there are a lot of special parts, wich can easily be put to much better use, elsewhere in your collection. And that is allso the only reason i give the set a 2/5.

Anyway, this was my first (and hopefully last) bad review, so don't be afraid to read my other reviews, i have just as many fond memories with Lego, as all of you. Just not with this set, hehe.

Best Regards.

"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-27T01:56:35.94Z","Rocket Racing to mediocrity...","<p>I love the idea of Time Cruisers - a little kid and a doctor travelling through time to stop the villains, the Time Twisters, from doing...something...with time.&nbsp; Maybe twisting time, however that works?&nbsp; The sets are absolutely fever dreams of design though, with multiple moving&nbsp;functions and every spare part Lego had lying around pushing into a single line of sets.&nbsp; It seems like Lego was trying to find a way to get rid of every spare part they had in their factory at one time.</p>

<p>Now the sets, for the most part, I actually really like.&nbsp; I like the design of Flying Time Cruiser using the boat hull and odd flying wings, and I had quite a good time building and reviewing the Whirling Time Warper craft with its multitude of play functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this set, the 6491 Rocket Racer, is just a little odd.&nbsp; It&#39;s the small set, the little box you would see next to the medium and large ones, possibly an impulse buy or a stocking filler.&nbsp; It would have been something that I might have been given&nbsp;as we could never really afford the bigger sets.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t find the Rocket Racer&nbsp;to be particularly complex to build at all.&nbsp; You&#39;ve got a centralised chassis piece, and the whole build is bottom to top.&nbsp; The only bit which might cause some confusion is the insertion of the yellow fan pieces, which are the main &quot;play&quot; function, as the tolerances and spacing needs to be right for it to spin correctly.</p>

<p>Once completed, it&#39;s underwhelming.&nbsp; The whole set is just grey all over.&nbsp; Grey and black and grey again.&nbsp; The accents of yellow and red&nbsp;just don&#39;t break it up enough, and it ends up looking visually uninteresting with nothing to really break up the visual image of the build.&nbsp; I feel this could be improved by replacing some parts with more colourful ones, but that&#39;s besides the point.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;the shaping on the Rocket Racer is pretty ordinary with a massive blocky tower just heaped up at the back of the build.&nbsp; It looks incredibly amateur just having all that stuff piled up in a block like that.</p>

<p>On top of that,&nbsp;I find Lego&#39;s use of &quot;flames&quot; to mark speed and exhaust to&nbsp;be very ordinary. They did this so often on cars and such and I found that it never looked good or conveyed speed in any way, shape or form.&nbsp; The flames&nbsp;are cool, just overused.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts for Rocket Racer are interesting enough, and will easily find use somewhere else in your sets and parts bin.&nbsp; The two little yellow booster things are always cool to have, and the transparent orange flames are always cool to have for fires and such.&nbsp; And for such a small set, you do get wheels, propellers, technic bars, boosters, etc.</p>

<p>Timmy is a cool little minifigue, and his freckled face is great to use in your own sets.&nbsp; The torso is also generic enough to see use in city and town layouts.&nbsp; He&#39;s also one of a few minifigures I can think of with a nose.&nbsp; But that being said, it&#39;s the same Timmy that always appears in the Time Cruisers line - nothing special about him here.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The play function here is kind of cool, I&#39;ll give Lego that.&nbsp; When you push the Rocket Racer along the ground, the propellers on the top spin by virtue of the wheels pushing the little red and black bits that hang down from the propellers.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty neat to see in action but I&#39;m not entirely sure why it&#39;s on the top of the set as you think with the name being Rocket Racer, it would be on the back to help the whole racing thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think Timmy has drawn the short end of the straw.&nbsp; He doesn&#39;t get any accessories, weapons, tools or the like.&nbsp; He doesn&#39;t have anywhere to store items nor does he have the ability to store items with no hooks or brackets.&nbsp; He doesn&#39;t really have the space to bring stuff with him back in time, which is a shame because that was a huge part of Time Cruisers, the whole costume and dress-up aspect of going back in time which can be seen in the Flying Time Vessel and the Hypno-Cruiser.</p>

<p>Usually, when I see a set like a car or a helicopter or plane, I know that a kid could definitely find new story uses for it but with this...I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; It just looks so bizarre and is so small that it hits a bit of a imagination dead end almost immediately.&nbsp; Aside from being a cool car or a small helicopter, I just don&#39;t know what a kid could make with this.&nbsp; It&#39;s a pile of blocks on wheels.&nbsp; It&#39;s just got nothing about that really screams &quot;time travel&quot;.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have any cool panels or tiles with displays or anything, or a storage compartment to keep stuff.&nbsp; The movement function is cool, but that&#39;s hardly enough.</p>

<p><b>Value for Money</b></p>

<p>This is one of those sets that gets overinflated every time I see it on eBay, simply because the seller thinks that due to it being a &quot;lesser known&quot; line, that somehow warrants it being sold at unbelievable&nbsp;prices.&nbsp;Currently, as of writing this review (27 May 2020), there are a number of listings here for this little set in Australia:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>$30.00 plus $10.00 postage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>$20.00 plus 8.95 postage</li>
	<li>$12.50 plus $8.50 postage</li>
</ul>

<p>This is absolutely ridiculous.&nbsp; I would <em>barely </em>pay $10 dollars for this set, maybe $12 at a stretch.&nbsp; Just because something is &quot;vintage&quot;&nbsp;doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s worth a lot - there are lots of old Lego sets which are, when you really look at them, pretty ordinary.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s no specialised pieces here in this set, there&#39;s no rare piece or print.&nbsp; Timmy appears in a few other sets so he&#39;s not exclusive to this little thing here.&nbsp;Similarly, just because you have the instructions, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s worth infinitely more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering &quot;Well, what should I pay for it?&quot;, I&#39;d say $10 at most.&nbsp; You can easily buy the parts for this set on Bricklink and if you see it in a bulk listing, it&#39;s worth considering.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This is easily the weakest set of the Time Cruisers line, offering little play and little imagination.&nbsp; It&#39;s sat on display now for about or month or two and it doesn&#39;t excite or engage the imagination in any way.&nbsp; If you want to collect Time Cruisers sets, or you want Timmy&#39;s minifigure, just get the Hypno Cruiser.&nbsp; There&#39;s way more parts and much more to engage you there.&nbsp; If you need to collect all the Time Cruisers sets, fair enough but otherwise, you can give this one a miss.</p>
