"Novelty","2008-02-16T01:08:54.28Z","Time Flies!","This is the smallest set to include both Scotty and the Professor and it's one of three vehicles in the Time Cruiser sub-theme.  The vehicle consists of the main vehicle and a trailer.  There is nothing special about the trailer, other than the fact that it's handy to place all the helmets and hats inside it.

The vehicle itself is a different story.  Like all other Time Cruiser and Time Twister vehicles, pushing the vehicle along activates moving parts, in this case, the helicopter blades on the top of the vehicle, and the hypnotic disks on the sides just behind the front tyres.  The vehicle may seem weird but has great design features, from the double seats and the engine assembly in front to the use of jet-engines and dragon wings in the back.  The vehicle is also rather solid, although the trailer may tend get disconnected from the main vehicle on rough play.

The end result is that this set that is well designed, despite the fact that it is built with parts from many various themes and sub-themes.  The generous use of yellow ties the entire vehicle together.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The moving parts are powered by elastic bands rather than technic links.  The caravan has oddly small wheels compared to the car.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
