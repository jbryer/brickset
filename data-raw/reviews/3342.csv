I like the mechanism where the propellor turns round and the useful cockpit pieces. I disagree with anyone who dosnt like this range because it was one of my favourite ranges because if you used your imagination, some time crusers sets and some other kinds of sets you could have lots of fun, although the &quot;Kidz&quot; of today might not enjoy this as much when they could be instantly pleased with computor games, I loved it when it came out, when I bought it at legoland. So:
 Pros: Good selection of parts, propellor and theme
 Cons: a bit bare and could have had more/better minifigs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I thought this set was great. so many different pieces, great features... this set did it for me. looking at it now, though, it just looks random and odd. the minifigs are ok, but the parts, and the selection  of parts really make the set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Chaz777","2009-04-14T10:40:49.45Z","Only threes and fours? Huh?","What do people have against this set? Why has no one given it the five it deserves? And, more importantly, why did I wait so long to get my hands on a copy?
I adore this set. It sums up the Time Cruisers theme for me, its big, bold, a bit garish but very clever in design. Anyway, it had to be a bit more 'out there', because if Lego made their time machine look anything remotely like a DeLorean they would probably get sued by Back to the Future.
OK, the set. It's one of the most interactive sets I've come across, because just pushing it along a flat surface will make things happen. The wings flap, the propellers at the back spin, the whole contraption makes a clunking mechanical sound (unintentional, but it does add to the effect), and, if you lift up the treasure chest in the control room, you can see the gears spinning quickly, which could easily be something similar to a, dare I say it, Flux Capacitor.

Aside from that, everything that looks like it should move does, the dragon arms, the dragon wings, the crossbows, the time periscope, and the whole control room can be tilted forward to reveal the command console and gearsticks.
The minifigures are nice as well, a professor and his young assistant (sound familiar?), and they also have a pet monkey, which is a fun addition. You might have noticed all the headgear from various Lego themes from the past, they all go into the translucent container behind the cab, and although it is never officially explained why these are there, its a safe bet to say that Dr Cyber and Tim use them to blend into whatever time period they end up in. I also mentioned the treasure chest, that sits just behind the control console in the control cab, and contains various artifacts; a cutlass, a flintlock, a translucent orange chainsaw blade and, bizarrely, a magic wand.
So I think that just about covers it. Some have described it as a glorified parts pack, others just a bit 'odd', but I think thats all just part of it's charm, and I can thoroughly recommend it to Lego fans of all ages. 
Oh, and sorry about all the Back to the Future references. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The smallest sets made, oddly, the most sense. They were simple time machines. But just as the&nbsp;<i>Back to the Future&nbsp;</i>DeLorean got the Mr. Fusion upgrade in the future, so the Time Cruisers vehicles and playsets got &quot;upgrades&quot; from the various places in time&nbsp;<i>it</i>&nbsp;went. Let&#39;s check out the crazy time ship just to highlight what I mean.</div>

<div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; ""><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>The so-called Flying Time Vessel merged a pirate mast and hull with airplane wings and a train canopy decorated with dragon paraphernalia. Jet boosters under the wings and an Aquanauts pipe coming off the roof of the canopy completed the ensemble. All of this was extremely innovative at the time, albeit horribly tacky. A Technic-driven assembly inside makes the wings rise and fall and a rear propeller spin as the time machine moves along a surface. While not necessarily innovative, it definitely is a nice touch. The use of a ship&#39;s hull and mast in a non-Pirates theme also is nice for those who never collected the Pirate ships due to price.</div>

Everything clashes about it, and just to avoid the clash, the ship is painted in boring tones with only yellow and red highlights. Ultimately, it fails to appear like a time machine at all and instead appears as a custom build from a 10-year-old. In fact, I think I made better time machines than this when I&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>10-years old! Mechanical aspects aside, this ship looks like a mix of too many themes with little unifying it into the Time Cruisers theme.</div>

The past and hull were unique to the Pirates series before this while the wings were difficult to come by outside of Town and Space sets. The Dragon horse-head covering was unique to the Dragon Masters series, as were the wings and dragon arms, so this was a good way to pick up those as well for kids who skipped the series. Finally, all the little accessories, from Ice Planet 2002 helmets and saws to Exploriens helmets and Castle helms, this set was great for picking up somewhat hard-to-find accessories. Heck, it even comes with a Pirates monkey and a glow-in-the-dark wizard&#39;s wand! Both were getting pretty hard to find by 1996.</div>

They are large objects but very plain, bringing down the quality of the entire set. Further improvements could have been an actual cloth or plastic ship&#39;s mast since the bare mast is pretty boring and useless as it is. Why would a time machine need a huge pole in the middle of it? The entire set could definitely use rounding to make it appear more streamline, and this is something that later series would have done and, in the terrible event that Time Cruisers ever gets rebooted, a future time traveling series will inevitably do. Streamlining was something sorely missed in Time Cruisers and LEGO today has changed course regarding that issue.</div>

Blue pants, white arms, blue baseball cap, young innocent face with wide eyes, and a green shirt with an emblazoned &quot;T&quot; in the center. Timmy was unique to the series but every set came with him, so he was not an uncommon figure by any means. This set also includes the Professor, probably a reference to Dr. Who or Dr. Brown. In any case, he appears a bit loony. He wears all white with a shirt depicting a crooked bow-tie with a pencil hanging from it by a string, and a watch in his pocket. His hair is a standard black male design. His face shows a pair of spectacles with his eyes crossed, a grayish mustache and goatee, and a normal smiley face. Definitely not a person I&#39;d like to go time traveling with. The Professor is included in all the other Time Cruisers sets except for the smallest.</div>

I picked it up while in Florida in 1997. It was a damaged box at a clearance store akin to Ross and I got it for about $20, which is good considering it retailed for $44.99. I wanted it for the ship hull mostly, and because I already had the Time Cruiser base set. I&#39;ve never regretted the purchase but this set has also not seen much light. It generally sits bagged in my closet with the rest of the Time Cruisers series. Sadly, the theme just never showed itself well and everything in it was dated to a specific time and place in LEGO history that wasn&#39;t necessarily its highest point for me. The Flying Time Vessel is no exception, and while it may get rebuilt every now and again, it definitely isn&#39;t something I&#39;d recommend others purchase unless they are trying to complete the series...which is also something I don&#39;t recommend.</div>
