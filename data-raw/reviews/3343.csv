I've been collecting since the 70's and this set has the perfect fusion of enough basic pieces to offer loads of creative possibilities, twinned with enough interesting pieces to make it fun.  Plus, if you want to make just the suggested scene, once it's made it still has plenty of play value.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"whaleyland","2012-07-18T13:38:12.573Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: A Magic Mountain Lost in Time","<p>The height of the Time Cruisers craziness was in the &quot;time lab&quot; set that established a home base for the Time Cruisers. Why Time Cruisers needed a base was never asked or answered, but it existed all the game. It&#39;s gaudy design was never repeated, and despite some interesting constructs, the set utterly failed to fit well with any theme except its own.</p>
<p><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>As a relatively cheap theme base set, the Time Lab definitely had some fun improvements over previous sets. From two barrels that could be launched from hidden catapults, to an entire cliffhouse that could rocket off of its foundation, the playability of this set was never in question. Some of its innovations included alternate uses for the boat mold used in the Pirates theme, the use of multiple rock-faces to suggest hillside, and the use of Technic pins to provide fun gimmicky props. Unfortunately, none of these innovations were really needed in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p><b>Lack of Inspiration:&nbsp;</b>Like most of the sets in the Time Cruisers series, there is a distinct lack of inspiration in this set despite it including so much. Left-over Ice Planet 2002 windows make up the left side of the base, while a cannon reminiscent of the Classic Space theme sits atop the right side of the base. Pirate-like designs dominate the center and right all on a set of watery baseplates. Most of the &quot;time machines&quot; are simple constructions with one being nothing more than a chair with four neon orange studs underneath it. The time boat is rather crude to say at best. Looking at this set all these years later, all I can think to ask is: &quot;What were they thinking?!&quot;</p>
<p><b>What it Got Right:&nbsp;</b>As with the Flying Time Vessel, this set includes a lot of components that were becoming difficult to find in 1996. A fully-detailed Dragon Masters helmet was included, as well as the Islanders chieftan&#39;s hat. A chrome sword also came with the set, as did the ever popular monkey figure. This set even included the peasant&#39;s scarf from Wolfpack and a Spaniard helmet from Pirates. The accessories were definitely nice, despite that fact that many of themes that they went with were years gone. The only time machine of the bunch that was done well was the central cliffhouse ship, which has fairly sturdy rockets at its base and is a nicely constructed, if odd, vessel. The fact that the ladder can blast away adds to the fun. The Pirate-themed house on the right of the set also was visually nice, if out of context. In fact, the entire assembly on the right and center, minus the laser canon and antenna, were well done if this were a Pirate-themed set.</p>
<p><b>Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b>The biggest improvement this set could have made was to ensure that when the set was closed (both left and right wings folded back), it appeared whole. This was not done by any stretch of the imagination. The backside of the mountaintops were fully visible and open when looking from behind, and the inside of both wings of the Time Lab could still be peered into. Roofs with a foldable hatch would have been nice and easy to do. A larger and more believable time vessel could have also been included; perhaps a large time car reminiscent of&nbsp;<i>Back to the Future</i>&nbsp;or something, because the vessels included in this set seem weak. One last improvement the set could have made was to include more contemporary accessories rather than accessories from ended series.</p>
<p><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;</b>Timmy is back with his blue pants, white sleeves, blue hat, and trademark green shirt with an emblazoned &quot;T&quot; across the front. He still has the same innocent smile surrounded by wide eyes and freckles as with his other three iterations. The loony Professor is also included, wearing all white with a pocket watch and pencil sketched on his button-up shirt. His black-haired head still shows him cross-eyed wearing glasses with gray facial hair. Joining the two Time Cruisers on this journey is a representative of the undead, a plain white skeleton with floppy arms. Also coming along is a poorly-designed robot with a unique robot head but an altogether poor build of a body. It resembles many of the other poor robot attempts of the 1990s and really requires the&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;theme to come around and clean it up in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p><b>How it Compares:&nbsp;</b>Since LEGO has yet to attempt another time traveller series, there is nothing really to compare this set to. It is certainly high in playability and, despite poorly matched accessories, it does play well with Space, Pirates, or Castle themes. Where it fits in the LEGO universe is tough to say, probably in another dimension. In any case, this set was fun when it released but in hindsight it is both an eyesore and a terrible deviation into the absurd. Avoid the Time Cruisers and their Time Lab and find some other LEGO series to fall in love with. This series, despite its potential, was a bust at best.</p>
