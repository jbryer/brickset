"Novelty","2008-02-16T01:54:06.187Z","Time's Up!","The Time Twisters were the second series of the Time Cruisers sub-theme, and like all the sets in the sub-theme, rolling the vehicle along the ground causes other parts of the vehicle to move.  The rotating propeller is one of those moving parts and it has that common with many of the other sets in this subtheme.  However, the wings actually flap and that's an interesting piece of design.

The overall look of this set is a huge propeller driven bat and the use of black and blue in this vehicle ties it in with the rest of the Time Twisters.  Most of the black parts are borrowed from the Castle Fright Knights subtheme which also features bats.

The golden Wild West/Western bugles accentuates the front of the vehicle and the long flame enamating from the propeller gives it a nice look.  At the rear of the vehicle, the use of a dragon's wing for its tail is an interesting choice.

The flapping wings causes the vehicle to be less sturdy than it could have been, but the weakest part of the vehicle is where the dragon wing forms the tail.  However, these parts are still cohesive enough under normal play conditions - it takes extreme rough play to cause the model to disintegrate.

This is another great set and is probably one of the best small sets ever.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is quite special since it is filled with specialised parts, you find two plane tails, two bats, a flame, a blade for the propeller, a dragon wing, two barrels, plastic wings with prints, poles for the wings, chrome gold horns, a bit of technic, a 4x10 (I think) plane wing, two brackets, a bunch of trans-orange parts... if you have to recycle it, it contains a lot of parts which could be used for complimenting other models. If you are looking for basic bricks and plates, this isn&#39;t the set for you, it contains hardly any of those.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Really there&#39;s not much to expect, there is only one and it&#39;s 1997 stuff (well, to be honest UFO had great figures), so no print on legs or on back, the fig kinda look like a city thug, with a piraty shoulder pad.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>it&#39;s quite a fun build, with those 2 wings that are linked&nbsp;to the&nbsp;wheels and flap when you roll it, I think most of the build is actually building the mechanical parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The wings flap and the propeller rotates when you roll it on the floor! though of course it doesn&#39;t work when you swoosh it in the air.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I dunno how much it cost now, but the RRP of 10&euro; seems decent. the set is of decent size, with more than 15cm from propeller to tail, and over 20cm of wingspan, and the technic build makes it worth the price.</p>
