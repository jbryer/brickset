I love that it includes some old Fright Knights pieces, like one of the Batlord's men and a lot of bat shields.  It even includes a bat!  I love the way the gears inside make the train bounce up and down.  I love the design and the 'spooky' feeling of the set.  My rating is definitely a ten.  Great job LEGO! Re-release this one!

It is cool how mostly all of the time twisters and time crusiers sets move while you move them, and this set does alot of moving! In the front part  the fire moves up and down. On the second part, the wings on the side move up and down, and the swirling circle swirls. And on the last part the thing the ghost stands on goes up and down.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set has alot of great pieces from the Fright Knight shields, to the ghost minifigs. The train is also very cool and the detail of this set sure gives this set its name. 5 out of 5 for a fantastic set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
