One with catalogue number 6498 and one with 6436. I think I may have gotten the other model first in a box from the shop and then got this one as a prize in a competition. Either way I have both and that's neat.

Well as you can see its a micro version of the original number one race car. Black with red and white makes a nice colour scheme and the twin exhaust looks good as well.

The driver is dressed in all white with logos on his racing jacket including the Octan logo so a sponsor or their racer I cant say. His visor is also that true deep blue which looks mad as with the white.

No complaints from me with this model, wheel size suits and the yellow steering wheel dose not affect the aesthetics at all.

Overall its a great little ripper and I'm glad I have two. For such a small model with very little parts id say this model pulls a 6/10 just for its shear brilliance and brings younger fans closer to the original racer. A must for any racing or town collection. Even good as a desk ornament :)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
