"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-31T16:04:43Z","it rocks","i really dont see why everyone hates the lego time twister and time cruiser series, to me they are the best series to come out. i think the main reason they dont like them is because they dont have a shred of imagination, because if they did they would see how truly fun and cool these sets are. now, i dont mean to judge them but that is what i think. i usually build the sets with the directions unless i have two, but if you are the kind of person who just likes to go wild with your imagination and just build whatever you can think of i also admire that, but anyway onto my review.... this set is very playable and has many cool pieces such as a fire element, a propeller, two bats, two golden bugles, two large wings, two knight jousts, a blue grill piece, a small transparent blue side piece, two barrels, a dragon wing, and the tail of a plane. another cool thing is that when you push it on the ground the wings flap and the propeller spins. all in all, a awesome set that kinda looks like a world war 2 plane transformed into some wacked out psycedelic nightmare. one last thought, i urge other legoers to reconsider their thoughts on this series.
p.s. check out the other time twisters and time cruisers sets

The wings flap up and down when you roll it across the floor. Time Cruisers theme didn't really appeal to me, it was if LEGO didn't know what to do, so they threw together alot of different color bricks and made some very strange contraptions. I got it just to have one from the &quot;theme&quot; and was really impressed. I tried to find others with appeal and stuck to this one. I recommend it if you come across one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

                            Pros.

                            Moving wings and proppeller.

"whaleyland","2014-07-29T07:04:41.247Z","LEGO as an AfterThought: Twisted Into A Knot","<p>As if the Time Cruisers hadn&#39;t gone to far already, in 1997 a group of rival &quot;bad guy&quot; time travelers showed up: the Time Twisters. Just like the Time Cruisers, they were simple in design with only two members that all looked identical. Only three sets in the subtheme were ever released, though this specific model had two variants. I had the more thorough one.</p>

<p><strong>Innovations: </strong>This little $10 model came with one of the improvements from the massive Flying Time Vessel of the previous year: wheels that, when turned, raise and lower the wings. Also like that previous set, a rubber band turned the propeller in the front of the vehicle. Since both of those were no longer new and innovated concepts, this set utterly failed to introduce anything innovative to the line or LEGOs in general. The only thing it managed to do was make a cool element cheaper for consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of Inspiration: </strong>With no innovations, this set did little in the way of inspire play. It was a clunky, ugly blue vehicle with black highlights and mismatched grey and neon orange throughout. From the double gold-chrome trumpets to the bats and single dragon wing, little in this set suggests that the driver is a bad guy except his grim expression and the color scheme. Ultimately, this set utterly failed to suggest evil or provide a motive for that evil. The promotional item that was included with this variant of the set included a &quot;time machine&quot; which was nothing more than a cheaply-made plastic mold with nothing suggesting it was LEGO anywhere on it. The Time Tunnelator could fly through it. Woo...</p>

<p><strong>What it Got Right: </strong>Very little in this set was done well but there are a few fun things to note. The wings are actually sails from the Town theme reprinted with cobwebs and spiders. They are tough plastic and rather fun. The neon orange, while gaudy, suggests fire well and makes this ship seem a bit more smokin&#39;, though not enough. The wheel-wing-propeller mechanism is copied but well applied here, though it would have made more sense to use a black rather than yellow rubber band between the axle and the propeller for aesthetics.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>First and foremost, this set should be an enclosed, or mostly enclosed&nbsp;vehicle. Who knows what kind of crap is flying through time, but this vehicle does not look safe at all. Second, black rubber band. Period. Third, this set suggests a steam-punking that it doesn&#39;t show elsewhere in the theme. Lost the barrels and brown wheels and replace them with black. Finally, the set could really be improved with the sloped pieces introduced in recent years. Yes, they were not available back then, but they could have been had LEGO been more on top of the aesthetics of its sets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure: </strong>Being one of two bad guys is tough in a universe of infinitely more good guys, but this man, codenamed &quot;BAD GUY 1&quot; is nothing to brag about or fear. First off, LEGO never even bothered with giving him a name. Second, he&#39;s wearing shoulder pauldrons, a leather jacket, and a black police cap. Clearly something got twisted in time, and I&#39;m pretty sure its his fashion sense. Finally, his face is all wrong and is directly ripped from the Westerners theme. He has a scraggly look, huge mustache, and slinty eyes and, if I&#39;m not mistaken, I think he may have accidentally just ended up time traveling after busting out of the Westerners Sheriff&#39;s Office. This guy is certainly not one to write home about.</p>

<p><strong>How it Compares: </strong>However badly I rated the Time Cruisers sets, this Time Twister set is worse still. With clunky design, a bad color scheme, and aesthetic ugliness, this set belongs in the discount bin. Unfortunately, I paid full price for it fifteen years ago. I wish I had purchased the Twisted Time Train instead. At least then I would have purchased another ghost and the other bad guy. As it is, I will remain critical of the series as a whole and this subtheme especially. Don&#39;t buy it. If you really want it, you can get the individual parts for cheaper on BrickLink. Nothing is unique here except the crappy plastic frame, and you don&#39;t want or need that.</p>
