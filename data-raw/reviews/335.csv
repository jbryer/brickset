"I_like_Lego","2009-06-06T13:43:50.437Z","Good the first time around ","I didn't buy this set my dad bought it for me it took me some time to complete it,but level 1 is hard! It took me half an hour to complete(for my 10th time) but the videos,and concept art are worth all the lightstones(you have to collect lightstones to unlock them) it was okay,and easy.I played this when i was young so i was afraid to get killed.

PROS:
.easy
.nice videos
.nice concept art
.nice how the characters can move and speak
.bonus stuff in game is nice
.scenarios are beautiful
  
CONS:
.Level 1 is hard,to hard for beginers
.the level where you chase a rakshi down lava with the mask of light is hard
.some lightstones are very hard to get
.the game will sometimes get very hard    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
