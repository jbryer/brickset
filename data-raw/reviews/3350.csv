"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-21T06:31:41.483Z","Mum's Got Wheels","When shopping is needed, this souped up go-kart can probably enter the supermarket, allowing her to grab what she needs driving around the aisles. As an independent self motivated and self funded woman of the 1980s, this car was no doubt the height of sophistication and with it she had many hilarious scrapes and adventures before putting the kids to bed.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4></div><div><ul><li>Jewellery printed top.</li></ul></div><div>This is surely someone's mum, only for the white blouse and trousers with a red bead necklace print.</div><div><br><b>Mother's Pride</b></div><div>It can only be the 1980s. In town this mum is pretty trendy, she has a brand new black sporty mini car of some sort. Or a mini MF car and a particularly small one at that. Its got loads of appeal and as the first reviewer pointed out, for some reason it lasted years in the game. She just never stops shopping, working, cooking and doing the school run.</div><div><br></div><div>This really is a rather good set. Larger building experiences have been frustratingly limiting or flawed but comparatively, this new small car design with a strange seven stud long, one piece grey chassis was well rounded and without fault. Obviously such sizes indicate an easier build.</div><div><br></div><div>The black bricks pile up on top in typical fashion; axles, plates, wheel arches and doors plus the wonderful overhanging angled plate that allowed sideways built fronts, rears among many other features since. No rear lights feature on the car which is a shame but it does not really impinge on the set.<br><div><br></div><div>The black bars are a simple safety feature that also completes the cars image. The simplicity is inherent and as a pocket money set, no more is required at all. With grey/silver grill and hubcaps, chunky yellow headlights and a smooth black length on the windscreen and the design is complete. The topless car is out for summer no doubt but thats as far as topless goes, so as not to attract the attention of the law and all those MF construction workers.</div><div><br></div><div>In comparison, the tiny modern City theme Smart car 3177 gets some low reviewer scores but not all sets are supposed to be all singing and all dancing. They can contain an affordable and clever little design with a character and loads more room for imagination and interaction. The alternative build on this showed a barbeque/ cooker and a couple of typically inferior vehicles.</div><div><br></div><div>So that covers the kids. Why get it as a TFOL or AFOL? True it may not be one to go for unless you need to reclaim your lost set or just keep as a favourite but looking at the Town range, those yellow bubble cockpit coupes and OTT 4x4s just don't match up. This is an early small chassis vehicle and is not a design that has been reused or adapted. Very original and making a stronger realistic Town character, she is a high quality addition.&nbsp;Where would you be without your mum?</div></div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,3
