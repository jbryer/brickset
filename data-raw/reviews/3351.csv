Pros:

It No Stickers. (Woo!)
It Red cockpit, open! So cool look is always having.
...and Big Baroon onto the Back Tyre!
It am Soo Fast! it roars over the floor of slats by user.

Cons:

Why is absent of front Big Baroon Tyres to nose-cone?


A delightful amusement set. classic racing lego but I am prefer to the modern colors is enjoy with added Big Baroon Tyres to car nose.

I played with this set inside, outside, while eating, while bathing and probably while sleeping. It was played with so much the minifig no longer has a face and the head become so loose it had to be blu-tacked in.</p><br><p>So obviously, my rating is hugely affected by nostalgic reasons but I think it's still a great set in its own right. For such a small set, there are instructions to build 3 or 4 models. Now that's value!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-22T05:28:38.79Z","Well Buggy Me, I Need A Number 2","Finally a single set release of a number '2' racer but it was not formula 1. Nothing wrong there except a full set of numbers was only available in larger Racing sets and so with single sets you ended up with racing cars 1-5 in wacky racers style, every car was different. Dispensing with the OCD...<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路][</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><div>The white outfitted, red helmeted driver returns with the 'S' on his chest as standard. I felt one of these blokes was enough but production was not as broad so repeat MFs were standard at this time.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Custom Cart</b></div><div>Turbo Racer is not a very accurate name, it appears more like a dirt buggy or more a turbo kart. The white bars around the front wheels are a clever use of the twin exhaust/laser gun bricks but the front wheels are a bit crummy when the back has the chunky buggy wheels. These would have worked better without the need for those bars.</div><div><br></div><div>I love these offset car base bricks that lower the driver, helping to fit the chunky MF rascals in to any vehicle without having to recline. A blue line of bodywork plates, seat bar (nice piece), steering wheel, two stud with offset circular studs (what do you call those?) and tidy red number '2' smooth plate complement the red base smartly.</div><div><br></div><div>From those clever offset circular bits adjoin the black tubes or hosing, creating the safety bars and possibly a dangerous fuel line combo? They feed in to the rear plate where two black megaphone/laser cannons are transformed upright in to an engine with small exhausts. A clever example of how diverse Lego pieces are when rotated and replaced in a different context, they become a totally different feature to the imaginative eye.</div><div><br></div><div>This racing buggy certainly wins on charm and is a favourable first set. The blue and red probably made an attractive buy which was also affordable. I believe there are better racers out there and maybe a better buggy so this is a good set but not that remarkable and not without room for improvement. Some welcome variation though in the F1 dominated subtheme.</div></div>",TRUE,2,3,2,4,2
