Heck I was only 2 years old once and had no building experience back then and didn't assemble, because my parents did that for me. And it's one of the few old sets that are still assembled. Ok I had to reconstruct it partially, but I'll make it back to the original model state some day. It's a nice, simple racecar. Back in a time, where juniorisation was miles away and where no big special parts were needed.
The minifig is just plain old style and the whole design is a litttle bit too small but realistic. Otherwise a nice set, as all other town sets from the 80s to mid 90s.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This one was my first ever minifig set back in 1990. And it's one of my few old sets that are still assembled. Ok I had to reconstruct it partially. And finally I found the last missing pieces in my LEGO bins. It's a nice, simple racecar. Back in a time, where juniorisation was miles away and where no big special parts were needed.
The minifig is just plain old style and the whole design is a litttle bit too small but realistic for LEGO reasons. Otherwise a nice set, as all other town sets from the 80s to mid 90s.

I had four cars, #2 red, #3 Blue, #4 Black, but this was the only with sponsor &quot;Shell&quot;.
The minifigure is plain Blue with a nice helmet; the construction is similar to the other races with some enhancements in the back wing.
Overall 5 from 5.

I only own a handful of sets from the late 80,s, but I really like this litte set. He fits in to LEGO City even today. All the pieces with writing on them are printed - no stickers!! The driver is solid blue top/bottom with a plain white helmet. Great small set for the late 80's.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Great example of the minimalist style of sets in the late 1980's.  This one is so much fun, it almost never gets taken apart.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I'm going through all my miscellaneous pieces to rebuild some of the sets I had in my youth, and this one was one of the first I redid. Great memories for me with this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-31T11:20:49.33Z","Pole Position","Only set 1517 is comparable in design to this vehicle and their colour schemes are different enough for you to pick your favourite if you like the Racing theme.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div>The plain blue driving outfit may be unremarkable but&nbsp;the contrasting and straight forward driver sits well with a styled white helmet that has...

"Krogh","2009-12-18T16:54:33.077Z","Back to the 80's","A simpler time, a time when bricks were bricks, and they could be used to create pretty much anything, without the need for ""custom-cast model-specific"" pieces. Why does it have to be so damn aerodynamic, with rounded, pieces that fits nowhere except the places they were designed for. After all, the definition of a Lego piece, is a universal square brick, with holes in the bottom an bumps on top, and try as they might, the Lego Co. can never chance that.

This set is a good example of what a Lego model could be, and indeed, should be. no special pieces used, but still they manage to create a mean looking, fast looking Formula racer. It doesn't have to be aerodynamic or realistic to look good, just as this set prooves.

The set itself in built around a one-piece chassis, an thus, the model is made stable, but at the same time it makes the building process unchallenging, and in fact, a bit boring....... (Damn, i bit my tongue. *note to self: Never again use the word 'boring' in relation to Lego.)

This, luckely, does not change the end product. A really nice race car to put on the race track in your Lego town. I also doubt, that these types of small models would be stable at all, if not built in this fashion. When talking stability, i think that the model is quite sturdy, with the exception of the front, and especially rear spoilers, wich fall of quite easily. This, however is the only downside i can think of on this set, and it's easy to reinforce the rear, without damaging the look.

All in all, a nice looking set, that anyone will enjoy. If your town has a race track, this set is a serious contender to the podium.

It recieves a big 4/5 from me, and if not for stability issues with the rear, it would have got a perfect score.

Best regards.

"AETerry","2011-01-25T12:42:14.433Z","Sprint Racer Review","<p>Now this set, I like far better over the Formula 1 Racer. The entire design of the car is better, given the other Race Track sets and race cars I have, this keeps with a more uniform view, especially if it's going to be Lego Stock Racing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was the first set I'd gotten, back in the day to feature the new helmets with visors that could lift up. The simple print on the torso that looks like zippers was good. The car went for function and being a race car without having to do anything to try and be more then what it should be.</p>
