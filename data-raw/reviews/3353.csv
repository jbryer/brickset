I really like this little set, it was small enough to take outside and play with, yet no small loose parts, so you had no worries as regards missing parts!

Detail wise, its got that nifty scoop on the front, a steering wheel, engine and exhaust and 2 headlights to light your way. its a fab set for pocket money and would'nt look out of place in any lego town.

It gets a well deserved 4.

Happy digging!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's small but well designed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This should probably take about five minutes to build. The chassis is built up from a 2x6 flat brick. At a first glance it looks pretty simple but there are the usual nice touches. The driver has a proper seat, the digger arms are nicely integrated into the engine section, the two cylinder bricks represent the exposed engine, it has a raised exhaust pipe, headlights and chunky tractor wheels. It looks like a tractor and the little details avoid it becoming boring. The bucket will easily shift smaller bricks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>This happy worker has red dungarees and a hardhat, a rare item then but one that keep's this chap's head safe when he's hard at work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>This set stayed intact for a long time and made several repairs to my town alongside 6481 Construction Crew. It is easy to add a towbar socket so it can tow trailiers and if you remove the bucket you have a tractor. A useful little vehicle. </p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-30T07:33:40.637Z","True Blue Tractor","Is it my imagination or is this blue truer than earlier blue bricks that had too much cyan in them? Either way I prefer this blue and it makes a neat little tractor.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>A colour co-ordinated worker.</li></ul>In red dungarees and hard hat, very suitable.</div><div><br><div><b>Can You Dig It?</b></div></div><div>This short and sweet simple build is a good little pocket money set. There's little to criticise about it and it builds well with larger and smaller white stud hub capped wheels (what could you build on the side of wheels that was of any use?). The twin circular headlights look cute but I found the later opaque white/transparent ones preferable to the yellow. Twin grey cyclinders provide some semblance of an engine while a&nbsp;black cone makes a mini exhaust. The digger arms reliably clip on and hold the blue bucket for sound action in games and the driver can 'control' this from a blue seat completing a well designed little works or farm vehicle.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a good all round little vehicle and minifigure colourful combo that will be loved by small children particularly. Mini vehicles are very collectable and vary quite a bit, with many to choose you can find a couple you will like but Town mini sets in general often provide better models than simply vehicles. Its good fun searching the range, happy digging.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"T79","2014-07-11T11:07:31.78Z","Farm tractor? Or blue construction vehicle?","<p>A) having no farm or other farm-related sets, and</p>

<p>B) being eternally short on construction vehicles</p>

<p>this was a choice with an easy solution for us back then, and it&#39;s always been used next to e.g.&nbsp;#6652 Construction Truck and later&nbsp;#6507 Mini&nbsp;Dumper since.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A small, simple, folding sheet which guides you through the 20-something pieces in 7 steps, which is quite a lot for so few pieces. I guess otherwise the length of the build looked way too short... There are some alternative designs too, but they are of questionable quality as could be expected with only so few pieces to work with: a tiny drag-like racer and the best one: the almost exact same tractor but this time with the big wheels in front!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Well, you can use them to make a tractor... The blue excavator bucket is&nbsp;rare and the only one&nbsp;we had in that colour. The white wheels in this set were only around for a few years and, according to Peeron, where only found in 16 sets, a <em>huge</em> difference with the red ones who are found in countless sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A red coverall and hard hat, hurray (we never had enough hard hats)! Another point in favour of the construction vehicle theory.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Take a plate, place a&nbsp;seat, steering wheel and some bricks on there, a few more plates and wheels and voil&agrave;, done. Though with some more parts from your collection you can easily create duplicates with different functions: without bucket, with hitch for carriages, with bigger wheels etc.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s easily recognizable as a small tractor, and the excavator bucket adds some extra play value (something to scoop up would be nice but in these small sets can hardly be expected). The blue colour scheme is also something that sets it apart from the other yellow and red ones that were around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Simple and sweet, while it won&#39;t be missed if not around it it is still liked by the next generation!</p>
