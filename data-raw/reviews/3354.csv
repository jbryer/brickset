"Paski","2010-02-09T12:57:52.42Z","At the bottom-end of the Fire Chief series.","Easily the town set with the least appeal of 1988 overall. It probably only exists for people who did not wish to spend money on the much cooler 6643 Fire Chief's Truck from the same year.

No fire emblem, no chair, no radio, not even.. anything, to put in the minifig's hands.

Its predecessor 6612 from 1986 wasn't very good either, but the older 6611 Fire Chief's Car from 1981 is much cuter. 

So, if you want an old Fire Chief's Car, you should get the 6611. If you want a newer set, you are better off with 6407 or most likely the to-be-released-this-year 30010. 

2/5 because it still could be worse. But overall not recommended.

To build this only takes a few minutes. Is it practical? Well, the Fire Chief can run between stations or race round town checking up on his men, but it has no radio antenna or ability to stow any gear. At a push you could put an axe in the holes on the roll bar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Figure</strong></p><p>A standard Lego fireman with printed tunic and white helmet. I love this helmets, so old fashioned and very European in appearance. But he looks like all the others, so&nbsp;how do you know he's the Chief?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>Feeling sorry for my poor Chief I gave him some epaulets donated from a suprlus Captain Roger pirate figure. You can easily make this vehicle into a snazzy little jeep for trendy guys to race round town by removing the blue lights. It's easy to copy in different colours too. Even so, for playability the 6643 Fire Chief Truck makes this look a little dull.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
