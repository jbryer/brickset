"Loop","2008-01-29T08:30:56.123Z","Great set!","Wow, I can't believe this set hasn't been reviewed yet!

This set was the first one in my collection. Truly a classic - the one brick+wheels undercarriage, real close-open doors of the car, minifig with policeman hat and a beautiful original grinning face. 

The set is small, but the design of the car is decent. Nothing spectacular, but very nice and it looks very good - finished and ready to play. If you want to see a badly designed small police vehicle take a look at 1610. 

I really loved the small front brick with the printed POLICE sign. I used it a lot with my many other police sets. Good addition. 

And the minifig is great of course. If somebody likes to build up a big police department in Lego Town, this was a good choice. Good value for the small price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2009-12-18T14:19:12.437Z","Halt! This is the police, step out of the car!","This was one of the very first sets that i got, and most likely the first police set i got. I liked it very much back then, it was a fast, compact police speedster, that would catch the thieves when all other police vehicles were to big, or to slow. I still like the set, mostly because i have fond memories of playing with it.

Looking back on it now, it's a bit of an oddity. When would the police ever need a small cabriolet? With a roll bar no less. And another thing, it has front lights, it even has sirens, but, there are no tail lights, and that's just weird. When you look at it from the back, it looks like there no room to fit the lights. Not to worry though, it can be modified easily, if your'e in to that kind of thing. 
Who needs tail lights anyway, right? I mean, the Police should have plenty of lights on the roof alone. Or something like that. A Lego designer's logic isn't always that logical, hehe.

But back to the matter at hand. It's build on a one piece chassis, and there are not many part's, so it's a simple build. It's stability can be an issue, the roll bar falls of easily during play, and seeing as there's no roof, there's no reinforcement, so it can be a bit flimsy at times The one-piece chassis definetly helps stabilize the construction. The best part of the set, is no doubt the little sign on the hood, that has ""POLICE"" printed on it. 
The minifig is excellent, classic policeman with his hat, and that's it. No fuzz, just a classic minifig at it's best.

It's a fun little set, that has it's flaws. But looking through the eyes of a child, it's just cool as allhell, and so, i revert myself back to a childlike state, as i give the set it's final grade. 4/5.

Best Regards.

I tend to buy only the super large ones and occasionally need cars and trucks to compliment them. Lego has rarely had a ""bad"" set. However, this one comes close. In my opinion, this set only is slightly better than the convertible fire trucks Lego brought out in the 80s. And it is certainly better than the late 90s joke of juniorized sets. But that's about it. <br><br>This set is not a police car. It's a golf cart. It was puny in a 1980s Legoland town and it is especially puny now compared to the more modern sets. Any criminal over the age of 4 would laugh if he saw an officer driving through his town with this. This is something a police officer may drive on a sidewalk! <br><br>But to be fair, we have to consider the time period. Although the 80s were the Lego glory years, many cars unfortunately had this similar golf-cart set up. The race cars were fine as they looked a little more realistic; or maybe used as go-karts. A police car? Not so much. But it was common. Also, this was a cheap way at the time for kids like me under 10 to get a nice police officer for our towns. It was only $2 and poor kids as me could easily buy one. That was really the intent of Lego, here. They always bring out these super small sets for younger kids to enjoy. That's fine. It's a toy. But this is certainly stretching what I at least would have wanted a police car to be. Even then when I was young. I remember being very disappointed. This set will never be built by me again... unless I want to show my kids how mediocre even Lego could be in the 80s. <br><br>BTW, Lego still has really yet to produce a decent police car have they? But this one is one of the worst. <br>",TRUE,2,3,1,2,2

By this observation, one would hope for some more variant designs but here we are in a sunny town with the tops down on cars, including the Chief who gets a nifty ride in this zippy little sports car. The alternate catalogue descriptions often pointed out that a set based character and this is an example.</div><div><br></div><div>There is nothing wrong with this design by the way and it is a popular small build to keep around for driving from Police Station to Police Station... to Police Station. Once you got hooked on collecting them, you needed such a character as this to be an overall Police Chief and command the whole lot with the convenient use of a special car. When you got too many of these, then you started breaking down ranks; Chief Superintendent, Chief Constable, Captain, Sergeant and so on. Far too many! Some of us have to pick the favourite sets and sell on.</div><div><br></div><div>It looks neat and zippy. The simple Police plate on the front (loved these bits) and the circular blue lights on a white plate certainly make a very good finish on the clean white all over vehicle. The one bit of black sits right at the back in the form of a bar for protection, 6501 seemed to have it better place directly behind the driver seat but not a real issue.</div><div><br></div><div>The set is a good variant choice in the sub theme, an obvious favourite and great for kids. It seems just slightly a shame that the short chassis design was not extended to make the dinky enclosed mini minifigure cars that become possible by adding one stud's length each end. This better encloses the wheels before encasing the drivers with two windshields and a roof, really squashing them in to some really amusing designs, still with opening doors.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cop Car Chases</b></div><div>We made a few small alleyways for chases and atmosphere. Car chases often ripped through these scattering brick rubbish and all sorts. Cars this small and the go-kart and lawnmower grade MF vehicles really helped here as they could fit anywhere! Besides being an excellent nostalgic set, I would give higher marks to some other Police vehicles, such as the full size squad car and can also imagine a more rounded and complete small four stud chassis design.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,2
"AETerry","2011-01-24T19:18:06.777Z","Precinct Cruister Review","<p>Wow, I guess between <a title=""View full details of set 6384: Police Station"" href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6384-1""><strong><font color=""#4667a4"" size=""2"">6384</font></strong></a> Police Station and <a title=""View full details of set 6354: Pursuit Squad"" href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6354-1""><strong><font color=""#51abff"" size=""2"">6354</font></strong></a> Pursuit Squad, I didn't feel much of a need to pick up other Police sets and cars from the old Town themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a simple and small car build with a police officer. If you've got a Police Station, this set adds one more patrol car to it and that can be out patrolling your Lego Streets, keeping them safe. There are little side doors that open and steering wheel. Blue lights and a printed plate that help identify this as a Police vehicle.</p><p>As a kid, this set served as an excellent model to work form when creating other vehicles for my LEGO Town and creating MOCs.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise the set doesn't pretend to be anything more then what it is and it is truly a simple and honest build. It's greatest value came from it's pricing and size as a smaller set from when it originally came out. Either as a small gift, stocking stuffer or set that a kid can save up money for to get. Granted now days, nearly 20 years later this set is likely to be found on-line through e-bay and marked up beyond it's initial price of $2.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5
"James83","2017-08-24T14:29:42.467Z","Cop Chase!","<p>This was my first Lego police car so held a special place in my collection. Yes its basic and small but that doesn&#39;t detract from the fun you can have with it.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty basic but sound car. The chassis brick underpins a pretty neat open-top sporty car. You get headlights and a front grill but no rear lights. There is a roll bar on the back and on top of the windscreen are two blue lights, nicely sitting on a 1x4 white brick rather than just on the windscreen itself. One the bonnet is a printed Police brick.&nbsp;It&#39;s a pity the doors weren&#39;t the printed Police ones used on previous sets (6681 Police Van, 6623 Police Car and the van with the 6386 Police Station), it was an older piece but it was brought back for the 6540 Pier Police in 1991 so could have been used here to finish off the design. There is nothing wrong at all with the basic design but as pointed out by others its not the most macho of chase vehicles and if it rains the policeman gets wet on his neighbourhood patrols!</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>PC Plod is pretty standard with this set, black Police blazer torso, black trousers and a white cap. He comes without any accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This is perfect little runabout car, if you don&#39;t want a police car simply take off the lights and Police brick and you have a neat sportster. If you have other base plates you can make clones of this in different colours too.&nbsp;I made a few changes to mine, adding another bracket on the back for brake lights and later building out the rear by 1x brick to allow a basic roof brick to fit (basically creating the police car in the 6540 Pier Police Set, which you could argue is the car this set could/should have been). So while this is a basic set there is nothing to stop you having lots of fun chasing the bad guys around your Lego town, or if you already have too many police cars, adding another car to your town.</p>
