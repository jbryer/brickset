so heres the review.

Hot scorcher-this racer is like a formula 1 car. its got a sleed design and nice brite colors. the figure is also cool. he isnt small and his head is a ninjas head. it came with lots of yellow and orange pieces and apull back motor. the moter didnt go very fast but it went very far.
10/10

red bullet-this racer is small and has one of those mini-bodys. i thought the face was silly and the car was cool though. it came with some extra pieces to build other cars shown on the manuel. the moter didnt go very far though. 9/10

its a good set even if you just want hot scorcher because you get free pieces. 9.5/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
