This little mini dumper is a neat figure. The model is 26 pieces big with a cute little tray at the front which actually tilts to empty its contents. The colour scheme is classic yellow and black with the old school wheels from the era made up of the old space wheels, 1x1 round yellow studs and cross/ split pin.

The mini-fig is classic worker dressed in blue overalls and a white undershirt and a red hard hat. The face is the standard classic.

Overall this model is just classic. It hold that 80's theme so well and like the title implies it's like a real wheelbarrow. With good aesthetics for it's day and very cheap you couldn't pass it up. Playability is low but it always is with smaller models. I feel this model is a 5/10 or Average. I would say it is an excellent addition to any LEGO town.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-04T16:16:02.81Z","Tea Break!","The blue fatigued happy workmen in the red hard hats were a staple working population of Town. If you needed to build a new set or create your own new model, the actual layout where you wished to build could be transformed in to a construction site. The workmen could surround it in minutes, making a busy scene of builders and activity while machines toiled away. Left unattended or overnight and you could return to discover your building had followed new blueprints, suffered partial unscheduled demolition or been deserted in favour of the local cafe. This raises the ridiculous and paranoid question:<div><i>What do your minifigures get up to when your back is turned?</i></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Dungarees.</li></ul>New uniform! From 1985 they started getting these new prints and remained mainly blue with a red hard hat like this guy.&nbsp;The old blue top was better with the fantastic shirt print and they were all still free of health and safety and the fluorescent gear that comes with it.</div><div><br><div><b>Dumping Bricks</b></div></div><div>A quick mention of the box backgrounds. I always liked the suggestion of a landscape as in the picture above. The Lego Group obviously could make some simple coloured card and graphics to achieve this and this box gets a sort of quarry conveyor belt chute having dumped what seems an enormous pile of material. Probably for a giant MOC.</div><div><br></div><div>Back to the model. This had a brilliant yellow bucket, a really good one piece and a small tipper element for it to 'dump' out of. The model is obviously small. I boosted the part rating up a notch for the bucket and the return of the beloved buggy wheels. Desirably chunky... if thats your thing. Some clever clogs worked out that they could put mini hubcaps into them by simply reversing the circular one stud backwards in to the middle hole. Looks great and incidentally the older Space buggy tyres had a cross instead of a hole did they not?</div><div><br></div><div><b>Dumped</b></div><div>The black chassis and yellow body is a simple but happy build and the result is quite simply a favourite but one of very few decent dumpers if I'm not mistaken. This model is staying in the collection as a Construction favourite, it does what it says on the tin and is faithful to the subtheme ethos.
