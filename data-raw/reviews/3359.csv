"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-29T04:43:05Z","Good small boat","This boat is good. It has one of the old livevests, that I really like. 
The boat is some kind of a very small catamaran for races. One odd thing is, that it's got a propellor instead of a real motor. So it kinda looks like a swamp boat, like those found in the everglades. The minifigure is plain old smilie style, like in most sets between 1978 and 1993.
The whole set deserves an solid 8/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I think it was the colour scheme of the white topped with blue that made it one of my favourites. The model itself is quite a cool classic. Nice shape, Good detail for a small model.

As someone else pointed out, it has a propeller instead of a motor but it suits this model and adds to its charm. The fig is solid red with a life jacket new school helmet and the standard face. Really Nothing to complain about here.

Overall I give this model a 7/10 because its just such a good little model. An ideal addition to any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The propeller does give one the feeling that this was intended for use in the Glades, nevertheless it’s a great addition to the marina, and if you have more than one then it’s time for a race!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p><strong>Minifigures: [&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong><br />
The advent of the incredible chunky lifejacket!</p>

<p><strong>Sea Spray</strong><br />
This colourful and fun small build is a satisfying and neat build and indeed collectable. The sporty and bouyancy aided driver or pilot is at the helm of a powerful yet small speed boat that has an air turbine for power.</p>

<p>Small models such as these with flat bases slide around nicely and fulfill a lot of play and invention for water and sea themed layouts. A great pocket money kit and worthy as a classic lifejacket set. Numbered for racing, the&nbsp;option is there to&nbsp;to make sequential opponents&nbsp;for a duel at high speed. Without enough blue plastic bases, a blue cloth will always suffice.<br />

"AETerry","2011-01-31T14:22:18.46Z","Wave Racer Review","<p>I never really cared for this set, it'd have been better or fine I think if Lego had done more sets involving boat racing and other boats of this size with different numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it is, at the time, I had grabbed this set for the #2 slanted tile piece and the intention of taking one of my other race cars to make it a #2 when creating my own Race Car track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For it's original purposes and intent, it's a good little design, just that with Lego not having done more Race Boats and sets, this ultimately ends up feeling out of place in my City/Town collection. Good color scheme, minifigure wearing a life jacket, helmet with visor. There needed to be more sets like it.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
