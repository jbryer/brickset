The only downside is R2-D2's little front wheel sucks hard to build and make work, and I had to go back the next day and fix it (once again getting paid).  But if you like the Technic pieces and Star Wars, and like a challenge, this set is great fun.  Especially with a seven and nine year old watching cartoons in the same room.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
