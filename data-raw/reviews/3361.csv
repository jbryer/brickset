It has basically the same design as 6503, but it's back isn't that nice. And it's a bit too small. The Minfig has the classic smile, but with a hollow stud as all sets after 1990. There are slightly better details, like the backside, but it hasn't the nostalgic charme of the older 6503 F1 Racer. Otherwise a very nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-01T11:09:12.02Z","Mine Goes Faster Mr. Bond, Cuz Mines a Red One","This is a great little racer one of my first few racers. It embodies the classic design of the racing car. Sloping front, small lightweight, spoiler and a mammoth exhaust. The car itself seems very low to the ground which really ads to the feel that they were thinking aerodynamically.

The red/ white colour scheme makes you think of fire department but really we all know red ones go faster. (This could just be an Aussie joke so for all those tilting your head Google &quot;Kevin Bloody Wilson&quot; and I'm sure you'll get it)

The back dose seem to be missing something but this is part of its charm. The racer it's self is plain face but has the new style helmet that is more aesthetically pleasing. Full white racing suit with a red and black strip and the small S logo. Unsure of what that represents, I always assumed &quot;sports&quot;.

Overall I really enjoyed this model as a kid and to build so im going with an 8/10. Another model that captures the classic size, colours and limited pieces of the old days. A nice addition to any collector. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

We got it at Legoland in Denmark back in the day, and I loved that thing! I recently found my old Lego at my parents&#39; house and was able to build it again after ordering a few missing pieces.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Sadly, I no longer have the box or the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty basic, though I do like the yellow grates contrasting with the black engine. I remember thinking that the blue visor was awesome as a kid.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure was great for the time. Truly a classic with the white jumpsuit and the blue visor!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is easy and quick.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just like the minifig, the completed model has a classic look that I love. I prefer it to all of my other small&nbsp;car models, which are mostly Creator, even though those are great as well. It has a lot of play potential, and the spoiler can be moved up and down. The color scheme is also classic.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even though it&#39;s probably due to nostalgia, the Red Devil Racer is probably still my favorite set to this day! A great buy if you can find one for a decent price!</p>
