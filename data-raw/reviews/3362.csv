"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-06T16:11:29Z","My Very First Lego Set.","My grandmother purchased this set for me when I was approximately four years old in 1992. My parents, fearing I would eat the pieces, kept it disassembled and locked away from me for another year and a half, when I rediscovered it in a cabinet. It was a pivotal momment in my life; this toy, the Mud Runner, would determine the course of my childhood up to this point. The magic of the Lego brick was revealed to me, and I was not letting go.

Of course, looking back at the set now (I still have it), nostalgia blurs some obvious flaws in the set. Because it is so small, there are no conventional &quot;bricks.&quot; All are specialty parts. The vehicle in itself is a bit prepostorous, and doesn't look right with space for only one driver (I accept this fact for all other Lego cars though, strange). Therefore, it is a great way to get some spare parts for other creations.

But the good things about this set were many. For a kid living in an apartment at the time, it was fun to race around the house. Plus, my over-active imagination allowed me to create many different cars from just those pieces (just like they promote on the back of the box). The biggest thing for me though was seeing all the other great Lego sets, like the Intercontinental Seaport and Airport Monorail, in the advertisement sheet that came with the set. That convinced me that more of these great sets existed, and with them, who knew what I could create? Sadly, I played so much with it that the two white hammer-n-clip pieces cracked and broke at the clip, so I had to leave the set disassembled for a long time. Eventually, I found the replacement parts, and it now looks better than ever. Oh, and the minifig, while plain, is good too. I like the color blue.

It was very inspiring to child of my age. I will never forget that set. It may not be one to hunt down to add to your collection or the greatest example of Town sets, but it is a good way to know about the magic of Lego. Therefore, I give it a seven for playability and partly out of nostalgia.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The only problem that the white clip on pieses broke, and I had to redesign it a little bit... tooked the lights and put in the tail wings place, looks OK.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-05T11:49:25.53Z","Mud Runner Review","<p>For it's day, the Mud Runner made for a decent little racer and impulse buy or a cheap enough set that a child could pick up after saving their money and allowances. This set is especially good if you're wanting a bunch of race cars. It comes with one minifigure who drives the Mud Runner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design and build are fairly straight forward and unique. There are a lot of unique and specialty parts in it so you won't have much to do with it when trying to pull it apart to make other MOCs. However, it's uniqueness allows for using this design as a template on which to make other Mud Runners and create a race scene using them.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5

The printed number 2x2 flat plate looks good and the black and yellow theme carries on over the vehicle. The two headlights are ingeniously mounted on the frame and there is a spoiler at the back. I found the spoiler a bit flimsy though. There is also a vent brick for the engine and two yellow round bricks form the impression of the rear suspension. The wheels a nice combination of small and chunky rear wheels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>The driver has blue trousers and a blue top with white sleeves. The helmet is blue with a blue visor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>I never broke this vehicle up and had much fun playing cross country races with it. It was a basic, but very well designed buggy and if anyone wants to make up a set of cross-country racers then I'd recommend them to add this set to their collection. </p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,3
