<p>When Beaker ask this final question, my life was change forever. Since this time I have wanted&nbsp;his LEGO minifigure.</p>

<p>And now - I have it.</p>

<p>Building experience is exactly what you expect - simple connecting parts of the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts are Beaker parts. It means - the best parts!</p>

<p>Playability is limitless. Sometimes I imagine he says &quot;Meep. Meep. Meep.&quot; But sometimes he is in a bad mood and just says &quot;Meep. Meep. Meep.&quot;. It&#39;s a true brick friend!</p>

MEEP!","<p>If you&#39;ve read my review of Bunsen, also from this series, then you know there&#39;s a running joke that my friend and I are Bunsen and Beaker. So of course, I had to get Beaker to go with Bunsen. Beaker is quite similar to Bunsen, with the main difference being the legs and head. He has another great torso print that can be used for generic scientists, which goes for the legs as well. The head, however, is completely unique and wonderful. I love the goofiness and how well LEGO captured his look. Overall, another great minifigure that is a great addition to any collection, especially if you&#39;re a Muppets or science fan.</p>
