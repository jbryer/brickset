<p>Gonzo, (whatever he is), is an icon of The Muppet name and had to be in this series. But he somewhat expectedly wasn&#39;t alone.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a dual moulded and new head depicting his long and crooked nose protruding also&nbsp;with his eyes&nbsp;printed, the torso depicts his secondary iconic getup, his&nbsp;chilli pepper shirt with&nbsp;the design also on the arms, and finally he has very detailed mid-legs with feet and side printing to boot.</p>

<p>The Side-Character-</p>

<p>Gonzo is well-known for his romance with Camilla, the Chicken, she is the typical chicken piece with her Muppet face printed, and her&nbsp;distinguishable blue eyeliner is also present. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In Conclusion-</p>

<p>Gonzo isn&#39;t a bad figure by any means at all, but I believe a different variant would&#39;ve better suited the series. His cannonball outfit is a lot more interesting to me, and I think with that he would&#39;ve lived up to his infamous title,&nbsp;&#39;Gonzo The Great&#39;. Camilla and the figure still remain excellent, but I still think a variant would&#39;ve been better, but I still highly recommend this figure.&nbsp;</p>
