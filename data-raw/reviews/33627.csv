<p><br />
Kermit The Frog has been a pop culture icon I, and many others, have wanted in LEGO form for a very long time. And with the release of The Muppets CMF series last month, we got Kermit in his amphibian glory.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>Kermit is entirely lime green, which is appropriate,&nbsp;also he&nbsp;inevitably has a unique&nbsp;moulded head, with his eyes and open mouth printed, his torso has his characteristic spring green collar, and his legs are appropriately unprinted in the mid-leg form, which may&#39;ve been more accurate with short legs but mid-legs work nonetheless.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Accessories-</p>

<p>Kermit is accompanied by his banjo, a new piece in silver with decoration on its face. Surprisingly, he also comes with a 1x2x1 white curved title with a rainbow printed, of course being a reference to his famous &#39;Rainbow Connection&#39; song. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>Kermit The Frog was an absolute figure for a Muppets Minifigure series and his execution is flawless in design. Nothing is absent, and there is no waste. With these very positive thoughts in mind, I highly recommend Kermit The Frog to all LEGO fans, as he will most likely increase rapidly in price after the series has run its course, much like figures from the Disney series&#39;, so get him as soon as you can if you want him.</p>

For starters, the neck is a lot thinner than it should be, but it is likely for stability. I personally think it would look a lot better if it was thicker or absent altogether, as well as if the sides of the head were widened just a little. Additionally, I&rsquo;m sure that the printing quality may vary between different characters, but from most of what I&rsquo;ve seen, the red of Kermit&rsquo;s mouth cuts off a bit too early, leaving a noticeable gap that is most visible from the front. Regardless of these issues, I am still grateful that a Kermit minifigure finally exists, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see all the cursed material and meme recreations using this minifigure.</span></span></p>

"Pollywanna","2023-02-03T21:42:34.403Z","Lovely, but could be better","<p>I&#39;d given up on getting the Muppets CMFs - despite a LEGO Kermit being something I&#39;ve wanted ever since I was a kid, thanks to the Kermit-esque heads of the Life on Mars figures - until I stumbled upon a box full of them in a FNAC in downtown Toulouse, in February of 2023, almost a year after they originally released! No other CMF series in the store, just these poor abandoned Muppets.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I felt for Kermit immediately and, after finding the banjo, practically ran to the checkout, not fully believing my luck. He&#39;s a great figure, and I&#39;m really glad I got my hands on him at last, although there&#39;s a couple of disappointments.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m happy with the body proportions being off, it&#39;s a minifigure after all, but I&#39;m not happy with the production quality on the head - the eyes are just painted, and they really could have been dual-moulded, like the eyes on the Looney Tunes Daffy Duck CMF, or the hair on the Miss Piggy CMF, I really think it would have resulted in a cleaner, less sloppy look, and while I can excuse that with lesser characters in the wave, Kermit is *the* muppet, and I think he really deserved a little extra expense.<br />
<br />
A smaller thing is the collar - I almost want a fabric collar accessory instead of the print, but I&#39;m not sure how much better it would actually look. The accessories he does come with are great - the banjo is an unexpected treat, a brand new mould with a great print, and the tiny rainbow is entirely too cute, and not at all necessary to round him out.<br />
<br />
Overall, he&#39;s a great little figure, and definitely the one to get if you can only get one Muppet.</p>

"Th3_3m3rald_M1n3cart","2023-02-23T02:30:54.8Z","Why are there so many, songs about rainbows?","<p>THE MEMES! For so many years we&#39;ve been begging LEGO to give into to the memes and make Kermit. AND WE HAVE HIM! But not just a LEGO Kermit, a LEGO Kermit that excels. He&#39;s got torso printing that is simple, but executes what it needs phenomenally. But the new head mould, like most other Muppets minifigures, steals the show. I loved the expression, the mouth, and especially the shape. But his accessories are also great. He has a banjo which is one hundred percent necessary. He also has a curved tile with a rainbow which is also a hundred percent necessary. Overall, definitely one of the best minifigures of 2022 and all time. I one hundred percent recommend no matter what. Every citizen of the world should own this minifigure and we should institute regular checks of every house to make sure people have their Kermit on hands at all times.</p>
