<p>Miss Piggy is another immensely iconic member of The Muppets ensemble, and she is perfect in her Minifigure form.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>Her head is dual moulded with eye printing and flowing blonde hair, her torso and legs depict an intricate and brilliant dress design in pink, with the design continuing to the sides of the legs (which are dual moulded), and her arms are also dual moulded representing her lavender cloves with slight print decoration on them.</p>

<p>The Accessory-</p>

<p>Her singular accessory is a 2x3 white tile, with a printed poster of herself on it, of course eluding to her vain and self-indulgent attitude that she is famous for. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In Conclusion:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I (much like with Kermit) highly recommend this Minifigure to all LEGO fans. You can tell how much effort was put into the sculpt of her head, and the print of her dress. Accuracy was clearly at the forefront of the designers mind. Identical to what I said about Kermit, but I highly recommend buying it soon if you want, as these figures will most likely skyrocket in price when the release window closes.&nbsp;</p>

Having found Kermit in a store almost a year after their release, I felt the need to go back the next day to pick her up, just to complement him, and she looks much better than I expected.<br />
<br />
The dress is printed beautifully, with a lot of little metallic pink details and silver sparkles that don&#39;t show up well in most photos, and with the flesh tone, it&#39;s a really versatile outfit that could be used for any starlet. The head also captures her look really well, with the big hair, the face that&#39;s so accurate you&#39;re almost fooled into thinking it&#39;ll be soft like a Muppet, not hard like a minifig, and nice eye printing that gives her some attitude.<br />
<br />
The sole accessory is a poster of herself, which is cute but a little disappointing considering the accessories some other figures come with, but I&#39;m not really sure what else would have been appropriate for her. A Friends hand mirror maybe?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Either way, she&#39;s a pretty great little addition to your Muppets lineup, and absolutely essential to berate poor Kermie.</p>

My mother was the one who made me get it. Because apparently we can&#39;t have Kermit without Miss Piggy. So here we are. But there were some surprising aspects of this minifigure. Her torso and leg printing is high quality, and dual-molded arms with printing is always a bonus. But the head mould might be the most intricately detailed and high quality head piece LEGO has ever made. It is phenomenal. She also has a 2x3 tile for one of her posters that looks nice. Overall, this is a figure I didn&#39;t want, but it surprised me in some ways and exhibits amazing quality. I recommend it if you&#39;re a big Muppets fan.</p>
