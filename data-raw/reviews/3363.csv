"Blade","2007-08-01T09:33:12.49Z","A Classic","I'm really happy I can be the first to review this awesome little set that gave me so many hours of pleasure as a kid. If you cant already tell this model is a classic.

This was one of the first small models to incorporate the blue crystal studs. These worked well with the white/ red colour scheme. Due to this I'm assuming he is part of the fire department collection. The fire helmet also gives it away. Love his little suit and helmet its just cool. 

Nothing really to gripe about with this model, but its only a little one, so yeah.

Overall I think this is a sweet model that captures the classic size, colours and limited pieces of the old days. Overall a 7/10. Definitely Get one if you can get your hands on one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"davidschor","2007-08-04T19:40:51.77Z","Solid Truck for the Chief","As we all know, the Fire Chief does not ride on the ladder truck - he drives a runabout.  This truck is a great accessory for anyone with a fire department in their town.  Also a great set in its own right, very simple and effective.  Wonderful choice of wheels gives the set an off-road feel.  Blue color elements really stand out and make this a special set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-16T13:44:32.53Z","Basic, but classic","This set is one of the Town theme, released in the year of 1992, and this have some characteristics of another small of the 1990's years. Like old sets of the Town theme, this have a nice building, altough the pieces don't features much things. The minifigure included is well designed, altough simple, a minifigure in a classic style, and it includes a helmet. The car have a plate with a different shape, combined with two wheels in a medium size, nice for cars like this, and it still in a good size. The front, made by some red plates, and with two &quot;lights&quot;, small plates with yellow color and a effect on it, increasing the front of the car. On each side, there are few red and white plates, altough simple, good to the size, and too for the minifigure, because this can move the arms with small plates on the side, that altough don't likes so much realistic, this car still nice. The &quot;glass&quot; isn't big, but it is good to the position of the minifigure inside the cockpit, and on it, too there are some directions, can be reached by the pilot. On the back, there are more plates, and another piece, with a different shape, increasing it again. Altough the design is old, the pieces are so much useful, the color scheme is awesome, and the playability is good. Another small town set that can be called a classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rescue Runabout is naturally the Impulse style cheap set, similar to many others during the years. It looks like a fun little set with a simple and easy build, it doesn't feature that many pieces, but for the price these sets went for back in the day... Well you really can't go wrong with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Included in the set is one Firefighter Mini-Figure. (Guess I had more than three, one of them must have lost his head, since there were a good number of older Mini-Figures whose face prints had faded somehow.) It doesn't appear to include any accessories, but I can't be 100% on that because I'm working off an old Christmas Haul photo and the set isn't in focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this was a great little set and it looks like it made (at least this LEGO Maniac.) a happy little stocking stuffer. You really can't go wrong with these smaller sets and I'm glad I did have it once, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. After all there are so many Fire sets in the new City stuff these older Town sets aren't entirely needed. Unless you're a really big fan of the Fire Sub-Theme, or looking for some cheap methods to get some Firefighter Mini-Figures to fill out your Fire Brigade set from the Modular Houses at <a href=""mailto:LegoShop@Home"">LegoShop@Home</a>. The older Town Firefighters would fit in quite nicely there, In my opinion, though I don't own the set yet I'm sure they'd look great.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
"peti7788","2021-12-19T19:24:16.473Z","My first fire set","<p>I was 4 or 5, when i get this set.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s very hard to stay objective about sets I got as a kid. Childhood is magical, and nostalgia distorts the facts. Now days, such a small number of parts set only sold in polybag sets.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifig</strong></h3>

<p>What is interesting about the set is that it is the last one that has the torso print introduced in 1981. They used the same print for 11 years, that&#39;s definitely a record!&nbsp;And maybe even the last year when there was still a solid stud&nbsp;on the minifigure&#39;s head.</p>

<h3><strong>Vehicle</strong></h3>

<p>Its biggest advantage is that it consists of virtually completely basic components.&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t even have a printed or sticker part, you can put it together from any remaining items at any time. With the exception of the siren and minifigure, it doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be a firefighter vehicle. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of vehicle it would look like, maybe it looks a bit like any &quot;<em>off-road 4x4</em>&quot;&nbsp;available at the time. (Jeep, Land Rover Defender, Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40)&nbsp;Being made for kids, so realism doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we look at it objectively, it was pretty boring, they could have put at least one <a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/2540/plate-special-1-x-2-side-handle-free-ends/"" target=""_blank"">winch</a> on the front.&nbsp;<em>The front looks much better and more detailed if you have a winch on it, try it yourself if you have this set.</em></p>

<h3><strong>Overall&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>I recommend the set because it can be built quickly, parts are easy to obtain. However, the firefighter has no equipment, not even a megaphone, an ax or an oxygen tank. The look is pretty 80&#39;s, but with 90&#39;s type wheels.&nbsp;But honestly, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6643-1/Fire-Chief-s-Truck"" target=""_blank"">predecessor</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1702-1/Fire-Fighter-4-x-4"" target=""_blank"">successor</a> were better, more small detail on it.</p>
