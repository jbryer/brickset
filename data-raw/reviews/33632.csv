<p>The Swedish Chef is entirely iconic and hilarious, his Minifigure counterpart is executed so well that I believe it to a contender for one&nbsp;of the most accurate Minifigures&nbsp;LEGO have ever produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a dual moulded head with his Chef&#39;s hat being accurately crooked, also his dark orange facial and other hair provides excellent accuracy, accuracy being displayed further especially with the absence of his eyes, and his gaping mouth. His torso starts his plain white apron and also features a large pink bow tie with printed arms adding further detail. Finally, his legs are dual moulded and feature side leg and feet printing.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Accessories-</p>

<p>His accessories include a light grey whisk, and a singing tomato, with a delightful face printed onto a red Minifigure head topped off with a green leaf element. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Conclusion-</p>

<p>This figure is excellent, capturing all essential details accurately, and including generous accessories. I cannot think of a single issue with this figure, which leads me to recommend it highly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
