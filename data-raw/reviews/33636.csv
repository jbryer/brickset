"Lobo_da_boss_","2022-06-06T21:06:20.977Z","A great improvement of previous Muppets done in this style!","<p>Opening:</p>

<p>Fozzie Bear is another greatly iconic member&nbsp;of The Muppets, and he was inevitably included in this CMF series. And his Minifigure execution is brilliant and accurate.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>Fozzie has an exclusive dual moulded head and hat combo&nbsp;with his eyes and&nbsp;mouth printed. The torso has his scarf printed accurately, and brilliant side arm printing&nbsp;depicting subtle fur, which was missing from previous characters such as Elmo and Cookie Monster, his legs also continue this detail with side printing adorning the available sides.</p>

<p>The Accessories-</p>

<p>His accessories include both a 4 piece black microphone with stand which is quite decent, and a yellow moulded banana which is fine, but I believe a new piece for a rubber chicken would&#39;ve been more appropriate, as that is his more iconic utensil. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In Conclusion-</p>

<p>Fozzie Bear is not only one of the&nbsp;best characters that The Muppets have to offer, but he is also one of the&nbsp;best&nbsp;looking Minifigures in this series, he is one of the figures that I see a price increase as inevitable in future, thus why I recommend you get him soon if you do desire to obtain this Minifigure.&nbsp;</p>
