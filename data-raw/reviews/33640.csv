<p>Compared to previous year&#39;s Star Wars VIP rewards, this is very disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s heavy enough, I wouldn&#39;t want to use it for its intended purpose.&nbsp; Definitely too heavy to use as a zipper pull.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even something with good display value.&nbsp; You&#39;d have to get close to know what it is.&nbsp;</p>

As a keychain this would be terrible as it is quite heavy and would possibly scratch anything else you have in your pocket. Its neat for a shelf but you can tell what it is unless you have it in your hands.&nbsp;</p>
