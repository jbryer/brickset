"haydenw","2022-08-16T20:28:30.447Z","Step In The Right Direction","<p>As a huge fan of the Architecture series, the Great Pyramid of Giza build far separated itself from other landscape models. At 1,476 pieces, the scale of Giza was much larger than expected. The foundation provided for a unique build&nbsp;by avoiding a&nbsp;symmetrically identical build through its&nbsp;use of smaller pyramids and river flow. The interior of the pyramid brought a bit of complexity which allowed me to slow down and enjoy the actual build rather than speeding through.</p>

<p>As for the aesthetic - it is a beautiful display piece or mantelpiece and provides enough&nbsp;size to draw attention for conversation. If you really want to exploit Giza&#39;s massive size, I reckon buying an additional set to fulfil&nbsp;the whole pyramid. With the set providing an additional label in hieroglyphics, adding the alternative label on the opposite side would be a great way to get all that this set has to offer.</p>

<p>Overall, The Great Pyramid of Giza was the most entertaining build I have ever had within the Architecture series;&nbsp;thoroughly appreciating the sheer size of the finished build. I hope the future of the&nbsp;Architecture series continues to bring&nbsp;growth in their physical size.</p>

<p>Although I receive this set for free, but I am willing to spend the cash to buy it. It is so good as a display for me, and it provided information and knowledge about Pyramid of Giza itself. Anyway, this is the quick review of the set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/c0c049c6-c7a8-4584-a655-6cd66e430fda/LEGO+21058+The+Great+Pyramid+of+Giza?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>We can see a white pyramid with a golden cap sits near the river Nile. In the middle, there are two smaller pyramids called Queens&#39; Pyramids. Next to it is the path coming from the temple next to the river going upwards towards the Giza Pyramids and there are three sphinxes nearby. There is a village where the worker and artisans who build the pyramids live. And there is a singular Obelisk in the village.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/5c46273b-65ad-4b4d-8b94-250be8db2736/LEGO+21058+The+Great+Pyramid+of+Giza?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>This set is only half of the whole pyramid. The rear part of the pyramid are cut away, so we can view the tunnels according to the real Pyramid of Giza. The tunnels themselves are the entrance to the Queen&#39;s chamber and the Pharaoh Tomb itself. There are two smaller tunnels going upwards which are the exit perhaps for air.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/3d1423d6-9188-4514-a036-34dc02df8c22/LEGO+21058+The+Great+Pyramid+of+Giza?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>The pyramid&#39;s shell can be lifted to get the scene where the pyramid is half constructed like in the photo above. This alternative scene depicts the pyramid is still under construction. We can also see boats on the foreground carrying materials through the fertile Nile river.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/4dfab2f9-9970-40fb-8f3d-a6dcd348cd45/LEGO+21058+The+Great+Pyramid+of+Giza?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>From the closer view, we can see the condition of the pyramid under construction. We can see how the workers brought heavy stone up the pyramid using inclined plane and pulley principles like the anchor system on ship. From the photo above, we can see the golden coloured pyramid cap being pulled up. There are also crane system to move materials vertically.</p>

<p>From the photo, we can see the inner part of the pyramid&#39;s shell. There are many staircase parts used to support the pyramid&#39;s shell to make it strong and does not collapse easily.</p>

<p>For me, this is the best architecture set as it is really beautifully designed with a lot of details and as a history aficionado, this is definitely amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>I love building this set, but there are parts that make my heart sank which is the parts where you place the 1x1 parts for the greeneries, the tree leaves and also parts on the under-constructed pyramids. You will need to pay attention for the placement (I am a bit of OCD person and everything have to be placed correctly according to the manual instruction).</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Amount of parts is satisfactory for me. Though I am willing to spend more to get the full pyramid that have hinge mechanism, so we can split it open while still having a whole pyramid.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This is mostly for display. But we can teach children about history with this set! I love explaining about the history of pyramid to adults. I even have a video about it (URL provided below).</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well, I think it is a bit high, but the price for architecture sets are always higher than the standard sets. So this is normal. But if you can wait, you should aim for special discount or sale.</p>
