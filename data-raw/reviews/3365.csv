"Blade","2007-08-01T09:55:07.473Z","Mini Dozer","Another classic I get to be first to review. The first mini-loader with a mini-fig (that i got any way). Complete with warning lights on top, swing open top, fully moving  bucket and two leavers for bucket control, this model is the real deal. Machine's like this are meant to have two gear leavers one for up and down and one for tilt.

The mini-fig is true old school with red overalls and that lame black Beatles hairstyle.

Again another fig with really no faults mainly due to its size and age.

Overall this is a good model that captures the classic size, colours and limited pieces of the old days. Overall a 7/10.  Get one if you are able as it makes a great addition to any construction or classic set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"johnny_5","2007-10-07T03:13:45.607Z","What Lego used to be...","In 1992 TLG was not interested in things like Exo-Force, Bionicle or KK2 which seemes to be obsessive with the storyline of the theme and not the playability of the sets themselves. Here is a classic example of what made Lego got famous off of in the first place, sets with very high playability.
When you get this set and build it, it screams action. While it doesnt have 1000 pieces or is not accurate to the tiniest detail, it is undoubtably a tractor. You get the impression that this little thing can put in a hard days work in your town and never complain. All this is achieved with less than 40 pieces. 
I think TLG as lost site of these type of things with police station after huge police station, or so many emergency workers that you forget the regular people.
I just wish nowdays there would be more 3-4 dollar sets like this one and less large bulky custom pieces you can only use for one thing. Lego... use what you got to make what you need.

That being said I'm looking forward to next year with the impulse line of small sets. Maybe TLG is finally getting back to thier old roots, but i doubt it they never learn.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction only has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of yellow pieces which are always useful for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has only one minifig. This figure has a red overall, a white shirt, black hair and a basic smiley face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6512-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The completed model looks very good. You can adjust the shovel and the windscreen can be opened very easily as well. This vehicle may doesn't have a lot of play features but it's still fun to maneuver it.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"szerman","2009-12-21T13:24:54.547Z","Sweet","This is my second Lego set. When I was a child (8 years) I don't like it very well. But now when I am 21, it's nice set in my opinion. Classic look, interesting window and nice excavator arm with bucket. I have all parts of this without crystal white-round lights (2+1 additional) and 1 additional crystal red-round light. I'm sorry for my English :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Avid_Bricks","2021-11-02T20:36:27.623Z","Good Little Set.","<p>I paid $5 for this set used and I like it a lot. You get a figure and a tractor. I would recommend not spending over $20 on this as you can get nicer sets nowadays. Overall it&#39;s good for anyone who wants an old set. Wouldn&#39;t recommend it for play though as it breaks to easily.&nbsp;</p>
