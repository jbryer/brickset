"RTS013","2022-09-04T19:05:30.96Z","The SpeedChampions line is being shaken, not stirred.","<p>Expanding the SpeedChampions line to now include famous movie vehicles is great!&nbsp;Not only are there countless&nbsp;prospects in that category alone, but it also shows that there is a willingness to&nbsp;keep growing the theme in the first place. I have big hopes for the future!</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>This is a fairly typical SpeedChampions build with many half stud offsets and sideways construction, but the attention&nbsp;to&nbsp;detail have gone up even further. For example, the excellent use of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6248078/plate-1x1-w-1-5-plate-1x1-downwards"">1x1 plates with a stud on the side</a> to fill in the gaps around the fenders. I also think there are more pieces attached by just a single stud or clip in this set than any of the previous&nbsp;ones I have encountered. It can be a bit finicky, but I wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;say that it&#39;s difficult. You do need a bit of patience to line up those tiny pieces for a refined result though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few new elements introduced for this set, very <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6407767/roof-tile-1x2-inverted-deg-45-w-cut"">useful ones</a> that I&#39;m sure will be recurring frequently from now on.&nbsp;And a bunch of prints, including <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6408442/1-4-sphere-1x1x1-1-3-no-1"">front</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6408440/tile-1x2-1-2-circle-no-1"">rear</a> lights and the grille.&nbsp;I&#39;m particularly happy with the grille, printed across something as bulky as a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6408450/brick-1x6-no-14"">1x6 brick</a> and a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6408449/frame-plate-4x4-no-1"">4x4 frame plate</a>. It looks much more refined than what that sounds like. The separation between them is virtually seamless, from any natural viewing distance it absolutely&nbsp;looks like a single but well detailed thing. I may just have been lucky with that though, because out of three included <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6408441/plate-1x1-no-25"">1x1 printed plates</a>, one was really off-centre. Without the inclusion of that third spare one, the model would have looked very wonky. Hopefully the larger prints are, as with my particular ones, more consistent in production quality as you naturally only get one each of those.</p>

<p>The new rear windscreen is&nbsp;slightly off in printed colour compared to the surrounding bricks, as have become a trend by now. However, for some reason it&#39;s not as bad to my eyes here as it has been with other sets. The print is slightly too dark, but I think the curved shape of the part catches the light and shadows in such a way that it simply blends in well anyway.</p>

<p>There are a nice selection of elements in drum lacquered silver, including no less than eight <em>extra</em> <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6217498/flat-tile-1x3-no-14"">1x3 tiles</a> (so you can have different&nbsp;licence plates with stickers).</p>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>The model is distinctly recognizable to anyone that knows the source material. It doesn&#39;t really have any bad angle, which is an impressive achievement at this scale. Speaking of which, the model is 170x72x51mm with a 88mm wheelbase while the real car is 4570x1680x1346mm with a 2489mm wheelbase. That results in scales averaging around 1:27, except the width. A perfect 1:27 scale replica would be 169x62x50mm, with a 92mm wheelbase. Or in other words, the perfect model should have been more than a full stud narrower. But again, it still looks fantastic.</p>

<p>I chose not to apply many of the stickers. There aren&#39;t that many anyway, by&nbsp;SpeedChampions standards, and they only add small details such as door handles. Though the details themselves look fine, they come with covering entire elements with a grey background that is quite badly colour matched to the plastic. My recommendation is, build the entire set first, then decide if you think it needs the extra details of the stickers. I simply found it good enough without them to not spoil it with that mismatching patchwork.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>As the detail goes up, these sets do become less playable but more displayable. It&#39;s a very good size for a toy car, easy to grab and swoosh around.&nbsp;But as previously mentioned, there are several tiny pieces that probably will be knocked off or at least misaligned if used that way.</p>

<p>The car has a simulated back seat, but the two front seats are the only ones that can actually accommodate minifigures. The included <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sc102/james-bond-black-tuxedo-(no-time-to-die)"">figure</a>, based on the No Time To Die film specifically,&nbsp;has fine printing on the front and back of the torso, hips and legs.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Wether you like Bond in particular or just classic cars in general this is a great rendition of an iconic vehicle. However, the price has gone up with these latest additions to the theme.&nbsp;But then so has the level of detail. I think the price has gone up more than the quality, though. Wether it&#39;s worth it or not, ultimately comes down to how much you are drawn to this set. Personally I&#39;m happy with what I got for my money, but&nbsp;for reference that was&nbsp;with a&nbsp;37% discount. <em>(RRP in my region&nbsp;being&nbsp;roughly&nbsp;equivalent to &euro;30/$30)</em></p>

"StarKiller22515","2023-01-02T05:39:54.627Z","The names Bond, James Bond","<p>Finally a LEGO James Bond minifigure! This set is an amazing set. The minifigure is great and is very useful to make other customs. The build of the vehicle is beautiful and sleek for a $20 speed champions set. The printed parts add a lot of detail while the sticker detail is nice but is optional for most. The extra licensee plates can be used to replicate the other James Bonds Aston Martins from over the years and the different James Bonds. I would highly recommend buying this set as it is basically perfect.&nbsp;</p>
