I&#39;m not a huge Mario fan, but I have played most of the Mario games and I know who Bowser is. As soon as I saw this set I was impressed with the detail and imagination.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>I loved every minute of this build, which probably took me about 3 to 4 hours. The base is built first and is fairly basic, but the&nbsp;tiles are a bit fiddly. Next comes Bowser&#39;s body, which I was expecting to include more Technic elements than it did. The main Technic pieces are used for his neck, hip joints, and for creating the (ingenious) attachment points for his shell, the rest is regular LEGO - very pleasing! The body is quite dense and includes mechanisms for turning the head and opening the jaw.</p>

<p>Next come the legs. These are chunky and sturdy with some lovely curves and fit nicely into the hip joints mentioned earlier. These joints are loose and allow the legs to fall downwards slightly when Bowser is lifted off the ground - a really nice touch.</p>

<p>After the legs, work starts on the head. This is built in small sections which are then added to the model. The amount of detailing and the lovely contouring of the head is quite spectacular, and seeing it come together is very satisfying.</p>

<p>The shell is next, and is a masterpiece of LEGO construction. It is made in three sections and the way these are shaped and fitted together must have taken hours of experimenting. The white edging to the shell should also get a mention; the construction and result is pretty much perfect.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s the arms and hands. Like the legs, these are chunky and sturdy, and I was pleased to find out that the elbow joints are functional. Not only that, but the elbows themselves use curved pieces beautifully to ensure there are no unsightly gaps.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>Well, I think this is pretty much a perfect representation of the Mighty Bowser in LEGO form! He&#39;s just delightful, and I can&#39;t stop looking at him; I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have a permanent place on my display shelves. My favourite bits are the shell and the head, which are fantastically designed and packed with detail. However, the arms and legs are not lacking either, the arms in particular with the studded bands look suitably mighty! And I love the hands with those chubby sausage fingers.</p>

<p>The mechanisms to turn the head and open the jaw work very well, as does the release of a fireball when you open the jaw - surprisingly effective! If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a lever to move his eyes, but I&#39;m guessing that wasn&#39;t possible. I might have a go myself and see. Also, a sound brick with that classic Bowser evil laugh would have been the cherry on the cake.</p>

<p>The base is a nice addition and shows him off well. I like the broken stone surface which looks like Bowser has been jumping up and down in a rage (which is pretty much all he does tbh!).</p>

<p>At &pound;230 he&#39;s not cheap, but I think he&#39;s worth every penny. I may even get a Mario to see if I can get him to roar.</p>
