Not really ...","<p><em>Note: my copy of this set had a mistake on Day 1 where Star-Lord was replaced with the Benetar mini-model from Day 14. If you notice this in your copy, chances are you have two Benetars and no Star-Lord minifigures.</em></p>

<p>I found this set at my local Kohl&#39;s, unexpectedly, and seeing the minifigure selection on the front, I decided to pick it up. My experience with 2021&#39;s Avengers advent calendar was positive, albeit being my first of these calendars, and with a few months to go until December, I figured I could beat our beloved Brickset staff to the punch and review this calendar.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>this is a perfectly mediocre advent calendar, but lacks creativity and costs far too much to feel worthwhile.</p>

<p>To start, the minifigure selection is nice, especially if you lack set #76193: The Guardians&#39; Ship as I do. I particularly love the new Rocket (Day 5) and Groot&nbsp;(Day 19) minifigures, especially in comparison to the #76102: Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest set from the <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> wave. Mantis (Day 13) is fantastic, though the hair mold is a rubber that really likes to stick to the head. And I am quite sure Star-Lord (Day 1) would have been a fantastic minifigure ... if my copy included one.</p>

<p>The two Christmas-themed minifigures are hit-and-miss. Nebula (Day 9) is included with a white and blue Christmas sweater that features Thanos and the Infinity Stones. I think this is a bizarre choice, considering that Thanos&#39; and Nebula&#39;s relationship in the series was anything <em>but</em> friendly and that his genocidal space rocks would <em>not</em> be something she would wear to a Christmas party or event. It&#39;s a joke that doesn&#39;t make any sense when you think about it for a couple seconds. Now, if this minifigure was Ronan from the first <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> (a minifigure that had a limited release), I think this joke would have been far funnier as the Guardians relentlessly mock his obsession with Thanos in that movie.</p>

<p>Drax&nbsp;(Day 24) is included and is a welcome addition considering that Drax minifigures are very difficult to get these days. He wears a hilarious green dancing Groot Christmas sweater that makes more sense as a visual gag than Nebula&#39;s. My only gripe is that his head is green, which I understand is more accurate to the comics, games, and even animated series, but renders this minifigure incompatible with previous Drax figures. This could have been remedied with a regular shirtless torso that&#39;s also green, but would have resulted in the loss of the sweater piece.</p>

<p>Models of the <em>Milano</em> (Day 18), the <em>Benetar</em> (Day 14), the <em>Benetar&#39;s</em> escape pod&nbsp;(Day 11), the Knowhere mining pod (Day 11) and Yondu&#39;s pod (Day 10) are all included and are recognizable representations of these ships from the <em>Guardians</em> movies thus far. Rocket&#39;s gun (Day 7) is an over-sized but fun weapon, and the tool crate (Day 6) is filled with references to the movies - including Yondu&#39;s arrow, the batteries from the Sovereign, and even Thor&#39;s spare eye (an extra is included too).</p>

<p>There are a few models that are a bit disappointing, however. The large candy cane (Day 15) feels nonsensical in a <em>Guardians</em>-themed calendar, and the three days (Days 21, 22, and 23) to build the rocket sleigh result in a strange, awkward, and boring model that more resembles a Mini Micros reject than a Marvel-inspired spaceship. There is a dreaded tool rack (Day 4) that is quite boring, and the tree that mounts to Groot&#39;s back (Day 20) is an underwhelming day&#39;s worth of building.</p>

<p>The parts selection is interesting, including a pair of headphones, extra silverware, cassette tapes, and even the Power stone (with three extras) - not to mention the excessive quantity of miscellaneous plates and tiles that come in handy for MOCs.</p>

<p>To conclude, the retail price for this set is $45 USD. For all the talk about prices on this site, I can confidently state that I do not think a handful of minifigures and tiny models are worth $45, especially not in this capacity. Given the previous year&#39;s calendar sold for $40 but had substantially better builds and minifigures, I would not recommend this calendar unless on sale.</p>
