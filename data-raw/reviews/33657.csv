However, a figure like Groot should at least be able to raise her hand without falling over immediately! The problem starts with the legs that you cannot position so far apart that the model gets a safe footing. Don&#39;t dream to let Groot stand like on the box cover or in the Promo pictures that is pure fantasy.<br />
<br />
The head is very heavy, with many colours from the Friends range&nbsp;inside, to make it more difficult to modify. Larger and smaller pieces fall off easily with only a slight touch on the head. This is especially frustrating when you are building the head and try to marry it off later with the rest of the figure.&nbsp;The eyes don&#39;t align with the brows, at least not like on the box cover. You get the strong feeling that the whole set was not really tested.<br />
<br />
With about 20 stickers and the only prints for the eyes on 2 shields, the set gets a cheap feeling. As a display set this is really disappointing.</p>

<p>As much as I love the Guardians of the Galaxy and many other Avengers sets, this building experience&nbsp;was completely frustrating to me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The cassette was still the best part of the set, sadly also easy to be ruined by the stickers in the long run.<br />
<br />
I bought the set with a 37% discount so the ppp ratio was at least okay.</p>
