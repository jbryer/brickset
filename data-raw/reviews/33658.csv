<p>I missed the first enclosed&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76108-1/Sanctum-Sanctorum-Showdown"">Sanctum Sanctorum 76108</a>&nbsp;which I want to have for my city. But loo and behold, fast forward to 4 years later, we have this modular version!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foremost, this is a modular set. You can connect it to any modular building from Creator Expert and also to Daily Bugle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658154427364-FLXFR8IPAOXOLNQ4MOWH/DSC06458.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this set is build on 32 x 32 baseplate. So it is four time larger than the earlier version which is only 16 x 16 size. Let us see what it looks like when connected to the Boutique Hotel which has similar colour tone.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658155636785-XCOCUNLB4N2KF7U0DA0D/DSC06494.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>When connected this way, it does not look that good especially with the small alley in between both buildings. And the alley is also inaccessible due to the large rubbish bin that is blocking the way. Let us try another connection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658156425167-BAM65CP8X3JONARZKA2F/DSC06498.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>It definitely looks better when connected this way. The first floor (or ground&nbsp; floor) for both buildings seems to have similar height. But the other floors have different heights which make them look a bit mismatched in terms of height.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658156424052-48C6DSHARPHMKLTY21RW/DSC06486.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the colour tone for both building looks great with this orientation. They also look good when viewed isometrically from above.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658159761607-N9J3FFZGSWL40WU0JZ55/DSC06465.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Did you know that there is monster (which we assume is Gargantos) on one of the side of the building? Unfortunately, this so called Gargantos does not extend into the building. It looks like he appears through the portal which is located on the exterior wall of the Sanctum.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658159761040-BWX6BW5XZRLF811AMKUK/DSC06502.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Notable feature at the back of the building is a big billboard featuring Captain America and an open portal that go straight to the&nbsp;Time Stone and Book of Cagliostro. We wonder who open the portal as villains will be able to steal them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658160111535-4F5S9NJPXUIXETLMENYC/DSC06503.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Those three features position can be interchangeable. On the photo above, the position of Captain America billboard has been replaced with open portal into the Sanctum while the position of the open portal has been replaced with Gargantos.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658160110075-51USU2RZA89UOQA39RLW/DSC06505.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The early position of Gargantos has become Captain America Billboard. When connecting to other building from this side, the feature such as this billboard needs to be taken down.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/903f5e27-2156-404d-b416-60ff4e0e5763/DSC06512.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Close up view to the Time Stone and Book of&nbsp;Cagliostro with the portal on the wall removed for easier viewing. The Book of Cagliostro is somehow protected with a chain which we can only assume a magical chain.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/6788a688-e1ca-4991-94eb-40a45d245374/DSC06514.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>There is not much on the rooftop. There is a small area used for planting and various of ventilation shafts. The most notable parts are three smokestacks that probably used for heating each of the three floors of the Sanctum.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658187290173-X3PSYCKMEM0EAEHWZNRQ/DSC06527.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>On the third floor, there are many artefacts displayed which make the room like a small museum or gallery. The so-called &quot;Windows of the World&quot; is also located here. If you would like to see more photos of this level, they can be seen on my blog (link provided near the end of this review). I am not placing too many photos here as not to make this review cluttered by too many photos.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658188312789-5J84PT400OIU32D3QZ6M/DSC06536.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The second floor is consisted of a mezzanine that is connected to a grand staircase in the middle. This floor is also full of artefacts all over the room. There are also two bookcases with a door in the middle on this floor. Again for view at another angle of this room, you can visit the blog.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658189782692-F400DT7EUUL75HG1PW3M/DSC06555.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The door between the bookcases is the hidden portal. We assume it is the &quot;Rotunda of Gateway&quot;. It can have access either to the outer space, to the mountain (assumed to be Himalayas), and to the desert.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658189802653-1ULBDN3B62RVKQ3VQXFO/DSC06558.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>This photo is showing the door has been opened, and it is showing access to the desert region.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658189800579-BQ2VMMMWQHV3KT3KHXSX/DSC06557.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The door has change into access place into the Himalayas mountains.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658189782970-Z1M7P38GS5619EUNKERT/DSC06556.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>And now the door has shown access to the outer space. How to change that?&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/16bcf7d2-2f48-4337-898f-7161d05ff58a/DSC06499.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Those backgrounds can be changed by the two knobs which have been designed as air conditioners or ventilation duct. On the photo above, they are the two white squares in the middle of the photo.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1658190198413-Q5ZYHJJB2OW45S22AEOJ/DSC06546.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The first floor is not very spacious. It has a small lobby with a door with special opening hinges. There are several pictures hanged on the wall, a grandfather clock and an artefact. To view more photos of this floor, you need to look at the blog. We think the first floor can be made larger if the space for the alley behind the building is used up. But it will increase the piece count and probably make this set more expensive.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/9cc78ad0-d23f-4a69-8a5e-57f35770c3fb/DSC06452.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>This set provides nine minifigure. From left to right they are&nbsp;Dead Strange, Dr. Strange, Wong, Spiderman, Sinister Strange, Ebony Maw, Scarlet Witch, Master Mordo and Ironman.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/2b5d2c77-878d-47fc-885b-bb04ca67c766/DSC06454.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>To see their face more clearly, the head accessories have been removed or opened. The printing on their torsos are quite detailed.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/c2b3255a-8cc9-4788-a897-cf1fa8b82ee6/DSC06455.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The torsos on their backside are shown here. They are also printed in detail. Characters that have dual faces are also shown here. They are Dr Strange, Sinister Strange, Scarlet Witch, Master Mordo and Ironman.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>AFOLs that enjoy building modular sets will feel at home while building this set. And it is fun assembling the 9 minifigures consisting heroes and villains.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts are plentiful to build this set. It should be satisfactory.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Beside a modular set, children will enjoy playing with this set with a lot of minifigures, play features and a cool large building. It will also look nice when displayed by itself or joined up together with other modular sets.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much since I get this set for free. But by looking at the price, it is more costly compared to the Creator Expert modular set using price per piece indicator. But this is normal since LEGO has to pay the licence to Marvel, and they passed the licence cost to the customers as usual. If you are patient enough, just wait until discount or special offer for price reduction on third party LEGO retailers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The iconic top floor could have used some more detailing in my opinion.</p>

<p>The minifigures and pretty great and a good reason to get this set (even though the Doctor Strange Figure can now be bought through the $5 polybag.</p>
