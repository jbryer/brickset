"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-29T04:50:36Z","Good, but not a favourite","This is one of my first sets with the newer more detailed faces. The boat isn't as good as 6508, but a tad more realistic. It's a swamp boat, just like these found in the Everglades. It has an rather big propellor as a motorand there's another livevest in it.
Just 7/10 for me, because of those rather big pontoon parts underneath, which make it a little bit simple to build. For some reason the minifig looks a little bit odd, but it must be the strange colour sheme of the figure's Torso.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-01T10:12:47.91Z","River Cruser","Not to sound like an echo but this is another good model. I enjoyed adding and using this model in my collection and think he made a great addition.

The boat seems very plain, as in lack of pieces, at the front but that's the way these boats are meant to be. They have tried to make up for this by alternating smooth and studded pieces which works well here and added in stars on the blue flat bar. Printed not stickered which was definite thumbs up, come to think of it i have never seen this piece again so it could well be a rarity.

The driver wearing a green life vest was a bit weird but orange may have clashed with the boat. This is hidden under the yellow vest. A cool looking face complete with blue sunnies and stubble. One of the coolest old school faces ever because its so much more realistic to the original or &quot;Plain&quot; face.

Again No real flaws due to the small, simplicity of the old school model.

Overall I rate this a 7/10. It's a good classic model where LEGO was starting to branch out with more colours and find new uses for pieces. Definitely another one for any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T07:23:31.763Z","Simple yet Attractive…","I have always been a fan of these Glades boats since Miami Vice, so the prospect of adding both this set and ‘Speed Splash’ (6567) appealed to me greatly.

The set is simple in design and in construction, nothing too fancy about it, it just represents the real thing very well.   There is a mixture of smooth and studded pieces (as mentioned previously) and I think this is done relatively well.   There is always a danger in mixing these pieces but I think this set is perfect.   The skipper sits in an elevated position just in front of the twin fins which support a gantry arrangement on which the propeller is mounted.   The colour scheme is white, red and blue and works well and the addition of the studs mounted underneath the bow of the boat give the impression the boat is weighted at the stern or travelling at speed – very realistic on both counts.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2009-12-23T03:36:08.937Z","Long forgotton set.","This was another one that i had forgotton all about, untill i saw the picture on this site in a random search. i tried putting it back together, but i was missing a few pieces, so my model now has a few color variations. It still turned out well though, i think.

The colors of this boat always made me think that it was a kind of a stunt boat. It's a nice little boat, but a bit of an oddity in it's design, in my opinion anyway. I think that the pontoons are to small in proportion to the rear end. I can't really remember how i got it, i can't even remember playing much with it as a child. I can remember trying to use the pieces to buid a small aeroplane, but that's about the only thing i remember about this set.

Seeing as this set, to me, was not very memorable, i don't think very highly of it. As i said, i think the proportions are wrong, and it doesn't look quite right. In my opinion anyway. I also think that the minifig is to high. Allthough i know that this is how these types of boats look in real life, i don't think it works here. It makes the model look way to small.

Looking at the model itself, it's very sturdy built, and the minifig is nice, with the more detailed face, and the life vest.

Anyway, it's not a bad set at all, but it is not great either. I don't think i would pick it up if it was released today. But, if you are looking for a smart little racer for your town's marine area, this might be worth considering after all. If you have two, the race is on!

I almost forgot I had this set because it is so unmemorable, but then again I look at that Mini-Figure and that little blue star plate and it clicks... Ah the fun I had with this thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't let nostalgia fool you though this is not the best set of the LEGO Boats out there, but it is, or rather was, a good cheap little stocking stuffer. Can't be sure if I got it for Christmas though, more than likely it was an impulse purchase for one of those days when I was being very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is as I said simple and uses few pieces, but that isn't really a problem, it's a great little boat to put alongside larger vessels for a proper nautical scene and the Mini-Figure was loads of fun back in the day. Aside from the unique looking blue star patterned piece though I think I could build this up using pieces from any set...Or then again maybe not, the propellor isn't exactly easy to come by in my current collection. If you're interested in this set I say don't let others tell you what to do, just go ahead and buy it, its worth owning if only for the Mini-Figure to populate LEGO Town/City.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,5
