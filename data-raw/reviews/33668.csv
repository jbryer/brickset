Obviously pieces are minimal, and its completed quickly, but it such an oddity I had to buy it. The mechanics of the bike work quite nice, they seem smooth, and it travels far. I love the large bathtub piece and the rubber duck. Wasn&#39;t expecting a giant full back tattoo of a rubber duck on the minifig! Grateful for the alternate hairpiece. This guy will look great at the Lego beach even without the bike.</p>

<p>This is one of the two first Stuntz bike I bought. I didn&#39;t pay attention to the final part of the instruction and thought it was the good old <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Pullback-Motor"">pullback motor</a>. But no, instead you push it up 3 or so times&nbsp;to move it, which is something new and a welcome one.</p>

<p>The minifigure is nice with a fitting face print and sweet/goofy tattoo on his back, if not for the shoulder blade, I could see the front being cover and arms switch around to turn it into a t-shirt.</p>

<p>One tiny nitpick I could say is I wish the minifigure&#39;s hair and helmet weren&#39;t common colors, would be sweet to get the trans-orange scuba mask in here.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s too much of a goofy set to not recommend, and it&#39;s cheap to those with pocket money. If you haven&#39;t got any of the Stuntz sets, I suggest&nbsp;getting this first.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2023-02-18T09:37:22.08Z","Nice but flawed","<p>The idea of this theme is good: fly-wheel bikes to perform stunts. The bikes&nbsp;and figures are the main attraction. This bathtub bike&nbsp;is, in my opinion, the best of the bunch. It is funky, weird, awesome...I love it. The figure has a fabulous &quot;duck&quot; tattoo on his back! Amazing.</p>

<p>So this set would be gold, if only....if only the flywheel wasn&#39;t cheap Chinese crap.</p>

<p>After only a few uses the fly-wheel&nbsp;starts rattling, blocking, not turning well any more...it seems to be a problem with all the bikes since I have bought others too, and they all share the same problem.</p>

<p>So: the parts are great, the system is flawed....</p>
