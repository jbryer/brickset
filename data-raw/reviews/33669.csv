<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many improvements over the older generation&nbsp;train (60197), such as&nbsp;larger carriages, LED lights, larger platform, more mini-figures, more details, larger seating areas,&nbsp;the addition of doors, and more tracks than the older set (4x extra straight pieces).</p>

<p>I own the older train and found that the food carriage was rather lacking, with some small tables sticking out of the walls and no seating. The new train has seats, a wheelchair friendly area, and a larger kitchen (including&nbsp;a coffee machine!).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also got doors on the carriages which makes the train feel more accessible and open.</p>

<p>The brick built front feels stronger and more interesting to build, and the battery access is easier to open (you don&#39;t have to take some tiles off the top like 60197, it just slides out).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Large&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Extra tracks compared with 60197</p>

<p>-LED Lights that have 10 stage dimming</p>

<p>-6 Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>-LEGO Bike included</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Doors on carriages can go inwards, making moving the train annoying.</p>

<p>-Pricey ($220 AUD)</p>

<p>-Once built and played with for a while, not a whole lot more can be done with the train without extra tracks&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Battery compartment can be a little crowded due to the LED lights being added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, a great set for all ages that is entertaining and very much improved over the older generation set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5/5&nbsp;</p>

"BricksForThought","2022-08-26T19:09:48.27Z","Half a step backwards, Many steps forward","<p>The latest edition to the City remote control&nbsp;passenger trains is the 60337 Express Passenger Train. While it may appear as yet another train, or perhaps a regression&nbsp;from the previous 60197 Passenger Train from 2018, the set implements several key features that positively&nbsp;distinguish&nbsp;it from the gradually increasing arsenal of lego city trains.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the negatives first, starting with the colour scheme.</p>

<p>Personally, I am impartial to the lime colour scheme of the locomotive and cars, although I much rather prefer the dark blue and flame yellowish-orange of the previous passenger train. Thankfully, a colour-swap shouldn&#39;t be too difficult. The main lime parts of the locomotive include two large slope bricks, which are available in several colours (i.e. blue from the current police station), and some tiling on the sides. The rest of the lime seen on&nbsp;the set is in the form of plates, forming stripes along the rear of the locomotive and the train cars themselves, overall making a colour-swap a quick and effective method of modifying the look and feel&nbsp;of the entire set.&nbsp;While the lime matches the current theme of 2022&#39;s city transit-themed sets with&nbsp;lime and teal, I feel that the lime is too overbearing, and maybe a teal accent would&#39;ve been nice.</p>

<p>Another critique shared by many is the design of the nose on the locomotive. The windscreen piece is curved, unlike the straight angles of the rest of the nose, and breaks the uniformity and &#39;crispness&#39; of the design. A video I watched on YouTube suggested replacing&nbsp;the windscreen piece with am unprinted Star Wars windscreen, seen on many snow speeders&nbsp;and the older X-Wings and Y-Wings. That simple modification greatly increases the visual value of the locomotive.</p>

<p>Ok, enough negative, now time for the positives:</p>

<p>The use of the double doors on the train cars makes for a much-needed sense of realism to the rc train line. Now minifigures have access to the cars without having to remove the roofs (which can still be removed for the sake of us humans). It&#39;s also nice to see the doors in the trans-brown/black, and with the black frames. I can imagine these parts becoming especially useful for custom builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of light elements for the locomotive &#39;headlights&#39; is&nbsp;also a welcome addition. The cargo train released alongside this set claims to also be compatible, although lights are not included in that set. These are the first Lego brand lights I have owned, so I am&nbsp;excited to use&nbsp;them in potential future builds.</p>

<p>The minifigures selection isn&#39;t exceptional, but it is definitely more positive than negative. Two minifigures in transit&nbsp;uniforms are included, potentially making up for the lack of a driver in this year&#39;s cargo train. The inclusion of a wheelchair is great. More minifigure&nbsp;diversity is always a plus, even if I wished the wheels were clear instead of&nbsp;green.</p>

<p>Overall, the few critiques I have of this set are easily fixable with very slight modifications, and the positives definitely contribute to this set feeling more than &#39;yet another passenger train&#39;. Of course, the retail price of $190 USD is a hard pill to swallow, and I don&#39;t think the pros of this set justify the price increase compared to&nbsp;previous train sets. Nonetheless, as this is my first ever lego train set, I am still happy to own it, wether I choose to keep it as is, modify it, or use the parts for my own builds. If you have other lego trains, this might not be worth the price, and I&#39;d recommend buying the current train station, which is a welcome addition to any city, and while expensive at $100 USD, is nearly half the cost of this train. All said and done, if you are in a similar situation as I am&nbsp;and have never owned a lego train, I feel you won&#39;t be disappointed in all this set has to offer, and is a great place to start your&nbsp;lego train adventures.</p>
