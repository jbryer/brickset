The gray front bumper/wench is clever.  The minifig has stubble on his face, as you would expect from a minifig who perhaps had to camp out in the woods and hadn't shaved in a couple of days.  This little vehicle displays nicely standing alongside my much larger Off-road 4x4 set #5510.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I really liked this model as a child, there is just something about it that makes it look cool. The shape is quite well designed for a model with so few pieces and is very aesthetically pleasing. It has quite a wide thin windshield, which looks the part. No doors witch is perfect for a model with no roof, just jump straight out. Also comes with head lights, tail lights, spoiler and a bumper, which doubles as a tow point.

The colour is quite good too. I'm not usually that fond of yellow but this model really makes it look good. It works well with the yellow of the mini-fig and his green clothes complement it so nicely.

The mini-fig is dressed in green pants and jacket and a red hat. His face is the one with the blue sunglasses and stubble. I always liked this face and thought it looked really good. He also comes equipped with a radio, which is a very nice extra.

Overall this is a great model with excellent aesthetics, good playability for a $3.50 model and fits in well with any town. I feel this model is a 6/10 or Above Average. I would say this is a must have for any city or general collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-06-11T17:50:47.327Z","4x4 is Awesome","This is what Lego should be making today. This set is a very cool jeep with a minifigure. I like the front of the jeep with the two front lights. It has no doors which is very cool and a good move by Lego. The wheels and tires are a good choice too. This set should be rereleased to show kids what 4x4's really are.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-24T13:57:51.09Z","Way too simple?","The minifig is very nice and it also comes with a radio which always help. However I think that the design of the jeep is very simple. But this was the times that you could build a vehicle out of virtually any brick, not just large single piece chunks you get nowadays, so bravo! No matter how simple this vehicle is I bet the young brainwashed Lego children nowadays will never figure out how to build these simple cars :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"sparticusjoe","2018-07-09T18:16:16.32Z","A fine civilian car for your Lego City. Nothing super special.","<p>This is one of those illustrious Lego sets that is neither good nor bad, it just is. It has a few design flaws that are easily enough rectified, it has exactly one play feature (It is a car, and kids like cars), and there really isn&#39;t a whole lot else to say about it. Considering my top rated review I&#39;ve ever written is on the poorly made pile known as &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; which only has ten pieces, I&#39;m not going to let that sop me from reviewing it anyways.</p>

<p><strong>THE MODEL</strong>: It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not Town Jr., which is certainly a big plus in its favor. It resembles a jeep somewhat at least. There&#39;s no seat for the driver which is odd, and the nineties Lego signature white rollbar is on the back of the model, but for the most part it&#39;s fine. Something that&#39;s sort of a design flaw in my eyes is the top of the hood of the car, which needs a 2x2 plate on it to re-enforce the headlights. Age and time makes them somewhat prone to snapping off, as they aren&#39;t held in place by anything but a single stud. But that&#39;s easily fixed and the rest of the vehicle looks fine. The minifigure included here seems like a likable chap, with the so-common-in-the-90&#39;s-it&#39;s-comical tier &quot;green jacket with white arms&quot; body, green pants, a red baseball cap, and a really neat face. Blue shades mixed with perma-stubble. My kinda guy, him.</p>

<p>The lone extra play feature included with this set is a walkie-talkie. Why does the civilian jeep driver have a walkie talkie? It&#39;s Lego, use your imagination, who knows! Maybe he&#39;s on an important mission. Maybe he just likes to gossip. Either way, there&#39;s no clip-bricks to attach the walkie talkie too, so if he ever sets down his radio it&#39;ll be lost among the undoubtable sea of other identical walkie talkie bricks you already have, and your set will never be complete again. Alas, would&#39;ve been nice to have a place for him to lay down his radio, his hand must get tired.</p>

<p><strong>THE BUILD EXPERIENCE</strong>: Great, but that&#39;s just because probably 90 percent of my Lego collection is Town Jr. sets with horrid build experiences. Unlike 95 percent of the cars released between 96 and 99, this jeep actually is made of more than a premade chassis and premade grill. It&#39;s got backing red lights built into the frame, two (weirdly close together) headlights in the front, and a cute little windshield made up of somewhat rare transparent ninety degree tile bricks. I wish Lego would&#39;ve kept making cars like this into the next few years of Town sets, but alas, they did not.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong>: It&#39;s a car. You&#39;re (probably) a kid if you bought this. Do the math. Kids love cars. You&#39;ll drive this poor fool off of couches, beds, and all sorts of mishaps. Playability is fine, but not any moreso than every other vehicle Lego&#39;s ever built. Lego sets are just innately playable unless they REALLY mess something up in the design phase (certainly not impossible, mind you, just rare). The displayability is pretty high. It&#39;s a sharp looking vehicle and a sharp looking minifig. I have him parked at the Truck Stop Cafe on my shelf display. Looks right at home in any civilian location just enjoying a day on the town.</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong>: You know it&#39;s not bad. Not great either, but not bad. The rarest parts are probably the transparent 90 degree tile bricks on the windshield, though they&#39;re not exactly rare, just rarer than everything else here. No printed pieces, though no stickers also. A nice example of building a simple, effective impulse set using just basic bricks. You can always use more basic bricks, of course, but there&#39;s no reason to buy this just to part it out.</p>

<p><strong>VALUE FOR THE MONEY</strong>: This set was cheap back then and it&#39;s still cheap on ebay and bricklink occasionally. For a five dollar impulse set it&#39;s great. You get a nice civilian cruiser jeep car thing to drive around your city and a nice civilian jeep cruiser driver guy to drive it. Can&#39;t complain there. It occasionally even turns up for sale in the USA (imagine that!) for reasonable prices so the expensive importation route isn&#39;t even totally necessary. It&#39;s worth picking up if you like the look of it, but the lack of any real exclusive or even rare parts and the lack of a whole lot extra to do with it hurts it somewhat. Recommended, but only lightly. Mostly nice as a nostalgia piece for the last year Lego pumped out Town sets without having to add the dreaded &quot;Jr.&quot; addition to them.</p>
