And, wow! That little thing really moves. Fast-forward to the next wave of Bikes and the one that caught my eye (like a few here at Brickset), was #60333-1 the Bathtub.</p>

<p>Now the point of this review is for #60341-1 - The Knockdown Challenge. I had an eye on this set anyway, particularly for the parts. Parts that I might need for a MOC. However, as I had bought 2 of the bikes previously, let&#39;s do things properly and road test the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build wise - it is really simple. I still like to follow along with the booklet, and the build process was about 10 minutes. The parts were decent. New to me are the black and orange ramps. The cake moulds, and the glow-in-the-dark stars and round tiles. The Bike in this set is the same frame as the Rocket Racer one, but in black with a nice printed star on either side. The bike rider mini-figure is superb! In a stylish white jacket with star prints that follow onto the front of the legs. Her helmet part is new to me also. The figure comes with a blue hairpiece, that when you switch the&nbsp;helmet, the helmet has 2 holes to allow for hair braids&nbsp;to&nbsp;attach in place, and the result is very striking (the hair extensions also new parts to me). The other figure (I believe they have names, but I don&#39;t follow City that much yet!), is decent and serves as a mechanic to the Star rider, and comes with a wrench. He&#39;s nice to have in the set, but also serves no purpose (though I might let him have a go on one of the bikes he repairs!)</p>

<p>Once built - the point is to race the bike with the aim of knocking down one of 3 cakes suspended upon 3 swinging bars. These are simple builds&nbsp;but effectively achieved&nbsp;via some Technic pins.&nbsp;(I made a small gap at the join to really allow them to swing!)</p>

<p>THIS is where the fun begins. It is harder than it looks! I invited my partner (an emerging AFOL), and our daughter (who at 17, rolled her eyes at me before accepting the challenge of the challenge).</p>

<p>The Challenge of the Challenge - I had set this up on a 6ft decorating table covered in a vinyl cloth. The bikes start point around 3ft from the frame. The aim -&nbsp;Race all 3 bikes to knock down the 3 cakes in only&nbsp;3 attempts!</p>

<p>The short version is that we all had a blast. Yes the challenge was achieved... eventually. Sure the bikes often left the table and needed repairing. But, no parts were lost, or mini-figures hurt during the challenge.</p>

<p>Overall - None of my family are the target audience, but it is GREAT&nbsp;fun.</p>

<p>I bought this set at &pound;9.99, and I would recommend this set at this&nbsp;sale price. The RRP of &pound;17.99 feels steep and for me of less value. Likewise for the bike packs.</p>

<p>P.s - Writing a review is hard... Credit to Hugh and the crew of Brickset for doing such a sterling job.&nbsp;</p>
