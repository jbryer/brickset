<p>I bought the set for the brown chickens but in the end it turned out to be a pleasant small build. This goes for the henhouse as well as for the quad bike.</p>

<p>The set provides bright colours, pleasant bricks (nothing too greebly) and the blue parts for the quad bike are cheerful. And there are of course the brown chickens.</p>

<p>It is regrettable once again however how infantile and dumbdumbed down the building instructions are. There is even a drawing about the fact that you need to shake the bricks out of the bag. Seriously...?&nbsp;And numbers are gone as well. The instructions show 4x a specific brick when you need it 4 times. The set is 5+. I am more than certain that a child of 5 can count/read a number up to 10.</p>

<p>I do wonder however how those small chickens won&#39;t settle for less than an ostrich egg when it comes to their hen fruit&nbsp;production.</p>

<p>The highlight of this set is the inclusion of <strong>2 chickens and a farmer girl minifig</strong>.</p>

<p>The henhouse build is small but well-thought-out and <em>easy&nbsp;to expand</em> if you buy multiple of this set. There is also a play feature of <strong>removable egg-drawer</strong>. An 8x8 bright-green plate is also a nice addition.</p>

<p>The ATV has a play feature of &quot;working&quot; suspension, but it doesn&#39;t move a lot and makes the vehicle&nbsp;way oversized for minifig scale. It would be better if there was a steering wheel included instead of the handlebar, as this would make the vehicle&nbsp;a normal-sized&nbsp;buggy.</p>

<p>Still I believe that this set is well worth buying even if only for the chickens and farm-girl minifigure.</p>
