<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>The minifigures are pretty good. The farmer provided is excellent, and I love his overalls. His legs are a bit disappointing as they lack any printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The female minifigure provided is a bit plain in terms of torso and legs but has a pretty unique hairpiece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The non-farmer male minifigure is pretty generic but fits right at home in any Lego city.</p>

<p>A rabbit is also included and it looks fantastic.</p>

<p>Van:<br />
The van included in the set is great. The cab of the vehicle is quite large and the back part of the truck is also amazingly spacious. I especially love its sliding window and double doors. There is room for two figures in the back as well as room for the two crates of vegetables provided, a small crate of peppers, and a small cash register. The only thing I dislike about the van is its roof which is a bare plate with a large carrot on top. The large carrot decoration looks good but I wish it looked less square in the middle and I wish the top of the van had less exposed studs.</p>

<p>Crops:</p>

<p>The crop field provided is a tab luckluster. I like the water pump and the larger crops but the structure they rest on could have been better designed. Gaps are visible when it is viewed from behind and the two main pieces don&#39;t fit together as tight as I would like. You do get a great selection of crop, though, with a pumpkin, banana, apples, grapes, corn, peppers, and carrots being provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>This set is pretty easy to build, and the three stickers included are easily applied to their respective pieces.</p>

<p>Play Value:</p>

<p>This set has lots of play value, including a feature that makes it look like the carrots are growing. The van has many features on it which also increase play value.</p>

<p>Display:</p>

<p>This set is ok for display but I would recommend buying it for the van and using the crop pieces to build one&#39;s own farm or field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have to agree with the official Brickset review that this set is pricey in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
