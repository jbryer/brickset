I described my disappointment of the 2021 calendar in a detailed review - perhaps the Lego City designer team have also read that, because seemingly they have resolved lots of the mentioned issues this year&nbsp;:P Or have they? Let&#39;s take a closer look...</p>

<h2>Box</h2>

<p>The box looks festive as usual, presenting some builds in a holiday setting and the names of the characters. One of the most annoying issue with last year&#39;s calendar was the tremendous amount of spoilers included throughout the box, leaving only 3 of the 24 gifts as a surprise. We clearly have an improvement here: the box art spoils &#39;only&#39; 14 gifts, and some gifts are even missing from&nbsp;the official thumbnail, so you have some surprises even after looking at some online images of the set! This is certainly a positive.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Six minifigs are included, which is not bad, but it could have been more if you take a look at older calendars. However, the selection is more special this time: the highlight could be Tippy Doorman, who is exclusive to this set, and his torso has appeared only once before, in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60200-1/Capital-City"">60200</a> Capital City. The minifig itself also looks splendid with the mischievous smile and exclusive dark red epaulettes, so it is a welcome addition. In fact, all the other figures make their second appearance here: Mr. Produc&eacute; made his debut in the blatantly overpriced <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60347-1/Grocery-Store"">60347</a>&nbsp;Grocery Store, Billy and Maddy only appeared before in the ridiculously dumbed down and expensive&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60329-1/School-Day"">60329</a> School Day, and Raze could not be seen before elsewhere as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60296-1/Wheelie-Stunt-Bike"">60296</a> Wheelie Stunt Bike (which is also overpriced I think :D ). It is great to see such good-looking minifigs in a set that is not shamelessly overpriced, particularly because such civilian characters are always useful in a City setting. Our most festive figure, Santa Claus (finally the REAL one, not some Lego City Adventures character in a Santa costume) is almost identical to his colleague in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10293-1/Santa-s-Visit"">10293</a> Santa&#39;s Visit, the only difference being his legs. It would have been great to see the dual-coloured black-red legs here too, but Father Christmas looks good as he is. Overall, the minifig selection is impressive, albeit their amount is a bit of a letdown.</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>After 17 years of City calendars it is not easy to come up with new ideas every year, but I think the designers have done a good job here. The number of microbuilds was cut drastically this year, as we get three toys: a police chopper, a passenger train and a space rocket, all nods to existing City sets (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60317-1/Police-Chase-at-the-Bank"">60317</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60337-1/Express-Passenger-Train"">60337</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60351-1/Rocket-Launch-Centre"">60351</a>, respectively). All the models look great and are instantly recognisable - and they do not feel repetitive at all! This year the calendar also takes us to the countryside, which was an untouched theme in City calendars until now, but I think it works nicely. The birdhouse and the rocking horse are amongst my favourite builds in this calendar, as they are designed nicely and bring some novelty to the calendar. The checkerboard with fence, festive chicken nest(?) and scarecrow fell a bit odd, but they are certainly original ideas too. And we have lots of animals: a gray kitten, a brown hen, a white bird and an exclusive white foal! These are great additions, especially that most of them are new moulds for this year. All the other builds are related to Christmas somehow: the mailbox with letter (presumably for Santa), the Christmas market stands, the skating scene with an ice resurfacing machine, the campfire, the Christmas tree and the decorated lamppost&nbsp;are all nice builds, I especially like Santa&#39;s sleigh and the piano. The second market stand with the cake seems odd however, as the legs of the table has the same colour as the cake dough.</p>

<h2>The completed set</h2>

<p>We have a nice amount of stuff by day 24 with some great builds, nice minifigs and lots of animals, which is positive. The builds are also connected to each other with some common themes (farm, market, skating, Santa with sleigh and foal etc.), which is also a big plus, last year&#39;s calendar had little-to-no cohesion. But looking at all the content of the calendar feels a bit odd somehow - maybe because we have some &#39;oddball&#39; builds amongst&nbsp;the gifts. The overall amount seems average compared to other calendars.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>I had mostly positive words about this calendar until now: after two strange calendars heavily relying on Lego City Adventures and identical microbuilds, this year we have a solid calendar with lots of nice builds, minifigs, pieces and animals. I think the City calendar is back on the right track (but I&#39;m not the main target audience, so who am I to decide this :P ). My biggest complaint is the price hike: $35/25&euro; means 5 bucks increase compared to last year, which is by no means justified considering that last year&#39;s calendar had 62 more pieces. Moreover, the first calendar in 2005 cost only $15 according to Brickset, and the inflation was nowhere near 133% in these 17 years! Increasing the price of the cheapest Lego calendar so harshly makes Lego more hardly available for less wealthy families, which is a bad thing. My smaller complaints are the sheer number of minifigs and the oddity of some builds. In conclusion, I think we finally have another solid City calendar after 2-3 years, though it is better to wait for a discount since it is a bit expensive at full price.</p>
