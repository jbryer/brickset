I really thought I would like it, but the instructions (via app) don&#39;t work, and your phone gets heated really quickly. You also can&#39;t go back easy in the app when you change to another app in the meantime. The pieces are OK and some are very nice. But the build isn&#39;t complete. You have to use your own imagination, but meh. I would recommend buying something else.&nbsp;</p>

I spent more time fiddling around with my own designs than following the instructions. That&#39;s a first for me since getting back into LEGO as an adult. I truly felt like I was &#39;playing with LEGO&#39; rather than just mindlessly following instructions. LEGO has something special here, and I hope this line continues.</p>

<p>The value here is good, especially at the $32 I paid. You get a decent starting point with the ship, and the bonus builds at the end of each mission were a nice touch. There&#39;s a great selection of extra parts to do as you please. I loved seeing some parts that I haven&#39;t seen since I was a kid, particularly the two different types of boosters.</p>

<p>The minifigures are simply amazing. I have the full wave of recent space sets currently unbuilt, so it was nice to get some extras here. I like them so much, I might just get another copy of this set just for them.</p>

<p>While I can see the appeal of using the app for kids, there really should at least be PDF instructions or a physical booklet. Not everyone has access to or wants to use a tablet or smartphone and more options are always better. But for me, the app was mildly entertaining.</p>
