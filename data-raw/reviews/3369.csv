"Blade","2007-08-06T11:08:18.3Z","Company Copter","Found the first half of this guy yesterday and just found the other half now. I won't mark a model as &quot;I own&quot; or write it a review until i have located it and completed it correctly. So now it's time for its review.

First thing i would like to point out is the name of this model &quot;Stunt Copter&quot; As it is from the Octan fuel set im doubtful it is for stunts, rather for surveying or something for the company. 

The copter itself is great. Simple, yet solid. Not over weighted, rotor spins well and the mini-fig's hands line up with the gear sticks well. The colour scheme is traditional with the Octan company across the model and Mini-fig. The fig has the Octan logo on him, with the new style helmet.

My only real annoyance is once again those bloody stickers. I put this model together originally some 13 years ago when i was seven and in the excitement the stickers aren't straight. This is a prime example of why i hate them. Do i remove them and re-straighten them? If I do part of the sticker wont stick due to 13 years of dust and rubbish from play. But would the re-stick at all? If not im left without. Seriously LEGO print the damn things on!

Now if got that of my chest, overall its a great little helicopter and personally im glad i got to be the one to review this one first as i feel it deserves a 7/10. A good addition to the helicopter fan or a city or Octan fan. Pick this one up if you haven't already.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Plus, it has a lot of good pieces that can be useful for other vehicles. I built an Octan race car with this, some wheels and a couple other small pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"James83","2013-01-04T06:50:11.5Z","Basic But Fun to Fly","<p>This little helicopter was an inexpensive addition to my small aircraft collection and actually looks quite good despite its simplicity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>A basic and quick build. However, it looks good, the sloped chassis looks sporty and the Octan colours make a nice colour combination. The pilot has twin sticks and small windscreen/ crash barrier on the front. There are twin engine exhausts for some realism and the rotors and tail rotor are standard fixtures of any Lego helicopter. The Octan blades were ok, but were flimsy, as all the Lego helicopter blades were. The green vents on the other blades are ok, but don't look that good. The red 1x1 flat brick on the small sloped brick at the tail should really have been a red light brick but this can be easily altered. The skids are stable and sturdy enough, but with acrobatics might fall off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>An Octan employee with the usual green trousers and Octan body but with a red helmet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>A good helicopter, which although cheap and basic wasn't too inferior to other helicopters and actually looks ok. It is easy to copy too so you can build competing stunt helicopters for a competition too. Not a design classic but&nbsp;a solidly good set.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4

I am a big fan of Octan,so this is a joy for me that i own this set. I have other sets that i am rebuilding,but i found out that i ammissing minifigures from some sets! I was bummed about it for a few days,because i loved lego-s when i was a kid. And now i am coming back to them i n a new perspective.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
