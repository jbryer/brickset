Minecraft is a sandbox game, so I think the best of Lego&#39;s sets best embody those sandbox elements. Most fans who play the game will look at sets like this from that perspective and will appreciate the details present - especially for a set based on the Nether, where a small detail can draw the line between survival and death in-game.</p>

<p>In Minecraft, a <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bastion_Remnant"">Bastion Remnant</a> is a large, black, stone fortress occupied by hostile mobs. Players raid these structures for treasure in chests and rare blocks built into the walls, but they are incredibly dangerous without proper armor and preparations. From that perspective, I think these are the greatest strengths of the set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two Nether biomes (<a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Warped_Forest"">Warped Forest</a> and <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Basalt_Deltas"">Basalt Deltas</a>) from the 1.16 update are distinctly included.</li>
	<li>The Player&#39;s <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Netherite"">Netherrite</a> sword and helmet are fantastic additions.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Strider"">Strider</a> is adorable and the saddle is removable too. Its body can rock back and forth on its legs, just like its walking animation in-game.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Piglin"">Piglin</a> is not new but the minifigure looks great. The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Piglin_Brute"">Piglin Brute</a>, however, looks fantastic and even has the eye scar and axe from the game.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Magma_Cube"">magma cube</a>&#39;s design is slightly new but is still consistent with previous magma cubes.</li>
	<li>All of the <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fungus"">warped fungi</a> pieces can be mounted to the fishing pole, just like the <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Warped_Fungus_on_a_Stick"">warped fungus on a stick</a> that the Player holds. There are enough extra pieces to make a second one.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Torch"">soul torches</a> and <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fire"">soul fire</a> not only look fantastic but are a welcome addition considering that piglins hate going near them. It makes sense the Player would have some soul torches on hand when approaching the bastion.</li>
	<li>The basalt columns look great with the unique 2x2 bricks.</li>
	<li>The treasure in the bastion is great - netherrite ingots, netherrite scraps, and gold blocks. There may also be a piece of bread, but the item is hard to identify.</li>
	<li>There is plenty of <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_Wart"">nether wart</a> in various stages of growth and it looks fantastic, especially compared to previous nether wart builds in earlier Lego Minecraft sets.</li>
	<li>The TNT explosion function is nothing new to Minecraft sets, and while blowing up the side of a bastion may not be the <em>smartest</em> idea in-game, <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Blackstone"">blackstone</a> does have a low blast resistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>This set seems to suggest that the Player&#39;s strategy is to ride a Strider into the fortress, loot the chest, fight the piglins, and blow open the walls to get to the gold - all potential ways to successfully complete the challenge. However, I think the set has some key details missing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bastion remnants are <em>massive </em>structures with tons of different rooms. The ruins in this set barely represent a Housing Unit and a Treasure Room, they are far too small to really do the structure justice. I understand the price point is a constraint, but for $35, some more Bastion bits would be more than welcome.</li>
	<li>The new Player skin looks alright, but the colors more resemble the <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Warden"">Warden</a> (which has no connection to the Nether) and the pants are not printed.</li>
	<li>A piece of gold armor for the player would be a welcome addition, as piglins are not hostile to players who wear gold. Having this piece would add another play possibility to the set.</li>
	<li>The <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Gilded_Blackstone"">gilded blackstone</a> and <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_Gold_Ore"">nether gold ore</a> can&#39;t be obtained by the player without a pickax, which is not included in the set. This is a more minor issue but these blocks are considered loot by players, and the addition of a pickax would add another play possibility to the set.</li>
	<li>One of the most coveted treasures in bastions is the iconic <a href=""https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Music_Disc"">&quot;Pigstep&quot; music disk</a>, which is surprisingly absent from this set. It is the only music disk that cannot be obtained outside of the Nether and appears in no other Nether structures. This would be a fantastic addition to the set and feels like a greatly missed opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, I would recommend this set to a Minecraft fan, but only on sale. There are many great elements to the set, but the bastion remnant feels too incomplete to justify the $35 price tag. At a lower price point however, the selection of Nether elements and mobs is fantastic and worth adding to your collection.</p>
