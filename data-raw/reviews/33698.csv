So i find it&nbsp;kind of interesting that it took eight years to get a spawner or dungeon specifically&nbsp;for them. Not that I&#39;m complaining because&nbsp;this set is game accurate and very well polished.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the play features are very well hidden away and don&#39;t take away from the looks of the finished model.&nbsp;The mechanism used to &#39;spawn&#39; skeletons&nbsp;by hiding them away&nbsp;is quite simple but very&nbsp;effective in giving the effect&nbsp;of a&nbsp;skeleton spawning out of thin air. (Or out of the walls in this case.)&nbsp;One can also rotate the mini skeleton seen in the dungeon via a&nbsp;technique that has been seen before in other older sets.</p>

<p>This set&nbsp;brings&nbsp;our first dripstone cave representation which brings us to&nbsp;the other main play feature of the set;&nbsp;the&nbsp;ability to make the&nbsp;stalactites (connected to a dripstone block)&nbsp;fall on your skeleton enemies. &nbsp;This is accomplished by sliding a&nbsp;lever&nbsp;in the back and then&nbsp;letting gravity cause&nbsp;two&nbsp;small subassemblies&nbsp;held in place through technic bricks&nbsp;to fall. This is similar to the&nbsp;technique&nbsp;used for&nbsp;a representation of gravel falling&nbsp;in a couple past sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21183-1/The-Training-Grounds"">21183</a> brought us some features of a lush cave, we were lacking a one in its naturally generated state. This set brings us at least part of that biome by&nbsp;bringing&nbsp;us our first appearance of clay in sand blue and the first appearance of dripleaf plants.&nbsp;I really like how the candle piece makes up the stem because it allows for one to easily make the dripleaf taller by simply adding&nbsp;more candle pieces. (Though only one bright green candle is included.)&nbsp;Other details&nbsp;of this set&#39;s lush cave include a couple of azalea bushes, a&nbsp;spore blossom, and some regular grass stalks that can also be found underground in this biome.</p>

<p>One thing that does confuse me a little is the use of 1x1 flat with 1/2 circle&nbsp;tiles on the blue plate itself.&nbsp;I first see lillypads,&nbsp;but lillypads were accomplished through the use of 2 of these pieces&nbsp;and 2 round 1x1 corner tiles in regular green in past sets. 4 of the 1x1 with 1/2 circle&nbsp;tiles in bright green were&nbsp;used here. I suppose it could be waterlogged dripleaf since that subassembly uses the same rounded&nbsp;tiles, but I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>Rare or unique parts found in this set include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>3x Dark Green&nbsp;PLATE 1X1, W/ 3.2 SHAFT AND 1.5 HOLE&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<p>Figures include 3 skeletons and 1 player skin&nbsp;figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this set was $30 USD, then I&#39;d say it would be&nbsp;pretty much perfect with all of its&nbsp;game accurate details and play features. I&nbsp;don&#39;t find&nbsp;the $35 pricetag for 364 pieces&nbsp;to be too horrible though for what you get though.&nbsp;</p>
