"eggbert20","2007-06-23T04:49:46.983Z","For the price, it's well worth it...","I bought this set when it first came out. The main reason I bought it was to get the awesome new spaceman with the gold visor. The buggy was just a bonus. I think when this set first came out it was around 3 or 4 dollars. It was well worth it. By itself, there's not much you can do with it. But add it to some of the other space sets in this series, and it shines.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loop","2008-01-29T19:11:53.983Z","Almost...","This set has only one good thing - the astronaut minifig with the silverish visor. Apart from that there is nothing special here. The buggy is very plain and small, not many bricks are used here. You won't find any interesting bricks also. The small blue radar dish is the most uncommon thing here. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-06-10T02:46:19.81Z","Not all it seems...","Looking at other peoples reviews of this model and from my younger self's point of view, yes this model dose seem quite plain small and boring. I too bought this originally for the new space man visor as I didn't have one yet. Now I am glad I did as it has so much more.

Firstly the size is quite small, but I find this is good, as too many space vehicles are too bulky, wide and could not go some of the places this little one could.

Secondly it has a fully adjustable light at the front. How many other vehicles have a moveable light or lights at the front?

Thirdly LEGO went the extra with the space vehicle, as they should, and gave the vehicle not only a steering wheel but a control panel with gauges as well. Something I would like to see on more models but this is one of a few.

Fourthly on his other side you have a space blaster that is mounted in a very convenient place, allowing the mini-fig to grab and use while on the move. Can't do that is its clipped on at the back.

Fifthly you get a nice small blue radar disk which just complements the vehicle quite nicely.

Finally the mini-fig himself with his cool gold, reflective visor, dressed in an all white space suit, with oxygen tank on his back and space things printed on his front.

Overall this set has a lot of things which people over seem to over look very easily. I feel this set is definitely above average and worthy of a 6/10. A good addition to any space collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"szerman","2009-12-22T03:06:49.903Z","not bad","This small set has some interesting pieces. The looks is quite ugly in my opinion, but the minifig, trans dark blue(?) round aerial, the computer and something what is a grey radar with red-black aerials I think are very cool. In 1996 or 1997 the cost of him was 10zl (zlotys) in Poland = about 2,5-3,5$ then. I'm sorry for my English :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"J_tje","2010-03-14T03:26:12.23Z","The Odd set out","Why this moon buggy was released in the Town/Launch command series still eludes me. It would have a much better place in the space command series than in this one.<br><br>First off all, this set just looks silly sitting next to the earth based launching pads (1682 / 6339). There is no believable way to make it fit in one of the shuttles cargo bays . (Trust me, I tried).<br><br>Secondly it's a very simple (I find it boring) design and the astronauts ""special"" tool keeps on falling of.<br><br>",TRUE,2,3,2,3,2
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-04-26T03:50:21.263Z","Chrome Dome","<p>Launch Command provided an exciting new array of Town based space activity, allowing Space theme fans the chance to create an origin for their future set science fiction sets.&nbsp;Here is the pocket money set: the moon buggy with an astronaut.</p>

	<li>Excellent print of gear and the Launch Command badge.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Serious eyebrows and mouthpiece head print.</li>
	<li>Exciting large gold chrome visor.</li>
</ul>

<div><b>Walking On The Moon</b><br />
For such a tiny lunar vehicle it offers a fair bit of kit. Obviously in white, the front features a safety bar with a clipped on square light (no doubt for the moon&#39;s dark side).&nbsp;The driver is simply set back and placed behind his blue steering wheel with a control panel printed smooth tile to one side and a clip holding a strange device on the other. Some kind of scanner, it has some alternatively coloured antennae on a modified blaster of sorts. The back ends in a blue angle and a clipped on tall aerial that holds unusually, not a realistic grey, white or black radar dish but a transparent blue one, reminiscent of the sci-fi technology in the old Space theme. Sadly the most lacking feature is buggy wheels!</div>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>So it has just a set of hubcapped Town wheels, a futuristic radar dish and no seat but this does not ruin it by any means. The star here was the new astronaut and the use of gold chrome on a large, more realistic visor. The use of the chunky buggy tyres would have really authenticated it but as a character and motor combination set it retains plenty of play value and fits in well with other sets from the subtheme but is by no means the best, offered,&nbsp;see <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6463-1/Lunar-Rover"">https://brickset.com/sets/6463-1/Lunar-Rover</a>&nbsp;for a superior&nbsp;buggy,&nbsp;may they make another still for a better likeness to Nasa&#39;s.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Shiny, Shiny</b><br />
Mostly an excellent minifigure with substandard vehicle and his one pure gold piece to cause &#39;new visor syndrome&#39; - careful not to scratch it up. But he came with other sets so this is a happy pocket money set yet an&nbsp;unessential buy.</div>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-13T13:03:45.867Z","Astronauts on the Moon","<p>Set #6516 Moon Walker: The second set I owned from Launch Command, I only had two, this little impulse style set is easily forgettable except for the fact that it came with an Astronaut with gold face shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Moon Walker model is a small four wheeled buggy used to travel on the moon, it is simple and fast to build, it is also simple and easy to make up from existing pieces from other collections, unfortunately you won't have those Launch Command colors. There really isn't much to this model, but it is definitely a joy to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is one of the nicer ones out of LEGO Town. An Astronaut with all white, including gloves, a face print with communication device included a white oxygen tank and the golden helmet shield to protect the eyes of your Astronaut from the cosmic interstellar rays of the Sun when in Outer Space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alone, you can't do much with it, add it as part of your Launch Command or other Town/City based Space Sets and you can't go wrong. In fact I'd dare say that this little set is a worthy addition of LEGO Space Themes. I recommend it as a cheap method of getting yourself an Astronaut Mini-Figure.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
