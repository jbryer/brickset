A true nightmare! And I do understand that a lot of concessions were made to give it its unique shape, however, a lot of parts barely stay in place,&nbsp;many of the attachments had to be made in very narrow places, or the instructions didn&#39;t give normal explanations of where and how to attach this or that part, and don&#39;t forget&nbsp;the numerous typing errors in the instructions.</p>

<p>Now for the Pros: you assemble the Lego set in a similar schedule that Ferrari builds the Daytona. First, the V-12 engine, eight-speed gearbox, and rear suspension, then you move on to the front suspension and steering. You finish up with the red body panels that give the model the organic flow of the real car, which takes its design cues from the sumptuous lines of the Ferraris that won the 1967 Daytona 24-hour race.</p>

<p>New parts:&nbsp;Lego ultimately created 12 new parts during the development of the Daytona SP3 Technic kit. This included aesthetic pieces, such as the model&#39;s exterior panels and wheels, as well as more mechanical ones, including new plastic gears designed to improve the functional feel of the scaled-down Ferrari&#39;s moving parts.</p>

<p>And thankfully, the final build is well worth the toil. At two feet in length, this car is large and in charge. Technic parts can easily replicate the many interwoven curves of sports cars and the like, and this set is a testament to that ability. The super aerodynamic design is faithfully rendered on every nook and cranny.</p>
