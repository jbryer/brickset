<p>As a child I <em>missed</em> the first two helicopters from <em>Technic</em> line (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/852-1"">852</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8844-1"">8844</a>). However, I built a battery powered (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/870-1"">870</a>) version of the latter.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s I bought <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8856-1"">8856</a>. I soon found the set up of the rotor lacking the realism and modified it using hints from <a href=""https://brickshelf.com/"">Brickshelf</a> and <a href=""https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/forum/115-lego-technic-mindstorms-model-team-and-scale-modeling/"">Eurobrick forum</a>:</p>

<h3>The Set</h3>

<p>The box and the tray (40 x 60 cm&sup2;) I used for building:</p>

<p><img alt=""set box"" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42145/005_wrn_220911_161737.png"" style=""width: 457px; height: 640px;"" /></p>

<p>The box is filled to 70..80 %. Building will be divided into 5 steps.</p>

<p><img alt=""box content"" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42145/011_wrn_220911_162045.png"" style=""width: 640px; height: 520px;"" /></p>

<p>The instruction book is provided in a cardboard envelope rather that a plastic bag together with two sticker sheets.</p>

<h3><em>Side note</em>: The Battery Box</h3>

<p>The battery box from this set has same functions as the one from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42113-1"">42113</a>: There are two sockets to connect two motors and two switches: one for each motor.</p>

<p><img alt=""battery box"" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42145/105_wrn_220911_163220.png"" style=""width: 480px; height: 352px;"" /></p>

<p>You cannot stick an axle through both switches from either side to power both sockets at the same time.</p>

<p>To access the battery holder inside the box you will need a tool <strong>which is not provided with the set</strong>. (even the cheapest HDD and SSD cases I bought had a suitable tool!)&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have used a Philips no 1 crosshair screwdriver (&quot;+&quot;-type, not the &quot;X&quot;-ytep ;-)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42145/102_wrn_220911_162759.png"" /></p>

<p>The inside battery tray can be exchanged with former Control+ hubs (e.g. clip version from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42114-1"">42114</a>).</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>The model is started from the bottom with battery box and landing gear (1). I found the mechanism annoying as it prevented to put the module flat on an even surface.<br />
Then the levers and transmission for the collective and cyclic control are assembled (2). It&#39;s difficult to notice what all the moving parts will eventually be used for.</p>

<p>(<em>In step 142 a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6209519/con-bush-2m-fr-cross-axle"">3L red friction pin</a> is inserted into two beams. In step 143 a 8-tooth&nbsp; gear is added that connects to the axle of the cyclic control. I found this very stiff, almost not turning at all. Instead the beams were twisting. I therefore replace the 3L red pin by a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6089119/"">3L black one</a>.</em>)</p>

<p>Step 2 also defines the front section of the helicopter. (You&#39;ll find the 19M black soft axle in the bag with the rotor blades.)</p>

<p>Step 3 is where all the gears are happening and the rotor mast is set up. This will start as a separate unit that will be connected with the chassis from steps 1+2. To me this required the most attention.</p>

<p>Next you will be asked to set up the tail (4). Although it appears to be quite solid by itself a weak spot will show later. Then the rotor head is set up. This will give you a good impression of the models size.</p>

<p>In the last step (5) the engine covers are built.They are setup to slide on axles to get a better look on the mechanics of pitch control.<br />
There is some &#39;wing&#39; type thing at the rear that looks awkward as the designers tried to match with the real helicopter.</p>

<p>(I divided building time into 4 or 5 sessions over 6 days.)</p>

<h3>My Impression(s)</h3>

<p>The designers have captured the functions of a helicopter quite well. I also like the colourful appearance.<br />
I mainly bought the set to compare with other technic aircraft that I have previously built, and also to get the new parts.</p>

<p>When you engage high speed mode of rotor rotation you always get a whining noise from the motor. You would think that it is possible to include some soft-start electronics either in the motor or battery box that ramp um the speed from 0 to max.</p>

<h3>Not-so-good Items</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Overall appearance reminds me of my modified <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8856-1"">8856</a> (see above) from the 2000s:<br />
	The rotor mast is way too high and also the engine area appears not realistic.</li>
	<li>Vibrant yellow pieces could be a nice touch but appear translucent. This is very obvious at the diagonal panel.<br />
	Do we really need another colour hue of technic elements?</li>
	<li>I really - really - despise the colour (bright blue, dark azure, green) of the new gears.<br />
	Are fellow (junior?) builders not able to distinguish parts from their size but need colour coding instead?</li>
	<li>Sagging of the tail:<br />
	<img alt="""" src=""https://brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42145/204_wr_35745.png"" /></li>
	<li>The control rods to that change the rotor blade pitch are touching the housing left and right at each revolution.</li>
	<li>The levers for cyclic control also seem to touch the cover over the cabin as you can see it moving.</li>
	<li>The black parts might be concealing details of the cabin area (intentional?) - I don&#39;t like it very much.</li>
	<li>Rear landing wheel are (also) sagging from weight (see picture above).</li>
</ul>
