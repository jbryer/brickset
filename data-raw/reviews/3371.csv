They're the Thing, that was missing in Lego Town until 1996, when this set came out. Those jet ski's look very realistic altough this one looks a bit like jet skis from some stunt Shows. It's just a little bit too coloured. But this is my only, yet minor drawback. The minifig is cool, looks like a stuntman, which makes the guy fitting to the set. The buoys are a nice touch for this little set. And those handlebars work really great for Jet skis and for 
snowcats.
Just a 10/10 to me",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-03-30T21:35:52.53Z","LEGO Jet Ski","Put this one together this morning and figure it can have a review too. This is another one of those classic under $5 sets that fits into the town and racing category. It really is a jet ski or sea do and for a LEGO model it looks quite impressive.

The colour scheme is quite nice being red blue and white, making it stand out more in your collection. Also it has some neat little parts that aren't too common today. The model is great because the number 3 and the three large stars are printed on which is great, but the starts on the side are stickers! Like if it's not bad enough that most of us hate stickers, they couldn't even make up their minds weather to sticker this model or not, so they just did both. The vehicle is controlled by handlebars that hinge.

The mini fig is all dressed in red, with two starts on his red jacket. He has a yellow life vest and his helmet is blue, with stars and stripes on it. The visor is a sky blue colour. His face is a smiley face with sunglasses, which is a favourite of mine.

The other thing that comes with this model is two markers, one red, one green. They can be used to mark out a race track or used as a safety device. The best thing about them is they are very simple to make and you can make more from your existing pieces.

Overall this model is quite nice with good aesthetics and an average playability. It has some small pro's but those are brought down by the stickers thing. I feel this model is a 5/10 or Average and would recommend it to anyone who likes town or sea models.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-24T09:25:19.117Z","LEGO Town (Leisure) - Water Jet Review","<p>This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some very cool parts. I love the big blue slope piece with the red stars on it and I also like the piece with the number 3 on it. All pieces we get are very nice for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig looks very neat. The figure has a red overall, a blue helmet, black shades on his face and he also has a yellow life jacket.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p><span>The build is very fun and easy and we only get two stickers to put on. The stars on the big blue slope are printed and the red 3 is printed on the big white piece as well.</span></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6517-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't have any play features but it's still fun to maneuver it. We also get two buoys with this set which look really cool. I haven't tried to check if this model floats but I think it won't float on water. <br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T04:09:03.75Z","More Fun On The Water…","I love everything about this set from the minifig with his red suit, shades and star-studded helmet right down to the actual Jet Ski itself.   The design is uncomplicated and represents the real thing very well, even those handlebars look realistic and at the stern of the craft there appears to be the twin jets which protrude out from underneath the craft.   Also include in this set are two marker buoys with red and green lanterns.   These can be used for racing purposes or to mark out a channel possibly for entry to a marina or port and the best part about these … the bases which the buoys are mounted on allow for a certain degree of ‘rock’ when touched.   This can give the feeling of them actually floating on water!

I have two of these in my collection and they both look great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-23T20:21:37.79Z","Ride the waves.","Here's an easy way to make some quick LEGO bucks: first, design a set that features a couple of cool vehicles, and then supplement that with an impulse set that is exactly one of the vehicles from the larger set, though perhaps with minor cosmetic modifications. Naturally, I'm talking about Water Jet's symbiotic relationship with Wave Jump Racers (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6334-1"">6334</a>), in which buying either one of these sets will probably result in you inevitably buying the other. Just according to keikaku.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Fortunately, Wave Jump Racers is actually a pretty cool set on its own, and considering that Water Jet retailed for just $3, it's kind of easy to forgive this cash grab from LEGO (after all, haven't we so willingly parted with so much of our cash to TLG already?). Much like Train Station (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=7937-1"">7937</a>), for example, it's very difficult to judge this set on its own merits since there's not a whole lot of fun you can have with a single jetski all by its lonesome; yet, it works perfectly with the complement of racers included in Wave Jump Racers, which, as mentioned, are for all intents and purposes identical to this one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But if, for some reason, you have no desire to get Wave Jump Racers are instead simply looking for a small jetski to augment your marina/beachfront display, you really can't go wrong with this. It's simple, elegant, and its stylish angles means that this set has aged well and will fit in nicely into a modern display. The Minifig is fun and functional - surprisingly, I actually still have this guy, and the best thing about him is probably his printed helmet, which seems to have mostly survived my childhood intact (which maybe is more than I can say for myself). Of course, if you're planning on recreating this on your own, there's nothing thematically sacred about him and just about any other Minifig will work with this jetski. The only downside? Silly triangular stickers (the blue stars) that adorn the side of the jetski. Needless to say, those can be safely ignored.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Water Jet is a fun little set and among the better ""small boat""-type sets that are out there, so it's sure to find a loving home in your marina, should you have one or are planning to build one. Just don't be shocked if you soon find yourself looking to augment this guy with 6334, though. Like I said: easy LEGO money.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,3
