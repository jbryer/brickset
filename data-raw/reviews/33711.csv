<p>Besides the fact that I love the sets, here&#39;s why bothered to write and why I titled this review &quot;Extra Dots are the example&quot; -- these polybags have a window in the lower right corner that lets you preview the &quot;surprise&quot; dots inside.&nbsp; I wish the CMF figures did this!&nbsp; I would be happy if the Extra Dots contained the same number of printed tiles in each bag if there were no window because you would still know what you&#39;re getting.&nbsp; But because Lego mixes them up, the window is my key to picking the bags that have the printed tiles I want.&nbsp; You might have to make some tradeoffs in finding a bag that has a tile you may not care for, but you know what you&#39;re getting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was able to pick a bag that had three soccer ball tiles and two track shoe tiles.&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I have three boys who all played high school soccer and two of them ran on the track team.&nbsp; It&#39;s like the Lego sorting machine was thinking of me when it filled this bag!&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Maybe you want the roller skate or the sloth, you can find them inside with the window.</p>
