"Blade","2007-08-06T10:37:30.317Z","Beach Cruzer","Put this one together today and I'm glad i did, as now can be the first to review this killer buggy. I feel this model now classes as classic as its over ten years old.

Well it's a small vehicle, very simplistic in design, but because of this it captures the ideals of a beach cruiser. The handle bars remind me of a quad bike while the back reminds me buggy so it's kind of a cross between the two. Complete with lights, spotties, megaphone, radio and flag it has everything you want in a beach buggy. The tires and tow anchor at the front also add to the things this model requires.

The mini-fig is also very appropriate with  brightly coloured pants and hat, with a cool vest to match. The colour scheme of the vehicle itself is also very good as it would stand out well on a beach. The best part of this model is the front panel is not a sticker, its printed on.

No real faults with this little gut so overall he's getting a 7/10 and i feel he is a must for any beach fan or city collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There is a Lego Naval Academy (or whatever it is) logo printed on a 2x2 studless plate. The minifig has a nice torso and comes with rare swimming trunk legs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I always thought that he shud have had a life jacket. But the other acsesories where always good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction only has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some cool pieces which are always great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. We get lot's of red and white pieces and a printed tile as well.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig we get with this set looks really cool. He has a gray uniform, a blue cap, black shades and black swimming trunks.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6518-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The design of this little model looks great - even if this set doesn't have any play features. This vehicle is very nice and easy to maneuver and is very sturdy as well. This set has also been part of the very first LEGO Island videogame which came out a while back.<br></span></p>

"fatalleader","2011-06-22T14:06:33.67Z","My first one","This set holds memories for me, some good, some bad, and some that are just plain annoying. The good is this was my first ever Lego set. The bad is that my dad gave it to me back in like '96 or '97 or so, when I was just in preschool, when he and my mom got divorced. The just plain annoying is I lost the instructions and, until now, couldn't remember how to build it.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,4
"barbarossa82","2016-01-18T18:07:51.667Z","Better than average for its time and type","<p>It took me an embarrassingly long time to realise that the quad bike rider&#39;s yellow legs with their black separators were supposed to represent naked legs and a pair of speedos. Speedos, a fleece and shades: now that&#39;s a classy look! It also bugged me that he didn&#39;t have the printed Coast Guard decal on his cap.</p>

<p>Leaving aside his questionable dress sense, the set is really superior to the sum of its parts. It has a rugged, solid feel despite the relatively few parts involved, and really looks and handles like a powerful little vehicle for the rider to reach where he&#39;s needed. I love the little handlebar piece, which is a rarity, and the transverse clips used to attach the searchlights to the rear rollbar. The flag just makes it a bit more playful and fits in better with the theme of the second-generation coastguards, who were always a bit more showy than their predecessors!</p>

<p>The other positive factor about this set is that does something different to the three vehicles&nbsp;supplied with the coast guard base. Often the smaller sets in a sub-theme were just reduced, less functional versions of the &quot;flagship&quot; vehicles; but this brings something unique and valuable to the line-up.</p>
