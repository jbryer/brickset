When you slam down on their head, the puck only goes a couple of cm and starts rolling, unlike what they promised. The rink is weak and takes up too much room. I customized the players so now the puck CAN fly across the rink, the entire table even. The spring mechanism is very weak, so needless to say, I chucked it. Overall, terrible set. I don't see what the big deal is. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

However, it's rather hard to play with, since the ball often stops before it gets to the next player, and it's hard to really move them and play at the same time. Not to mention the pure size of the rink makes storing it quite difficult. It also doesn't stay together that well.

Despite my complaints, it is fun to play with, if you can figure out a way to without getting frusterated.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
