<p>As a preface: the world of Mythica, as defined by the park attraction, is a world powered by imagination, where every fantasy creature children have ever built out of Lego becomes a life-size, living, breathing animal. The centrepiece of this land, in the park, is the Flight of the Sky Lion, billed as the UK&#39;s first ever flying theatre ride, where Maximus the Sky Lion carries park visitors deep into the land of Mythica in an immersive gondola ride.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, then, Maximus is the focus and the highlight of this set. While (understandably!) smaller than his representation in the park, and perhaps a little smaller than might be expected, the magnificent feline is an impressively sturdy build that makes the most of the set&#39;s 500-or-so parts. Bags 3 through 6 of the set contain his torso, legs, head and tail, and wings, respectively.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I haven&#39;t bought a new Lego set in a hot minute, so I&#39;m not up-to-date on current building techniques, but I don&#39;t think there were any especially uncommon techniques on display here; however the build is still incredibly effective even if not overly complex, and was a fun experience to assemble. (In my case, I shared the building experience with my girlfriend, as something we could do together.)</p>

<p>Brackets and curved slopes are put to good use to form the animal&#39;s smooth sides, giving him a torso of surprising heft and sturdiness for its size. Maximus&#39; limbs are more slender, being only one stud wide in most places, but nonetheless support his body effectively and are attached by small ball joints that give him a decent range of poseability. He has no ability to bend his legs, but his sturdy paws are attached with clips and so can also aid in posing. His tail, also comprised of ball joints, is nothing especial to write home about, but it does the job.</p>

<p>And the head is where he starts to get particularly impressive. Seeing it grow from a collection of plates and brackets, mounted on a Bionicle-style ball joint, to a recognisable shape is a supremely satisfying part of the build. His mane has good volume, and its fluffiness is well represented by several of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-27261"">rock piece design 27261</a>, a part that I personally hadn&#39;t encountered before now, although it is by no means new. His features seem appropriately regal for a lion, and I&#39;m impressed by the shaping achieved around them with various small sloped pieces. His jaw is hinged by clips on a 3-length bar, and while his mouth can&#39;t quite fully close, the satisfaction of the moving part makes it worthwhile and doesn&#39;t stop him from looking good. The addition of a couple of front teeth to cover the gap might have made the jaw even more effective, but that&#39;s a minor detail; and he&#39;s not lacking for teeth on the sides with <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-15208"">part 15208</a>.</p>

<p>The things that really give Maximus his distinctive appearance, however, are of course his wings. Constructed mostly out of plates and bows, with two major segments joined by click-hinges and four individual feathers at the tips attached by clips, they give him a satisfying range of poseability and come together most effectively; and adding them immediately completes his visage, giving the Sky Lion his distinctive majesty.</p>

<p>The ancillary builds of bag one and two consist of BitsandBobs - Mythica&#39;s other mascot besides Maximus, a tiny winged unicorn who appears in his more lifelike form in the safety video for the Sky Lion ride -; a pair of snapping flytrap plants; the gateway into Mythica, based on a similar structure in the park itself; and two young explorers (park visitors) who are taking the journey into the fantasy world. Bobs, it has been pointed out by members more observant than me, is mostly a recolour of the unicorn from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10401-1"">#10401 Rainbow Fun</a>; his build is simple and a bit silly, but is a decent match for the character.</p>

<p>The snapping flytraps are also not complex, but no less effective for it; making use of small ball joints for the stems and jaws built around clips which allow them to open and shut - the one minor frustration with them is the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-31576"">part 31576</a> which is attached before the heads and easily jarred loose when the joints are snapped into place.</p>

<p>The Mythica gate makes ingenious use of click hinges and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-35341"">tiles-with-points</a> to capture an effective curve. Of course, this is the part of the build that includes the bane of many an AFOL&#39;s experience - stickers! However, they aren&#39;t many; I found them easy to apply with no trouble, and they have surprisingly good colour-matching and so don&#39;t stand out overmuch.</p>

<p>The minifigures... there&#39;s nothing much to say about them, they&#39;re a couple of kids visiting the park, a boy equipped with a magnifying glass and a girl with a camera. They&#39;re both suitably cute, though; and while it may not be the set&#39;s intention, there are enough exposed studs for them both to stand on Maximus&#39; back for a ride.</p>

<p>Do I have anything negative to say about the set at all? I have to say, not really. The only real issue I see with it is that, when Maximus&#39; head is raised, it reveals an awkward gap in his mane, through which the end of a couple of pieces of his colourful internal construction can be seen - a yellow brick and a pink plate. At the same time, however, I understand the necessity of this; setting the ball socket any further back into his neck would have removed any possibility of head articulation at all, and poseability is definitely the more important consideration. Too, those coloured pieces can only be seen from certain angles; still, making them a shade of blue like the mane would have made them stand out less.</p>

<p>Still, though. To me, that is only a minor quibble; I would still give the set a solid 9/10 for the sturdiness and majesty of the Sky Lion, enjoyable building experience, and the fun selection of surrounding builds. To anyone who has been on the ride and would love to take a piece of it home with them, I would absolutely recommend this set; the price of &pound;45 doesn&#39;t seem excessive to me, given that the set has souvenir value as well as being a fun model.</p>

<p>A word of advice, though: if you&#39;re planning to buy it as part of a Legoland Windsor visit, you may be wise to buy it early in the day; on our trip, it was in stock in the Heartlake City Mall at lunchtime but completely sold out in all shops by the time the park closed.</p>
