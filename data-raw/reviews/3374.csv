"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-16T21:41:59Z","Cool","This is a cool set and I like the fact the driver comes with the cap and helmet. He has flames in cones to dodge as you race him and it is fun to play with. The only downside is the black bit connecting the front to the back keeps on coming unstuck, usally on the front. 
Overall it is a one of the best racing sets and it is fun to play with. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-15T02:41:40.89Z","Little bit bigger scale than most race cars","The roll cage does often come off the front of the car, the minifigure man is a handsome dude. Like the flames coming out of the back of the engine. Cones are also provided to weave in and out. Overall a solid 4, low price, decent playability.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The roll cage is nice and with extra pieces this set can be changed to anyones personal preferance. The racers helmet looks strange but the overall design looks and is awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction only has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has lot's of useful pieces which are always great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig looks really cool. I really like his overalls with the tiger on it. The face of the driver is very cool as well. I also like the black helmet which the minifig has.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get 2 stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6519-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't have a lot of play features but it's still easy to maneuver. The only feature we get with this set is that the black engines sviwel. We also get 3 cones with a flame on the top. As I told you in the beginning: </span>This is a fun little set to have.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
