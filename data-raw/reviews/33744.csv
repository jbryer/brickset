"calzonie","2022-12-12T08:03:40.95Z","Cute Little Train!","<p>The Winter Holiday Train is a perfect little build for its size and just feels nice to look at, which I think is all you can ask from something like this. The locomotive has a great color scheme and as much detail as you could possibly fit at this scale. The other two cars are a lot less intricate, but they fit the holiday theme and their simplicity would make it easy to extend the train with custom builds. I&#39;m not sure if this was an intentional detail, but I like how the green car has enough storage space to fit the extra parts when you&#39;re done. I don&#39;t think this train would fit on any LEGO railroad pieces, which is the only real downside. I&#39;d like to see some mini rails eventually, to compliment this 4-wide scale.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to judge the value of a Gift With Purchase, but with a buying requirement of $40 USD, it&#39;s still on the lower end. Compared to the other current Holiday&nbsp;GWP, 40565 Santa&#39;s Workshop, the Winter Holiday Train is much more affordable and arguably a better set overall.</p>

<p>The part selection is good, could certainly help any MOC. 2x2 jumper plate in gold is probably the best part in this set.</p>

<p>The playability is minimal, the wheels spin nicely, and you can swap the carts around. You could also combine it with the locomotive from&nbsp;11021&nbsp;90 Years of Play, as they&#39;re both part of the Micro Train System.</p>

<p>The value for the money is certainly here. I think the price is fair, but I&#39;ve heard that it is only distributed as a GWP in certain regions.</p>

<p>Overall rating: 7/10</p>
