"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-24T21:36:05Z","Mobile Outpost","My opinion for 6520 Mobile Outpost is relatively fair, given that there's an acceptable amount of Arctic themed minifigs and pieces in the set.The &quot;outpost&quot; part of it is quite elegant and intriguing and charming.I think that the caterpillar treads are a clever idea. My most favorite part, however, is the little skidoo that comes with it.
I enjoy this the most, for some reason, but I think it's cool. Another 2 neat features about this set is the frozen fossil and the polar bear.I think that the fossil was an ingenius idea what with the orange spider frozen in the meteorite. The polar bear was, in my part, a great addition to this set. All in all, I give this set an &quot;8&quot; rating.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-13T17:58:26Z","Cold, Cold, Cold","It was a good beginner set for me. The mini-figures are cool. The big ice mobile is wickedly cool. The only problem with the big ice mobile is that on a real structure it can hardly move. The building is cool also.

Pros:
Big, cool, Ice Mobile
Cool place to stay(building)
Good Minifigs

Cons:
Ice Mobile can't roll.
No space in the building.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-15T02:47:55.59Z","One of my first mid-priced LEGO sets and I still love it!!","The Artic theme is great or should I say &quot;cool&quot;. I like the orange accent pieces in the set. The lab is very detailed and I love the way it folds up to be pulled(with a chain) to other locations. The snow cat is very cool with its tracks and winch on the front of the truck. Loads of special gear and storage boxes. This set is a blast to play with especially if you have a few other Artic sets. I rate this set a strong 5 maybe 5.5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-07T20:34:20.107Z","Best Arctic Set by Far","This set is probably the best of the Arctic theme because it is fun to play with and has alot of great features. I like the truck with the tank treads because it's nicely detailed. The trailer shed isn't bad either. Overall, this set is fantastic and is an excellent set to get.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-10T05:54:19.3Z","LEGO Town (Arctic) - Mobile Outpost Review","<p>This is a good set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 218 pieces and it was 30 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio is 14 cents per piece. It may be a little bit high but it's still worth getting it. The bags where you get the pieces in are numbered, too.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two very nice minifigs which come with this set: One of the explorers has a green suit with a green hood and a gray backpack. The other one has a black suit with blue arms and blue legs. He also has a black hood. Both figures also have goggles on their face which gives them a very nice look, too.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers with this set. Even if I don't like stickers I've to say that they bring a set to life.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6520-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The completed model looks amazing! We get a very cool polar bear, a snowmobile and a truck with a trailer. The snowmobile has a very nice look and the front where you can see the LEGO Town (Arctic) logo is printed which makes this set more valuable. On the front we can also see some headlights and on the back we can also see some accessories. The truck itself has a cable on the front which you can pull in and/or out very nice and easy and I also love the design of the cockpit and the way how you open the cockpit although I wish that there could have been a lot more going on in the cockpit, too. On the back we can see two boxes with some equipment for the explorers and a place where you can put the chain for the trailer which is supposed to be the base.</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The base has a very nice design, too. The radar on the top of the base sviwels full 360Â° and you can also adjust it. The chain is able to close the trailer and if you take it off you can have a look in the inside. In the inside we can see a place for the backpacks and a screen which looks very nice. I also like the big pieces where you can put the windows in. I really can't complain much about this model.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
