<br />
The minifig of Sally is pretty good even with &#39;bare&#39; arms. The spacesuit she wears looks really good in the orange and blue. I like the new-for-2022 &#39;armour&#39; piece (6390121) and I think it meshes relatively well with the printing and colour scheme. The assembly on the back to give lights is okay, but makes the minifigure very back-heavy and prone to falling over. There is no hair included for this minifigure, which I feel is a bit of a shame given how she is depicted without her helmet within the magazine, but this is a minor issue.<br />
<br />
The Satellite is an okay inclusion, and it looks the part. It doesn&#39;t use any interesting or unique techniques, but it looks as you would expect. My criticisms with it lie in that it has no play features nor can you pose it or even do much with it. I am sure a child using their imagination could do things with it, but I feel that perhaps a few accessories or a small build Sally could use would fit the set better.<br />
<br />
Overall I think this set is a nice addition to anyone&#39;s City or modern Space collection, but the satellite will likely be used for parts rather than displayed.</p>
