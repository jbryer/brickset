"M_Tron_Hero_Kodiak","2010-06-12T23:14:46.047Z","Great Little Set.  Every town should have one.","<p>I recieved this set when I was old enough to have legos.&nbsp; I was six at the time.&nbsp; My parents got it for me for my birthday.&nbsp; I played that little repair truck untill the wheels and printed on decals came off!!&nbsp; I have everything but the Wrench symbol brick on top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an excellent set.</p>
<p>I gave an 4 for overall rating.</p>
<p>The Building experience is 4, because at that age I was able to complete it myself, but when the bigger sets came, not so much on my own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For parts, gave it&nbsp;a 2.&nbsp; In the 80's, they have some neat parts but this set&nbsp;was pretty basic.&nbsp; Plus it can not really compete with sets of today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability is high, as the tools are easily put in place and removed.&nbsp; The minifig can also get in and out&nbsp;easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good set.</p>",TRUE,4,2,4,5,4
"Lego12vFan","2010-07-10T14:32:44.7Z","Beautiful little set!","This is one of the simple yet timeless sets from the 80's, with its minimal, understated, functional design and attention to detail. It comes with beautifully screen-printed bricks, as well as little details such as hand tools, roof-mounted antenna and emergency warning lights. The use of two little 1 x 1 translucent red bricks which make the real lights is yet another example of great design: Simple and clever! The 4 x 10 chassis with a 2 x 2 cavity in the center, where the driver takes his seat, is another very well-thought design feature.&nbsp;The rooftop hinges for the driver to slide in to his seat.&nbsp;The overall scale and proportion, along with its clean, sleek lines and eye-catching color make this vehicle beautiful to look at. And finally, the driver with the screen-printed graphics in white on the blue upper body and gray pants and red cap, standing next to the yellow vehicle is pretty attractive.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

"AETerry","2011-01-16T11:19:21.333Z","Emergency Repair Truck Review","<p>Much as I love this set, everytime I look at it, there's always feelings of guilty pleasure derived from how I got this set. A cousin of mine in youth engaged in some shoplifting... so by the time they were discovered, the sets had been opened and played with, pieces missing, the store couldn't accept them back... least told the relative who brought them, to keep them. Being a child at the time, that's the story I remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple years later, the relative gave me the Legos as they couldn't give them to the cousin, it'd only reward bad behavior and they knew I was the other lego fan in the family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good classic set, I've just never gotten to enjoy it to it's fullest potential due to pieces being missing when I got it. As an adult now, I'd go for a reassembling it and finding out what's missing to complete it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5

"Zac","2021-12-02T11:14:11.34Z","Perplexing set from an excellent sub-theme","<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The maintenance sub-theme of Town includes some of the most interesting vehicles of the 1980s and early &rsquo;90s because of their varied purposes. 6521 Emergency Repair Truck is one of the smaller models, and was designed by Torben Plagborg for the 1987 line. It lacks the still-impressive functions of the more specialized 6671 Utility Repair Lift and 6668 Recycle Truck but nonetheless offers a welcome respite from the usual Town subjects. More puzzling are its contradictions: it&rsquo;s not quite a consumer or utility vehicle, and it&rsquo;s unclear if it assists minifigure motorists or maintains the roads along which they drive.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Design.</b> Unlike most comparable maintenance vehicles of its era, 6521 has a one-piece 4x8 chassis, rather than a brick-built one, which forces it into a pattern more typical of consumer vehicles. Notice the flat, broad hood, the unusually low-slung seat, and the placement of the seat in the middle rather than towards the front. The rear storage area, which can carry tools, signs, and so on, is much higher than the seat, which looks strange from the side.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The rear also appears truncated: this is been obscured in the official image by positioning the minifigure at the rear. To my mind the problem results from the use of 2x2 panels. Had Plagborg used only the 2x4 piece designed to support a hinged roof, as in 6656 Tow Truck, the proportions would have been improved by a smaller cab and larger rear. Alternatively, had he added the same 2x4 to the existing 2x2 pieces the back part of the cab would appear more substantial, as in 6671 Utility Repair Lift. Either would have produced a more coherent model. The light and sign complex on top of the roof, however, has been realized very successfully.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Pieces.</b> The bricks that make up my model lack clutch power to the degree of limiting the set&rsquo;s functionality. I purchased mine used and don&rsquo;t own many pre-1990 sets so can&rsquo;t say if this is an aging problem, but the 1x1 plates detach too easily from the bricks underneath them. When I try to swing open the roof it won&rsquo;t detach from the windshield. Instead, the 2x2 panels and the 1x1s beneath them detach from the chassis.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The excellent printed pieces partially compensate for these problems: the panels are unique and the wrench nearly so. Like the &ldquo;DB&rdquo; stickers on trains of this era, the road insignia on the panels was taken from the non-Lego world, specifically from the German autobahn. Incidentally, the print of a black wrench on yellow has been revived recently in mirror image in brick-built form, above the garage door of 10264 Corner Garage. An intentional homage?</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Purpose.</b> What is the blue-jacketed minifigure in 6521 meant to do? Brickset lists the name of the set as &ldquo;Emergency Repair Truck,&rdquo; which explains the sign on top of the roof and the included wrench. One could use a wrench to fix a stranded or broken-down vehicle. The 1987 and 1988 U. K. catalogues, however, list the set as &ldquo;Road Patrol,&rdquo; suggesting a general-purpose assignment: clearing debris, performing minor road maintenance, helping motorists to a limited degree. For this the hammer might plausibly be useful, and it would explain the autobahn insignia on the 2x2 panels. The set&rsquo;s function consequently remains vague.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">6521 is an enjoyable if imperfect model that suffers from some confusion about its purpose. Three stars.</span></span></span></p>
