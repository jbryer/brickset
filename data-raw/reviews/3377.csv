"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-11T09:50:16.64Z","Perfect little set","This small set ticks all the right boxes: two classic motorbikes which, despite being small enough to be in scale to the minifigs, offer a lot of customization options; wonderful police officer minifigs in detailed uniforms that blend a &quot;biker&quot; look with a police badge; and to round it off, a lovely archaic police phone booth. While it doesn't have many parts, it's perfect in it's simplicity.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rick76","2009-06-28T20:28:14.92Z","beautiful set..","i remember that i wanted to expand my police force and this set was just great for that purpose. I spent all afternoon waiting for my father to come back from the office (around 5 pm) to take me to the toystore to buy it with money i have saved from my birthday.. I bought this set and 2 T-road plates to expand my city.. 
I am glad that my dad took me even if he might have been tired after a workday.   This set was the back bone of my police force until i get a proper police station... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana"">Why they need their very exclusive own telephone when CB radios operate perfectly for any competent MF serviceman, is beyond most taxpaying MFs. Frustratingly for the bike cops, they've no doubt got to home in regularly on this booth just to call in and let chiefy know that they are on the case and not snacking down at the local cafe. Historically police telephones have existed and maybe this is for the MF public to call in emergencies?</p>

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana"">Those inferior points to the public telephone box 6613 are the lack of bricks, a less interesting build and less broadly recognisable as a town feature. Contradicting this though, I actually rate this set highly. Its original, unusual and contains the classic bike pair to add some high speed law power to your force. The phone is just a bizarre but attractive centrepiece- no amazing build there but a preferably interesting set for the last of the pre-visor police helmet and better than that badly coloured, god-awful high tech nonsense later on.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana"">The phone brick is a smashing print and the booth has great panel bricks in cool bluey glass. Bit of a vandal magnet, I'm afraid. The bikes are really favourable here in clean, bright white and the aerial placed behind the rider to expose the blue light. Police plates as usual and not at all bad even without the excellent but frail windshield.</p>

"AETerry","2011-02-08T20:03:38.037Z","Highway Patrol Review","<p>While there isn't much in the way of actual build and is fairly simple, this set adds and expands on any Police Force a Lego Town or City might have. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two minifigure police on two old-style motorcycles with an old style police call box. A call box like that must be something that was found over in the UK and other countries in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still it's a fun set, getting two motorcycles to patrol a Lego Town is rather fun for keeping the peace.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,5
"omnius","2019-03-25T01:35:34.467Z","A good classic Police 'troop-builder'","<p>Dating from 1987, this small set features a police phone and two officers on motorbikes. This set is noteworthy for being one of the last to use the pre-visor helmets, and is a cheap source of minifigure&nbsp;motorbikes!</p>

<p>The build is fairly simple - assembling the bikes involves adding two 1 x 2 &#39;Police&#39; tiles, front &amp; rear lights, a blue light and an antenna, while the phone consists of just eight parts. Nonetheless, printed tiles, a brick and a slope give the set plenty of detail.</p>

<p>Once built, the set is very playable - the motorbikes can stand up unaided either with or without a rider, and the phone adds detail to any street scene. It&#39;s also a great set to get multiples of, should you need more motorbike cops!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a collector of classic Town sets, this is a great purchase - don&#39;t be put off by the relatively simple build, the end result is more than worth it.</p>
