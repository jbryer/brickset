"tkatt","2022-05-20T22:27:19.783Z","Damaged upon arrival","<p>This hat could have been great. Unfortunately someone thought it would be a good idea make it &quot;retro&quot;. The retro look is achieved by damaging the front of the bill, which in my opinion looks terrible. The hat doesn&#39;t fit an adult head very well, keep this in mind if you have a larger than average head.</p>

<p>LEGO could do very well selling shirts and hats with the classic space logo, just not like this.</p>

"HoodedOne","2022-05-21T12:42:01.773Z","Perfect ","<p>These caps are getting a lot of bad comments for the &#39;fake&#39; damage on it. And yes, it&#39;s fake damage because there&#39;s still a layer of cloth beneath it. I think the look they went for is perfect for these stiles of caps. And I really like it that it doesn&#39;t scream lego, unless you know what the logo on it means. Also, some people commented on the size. But, as an AFOL I can say this is one of the best fitting caps I have used. I guess, some people don&#39;t know what the Velcro strap on the back is for. :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>This, and the octan version are great products for the retro liking lego fans.&nbsp;</p>

"nu_montag","2022-05-28T20:27:33.47Z","Regarding the size...","<p>Reviews were mixed as to whether this hat is a good fit for larger heads. I think the size is fine, but be aware that this cap is a shallower style.</p>

<p>I have an average size head, about&nbsp;22 in&nbsp;(59 cm), and the hat fits fine without adjusting the Velcro band. The band easily extends to around 25 in (64 cm), so it should be fine for larger heads. However, the cap is somewhat shallow, so you may notice it sits higher on your forehead with a slightly loose fit. I think this might be&nbsp;the source of the discrepancy in earlier&nbsp;reviews.</p>

<p>I love the color and think the faux wear on the brim looks good enough, if a touch manufactured with how clean the rest of the hat looks. I&#39;m sure it will even out&nbsp;given time and genuine wear. The patch is good quality and the light blue outline makes the logo pop without being gaudy.</p>

"leetshoe","2022-05-24T20:15:21.713Z","Terrible hat for tiny heads","<p>This hat is for people with tiny heads. If you are a small boy with a tiny head you will probably love this hat. If you are an adult with a normal size head OR a small boy with an above-average size head then you will not be able to wear this hat.</p>
