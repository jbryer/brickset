Thus, value to price ratio is infinite, so to speak. Nowadays, the set is near impossible to find with original bricks and instructions. Due to its history and rarity it is a very interesting technic set.</p>

<p>Is it also a good set? It certainly has its charmes. Basically, what you get is a small crank-driven motor with 1 square cylinder. Gear ratio is very high, so turning the crank results in very satisfying sound and movement. And that&#39;s it. Oh, and it is very red.</p>

<p>I see this as an early predecessor to 858/8858 auto engines, a set I truly love.</p>

<p>So is it worth the 25 EUR I paid for an original one with original instructions? For me as a Lego Technic history buff yes! I see this as a jewel in my collection. If you&#39;re looking for play value, better look somewhere else.</p>
