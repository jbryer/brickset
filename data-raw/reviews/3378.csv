My brother and I each got this set on Christmas of 2003, and I (being a huge Lego fan) opened & built it somewhere in the 10 minutes after i found it. 

Both products in the set (the ball and the set itself) are pretty much only fun to play with as long as someone else is playing with you. What i mean by this is if you are by yourself playing with the Lego set, it just isn't as exciting compared to competing against a friend! Getting back to the review, here is the LEGO set's pros & cons:

PROS:
Relatively easy to build
Fun to play with
New (and probably useful) pieces, like the basketball and hoops.

CONS:
Stickers...
Hard to aim 
Cannot be played with conventional minifigures
Ball is light-weight, so it will fly EVERYWHERE as soon as you launch it.
If you manage to hit the backboard, it'll probably break in two.

For predictable reasons, i liked the ball a lot better. It was/is really fun to play with & throw around. One of the reasons i liked it most though was because it was my first Lego-related product that wasn't made out of bricks (merchandise, woot).  Here are the pros and cons:

PROS:
Fun to play with
Good for a collection or to put on display
Well made
Good as a stress reliever (throw it around, wrestle it, etcetera)

CONS:
About 7 3/4 inches in diameter
Because of it's size, it doesn't bounce as high as you might want it to
Hurts when thrown at you.

Overall, if you want to add something to your general Lego collection, these two items go great next to each other in a display case. 4 out of 5.
