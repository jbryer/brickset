Nice car, and what makes it rare are the 'First Aid' Cross PRINTED on the minifig torso and the car instead of decals! Place this car alongside any new Lego trucks will make the truck looks really massive and this car really cute!

Pros: 
PRINTED Parts on minifigs and Car!
Super cute for it's size!
Value for money!
Brown rare suit case!

Cons:
Sirens dont look so good.. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

When resently i started assembling all my old Lego sets, i vaguely rembered, having somekind of ambulace or something like that, and i didn't have the manual, nor could i remember the model number or how it looked. So i searched around for ""Lego Ambulance"", and i didn't find anything i could relate to. Then i startet looking through the town sets by year, and when i stumbled on this set, oh man, that's when i felt all warn and fussy inside! There it was, the cute little set from my childhood years, the special little car, that was my first Lego Ambulan... Wait.. RED CROSS?? Oh well, it's stil very cute, even if it's not really an ambulance. :)

The model itself is built like a brick (no pond intended), it's very sturdy, and it will not fall apart, even if you accidently drop it of the table. It has high design quality and lots of detail, like the roof that opens, the widow in the backdor can be opened, and of course the little compartment in the back for the nurde/doctors suitcase. It's built on a one-pice chassis, and in itself it's not a very complicatet build. Still there's parts enough, so that it leaves room for experimentation with the design.

Really nice little set, and if this is not already part of your town's medical facility, you should wait no more! get it, get it now! :)

This set gets a top 5/5 from me.

On a side note. This is from a time when Lego pieces could be considered more or less universal. Not really any special parts, cast for just one model, and then rarely or never used again. I really wish Lego would go back to using their classic mid 70's to mid 90's designs, and parts.

Best Regards.

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-30T08:41:41.88Z","Mobile Mother Teresa","Around this time, Lego increasingly began casting Town roles, including Doctors, as females and here is such an example of such equality.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Doctor jacket print.</li></ul>With her trusty brown case, long black hair and red cross jacket torso print she looks the epitome of rescue and care, what a saviour.</div><div><br><b>Tender Loving Care</b></div><div>Red Cross is obviously a four stud vehicle set and represents a van of the mini ambulance or paramedic variety. The former suggestion is most likely with the red cross printed side panels making an enclosed space at the back. It likely stashes medicine, drugs, bandages and dressings of all sorts as well as some other first aid gear - defibrillator?&nbsp;So perhaps more like a paramedic van? Its just that as an ambulance it can never work unless a minifigure is in bits, going to the morgue (for recycling?!). This is only a problem because of MF length compared to the short van, not the usual MF fatness issues.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not an issue really and there are not real flaws in this set, in fact it os highly desirable as a Town model and also a very popular model. There are few really decent ambulances and paramedics out there. The build consists of a short four stud chassis in red. A waste really as you can not see much of this line and black usually covers description of a vehicles underside but no problem.</div><div><br></div><div>White is of course a suitable colour, perhaps the grill would have been more contrasting in grey, and forms the wheel arch bricks, hubcaps, the doors and headlight bricks, all a straight forward build. The roof is a line of red plate, those hinged car tops working well with an extra special one for the back: A sunroof becomes an excellent rear window and back door, this really should have been implemented more often, perhaps on cars too as a diagonal rear window and bodywork top section.</div><div><br></div><div>I said there were no flaws and as usual wrote too soon. There always seemed to be &nbsp;a weak design issue here with the rear lights and the one stud plates that they clip into underneath. Both these bricks literally hang from either side of the rear bumper area, not a solid build that and get they get easily knocked off during play. Generally though, most sets have a slight whinge from the likes of AFOLs and it certainly does not detract from the overall form and good points of the set such as the 'shelves' in the back, circular blue top lights and an antennae to list a few.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a completely middle of the road vehicle; a good design, character and subtheme all at a good price at the time but this will possibly score highly as a favourite for many. You may well be able to get patients sitting in the back but remember she can't transport the injured if they have to lie down. She can, no doubt, take blood, check on patients, patch them up, treat their ailments and help them die less painfully if need be.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Life &amp; Death</b></div><div>Administering last rights may not be possible as there ain't no Lego vicar/ cleric/ rabbi available yet but fear not, all good MFs no doubt go to the great brick in the sky where infinite expansive bases and large multi part piles of fresh bricks exist for them to build fine landscapes and heavenly layouts to roam in forever.</div><div><br></div><div>The bad ones? They probably get sent to pits of dusty, dented and scratched bricks, scoured of prints with flaking and warped stickers in a landscape of BURPS, large one piece sections. Here, unwanted dusty&nbsp;poor license sets,&nbsp;Belville and Bionicle demons melt them with an overheating dodgy old 12v battery box and transformer. Should probably expect some scoffing Mega Blok demon spectators too...</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

It has a storageboot in the back, with lots of extra space (Since the doc only needs room for her briefcase) to bad Lego included more tools... (like a radio). ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
