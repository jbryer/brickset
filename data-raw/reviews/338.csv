I luvitt. The only bad parts are that 1. you can't be Lewa the original. or 2. I can't get past the stupid vine part in the jungle withe the rocks by the waterfall!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T20:27:00Z","I can't win it!","Cons:

* YOu can't play as THe original Pohatu. He rools.

* I can't get past the part with the borhok that is rolling down the snowy will on level 2, when you are playing as kopaka. I think me brother can.

* A little bit expensive.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Utterly a bargain!</div><div>Overall, get this game NOW..........but avoid the Galidor multipack.</div>",FALSE,4,1,1,5,5
"mindstorms4494","2010-05-23T11:22:56.933Z","Bionicle; a Good Game Overall","I bought this game in 2008. It has 8 levels in all. The first level is about Toa Tahu helping the Matoran villagers of Ta-Koro and fighting the Rahi and Bohrok. Level 2 sees Kopaka ice surfing, trying to stop more Bohrok. Level 3 sees Gali NUVA saving Matoran villagers and fighting and defeating all 6 Bohrok-Kal at the same time. :O&nbsp; Not in a million years! Level 4 sees Pohatu riding in a cart with a Matoran, trying to open the locks to the mine cave door. Level 5 sees Onua Nuva fighting the Lerahk Rahkshi. Level 6 sees Lewa Nuva soaring through Le-Koro and fighting the Pahrak Rahkshi. Level 7 sees Tahu Nuva lava surfing trying to beat the rahkshi to Ta-Koro. Level 8..... sees Takanuva fighting and ultimately defeating Makuta once and for all! Overall, I'd say it was worth the $20.00. It inclues bonus videos unlockable by collecting light stones.",FALSE,4,2,1,4,3
