"Wipipi","2018-05-19T22:16:37.64Z","Perfect stocking stuffer!","<p>I had gotten this set last year for Christmas and I was surprised on how much of a delight it was! Let&#39;s get into the pros and cons.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>One of the only Christmas/winter themed classic town sets!</li>
	<li>Nice and cheap way to get a figure and a vehicle!</li>
	<li>Could be used outside of shoveling snow.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Nothing to use for snow! It would&#39;ve been perfect if Lego were to provide a few white 1x1 studs to plow with the snow plow!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>To conclude, this really is a great stocking stuffer. Not only is it themed for Christmas/winter, it can clear the streets of snow, leaving the Lego town folk happy and the Lego kids sad! On top of that, it can be used outside of just for the winter season, like plowing through dirt on a construction sight! I give this set an 8/10!</p>
