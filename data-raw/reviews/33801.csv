<p>First, the size of the LED light figures is not the same size as regular minifigures; they&#39;re not quite twice as tall.&nbsp; Removing the Stormtrooper helmet from this light, the minifigure measures 2.75 inches / 6.875 cm tall from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head.&nbsp; A regular minifigure without a hat/hair/helmet piece is 1-17/32 inches / 3.8 cm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, the arms, legs, and head are all moveable so you can play with the minifigure just as you would any other LEGO minifigure.&nbsp; However, they&#39;re not removable to swap with others, unless you&#39;re willing to break the light feature.&nbsp; I removed the keychain from my light figure with pliers and was glad to find that the Stormtrooper helmet was removable.&nbsp; The Stormtrooper head isn&#39;t coming off (I don&#39;t want to break it) but it is an undecorated black head to show the eyes through the helmet.&nbsp; Different figures may not allow the hair/hat/helmet to be removed.&nbsp; My Batman key light figure can have the head removed but not the cowl piece from the head.</p>

<p>Third, lights shine from LED elements inside both legs, not just one leg as most of the promotional pictures show.&nbsp; A square button on the chest is pushed to activate the lights - when you let go of the button, the lights turn off.&nbsp; The lights are fairly bright, certainly bright enough to read in the dark.&nbsp; However, I don&#39;t have a light meter or a way to gauge how bright they are.&nbsp; You wouldn&#39;t use one to wander through the woods a night though.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fourth, fun to be had!&nbsp; These literally look like the regular LEGO minifigures so it&#39;s fun to pair them up in a father/son or big brother/little brother scenario and play with them.&nbsp; If you used them as an actual keychain, you&#39;re sure to get some fun comments from friends and coworkers, while always having a minifigure around to snap a picture of in funny daily scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only downside to me is the value for money - I rated it a 3/5 because I understand it&#39;s going to cost more with the LED lights, but you can buy other flashlights related to your favourite movie or tv character for half that.&nbsp; The main draw to me is the larger size for endless play opportunities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Star Wars fan and a Stormtrooper junkie, I would highly recommend this to other Star Wars fans.&nbsp; Of course, there are plenty of there minifigures that have been converted into keychain lights for fans of other themes.&nbsp;</p>
