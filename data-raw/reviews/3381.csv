The finale and third letter I sent them all I got back was a letter,I was kind of bummed out.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T17:00:45.12Z","Leading the Charge, it's the Blaze Commander","<p>Set #6525 Blaze Commander: It is a little tricky getting all the memories straight on what I once had, especially when it comes to the Firefighter stuff in LEGO Town, I had a grand total of three Firefighters in my Mini-Figure collection before I let my cousin have the older Town stuff, and one of them is a dead ringer for the Firefighter that came with the Hook &amp; Ladder set, but I don't remember ever having a truck with a ladder on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said the more I look at Blaze Commander the more I realize, it's so familiar because it is one I had to have had. Why? Because I've still got that funky looking curved red brick among my spare pieces as well as the big white plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blaze Commander looks like it was a super fun set, but as I said I don't recall it too well. Still the set is nice, the vehicle appears to be a simple straightforward build and the Mini-Figure is a great looking Fire Chief type. The unique backpack piece and face shield/gas mask combo were always a hoot to put on the Mini-Figures, even if they weren't firefighters, because then you could enact any fantasy you wanted. I never applied the stickers that came with this set for the details, I'm not too sure why, but the piece is unmarred and doesn't have the fire sticker on it. (Which could mean it came from a different set, but I don't think so, more than likely I opened the thing took everything out and left the sticker sheet stuck to the inside of the box when I discarded it. Or it peeled off due to age.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I think this little Town set is a nice add-on to some of the classic Firefighting sets and could be a great addition to todays more modern models. It's also a great place to get pieces for MOCing, I always loved using those doors on anything I built up. If you can find it for a good price, not too expensive, then you might want to consider adding it to your Town Collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-08T10:14:41.983Z","LEGO Town (Fire) - Blaze Commander Review","<p>This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction only has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 50 pieces which are really nice to have for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure. I don't know how much it was when it was in the stores anymore but I think it's worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The firefighter has a white helmet, a black overall and a beard on his face. It's a really cool looking figure to have.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get two stickers with this set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6525-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do much but it's still very fun and easy to maneuver it. The doors can be opened and there's also a place where you can store some equipment for the firefighter. It's a good little set to add in any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
