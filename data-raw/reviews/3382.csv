"Krogh","2009-12-27T17:24:17.263Z","Fast as hell","One of the sets from my early Lego years. The biggest setback with this set is, that unless you have another dragster, there's not much playability. It's just not fun to have a dragrace, with only one dragster.

I like the design, with the exception of the front wheels. As mentioned below, it's just to flimsy. The wheels just break of way to easy during play. I just moved the wheels back a bit, and that solved the problem nicely. Other than the front wheels, the rest of the model is actually nice and sturdy. It's really flexible, just like a real dragster. As with most of the smaller lego sets, this is an easy build.

With the exception of the 6591 Nitro-Dragsters, i think that this is the best looking dragster out there.

I give the set a 4/5, the weak front wheels detract from a perfect score.
