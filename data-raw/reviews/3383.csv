Its simple, elegant and extremely playable with. The figure looks interesting but because he's not wearing traditional builders clothes like dungarees and a hard hat for example he stands out a bit more. Maybe he's the twin brother of the cyclist thats sat at the telephone booth? :) I like his tools-broom and spade, like he's tidying up things. My own copy came with a pick axe and spade-it was a copy built for me with brand newish parts-I like the pick axe instead of the broom but a tinsy purist in me wishes he had the broom.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Is it a builders truck? Is he part of a street cleaning team? The tipper is a neat feature and I like the rounded clear lights on the truck-made a change from the square lights on many a vehicle back then.</div><div><br></div><div>Having just recently bought the wonderful small 'Landscape Loader' I think this Tipper Truck goes brilliantly well with it, the size of the Loader compliments the Tipper Truck perfectly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Its a shame Lego doesn't make much Town stuff these days, as these sort of small 'ordinary' sets as opposed to endless Emergency Services stuff and licensed tat does get boring. These sorts of small sets are what <i>made</i>&nbsp;Lego. They need to go back to the drawing board and start with sets like these again.</div><div><br></div><div>I recommend this set to all AFOL's who like Classic Town stuff as I do.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,5
