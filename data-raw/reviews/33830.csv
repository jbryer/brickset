"one79","2022-07-13T15:19:30.927Z","After 42 years! The predecessor set (497) is as old as myself!","<p><strong>Disclaimer: This set review is purely my opinion even though the set is given for free by TLG due to my status as LEGO Ambassador.</strong></p>

<p>Yeeha! This is an amazing set. I always love older theme sets such as Castle, Space and Pirates. Let me tell you the feature on this set!</p>

<p>First, the size of this set is way larger than its predecessor! Besides that, body and wing of the predecessor (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/497-1/Galaxy-Explorer"">set 497</a>) is only 1 plate while this new one is very thick. Don&#39;t be fooled by the box. The box of this set is quite small, but the set that you will receive is very large compared to the set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/59168463-078e-4f12-be3a-893607481173/With+Background.jpg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The second-best thing is that this set don&#39;t use stickers and there are many printed parts on it. Some printed parts are specially made for this set, notably, the identification number of the aircraft, the golden moon logo and the status screen of the aircraft.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1657701041628-66EDCG936708W663PV4T/DSC06405.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>There is also a droid (waiter droid?) that is not available on the predecessor set. The droid and the 4 space minifigures are shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/393a4eee-7c3a-4214-8ab3-07926f4e4632/DSC06330.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>I wonder what is the function of the two long protrusions located at the front of the spaceship. Are those used for communication? Or are those actually laser cannons?&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/fb8799e0-9ad0-4993-904f-50a9a698ff16/DSC06333.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>This spaceship is two tiered. The lower part is the cockpit and the higher part is for the recuperation area along with monitoring stations.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1657688103396-TPZ3BY32S96VVUD2WFZV/DSC06262.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>One of the cool feature of this set is that this spaceship have two beds with niches that can accommodate the oxygen tanks worn by the minifigures. The minifigures can sleep with their oxygen tanks attached! From the photo below you can see the minifigure is resting, and he is smiling happily that the oxygen tank does not hinder him sleeping flat on this special bed.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/6410e2f1-6541-4572-a505-e0ceef739f88/DSC06283.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The other near feature is the three landing struts that look&nbsp;like what we see in science fiction spaceship. And the best thing is the landing struts can be folded and hidden when the spaceship take off and in flight mode.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1657690595780-EPLTDUU4H0039PM4J5KR/DSC06309.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>On the bottom of the spaceship, there are three holes used to hide the landing struts. There are two circular components that might be used to lift off the spaceship or hover midair like Harrier Jet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/3058de8e-211d-47c8-b0d4-fa64438ccb76/DSC06398.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>This spaceship is equipped with two main thrusters located on the tail fin and two secondary thrusters located on the wings. Then there are two auxiliary thrusters on both sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/2c2bf756-18dd-400d-bc93-1865317aa62f/DSC06312.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The tail fin with the main thrusters can be opened to reveal main cargo bay with rover on top of the pad. The pad can be lowered and extended, so the rover can roll out to explore the planet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/7af64fc5-b128-49ae-bb68-85c358efaf82/DSC06317.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Behind the cargo bay is the airlock that connects the cargo bay with the recuperation area. There are also two tools located in the cargo bay area which is the hand radio and wrench.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/fd1a634a-1b09-416e-938b-c2c25ffa903d/DSC06318.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>On the right side of the spaceship, there is a small storage&nbsp;that stores two different colours of handheld signalling devices. Or is it laser blasters perhaps? It will depend on how you play with your imagination for this set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/65234b81-7f34-4656-94bf-6f7991108668/DSC06303.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>On the left side of the spaceship, there is another small storage that stores a black tank. Is it a backup oxygen tank perhaps? These storages are located between the secondary thrusters and the auxiliary thrusters.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/870e0fc9-46a6-49da-9609-fe673bf19fde/DSC06305.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>I find that there are two negative points for this set. The position of the control wheel (steering) for the minifigures are not placed in the centre of the minifigures like shown in the photo below.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/8e2522c2-109e-44f1-b0fd-e0dc95092e07/DSC06271.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The second negative point is that there are no continuity for the main thrusters which are located on the tail fin of the spaceship. When we open the tail fin, there are no extension of the main thrusters. So, where are the rest of the thruster components?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1b6f4b9e-9198-4b1c-ae6c-ca933e07b591/DSC06321.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>As not to make this new Galaxy Explorer lonely, I take out three of the vintage Space sets to accompany it and welcoming it to the family as the new big brother....or is it small brother?</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>I enjoy it so much. I might not be objective enough or biased since LEGO Space is one of my favourite theme. You will feel very satisfied seeing the final result. It is big!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts are plentiful to build this set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>You can put it on display, play it by itself, play with other sets such as Star Wars, play it with your children or play it with your vintage space sets!</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much since I get this set for free. But judging from the price shown, I think the price is reasonable (cost per part). But if you can be patient enough and get it at discount, then it will be a bargain!</p>

"tmtomh","2022-08-01T23:07:23.9Z","Hard to imagine how this could be any better","<p>I can&#39;t compete with user&nbsp;one79&#39;s earlier&nbsp;review in terms of photos and detail, so I will just note some highlights:</p>

<p>- Looks just as good in person as in the photos. There appears to have been no camera trickery or cherry-picking of angles and such: it looks great in person from pretty much every angle.</p>

<p>- Its excellent swooshability is based on an even more important foundation: it&#39;s a very solid build. This is not easy with this kind of design - there are a ton of great &quot;updated Galaxy Explorer&quot; MOCs out there on Rebrickable and other sites, and in my experience they don&#39;t even come close to the build-strength and stability of this one. It&#39;s an extraordinary design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Because it&#39;s a symmetrical ship, there are some repetitive sections of the build. However, this is the most fun I&#39;ve had building a Lego set in a long time. There&#39;s a little Technic, a decent amount of SNOT, a surprising amount of conventional brick-on-brick/studs on top building, and a bunch of unusual angles and combinations of System and Technic building that&#39;s really surprising and just a joy.</p>

<p>- In normal times I would say this set is a very good value. In these times of high inflation and supply-chain issues, it&#39;s an&nbsp;<em>outrageous&nbsp;</em>value, perhaps among the best in recent years. It has 4x the parts of the original 1979 set, yet adjusted for inflation the USD price of this new set is nearly 25% less. (Yes, there&#39;s no crater baseplate and small moon base, but IMHO the ship was always the star of the show.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The functionality is excellent. The interior airlock door is surprisingly smooth and robust; the opening back doors have secure clips that hold them in place. The buggy-ramp mechanism works very well and is quite robust. The windshield hinge assemblies are super-strong (the modified tiles with finger joints stay in more securely than the similarly configured 2014 Benny&#39;s Spaceship model, for example). The little side thrusters can rotate but stay in place once set up. &nbsp;The cockpit comfortably holds all four space minifigs and they also stay surprisingly secure in the beds in the rear even though there are no stud connections. The main engines detach to become comically oversized rocket ships for the figs. And the landing gear is super-smooth and incredibly robust.</p>

<p>- It&#39;s difficult to think of any negatives with this set. The only ones that come to mind are that, as noted in the Brickset review, the steering wheels are on either end of a 6-wide space while the minifigs are seated in a 5-wide space (using jumpers), so they are not quite fully centered in front of the steering wheels. And I suppose it would&#39;ve been cool if they somehow had been able to accommodate a slightly longer or larger buggy &nbsp;that would properly seat two figs - but that would have made the back too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>IMHO this is one of the very best Lego sets of the past several years,&nbsp;of any theme or scale. I admit I am biased by my nostalgia for classic space, but this is just a first-rate set by any metric.</p>
",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"8BrickMario","2022-08-14T06:44:06.24Z","What a wonderful adventure.","<p>I was not alive during the heyday of Classic Space. I have no firsthand nostalgia for the theme. All the same, I completely&nbsp;understand the charm of the smiling spacemen in their boxy ships going out to explore the planets. I was really impressed by the tribute offerings for the 90th anniversary and since this was in my price range (side note: <em>how is this being sold for no more than $100?)</em>, it was getting rave reviews, and I had gotten back in the mood for a big LEGO set, I decided to get it.</p>

<p>Strap on your airtanks. It&#39;s gonna be a long one.</p>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>Normally, I wouldn&#39;t bother reviewing this, but it should be obvious to any buyer that this box is special. Faithfully recapturing the graphic design and background scenery of the original 1979 Galaxy Explorer&#39;s box, it leaves a distinct and very appealing visual impact. LEGO were onto something with their old boxes, and with better lighting and rendering tools, the new box displays the model perfectly with the older style. It&#39;s a great tribute and the only correct choice for the theme. The minimalist and boring black Icons (by the way, LEGO, just pick an adult-set brand name and stick with it) packaging would have done it a great disservice. The box opens with two perforated finger tabs that then fold out a flap, nicely avoiding sticky seals and allowing the box to be closed up again for display. It&#39;s one people will want to keep, that&#39;s for sure. The instructions also have great design and notes about the choosing of this model for the anniversary, and the instructions include a couple of bits of trivia about the set&nbsp;deeper in the steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been kind of away from LEGO sets for a while, so the parts feel slightly different. The translucent plastic isn&#39;t as crisp and the windscreen pieces feel somehow softer. They&#39;re not malleable, but they have a different feel than I&#39;m used to. Some of the injection molding has gotten less neat as well, but overall, the parts still function and look good. The windscreens were unwisely packaged loose with other parts, though, giving them notable scratches. If it were any less humble or old of a spacecraft, I would be pretty annoyed by that, but for the Galaxy Explorer, it&#39;s not distractingly out-of-place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The original Galaxy Explorer&#39;s crew of two red-suited and two white-suited Classic Space astronauts has returned here, using the modern Classic Space helmet introduced in Benny&#39;s Space Squad. The figures are simple, of course, and part of me would have encouraged a break from the original set by having four different colors instead of two sets of two, but the figures are charming and that&#39;s what matters. The set also features a small brick-built droid&nbsp;that directly reproduces a robot from another Classic Space set. I love it. It&#39;s also depicted serving coffee mugs, which is pretty cute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build and model</h3>

<p>Unlike the original Galaxy Explorer build, and indeed, a huge number of vehicle sets, all of the bricks here (sans the droid) go into the ship itself. There are no side models. And boy, they make that decision count.&nbsp;The ship, in video game terms, feels almost like a jump from low-poly to HD, as it&#39;s retained all of the original features with much more nuanced shaping and polish that doesn&#39;t sacrifice&nbsp;the simple charm of the original. The ship being about 50% larger allows for a lot of this increased detail, but it also gives the ship more appropriate stature and practicality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of the ship is fantastic. So much clever geometry is used to replicate the angles in a larger form&nbsp;and to add a slope to the main body of the vessel, and not a detail of the original is out of place. Some details have been upscaled in fascinating ways, like the triple-loudspeaker piece now being mimicked in larger form by being built from smaller pieces,&nbsp;and the formerly-printed white arrows now being made from blue pieces framing and snugly holding white ones. I also found myself impressed by how angled sections were locked into the model and the way the canopy hinge assembly&nbsp;was put in.&nbsp;There were several great moments of realization--<em>that&#39;s</em>&nbsp;how that comes together!</p>

<p>The original Galaxy Explorer set never seemed to be aiming for the pinnacle of sleek coolness, instead looking more humble and practical with its boxy core and wedge shape. This set replicates all of it, but the size and skilful&nbsp;modeling give it a sense of distinction. Maybe it&#39;s not the most fast or feared ship in the galaxy, but I&#39;m certain its crew revere and love it like a second home. And second home it&#39;s well-equipped to be.</p>

<p>The front cockpit of the Explorer seats all four crew members simultaneously, which is fantastic, and the steering wheels and control panels with fairly low-detail prints&nbsp;bring back the retro charm perfectly while also delivering a few cute references.</p>

<p>While the original set&#39;s second canopy tier was over the rear hold, this expanded set has two distinct canopies--and the space under the rear canopy is a whole new space in <em>front</em>&nbsp;of the hold! This space contains a rest/possibly medical bay with two futuristic&nbsp;studless beds that fit astronauts in by their airtanks slotting into a gap.&nbsp;There are also&nbsp;some more control panels. Crucially, you can fit the droid (with antennae down) into this room even while two astronauts are using the beds so it&#39;s ensured that nobody is left behind or on the exterior&nbsp;during flight.&nbsp;The exterior in this middle section&nbsp;includes two supply boxes with ambiguous stud-and-tap assemblies that could be lights or guns,&nbsp;and a set of airtanks. They may be visually implied to be a pass-through system, but the boxes only open on the outside per the shape of that very old LEGO box piece. This new room contains a sliding airlock door (great detail) leading to the hold that&nbsp;laid claim to the rear canopy in the original set.</p>

<p>Like before, the hold is equipped with a space rover to ride out the back.&nbsp;Before this can be done,&nbsp;the ship must land. The Explorer has landing gear with three&nbsp;struts that fold in and out manually.&nbsp;I love the retro character of the rounded feet and angled legs. Now landed, deploying the rover is simple. The back of the Explorer hinges in two doors&nbsp;like the old one, and an astronaut riding the rover is kept in the hold until the bottom edge of the hold is folded down and the black floor is pulled out and dropped like a ramp. Once the ramp drops, the scooter&nbsp;slips through the Technic pin &quot;gate&quot;&nbsp;and automatically rolls out of the ship onto the surface. I love the effect of&nbsp;the wheels spinning while the ramp is pulled out under it as if the astronaut is revving the scooter to roll out! It&#39;s a really slick and more visually exciting and functional reworking of the scooter ramp in the older model. The interior of the doors hold some tools, but the interior view of the assembly forming&nbsp;the arrows looks a bit unpolished.</p>

<p>The last significant play feature of the Galaxy Explorer is the engines on the wings, which, unlike on the original,&nbsp;are clipped into the grey supports and can be removed. On the underside of the engines are a seat and two levers each, allowing an astronaut to pilot them as smaller vehicles. The engines also clip in both ways, so you can have them ready to ride away with an astronaut sitting on them while they&#39;re attached to the ship.</p>

<p>I was impressed by the build, the&nbsp;reimagining, and the play features and practicality, but what made me really love this set was the sense of magic and imagination it brought back to me. I think this set works because it captures the wonder and adventure, and not just the aesthetics, of Classic Space. I found myself wanting to play with the set and make up stories for the crew like I was a kid. I found&nbsp;my Classic Space Vintage Minifigure Collection figures and the robot from the Classic Spaceman Minifigure set&nbsp;to stage with the set. I took the circular radar screen panel and replaced it with lights, using&nbsp;the tile to make my own take on&nbsp;the TeeVee <em>Hidden Side</em>&nbsp;figure in a Classic Space style. Now my ship has two robot crew members!&nbsp;I also made a small alien pet to ride with the gang using&nbsp;an eye tile and a yellow SNOT brick and antenna. I got inspired like this because&nbsp;the set just feels like fun and adventure and begs to be interacted with creatively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(And yeah, a set <em>this</em> premium-feeling for just $100 is a ridiculous steal these days.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m fully back for LEGO. But I was sure right to dip in again for this set. It&#39;s not <em>my</em> era of nostalgia, but it&#39;s still super charming, and&nbsp;it brought back my feelings of LEGO during childhood&nbsp;nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>

"Kenmore","2022-08-06T20:50:14.823Z","A 2022 LLove LLetter to LL928","<p>Wow. Well that was just joyous fun to build. As someone who had the&nbsp;1979 original when it was released I was very much looking forward to revisiting, and hopefully recapturing the excitement of building the flagship Galaxy Explorer. Could this still&nbsp;fire&nbsp;my imagination (and minifigures) into the final frontier?&nbsp;Absolutely, in fact&nbsp;this set exceeded my expectations. All of the hype, the superlatives, and positivity around this (missing crater aside) have been spot on.</p>

<p>From the packaging which evoked an earlier time to the minifigures (Hello Red!) and the backgrounds used&nbsp;in&nbsp;the instruction manual this just felt special and in keeping with a 90th anniversary set. The digital instructions for alternatives are icing on an already well appointed cake.&nbsp;I did get a second set for the mid-size build (and 2 more red Classic Spacemen!) and look forward to building it.</p>

<p>Others have given more detailed reviews of the build itself with its&nbsp;range of innovative&nbsp;techniques and use of parts.&nbsp;I will just say I really enjoyed all of those and the sense of Lego&#39;s history which flowed through the creative use of parts, the increase in size and the clever updates (in particular the airlock, landing gear and ramp)&nbsp;- and no&nbsp;stickers! Bag&nbsp;7 when I&nbsp;got to the canopies and&nbsp;the Classic Space logo on a printed&nbsp;tile&nbsp;gave me a delightful rush of childhood glee as it all really started to come together.</p>

<p>And that missing crater and landing plate?&nbsp;I am fine with that,&nbsp;there&#39;s scope to MOC them and to keep them in line with the refined aesthetic of 10497.</p>

<p>With this build LL928 is&nbsp;definitely all grown up, like many of us and this is a wonderful homage to the&nbsp;groundbreaking 1979 original. I am glad it was re-imagined and not just re-released so that it could&nbsp;truly be a love letter to Classic Space fans and to the LL928 itself. This is my set of the year (and I know it&#39;s only August) but it&#39;s a perfect blend of nostalgia, style, challenge and value for money - not to mention&nbsp;fun.&nbsp;Thanks Mike.</p>

"fanoftechnic","2022-08-05T16:35:52.553Z","The value for money is 10 out of 5 on this set","<p><strong>(A note:&nbsp;I come with particular nostalgia for this set. I wanted the original 497/928 so badly, but it was either too expensive or not available where I was. So all I could do was salivate over the photos in the catalog and build replicas with my parts. Now, 40 years later, here I am, holding something, yes, <em>even better</em>. Good things come with time.)</strong></p>

<p>That out of the way, what can I say that others have not already said? Not much. The hype is all true. Here are the things that resonated the most with me, personally:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The classic space figures</strong>. Oh man, I assembled the red one reverently and then just sat and admired it as it stood in the shipyard of loose pieces. It made me a little boy for a few minutes again. The figures don&#39;t all come in one bag, so I can look forward to picking them out one by one, over time. I don&#39;t know if LEGO did this on purpose, but oh boy!</li>
	<li><strong>The huge canopies.</strong> These are not new, new, but this is my first set with TWO of them, and they are awesome. <strong>Just, they should have been packed separately, that&#39;s all.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The building techniques used. </strong>While some of the framework&nbsp;is designed a bit oddly, I really enjoyed building it. It was not repetitive, and the techniques used are very creative, and the result is awesome.</li>
	<li><strong>Excellent play value</strong>&nbsp;with four figures, plenty of interior details and a vehicle, an airlock and a hangar bay. Some people complain about the lack of a base plate. People, that&#39;s what your bed is for.</li>
	<li><strong>The instruction manual.</strong> DON&#39;T THROW IT AWAY. It is a work of art. It has some history of LEGO space and personal notes from the designer and the ex-CEO of LEGO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>The alternate builds</strong>. IT HAS OFFICIAL ALTERNATE BUILDS! THEY ARE SO DETAILED COULD BE SOLD AS THEIR OWN SETS.</li>
	<li><strong>MOCing. </strong>Enough pieces for cool MOCing, though I could have done with some more pieces (see below).</li>

<p>Sorry for all my shouting. BUT I&#39;M SO EXCITED. Oh boy, could I go on! But these are the salient points!</p>

<p>Unless you hate classic space - and even if you do - not only is this an excellent set intrinsically, compared to the cost of other sets, I think this is exceptional value for money even for just parts. Get it! Play with it! Don&#39;t hoard it in a vault. That&#39;s what gold is for.</p>

<p>My minor, minor, negative points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We could have gotten an old style setbox&nbsp;with a flip lid and perhaps plastic bins for the pieces? That would have been heaven. I&#39;m still saving this box though just for its cool artwork!</li>
	<li>The canopies could have come in their own packs to save from scratching.</li>
	<li>I could have done with some more of the blue bricks and some blue space logo printed bricks for MOCs.</li>

"mwerle","2022-08-09T00:51:25.663Z","Great remake of the original 928","<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>So first of all, the finished product, with one flaw and one omission, is awesome! It reproduces pretty much all of the elements of the original with all of the playability features, and more.</p>

<p>The flaw is the fact you can&#39;t pick the ship up by the top; the construction method of the angled side walls is simply too weak and breaks apart if you try.</p>

<p>The omission is the lack of base-plates and the moon station. It would have been very nice to have had these as part of this set as well, but I understand they wanted to keep the price below 100USD/Euro.</p>

<p>Once finished, the set is really really nice. All four astronauts can sit in the front cockpit, with room for 3 more (4 if you remove tanks) in the lab/living quarters, and you could even have another astronaut on the buggy in the cargo bay for truly epic outings in just a single ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exterior detailing is quite nice. The underside is a bit on the plain side, with a distinct lack of landing thrusters compared to the ships from the original era, but features fully retractable landing gear! The interior detailing is just amazing. While the cockpit only includes instruments for the pilot and co-pilot, there&#39;s a fully detailed living quarters/labs with 2 beds and instrumentation stations. There&#39;s also a functional sliding airlock door to the cargo bay!</p>

<p>Apart from the already mentioned flaw, the build is quite solid and definitely swooshable - as long as you remember to always pick it up from underneath!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Now, on to the actual build...</strong></p>

<p>Following the instructions, the build was easy enough (I did stuff up one section, getting an angle wrong) if, often, quite unintuitive. There were several neat &quot;aha&quot; moments when things came together, but certainly not a build I could have come up with by myself.</p>

<p>Again, with the technic core. I understand some technic is required for the landing gear mechanism, but the rest I am definitely not a fan of. What&#39;s wrong with a brick-and-plate build for the core? Much easier to understand and re-use into MOCs.</p>

<p>The various techniques for adding the angled cladding on the outside, and the angled side-walls were also pretty neat, but again, definitely not intuitive.</p>

<p>There were also various stages where the build was &quot;hollow&quot;, with just some pieces being plastered on top to cover the gaps. In retrospect, a few of these where necessary to allow for the strange angled build styles to work, but some are just ways to save on pieces/weight.</p>

<p>The final result is mostly solid, although some gaps do show as a result of the building techniques used. Overall, not a ship to take outside and play in the dirt with as the interior spaces will fill up with sand and whatnot.</p>

<p>The choice of colours is a bit odd for a lot of the interior build. Yes, all the colours were available during the era of the original 928 (as mentioned in the manual), but most of those colours were never used in classic LEGO Space. I would have preferred them to stick with grey for the interior build. And what&#39;s with the use of various transparent pieces which are completely covered during later parts of the build? Utterly pointless.</p>

<p>The bottom and top cladding (not side) was straightforward enough, with some nice detailing on the top.&nbsp; The topside build was also mostly straightforward, save the angled side-walls, and I really like the way the cargo bay doors &quot;snap&quot; closed instead of needing the 1x2 tile as a &quot;lock&quot; as per the original. Not as much of a fan of the cockpit hinge build as it is somewhat fragile.</p>

<p>My apologies if I sound quite negative about the build, but while the build was &quot;interesting&quot;, and fun to actually build, it&#39;s not intuitive nor is it easily reusable. For LEGO, my rating definitely is in the latter categories.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/PtoU3ID"">Here is an album</a> (Imgur) of various stages of my build.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Already mentioned, but playability is great.</p>

<p>The cockpit canopies hinge up enough to allow easy access to the cockpit and the living areas of the ship, with plenty of room for quite a contingent of astronauts. The living space features two beds which the astronauts can use without removing their tanks, and there are plenty of instruments to keep everybody engaged.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fully functional airlock door between the living quarters and the cargo bay (although possibly a smidgen too small to allow an astronaut to actually go through), and the cargo bay features self-locking doors and a unique ramp for unloading the buggy. Not entirely sure it was necessary as you have to lower a ramp section before being able to use the ramp top itself, but it&#39;s nifty anyway.</p>

<p>The retracting landing gear is awesome but unfortunately it does leave some gaps in the underside for dirt to get in if you decide to take it outside.</p>

<p>The outside of the ship additionally features two smaller cargo bays for tools or samples, and interestingly the side engine pods can detach and have controls for an astronaut! The only missing thing is a lack of winglets which could snap on, so it does look a bit silly having an astronaut riding a giant engine!</p>

<p>The buggy is a bit so-so, only having room for one astronaut and not even having tool clips or a spare gas tank. Yes I get they wanted to scale the buggy up as well, but they could have added in a more substantial exploration vehicle given the room instead of just trying to scale up the original buggy.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>

<p>For what you get, I think it&#39;s a fair price. Certainly not the cheapest kit on the market, but then, neither was the original at the time.</p>

<p>Apart from the ship and the buggy there are 4 space minifigs and a couple of tools.</p>

<p>Getting the little robot butler with the cups is a nice bonus.</p>

"guachi","2023-03-07T07:51:35.497Z","Cheap plastic and poor clutch power ruin iconic set","<p>The original Galaxy Explorer is my favorite Lego set of all time. I was looking forward to building the reimagined 90th anniversary set.</p>

<p>The bags are organized nicely as you build up the frame and then flesh out that frame. It&#39;s satisfying seeing the spaceship come together.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t recommend the set. The plastic is soft and very cheap feeling. The result is the parts have very low clutch power. They don&#39;t snap together. The just squish. Every step is just squish, squish, squish. By bags 4 and 5 entire subassemblies were falling off repeatedly because the pieces wouldn&#39;t stay together.</p>

<p>While holding the set and talking with my wife about how easily the set falls apart, the set fell apart. The front left side from the guns all the way to where the angle of the wing changes collapsed in my hand. This is not a set to be played with.</p>

<p>The set is an awful build experience. I started off excited and ended up with a bitter taste in my mouth. What a disappointment.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not surprisingly, this review has been downvoted simply because it&#39;s a negative review. It&#39;s impossible to give honest negative feedback on this set.</p>

"Th3_3m3rald_M1n3cart","2023-02-09T13:29:57.043Z","The Best LEGO Set of 2022","<p>Upon initial reveal I most definitely liked 10305 Lion Knight&#39;s Castle better. But after building this, I can indeed confirm that this is the best set of 2022, and maybe the best set ever. This has the best building experience of any LEGO set ever. And that&#39;s saying something. Considering I&#39;ve built over 500 LEGO sets. I had an absolute blast building this set and truly didn&#39;t want the build to end. The whole thing is super sturdy, there are so many nice angles that come together in the frame, and so many super overcomplicated ways of making tiny details that are super fun to build.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>So due to the nature of this set, we don&#39;t have any incredibly detailed or super valuable minifigures. The minifigures in this set are the same as the original Galaxy Explorer. Two wight spacemen, and two red. They look the exact same as they did in the original, but they have higher quality plastic and sharper printing. But overall, still a fantastic minifigure selection. We also get an additional robot that wasn&#39;t included in the original set and is just a fun add-on. He has a couple of antennas, and a retro style printed 2x2 slope for his body.</p>

<p><strong>The Main Build</strong></p>

<p>This set is absolutely massive, for a non-UCS spaceship. It&#39;s almost two feet long. As I stated earlier, there are so many beautiful angles on the underside of the ship, and on the top. The sides of the cockpit/living space/lab are built sideways using technic. The interior is also simple, but nice. Feeling like 1979 but with a modern touch. Every detail in this set is printed, leading to a better build experience and some phenomenal cockpit detail. The large, yellow cockpit pieces are also very nice. But mine were scratched due to the fact that LEGO opted not to package them separately. But that&#39;s where my complaints end. The rest of the ship looks phenomenal, every part of it is super sturdy. You can pick this thing up from almost anywhere without it breaking. The engines can also detach and become smaller escape pods. The back opens up just like the original and it features a phenomenal feature to lower the rover&#39;s ramp. You pull down the bottom, then pull out a 2x16 tile piece, while the rover is held in place by two technic pins, and then the rover can drive down. The rover itself is perfectly fine and there&#39;s nothing too special to it. There&#39;s also an airlock included in the back with a sliding door and more trans-yellow pieces that looks great. So overall, an absolutely phenomenal build.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>I usually don&#39;t discuss the instructions in reviews, but I feel this is necessary. Especially in an age of really crappy instruction books. The front resembles the box nicely, and the whole thing has a retro space feel to it along with several captions with comments from the designers about the model. One says that the entire ship is made using only colors from 1979 which is incredible to think about.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this set has to be the greatest LEGO set of 2022 by far. Every angle of the ship is excellent, it&#39;s super sturdy, it has a phenomenal interior, all printed pieces, and isn&#39;t that expensive. Only coming in at $100 in the United States. But some Walmarts are selling it for $75! The PPR is good, the PPM (price per minifigure ratio) is also good for what they&#39;re doing, and the PPS (Price per stuff) ratio is also great. Overall one of the greatest LEGO sets ever made that is truly deserving of a 10/10 and the title of best LEGO set of 2022.</p>

"calzonie","2022-10-11T02:15:35.607Z","A New Gold Standard","<p>This set is, without exaggeration, one of the best things to come out of LEGO in years, especially from their 18+ lineup. LEGO has been pushing hard for the adult market over the last few years in a lot of ways;&nbsp;some of those ways are brilliant, others are&nbsp;baffling.&nbsp;But for their 90th anniversary, they decided to make a short line of sets modernizing and celebrating some iconic pieces of LEGO&nbsp;history. This was a great idea, and the few sets they&nbsp;made for it are nothing short of incredible. At $100 USD, this is by far the cheaper of the two anniversary sets (not including the bizarrely timed Forest Hideout GWP), which is really the only downside to this line. I hope they do some more of these throwback style sets with more affordable price points.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES/SIDE BUILDS</p>

<p>Moving away from the broader 90th anniversary overview and onto the set itself, I&#39;ll start with&nbsp;the minifigures. It&#39;s hard not to love some classic space astronauts, and we get a fair number of them here. There are four astronauts included, two in red and two in white. I know they did it that way to stay faithful to the original set, but it&#39;s too bad we can&#39;t get a little more color variation this time around, since the only other recent option is the already-retired Benny&#39;s Space Squad.&nbsp;These astronauts&nbsp;have the updated version of the classic space helmet mold,&nbsp;with&nbsp;a slightly thicker chin strap to avoid cracking in the middle. I&#39;m not sure why these newer helmets have an indention on top of them, though. It&#39;s a little distracting, but it doesn&#39;t ruin the figures.</p>

<p>There are two tiny side builds, both of which can fit inside the enormous Galaxy Explorer. There&#39;s an adorable little rover that fits in the back of the ship,&nbsp;and a robot that either serves drinks or really enjoys them. This robot doesn&#39;t have a great place to go like the rover does, but it fits comfortably enough the middle section. They&#39;re very simple builds, but I think that gives them a lot of charm.</p>

<p>GALAXY EXPLORER</p>

<p>Finally, it&#39;s time to talk about the main attraction here. As I&#39;ve alluded to&nbsp;before, the Galaxy Explorer is massive. It&#39;s no Titanic, but it certainly dwarfs the original. There&#39;s a good mix of studs and smooth surfaces on the top side of the model. The end result looks sleek but still leaves plenty of play space for astronauts to walk across the wingspan&nbsp;and access different parts of the ship, or even attach your own modifications if you want to.</p>

<p>In addition to retractable landing gears and some spacey thruster-like parts, the underside of the ship covers all of the inner workings with&nbsp;gray plates.&nbsp;It&#39;s such an easily overlooked part of the model, but the designer, Mike Psiaki, took the care and attention to make sure this thing&nbsp;looks great from any angle. And speaking of angles, this design pulls off some absurdly creative angles to make it look the way it does. I don&#39;t think I could describe how he does it well enough here, you&#39;d just have to build it for yourself.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m praising some design choices at random, this&nbsp;set has zero stickers. The arrows on the back section are done through some ingenious techniques, and the other fine details are done with printed pieces. I&#39;m sure that not all of the&nbsp;prints are exclusive to this set, but plenty of them are, and they all look great. I know that we shouldn&#39;t expect LEGO to always use prints over stickers, but it&#39;s so much nicer when I don&#39;t have to worry about suddenly making a set uglier with a crooked sticker. More of these &quot;premium&quot; sets targeted at adults should be willing to use prints.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Explorer features three interior sections, two of which are visible through the transparent yellow windshields. The front section is a cockpit, with just enough space to fit the whole crew. You may&nbsp;have to adjust some arms to get them side by side, but nothing too crazy. You don&#39;t even need to remove their air tanks to make them fit in the seats.The middle section is more of a living quarters for the crew. There are some computer screens and enough room for a couple of the astronauts to stand around.&nbsp;It&#39;s a little tight like the front is, but this time it&#39;s mostly due to two structures that I only just realized are supposed to be beds. I thought they were some kind of container, but turns out they&#39;re shaped that way because, once again, the astronauts can lie on them without removing their air tanks!</p>

<p>Before I get to the back section, I want to point out the engine-looking objects on either side of the middle section. Not only do they add a hefty look to power a ship as large as this, but you can remove them to have two extra flying vehicles for the astronauts to ride on!</p>

<p>The back section of the Galaxy Explorer is completely closed away.&nbsp;But by using the thrusters on the back as handles, you can open it up to store the rover. The floor of the back section is a large, black tile. I was initially confused when I added it to the build, as it didn&#39;t firmly connect to anything. It wasn&#39;t until after the build was done that I realized the tile could be pulled out and used as a ramp for the rover, reaching all the way to the ground. This sounds mundane when I describe it, but it blew my mind when I found it and it&#39;s my favorite part of the entire set. I had no idea it was there, and I&#39;ve never seen LEGO do something quite like that.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fair to say one set should be the gold standard across the board, since LEGO makes so many sets across a variety of sizes and themes with different goals. But it&#39;s genuinely difficult to think of anything the Galaxy Explorer does poorly. Even the instruction manual is cool, with little bits of designer commentary sprinkled throughout the process, explaining certain build techniques as they compare to the original 1979 model.&nbsp;I&#39;ll be surprised if we see anything hit this level of perfection and&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;again in the next few years, except possibly the other 90th anniversary set, the Lion Knights&#39; Castle.</p>

"tmdguru500","2022-08-25T01:54:32.01Z","Just an amazing set","<p>I bought this set for my son&#39;s 8th Birthday. Granted it was a bit challenging for him to build on his own, but he chose it as he loves spaceships. We did&nbsp;build&nbsp;it together and it was most definitely a fun experience. Anyways&nbsp;here are my thoughts:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. When the set it completed, it&#39;s really amazing. I really don&#39;t know how to describe it. The explorer itself, but also the different parts, such as the landing bay and the doors. The details were just amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. One thing that I liked is that the colours were not as flashy so in some ways it was easier to build and easier to the eye. The colours were the simple basic colors. The other thing is that because this set was a remake (correct me if I got the wrong word), they didn&#39;t have the stickers, but it was already in the part. I don&#39;t know, but sometimes stickers can get the better of me when building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. It does take some time to build and you do have to follow the instructions as it is laid out. The start was a tad more difficult as you build the base, but once that was done the other parts were relatively speaking straightforward and it was a fun build. Some specific and unique parts as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is based off the iconic Galaxy Explorer from 1979. It&#39;s basically the original ship except better in every way. Four spacemen and their robot fly in a ship outfitted with beds, an airlock and more. It keeps the overall shape the same while introducing the aforementioned new elements.
