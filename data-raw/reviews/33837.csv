<p>The overall build of this promo is excellent and includes some useful parts even if it isn&#39;t very easy to find. This doesn&#39;t come with any Mini figures although someone to use the grill would have been a nice inclusion to this set.</p>

<p>The instructions for the set are short as it only includes about 36&nbsp;pieces, it includes a simple feature to open and close the grill and I like the use of the printed element to resemble nobs and other controls, the use of a white 1x1 cylinder piece is a nice inclusion as a propane tank.&nbsp;<br />
The grill also sits on wheels to allow it to be moved by a mini figure.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I&#39;m giving this set an overall 5 stars and I think it would look nice in any LEGO city.</p>
