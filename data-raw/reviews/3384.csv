"Krogh","2009-12-27T16:58:17.983Z","Excellent set","This is a great little set, Small but very special in it's design. There's really not much to say about it, so this might be my shortest review yet.

Anyway, it has working suspension, a big plus, as it gives the model more freedom of movement. I remember always playing with this model any place, that had a bumpy terrain. Unfortunetly, the model itself is not very sturdy and it can fall apart easily. Not a good thing in a vehicle, that's made to be used in rugged terrain. Also, the windshield frame is a bit odd in  my opinion. Other than that, the model is really nice. not many sets like this in the wonderful world of Lego.

The minifig is excellent, a typical racing minifig, that has been used many times before, and since.

I would recommend this set to anyone that enjoys playing with their legos outside, or if your city has a place with a rugged surface, a beach, or maybe even a race track. I don't think it fits well into a normal city invironment. 

If it had been i bit more sturdy, i would have given it a top 5/5, but i don't feel that i can give it more than a 4/5. I still like the set a lot, though.

The shock absorber plates themselves are great, seriously good. I just want one model with them but unfortunately not this one in particular.</div><div><br></div><div>Nowadays without the OCD I possessed as a child builder, I can forgo the main model blueprint and try to customise and make something more individual of a set, so perhaps this can be tried with 'Sand Storm Racer' to make a more well rounded vehicle.&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with a dune buggy or hopper, great idea, but with the invention and release of the suspension bricks I would hope for a little more completed design.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><div>The choices for outfits are broad but an all white zipper driving suit could get grubby if you insist on playing in a sandpit, a corrosive experience for minifigures causing MF sand rash.</div><div><br><div><b>Sand Blaster</b></div></div><div>The build starts well enough:</div><div>a small chassis, with raised plates and wheel arches to allow the extra movement of the tyres. Hinged plates hold bar style protection that can move back and forth for entry exit the vehicle. A slanted brick sits at the thicker back section holding the twin exhaust and some coned cylindrical one stud bricks for a more showy exhaust and small engine design.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Feeling the need for somewhat sandy number two the designer got a plate print rather flatly on the front over an angled plate while the sides are kept in check by two upwardly slanting bricks. All in white, then red, then blue, repeatedly used colour schemes in the late 1980s some of us could not resist.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Schlock Absorbers</b></div><div>The real attraction though are those shock absorbers because this car otherwise just looks unfinished.

"James83","2012-07-21T06:36:13.497Z","Dune Raider","<p>This is an interesting idea, combining the suspension bricks with a weekend play vehicle. It looks good on the box but is it really durable and useful enough?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The base chassis is fairly simple but it does have a few nice elements. Overall it has a kit-built feel, you could imagine its driver building this in his shed in downtown Legotown. The lack of lights is no problem, you don't need them for offroad fun. The empty light bar at the front looks unfinished though. The front ""window"" made from a railing brick on hinges looks good and adds realism but it is very fragile and easily comes apart. The rear has a nice wheel arch furthern enhanced by sloped bricks and it allows ample vertical movement for the rear wheels. The rear engine looks a bit small but the twin exhausts with cone bricks looks very sporty. The suspesnion bricks were a great idea and its a shame more sets didn't use these beyond the few sets released in the late 1980s. The front smaller wheels give the vehicle a sporty nose-down stance. My only bugbear is that the suspesion works well on uneven hard surfaces but if you drive this over a soft surface like a duvet, or even over bricks, the suspension often doesn't move at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifgure</strong></p><p>The driver has a white racing suit and legs and has a black helmet with visor. He looks pretty smart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>The suspension was an inspired idea, you get the feeling though that they developed this set to make use of the suspension parts. A dune buggy is cool but unless your Lego down is by a beach or in a desert this doesn't make total sense. Also you can't copy this to make competitor racers unless you either buy more sets or have spare suspension parts. It looks good with the blue, red and white colour scheme and interesting windscreen, but this set&nbsp;isn't as durable as it should be for rough handling. If you buy this set then its useful but not an essential addition. If you do break this set down however, then you have two useful suspension blocks to use on other creations.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3

However, as previous reviewer noted, car is somewhat fragile and awkward in its design.&nbsp; Still enjoyable tho. <br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
