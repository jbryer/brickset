But, 30509 Yellow Yoshi&#39;s fruit tree is one of my favourite! There are more&nbsp;functions than you think . Yoshi can:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eat enemies</p>

<p>Eat fruits&nbsp;</p>

<p>React to Mario, Luigi or Peach if they jump</p>

<p>And send you a heart to earn more coins</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you can do it with fruit:</p>

<p>Roast or poison</p>

<p>Give it to Yoshi (roasted or poisoned gives too, and it looks funny!)</p>

<p>Or eat it by yourself, which gives you fire resistance for some seconds</p>

<p>Fun fact: you can take the fruit INFINITIVE times!</p>

<p>As you see, it has WAY more functions than you think. Value is fantastic for such a nice set!</p>
