Now to the review:
This set isn't that great compared to other old classic town sets. It's a bit simple and unrealistic, but it even has two minifigures, which is much for such a small set. Both are classic smiley faces, like in all town sets before 1992 The plane is an ultra light one, which I don't like so. It's very easy to build, but definately not juniorized, like all town sets before 1997.
But since it's kinda unrealistic it's only a 7/10 to me",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I was astonished to see that even Lego made a ultra light set. the design is a bit unstable but its nice. Its great that it has 2 figs. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I give to this set 4, maybe too much, but being my very first set i had some feelings for him...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was very much so on a phase of get all the Lego sets I could, this set was picked up as part of that mind-set and I think to try and fill out or attempt an air field for the other Lego Planes that I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get two minifigures, a radio control/direction on the ground and the pilot of the small Ultra Lite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know they've made planes that are Ultra Lites that are to be as minimal and light weight as possible in design yet still carry a person and fly. This set seemed to fullfill those expectations, but I've never really been sure. But as it's lego, I've always just kind of gone with it. It wasn't one of Lego's best designs.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,5
