<p>Greetings from Indonesia. Today I will be reviewing the set 40574 LEGO Brand Store which is the latest minifigure scale LEGO Brand Store set that will be released soon on early August 2022.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/d72b74b7-eb2c-4c42-b97f-bf6b5577151a/DSC00624.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The set come with two minifigures. When the side walls are in &quot;close&quot; position, we can see that the store does not look that big. But we can already see that the colour combination is a lot better than set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40145-1/LEGO-Brand-Retail-Store"">40145</a> which is kind of bland.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/03bed07b-cd20-43e2-9ae4-fc097fd0634e/LEGO+40574+minifigure?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>There are two minifigures that come with this set. A mother with &quot;probably&quot; his son. The mother is bringing her son to buy a LEGO set. Or perhaps they want to find a present for their father, perhaps? The motor has a nice patterned torso that match with the legs. The son torso is a t-shirt with a pattern and layered with a dark green jacket.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/c43473a0-9638-4df1-9ce1-014f416d67ff/DSC00620.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The torsos at the back for both minifigures are quite plain. The mother has an alternate expressions while the son does not. So we can see that both of the mother expressions are happy face!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/cccc3e69-5fad-494b-a0c3-d186e6f7f659/DSC00652.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see that this latest LEGO Brand Store follows the new design and concept for LEGO Brand Stores which more decoration inside the stores and more illustrations all over the store. We can see there is a mosaic of LEGO parts on the exterior wall of the second floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/8a7cd38b-53df-437d-9180-3bcc17880cff/DSC00655.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The second floor of this building is only one half the size of the first floor. It has its back widely open. This is disappointing for LEGO diorama builder. It is made this way, so children will easily have access to the interior of the set to play.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/9e2c396e-d6d8-42d8-9d17-c88b029fef91/DSC00642.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From this point of view on the second floor, we can see various of Ninjago, City and Duplo sets using the new stickers are on display as sets being sold. These stickers are way superior compared to the stickers from 40145 or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40305-1/LEGO-Brand-Retail-Store"">40305</a> sets.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/ffd1f38f-0e88-46e5-af33-5e74d8653c17/DSC00643.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From this point of view, we can see the new feature on LEGO Store (currently only available on few select stores) which is the Minifigure Factory. The Minifigure Factory is not the same with Build a Minifigure. Minifigure Factory has extra benefits which you can print your own custom logo and initial on the torso. You can also print letters on one piece of brick that will accompany that custom minifigure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/55633114-7b28-4b91-a1c2-684ef07de57b/DSC00659.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see there is an old model of locomotive and a castle displays on the second floor. The castle might represent the Disney Castle. On the first floor, there is a pick a brick, a giraffe illustration (or statue) and a tiger illustration (or statue). There is also a microfigure encased in a Trans clear glass cone-shaped parts which I think represent maxifigure in real life.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/b188dab5-a65a-4213-b7c3-e7a3001a2cea/LEGO+Band+Store+set?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>When both the side walls of this LEGO Brand Store sets are moved to the front, it made the building looks larger. For diorama builders, you might want to build additional walls on the sides and the back. Or the other solution is to put this building between existing building in your LEGO City, so you do not have to create the walls on the sides.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/eac9f66b-395a-4108-8a88-89466275b506/DSC00657.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>We can see the look of the interior from the behind with the rear walls moved to the front side. There is a ladder for accessing the second floor. It looks unsafe to use. I guess the designer does not have enough space to place proper stairs. It will also increase the part counts significantly.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/7d5e05c0-be83-4452-9996-85e9f3334555/DSC00637.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>We can see the interior of the middle part of first floor. There are large illustration that depict various professions for minifigures. There is also a stand in front of the illustration. I assume it to be the AR (Augmented Reality) booth that customers can use.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/94459a45-7956-4bd0-93f1-930a7d0b77b0/DSC00635.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Another angle for the first floor. We can see various Technic, Ideas, Creator 3 in 1 and Friends sets using the latest sticker sheet. There is also the trademark of large red brick that usually displayed on LEGO Brand Stores placed near the entrance.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/38187716-1817-4840-af24-3cdfbb64dfb1/DSC06641.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Alright, let us compare the minifigure-scale LEGO Brand Store. From left to right: 40145 (released in 2015), 40305 (released in 2018) and 40574 (released in 2022). 40145 is a fully enclosed set which I call mini modular. Set 40305 is fully exposed at the back but still with a roof. 40574 has been explained in this article above.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/37303ef4-0522-4af6-a2f1-9cfcac8beb46/DSC06642.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>From the photo above, we can see the back side of the three sets when they are in &quot;normal&quot; position. Only set 40305 in the middle does not have any type of hinged wall. But the position of the windows, door and ATM are interchangeable.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/2e713e43-4b05-4485-b95a-a6f07929760f/DSC06649.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Here, we can see the set 40145 fully opened. It does not look that good this way since the section that is moved to the front only looks like a long plain wall. Set 40305 stay the same. Set 40574 looks the best with the back walls moved forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/77f6e88f-0cce-4ed2-99f8-1d8fc2b104ad/DSC06643.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>Back view of the three LEGO Brand Store sets when fully opened. Overall, the set 40574 looks far better than the set 40305 because of the new sticker sheet and using the latest concept from existing real LEGO Brand Store. If only this set were made into fully enclosed modular set like 40145, it would be perfect!</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Building LEGO set is fun. If you are building a LEGO Brand Store set look-alike, the fun value is increased!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Not enough parts! It should be more to have this LEGO Brand Store to become mini modular and fully enclosed.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>A lot of play value for children or AFOL that play with their diorama or setting up special scene in their diorama. LEGO Photographers will also like this set for photo shot.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well I get this set for free. But judging on the price per part, it is reasonably priced. I will wait until there is a price reduction or discount to get a couple of the sets&nbsp;to build a larger and modular LEGO Brand Store.</p>
