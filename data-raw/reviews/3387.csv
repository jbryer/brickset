"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-24T15:06:31.717Z","Decent Package","I heard of this boxed package a while before the larger 2003 sets came out, so I was like &quot;Sure, why not pick it up?&quot;. After purchase, my reaction is that it is a pretty decent package. 

The package itself contains the Mask of Light, and two Matoran. The choices are Hahli and Hewkii, Taipu and Macky, or Kopeke and Matoro. I picked up the Hahli and Hewkii combo, for no real reason. Just because. 

Now the Matoran are nice (and you can see reviews for them in their respective areas in due time), but the real prize in this is the Mask of Light. What I bought it for. 

When I first picked up the mask, I was awed by the + rod connection, because this is the first time it had been used. It works well, but I still prefer the original stud on the mask technique to hold it in place. 

So if you want a $7.99 way to get the Mask, or you just want the matoran, or you want the whole kit-and-caboodle, this isn't a bad way to go. Decently priced, and comes with some good stuff. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-27T21:19:26.577Z","Good Deal","I got this on Bricklink (Hewkii for Joe on Christmas, Hahli and golden Avohkii for me [see my review on Hahli]).  It's great, with the rare Kanohi Avohkii and the two Matoran, Hewkii and Hahli.  Need I say more?

Pros for Hahli:

-Kohlii stick and puck

-VERY dark blue pieces

-Playability

-Swings arms

Cons for Hahli:

-Can't move head independently from arms

Pros for Hewkii:

-Kohlii stick and puck

-More tan version of Kanohi Kakama (Pohatu's mask)

-Swings arms, etc.

Cons for Hewkii:

-Same as Hahli's con

Pros for Golden Avohkii:

-RARE and HARD TO FIND

-Sentimental

-Good conversation piece and collector's item

-Has an axle connector piece, so it can fit on any Bionicle head

Cons for Golden Avohkii:

-None!

So, once and for all, this is a good set (if you can find it...).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
