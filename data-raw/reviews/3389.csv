"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-13T13:58:47Z","rebuild it a couple of years ago","I cant't remember when I got this set exactly but for a 1990 town set it's very hightech with the all glass cap that opens I've previously only seen in space sets. When I got back into Lego a couple of years back it started with a simple street with a train station, shops and a couple of cars one of them was this nice sports/busnisess car. I don't mind it came with a woman. The only negative about it is the suitcase that tends to go all over the car insides. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vagabondma","2005-06-18T17:14:14Z","A vast improvement on the cars of the time","Most cars of the time were very similar to the three that came with 6394- small and boxy.  This was the first car which actually had a modern style to it.  Unfortunately it only appeared once more in set 6625. The unique styling really helped set this car apart from the rest of the town sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

i attached a few antennas &amp; a small satellite dish to the roof and instantly had an tv news broadcasting car for my lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-16T16:09:11Z","Meet The Jetsons?","<p>Well its 1990 and along with all the wonderful Town sets on release came this strange beast. A sleek yellow go-mobile that looks like a Japanese electric prototype... from the future! I must have had too much pocket money or could not wait to save for a larger set. In my opinion this rather futuristic town transport has come straight from Back To The Future Part II of around the same time but I can see why you would like it as a kid.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;[&middot;&middot;]</b><b>[</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;]</b><b>[</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;]</b><br />
Black hair? Black suitcase? So chic... but&nbsp;with 1990&#39;s white trousers, erk!<br />
<br />
<b>Futuron Calling</b><br />
The build is much like many four stud long car constructs at first. The hub caps match the banana yellow nicely body of course and the car has little to differentiate from the ground up. Until that is you need the bonnet attached. Gasp! A sloping brick, how strange but it makes a nice design, why did they not use this more often?<br />
<br />
What no doors?! Certainly anti-theft. Well ok these plates do fine and look great. So far, the back is a little thin on bricks but past the wheel arch block there is just glass, well perspex. This is safer anyway, just try smashing an MF through an MF windscreen. And so the back ends abruptly with no boot. Then fitting on to the yellow hinge is duhn, duhn, darhn! Something from Space it would seem. The blue &#39;Futuron&#39; cockpit forms the entrance to and from this pod.<br />
<br />
Thats right, this lady has some seriously high tech kit! I bet she has the old yellow space suit stashed back at the house. Maybe this vehicle hovers, goes orbital or underwater. Has anyone ever seen a &#39;Sports Coupe&#39; that looks like this without getting a visit from men in black who calmly assure them that the last two days were spent in recovery from a freak mishap, &#39;honest&#39;.<br />
<br />
Enough said, many seem to love this which is good. It just doesn&#39;t quite make it for me, too little solids and too much transparency. The front headlights are a little nondescript, though the sloped bonnet is really different and difference is always welcome in the car end of Town. Too many similar cars makes too much sameness around the landscape.<br />
<br />
<b>Back To The Future</b><br />
At first it seems a decent car and has interesting and attractive points as a Town model... in the the year 2400 maybe! Perhaps stuck in crusty 1990&#39;s England I was oblivious to the fact that Denmark and other parts of Northern Europe indulged in a brief but colourful bubble cockpit car fad. Very nice too if you like that sort of thing.&nbsp;So a popular if highly unusual car. While a good thing it would have been more suitably set in a Future Town theme.</p>

I think the reviewer who said he has a white version probably got 6625 Police version repackaged without the stickers by a seller if second hand, if not and he got it mint in box and its all white then thats a strange variation.</div><div><br></div><div>I like the car.</div>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,5

- nice design</li><li>- good minifig</li><li>- civil car</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<br>
<p>Without a doubt this car is one of the nicest civil car construction ever made and the minifig fits perfectly with her striped shirt. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4
"mrkona","2020-06-02T11:12:49.85Z","Contemporary Car Design... for 1990!","<p>Personally&nbsp;this set represents what I consider to be one of the stranger-looking sets of the period (and, dare I say it, the beginning of the slide towards the odd sets of the late &#39;90s to early &#39;00s)...</p>

<ul>
	<li>+ve:&nbsp; Despite using the vehicle base piece (part no. 4212b) that has been around since 1980, the vehicle looks very different from anything produced up to that point...</li>
	<li>-ve:&nbsp; ...but it also looks very unusual! Ungainly, and with an awkward relationship between the front and rear glasshouse, I think the contemporary look was maybe appealing&nbsp;at the time, but now it&#39;s just painful!</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall:&nbsp; Perhaps a classic example of the hybrid period between the &#39;toy&#39; sets of the past, and the realism aimed for today...?</p>

"Naylus","2020-08-29T00:10:08.427Z","Yellow Leader","<p>As a kid I always wanted this set and it took almost 20 years to make the dream come true. Back then in 1990s I believed this was either a taxi or sort of a corporate car for an employee.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong><br />
Quite simple with black hair, the minifig has white clothes with blue stripes and blue arms. This one is typical to that time, as Lego introduced this clothes both for male and female characters. Equipped with a black suitcase this driver fits perfectly into the Town theme or a larger City.</p>

<p><strong>The Car</strong><br />
As others stated, this car uses a yellow baseplate, actually slightly bigger than other cars which I have from the same Lego period like the one in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6501-1/Sport-Convertible"">6501</a> or in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6349-1/Holiday-Villa"">6349</a>. Unlike the mentioned autos, this one doesn&#39;t have doors, but the notable large glass section easily opens, reminding somehow the car designs from <em>Total Recall</em> (1990) by&nbsp;Paul Verhoeven.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability and Build</strong><br />
The car is quite simple, like most models of the time. It&#39;s possible to figure it out without an instruction, which isn&#39;t a flaw in this case, but rather a neat visual approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In catalogue of 1990 this car can be spotted on two pages near the Fire station and at the Parking Service, where it stands on a platform. This set can be a nice addition to your town and looks good with other cars or houses such as 6370.</p>
