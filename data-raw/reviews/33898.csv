<p>If you are a fan of The Office series, this set will not leave you indifferent. It is pure gold.&nbsp;Not only does it contain a lot of mini figures, it also has a very interesting price in relation to the content and all the details that the set offers.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>The construction of the set is quite enjoyable due to the amount of details from a myriad of episodes that the set comes with. In each bag, in addition to new characters, you will build recognisable corners of the office.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that the set comes with quite a few repeated elements, such as the 4 desks or a few bookshelves with books. The good thing is that you will not find them all at once but alternated between the different bags in the process, which makes it not feel so repetitive to assemble the same piece constantly. They have also introduced some differences between the desks and details of those who sit on them (the items in the drawers, amongst other things).</p>

<p>Personally, I had a great time putting it together and to date it is one of the sets I have enjoyed the most. I&#39;m also a big fan of The Office (one of my favourite TV shows).</p>

<p>It should be noted that the set comes with a lot of stickers (more than usual). But each one of them adds details from the series that make the set even more impressive. But be prepared to snag a few.</p>

<p>Thanks to the double faces of each character, it is easy to recreate multiple scenes from the series and have a set that you can change from time to time for display.</p>

<h3>The Best</h3>

<ul>
	<li>15 very well represented characters.</li>
	<li>Endless details of many episodes.</li>
	<li>Good quantity of pieces and detail for the price.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Worst</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Although the minifigures included belong to characters from the first season, there are many details that are from later seasons. For example, that the hole in the wall from Andy&#39;s punch is there, but the character is not, is a bit odd.</li>
	<li>The size is pretty decent, but with the amount of objects there are, it all looks a bit &quot;cramped&quot; at the end.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>As I said, an amazing set for any fan of The Office series. Against popular opinion, I like that they use licenses for Ideas sets. I love putting together sets that bring back memories of things I love.</p>

<p>Compared to other similar sets, like the Friends bar, this one seems to me to be a step above in quality and fun.</p>
