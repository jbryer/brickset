"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-02T13:48:10Z","Not a bad little set,","I've had this set for about as long as I can imagine. It looks plain and pretty boring, but it has normal pieces, no large pre-made pieces, and I had much fun with it when I was younger. It went very well with sets like 6593 and especially 6389. Isn't the best, but it still beats any current juniorized helicopter sets by a mile.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>It's a good helicopter design for it's day. A solid red color to mark it as a Fire Vehicle. One minifigure. Black and Yellow side hose for spraying water over a burning area. In many ways the build is very standard and doesn't do anything to rock the boat on&nbsp;a solid build, so if you're lookign for helicopters in a collection, this was one of a few or many to get a hold of.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,5
