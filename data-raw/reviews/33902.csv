<p>The base is 8x8 and the brick is 6x6 studs wide and 4 bricks tall.&nbsp; The 1949/1950 version of the bricks had a slot which is faithfully represented in this model.&nbsp; If you missed the store event, this is made up of very basic pieces so you can create your own using the instructions here on Brickset!</p>
