"hustla187","2008-08-04T21:04:12.31Z","A Good Dump","This is actually a cool set. It has a bed that can dump some cargo like trash or dirt. I think the front slightly needs work and should include a windshield and car doors. Besides that, this is a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"suckerpunch83","2009-02-24T09:30:01.077Z","A Little Small","Picked up this set for one reason mainly: because I didn't own it already. The truck itself is small, but has some unique pieces including the black hinge plate and dump box (although small). 

If the truck had a cab on the front, it would be a little more appealing. Can't go wrong with doors and a windshield. 

All in all a nice addition to any collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
