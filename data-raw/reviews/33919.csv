<p>And this particular kit is the single worse Lego project I&#39;ve ever done. If I could get a refund from Lego I would ask for it.</p>

<p>I built the single tree version and it was frustrating and un-fun. Seriously&nbsp; UN-fun.</p>

<p>To begin with the decorations aren&#39;t securely held and tend to fall off on their own, or when one of the spinning branches hits them (the top branches can rotate around the centre piece).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not a quick build and very repetitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because the tree is in two pieces, the top section of the finished tree had a slight but noticeable lean to it -- it&#39;s simply too heavy to stay straight because it&#39;s not attached to anything.</p>

<p>The whole thing is fragile. I took it down yesterday and simply pulling up on the top half resulted in more of the ornaments coming loose and it&#39;s more difficult to store two separate sections than one solid structure that was better designed. It would have been smart if Lego had made the box wide enough to accept the finished product, but it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I likely will not bother to set it up again next year.&nbsp;</p>
