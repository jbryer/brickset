"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-06T10:50:21Z","Good Pickup Truck","This car is good, but it's not as good as the modern police car #7030. The Model has got a classic minifig,but no car springs,which I don't like on Off-Roaders like this. The car is much smaller and boxier than 7030, but hey it's an old set so it doesn't matter.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-07T09:44:18Z","well...","i really don't like these police-offroad-4wds, i've never seen any in real life. they look clumsy, probably designed for kids who can't handle small wheels. the old small tyres, not used any more in the new sets, are more realistic in minifig-scale.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"lamax6","2008-01-03T21:26:06.747Z","Needs Updating","The idea is great, but the set is very basic and boring.  
The first is the black doors.  Do yourself a favor and get a couple of white doors with police written on them.  I also added a 1x1 clip on the right hand side which allows the officer to have a walkie talkie.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

An open pick-up this model is a good representation of the changing Police design and image that either signals the end of original sets for some or the start of a new generation's collection.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>White baseball cap.</li></ul>Flat caps are so 1980's. This cop goes for cool with a baseball cap. His torso remains a bit office job though with the old shirt and jacket.</div><div><br><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal; ""><b>Black &amp; White</b></span></b></div></div><div>So you are itching to get at the chunky wheels sealed in the bag and start building, where does it go from there? To be honest the same way you have built many 4 stud 4x4s at first; the white chassis holds the wheel arches raised over the larger modern wheel by the inclusion of plates/bricks over the axles. Flat double rear lights and standard head lamps follow with a preferable black door and grill set.</div><div><br></div><div>The Police sign emblazoned on the front is a smart smooth plate as per usual backed up by another. The rear includes an angled plate to help 'hold stuff' in the back. Black safety bars protect the cab frame and hinge that holds the white roof over the light blue windscreen, top this with double blue plate lights, smooth topped which was a decent change, and an antennae and you are almost done.&nbsp;Sling some alternative blue road cones topped with yellow lights and a red triangle traffic sign in the back and the cop is ready to go to work on the town roads.</div><div><br></div><div>What makes a distinctive preference in this design is the use of black where some other Police vehicles became too white, leaving them more open as an ambulance or coast guard despite a small Police sign. The use of this black breaks up the graphics and marks it out much more as Police.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Response Rover</b></div><div>A really nice rover that accompanies many, perhaps all, other Police sets out there. A different kind of officer and model for your collection though nowadays maybe the 4x4 cops and emergency services in general have been overcooked? At least there is broad variety for each collector's personal tastes.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3
