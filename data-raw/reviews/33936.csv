"8BrickMario","2022-09-14T00:11:06.437Z","Cute, classic, but limited.","<p>After many decades of horrible minifigure-scale snowmen constructed of dubious brick assemblies and never with a proper face (including one with a&nbsp;<em>skull!</em>), I was extremely happy to see a long-overdue Snowman CMF, particularly after the Gingerbread Man several years ago. However, the figure&#39;s approach definitely limits it a bit due to the Series 23 costume concept.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Snowman&#39;s pieces are pretty nice. His head is a mask that works best with the scarf, but okay without, and that mask has a flat stud on top that can accommodate many types of flat minifigure hat, including the old-style top hat here. The nose is a separate piece that plugs in with a bar attachment, and is a&nbsp;mini rubber carrot shape I think debuted for the Olaf minifigures. Two are in the bag. He comes with a red scarf, which is great, and his white legs and brown push broom are basic but nice pieces to have. His torso isn&#39;t useful for much besides a snowman or perhaps a vintage clown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>On the surface level, this is exactly what I&#39;ve been waiting for--a simple, classic cute snowman minifigure. The old-style top hat, red scarf, brown broom, and minimalist print make him feel nostalgic and charming and he&#39;s done really well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the head also brings up points I don&#39;t like. For one, it&#39;s a costume mask rather than a special sculpted head, and I&#39;m not a fan of that. I would have like this character to not have been depicted as a man in a costume because, outside of the context of the series, it adds nothing to the figure for him to work both ways. Sure, you can&#39;t tell it&#39;s a guy in a mask while he wears it, but I still would have preferred him to be&nbsp;depicted as a real magic snowman. The head is also a bit iffy because of the way it interacts with the scarf. It&#39;s not a uniform spheroid mask and is sculpted to fit neatly within the contours of the scarf, leaving the lower edge&nbsp;with concave curved sides that make it&nbsp;look less good when the scarf isn&#39;t on. The asymmetry of the scarf means the&nbsp;head also leaves a bit of a gap when the scarf is displayed with its draped tail on the front of the minifigure. The head underneath is okay, depicting a white cowl with a gap showing the sweating face of the minifigure inside who is very ironically sweltering in his costume. To be sure, the face-covered approach was the right choice because it gave us a figure that can be used as an anthropomorphic magic snowman...but I still wish we&#39;d gotten that as a non-costumed character. Or if the mask&nbsp;formula was necessary, make the head under the mask&nbsp;also printed up like a snowman with a coal-dot or button nose to provide an alternate display option for the character without the scarf and provide&nbsp;a highly useful part for brick-built snowmen. That would make the figure a lot more valuable than the dumb gag face of a sweaty man does.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall thoughts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>This is a really cute classic snowman and a funny costumed character, but the engineering of the costume limits its display options and the character may have been better with a bespoke molded head instead. It&#39;s up to you whether the costume aspect adds something or not, but I&#39;d still recommend the figure because it&#39;s mostly something we&#39;ve waited ages to get.</p>
