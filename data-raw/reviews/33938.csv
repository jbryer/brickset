<p>The hat incorporates the ears and hair. The hairpiece is flexible and is an unusual combination with the regular hard plastic that is used for the hat.</p>

<p>A dual sided face with friendly expressions is suitable for an Elf</p>

<p>The body looks perfect for this theme. The red collar on the green shirt and the belt that wrinkles the shirt looks great, just as the contrasting lime green arms.</p>

<p>Legs are dual moulded and look superb.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The attribute represents a snow globe and is made of some unique parts like the printed dome (standard transparent dome but with printed snowflakes) and the printed 1x1 reddish brown tile representing the house. The parts for the house are double in de poly bag, so you can build it twice and are perfect&nbsp; if you build microscale houses or so.&nbsp; (only 1 dome, just the 3 parts for the house).</p>

<p>Overall: I think it&#39;s a very nice figure that gives multiple opportunity&#39;s for use in MOC&#39;s, MOD&#39;s and is what you expect in the holiday theme. The snow globe is wonderful and I like the fact that you get twice the parts for the microscale house.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful for you, keep on building!</p>
