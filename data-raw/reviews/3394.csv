"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-10T12:36:02.187Z","Good For Construction","This is an average dumper truck. It comes with some rare pieces and good accesories. It has rare trunk piece, piece that picks up the trunk, other piece that moves the front part of the dumper from side-to-side, and a yellow seat. Shovel and broom are handy accesories for the minifigure. I like this kind of a construction minifigure, because unlike newer ones it has better looking uniform and one of the &quot;original&quot; facial expressions. Overall it is a nice set to start up or enhance your city construction site. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-01T10:15:18.843Z","LEGO Town (Construction) - Dumper Review","<p>This is a nice little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of good pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure. I also like the big yellow container on the back of this truck.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has one construction worker. This figure comes with a blue overalls, a red helmet and a beard on his face. It's very interesting that LEGO doesn't make faces like this anymore.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6535-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do much but it's a great addition to any LEGO city you're working on. The 'cockpit' does sviwel and the container on the back can be moved up. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver as well. This set may be smaller than the dump trucks you've seen in the LEGO City sets but it's still a good set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
