"peppermintmecha","2008-06-15T10:10:50.86Z","Contrary to the previous review...","Back in the day, this was one of my first sets, although the head has long since worn faceless and the white elements have faded to a colour not so bright, I still use them today. This set made a nice little plane that set me on the path to jet MOCs and it also had an alternative boat you could create from the elements. The fig was cool, an unshaven guy in blue sunglasses with a bomber jacket. It was a nice small set, pocket money priced and with a decent number of bricks. It wasn't to hard build/turn into a boat/rebuild for a beginner. So I give it a four, and it's not just the nostalgia speaking!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kairu","2009-11-13T13:19:14.717Z","My First LEGO set","I remember this fondly.  The first set that I ever purchased/received.  Don't remember which.

As a five (six?) year old, this set was it.  It has just enough pieces that you can build a variety of things.  I remember cars, planes, gliders, robots, cycles, and tons more!  The minifigure is a rugged-looking guy with a bomber jacket, perfect for those cool kids in the neighborhood.  I believe I still have the helmet and the wings but that's it!  So sad.  Trying to repurchase this now.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Korik4","2009-11-04T14:03:15.187Z","One of my first sets","  I do not remember buying this set, or when I first built or played with it, I just remember always having it and spending a lot of time playing with it. The plane is as it looks; simple, easy to build, and a lot of fun. 

  This set is a great alternative to the larger and more expensive planes at the time, and the minifig was a staple character for the storylines me and my friend made for Lego games. We called the stubbled, sunglasses-wearing man Max, just because he 'looks' like he's called Max. 

  I would recommend this if bought for a child as a toy, but to a serious Lego builder/collector, well, what you see is what you get with this one. I think you'll be able to make your own mind up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This is a neat first set and has been mentioned as such so this should be considered while picking it to pieces for its flaws.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>A super stylish brown leather flying jacket.</li><li>Strange blue shades and some dirty stubble.</li></ul><div>The blue shades look vile in that shape but mostly because the suspicious facial hair suggests a pilot who chooses three visors to hide behind, rarely shaving, dropping in only for fuel and whatever terrible acts only a paranoid kid could conceive.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Flying School</b></div><div>What a fun collection you could get of mini aircraft of all sorts to form a flying school or air strip society of crazy wing-nuts. This is a light aircraft design of some sort, most likely a 'microlight'. The blue nose brick makes a suitable aerodynamic front and leads to a streamed design of blue with a red line through it.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The pilot, his&nbsp;shaving error failing to be hidden by his blue, visored helmet,&nbsp;can sit in a cockpit of sorts with a single angled, tinted windscreen over the top with a hinge. Yet again, red, white and blue pervades the early 1990s set colour schemes and incorporates a broad white top wing of two plates. This is very similar to the real thing in shape although the less aesthetic windshield seems unnecessary as these open top craft don't often go out in terrible weather or at speed?&nbsp;The wing looks good and the build so far sits on a sturdy base and three suitable aircraft wheels. It has a cool little propeller and 'vent' on its back over a 'motor' no doubt and these two tails.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With the red safety lights and the simple slant bricks the tails look decent and smarten the thing up but the only irritation is in their propensity to be knocked off very easily. Its almost worth shifting them forward for a three stud lock down rather than the vulnerable two. These could have gone underneath with one longer plate to build them more strongly in place.</div><div><br></div><div>Its a fun little sky hopper of sorts and a nice set for that busy air school but there are some personal misgivings about it:</div><div><ul><li>Those weakly built tails.</li><li>The wing to body ratio.</li><li>The dodgy facial hair!</li></ul><div><b>Crash &amp; Burn</b></div><div>Thinking now, I bought this just for that unique flying jacket so I could 'make' Indiana Jones. It irritated me no end that it came with one of the least likeable MF heads I've ever seen.&nbsp;I'm sure it was aptly named 'Sky Bandit' somewhere and it deserves acknowledgment but nothing can put off a set more than unsuitable MFs which in this set is a shame because the craft itself is really good.</div></div>",TRUE,2,3,3,3,2
