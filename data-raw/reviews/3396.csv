"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-20T15:11:56Z","Unique set","This one gives you the impression of being very compact and very speedy. The black front contrasts nicely with the 3 bright colours at the rear end of the craft. Despite being able to move the motors at the back of it, i found them annoying as they kept falling off. I'd probably link the two together to make them stronger. Otherwise, I'd leave it as it is.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T04:45:36.45Z","Sleek and Stylish…","Black and red are the main colour schemes here, and this works really well for me.   There is a red ‘grating’ just underneath the cockpit moulding while further abaft is a pair of handles.   The twin outboards are mounted on brackets on the transom, these raise and lower which is especially important when entering low water areas such as a beach or for when the engines require work.   The multi-coloured design behind the cockpit breaks up what some could call the monotony of the black / red theme, this works well and can even be re-arranged if more than one of these sets are to be used together.

I wonder how the skipper feels about the amount of water which could come over the cockpit surround.   I have added a small windshield to mine (part number 4865 transparent blue panel) which doesn’t detract from the sleekness of the craft, this can be removed for racing purposes as it could interfere with the drag coefficient! 

The skipper looks cool in his racing suit and life vest and his dark visor matches the ‘dark’ look for the craft.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not one I would have bought, too many of these small boats that I seem to constantly pick up or come across don't have a unifying theme other then boats. If I want a racing boat, I'd hope for more like it to really build up a scenario. The color scheme throws me off too, it's starts off being black with red highlights and then ends with a ""rainbow"" effect of the primary colors. Just not something I would have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's one minifigure, who's wearing&nbsp;a life jacket and has a visored helmet. I suppose it's alright, just if I was buying a set brand new from the store, this wouldn't have been one of them.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,5
