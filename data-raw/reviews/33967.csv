<p>&nbsp; Now with that out of the way let&#39;s get on to the set. This set was a free gift with purchase from Walmart and LEGO if you bought a certain amount of Lego sets from the later retailer. So I thought well&nbsp;I have been wanting to get a few LEGO sets anyway so why not? So I bought the LEGO sets and sent in a picture of my order to the supplied email account. I then received a reply stating that I qualified and I would be receiving my gift with purchase soon. Soon must be a relative term. Three weeks later I received my set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Packaging/Build-&nbsp;It was packaged inside a mailing bag. Inside it contained two ziplock bags with all the parts and instructions. The build was pretty straight forward. The most interesting part was building the base and the top of the castle.</p>

<p>Parts-&nbsp;The only special part was a specially printed Nexo knight shield tile with the ninetieth anniversary logo printed on it. Otherwise no special parts.</p>

<p>Playability- Basically none you can raise and lower the drawbridge by hand that&#39;s it. It is definitely a display model.</p>

<p>Price threshold for this was fifty dollars. It&#39;s cheaper threshold than some of the gift with purchases LEGO has been making recently.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Honestly it was free I was planning to get some LEGO sets&nbsp;from Walmart anyway so it was worth it to me. I would probably not buy this set&nbsp;second hand. Unless you&#39;re a collector and then I would buy it as soon as possible before the price skyrockets in a&nbsp;couple of years. I hope you find this review helpful and keep on building.</p>
