The car is very &quot;flexible&quot; since the roof could be removed easily to make a converdable. Unlike some newer sets this car actually has doors. Also the minifigure looks cool. Overall good set to own. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The car comes with a removable top and the minifig looks like he loves his car. A must own for any town collection. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pickwick","2010-09-20T07:50:24.17Z","Une des plus belles voitures LEGO","<p>Elle a du style, un look vraiment très réussi : moteur apparent, petit pare-brise, capote avec toit ouvrant, grosses roues à l'arrière.</p>
<p>Sympathique à monter, elle a un charme rétro inimitable.</p>
<p>Même le propriétaire avec son blouson de cuir reste dans le ton de cette boîte.</p>

"szerman","2009-12-21T13:33:45.857Z","One of my favourite small cars","This is my third Lego set. It has very cool looks like a muscle car, big motor, bigger wheelers in his backside than in front, the doors and nice roof with a window. The minifig has co cool black jacket :) I got it in Christmas in 1996, but today I don't have the red doors :( I'm sorry for my poor English :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Not much else that others have said but I do find the roof doesn't sit well when the figures inside the car-the bricks behind him slightly raise off the 1 x 4 brick behind his back...bit disappointed by that but thats the only negative gripe.<div><br></div><div>Perhaps Lego should have done the car in yellow and red instead? Recommend it though to any AFOL!</div>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"sunriva","2011-03-12T04:33:05.42Z","Great fun little car for any Lego City","<p>Great little car which worked well in any town layout. Very creative use of bricks allowed many customisation options to make your own rod. I enjoyed using the car more as a convertible and could never figure out the perfect cylinder angle for the variable engine blocks :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-22T11:30:21.193Z","LEGO Town (Vehicles) - Rebel Roadster Review","<p>This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 57 pieces and it was 4.50 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio was 9 cents per piece which is a really good value for this little model.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set only has one minifig. The driver has a black suit and a white cap.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6538-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do much but it's still very fun to maneuver it. The doors can be opened on each side and on the front you can see a very nice looking engine which you can adjust as well. The top can be opened very easily as well. I really like the design of this car and I think it's a good addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-09T19:20:42.53Z","Red Hot Hot Rod","<p>Welcome back to Lego Town. Here with the ongoing use of bow bricks, we see vehicles start to receive some interesting design innovations.</p>

The build is a short but sweet activity seeing as the black hood and its cool downward tilt is on to a car body that is not the largest ever.&nbsp;This matters not as the meaty engine pokes out of the bonnet and there is a tiny little styling that has been shown on the front with a rad knob or similar. The front tiny windscreen is novel and effective.&nbsp;The whole tilt of big wheels to small makes you wonder why it had not been done more before for a fuller&nbsp;subtheme&nbsp;of hot rods, convertibles and drag racing,&nbsp; The larger set is good for getting the value of 3 cars but this remains a worthy design and excellent addition to the traffic of vehicles a Town inevitably gets. Too many cars can be a bad thing but little gems like this make jamming up the road plates an enjoyable experience. Broom!</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
- nice minifig<br>- well designed car<br>- good parts<br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<br>
<p>Another good civil car set with one minifig, truly a legend. Shouldn't be missed in any collection. This freak still running wild today.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
