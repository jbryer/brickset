Overall it's a great set.  The truck is interesting because it has 3 spots to hold cargo, however it does not seem too long or unstable.  Four early system style containers are always great to get in a set to use with my train/harbor/town layout.  The forklift is awesome although I lost the spring and the lift part was chewed by my dog.  It still works great though.  Last aspect worth commenting on are the little racecars which are also awesome.  

Overall this set is amazing and I recommend that you pick this up.  It is surprisingly cheap 14 years later and wont kill your wallet.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-02-27T21:54:22.327Z","Super Cool Set","This set is can described in few words, which are super cool. I like the semi truck and the multi-color design on it. The go carts that can be in crates are also cool and can be transported. The winner's circle is pretty awesome. Overall, this set is a classic and is one of the best town sets of the early 90s.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"barbarossa82","2016-01-18T17:35:02.407Z","Strong set with minor gripes","<p>As most of the other reviews will tell you, this relatively large set was great fun both to build and to play with, and is an asset to any collection because of the good variety of individual elements it contains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I, however, want to focus on the few aspects of this set that struck me as imperfect or disappointing; not becuase they spoil the set or make it not worth having (they aren&#39;t anywhere near severe enough for that), but because they are of interest in showing how just a few small oversights in set design can affect its overall feeling. They remind us of how much we should appreciate sets where more&nbsp;thought has been given to fine detail and the underlying &quot;logic&quot; of the scene.</p>

<p>So what am I talking about? It&#39;s a number of small individual issues.</p>

<p>First, there are four crates, one for each of the tiny race cars. However, there is only room for three on the back of the truck. How does the fourth car in its crate get to the next race? Either you stack it on top of the other three on the trailer, or you simply carry it on the forklift; but in either case it just falls off the moment you move the vehicle, and it makes things look poorly thought-out. With just a little more thought and a few extra bricks, there could have been a simple locking or fixing mechanism to secure it in either of these places, or alternatively the truck&#39;s trailer could have been a longer, centrally articulated vehicle, enabling it to seat all four crates.</p>

<p>Second, the only way to insert or remove the cars from their crates is to break off the headrest, slide the car in from the side and then replace the headrest through the hole in the roof. It feels awkward and it doesn&#39;t hold them very well. Ideally, the crates should have had hinged roofs, which would have allowed the cars to be moved in and out without partial disassembly.</p>

<p>The white, red and green car is clearly in Octan livery, and matches the Octan minifig. Why no printed brick at the front to carry the Octan logo?</p>

<p>What happens to the third and fourth minifigs when the &quot;show goes on the road&quot;? Neither has a separate vehicle and they can&#39;t fit into the truck or the forklift, which are already occupied.</p>

<p>This list probably makes this review sound churlish and unappreciative. It&#39;s not intended as such, because this is still a great set and one which brought me a lot of enjoyment as a kid. It is simply meant to show that the sort of attention to detail that turns a good set into a great one&nbsp;isn&#39;t found everywhere, and is all the more valuable where it is.</p>
