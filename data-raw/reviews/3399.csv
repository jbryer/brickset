"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-19T14:49:59Z","My first set ever!","What this set really needs is another floor, and that big gap on the top floor could of been used to create some sort of small jail cell. 
I have to disagree, this set does not lack playability: I've spent hours making water and road police chases those log years ago... However, it works far better with other Police and Harbour sets- I've always wanted to put all of these types of sets together to make a huge port road sort of thing.

Also, It is interesting to see how the cars have changed from the 1990s to those in the new 2003 series. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-03-29T07:44:46.253Z","law and order","as the set number suggests this set can be seen as an addition to the harbour sets 6541 and 6542. it matches perfectly in construction (e.g. the pier plates) and look, so the combination of all three sets is a must (i certainly tried it already, a huge ensemble in the end). 
there are many small and lovely details on it, 2 boats, a car, and a motorbike plus old-school policemen. how i long for the old harbour-sets, their sober beauty and functionality, their intricate simplicity!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-10-28T17:00:51.34Z","Best little police station","I like how the building came out on this one. It is small, but sleek, and that works well here. No jail cell, but so what. The plates are interesting, wish they made more sets with them (even for normal Town sets). I like how they tried a different design for the police car as it kind of helps it to stand out. The main boat is great, and it fits in perfectly with any other pier/shipyard set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"absolutelylez","2008-12-16T10:39:25.107Z","My first set!","This was my first set so I might be a little biased but I'll try not to.

The set was released in the 90s and thus has some traditional &quot;Lego architecture&quot; associated with that period, which today makes it seem a bit old and quaint. The bricks were basic but still very useful. Floors were 5 bricks high. The Police station I found to be a bit inadequate, being a little boy I insisted on building a jail area in the empty bit above the first floor, so I guess that gave playability scope! The set itself is highly playable, with two boats, a classic Police car and motorbike. The motorbike was very easy to damage. The radar post too.

Otherwise, a classic little set with great potential for alterations (doubling the dock, connecting it to other docks, adding a fire station or hospital on the side maybe).

I'll give 4, as for 5 i'd want an extra floor or helicopter area, or better improved quais for the boats to dock at.

"krysto2002","2008-07-28T07:41:01.997Z","A mini harbor police station, what'll they think of next!?","This is one of my favorite police sets, but for its size, could use one or two more minifigures... The set includes plenty: a car (that looks more like a Scion &quot;cardboard box car&quot;), a classic motorcycle (with he old plastic windshield attachment), a police boat (with tons of accessories and playability, including a winch to haul in wrecked or stranded ships), a civilian motorboat (cool, but small, easily replaced by any other boat from the series or any other LEGO boat), and a small station that, though small and lacking a staircase (big con) is detailed with both a reception office with a waiting chair and flowers, as well as a telephone and upper office (for the chief no doubt). The set has plenty of details and can be slapped onto any display since the ramp can attach to road plates, and the pier leads straight to whatever whater your display includes. The set tops off with the finishing details: a sign, lightpost, radar, fences, outside details on the base, and finally those bars on the outside of the baseplates which serve no apparent purpose other than filling the holes and making the set really, really cool.

At over $40 originally, this was way overpriced, for the lack of parts and figures, but if you can find it used for a decent price (I got mine for $20) then by all means add this to your collection. A must-have for any boat, police, or town fan!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"piratetown","2010-11-18T05:51:30.707Z","1991 was the year of the docks","This is a really good set that fits in well with the other port sets. <br>There is good detail on the dock and the vehicles are a good mix. Thankfully, there is no micro-copter. The small &amp; medium boat combo is a good idea, and you get four policemen, two with classic white hats. The medium sized boat has a winch for towing or mooring - very useful, and adds to playability and appearance. <br>The station itself is small, but is relatively easy to expand and gives you a good amount of glass windows. <br>The car is slightly flimsy/plain, but then again can be seen as a simple design classic of the glory years.<br>If you can pick it up for a decent price, do so, put perhaps don't make it the main police station, at least not without expansion.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"albcheng123","2009-09-18T23:08:27.327Z","A classical base set in Early 90s","The set is the only police station I own, although it is not a big one.  The set comes from the 1991's port series, and the ""pier police"" base poses the classical old-school architecture.

Of course, the officers have to transfer the suspects to bigger police station with a jail  :)

Combined with pursuit squad (6354), the coastal area should be free from illegal smuggling and other undesirable events.


Pros:
- A police petrol boat, a speeder, a motocycle & a petrol car,which offers lots of fun
- The polic boat is pretty decent with good details (a rope for multi-tasks), and it may carry up to 2 minifigs
- 4 different police officer minifigs
A port base plate which is compatible with other road base plates
- 3 life-jackets
- Ok outlook for the police building with plenty pieces of ""stripped windows""

Cons:
The building could be little bit bigger with more interior details, maybe with a prison
The top part of the little speeder boat could be further improved

"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-09T12:39:42.623Z","Another Wave Of Justice","<p>The harbour was an interesting and integral part of Town sets that eventually got its own cop shop. While not essential as our Police States expanded exponentially, this was an interesting release for waterfront crime prevention.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>Marked down here a little because a lack of diversity was apparent in some uniforms. A uniform is after all designed to be repeated but a couple of Police roles could have warranted a new print. The life jackets were great though. Err what no frogman?</p>

<p><strong>Fog Patrol</strong><br />
For vehicles, you get some nice small builds here in the shape of a nifty police hatchback that looks pretty zippy and very white, another white motorbike and a cool little speedboat with&nbsp;red striped outboard motor. The main power launch is much more substantial&nbsp;with jet propulsion, and a string and winch to connect it safely to the dock.&nbsp; It has a radio keypad and loud speaker for shouting over the water at wrong doers etc. Also portside and starboard lights, a searchlight and siren are attached to good effect. The sunroof adds to the otherwise simplistic design. It has anti friction pads to glide on underneath. A floating boat would have been better for the money which by now was comparable to previously bigger sets of the same type but hey not an issue.</p>

<p>So the attraction in this set is the harbour&nbsp;plates. These chunky blocks give height to lift builds above the water and anything you want. The ramp allows this access to standard road plates. Height would have been good in general for most buildings to rise above streets and roads slightly and achieve low ground, as such baseplates remain at water level with only the harbour&nbsp;sets making a wall between. Even the harbour pieces get&nbsp;feet to rise them up further.</p>

<p>While multiple black frames glass panels&nbsp;make up the lower walls, an excellent harbour extending little pier with steps is included for the launch. A radio-telephone sits&nbsp;at a desk with chair that matches the radio on the launch. A bunch of flowers sits at another desk with chair for some welcome internal decoration, how thoughtful. White pillars hold&nbsp;structure and allow access at the back. The upstairs rooms have the tape recorder and computer equipment you may have come to expect.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Awooga!</strong><br />
The finishing touches really make the set complete: roof beacon, antenna&nbsp;and siren, flower stand, large radar dish, &#39;lit up&#39; police sign, lifebelt stand, red and white harbour&nbsp;edge warning strips, red safety barriers&nbsp;and the boat tie off points. I have but one question: why would you not include at least one police frogman? It seems incomprehensible but there you go, not a keeper necessarily&nbsp;if you have another station you prefer but very good if you want an extensive harbour.</p>
