Yah it's empty, but it looks very nice. Five minifigs, four glasses, a parrot and a palm tree. A nice addition to a Tropical town. It only takes about a dozen of the 1x2x6 white columms that are growing ever more popular in sets, to fill the unecessary spaces in this. I imagine putting two back to back would make it look more complete also. 178 pieces, or something like that. A lot of flowers. I'm glad for the re-release as a Legend of this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T23:46:09Z","Stylish but flimsy","I eventually caved in and bought this set cheap at ebay.  It simply has the best classic town figures and the restaraunt is perfect for a rich area of Lego town.  

On the downside, it's a little expensive and the bricks are somewhat juniorised , so it's not a good set for building alternate models with unless you buy multiples.

I recommend this set to anyone who wants decent lego figures and a restaraunt for their lego town, but there are better sets out there.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-24T15:05:29Z","Good set","This Restaurant is cool,but flimsy.It fell apart,after pushing too hard.Well that,comes from the big pieces.But I don't blame it as juniorized.Altough it's a little bit simplified and a very open design. Not,because of the open back,but because of the fences in the upper floor.It seems,that it is for tropical to sub-tropical settings,because of the warm climate of these areas.
Now to the Price:
In my opinion ,the price is ok for a medium-sized Town set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
