The floating ones are terrible. You want the extra build time in these boats. I feel like these boats are way more fun. I definitely like that you can change out the engines and take them into the shop and tune them up. </p>

<p>This set is a great addition to any city on a harbor. The cafe on the end always became a great night spot for my city especially after a big day or pushing it to the limit in the high powered boats that are included in the set. I like the versatility of the set. I used this pretty much as my marina. All you have to do is add more slips and it works great for the addition of more boats. Plus the crane always comes in handy when you need to fix a boat or two. The realism in this set is great as it portrays many of the same ideas at a true marina. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only downer to the ste is the seaplane. I find the base to be wobbly and breaks off a lot. It's still a good idea, but I've never been a seaplane fane. It's just kind of a bonus in this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is great and I hope that the new marina sets are similar and build on this great set. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I remember seeing this set as a youngster and liking it then, being interested in harbours, marinas, boats etc.   The set is awesome, no other way to describe it, and at over 700 pieces it is a BIG piece of kit when assembled.   The set encompasses seven main parts:

The Workshop is reached via a slight ramp and features an area for repair / servicing of various pieces of marine equipment including outboard motors, inboard engines etc.   This area also boasts a workbench with machinery and what looks to be an upright drill press.  There is also a rack for storing tools, a dustbin, fire extinguisher and a marine engine awaiting repair.   This is all housed in a utilitarian white building with an attractive red canopy.   The Octan logo is displayed above and there are two flags flying on flag staffs on the roof.   Located at the side of the workshop is an indicator board displaying the times of the various races of the day.

The Yacht Clubhouse is located adjacent to the workshop and overlooks the mooring pontoons.   The building is a bright yellow colour with red window frames and full-length picture windows.   There is also an attractive green and white canopy over the external viewing / sitting area in the form of a terrace bordered by a low yellow wall and red crisscross fence panels.   Inside the building, immediately on the left is a small shop area where on display is an outboard motor on a rack and a life preserve.   This area could be described as a little sparse, but extra items could be added.   Also in this area is a radar screen and a till point mounted on a blue counter.   At the other side of this counter is a duplicate counter with beer tap and glasses, ready for use.   Adjacent to the bar counter is a small round table with parasol, again overlooking the marina and pontoons.   Three steps lead down to a small pontoon with a lighthouse.   The clubhouse is mounted on grey arch-style supports adjacent to the boat moorings.

The Wharf and Fuel Pump is accessed from the quayside and features three pontoons, one wide and long at the one end the fuel pump is sited.   Two smaller pontoons jut out from the main wharf; these are grey in colour and are mounted on black supports.   There are also grey drains and blue mooring bollards for securing the moored boats.   The fuel pump is a standard Octan model with hose and nozzle attached.   The location of the pump means that boats can moor up and refuel in two or three possible moorings, either at the side of the wharf or next to the smaller pontoon.

The Crane and Dry Dock Area is located directly in front of the workshop.   The crane is sited so that it can swivel and allow the lifting of boats from the wharf onto the dry dock cradle area or onto a vehicle parked outside the workshop for transportation.   The crane features a useful bracket which can be attached to any of the boats for easy lifting and the operation of such is straightforward.   Blue ladders are in place on the quayside for accessing the water in the wharf area.   The dry dock cradle area features black supports that form the cradle where boats can be worked on out of the water.  There is also a set of wall-mounted blue access ladders for hull / keel work and higher up is a platform to allow work to be carried on the topsides.

The Boats, three in total include two offshore power boats, one in white, and the other in red along with a small rescue boat with outboard motor and start / finish flag again mounted on a staff.   The white boat features the Octan logo on the side decks, clean white lines and the Octan logos on the hull sides also.   There is also a rear hatch arrangement which allows access to the engine.   White fins and an arch are provided which are decorated with small red antennae.   The red boat is slightly longer than the Octan craft, and again features a clean red hull with decorative stripe.   The engine is also housed underneath a hatch arrangement and there is a second hatch allowing access to a small cuddy cabin located in the forepeak.   This boat also features twin red fins and a white arch again with radio antennae.   Both of these boats have studs on their undersides from which a sense of speed and being ‘up on the plane’ can be achieved.   The small rescue / judge boat is no-frills and features a streamlined windshield; outboard engine which tilts and the all-important flag.

The Plane is black and red and features a stubble-faced pilot complete with life preserve.   The fuselage is mounted on a yellow raft making landing on water possible.   This area has red support stanchions which are mounted to the fuselage.   The rest of the plane features an open cockpit, navigation lights and a forward mounted engine with propeller.

The Octan Truck is presented in traditional Octan colours and livery, the truck is white / red / green and features a basic cab with sunroof and flat bed behind with opening rear panel.   The various accessories with the set can be stored / transported in this way.

All in all an outstanding set, well done Lego!   If you haven’t got this in your collection I strongly advise getting it as it is a great addition to any collection, there are always what seem to be good boxed examples moving through eBay, mine was like new, in fact I am convinced it had been built and placed on display somewhere.  

Enjoy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
