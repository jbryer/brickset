"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-11T19:40:59Z","Nice Set for a space theme....","Pros/Cons Anyone???

Pros:
COOL robot thing that builds the shuttle
IS this the only plane launcher in LEGO???I think so...
SHUTTLE buggy thing is neat and gets the astronaut to the plane, FAST!
OXYGEN packs needed for a space theme is, present
PRICE: Over priced but, what the heck...
Cons:
STICKERS are ok, but are in almost all space theme sets(why don't they just make the pieces with the stickers built on(oh yeah these dudes call that &quot;making special pieces..&quot;))

"jd5775","2007-08-11T00:34:45.3Z","One of my favorites","This is one of my favorite lego sets.  I remember getting this when I was like 5 and building it.  The jet is nice and contains a rather spacious interior (for 4 stud planes) along with 4 cabinets for suitcases and a cargo vault at the back.  The Shuttle is also a good addition, but they come in almost every launch set.  I also like the little guide truck with the tow.

My favorite part about the box art on the set would have to be the background (I love lego backgrounds).  A desert sunset with a satellite dish, a launch pad in the distance and a faded moon.  Those backgrounds are so cool.  Overall good classic town/space set and one of the last good sets created.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T22:45:37.86Z","Space Shuttle + Jumbo Jet = Awesome!","Here are my Pros &amp; Cons - 


Pros:
Jumbo jet
Space Shuttle number II (since that is what the cargo door stickers say)
Car puller
You can get both the Shuttle AND a jet...so 2 themes for 1 set.

Cons:

Can't think of any.

This is def. a must have set because not only it has a Space Shuttle, but it gives you an idea what NASA in a way does.  Because yes, they have a truck puller, and the jumbo jet as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J_tje","2010-03-18T08:19:43.5Z","Let's bring that Shuttle home","I think most of us can recall the pictures where a (real) space shuttle is transported on the back of a jumbo jet, this set is such a cool Legostyle reproduction that you've got to love it. <br><br>I stumbled across/bought this set in my quest for all Lego airplanes, but it gave my collection a different direction all together. (I'm now into (sub)themes, with planes/flight as a special interest). The Launch Command series is a very rewarding theme to collect. :)<br><br>It's super playable when you put it together with set 6336. (response unit). You search, find and take the shuttle home. Also works great on airport/launching facilities or a combination thereof. <br><br>This set comes with the 3 version of the shuttle which I find the best, complete with satellite and robot arm. The plane is special too with lots of storage room, and tools. (and as a bonus Lego even included a little (airport) guidance car.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"Chris_Diehl","2012-03-21T23:20:04.39Z","One of the best sets I own","<p>Considering that there are plenty of other reviewers out there and most of the sets I have are 15+ years old, my reviews are going have a much different angle to them versus a build straight out of a sealed box from the store. Maybe this style may actually help someone in a similar situation, or just be an entertaining read about the durability and uniqueness of its parts. My criteria will be more based upon survivability of a set after being built, played with, disassembled, and its parts reused in multiple other configurations as many kids will do. Next will be my ability to find its parts that have been stored in a Rubbermaid tub for over a decade, and to see what wear and tear may have affected it. Keep in mind that I have over 50 sets stored in multiple containers where they have remained for 10-15 years. I have also somewhat sorted them out as best I can to speed up the part search process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Technically this was my younger brother's set so this was my first time building it.&nbsp; This definitely has to be the coolest town themed set I own, and overall one of the best of all themes.&nbsp; Lots of moving parts, opening hatches, flexible space arm and mini satellite make this a cool build when finished.&nbsp; Plus the astronaut minifig is awesome looking!&nbsp; Many of this set's pieces are fairly unique and made this a bit difficult to find all of the required parts out of my various tubs.&nbsp; The shuttle's rounded engine covers, cargo doors &amp; tail fin (with decals still attached amazingly) and wheels are pretty unique and easy to find.&nbsp; The flexible space arm though was a huge pain to find all the parts for as they are 100% unique to this set (at least for my collections) and are very hard to find when disassembled as mine was.&nbsp; I was very lucky that the cargo doors with the decals across them had not been separated otherwise that aspect would not be reproducible.&nbsp; The mini satellite also has decals on the hinge pieces which were also a huge pain to try and find.&nbsp; If it weren't for the specific decals, the parts are fairly common, but finding those 2 specific parts can be quite difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The airplane &amp; shuttle truck were pretty easy to find parts for and build compared to the shuttle.&nbsp; The large plane wings, tail fin, and blue colored hatch pieces were very easy to find.&nbsp; The tiny green &amp; red studs used as lights are pretty standard, yet difficult to find in a tub full of other parts.&nbsp; With the exception of the decals being as fragile and unique as they are, overall this set can survive well over the years without any problems.&nbsp; God forbid you ever disassemble the space arm though as it will take you many painstaking hours to find all of them again as it did me.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Many unique parts from the jet engines, windshields, wings and shuttle base pieces</li><li>Many moveable parts make for a cool set upon finishing</li><li>3 different vehicles &amp; a very cool astronaut minifig</li><li>One of the coolest looking sets ever</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Decals...&nbsp; Why does it have to be decals?</li><li>Some of the smaller pieces such as the space arm technic ones are impossible to find once taken apart and dumped into a bin with other set pieces</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall an awesome set that will survive the test of time as long as you don't separate parts held together by decals.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

<p>The set is part of a theme called &#39;Launch Command&#39;, launched in 1995. The theme contains 5 sets:</p>

</ul>

<p>As with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6339-1/Shuttle-Launch-Pad"">6339 Shuttle Launch Pad</a> I bought this recently second hand. The booklet was missing but that didn&#39;t set me back. After a few minutes on the old internet I found a downloadable booklet.</p>

<p>The set includes</p>

<ul>
	<li>3 minifigs, 1 austronaut and 2 workmen</li>
	<li>a (massive) airplane</li>
	<li>a airplane puller vehicle</li>
	<li>and a Space Shuttle (numbered &#39;3&#39;). Space Shuttle number &#39;2&#39; is the Shuttle in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6339-1/Shuttle-Launch-Pad"">6339 Shuttle Launch Pad</a>. Where is number 1 I hear you say? Perhaps it is the Shuttle in set 1992s<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6346-1/Shuttle-Launching-Crew"">6346 Shuttle lancing Crew</a>. This shuttle differs from the two shuttles above, and it isn&rsquo;t numbered. But since it bears the same logo as the 1995 Town Space Sets, it seems reasonable to think this is number 1.&nbsp;</li>

<h3><u><strong>Review</strong></u></h3>

<p><strong>The airplane</strong></p>

<p>It is supposed to be a Boeing 747, in fact it resembles the real airplane used by NASA. It color scheme is quiet obvious a wink. Both the LEGO Shuttle carrier as NASA&#39;s real deal, has a blue-white-red color-scheme.</p>

<p>The airplane is much bigger then it&#39;s civilian nephew from set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6392-1/Airport"">6392 Airport</a>. The wings are an additional 4 studs wider (2 studs on each side) and 4 to six studs longer. 2 minifigs can be seated, one as a pilot and the other behind the pilot as navigator. There are two compartments, one for the navigator, the other at the backend of the plane. Aside, there are also, little cargo doors to hold equipment, like a srewdriver, can oil, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Space Shuttle number 3</strong></p>

<p>The Space Shuttle is very nice and looks just like NASA&#39;s real Space Shuttle. Since this sets dates from 1995, the white bricks had the yellowing problem, luckily in an early stage&nbsp;. Please read my review of&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6339-1/Shuttle-Launch-Pad""><strong>6339 Shuttle Launch Pad</strong></a> (<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/50841"">read my review here</a>), for some more detail and a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Shuttle is very nice, has cargo doors and a satellite to deliver in deep space.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Airplane puller vehicle</strong></p>

<p>A very simple airplane puller vehicle. Nothing more, nothing less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u><strong>Playability</strong></u></h3>

<p>Playability is kind of limited I guess. First fly the plane over to where the Shuttle is located, load it, and then fly back to wherever you want (probably the Launch Pad Site). However, it is a nice and necessary addition to Space theme. It is just not complete without is. Some images are just branded in kinds eyes forever. For me, one of those images are the Space Shuttle and the Boeiing caring the Space Shuttle.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u><strong>Aging</strong></u></h3>

<p>I feel it aged very well. The Space Shuttle is today still very spot on. The plane is also still good looking, however, comparing it with 2016&#39;s sets is comparing David with Goliath. I for one however, still prefer the older planes from Town in stead of today&#39;s City planes. These are just to big. When you have a City layout, I feel that the planes are way out of proportion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><u><strong>Box / instructions</strong></u></h3>

<p>I don&#39;t have the instructions nor the box. However, I have a downloaded version of the instructions and it is just a ordinary instruction A4-booklet as we know from this time period.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><u>Overall</u></strong></h3>

<p>Combined with the Space Shuttle Launch Pad, the playability is great. As a stand alone however, I feel it is more limited.&nbsp;</p>
