The Helecopter is the strongest point. It is the best looking plane or copter. It seats two minifigs, pilot and navigator. Sometimes i take of the blades and tail and pretend it is a shuttlecraft form Star Trek. The boat and van are good too. And it comes with 3 minifigs and lots of tools and accessories. A great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dfoley4","2010-03-14T01:20:57.73Z","Great Fun","A well designed set with lots of features. The helicopter is definitely the focal point and very well built. It seats two figures and has plenty of storage. The van is similarly well built with a rear hatch and boat/trailer. Everything in this set works together very nicely i.e. there is a place for every tool, accessory, and mini figure. Nothing seems to be left out.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
