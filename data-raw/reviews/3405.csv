"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-02T17:20:21Z","Good and simple ","When I was 5 (i think) got this set ,but being young I took It a part and re built it. Then I wanted to make the orgionale but couldn't find some peices. So I bought another one. If you Find this in a store I highly recomend it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-09T12:32:29Z","Best small Racecar","This is the best of the 3 classic LEGO Town racecars. It's a pretty nice design and the size is right for a small minifig Set. The minifig is more detailed, than those in the older two racers I own. And the whole design is more realistic than the other two ones. There are even smooth wheels, which give this a better realism.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-10T13:16:35.873Z","Easy To Get","This is the easiest F1 race car to get. The other F1 race cars are sold in much larger sets, which are much harder to get. I like  this set(and this type of cars) because they look cool with their realistic design. The &quot;octan&quot; signs and  pieces with #4 on them are not stickers, which means that they would not come off, but stay on for long time. I like all-red race minifigure. Overall good race car for affordable price. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-01T10:23:41.137Z","LEGO Town (Racing) - Slick Racer Review","<p>This is a fun little model to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of useful pieces for future MOC's and/or brickfilms. I also like the printed tiles with the 'Octan' logo on it.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The driver has a red overall and a red helmet with some white stars on it. On his face we can see black shades as well.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to complain about stickers.<br></p>

The only play feature which this set has is that the rear-wing can be adjusted. The driver fits in his cockpit very nice and easy. I really like the design of this car.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
