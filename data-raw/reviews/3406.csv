It is so much better than Belville i can just tell you that. It is a little barbyish, and pink and gorly but every town has something like that. The cool lego swing and the little stand with radios. This is a cool set. I'm a boy at 13 years of age and me and my brother have a fantasticly big town. (Fighter jock by the way). Paradisa is something I haven't got around to getting yet but if i do, it will be the resort and this set right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

That was real 'girly' (not only of course) Lego - and if Lego's target is also a girl's world (as they say about Bellville) they should get back on that way. Paradisa was so pink but cool - it wasn't 'different' Lego, but our old, so well-known Lego who everybody loves. I remember when I got it as a small girl it was best gift for me! Besides it Paradisa had so many unique or pioneer pieces - like in this set - the swing, mini-train, ice-cream (if I see well), puppy and new image of woman minifig - new haircut, new face, new clothes. I don't have 6547 (just a few other Paradisa) but it's on my list!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
