<p>The Halloween is looming and the LEGO Group is preparing for another special Gift With Purchase (GWP) for us and this time it comes from the Creator 3 in 1 line. As usual, for Creator 3 in 1 set, I will only build and discuss the main build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/b51e682f-03f9-46dc-8f4c-5b76fb77035b/40562-1.jpg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>We can see a nice&nbsp;smiling witch. But we do not know whether she is friendly or she is just happy thinking of what she can do during the Halloween season. Hopefully, this mystical witch would not steal all of our LEGO sets. The witch is holding her magic wand and broom. She is accompanied by a green frog, a spider and a&nbsp;pumpkin.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/5ca329ff-6d6a-4b7f-9cef-1c421d702391/40562-2.jpg?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Let us look closer to the accessories accompanying the witch. The pumpkin is simply made up from bricks. The green frog and the black spider are from the standard animal mould which available readily. It is a bit strange seeing animal not created from bricks on Creator 3 in 1 set.</p>

<p>Both arms are using ball joint connections. The ball joints are also used on the wrists. The usage of ball joints is such that we can more freely orientate the arms and wrists for posing. Unfortunately, it does not help much since we can not do anything on the lower part of the witch build (no legs) for better posing.</p>

<p>The torso of the witch can be rotated 360 degree which is shown above. Unfortunately, the rear side of the torso and head are just simple plates. The LEGO Designer should add more LEGO parts to make the back sides of the torso and head to look more sophisticated instead of blank plates like those.</p>

<p>There are three different booklets for the main build that is the Mystic Witch and for the side builds, the Mystic Cat and Mystic Dragon.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The set is fun to build. After building large and detailed sets, getting a break by building this seasonal set is refreshing. Setting that aside, building this Mystic Witch feels nice to me.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts are not sufficient. The frog and spiders should be brick-build instead of moulded animals!</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Not much okay value here. Most people will only display this set during Halloween or for completing their Creator 3 in 1 collection display.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Getting this as GWP with only &pound;100 / $100 / &euro;100 threshold is&nbsp;not bad compared to other GWPs.&nbsp;</p>
