<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned above, this is the first Ninjago magazine gift that is not packaged in the standard foil pack. Instead, the Crystal King comes in a paper bag, which is exactly the same size as the previous foil packs. The layout is also the same, but the new bags have yellow borders on the bottom and top.</p>

<p>While I think&nbsp;it&#39;s great that LEGO is switching&nbsp;to paper packaging and is trying to become more environmentally friendly, a big problem with the new paper bags in magazines is the lack of a foil cover for the magazine itself. This means that the only thing that&#39;s holding the bag to&nbsp;the cover of the magazine is a small bit of glue, which is not enough. When I went to the store to buy it, the paper bag had come off from the magazine and I had to look for it. Fortunately, I managed to find it, but I saw a lot of other LEGO magazines that were also missing the magazine gift, which is not a good thing.</p>

<p>Also, I find it hilarious that the front of the packaging spoils&nbsp;the Crystal King&#39;s identity, although I guess it&#39;s fine since the season ended almost two months ago and pretty much everyone predicted him to be the Overlord a while back.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The building experience is nothing special as&nbsp;it&#39;s just a normal&nbsp;minifigure with a fairly simple brick-built sword.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting parts in this set are the Crystal King&#39;s helmet and mask, which only appear in the more expensive Crystalized sets. Both of them look great&nbsp;and I can see them being very useful for custom minifigs, but I would have wished for the mask to be more accurate to how it looks like&nbsp;in the show.</p>

<p>The only other non-minifigure parts are a gunmetal-gray sword and lightsaber&nbsp;hilt, and two very nice transparent pink parts that&nbsp;I can never get enough of.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The character included here is the Overlord in his Crystal King form. I love all the&nbsp;details on his torso and legs, which do a great job of representing the Overlord&#39;s most important features, mainly the golden ribcage and his symbol in the middle. His face underneath the mask also looks great. It combines the best aspects of his original Golden Master head&nbsp;and his Legacy head to make a fantastic Overlord face&nbsp;that&nbsp;can be used for lots of cool customs.</p>

<p>My only complaint about this figure is that it&#39;s very incomplete. I can understand that they didn&#39;t want to include the four-armed version with&nbsp;a cheap magazine, but they could have at least given him an armour piece or his long horns. What we get instead is a worse version of the one included in the Crystal King set, which was already a worse version of the one in the Crystal King Temple set. I&#39;m still happy that fans have a more affordable way to get the Overlord, but he could have been much better.</p>

<p>The weapon included is a brick-built crystal sword. There is nothing&nbsp;special about it, but as I mentioned&nbsp;before, I like getting more transparent pink pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Because this is just one minifigure, there isn&#39;t anything here that&#39;s going to make for a great play experience without buying another minifigure or set. However, I think that many people who do have other sets will have a lot of fun with having the Overlord command the Crystal Warriors or other villains that they may have as well.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>While I don&#39;t normally talk about the prices of magazines&nbsp;in my reviews, this is the first one that I&#39;m reviewing since the price increase of Ninjago magazines that started with Golden Dragon Kai. Currently, (at least in Poland) these cost the same amount of money as CMFs.&nbsp;Even though I think it&#39;s still a good price for the Crystal King minifigure and the previously included Golden Dragon Ninja, this might prove to be an issue in the future with less desirable minifigures. This isn&#39;t a huge problem with this specific magazine, but I thought that it was important to mention.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Should you buy the magazine with this minifigure? Let&#39;s recap:</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great amount of detail on the minifigure</li>
	<li>Some cool and useful pieces</li>
	<li>Cheapest way to get the Crystal King</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The Minifigure is worse&nbsp;compared to the one&nbsp;included in the actual sets</li>
	<li>The paper bag peels off from the magazine way too easily</li>
	<li>The packaging spoils a reveal for people who have not yet watched the latest season</li>
</ul>

<p>As I&#39;ve stated, the minifigure representation of the Overlord&#39;s Crystal King form is fantastic. However, if you already have other sets that include more complete versions of the Crystal King, unless you want to have an extra of him, this one isn&#39;t a must-buy. If you aren&#39;t planning on buying any of the Crystalized sets that come with him and you just want&nbsp;the figure, then I certainly recommend buying this one.</p>
