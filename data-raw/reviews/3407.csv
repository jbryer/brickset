But I was interested of expanding my gas station, since the 6562 doesnt come with buildings, only a gas pump. That was why I bought this set.<br><br>In term of number of building, this gas station is better than the 6562. The set owned two building, one serving as service room while the other serve as some kind of minimarket. This set also come with lots of minifig tools that usually available in a gas station, so that's another plus for the set. <br><br>But on the negative side, I think there's a couple of things that making me not recommending this set :<br>1. The building itself is feel very plain, no detailing or anything. Just put some bricks together, and voila, you got yourself a very basic shape building.<br>2. The cars are the same. Too bulky and too simple. They dont even resemble any real cars:P<br><br>So, don't grab this set. If you need a gas station for your city, I think you better get another set. Maybe the 6562 if you like the classic city look or if you like more modern look, get the gas station from the 10184 town plan. Both of them will really look nicer for your city compared with this set.<br>",TRUE,2,2,2,3,2

<p>When looking through the catalog on Brickset I love to browse by year and set the sorting to &quot;number of pieces (desc)&quot;. If you do this you can really see how Lego has changed over the years. Mostly it&#39;s positive. Sure people always have nostalgia for sets they wanted or were lucky enough to own as a kid, but overall the quality of sets continuously improves as you go up from the early 80&#39;s to the mid 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>You start off in the 80&#39;s with some classic space sets. As you go up, there is the introduction of Castle and the iconic yellow boxes. It keeps getting better with pirates in the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s. Meanwhile, the town sets are always getting better as well. Things are getting more detailed and we&#39;re seeing some extraordinary sets such as the Airport Shuttle, the Metro Park &amp; Service Tower and the Launch &amp; Load Seaport.</p>

<p>Now to me the early to mid 90&#39;s represent the absolute pinnacle of classic Lego. I feel that Town, Castle and Pirates were all at their highest point around this time.</p>

<p>You would expect things to improve even further as you go through the catalog, but strangely this is not the case. Sets are getting more expensive, with fewer, but larger parts (this fenomenon is also called &#39;juniorisation&#39;). Some themes are only a shadow of what they used to be such as castle. Others are entirely absent.</p>

<p>What went wrong during these years? I feel like this particular set: 6548-1 Octan Gas Station shows everything that was wrong about the juniorisation of Lego. Comparing it to a similar set from around this time seems like a good way to illustrate this issue. So, let&#39;s compare it to 6397-1: Gas N&#39; Wash Express.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p>6397 was released in 1992, contains a large baseplate, 470 pieces and 3 minifigs. It apparently retailed for 52$. Now when we look at 6548-1: Octan Gas Station and compare the two it really is very obvious where the newer one falls short. Well, we get 3 minifigs, but there&#39;s only 125 pieces and we only get a very small baseplate. The price is a lot less though. Apparently this one retailed for 24$. The price per piece ratio however is way worse.</p>

<p>What is more important to me is how useful the parts really are. If you take a look at the parts - and I feel like this illustrates the problem with juniorisation perfectly - you&#39;ll see that they are all quite big and difficult to use for any other purposes. A wheel chassis, printed slopes for cars, big prefab-like bricks and some windows. Compare this to what you&#39;re getting in 6397 and you will really see why the juniorisation is such a bad move from Lego. There is just so much more you can build with those parts.</p>

<h2>Looks</h2>

<p>Looking at the set from an aesthetic point I also feel like there&#39;s no contest. The Gas N&#39; Wash Express looks like a proper gas station. You could even believe that Octan is a real-life gasoline brand. The station had multiple pumps, a roof, a repair shop / store and even a car wash. Compared to that, 6548 is a joke. The buildings look nothing like an actual gas station. In fact, if you take away the Octan logos and the carrs you might wonder what this is heap of bricks is supposed to look like.</p>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>But wait, maybe the new set has more play value at the expense of less building pleasure? Unfortunately this is again a point where 6549 falls short. Admittedly it is a lot less expensive than 6397, but you also just get a lot less to play with. Two cars, a few tools and some very basic buildings. Compared to that, 6397 has an actual road for you to drive on. There is one car and a tow truck with a functional crane. You also get a functional car wash where you can push the cars through to clean them.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think this set is not worth getting. Even if you could pick up 10 of these you would still not be able to make something nearly as nice as 6397 just because the parts are so useless!</p>

<p>1997, when this set was released, was an interesting year. 1996 still had some very good sets and then suddenly things started going downhill in 1997. There were still some very good sets around though. This was mostly because of strong themes such as Western and the excellent Divers subtheme however the cracks were clearly starting to show with worse Pirates and Castle sets and the complete annihilation of classic Town. It took a while for Lego to get to their senses and they eventually admitted that they made mistakes in those years.</p>

<p>I do feel like we are always in danger of ending up in a similar situation again. Nowadays TLG has better quality control, but sometimes stuff still gets released which has us scratching our heads. TLG also has some difficulty in keeping the prices fair. Yes, Lego has always been expensive, but that also guaranteed you were getting your money&#39;s worth. When buying a set nowadays you really have to think a bit to see if it&#39;s worth the price. And that is a red flag to me because it either means the quality has dropped or the prices are not fair anymore.</p>

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-07T19:34:18.927Z","Probably the worst Town Jr. set.","<p>I grew up with the Town Jr. range of sets when I was a kid and had most of them. I recently found a box with a ton of them in my attic and figured I&#39;d review some of my childhood toys for the benefit of any collectors out there thinking of picking any of them up.</p>

<p>Honestly, this set is probably the worst of the bunch. For all of Town Jr.&#39;s faults, of which there are many, the items portrayed in the sets usually actually look like what they&#39;re supposed to, which can just barely be said about this set. It&#39;s in five parts so I figure I may as well review each part individually:</p>

<p><strong>1. The car:</strong> The car is, no joke, seven pieces and some tires. It doesn&#39;t look very much like a car and is unfortunate that TLC re-used this car design in several of the 1997 town sets. I remember as a kid really liking the chassis for these sorts of cars, maybe I just wasn&#39;t very creative but I&#39;d always have a hard time building one myself so it never really bothered me that the chassis was one piece. The thing that bothered me was how poor the pieces on top of it were. No roof, no windshield, no really anything that suggests this thing is a car and sadly it is not the last time we&#39;ll see a car like this in the 1997 town lineup.</p>

<p><strong>2. The tow truck:</strong> The tow truck is also, a running theme in this set, probably the worst tow truck they made for the 1997 lineup (the tow-n-go value pack being among the better ones, though still a poor show). No roof as usual, no back as usual, and a crane arm that would&#39;ve been much easier to play with and more realistic if they just gave it a string wench system like they do most other tow trucks instead of the static crane arm that it has. The chain is a plus, as you can *never* have too many chains in your lego collection, but much like pretty much everything else in this set it needs a huge overhaul to look anything like a tow truck. You basically have to make it do a wheelie in order to have the hook actually attach to anything.</p>

<p><strong>3. The gas pump:</strong> It&#39;s a sad state of affairs to say that this is the best part about the set, but it is. It&#39;s not like a gas pump&#39;s anything to get all excited about but at least the thing actually looks sort of like a gas pump and has hoses and consoles. I don&#39;t really like the massive &quot;three 2x2 bricks as one brick&quot; assembly it uses but that&#39;s pretty much par for the course in this era for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>4. The convenience store: </strong>This part is terrible, mostly because there is absolutely nothing in it. To see a convenience store done right, see the shell select shop promotional set, that thing actually looks like a convenience store and has things in it that people can buy. This has a computer console acting as a register and that&#39;s it. The lack of a back to the building doesn&#39;t bother me (how else you gonna play with the thing) but the lack of much of anything in the building does. It&#39;s a really blocky building that&#39;s, and I&#39;m being generous here, made of 40 parts maximum, and outside of it is some stuff I guess you&#39;d use to wash a car. All in all you basically can just use this building for parts to make a better building.</p>

<p><strong>5. The mechanic&#39;s shop:</strong> Again, extremely boxy, extremely low-detail, basically a cube with no walls you can drive very small cars into... And that&#39;s about it. Your standard lego tool rack that shows up in every set, a fire extinguisher (yellow?) that&#39;s kinda neat, one of those cool little blue jack pieces that are rare, and an octan mailbox that is honestly probably the best part of the set just because of how rare it is. This may be the other best part of the set because with little effort you can make it resemble an actual garage, though it still has basically no walls and is little more than a shed.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience: </strong>There isn&#39;t really much of one. You can build the whole thing in five minutes and take it apart in half the time. The instructions are in five sheets like all sets from that era, making it much easier to lose them, so I&#39;m glad they got away from that strategy for the most part. The instructions don&#39;t have any obvious flaws and are easy to follow, though.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>This is about the only plus to this set. There&#39;s a lot of good and fairly rare parts here, like the jack, the mailbox, and mostly the insane quantity of Octan-branded bricks, something I always loved as a kid, slapping those all over everything. Same with the Octan flags, this is probably the best source for Octan-branded elements you can find. Most of the bricks are bog-standard but what&#39;s rare is very rare, such as the enormous amount of octan bricks, the jack, the mailbox, the brush, and even the civilian minifigure torso.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Now do keep in mind as I write this I&#39;m a crabby old twenty-something man, so playing with a lego set isn&#39;t really something I&#39;m all that into these days. That said I do remember having some fun with this as a kid, but it was entirely after rebuilding pretty much everything in the set. The gas pump I kept off to the side and used as a little gas pump in my lego city I built for a long time, but the other buildings got upgraded and modified over the years because they&#39;re barely frames. So when rating the playability, obviously since it&#39;s a lego set it&#39;s quite high, because you can simply re-work the set to make it more playable. However, as the set stands when you buy it out of the box, it&#39;s pretty poor. There just isn&#39;t much here and virtually every other gas station set ever released is better made than this.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>I have no idea how much my parents bought this set for for me, but I can tell you that on bricklink this set routinely goes for thirty to forty dollars and isn&#39;t a particularly easy set to find at all, only ever having eight or nine listings maximum. As with a lot of these older lego sets, most sellers are selling it from the Netherlands, with all the shipping costs and import wait-times that come with that if you&#39;re an American like myself. This is to say the value for your money is quite poor with this set. If you can find it you&#39;re probably better off just saving your money, and that&#39;s coming from a guy who is a huge collector of things. This just isn&#39;t worth collecting. Get the Roadside Repair set instead, it&#39;s cheaper and a lot more detailed and fun.</p>
