VEHICLES
There is a police car, a truck with metallic smoke chimneys, and best of all, a 4X4 vehicle with suspension wheels - a rarity in Lego sets. There is also a simple helicopter but comes in useful when you are making MOCs. Very good selection of vehicles and parts!

BASE
With two awesome roadplates, this set also has other details such as a telephone booth, fences, trees, flowers, a handful of road signs, and police barricades. The road signs are a nice touch.

VERDICT
This set is complete by itself, with just the presence of a building. 1 helicopter, 2 roadplates, 3 cars, 4 minifigs, and a crazy handful of other accessories, I recommend this set to anyone who wants the bang for the buck.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

If you already have a Lego town with a few roadways and baseplates, getting this (very large!) add-on to it is very recommended. On its own it&#39;s fine too for what it is, but the staggering amount of rare accessories included make it better as an expansion pack.</p>

<p>This set includes two civilian vehicles, one police car, and one of the whopping four police helicopters released in the late nineties Town Jr. lineup. It also, honestly more interestingly, includes two road printed baseplates with an enormous amount of roadside accessories. This set is just begging to be combined with a construction crew set, or a fire department set, or a gas station set, to make some truly excellent settings and scenes for your Lego town. As is Lego&#39;s tradition of the time, the set is divided into different instruction manuals so I&#39;ll review each part separately.</p>

<p><strong>The Helicopter: </strong>If you&#39;re a collector of Town Jr., you have a whole lot of police helicopters. This one is somewhere right in the middle. A surprisingly small amount of prefabricated pieces for the time period are present here, with the skids actually being made up of six different pieces instead of that ugly huge prefab &quot;sled&quot; brick. The printed police blocks on the side are a nice touch, but the big problem with this part is just how generic it is. There&#39;s nothing real good or bad about this helicopter, it&#39;s just sort of there, among the massive amount of other police helicopters from the era. It has no real interesting details barring the printed pieces.</p>

<p><strong>The Police Car: </strong>It&#39;s basically the Race &amp; Chase set&#39;s police car but slightly different. It&#39;s yet another convertible of the thousands released in the nineties, but this time it has a neat kind of pickup bed in the back where you can stash all the minifig accessories that come with it (a radio, megaphone, and a police paddle stop sign thing in this case). The parts with the word &quot;POLICE&quot; on them are all printed, so that&#39;s pretty cool, and the pair of police roadblocks included with it are sure to provide hours of fun to a kid that wants to drive a car through them over and over. The little console included to track speed is a neat touch. Interesting choice of TLC to design a set around the concept of pulling over speeders. I suppose when you&#39;re a kid and haven&#39;t had it happen to you yet the whole process seems more exciting than annoying as it becomes later in life.</p>

<p><strong>The 4WD car: </strong>This one is the only one included with a roof, naturally. The chrome exhaust pipes look really cool and the whole thing looks like an awesome heavy-duty off road vehicle like one that was included in the old &quot;Outback&quot; theme. The side panels read &quot;4WD&quot; and the front has a neat printed tile piece with a picture of a buffalo on it (for some reason) and the whole thing looks pretty cool. My only complaint is that I wish it came with the springy axle bricks like the other civilian vehicle in this set does, though you can easily swap them out if need be.</p>

<p><strong>The Hot Car: </strong>It has two printed bricks on the sides that read &quot;HOT CAR&quot;, which is a... interesting thing to put on a vehicle, to say the least. The double exhaust pipes in the front of the car look pretty neat, but other than that this is as generic as vehicle design in the late 90&#39;s could get. It&#39;s not even streamlined in the front, it&#39;s just a rectangle with no roof and a windshield. Something I will say I like about this set is that Lego didn&#39;t really distinguish either of the two civilian cars included as the &quot;bad guy&quot; like they do sometimes, making one minifig or another have stripey prison uniforms to distinguish that they&#39;re the one the police are looking for. Huh.</p>

<p><strong>The Baseplate: </strong>Honestly this is why you should get this set, if you&#39;re going to get it at all. Two of the lovely late nineties road plates, one T shaped and one straight, with a TON of accessories to decorate them with. Included are: three flowers, two large trees, two small trees, a VERY cool looking and VERY rare phone booth, four large scale yellow fences, a bush, and a whopping five of the old-time 2x1 base sign bricks that were largely phased out by this point. These bricks themselves alone regularly sell for four-five dollars if not more on bricklink and you get a bounty of them with this set, which is almost worth the price of admission alone.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Where the late 90&#39;s sets sadly always falter, and this is no exception. You don&#39;t really build it so much as you just stack the bare minimum of pieces on top of pre-fabricated chassis. When I was a kid and didn&#39;t know any better this didn&#39;t bother me but as an adult it just seems unforgivably lazy. The best part of the building experience is building the phone booth, which honestly does have a very attractive and interesting design... and isn&#39;t included anywhere in any of the four instruction booklets how to build! Not a big deal when you&#39;re 20-something putting it together, but I can imagine a kid not managing to make it look like the picture. Very odd they didn&#39;t so much as mention its existence in any of the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Now we&#39;re talking. Whole lot of extremely rare or extremely valuable or even exclusive pieces on offer here. Printed pieces for days... Say what you want about the sad state of most Town Jr. sets, but no stickers to worry about, almost ever. You get four 1x6 &quot;POLICE&quot; printed white bricks, five of the extremely rare old-time sign bricks, the telephone booth printed slope brick that&#39;s in this and maybe four other sets, ever. You get a bunch of printed tiles and bricks on the civilian vehicles that are exclusives to this set (admittedly of varying degrees of usefulness... I have no idea what application a 1x8 brick with &quot;HOT CAR&quot; printed on the side of it would have in a MOC...), a ton of plants (can never have too many!), a ton of flowers, the old-time fence bricks you don&#39;t see much, the speedometer printed slope brick (which is written in km/h... my preteen self had no idea what that meant at the time), printed &quot;POLICE&quot; headgear for the minifigs, the list goes on. And of course the pair of printed baseplates which are like gold for any Town collectors out there. All in all even though most of the vehicles are uninspired, the parts alone make this set worth picking up.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>It&#39;s a pair of police vehicles and a pair of civilian cars for them to hassle. Of course it has high playability for a kid! You can crash through the barriers, go on wild police chases, have people call the cops on the pay phone, all sorts of stuff. Displayability is quite high too, you can make all sorts of neat looking scenes with the civilian cars alone, let alone the police ones.</p>

<p><strong>Value For The Money: </strong>Depends. Are you wanting to use it to expand a city? It&#39;s absolutely worth the 40 bucks it normally commands in that case. Are you wanting it for a bunch of rare parts? Honestly the baseplates and the plants and signs are worth about that much a-la carte, so the rest is just gravy at that point. Are you wanting to use it to build the included models? Eh... You could do worse, but at 40+ dollars there are a ton better police sets out there.</p>

<p>In other words, you probably already know if this is the set for you. Do you like rare Town Jr. parts? If you do this is great. If not, it&#39;s way overpriced.</p>
