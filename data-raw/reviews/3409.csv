"CyandraZ","2008-03-16T16:05:01.217Z","Kinda boring.","Another run of the mill racer that I own. The design is really quite plain, and a bit too bulky if you ask me. The driver is also really boring – I have so many blue Octan mechanics that I’m really tired of them. 

Honestly, this set is really nothing special at all, although it does have some green plates and a rare 1x4 green tile. It’s not bad, but it’s not really that good either, so I can’t really recommend it unless you are a serious collector and can find it new in the box. 5/10

I loved the hunky four spotlights on the front and the opening roof and also this was my first vehicle doors. This was top back then and even until now I think that the design of this Outback Racer is very original. I suppose this set was made as part of the unofficial 'Octan' series.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-22T11:38:56.91Z","LEGO Town (Vehicles) - Outback Racer Review","<p>This is a nice little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 49 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio was 8 cents per piece which is really worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The driver has a blue overall, a white helmet and a black visor. The figure looks very cool, too.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6550-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This vehicle may doesn't do much but it's still very easy to maneuver. The doors on each side can be opened very easily and you can also open the top. The design of this car looks very amazing and I also like the colors which LEGO has chosen for this model.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2011-01-13T08:19:38.043Z","A good little car, very few defects","<p>I got this set as part of a neighbor's collection. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions have a simple display. It's not amazing, incredible, or notable. They've done better with that.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set has quite a few good parts. There is a green 1x4 tile, a 3x2 slope with ""wheel hubs"", a 3x4 yellow hinge plate (with 1x4 yellow hinge plate), 2 yellow doors, and a few other parts. Unfortunately, they use stickers. Fortunately, the stickers have much better sticking power than today.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The set includes on minifigure. It's simple, as was the rest of LEGO town back then. The minifigure has a smile and eyebrows, and wears an octan suit. Octan sure has lots of money, since it's sponsoring loads of things.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It isn't complex-sadly. Mostly just stacking bricks, with a little SNOT.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The green works out perfectly. It makes a line of color and fits with the stickers. The yellow also works well. The entire shape is aesthetically pleasing, and the fact that it fits a minifigure without requiring that you remove a hat/hairpiece (like with 2010's Small Car), I'd say it's a good vehicle.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Why get this set? Why not get this set? If you can find a complete one less than 6 dollars, I'd consider it a very good deal. The minifigure certainly isn't worth much, but the vehicle is nice. So are the parts.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
