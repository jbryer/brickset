<p><strong>Main build:</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to say what is my build here. Racing infrastructure or cars? Let&#39;s say both. So, we base plate with part of the race track (starting part to be exact) and grass on both sides. The construction on one side of the track is very simple and easy to build. It has a place for fans on the roof (without stairs, though) and some race utilities. Not very much, but overall it works. The cars are two buggies. One comes with black and red, and one in white and blue. I really like their build. Especially the amortized suspension is a very neat feature. When I was a kid I&#39;ve played a lot only with just bouncing these cars :D I also very like the design of the openable windscreen.</p>

<p>As for drawbacks, I would say that it would be the lack of some gastronomy element in this set. A small food stand would be enough. And though we have six Minifigures excluding the race service ones we get only two &#39;neutral&#39; Minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Accessories:</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve got a bunch of standard accessories for this type of set. A bar with just hammer and rench, two fire extinguishers, small Octan fuel tank and a jack (yay, I&#39;ve learned a new word today). Nothing particulary special, not too bad either. Standard content. I think Lego could fit here some shelf or hanger with backup wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>So we&#39;ve got 6 minifigures here. That&#39;s nice, especially as this set is not too big itself. Hovewer, as I&#39;ve mentioned before. It could still have one fan minifigure more, or a food seller maybe. We&#39;ve got two fans. One male and one female. Given the fact, that they both are wearing tanktops and the Man is waering sunglasses we can assume that the race is placed in some warm place and time of year which is great. We&#39;ve got also two racers, one technican (I&#39;ve loved the zipper jacket from those minifigures as a Kid. Unfortunately I lost them both) and of course one minifigure with formal outfit to start the race. Overall I think that this is a good set of minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Verditct:</strong></p>

<p>I like this set as a whole. It has two cars, so two Kids can play with it simultaniously. Bright, vibrant colors, colorful flags and bunch of minifigures give this set a nice festival vibe. However, the build is very simple, and the cars are basically the same so building experience in this set is not very exciting, so it could be a drawback for some people.</p>
