Whenever one (or a few) of your Lego town people need a vacation, this is the place to go. There are a ton of things to do with this set. I particularly love how the cabin is built into the little mountain. There is a cool bridge that passes over the river (also makes a good fishing spot). There is a very nice utility truck with trailer included in the set, as well as a little sport boat. The cabin is not very big, but it is suitable. If you can find this, add this to your town. Your residents will thank you! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dunx125","2007-12-17T08:54:42.187Z","Brings back great memories... An absolute classic","One of my favourite sets. It has great pieces, with the river building board, the bridge, trees, bushes, windows and doors. It was a fun build, with lots of different components. My favourite part was the truck that tows the boat, which not only had great pieces, but also had a cool little fisherman. 
On the whole, a must have set. Lots of character, rare pieces and fun! What more could a Lego fan ask for?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"DJimBo","2009-04-11T11:14:41.747Z","A great piece of old lego art","This is just one of those great old set's. small but great to play with.

Pros:
- river plate
- towbridge
- old lego vehicles(nice lego format, not those huge vehicles of now)
- nice diorama

cons:
- not avalable on lego anymore... =(
- the house is cooler from the outside than the inside.

overall it's just a very nice set, I would not buy it if you are building a city but it's just great for an adventure world.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-22T04:40:02.713Z","LEGO Town (Leisure) - Rocky River Retreat Review","This set is a great set to have in any LEGO collection. It has some great stuff and it's fun to play with. It's an easy build and very sturdy as well. We get a boat, a jeep with a trailer and a cabin. I also love the design which LEGO used for the baseplate. The engine of the boat does sviwel and the ceiling of the jeep can be opened. The trunk can be opened as well and the trailer can be attached to this vehicle very easily.<br><br>The cabin is the coolest part of this set. The ceiling is printed and the door and windows can be opened. We also get some cool stuff in the inside like a barrel and a bed.

"ledaKat","2009-10-23T20:28:08.827Z","Quintessential America","This is my new favourite lego set ever. It arrived early this morning and I immediatly got to work building it.

Nothing about this cozy little scene bares any resemblance to my own native New Zealand (that tiny but beautiful little country at the bottom of the world). Our holiday homes, or ""bach"" as they are called here, are typically at the beach.  As a kid of the 80s I grew up on those wonderful old school American movies and tv programmes and this reminds me so much of a studio ""outdoor"" set from an old sit-com. I half expect to see a bear leaning over the river catching salmon and a racoon hiding in the trees.

I got so excited as I was building it and realised the cabin actually went into the rock! And creates a huge second room, so I added a little bed and sofa and lantern in there out of spare parts.

The truck is a supurb example of the vehicles of this era. It has two small windows in the back and the whole back door lifts up. I especially like the fishing rod and the flash beam lights on the roof.  It has a simple trailer to transport the little boat. Its basic but totally practical and effective.

The minifigs are nothing special (although I do really adore the lady's cowboy hat) but they work well with the overall charm of the set.  I greatly admire the simplicity of the trunks of the pine trees, just your basic shutter bricks stuck on top of each other with their little tabs resembling bark. You are completely free to build them whatever height you wish and place them wherever in the scene you feel they should go.

On the whole, it is a brilliant set and I want to go there and fish and look for gold in the river and sleep in the room under the rocky mountain... oh i need a holiday!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"James83","2013-01-04T06:19:09.953Z","An Adventure Holiday","<p>In the late 1980s Lego Town had a few holiday sets, mainly caravans and European-style chalets. In 1993 Lego released one of the first rugged activity holiday sets and set the style for future sets using mountain pieces other than Pirate and Castle sets. Not only that but this set comes with an array of parts and has some of those usual orginal design features.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Building</strong></p><p>The buildings are in three parts, a cabin, a mountain and a rope bridge.</p><p>The baseplate was bespoke and looks great with its stepping stones and running water effect. It's a great basis for this set but you might find you struggle to make use of it fully if you break this set up later. The picket fence doesn't really fit well and the two grey sloped bricks at the far left hand side represent rocks but don't really work well either. The evergreen trees made from brown window hinges look great though and are really ingenious. I re-used those countless times. I had a few spare reed peices and added those too. </p><p>The cabin is a little gem. I love the stone roof, the little shuttered windows and the way the edge of the cabin with its jagged edge mimics that of those wooden cabins you see in Westerns. The white window ledge works well too, the yellow door is basic but it fits too despite its garish colour. Inside you don't get much. One blue seat, a basic 2x2 block desk with lantern and a thin 2x bed, which you can't really use due to narrow space. There is a barrel with a broom and chainsaw in the base of the mountain which doubles as a storage room, with probably as much room as the cabin has. The right wall is a grey wall and window brick which fits into the mountain nicely. There is ample room for all kinds of own-additions and improvements in there.</p><p>The rope bridge has a sturdy anchor at one end with a ladder and the other end clips onto the mountain itself, which has a little ledge. The bridge looks great on this set. My only concern is that it leads nowhere. To access the cabin the minifigure has to climb down the mountain side! Even though the mountain is out of scale with everything else, it does look good and certainly adds that rugged outdoors feel to the whole set and, as mentioned above, the base doubles as an extra room inside.</p><p>Outside is a neat water pump which is well-designed and looks good. There is a barrel outside and across the river a small camping stove/ fire with a frying pan. The use of a hook brick as a fish is just pure genius. I immediately added another dozen to this set! Two mugs are also included as is a metal detector (previously a Space piece) and a blue brick as some kind of 'find'.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicles</strong></p><p>The yellow 4x4 is a typical Town vehicle, being much like the earlier Set 6643 Fire Chief's Truck of the 1980s. It featured some more modern features though, a ridged vent brick to better&nbsp;represent a radiator (which had different patterns on each side for variety), a flat 2x2 bonnet brick, roof lights, side clips for a pick-axe and fishing rod, chunky wheels, tow-bar clip and a tailgate with a window and tail lights. The whole vehicle is sturdy and looks great with its yellow and red colour scheme. </p><p>The trailer is pretty basic&nbsp;but works well, it has a single stud brick to attach to the boat.</p><p>The boat is a fairly typical design of the period but has the neat feature of having two seperate seating areas for the occupants. The driver has a steering wheel as well. It also has&nbsp;a hinged outboard motor and a carpet stud for easier ""sailing"", which most boats did without. One fault is the inclusion of only one lifejacket, a pity when so much other stuff is included and when the boat can seat two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>The male has blue jeans, green jacket and red cap and the face has blue sunglasses stuble. This figure became widespread around this time. The female has white trousers, a rare blue jacket and a grey cowboy hat. Luggage includes a backpack and a suitcase. A horse is included with saddle and a grey bird, which is more commonly the red Pirate parrot. Althoigh meant to be an eagle, it looks like&nbsp;a parrot still but is a nice touch. These adventures have stacks of kit, chainsaws, fishing rods etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>This set was highly orginial and offers a lot of pieces. There isn't much else that could have been included, although another lifejacket would have been good. The jeep and boat and well designed too and add some rugged feeling and the basic cabin and mountain is about as original as can be. Sure there are flaws inside but there's so much outdoor stuff to do that it doesn't really matter. It uses a nice combination of Space, Pirate, Castle and Town parts to make something that is very unique and it's obvious the designers put a lot of though into all of the various elements that make up this set, even down to the fish and a&nbsp;bird! If you can get hold of this set it offers something different to most other sets and is just as playable today as it was twenty years ago!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

"plexiglass","2014-08-15T04:46:44.69Z","Lovely set","<p>These are the types of sets that I like- full of diverse pieces, uncomplicated, and endless possibilities of fun.</p>

<p>You have a house, people, a horse even, a boat, a car, and a mountain! What else could you want?</p>

<p>The baseplate is unique and it has many uses, especially for more &quot;outdoors&quot; type builds.</p>

<p>This is is really about playing and letting your imagination run free- creating your own adventure.</p>

<p>The house isn&#39;t much but it&#39;s there, if you have other pieces from another set you can spruce it up a little. Nobody says that you have to enjoy the set with only what came in the box. The cobblestone type roof is unique and a nice touch.</p>

"Ganymedes1985","2021-11-13T15:55:22.34Z","Look at those pine trees!","<p>Lego System set 6552, commonly known as the &quot;Rocky River Retreat&quot;, from 1993.</p>

<p>Alliteration apparently was a thing back then when naming a set, regardless of their size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the US and Canadian markets this set was rebranded as the &quot;Canadian Mountain Camp&quot;, and I see why Lego would want to reference something closer to home for those markets, as rocky forests are hardly exclusive to Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set came with a unique base plate depicting a fast flowing river with a narrow island in the middle, a unique female minifigure,&nbsp;two somewhat rare printed &quot;slate roof&quot; slopes and (for the time) the fairly new rope suspension bridge.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about how imaginative they used bricks to resemble things they clearly weren&#39;t conceptualized for back in the 1990s, but one of the things I love most about this set, back then and today, is the use of brown shutter holders to resemble those tall and knotty trunks you see in pine forests.&nbsp;<br />
The thing I remember doing most with this set was taking the trees and mountain components out of it and incorporating them in other sets.</p>

<p>Both the Jeep and the boat feel like they&#39;re the proper size for minifigures, and although I&#39;m not the biggest fan of yellow, they contrast brilliantly with the grey, green and brown color palette that dominate the rest of the set.<br />
I imagine that, in real life, when you&#39;re out in the forest and something goes wrong, you&#39;d want to be noticeable, right?</p>

<p>Aside from the Jeep and boat, this set mostly focused on being an outdoor diorama.</p>

<p>You have a small campfire to cook on, some accessories like a metal detector, a broom, a life vest for the boat, a manual water pump and water barrel, and most importantly: a fishing rod, to catch some red salmon that you cook in the pan. This was before Lego would actually make a fish shaped accessory, so you&#39;d have to imagine a red vertical clip was the salmon.</p>

<p>The inside of the &quot;retreat&quot; is, unfortunately, a rather spartan cabin with just a blue bed, table, chair and what I always assumed is supposed to resemble a miners lamp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right next to the cabin there&#39;s the mountain, and if we turn the diorama around you can see that the interior of the mountain is, in fact, an extension to the cabin, there&#39;s even a tool in there to help you find gems, (this was before Lego made actually gem-shaped bricks, although those would follow very soon).</p>

<p>I also tried 1 of the alternative &quot;suggested builds&quot; that were on the back of the box, and frankly I actually prefer how in one of those the cabin sits above the river, compared to the &quot;official&quot; build.</p>

<p>In conclusion, when I was 8 this set was brilliant as it offered a more adventurous setting compared to more mainstream &quot;real life&quot; urban builds life fire stations and construction machines.</p>
