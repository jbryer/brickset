"CyandraZ","2008-03-16T16:06:21.59Z","Wonderful set.","Even though the current City line is turning out great, the one thing I miss about the old town line is the extreme diversity in subjects. From parking garages to trailer campers to riding stables, the classic town line took full advantage of the vast array of possibilities, turning out different subjects each year.

This quaint kit is a great example of that quality. The premise is simple: a news crew equipped with all the gear they need to tackle tough stories, and is executed so flawlessly in this wonderful kit.

Starting off, the news van is small but has a great design and neat details like a folding TV dish and opening trunk. Then there’s the copter, which is quite a work of art. The neat construction for the tail, skids, and lights accompany the bulky body perfectly, and the bench outside the copter for the cameraman to sit is just awesome.

Another great quality is the diversity of pieces in this kit.  Rare pieces like the blue hinge box, the white brick with a pin in the top, and the printed nose of the helicopter add spice to the standard selection of bricks plates, and hinges. Sadly, this kit has stickers, and while I normally don’t mind them, in this kit they overlap bricks if placed in the standard position. Disappointing, but the stickers themselves are really cool, if a bit simple.

Of course, without minifigs and accessories, a town kit really isn’t that fun, and this kit has plenty of both. Included are two camera men, a reporter lady with a wonderful torso, and plenty of news equipment like two different cameras, a spotlight, a microphone, a megaphone, and even an extra tape for the camera! All this great stuff makes the kit chock full of playability, especially when added to other town kits.

Overall, this kit is just wonderful. Aside from the overlapping stickers, there really is nothing to complain about, and there is plenty to praise. If you can get it for a good price online, I strongly suggest you equip your town with this top notch news crew. 10/10

"EL_Mo","2008-06-09T10:27:47.467Z","Crisis News Crew","  This is pretty nice set.  It comes with a van, helicopter, minifigs, and tons of accessories.  Onto pros and cons:

Pros:
+You can shove all the tools in the back of the van.
+The roofs of the vehicles are hinged for easy escape.
+This is one of the more realistic helicopters lego has made.
+Very nice accessories.

Cons:
-I honestly don't think that a news woman would be wearing that get-up.
-Pilot of the helicopter doesn't fit in that well.
-Guy on the outside of helicopter is kinda stupid.
-useless sattelite on the van.

Overall, the reason this is a three is because, though this is a cool set, there are many flaws.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2010-09-29T23:26:10.017Z","A Really Cool Set","I got this set as part of a large collection of (relatively) complete sets from a neighbor free, and all of them were old. So building and figuring out what they were was a ""journey"" of discovery.<br><br>Growing up, I had always wanted a TV LEGO set. I had not known about this, having been made a few years prior to my birth. However, I had seen this set a few times in 2009/2010 while researching for Brickipedia, and really wanted it. Sadly, there are no other similar sets (this is part of the outback theme, though it's a mystery why-among Town sets it's unique). So when I found a lot of TV parts in the bags, I was very, very happy.<br><br><h4>Parts</h4>This set has awesome parts. For starters, you get a lot of basic transparent parts, a few camera reels (really useful), a TV mic piece, a TV chopper front, and much more. Some non-printed parts that are useful include the rooves, the panels, and most of the other parts in this set. The only issue I have with it is stickers, which there are four of. Two I have little problem with, them being on the large panels on the truck. The other two however, overlap with other parts, meaning you have to remove the stickers to use them for anything else. Unfortunately, the one I got didn't have stickers still.<br><h4>Building Experience</h4>There's not too much to say about building this set, though it was very different from any set I had built before. It was not challenging, but the helicopter technique was very nice. The van was decent, but the coolest of all were the little details, which are simple but good looking.<br><h4>Appearance and Playability<br></h4>The set rock on the outside and the inside. The helicopter look spectacular, the van looks good, and the colors are great. The TV logos also fit in perfectly. As for playability, this set is great. It's got all of the things to do a newshoot-a movie truck, a movie copter, a camera (with stand, angles up and down), a light, a mic, and more. The extras all fit into the van (except the light, which is too tall), but unfortunately the part used in between the person and the storage allows for parts to come through. The two male minifigures' torsos look great, and the female's torso is pretty good too. There's not really anything bad, although the dish on the van can be a bit awkward, and the helicopter's little platform is odd when not in use.<br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Great Colors</li><li>The only set with TV parts</li><li>Lots of camera reels</li><li>Great design</li><li>Good figures</li><li>Great price</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Only TV set made</li><li>The dish is both good and bad at the same time</li><li>Helicopter ""platform"" odd when a minifigure is not sitting on it</li></ul><h4>Recommendations</h4>I recommend this great set to anyone and everyone who likes Town, and anyone who is looking for some cool parts, a TV crew, or just a nice set (that's cheap). I'll probably buy another sometime soon.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Jomeco","2012-08-20T21:18:13.773Z","Great set, but has some obvious flaws.","<p>This model is great, it comes with everything you could imagine that a news crew could come with. A cool blue van with two TV stickers and an antenna (a&nbsp;reminisce&nbsp;of the LEGO 6661 van), the detailed helicopter including a piece showing the controls, three minifigures with the TV logo printed on their torsos, the two nicely designed cameras (one that can move up and down—the other for the minifigure on the edge ""seat"" of the helicopter), the light stand, and the microphone (a cool detailed piece also with the TV logo printed.) It's very detailed.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A lot of accessories, some can be used as replacements.</li><li>Diverse set, comes with a van and helicopter.</li><li>Three rare minifigures with the TV logo print.</li><li>Easy to fit in the minifigure inside of the van.</li><li>Nice microphone with female news anchor.</li><li>A set full of many details.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Minifigure does not look right almost hanging off of the helicopter.</li><li>The back of the van does not have a window.</li><li>The satellite dish can only move up and down.</li><li>The helicopter's gray bottom landing piece falls off sometimes.</li></ul>
<p>Comparing this set to the similar 1989 LEGO 6661 set (which is also a TV set), they both have their own pros and cons independently. I would recommend this set to any LEGO enthusiast who is looking for some detail and live action in their expanding city or town. Overall, I give this set a four out of five.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
