Be warned, though, it says 6+ on the box, but there is no six year old I know who could figure out this game with the instructions provided.  Key items are not mentioned (i.e. an explanation of &quot;safe&quot; status), they are inconsistent with what is provided in the box (i.e. only 2 &quot;X-tra&quot; cards are provided to each player, not the three indicated), and they are not clear (i.e. the &quot;push&quot; card does not clearly indicate how you are allowed to move the unit).  Another gripe is that if a beginner follows the rules in the order listed, you spend a good amount of time setting up your pieces on the inventory sheet, only to find out that you need to turn over the inventory sheet to learn which units to build first.

The Lego website at www.LEGO.com/x-pod provides more detailed instructions and answers to frequently asked questions - if you get this game, go to the website first. Now that I have better instructions, and assuming my son will want to give it another try, I'll write again and let you know how it goes.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
