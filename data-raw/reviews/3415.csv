There are so many better firestations in the history of lego, yet I am stuck with this for now. But, I was a kid when I got Blaze Brigade, so my parents are not at fault for buying it for me. 

No, it’s TLC”s fault for designing Blaze Brigade in the first place. Why? Well, let’s take a look at the components, starting with the vehicles:

Fire Car: Okay, so this is not so bad. The design is okay, I guess. But, it’s not good either. Just blah.

Fire Copter: Not a half bad copter, except for one thing. Aside from the markings on the sides, nothing really makes it look like a fire copter at all. It could be a rescue copter, for all that we know! What is it for, anyway? Reconnaissance? After all, it has no water cannons. &gt;_&gt;

Fire Truck: Terrible. Just terrible. Firstly, since when are fire trucks the same size as fire cars? This… thing, is WAY too small. Everything is so crammed together on it! Second, I’ve never seen a modern fire truck with an open roof. Third, the chassis is incredibly juniorized. Ick, it’s all one piece! Finally, well, just look at it! It’s a mess, and totally unrealistic.

Now onto the fire station itself:

Center Building: Uh, what were they thinking when the designers designed this? Why does it have a mailbox out in the front anyway? And why are there no doors, just a large open space? Man, the poor firefighters must have to pay a fortune in carpet bills when it rains. Oh, wait, the floor is grass! &gt;_&lt;  How about the interior? The control center on floor 2 is okay, with only two computers and a lever. No map of the city, though. Floor 1 has another computer (which is sticking out the front opening), and a cooler with cups. Okay, why do these firefighters need a cooler? What about beds?

Right Building: Um, tools and fire extinguishers don’t belong out in the open. Somebody could just take them when the fire fighters weren’t looking. Helicopter pad’s okay, but I can’t see how anybody can get to it. Or get down from it, for that matter.

Left Building: I’m still trying to figure out what this is for. Extra long range cable TV antenna? And why are the oxygen tanks way out in the open? It’s like these fire fighters are inviting minifigs to steal their equipment!

Yes, other problems still loom. Why are there no sheds for the vehicles, just spaces between the ridiculous buildings for them to park? Why are there fences on the lawn when they serve no purpose? Ugh, so many problems with this kit!

Piecewise, this kit is OKAY. Lots of firemen accessories, like fire extinguishers, axes, megaphones, oxygen tanks, and a breathing mask. The flowers, tree, fences, and mailbox would be good for other places around town. And the windows and walls are useful. But overall, nothing too special is included.

Minifigures? Again, okay. You get a fire chief, two firefighters, and a pilot that doesn’t look like he belongs in a FIRE chopper. 

But, as you can tell, I am NOT fond of this set. Hardly. To me, this is one of the worst sets ever made. A complete disgrace to town lego, with junoirized design and tons of pointless or outrageous details. Do yourself a favor, and completely avoid this set, or you will be disappointed to no avail. 2/10.

"StormSworder","2008-03-08T15:38:14.59Z","90's dumbing down.","To think that the Lego company, who once produced classic Fire Stations such as 6382 and 6385 was reduced to this by the late 1990s.  What's wrong with this set?  It would be quicker to go over what's right with it.  So here goes - there are a lot of useful little pieces such as equipment.  There, that didn't take long.  Anyway, now onto what's wrong with it.  The vehicles are strictly average.  Neither the car or the fire engine feature hinged doors or roofs, and the helicopter is far too simple in construction.  But the chief offender is the station itself.  There is more or less no possibility for alternative building.  Instead of walls made of individual bricks there are giant slabs.  There are bridges which serve no apparent function, everything is out in the open and there are no garages.  There aren't even any doors!  Didn't the designers think children could work out the physics of a hinged door?  That would explain the ground vehicles.  Like I said, there are useful little pieces such as equipment, computers, chairs, etc, but even as a 5-year-old I'd have felt insulted at anything as dumbed-down as this.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Hewkii1992","2008-08-23T22:07:25.89Z","A blazing failure.","This was my first fire station that I acquired around the age of five.  Today, it lays in pieces scattered in the many LEGO bins I have, and I wonder why.

At the time, I can't say I hated this set, it was my first and only fire station I have gotten.  I do remember it having a lot of play features, and I did not notice the juniorization, for I grew up with it during the late 90's, unfortunately.  Judging by the look of the station nowadays, I notice many flaws with the station, all making it completely unrealistic.  Look at the packaging art, it has two cityscapes placed at uneven horizons for crying out loud.  The station itself seems flimsy, and the trucks are overly juniorized, and I fail to recognize the 'car' as being a car.  They do not sport roofs, and the grills are printed.

Given the fact that this set is meant for children coming out of duplo is reasonable, but it baffles me to why TLG decided to dedicate a whole city line to children.  They have realized their mistakes, however, and they now have a separate theme for juniors.  For the targeted age group, as I can remember, this was a fair set which became a little boring rather quickly.  As I cannot really review the set, I do know for a fact that the package art is better than the official model, so you may have to be dependent on that.

It is really cool &amp; in 3 sections with a helicopter pad. I prefer the old cars with doors &amp; lights. They are a lot bigger &amp; more detailed. But if the cars were changed then this set would be amazing. A lot better in my oppinion. But yet i still gave this set a 5. I like all the accesories, like the axe, oxygen tanks, chain saw &amp; the oxygen mask. i like the mini helicopter but i think it should have been red not yellow. 

All in all a great set good fun to play with. 1 of the best sets from the late 90's apart from the Res-Q sets. A good fire station.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:38:32.39Z","Worst Fire Station","When the new junior town sets came out, I was pretty disappointed.  Okay, not just disappointed but mad.  As a long time collector of town, I always admired Lego for pushing up the detail on their sets.  Now, they were taking it away (my conspiracy theory says that all their main designers were put on the Star Wars projects).  Sets like this set a really low standard for Lego in terms of detail.

Sure, the target audience was a younger generation.  But I remember vividly someone sardonically remarking how this new generation of sets basically had the formula: two walls + roof = building.  If you think that educating a kid that minimalistic designs is a great thing, then I think that you're missing the point as a designer.  

Thankfully, Lego has(d) moved these systems to a proper junior category so that I can avoid purchasing them in the future.

Now, I will say that I still find sets like this to be potentially useful.  Again, if you take the other juniorized fire sets (like the Rescue Complex and the follow up fire station) and combine them together, you can form more complex and normal looking fire buildings.  But really you shouldn't have to.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-06T05:05:16.897Z","LEGO Town (Fire) - Blaze Brigade Review","This set is a great set to have and also a great set to add to any LEGO city. It has lot's of stuff, like a truck, a helicopter, a car, two garages and a main building. The built of all models in this set is very easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. The windscreen of the helicopter opens very easily and the blades sviwel full 360°. The car has a container on the back on each side which opens. The truck has a container on each side which opens as well and on the back is a hose and a ladder which you can slide out. The ladder also sviwels full 360°. The garage with the number 1 has some accessories and an antenna and it also has a bridge which you can attach to the garage and to the main building. The garage with the number 2 has a platform for the helicopter and some accessories as well. This building also included a bridge which you can attach to this garage and to the main building.<br><br>The main building has a mail box, a tree and a flower on the front and on the top you can see an antenna and two flags. The inside has an office on the first level and on the second level we get another office. Both offices have computers and the office on the first level also has a cupboard which you can open very easily. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

You can practically count the # of pieces that are in this set from looking at the front of the box. I understand it&#39;s a &quot;junior&quot; set, but at the time I really wanted a fire station for my collection, and this was all that was offered.</p>

"peti7788","2021-11-18T13:47:29.533Z","Firefighter designers and marketers","<p><strong>This is a very important set in the history of Lego.</strong> <strong>From then on, sets&nbsp;were terribly simplified, and that was the first of these.</strong> <strong>The company reacted badly to the downturn in demand, and this determined the design of the toys&nbsp;for years.</strong></p>

<p>The assessment of the set would have improved a lot if it has been categorized as appropriate.&nbsp;It ran under a Town theme (<em>and later &quot;City Center&quot; theme</em>)&nbsp;but it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be a junior set. Previously, other more detailed Town sets were already available for 5-year-olds.</p>

<p>Had the theme&nbsp;been called <strong>&quot;Junior City Center&quot;</strong>, everyone would have been more understanding (<em>except for the price of the set</em>)</p>

<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t have been anything wrong with (<em>which makes me specifically annoyed</em>) that there aren&rsquo;t normal-sized garages for vehicles if the sets name is <strong>&quot;Mountain firefighters&quot; or &quot;Volunteer firefighters.&quot;</strong> Because sometimes even in real life, firefighting vehicles are stored outdoors, such as in bushfires in California, Greece, or Australia.</p>

<p><strong>So just by clarifying the theme and the name of the set, the Lego marketing department could have avoided a lot of misunderstandings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There would have been fewer frustrated children.&nbsp;</strong>Like me at 8 years old.</p>

<p>As the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6571-1/Flame-Fighters"" target=""_blank"">1994 fire department set </a>ran out, only this set could be purchased, there was no higher age range fire station set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s most annoying is the <strong>large built in vehicle chassis</strong>. It could have been solved with a 4x12 plate and a 2x10 brick. It would not have been more expensive, but how much more elegant, and even the wheelbase of the wheels could be changed. This is unfortunately typical of the entire late 1990s era. And the<strong> printed&nbsp;headlights</strong>,&nbsp;of course. :)</p>

<p><strong>But that&#39;s only 50% of the problem. The other is the price.</strong> Lego sold this set for almost as much money as another set of many parts and more detail. We only get a few large parts for this set, with very few rebuilding options and no alternative construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This will unfortunately happen even in 2020</strong>. The <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60246-1/Police-Station"" target=""_blank"">2020 police headquarters</a> will cost the same at Lego as the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60141-1/Police-Station"" target=""_blank"">2017 version</a>,&nbsp;in every market/region. While the 2020 police set consists of far fewer components and is also smaller. In January 2020, all 2 sets were available (<em>Lego store and&nbsp;lego.com</em>) at the same time, at the same price. Funny. No, it&rsquo;s not funny, it&rsquo;s really sad, especially <strong>since Lego isn&rsquo;t in as much financial trouble now as it was in 1997.</strong></p>

<p>I hope Lego does not make this mistake again. But in 2020, Lego&nbsp;took the name of the Junior theme again and put the junior sets under the city theme, called 4+. I hope they know how they do it.</p>
