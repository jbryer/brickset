If it just came with a bigger underwater scene and mabye another animal,I would give it a 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-18T10:56:27Z","Great Little Set","This is a great first time Lego set. It is simple and fun. Especially the raft that acttually floats. Lego could have put in 1 raft driver minifig,but the diver is cool,he has lots of gear. If this set had one more minifig and more to build I would have given it a 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-09-09T15:15:06.153Z","Nice Finding","I got this set in 2004 one day that I went to my local discount store and they have a lot of 1997 small and medium sets available, it just look like they have found an old box of Lego sets 7 years old, I ended baying almost all the sets.
This set is very nice; it has a very good minifigure with a lot of accessories, also a different shark, the cool yellow boot and the treasure chest.
It could be small but combined with other diving sets is a great addition to any Lego collection.

"WiseWarrior","2008-11-01T00:17:43.64Z","My first lego set ever","This is the set that got me into legos. I got it when I was 5, and I decided to see if I liked it. After having a blast with it I got more legos, until I had hundreds. But back to this one.

It only cost 5 dollars, so you can't expect that much, but it does have lots of cool features. The shark, complete with movable jaws, and the diver are the best. The diver has flippers, which are nice, though they fall off easily. He also has an air tank, mask, and harpoon, which I lost for 3 years and finally found behind a bookcase. LOL!

It also comes with a cool plant, and a treasure chest, which is very nice. Of course I can't forget the boat, which is a great addition to the set. All this for only 5 bucks!

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-13T08:47:32.18Z","LEGO Town (Divers) - Sea Hunter Review","This is a nice little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers in this set. This set may doesn't have any play features but we still get some nice stuff like a pile of rocks, a shark, a treasure chest, a raft, a flag and a nice looking minifigure. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great little set to have for little money - even for pieces which
 you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T12:43:53.973Z","Forgotten Treasure","<p>Set #6555 Sea Hunter: I once had two of this set because it was so small and cheap to buy and because I really liked the look of the swordfish shark creature. Like most of my older LEGO Town sets it was donated to my younger cousin during the great purge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is precious little to build up in this set, a tiny underwater construct where the jewels and treasure chest are kept and the buoy/flag indicating that someone is diving here. It also included a yellow raft, a yellow spear gun and the swordfish shark, a highly intriguing change from all the regular sharks that you got in the Pirates sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this is a fun little set and a worthy addition of any LEGO Town... Something I find myself saying a lot in these reviews. But in all honesty I can't find fault with any of these LEGO sets, at least nothing to not recommend them to anybody, even if I do find fault with them I think they're still pretty good if a bit flawed. That's what MOCing is all about.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
"T79","2016-01-08T10:31:19.71Z","Watch out for that sawfish!","<p>One of the smallest sets in the &#39;Divers&#39; theme, this set is a direct predecessor to #60090 Deep Sea Scooter from the &#39;Deep Sea Explorers&#39; theme: a lonely diver with a small support vehicle&nbsp;looking for treasure and an underwater creature to spice things up.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I no longer have the box but the instructions are a small sheet with a green gradient&nbsp;and some shadows&nbsp;as background which makes it look as if you&#39;re underwater, quite effective. Side A shows a photo of the set and lets you build the minifigure, sawfish, buoy and dinghy, side B continues with the scenery and some more photos of the set and even an alternative... build... something. For so few parts 11 steps (and some sub builds!) seems like overkill but I guess they had to fill the sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s very few parts in this set but several are rather large, such as the yellow&nbsp;dinghy which was new back then. The sawfish uses a standard shark body introduced in &#39;Pirates&#39; almost a decade earlier, but in light grey instead of dark grey while the sawfish head was also a new part. This set was probably the cheapest way to get these pieces and a printed &#39;alpha&#39; or &#39;diver down&#39;&nbsp;flag, a sea grass plant and scuba gear. A treasure chest is also included, but since the &#39;gem&#39; rock piece did not yet exist transparent round plates are used as treasure.&nbsp;It used to be so that these small plates always came two on a sprue and for a long time I have used those as gems, just like we&nbsp;used the pirate chrome gold coin sprue as gold bullion. That&#39;s right, even Lego waste material&nbsp;was useful! ;)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just one, and being a scuba diver myself this is also the greatest flaw of this set: you <em>never</em> dive alone (at least, not when you&#39;re expecting to haul up a treasure while being pestered by angry marine wildlife)! The scuba tank, dive mask and spear gun were new for this theme, the flipper footgear was already introduced with Aquazone but the red colour here was new. As far as I can tell the new deep sea theme still uses the same parts! The torso is printed with a submarine (the logo for the divers I guess) and a depth/pressure gauge. What is missing is a BCD (buoyancy control device), something which is present on the new diver minifigs but since the minifigure here is now almost 20 years old I will not hold this against him.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Arguably the weakest point of this set, even for the amount of pieces there is hardly anything here you can call a &#39;build&#39;. The outboard engine is nice (and used exactly like this in bigger&nbsp;&#39;Divers&#39; sets too) but the scenery is just some grey plates and bricks with a plant on top. #60090 does a lot better in this regard for about 10 extra pieces though they generally are smaller there (no dinghy) and it does without the rocky scenery, it just includes the plant. That said, the small rock here can easily be added to the scene of one of the bigger sets&nbsp;from&nbsp;the theme.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A dinghy with diver and buoy with diver down flag, a piece of undersea rock with a treasure chest and a sawfish. Great on its own and easy to incorporate in any other set from the theme, even if all your other sets are from the &#39;blue team&#39; you&#39;d just make this one the leader&nbsp;(the &#39;Divers&#39; theme&nbsp;apparently had two rival treasure seekers, the red team and the blue team,&nbsp; both&nbsp;being made up entirely out of clones -&nbsp;but that&#39;s a different story). The sawfish may not be the most thrilling animal to include here (a shark - or an octopus as in #60090 - could generate more danger to our intrepid diver) but since sharks appear in a lot more sets I do not mind the sawfish here, especially since it was new then.&nbsp;Besides, you could still go for a cartoon-like sawfish attack on the dinghy too. :)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>No build to speak of and lacking in realism (buddy diver, for those who care) but this should not deter anyone, get two of this or get some other &#39;Divers&#39; set to accompany&nbsp;it and only the positive points remain: sawfish, treasure, dinghy, diver, plant, flag... It works&nbsp;great on its own and even better alongside other sets from the theme.</p>

<p>EDIT: When&nbsp;me and the children&nbsp;built all our small sets&nbsp;between 26 and 30 pieces they chose this one as the best of the lot. I wasn&#39;t surprised :)</p>
