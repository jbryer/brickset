pros: great figures great playability nice truck cool labels nice boat

cons: it would be cooler if it had a grey trailer like the older truck sets from 1995 and 1994

overall:great set 9 get it if you can",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jman","2007-02-11T19:46:26.57Z","A Fun Set........Almost Perfect (4.5)","This is a fun set and the only road vehicle for the diver series. Gives you 2 minifigs which is nice so one can drive the truck and dinghy while the other one dives. The truck has those cool side panels and off-road tires. The only things (I think) missing is an antennae on the truck roof and a bar on the front of the truck to make it look more off-road like (which I added with a black plate with handle and those lever antennae's).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
