<p>This set is given as GWP for every purchase of LEGO set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10307-1/Eiffel-Tower"">10307 Eiffel Tower</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exterior of this apartment unit is in Dark Bluish Grey. I am unfamiliar with this type of colour seen on Parisian apartment. Maybe because it is located on the top part of the building that is usually in dark colour? If the exterior colour is combined with Light Tan, I think it will look better.&nbsp;The apartment where the unit is located on seems to be positioned on the corner of a street.</p>

<p>The other reason that make me think this apartment unit is located on the top most part is due to two telescopes located on the sides of this unit. To maximise the usage of telescope, high position is a must, right?</p>

<p>This set is only a cutaway of actual apartment, which I think will disappoint some AFOLs. But well, free is free, so I will take it to add into my vignette collection.</p>

<p>The walls are nicely decorated with classic Parisian style wallpapers. Those are stickers though and not printed. There is also a huge vertical thingy which I assume to be a construction pillar.</p>

<p>There is a desk with a desk lamp and letter along with a simple chair on one side of the wall. On the other side, there is a small desk with drawer and a vase on top of the desk. Next to it, there is a big table with a huge miniature of Eiffel Tower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seems the bourgeoisie gentlemen who owned the unit is an Eiffel Tower aficionado. He wears a neat suit that looks like a tuxedo. He probably is going to attend an important event or a meeting about Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Although this set is simple, it must have for vignette collector out there.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Building a vignette type of set is always fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I just wish this set will have more parts, so we can get a larger apartment unit or at least a whole unit since the set 10307 is so large itself!</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This is vignette, so mostly for display. Though it is too small when placed next to the Eiffel Tower. This set should be made larger!</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I think this set is too small when compared to the size and price of the parent set which is 10307. This set should be made larger to make the purchase of 10307 worthwhile.</p>
