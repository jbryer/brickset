Pros:
- Cool little submarine
- Nice size boat which can hold the submarine to transport it and has a winch to bring the submarine up from the depths
- Small underwater coral reef to explore
- 3 Minifigs (only one diver)

Cons:
- Underwater scene is quite small (but keeps set price reasonable)
- More underwater animals besides one sting ray (watch the tail stinger)
- No control panel/GPS for boat driver, only a steering wheel. All other diver theme boats have rader system bricks, etc. This is easily fixable with other bricks though

Overall a solid set on it's own and with other small diver sets, although if you own other large diver theme sets like Shark Cage Cove or Deep Sea Bounty it may not be as good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
