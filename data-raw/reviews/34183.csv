<p>I will be doing a short and quick review for this set.

<p>This set depicts an outdoor scene where two elves are having fun. There are mountains in the background along with two trees that looks like fir trees.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1668508557576-FNO8VEU30JS87SMTV785/2.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>There are two other trees closer to the foreground. The snow-capped trees might be a pine or spruce. These snow-capped trees are decorated with 1x1 round trans-coloured tiles to represent lights decoration on Christmas tree.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1668508557317-YW33E3DH83HCFXCLNJWF/3.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>At the foreground, the two elves are happily playing on the snow and ice. The one on the left is playing with snow sled while the elf on the right side is ice-skating. There is a little squirrel with what looks like an acorn next to it.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/60c4035e-3fdb-4c65-bc20-31347d979d40/Mechanism.JPG?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>There is a special but simple mechanism utilising gear principles. There are two gears involved. By moving the smaller gear, we can rotate the elf on ice to make him revolves while playing ice-skate.</p>

<p>The overall concept of the landscape and the set itself is amazing, and it really makes us feel the festive season! I feel like going to grab hot cocoa drink!</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>When building the base, there are a lot of small 1x1 and 1x2 parts involved, and it will feel repetitive. But I like the technique of building the mountains in the background. After completing this set, I feel satisfied with the build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Do not let the 372 pieces fool you because the set consists mostly small parts. But the amount is still reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This is vignette, so mostly for display. But children can still play this set on top of the revolving mechanism. And if you have several vignettes, then this set will definitely match with the other Wintery theme vignette sets.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>I will value this set based on the threshold required. I will say it is too high. I noticed that starting from pandemic, the threshold for getting GWP became higher.&nbsp;In the past, the threshold to get GWP is a lot lower. I think for set like this, threshold of 100 Euro/dollar/pound&nbsp;spending is enough.</p>

"Zac","2023-03-03T14:41:20.807Z","Elvesâ€™ day off","<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Compared to the amusingly terrified elf of the previous year&rsquo;s Christmas promotion, the characters in 40564 Winter Elves Scene of 2022 appear at a more light-hearted moment. This review of 40564 accompanies one of its predecessor, 40484 Santa&rsquo;s Front Yard of 2021. As with the twin Christmas vignettes of 2021, 40564 was paired with an indoor scene, 40565 Santa&rsquo;s Workshop. In both cases the outdoor scene proved more interesting and playful than the indoor one.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The forced perspective works well, and because the mountains of 40564 don&rsquo;t rise as high as the dark sky of 40484, the scene has greater intimacy, balance, and integration between the fore- and background. The string of colored lights ties together the action of the elves and the trees, which in turn help create the perspective. The lights suggest the informality of the composition compared to the more formal 40484.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal"">I find the mountains of 40564 less verisimilar than the night sky in 40484, and they contribute to a more cartoon-like aesthetic. The white tooth bricks have been particularly well-used in the mountains, as snowy overhangs. Relative to 40484, the base of 40564 consumes more pieces, especially small ones, and is correspondingly more complex. I appreciate its icy feel, but the resulting pointillism of snow and ice verges on the incoherent.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The base incorporates a mechanism to rotate the icy pond on which one of the elves is skating, reprising and simplifying the mechanism of 40416 Ice Skating Rink of 2020 to similarly delightful effect. Like its predecessor 40484, 40564 suggests a story in which the mischievous green-hatted elf surprises the skating red-hatted elf with a snowball, but their cheery expressions tell us that it&rsquo;s all in good fun, perhaps on their day off after Christmas! The adorable new squirrel piece completes the set.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal"">40564 Winter Elves Scene draws on its predecessor&rsquo;s forced perspective and interest in elves&rsquo; lives outside of the toy workshop, and adds greater opportunities for play. Five stars.</span></span></span></p>
