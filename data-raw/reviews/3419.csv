"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T15:14:50Z","Danger, sharks in the perimeter!","      This set is wicked! The sharks are very cool and the reef is very detailed. I like the details in the shark cage and there are blue divers here. The boat at topside is pretty neat and the crane thing works pretty well! Everything else is cool including the dive gear and the imprints of fish on the coral walls! All around realistic and neato!

The boat included in the set is relatively small, but it does its job well. The boat has a crane that can be used to raise and lower a net or a shark cage. 

The crane is easy to use and is great fun. The maritime flags on top are a nice touch.

The undersea scape of course has its fair share of rock formations, seaweed and treasure. The designers were even nice enough to throw in a chrome sword! You can never have too many of those. There are also 1 x 2 tiles with handles that can be used to support the divers and marine life and make it look as though they are floating. The seaweed can also support them just as well.

This set contains all three of the sharks of the Divers line: A standard gray shark also featured in Pirates sets, a great white shark, and a swordfish. 

This set is a pretty good way to get the sharks if you happen to need them, although the 6599 Shark Attack may be cheaper.

My only real gripe with this set is that it is somewhat bare. A small submarine (Which are rare for the blue divers) could have made this set a bit better. However, it's a good, relatively inexpensive way to get a Divers set, and has not inflated in price much since its release ten years ago.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
