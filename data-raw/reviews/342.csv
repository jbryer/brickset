"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-17T03:25:46Z","Lovely house set","I like the yellow roof bricks in this set a lot, and the opening side of the white vehicle is amazing.

I think this set should be re-released, but even if this set had ever been readily available, it seems too expensive to buy multiples of.
 
the back of the box designs are adequate, but the original square box with flap also features a yellow cardboard sun design in the inside! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Minifig_Man","2007-12-09T13:02:01.14Z","This has it all","A car, a van, a trailer with a boat, a house, 4 minifigs... This set has it all.
A very complete set and a great start for a town!

The only thing that is missing is a mailbox. Also a bit larger baseplate would have been nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"shenron","2007-12-28T04:46:10.61Z","Great but not perfect","This small house model is really rich with details and vehicles, with a few oddities.

The color scheme is quite odd, particularly because of the yellow roof, which on the other hand uses a very rare top yellow piece.

Internally, the kitchen is really amazing, with many tiny pieces of furniture, including an oven and a coffee machine. However, there is no upper floor, the windows are misleading: to create an upper floor it is probably necessary to enlarge the house base a little and therefore increasing its height as well.

What is odd is that the house opens to the veranda without any wall or door, and the veranda itself is empty, and serves no purpose. Something should be definitely added here. It is even more odd as you notice that this reduces the space for the garden furniture, which is a bit cramped. Probably this area can be improved by placing the fireplace (beautifully rendered) differently.

The city car is nothing special, and would look better with a sloped rear windshield.

The camper looks really great thanks for the increased height, and has four different opening parts: the front roof, the central roof and its glass, and an opening side. The latter is a tad unrealistic, but allows to operate a minifig inside. It could be further improved by adding driver's doors, which are missing to allow the front windshield to open more easily. Personally I would also prefer to have a bed inside rather than a chair, but the space is very limited. The attached bicycle is another great touch.

The small motorboat also is very well done, with a nicely hinged engine, and the carrier does its job nicely.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
