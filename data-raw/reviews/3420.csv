"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-14T22:00:00Z","Nice scene","The boat has an awesome layout.  I like how it differs from the design of other LEGO boats.  Makes it a good transport freighter if you remove the crane.    You can even modify it to be a beach landing craft.  I like the underwater scene even though the sub is not so impressive.

I often wonder why some divers have blue uniforms and others are red.  I like to think of the blue guys as a different faction competing with the red guys.

Another cool edition to this set is that it comes with some neat parts - the bubble window, the whale skeleton, and even some gold!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jman","2007-06-02T10:31:12.857Z","The Best Divers Set (Personal Favorite)","I am a big fan of scuba diving and Lego's and hence collected the entire town divers theme and this is definitely my personal favorite.

PROS
Unique designed boat that works really well as a transport/freighter
5 Minifigs (2 divers)
Lots of accessories such as dinghy, shark cage, lego tools, spear gun, underwater rov

Good assortment of sea animals (sharks, octopus, sting ray)
A 1 man submarine

The other highly ranked aspect of this set is the underwater scene which is very built up with a coral reef and a very creative whale skeleton what has a &quot;trap&quot; if you try to move the treasure chest (watch out greedy divers)

CONS
None

This an all around fantastic Lego set because of the ships, accessories and underwater scene. Enjoy.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-12T20:20:55.8Z","Fresh as harvest day!","<div>Chalk this one down to being another one of those “say, when, where, and why exactly did I get this set, anyway?”, because I can’t place this set in any context whatsoever. It’s the only set from the peculiar Divers subtheme that I own, and, looking at it now, I can’t say that it’s something I would buy in my current frame of mind.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s not to say that I didn’t get a lot of mileage out of Deep Sea Bounty when I was younger. I always viewed it as a sort of a “realistic” take on the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Aquazone"">Aquazone</a> idea, and Divers is interestingly configured because most of its sets feature some kind of boat that is clearly meant to be on the surface of the water and some kind of diorama, lab, or submarine that is obviously underwater. The brainwave that I had as a child was that I placed the boat on my bed and the “seabed” on the floor, which worked out pretty well overall.</div><div><br></div><div>Divers sets generally featured a bunch of separate elements that came together to form a scene, and Deep Sea Bounty is no different. The primary components here are the research vessel with the shark cage, the underwater whalebone superstructure, and the little exploration submarine with what I suppose must be a remote-controlled unmanned submarine that goes with it. A healthy assortment of five Minifigs populates this set, and, more than that, you also get a stingray, a sweet octopus, a shark, and an evil-looking albino sawshark - more than enough by way of underwater fauna to keep an enterprising kid busy for a long time. As expected, I’ll just go down the line and look at these elements one by one.</div><div><br></div><div>The research vessel is pretty cool, although, unfortunately, unlike the yellow dinghy, it does not float. Instead, it’s a spacious environment to place your Minifigs, and a little x-ray machine nestled in the control room works fine with those red/blue printed pieces that were all the rage in the late 90s, especially in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Exploriens"">Exploriens</a> universe where they pretty much formed a basis for an entire subtheme (I guess LEGO was really impressed with the idea). The shark cage raising/lowering mechanism works well, especially if you can find a creative placement to depict underwater/overwater somewhere in your house. The cage itself is an elegant construction that definitely conveys the right idea.</div><div><br></div><div>The submarine is nice, too, although...yellow? An odd colour choice if I ever saw one, unless the intent was to remind an older audience of a certain Beatles song, in which case it works very well. For once, the scaling down of the submarine to LEGO size actually works well, since those dinky little research subs are anything but spacious in real life anyway. The “bubble” transparent dome is an attractive addition, and the construction feels fairly watertight as a whole, so I think it works well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The whale skeleton rounds up the scene, sitting on a massive sand-coloured baseplate and flanked by hideous BURPs (with stickers!). The skeleton is actually pretty impressive, in my opinion, and the designers were definitely able to effectively give the impression of a dead whale buried in the sand. The jaw of the whale hinges open and shut to keep the treasure chest in place, and the chest comes complete with a grisly skull, ostensibly for no reason other than grim humour. There’s a net and an anchor that sort of hang around in the background, which is a bit of a shame, since these bits can surely be integrated more completely into the rest of the set with a little imagination. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I suppose it’s hard to fault Divers for being a brave foray into something different, both in terms of design and layout. Like I said earlier, I do remember having a lot of fun with this as a kid, but I think I’d find it to be too much of an acquired taste for me right now. If you’re looking to expand a thriving coastal city with something different and have a clever idea as to how to display the difference between land and the ocean, set your creativity free and you’re sure to have something cool. For the more prosaic, however, Deep Sea Bounty might be asking for a dive into the deep end. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
