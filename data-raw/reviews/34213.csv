<p>This is another amazing GWP set with Seasonal Christmas theme. It can be displayed together with the earlier LEGO <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40564-1/Winter-Elves-Scene"">40564 Winter Elves Scene</a>.</p>

<p>Two Minifigures come with this set. A cheerful elf with a green tipped brush and Santa himself. Both Minifigures does not have alternate expression though.</p>

<p>This set depict the Santa&#39;s Workshop located in a barn. It is in vignette or habitat form. We do not know why Santa build his workshop in there. It could be due to the location to be closed to the rural area and still in proximity to the city.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/b38e28e6-f18b-45d7-bb19-ceebab86779d/LEGO+40565?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>From here, we can see that Santa has modernised his toy production facility with computerised system and machineries. We can see there is a personal computer, keyboard, production system and conveyer belt. Nevertheless, the elves still manually paint the toy figure. On one corner, we can see piles of children presents.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/f4830af1-0fca-46fa-ad28-fd6c58048f50/LEGO+40565?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>Even though the production system has been modernised, the rest of the barn interior are still traditional such as the old-fashion lantern hanged on top of the barn&#39;s door. There is also a candle used inside. On top of the window, there are three different coloured jars which might be filled with paints used by the elves.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/45fb39db-3b1c-4e73-b793-8e9d100bafed/lego+40565?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>On the front&nbsp;side of the barn, the doors can be slid to both left and right sides for the worker and materials to move in and out. On the barn&#39;s door, there are two wreaths hanging.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/6eece300-a6ed-4771-8fec-d5f11d24dfb3/LEGO40565?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 401px;"" /></p>

<p>On the side of the barn, we can see the conveyor belt is delivering toys to (probably) the packaging section. The produced toys are a pair of rollerblades, a pink console controller, a gold coloured figure, and a yellow car.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/2fe595f9-f11f-4728-9601-cf428d824f12/LEGO+40565+leftover+parts?format=600w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 340px;"" /></p>

<p>The leftover parts from these sets are quite generous. We can see many colourful parts and also usable parts such as microfigures, printed 1x1 tiles, rollerblade and candle flame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set LEGO 40565 Santa&#39;s Workshop can be displayed along with the previous GWP set LEGO 40564 Winter Elves Scene. When placed together, we can see a scene where the elves are taking break by playing outdoor for relaxation before they return to work.</p>

<p>For vignette (or habitat) collectors, you should nail this set!</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Building vignette is always fun! Though it will be great to build an entire barn.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>It is okay, though personally, I prefer more parts, so I can get a whole barn.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This is mostly for display as vignette. But children definitely will have fun playing with this scene!</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>It is GWP. But the buying threshold is quite high nowadays.</p>
