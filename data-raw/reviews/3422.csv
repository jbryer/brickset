Think a drive-in diner would fit these two unique vehicles better (not that I'm complaining). Pretty sure my dad played with those cars about as much as I did.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-03-04T10:11:43.03Z","more leisure for minifigs!","remembering this set, one painfully realises that the catalogue of this year offers no occasions for minifigs to relax and enjoy there spare time. this was different once, just think of the whole paradisa line. the hot rod club perfectly expresses the minifigs' need for fun, sport and distraction from their daily work in police stations, fire brigades, post offices or on construction sites. 
three laid-back lads in their casual outfits, twiddling their engines, having a drink now and then, probably discussing football games - the set provides a pleasant atmosphere of relaxation. the hot rods are well built and detailed, whereas the garage is rather a skeleton of a building, leaving you with your own imagination and creative skills.

to sum it up: a fine set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Noah1997","2009-09-26T18:39:20.28Z","Chill out at the hot rod club","This set is fun! my favorite hot rod is the yellow one, I love making the hot rods race you can change the red hot rods wheels, but you can't change the yellow cars wheels the broom is great so is the oil can I broke the motorcycle the drink cooler is pretty cool, I think the red hot rod looks goofy with the pipes but thats just my opinion, Over all I would give this set a 4 and a half out of 5!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"cameljockie","2009-07-28T11:31:49.327Z","A 90s classic...","I remeber getting this set way back in 1995. The town theme then was really starting to expand and experiemtn by creating niche sets like this. To my knowledge this is one of the few sets that caters for 'Hot-rods', especially for any country outside of the U.S.A. 

First off, the garage may be plain and small but fits surprisingly well with the two vehicles you get. At the time, it was a novelty to see lego desgin cars with fat rear axles like these. But again that is what Hot Rods are about.

Both cars have external engines which I thought was novel. The Red and black car has a beautiful chrome exhaust and a nice sleek 1950s look. the yellow is similar with an added detail of a sticker on the back ofa sunset. 
The motor bike tops off the set well for anyone wanting a bit of variety. 

So heres the round up:

Pros:
- Fantastic car design.
- Chrome exhausts!
- Trendy looking figures (for the time)
- Drinks machine/fridge. 
- Repair bay with assortment of tools.
- Trolley and plenty of spair wheels
- Club logo!

Cons:
- They dont make anything like this now!

So there you have it. A perfect addition to anyones town or city whether you like hot rods or not, you cant not enjoy the play or display value of this set!

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-20T04:08:23.763Z","LEGO Town (Vehicles) - Hot Rod Club Review","This is a great addition to any LEGO City for sure. This set is very easy to build as well. We also get a few stickers to worry about. We get lot's of stuff like a black motorcycle, a yellow vintage car and a vintage car in black and red. The garage is very cool as well. The yellow car has an engine which sviwels and the doors on each side and the ceiling on the top opens very easily, too. The play features on the other vintage car are the same but it has a different design than the yellow one. The garage has a minibar, some tools and extra tyres for the vehicles. It's a very nice set to have and to play with for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
