"jinxjinx550","2010-05-10T09:52:24.263Z","Outstanding Small City Set","<p>I had absolutely no expectations of this set when I found its pieces at a flea market, but after building it I was blown away.&nbsp; There is something beautiful about the way the set is proportioned, and how much of the feeling of a gas station you get from the three components included.</p>
<p>I agree with the reviewer who suggested not to get this set unless you already have a car but really -- practically everybody has a car or two, and this set makes you want to get more, just so they can fill up at this station.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Well-designed tanker truck with hose &amp; pumping controls</li>
    <li>Realistic pump island with canopy</li>
    <li>Money machines at the pump island</li>
    <li>Gas station gadgets like the hydraulic jack, handbrush, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stickers</li>
    <li>No overall baseplate</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, even with a few tiny flaws, this is a set that will have you grinning because it looks so good from every angle.&nbsp; Plus, it combines so well with other sets and city layouts.&nbsp; This set is really a classic.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-14T05:52:56.11Z","LEGO Town (Shops and Services) - Gas Stop Shop Review","This is a great set to have and it's a fun set to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers in this set. This set also has some cool stuff like a tow truck, a tank truck and the gas station itself. The tow truck as a nice hook which sviwels. You're also able to pick some other cars up with this piece. There's also a nice headlight which sviwels. The tank truck has a door on each side which can be opened and the ceiling can be opened as well. The gas station has a container where you can put the money in and we also get some nice tools and two hose pieces. I also like the design of the sign and the flags ont he top of the gas station. It's a cool set to add to any LEGO city for sure.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2011-01-13T08:49:54Z","It's the predeccessor to the Tank truck!","While this set cannot match amazing sets such as the Deep Freeze Defender<br>and Royal Knights Castle part for part, this is one heckuva town set.<br><h4>Box/Instructions</h4>The outline houses are there, as well as some foliage. A simple but<br>effective scene shows just how playable this set is-not at all surprising,<br>since multiple vehicles means extreme playability.<br><h4>Parts</h4>You get stickers. It's annoying. However, they are very nice and are still<br>stuck on my copy of the set. In addition to this, you get the old tow truck<br>hook, a sunroof, some curved plates, 2 string pieces, and other parts. There's<br>a hairbrush and a broom-I never expected the hairbrush to come in the set<br><h4>Minifigures</h4>The minifigures consist of two identical smiling Octan workers and a truck<br>driver with a jacket. The jacket rocks.<br><h4>The build</h4>It's fun. I really like the tank part-it fits in without any little things<br>jutting out. Both vehicles are not particularly amazing, and neither is the<br>station. But it's better than I've seen for sets this big.<br><h4>The completed model</h4>It's awesome. The tank truck has great parts use and works-the tow truck<br>could be better. The station is simple, but it too works. It's fun to play<br>with, and provides hours of fun for the imaginative kid.<br><h4>Summary</h4>The set is very good. A 25 dollar set-it's not a perfect 10 cents per part, but it is a very nice value. If you can get this complete with stickers from 22-26, consider it a good deal. I recommend this to the town fan. While the tank truck isn't the same as the new one, it certainly is very well done.",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T13:10:00.597Z","Your One Stop Shop for all your Gas Needs","<p>Set #6562 Gas Stop Shop: This fun looking little set was one I had growing up and one that offered up a lot of fun and fond memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gas Stop Shop is a small little gas station with two pumps, a miniature tow truck and a larger fuel transport truck. Stickers were used for the Octan logos, but the cash register brick was printed. It came with an older set of tools as accessories, a wrench, a screwdriver, a socket wrench, a hammer and even an oil can. (Basically all of the tools used by the Surgical Droid in Darth Vader Transformation from Star Wars.) There was also a broom and a bristle brush, not sure what that would be used for at a service station, but it was a fun little accessory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three Mini-Figures are two Octan Employees and the truck driver, also an Octan employee, but wearing blue instead of green. The truck in this set looks pretty decent as far as LEGO Vehicles are concerned, it is a far cry better than the tow truck included with this little set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that if you're looking for a service station or gas station to add to your LEGO City display you might prefer the newer sets offered through LEGO City, but if you want to have something with potential for MOCing or just prefer the Octan brand name to faceless gas stations then this little set would make a pretty good addition... Especially if you have more than one LEGO Town/City, with suburbs and outlaying cities that don't need fancy large sized gas stations to service their populace.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
