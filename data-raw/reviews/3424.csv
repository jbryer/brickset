"joel92","2010-01-08T12:12:12.687Z","Great set, although maybe a bit shady","One of my all time favorites.  This set had it all, including the awesome airplane and fan-boat.  I never really quite figured out the purpose of this set though.  My parents and I always dubbed it the ""bayou drug runners"" set.

This set will always hold a special place in my collection",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
