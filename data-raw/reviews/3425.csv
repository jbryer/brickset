It is not a junior set in my opinion and the play value is great, and so is the minfig and garbage truck. But it does need improvment on the back of it so it keeps the rubbish in. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vagabondma","2005-06-18T17:21:47Z","Too juniorized","I originally bought this set because I wanted a a refuse truck and missed out on the nice ones earlier in the 90s.  The set took about a minute to put together.  A lot more thought could have been put into the model.",FALSE,1,1,1,2,1
"Blade","2008-04-07T23:38:02.17Z","Another one that should have been Junior LEGO","This set was another great big let down. I remember getting this set and being so disappointed with it. For the size and price you thought you were getting something good but no. The instructions have a whole three steps which should automatically tell you there is something wrong here. I know old school sets had smaller instructions but this is ridiculous. Consisting of 35 pieces you would think it was good, once you take the wheels off, take out the mini-fig and bins you have a whole 13 pieces.

The model is mainly blue and black, with some rubbish bins. The black under carriage is one solid piece, like something designed for a three year old. The rubbish bins don't stay in the vehicle, the slightest angle and they fall straight out. It happened to me like three times in five minutes. The only good thing about the whole design is the fact that the front lights and the recycling sign are painted on.

The mini-fig is strange too. He is dressed in the classic green jacket and pants but the graphics on the jacket seem poor and the graphic on his face seems slightly thicker than usual, making him look like a cheap imitation. He also has green peak cap.

As southerncaliforniadude! said if you took off the recycling symbol you couldn't tell what it was and as vagabondma said it literally took me under one minuite to build. I really wanted this model when I was younger as it was blue and I loved the colour and I liked the figure and the extras like the bins but the model was a bigger let down than 6446 (Crane Truck from 1999).

Overall this model was a real let down for me and it really reminds me of some cheap LEGO rip-off. Because the bins fall out so easily it gets annoying during play, but aesthetically it looks ok. If it wasn't blue I'd rate it a two and as bmwlego said if it had stickers it would be a one. I feel this model is about a 3/10, mainly due to lack of pieces and playability. If you see it for like $1 at a garage sale get it, if not your not missing out on anything.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-26T12:17:52.14Z","Printed Parts Save this from a 1","This Recycle Truck has printed parts (unlike the Recycle Truck of 2007), a minifig and a trash can. The blue color scheme works nicely too. That is what I can say that is positive. I purchased this as part of a HUGE yard sale find and would not have purchased it if I was into LEGO in the 90's. I don't want to be too critical of this set so I'll leave it at that.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Eric_Botswana","2008-10-11T03:28:38.623Z","Garbage","This was the only Lego set I bought when I went to Legoland in Denmark. Ruined the great memories for that day, because it was made during that era where Lego obviously thought kids were too dumb too put together complicated models so they put stuff out like this with a dozen chunky pieces. Except for the minifig you'd swear this was a Fabuland model. The range of designs you can make consist of: 1) A garbage truck 2) A flatbed truck 3)Er... a stack of blue rectangles? Great way to stifle creativity, Lego. And thanks for a set I could put together on the Billund to Vejle bus in one minute leaving me to look at grass out the window for half an hour.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2010-09-29T23:43:09.89Z","This set is a garbage truck-it's barely worth more than that, unfortunately","The Recycle Truck is interesting, due to the fact that it is ultra-juniorized. The truck is so simple, I could build it with my eyes closed and hands bound behind my back. This was a Town Jr. set, so like them, it has practically no features, but looks cool on a box.<br><h4>Parts</h4>This is what saves this from a 1. It has a few nice pieces, which serve as windows (or other things too). Especially the printed one, which is useful when recycle parts are rare. The auto front piece is also nice. There's not much else to it, though there are two trash cans (which I love).<br><h4>Playability</h4>It's playable, but there's not too much. Open trash can. Take out black piece. Put in truck. Drive truck away. That's really all there is to it. However, it can be useful if you have other stuff to do (and if you were to improve this).<br><h4>Design</h4>There's not much to say about the design. It's boring. There's an odd yellow cyclinder there (I don't know why, but I guess it's a bit rare). The most interesting design in there, sadly, are the trash cans-probably the detail on them, but also the fact taht you can put that piece on there.<br><h4>Price</h4>AGH! Do you have to ask? Seriously though, the price is over-the-top. There's not much value in this set, yet it costs almost as much as a Toa. There are many better sets for only 50 cents more (or 5.50 less). <br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Recycle</li><li>Trash Cans</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Juniorized</li><li>High Price</li><li>Boring</li><li>Crappy Design</li><li>Almost void of useful parts</li></ul><h4>Recommendations</h4>Not recommended. Unless you find one really cheap and you want the recycle part, don't get it-you can probably get the only useful part on bricklink for a few cents.<br><br>",TRUE,2,3,1,2,1

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-09T21:36:04.457Z","A terrible set, but a kid wouldn't care.","<p>I remember this set well from childhood. I thought it was incredibly neat to model things I saw in my day to day life in my city. Helicopter transports and fireboats and space shuttles were all fine and good but the things that stuck out to me were the kinds of things that were relatable; gas stations, truck stops, restaurants, and yes, garbage trucks.</p>

<p>I always thought it was really cool to have a garbage truck I could drive around my Lego town in my bedroom. After all, thought ten year old me, what better way to lend authenticity to my town than having something that actually existed in my real life town?</p>

<p>Well, now I&#39;m all grown up and not quite as easily impressed and see this set for what it is: incredibly lazy. It&#39;s difficult to believe Lego could make a more halfhearted attempt at a garbage truck if they tried, and in the years since it&#39;s become apparent to me that they can in fact make an excellent model of a garbage truck if they do try. This, however, isn&#39;t it.</p>

<p><strong>The model: </strong>This resembles a garbage truck fine in the mind of an over imaginative ten year old, and not at all in the mind of basically everyone else on earth. For one, there&#39;s no roof. A convertible garbage truck would be a terrible idea for numerous reasons, the smell not being the smallest among them. For two, there&#39;s nothing actually separating the garbage from the driver. For three, the truck doesn&#39;t even have a back door, or indeed anything to keep any of the black cylindrical bricks that represent garbage, actually inside the truck.</p>

<p>This is basically one big design flaw. Making the truck just a few studs longer and adding a roof, divider, and just a small flap or something on the back of it would have gone a long ways in making this actually a garbage truck. As is, it&#39;s a convertible with a large tube in the back of it and an odd logo on the side.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Very, very poor. This model doesn&#39;t even stay together all that well. You&#39;ll notice on the roof, there&#39;s a red grill tile (why, I have no idea) and basically nothing else. This is to say the three huge pieces that make up the back do not even stay together all that well, as there is nothing above them to keep them tightly held together and held down. This is Lego building 101: Put something both above and below an assembly to make sure it stays sturdy. One 2x4 blue tile would&#39;ve worked wonders but as is, it barely stays together. Now when you&#39;re a little kid playing with it, the truck accidentally shattering while you play with it can be a fun time. When you&#39;re an adult trying to put it on display, not so much. The building experience of this set can be summed up with &quot;they didn&#39;t care and weren&#39;t trying&quot;. There is literally nothing running along the top of the truck to keep the thing held together, so it falls apart super easily, particularly with the fact that bricks&#39; hold naturally gets somewhat weaker over time (and it&#39;s been a lot of time since this set came out). Normally that isn&#39;t a bad thing, and is easily dealt with. When the model has absolutely nothing holding it together, that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Probably the best part about this. The parts aren&#39;t great but they&#39;re passable. The recycling logo brick being the best among them simply by virtue of being the only one that is an exclusive. You can use that part to make a more well made garbage truck with some imagination added. The two trash cans are always a welcome addition to any city, the chassis is a nice thing to have as is the grill brick. It&#39;s not great but considering probably six out of the twenty six pieces are rare-ish and useful it&#39;s okay.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>The other best part. When I was a kid I loved this thing. If you&#39;re a kid it&#39;s easier to look past the abysmal job of modelling the prototype this vehicle did and just look at it and go &quot;cool a garbage truck, I know what that is!&quot; like I did. It honestly doesn&#39;t look horrible, just weird due to the lack of a roof. You can add a roof easily enough but it&#39;ll still look a bit too tall and a bit weird no matter what you do to it.</p>

<p><strong>Value for the Money: </strong>Surprisingly high, considering the trash cans, the large truck chassis that can be used to make much better things, and the exclusive blue recycling logo piece. If the set was even a dollar more the value would be terrible but when it came out it was dirt cheap and it&#39;s still pretty dirt cheap if you know where to look. Dear god, do not pay more than ten dollars for this set, but if you can find it for the single digits it give you another civilian minifig (always handy), two trashcans (always handy), some nice blue pieces (most of which are more at home on a building than a vehicle), and an okay framework for a custom made garbage truck.</p>

"peti7788","2022-11-17T22:41:53.087Z","Dirty garbage truck","<p>I love the classic town maintenance vehicles, except for this one.&nbsp;This is practically a duplo-like vehicle, just made of system parts.&nbsp;At least the chassis could have been in 2 parts, plus the axles.&nbsp;Say a 4x12 plate and a 2x10 brick. Even a 5-year-old can easily put this together.</p>

<p>This way, however, you can build it in 30 seconds, you don&#39;t have the lego experience, and the end result is not pretty either.&nbsp;There is no hinge or mechanism to dump the garbage.&nbsp;Thus, the game function is quite limited.</p>

<p>Even then, when I was a child, I thought it was stupid that there was no separation between the driver&#39;s cab and the waste container.&nbsp;And children don&#39;t like to be seen as stupid.&nbsp;The poor driver gets the smell of garbage and it&#39;s not very hygienic.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>Regular 90&#39;s town guy.&nbsp;This face print and torso print have been used in many sets, quite common.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Compared to how few parts the set consists of, it cost quite a lot. The piece/price ratio was not very good at that time, between 1997 and 2003.&nbsp;The two previous garbage trucks (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6693-1/Refuse-Collection-Truck"" target=""_blank"">6693</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6668-1/Recycle-Truck"" target=""_blank"">6668</a>) were much more realistic and detailed, with more play functions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommend it more for children between 3 and 5 years old who just want to pushing and rolling the vehicles.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>If the goal was to build a garbage truck from a few basic parts and easy build, I would have done this:</p>

<p>At least at the back, you can empty the bin with a simple hinged brick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the truck has headlights and a roof.</p>
