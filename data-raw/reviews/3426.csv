This remains one of, if not my favorite, set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-19T21:18:05.687Z","my first set EVER. ","its wierd how both the other reviewers said this was there first set too. now this set would seem like a waste of time but what i liked back then the sets for younger kids (the old 1997-2000 city sets) had actual bricks and figures instead of the 4 juniors sets.

anyway on with the review!

this set is very nice. i got it when i was 4 and i lived it! its got 3 vehicles for a cheap price. the vehicles dont take much time to build and helps for younger kids. its got loads of acesories. (shovel, broom, cones, baricades, some &quot;dirt&quot; pieces and a black piece which i called a tool box at the time). the vehicles are cool and the loader actually works and the dump truck is good for younger builders. the supply truck was probabilly the hardest to build but there all easy.

its a great set for a younger one but for someone who is 8 or older, they might get board.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"amandojames","2008-12-07T05:35:23.483Z","Possible the worst set ever released.. even the pieces are junk!","    Looking at the box, I thought this was quite a neat construction set from my observation. It had yellow inverted slopes and plates needed for my personal collection.. or so I thought. So I ended up buying this thing for $15. When I came home to assemble it, little did I know that the pieces I wanted were fused together to form an ugly, unimaginative piece, on all three vehicles !
   I really felt cheated and deceived. This set alone almost turned me away from LEGOs. Thankfully, there was 2148 LEGO truck to change my view on LEGO.

Bottom line: If you want to spend $15 on a town set, don't get this piece of junk! Get 2148 instead. Back in 1997 I remember spending $10-11. A much Better price and set!

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>This set has 3 instructions which only have 2 pages. There're no mistakes in any instruction.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of yellow pieces which are always great to add in future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We get 3 minifigs with this set. 2 of them look exactly the same: They have a blue overall and a red helmet. The other one has a blue overall, a white shirt and a red helmet.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very quick and easy and we don't need to complain about stickers as well. <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6565-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has 3 vehicles. We get a front-end loader, a mini dumper and a truck. The truck has some accessories which are always useful for any construction site you want to build. The front-end loader has a shvel which you can adjust very easily and the mini dumper doesn't do anything. All of those vehicles are very small if you compare them to the ones we get for the LEGO City theme today.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
