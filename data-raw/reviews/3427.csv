"CyandraZ","2007-08-19T13:31:53.77Z","Not half bad, for Town Jr.","6566 is a very interesting case. On the one hand, it is a town jr kit, and as we all know, they don’t exactly have the best designs (in fact, they are often terrible). But, on the other hand, this kit isn’t half bad overall, both in design and pieces, and even in minifigures. Let’s take a look, shall we?

Okay, first things first, this bank is small. Very small. The classic bank of the 80’s dwarfs this midget. On the positive side, it has some nice details built into it, mainly the security camera, ATM, and cash register. More importantly, the design is actually compact, not ridiculous, and not especially juniorized.

Even the armored car isn’t half bad. True, the chassis is extremely juniorized, but the design of the body saves it from looking childish. Actually, I like it better than the armored car in the classic bank! The safe door on the back is especially neat (using a house window was a great idea!), and overall this baby’s pretty darn solid in design, if you ignore the juniorized chassis. Still, it need a bit of modifying, as there is no roof!

Even piecewise, 6566 isn’t half bad. The four black walls could actually come in great handy in a MOC, as could the black door, printed windows and red window frames, and even the ATM box! Plus, you get 4 dollar bill tiles and four coins, plus two small bank safes (printed mailboxes) to put the money in.

You get two figures, a mustached bank worker, and a sunglassed bank worked with a green armed version of the other’s torso. Both are wearing white hats that look perfect on bank workers, and the torsos are pretty nice, too (although, I don’t understand the sunglasses).

This really is a toughie. On the one hand, the old bank is much better than this newer one, but on the other hand, 6566 is fairly decent. My advice: buy the old one if you want a great bank for your town, but if you don’t have the space for a large one, or dislike the armored car in the old bank, buy 6566. 

As a final thought, I’d never thought I’d say this, but this is one Town Jr. kit I don’t regret getting. 7/10

There was a 'limited release' bank which came out in 1990, but that sells for such high prices these days it's for collectors only.  The only other Town bank I'm aware of is this.  This is a shame, because it's terrible.  The building looks like a Basic '3+' set, and the vehicle is only average.  I'd assume building Lego Town models was no longer meant to take priority by the late nineties.  The fun was meant to come from playing cops and robbers or whatever.  There are useful money-related pieces, but if that's all you want you'd be better off with one of the Western sets.  This bank isn't a patch on 1490 and, if you just want to play at bank robberies, you'd be much better off with Western's 6765 set.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Brickster9Ge","2008-09-06T00:25:24.937Z","Big city bank?!","The reason I give the review the title &#171;Big city bank?!&#187; is because its picture is in front of some skyscrapers and the bank is on a base that measures 8&#215;16 studs and the complex is smaller than that.
Pros:
- It is a bank
- It has an A.T.M
- There is a truck
- The bank has banknotes and shrapnel
- It has minifigures
- It isn't flimsy like my Cargo Centre 6330
- With a bit of imagination, the truck/van-thing can be utilised as an armoured transport for prisoners.
Cons:
- Hardly anywhere for people to queue
- No protection for the cashier if the patron pulls out a weapon
- If a patron pulled out, say a knife, and attacks the cashier, the person drinking coffee upstairs &amp; listening to his iPod may hear the cashier's screams as he's being assaulted, the person drinking coffee upstairs &amp; listening to his iPod could then alert the police, who'd better be nearby!
- The camera on top can't see the situation downstairs unfold and serves a far more practical purpose as a traffic-cam watching what's happening at the intersection at the other end of the street. That's what my one does; how handy!
- The flowerbed is an obstruction to the A.T.M.
It's OK as a rural small town bank, but that's not something I would expect to see if I was visiting western Europe.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-30T15:04:32.873Z","We Got Robbed!","I played with this set over at a friend's and think it is cool. There are two minifigs, an armored vehicle, a bank and alot of other stuff.

BANK
The bank isn't that great as it is so tiny and there are no stairs connecting the two floors. Building is also limited due do the large pieces used to build the structure. The CCTV camera adds decor to the bland look of the bank. 

VEHICLE
The vehicle is very well-constructed and there is a space to put the money at the back. It also fits only one minifig driver.

MINIFIGS
There are two minifigs. The Bank Manager in the grey shirt seems to be in charge of all financing affairs. The other one is the Armored Truck Driver, who has the common face in the late 1990's Town sets. A gag can be seen on the cover box, where the Bank Manager is holding a safe bigger than his torso with only one arm. (Have you tried lifting a safe before? Its very heavy)

ACCESSORIES
As the most abundant part of the set, money comes in and we're talking big money. There are alot of LEGO coins and paper bills included in this set so I doubt that you'll ever be in debt again.


All in all, this set could be better if the building were less boring. Other than that, the armored truck is awesome and the money is too. I recommend this set as it easily fits into the city.

This is an incredibly useful set.  It's small yet multi-storied and can be integrated numerous times in town (meaning you can pick up a few more of these).  Or you can take 2-3 of these and improve on the complexity of this set.  The office windows and large walls can help create a nice foundation for a much larger bank or office even.

It comes with 2 bankers which have a nice rare suit torso. We also don't get any stickers which is really cool about this model. This set includes a bank and a truck. The truck looks awsome - even if it's smaller than the newer versions from the LEGO City theme. There's a nice black grill on the front and there're some nice headlights on the front as well.

This is, it just doesn't fit in a ""classic"" town.  The truck is bulky, the building is just blah.

I did however use the doors and windows and such and modified it to make a more ""classic"" bank.  I made a truck using the old ""delivery van"" model.

Otherwise, I guess I did get a few minifigs and flowers out of it.

However, now that I know about the old bank, I think I will use the parts inventory for it and just build that.

<p>The one thing all the other reviewers seem to agree on is that LEGO doesn't have enough bank sets for their Town/City theme. The other thing that sticks out is that this set is LEGO Jr., meaning that there is huge amount of simplicity with this set.<br></p>

<p>I had initially picked this set up off e-bay after getting the Spiderman 2 Doc 
Ock's Bank Robbery set with knowing that I wanted to expand on the bank 
front with the Spiderman Set with the intention and purpose of building a bigger Bank design for my Spiderman set.</p></div>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>You get two instruction booklets for this set. The first is for building the Armored Car and the second for building the bank itself.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 99 pieces in all for this set. Notable are the red window panes and the big 1x6x5 wall pieces. You do get a LEGO atm ""mailbox"" piece, printed money tiles, computer monitor and keyboard. A lot of little things that do add up for some detailing.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two Bank Minifigures, one of whom drives the Armored Car and the other who acts as a teller for inside the bank.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>There's basically two parts to this set. The first being the Armored Car vehicle. Which doesn't seem quiet so armored given that the front where the driver sits is open. But the back end of the car does well enough with holding the two big safes that are inside being transported.</p><p>The other build is for the bank itself and with all the large wall pieces and window pieces. The build comes across as extremely simple and really small. It's only with the atm piece, money pieces and the computer desk that you get any notable details or mini builds that make this set what it is.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>So while the build is extremely simple and small, there's a lot of good pieces that add character and detail to this set. However with more recent sets like the Bank &amp; Money Transfer set out, there are better Bank sets that LEGO puts out and has. They just happen to be far and few in between with several sets like the Spiderman Bankset, being nothing more than a facade front. Any good LEGO bank is good though for a City given the amount of Police and Fire vehicles there are, ya' need to get some variety and character in.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
"iamcjb","2011-01-16T14:26:02.703Z","Too simple","<p>I bought this back when my friend and I were really into Lego police. I got this for my burglar to have somewhere to cause havoc, and the fact that it was cheap as chips.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are clear enough, but pointless as the set is so easy to make.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The banks is mostly large parts so goes together quickly. The bonus of this set is the bank notes and vaults, the computer and the ATM.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Two guys in bank uniforms which are pretty rare but can't really double up for anything else.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The building itself is very simple and the truck isn't overly difficult either. It's a good set for younger builders, as it really isn't difficult.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The bank looks a bit basic and I thought the double floor layout was a bit pointless. A single floor with more space would have made more sense. The truck is ok, but I think it looks more like a snow plough and a bank truck. I ended up modifying it to make it taller. The best thing about the set are the small decorations, like the camera and the ATM. I think these pieces barely make this set justifiable.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>It's not great, but as mentioned by many before me, the lack of banks until recently and its low price make this set buyable. There are some useful pieces, but generally it's too bland and far too small. The truck also could have been better designed. I recently had a look at 3661, and would advise anybody to go for that set before considering this one.</div>",TRUE,2,3,1,2,3
"Heliatck","2018-11-27T23:51:39.7Z","Some useful parts","<p>There have not been that many banks before, so this is somewhat of an interesting set in that sense.</p>

<p>This set was released at the height of the juniorisation madness in Lego HQ. It contains one small building and a money transport truck.</p>

<p>Big parts are used throughout and so this set comes in at just under 99 parts. The set retailed for 15$.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Looking at the building, you will notice the color scheme is kind of weird. They chose a combination of gray, black and red which I have not ever seen on a real building. Think about how many buildings with black walls you have seen? Anyway, the building is super basic and no surprise it looks very blocky. Some people might call that modern, I call it lazy.</p>

<p>For the truck, again you&#39;ll see a lot of typical junior parts. Big chassis, the dreaded slope with printed headlights and other big parts. The color scheme here makes a lot more sense and it does look like an actual money transport, but maybe a convertible version (there&#39;s no roof)?</p>

<h2>Play &amp; Build</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll not spend more than 10-15 minutes building this set. It&#39;s just large piece upon large piece upon large piece, upon... yawn...</p>

<p>As for play: I could see some fun if you had a bank robber to steal the cash, but on it&#39;s own there is not much to do besides loading and unloading the safe boxes.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p>This set was not too expensive, but then again you are not getting a whole lot. This is one of those sets you might consider getting because it looks like it has some useful parts. Hmmm... if you can pick it up for a fiver, I&#39;d say go for it. If not, just Bricklink the parts and you&#39;ll be better of.</p>

<p>The parts you&#39;ll probably want are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minifigs</li>
	<li>Cash (pretty common)</li>
	<li>Printed $1x4 bricks</li>
	<li>Printed window inserts</li>
	<li>Door with ATM print</li>
	<li>Door with $ print</li>
</ul>

<p>Buy those and I&#39;m sure you will be able to make a much nicer looking bank! The rest of the parts is trash / common anyway so don&#39;t bother.</p>

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-13T18:19:41.837Z","Mostly killer, little filler","<p>I&#39;m a sucker for little &quot;slice of life&quot; Lego sets like this one. The bank isn&#39;t being robbed by the Brickster, there aren&#39;t a million cops in helicopters descending upon the bank, nothing out of the ordinary going on at all, really. It&#39;s just a bank, the type of small-town bank that&#39;s found all over the world. This is one of the best Town Jr. sets. It packs so much in a mere 99 pieces it&#39;s insane. The best part by far is the bank building, the armored car, while a nice detail, leaves a little to be desired. But as far as having a nice new building for your town that ISN&#39;T a police station or fire station, this set is superb for what it is.</p>

<p><strong>The Building: </strong>By far the best part about this set. Is it juniorized? Well, yeah, it is, shockingly enough for a 1997 vintage Lego set, but this is one of the few times that it really doesn&#39;t knock too much against it. It&#39;s got everything it needs and nothing it doesn&#39;t. There&#39;s a public-access area on the bottom floor, featuring a teller, a computer, and a cash drawer. There&#39;s an employee-only area on the top floor, featuring a computer console that appears to have a direct line with the police (a silent alarm perhaps?). There&#39;s a security camera (great touch, though it could use another), and my favorite part, the ATM. ATM&#39;s are not exactly common among Lego sets and this is a great representation of one. I particularly like that it&#39;s attached to the main bank building, as most ATM&#39;s in real life are. The little green plant awning thing above the ATM is a great touch as well.</p>

<p>It looks like a branch bank. Maybe not the central, main bank, but certainly looks bank-ish enough to be a small town branch. The only real design flaws of the building are that there isn&#39;t much on the top floor (easily enough added, though) and that there are no stairs leading up to floor two (though again, you can add that and again, almost no buildings of the time period *did* have stairs in them). This thing makes a fantastic addition to a Lego town. With minor modifications it can get even better if you&#39;re so inclined.</p>

<p><strong>The Armored Car: </strong>Unfortunately this is the weakest part of the set. Nothing deal breaking but unlike the bank building proper, this thing is a bit lacking in the believability department. Back in 1997 Lego&#39;s Town design department appeared to have been run by someone with a deep-seated phobia of car roofs, having had one terrorize them as a child causing deep seated psychological trauma. This person issued a decree that no Lego town set under his watch shall have a vehicle with a roof (except a couple of course) and this one was no exception, and probably one of the strangest roofless vehicles. A convertible garbage truck is odd but not technically impossible. A convertible armored car? Yeah that&#39;s a bit much.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s a rollbar, because you hae to have that rollbar everywhere, even places like here where it makes absolutely no sense because there&#39;s nothing really blocking the money-containing part of the van from the driver, so it&#39;s not very armored or secure at all. There are sirens above the windshield that are a nice touch (or would be, if it had a roof), and the big grill piece on the front of it does wonders for making it look &quot;armored&quot;, as do the fence bricks on the side. It&#39;s a shame the silly rollbar and lack of roof are there, just because other than that this is a great little model. It looks utilitarian enough for its purpose and I actually really like the use of a window pane brick with a little clip brick on it as the &quot;armored door&quot; on the back of the armored car. Is it super realistic? Well, no, but it looks the part and a ten year old&#39;s imagination won&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>I also wish they&#39;d have re-enforced the top of the back of the van. The three window blocks that make up the back of the van are only connected to the car by the bottom of them, and good Lego design 101 is &quot;always re-enforce things on the top and bottom where feasible&quot;. It would be plenty easy to do with this (and I did as a child), just add a 4x6 plate to the top of it. On the same token, another 4x6 plate on top of that in the front gives this vehicle a roof with the added authenticity that comes with that.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>I feel so bad always giving low rankings for this category. I swear there are good building experiences out there, just none of them were in the Town line of &#39;97 through &#39;99. It&#39;s not a bad experience at all, but the only real noteworthy parts of it are A) the clip on brick acting as a handle for the van backdoor... Creative, and I wouldn&#39;t have thought of trying that, and B) the neat way of attaching the security camera so it can swivel back and forth. Both cool little bursts of creativity, but other than that it&#39;s stacking the huge pre-made walls and floors.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Now this is what I&#39;m talking about. This thing has one fewer than a hundred pieces and so many of them are rare, exclusive, and handy it&#39;s insane. The armored car side panels with the money printed decal are exclusives. The bank windows with the money logo are exclusive to this set and essential for building another bank of this scale. The ATM contanier flap is exclusive and very good looking. The security camera is at least pretty rare and handy to have, the computer bricks and keyboard tile are rare to the point of being welcome in anything, and the huge amount of money tiles and coin accessories are welcome additions to stimulating any Lego town&#39;s burgeoning economy. Great in the parts department, worth getting for that alone. Also the money-transporting containers are extremely hard to find and add a lot of playability to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:&nbsp; </strong>Very high. The troubles this bank can get up to if you&#39;re ten years old or thereabouts is insane, and of course the displayability if you&#39;re an adult that likes to display Lego sets is also high. Many different scenes and poses possible. the money transporting safes fit perfectly in the back of the armored car, the ATM can actually hold money inside of it, the cash drawer opens to reveal coins, the inside of the bank is very well illuminated due to its open nature... excellent playability. Whoever designed this set put a whole lot in a very small package. Just not an armored car roof.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>High, but since 20 years has passed since this set&#39;s inception it&#39;s gone down a bit. As ever, ebay scalpers want hundreds for it, and bricklink sellers are much more reasonable in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s of dollars. Despite being so few pieces and having a disproportionately high amount of money per piece, it really is worth it due to the huge amount of incredibly useful bricks you can only get in this set, and the just fun nature of the thing. It&#39;s easier to find if you get it imported from overseas, though the money obviously goes way up when you do that due to shipping. I probably wouldn&#39;t spend more than 30 bucks on it but it&#39;s one of the few Lego sets with fewer than a hundred parts that&#39;s genuinely worth that much money. If you can overlook the handful of obvious flaws with it, it&#39;s a great set that&#39;s a lot of fun.</p>
