"Gus_263","2008-06-10T14:45:02.687Z","Good small set","This set was released in the year of 1998, as a part of the Town theme, Extreme team. As a small set, this wasn't very expensive, and of course, this set features few pieces, altough shows a nice building for a small set.

The minifigure included is really simple designed, but is cool, and a nice addition. Like the great part of the other minifigures of the same subtheme, this have a helmet with a black visor and have a black body, The minifigure also have blue coloured arms, and black legs, with few yellow details. At all, this minifigure isn't very hard to find, but is a nice addition to any collection.

The building is also, very easy, but the conclusion is nice. Altough simple, it can increase any other set like hovercrafts or even boats. The bricks and plates that makes the &quot;base&quot; of the vehicle are black, and each side of the vehicle is kept by these, making it very good to play, without dismantle very easy when playing. Each sides of the vehicle are made by small black bricks with different shapes, and increased with red plates. Behind these sides is the place to put the pilot minifigure. The space isn't much long for the minifigure, but have a good space wide, making it useful to increase. On the front, there is a semi triangular brick, and in it's back, there is the direction (altough the minifigure cannot reach it, it is common among town sets, even the cars). The brick on the front have a printed &quot;brand&quot; of the Extreme team. It isn't a problem, because this symbol is cool, and was common during the late 90's years.

In the back, tere are more pieces, with different shapes and white color scheme, making the propeller stay fitted. These pieces don't interfere in the space to the pilot, only increase the set and makes the propeller stay fitted very well. The translucent green circular piece is a nice addition, and makes the design very cool. The propeller piece is common among some of the recent and also old sets, such as in the town or adventurers themes. But a problem can be seen in the sides of the vehicle, there are stickers. But i recommend to not use if you want to use the pieces with other sets. I personally don't like stickers, these affects parts of ever own creation.

Overall, the set don't show much innovations, but have a good building for a small set, and is very playable, and also useful to any creation. If you find this set by a price of a impulse set, buy it and you will get a nice, altough simple, set from the late 90's years. So, thi get a 4,7 regarding as a small set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-06-16T07:47:25.89Z","River Racer","This model is just an upgraded or cooler version of previous models such as:
6513 Glade Runner (1993)
2883 Boat (1997)
This doesn't make it a bad thing, it's just not a very new idea.

The boat itself looks excellent in black with red and the neon green fan cover at the back is just a treat. The only flaw this this model is that they took the time to print the X-Treem logo on the front piece, which is awesome, but failed to do the same on the side pieces and gave us STICKERS instead! I hate stickers as they are so easily damaged and wear and are a pain to get replaced.

The mini-fig is dressed in the X-Treem uniform which is also black, with blue sleeves and a blue helmet. His visor and hands are also black making him really look the treat. He also has a yellow life vest.

Overall I feel this model is fantastic for a cheap little model with good colours and aesthetics but those stickers really bug me so I am giving this one a rating of a 5/10 or Average. Without the stickers it would have been a 6/10+ for sure. Still a good model for any water or town fan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-02T10:20:59.187Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Speed Splash Review","This is a good little set to have in any LEGO collection and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on. The only play feature which this set has is that the propeller on the back does sviwel full 360°. I like the design for this little set. The minifig is very nice as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T07:24:30.717Z","Extreme Boating…","This set, like the Glade Runner (6513) looks great as an addition to any beach or marina setting.   A friend of mine even had a jet-ski and Glades boat repair centre in his Lego marina.   

This set is great in appearance, the colour scheme of black and red works a treat, combine this with a ‘go-faster’ neon green surround for the propeller and this is a real winning set.   The skipper sits lower in this craft than the Glade Runner which offers a sleeker, more sportier appearance.   I particularly like the smooth sides of the boat, but could be slippery when wet!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T13:17:46.07Z","It's EXTREME!","<p>Set #6567 Speed Spalsh: LEGO Introduced a lot of little sub-themes in the '90s, we had Res-Q, Divers, Outback, Extreme Team and any number of other sub-themes. Being a budget minded child/young teenager my LEGO shopping and collection tended to be built up by cheap sets from a veritable smorgasboard of themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Speed Splash set is a small motorboat... Or, something like that, it kind of reminds me of those swamp skimmer style boats that people use to explore the Florida Everglades. Stickers are used for some details, but the Extreme Team logo on the sloped black brick was a printed detail. It is a small cheap set from LEGO Town and fairly good value wise for your money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure was a great little dude too. The more I think about these sets the more I wonder why precisely I chose to give them away, but then I recall that storage space was becoming an issue and it was difficult to display all of them when I wanted to put them out on the limited number of shelves I had to display my collections. As far as Sub-Themes go, I think Extreme Team was a pretty good one. If you can get this set for a good price don't hesitate, go for it, it's a worthy little addition to your LEGO Town.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,5
"wander099","2011-01-30T11:06:46.67Z","Simple, but an excellent vehicle","<p>I got this set a long time ago as a gift from my parents.&nbsp; As a result, I no longer have the box and do not recall (if I ever even knew) how much it cost.&nbsp; I assume it was a relatively inexpensive set given that the other sets in the series are larger, this is not a licensed theme, and the piece count is low.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are a single, folded sheet.&nbsp; They are clear and easy to follow.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There aren't really any special parts here.&nbsp; It comes with two stickers and one printed piece.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>With this set you get one minifigure: a blue extreme team member with a life jacket and plain blue helmet.&nbsp; The torso underneath the life jacket has printing on it as well.&nbsp; I think he looks really cool and I remember that he was one of my favourites as a child (though I did prefer the version with the flames on the helmet, which I also had).<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is really easy.&nbsp; There are no difficult or especially technical aspects and with the low number of pieces it does not take long.&nbsp; As such, it is geared more towards the younger children who will be able to build this one on their own or with limited help.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a swamp vehicle (it looks like one of those swamp skimmers) and it is fairly sturdy.&nbsp; The three grey pieces on the bottom cause it to tilt back when set on a flat surface and this makes it look like the real thing when it is pushed along.&nbsp; The only actual functioning part is the propeller on the back which can be manually turned.&nbsp; Finally, the model is fairly sturdy and the minifigure fits easily in the driver's seat.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a pretty good model.&nbsp; I liked the Extreme Team theme and I wish I had more of these old sets.&nbsp; While this model is particularly good for younger builders due to its easy assembly, low piece count, and play value, it could also be good for the older builder who wants to add to a lego city or just enjoys cool looking vehicles.<br></p>",TRUE,4,2,2,5,4
