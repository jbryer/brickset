"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-28T05:03:16.17Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Drag Race Rally Review","This is a cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and we also get a few stickers to put on. This set comes with lot's of stuff like a helicopter, a cart with some tools, two dragsters and a cool looking traffic light. The helicopter has a camera which can sviwel and the blades can spin full 360Â°. The windscreen can be opened very easily as well. The cart has two drawers with some tools in the inside. The dragsters look very cool as well. Both vehicles have the same play features: The engine with the cups can sviwel and the rear wing on the back can be moved as well. I also like the design of the dragsters which LEGO has chosen for those vehicles. I really can't complain about this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
