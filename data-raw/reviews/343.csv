"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-27T14:59:30Z","Take Off","This set is a good one, just like the Red Tiger and Rocket Car because of the extra man that helps out. The chopper looks great in that black and striped colors. I wish the heads could be more interesting but it is really good still. The chopper could have longer blades to make it more realistic but i don't think that is a problem. This is just a good set overall.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There are also supplies like tools and a fuel barrel in this set. I have to say this is the best minifig scale helicopter Lego has ever made. Period.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
