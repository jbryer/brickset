The sled is fun, like the color and the attention to detail. The trailer is really cool, you lift off the top to find tools you need on your artic mission. The iceberg is OK, the real bonus is the extra explorer. If you have this set and 6520 Mobile Outpost you can really have a good set up for playablility. The Artic theme is great, I think its about time for something simular to come out again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
