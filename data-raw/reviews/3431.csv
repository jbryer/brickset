"piratetown","2007-08-01T16:19:13.007Z","Invaluable garage doors","Agreed, the fire chiefs car was rather silly, and I never found a use for fire helicopters. The best thing about this set is the garages. I used make these into boat house when I built towns, they're very useful. Also, I dig the grey suited fireman and the windows on the station, wished the fire engine held two men, though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-23T16:12:56.31Z","First fire station","This was the first fire station I got. Eventually, the pieces scattered everywhere and were used for other things. The newest fire station (7945) from 2007 replaced this old one. But the old one was great while it lasted.

Pros:

Cons:

-There should've been stuff on the first floor of the building
-Fire car is a convertable! There is no time for relaxing and feeling the wind in your hair when there arepeople in peril! In other words, there should've been a roof

Overall great set for its day, although I would recommend 7945 over this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
