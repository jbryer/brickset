"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-11T01:41:17.187Z","Pleasantly surprised","I actually enjoyed this set, contrary to the other reviews. I have taken apart most of my sets, but can't bring myself to take apart the wind runner witht the sail. I LIKE IT! I like the wheels alot and the way the sail moves forward and backward. It's simple yet well designed. I think it looks better than the picture.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The windrunner actually works if you are on a table or smooth floor and have some hot air blowing behind it. Not a bad set - decent.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-03T08:56:25.42Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Wind Runners Review","<p>This is a nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 12 pages and there're no mistakes in the instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some nice rare pieces: The printed tile with the LEGO Town (Extreme Team) logo and the sail which has some cool printings on it as well. There're also some other cool pieces which can be used for for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very cool, too. The printings on each torso is the same and the legs are the same as well. The only difference we get here are the faces and the headgear: One minifig has a green cap and the other one has a nice blue helmet piece with some cool markings on the top.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p> The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers in this set to worry about.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><br></p><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics//l/6572-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>This set has two vehicles: We get an atv and a vehicle with a sail which you can sviwel. If you compare that vehichle to the one we've seen in the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6734-1"">set 6734</a> (Beach Cruisers) you'll notice that this version is much smaller than the LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts version.</p><p><br></p><p>The atv looks very nice as well. The only play feature on this vehicle is that you can adjust the antenna on the back of the atv. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"burastaro","2010-06-26T12:52:09.7Z","I love this set","<p>It was one of my first sets. </p>
<p>The idea of a sailor vehicle is very good. Follows a simple vehicle that is your competitor. </p>
<p>The minifigure with dark glasses is cool, and black visor of the helmet also.</p>
<p>Very good set.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"wander099","2011-01-30T11:41:55.83Z","Wind-Powered!","<p>Like the only other extreme team set I have, this one was given to me by my parents when I was a child.&nbsp; Therefore, I do not have the box and I do not know how much it cost at the time.&nbsp; However, I do know that this was one of the smaller sets in the set.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>With this set you get one book of instructions for two vehicles.&nbsp; They are straightforward and easy to follow.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>The first thing to note here is that there are no stickers included in this set.&nbsp; Otherwise, the only special parts to be found is one printed piece and of course the sail on the second vehicle.<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two extreme team racers: one blue and one green.&nbsp; They both have the same printed torso and black legs (though the arms are blue and green, respectively).&nbsp; The blue one comes with a blue helmet with flames printed on it (this one was one of my favourites as a child) and the green one has sunglasses printed on his face and comes with a green baseball cap.&nbsp; <br></p><p>I know some people are upset that there was only one helmet included in this set, but it has never bothered me at all.&nbsp; Maybe another helmet would have been nice, but I think the cap looks fine.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is simple and does not take a great deal of time.&nbsp; Younger builders would enjoy this, but may require some assistance with a couple of the steps if they are very young.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Of the completed vehicles, the second is by far the best.&nbsp; The first car you build is a simple car with no features.&nbsp; It does roll when pushed, but not nearly as well as other lego vehicles as it will come to an abrupt stop fairly quickly.</p><p>The second vehicle is the really great part about this set and what I think will be most enjoyed by children.&nbsp; In addition to rolling really well when pushed, it has an adjustable sail that allows it to be moved by wind power.&nbsp; I remember hurrying along the kitchen floor on my hands and knees and blowing this car along.&nbsp; It was great fun.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In short, this set is better for young children than teenagers or adults.&nbsp; It has a high value when it comes to playability and is relatively simple when it comes to building.&nbsp; I recommend this for children; adults and older children would be better of spending money on a more complex set if buying for themselves.<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,4
