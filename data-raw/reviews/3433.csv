"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T19:42:41Z","Pick Up Da' Ice","It is a sheer cold day in the arctics with the blazing plowwer, Overall, this set I would put in the shelf but it is greatvin the winter time. Plus, to cool wack minifigs make the set swell. The only thing that goes into the dump about this set is snowshoes. I bet the real snowshoes don't fall off every second the man walks.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-12-17T11:30:35.013Z","A pretty good Arctic set!","This is a good set. You get the rare Arctic minifig with the blue parka, and a green-suited driver for the plow. I would have rather had a snowmobile as opposed to the small car with the robotic arm, but for 15.00 USD, this was not a bad set at all. Quite a few good elements here, especially the orange pieces, the snowshoes, and the trans-neon-green spider! If you can find it for around the original retail value, I recommend picking it up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-30T18:18:17.84Z","sheer awesomness","There is nothing wrong with this set apart from that it should have come with a lego Polar Bear. The main vehicle looks nice as it has a cool window piece, catterpillar tracks and a snowplough. The extra vehicle is mainly made out of one realy cool piece. I like the colour scheme. and the ice piece looks good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jacobiscool4","2009-04-25T08:56:46.437Z","ok...","this set is ok.there is not really much you can do with it. its not a bad set. just not very good.i guess it would be better if there was a poler bear in it. i like the robot and the fossilized trans green spider.if you just want 2 extra arctic vehicles and a fossilized thing get this set. if you dont want an arctic execory pack,though, dont get this.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-14T11:33:47.333Z","LEGO Town (Arctic) - Arctic Expedition Review","<p>This is a nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 24 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 121 pieces and it was 15 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 12 cents per piece which I think is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has 2 minifigs. One figure has a blue jacket and a blue hood. He also has black pants and on his face we can see black goggles. The other figure has a green cap, a green suit and blue goggles on his face. Both figures also have the LEGO Town (Arctic) logo on the torso which is really nice, too.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers with this set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6573-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set comes with a very nice looking rover and a cool looking dozer. The rover has an arm which you can adjust if you want to pick the translucent blue asteroid up which has a translucent yellow spider in it. The dozer has a very nice looking cockpit and the black pieces on the front can sviwel, too. I really can't complain much about this set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
