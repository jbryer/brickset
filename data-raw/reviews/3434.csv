One neat feature is the helicopter, definetly. I love the neat crane attached to it that can pick up the stretcher and bring it to the base. The one machine with the grabber arm attached can pick up the frozen fossil and bring it to base for examining.
The polar bear, skidoo, and base it self are neat too I might add. A great addition to any LEGO Arctic collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
