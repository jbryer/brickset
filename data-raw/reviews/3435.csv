The snow scooter is weak and so are the pieces. Not worth it to me. And like one of the other reviews said, that orange chasis isn't good for much.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T16:44:07.263Z","Good style for a so much small vehicle","This is one of the smallest sets from the arctic subtheme, part of the town theme. Released in 200, the building don't includes much features, but it still cool due to the design that it makes and also, it have some useful pieces. The minifigure included is included too on other sets from the arctic subtheme and the face is also used on other minifigures of the another town subtheme, the &quot;&quot;. The minifigure is just simple but nice, also in the color. The vehicle is small, builted basically, above a long plate, increased in the sides with two skis and two pieces like buzzsaws. Above it, there is the chassis, good builted, combines some useful pieces in good style and in the front there are some &quot;lights&quot;. On the back, an encurved block makes the minifigure stay very well on it. The building is not much, due to it be a small set, but the pieces are all useful, the set is nicely designed, altough simple, and the playability is basic, but the set is to increase some other sets. In some places it is cheap as it deserves, due to the size and also number of pieces. Another good small set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 21 pieces and it was 2 USD. The price per piece ratio was 10 cents per piece which is a great value for this little model.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has only one minifig. The explorer comes with a green suit, a green hood and the LEGO Town (Arctic) logo on the torso. On his face we can also see some nice goggles.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get only one sticker to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6577-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set may doesn't do anything but it's still fun to maneuver it. On the front we can see two headlights and two skis and on the back we can see a chain saw piece on each side which is supposed to be the tread which I think is a really nice little detail which LEGO has added to this model.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

","This was one of my first Lego sets, Hasn't been built for years now but I still have almost all the parts (and the mini figure) so I can still do a decant review :)<div><br></div><div><b>Parts</b></div><div>The main part is the orange bit, Its good for making MOCs but it can be a bit hard to make a 'realistic' thing with it. The Ice picks are make very good axes for your Star Wars bounty hunter, medieval warrior or Spider Man villain. The skis were quite rare at the time I believe, and haven't (to the best of my Knowledge) been reproduced until the now&nbsp;collectable mini figure 'Skier' but somehow I have never been able to get both of them together for very long...<div><br></div><div><b>Mini Figure</b></div><div>The hat is probably the best bit on the Mini figure, very cool, however I have a hard time finding a use for it. Apart from that not much to say, the torso has the Arctic logo on. The head has some goggles and a rather smug look on the face.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading and I hope it helps. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
"AETerry","2011-01-21T14:58:10.723Z","Snow Scooter Review","<p>I was skeptical of Lego's Arctic theme when it came out... so picking up this set fell in the middle of Impluse, but not really and value for being a small set easy to pick up and see if I liked the theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were some new elements of interest, such as the minifigure with the hood piece so he looks properly bundled up against the weather. A grey saw accessory and the grey snow skiis on this set. It was kindof worth it to get all of those pieces and elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the end, while small, build wasn't all the appealing and I believe it just comes down to in the end, I didn't much care for the Arctic theme like I thought I might. Far easier to focus on Castle and other themes I had several sets to support scenarios and MOCs with.</p>",TRUE,2,3,2,2,3
