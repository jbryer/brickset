"Ovid07","2007-07-11T09:58:08.747Z","Surf's up!","This is a great set for the arctic lineup. It comes with an explorer dude, tools, an outpost and the ice surfer.  The ice surfer is very realistic with handle bars to steer, a cool sail and skis.  Also the color scheme is perfect for it. So I finally decided to rebuild mine (thank you brick factory).  This is a good set, if you have the chance pick one up.    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl_Sagan","2007-12-30T20:20:08.763Z","Cool","TLC combined two designs to make a vehicle that is actually functional while being visually intriguing. the set is based on the adaption of the propulsion system for a wind surfer to an ice sled. The set features many orange pieces, an artic minifig in a green parka, a small contact base, some useful ice tools, and other pieces which can be used in any set. The vehicle is supported by three small skis (one in front, two on the sides) which are spaced widely enough to offer the vehicle exceptional balance while being able to shift up and down based on the surface. Overall this is a very well executed concept accentuated by the use of moving parts to articulate and emphasize the &quot;cool factor&quot;  of this small and exceptional set.

Pros:
-cool minifig
-good pieces
-nice design
-cool flag

Cons:
-even though the small base was probably thrown in there, it is only four pieces

Overall:
this is a cool set as i have already explained. If you see it get it and have fun creating other possible models with the pieces included in this set. 

-Thanks for reading

You get another explorer and a cool vehicle, there was not alot of different sets available in this theme. For the cost of around $5.00 - it was a much needed addition to the collection. The Ice surfer does not roll - you can push it, or blow on it as long as the vehicle is on a slick surface and you are full of alot of hot air.  Good set - great value.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-01T02:20:53.42Z","Getting blown along","Not sure why I originally got this set, possibly a present or something found on clearance. Either way I never really got into this series and this is one of the two models I have from it to date.

Firstly, the vehicle. Well it is kind of a cross between a motorised sled and windsurfer which is cool because when the wind is blowing he can travel using natural power. The sail is on two joints so it can be positioned in allot of ways and the sleds the vehicle sits on are also adjustable to move over the terrain. It is controlled by a handlebar and has a small supply of equipment on the back including a radio and an icepick. 

Secondly, the station. It's four blocks, a baseplate, aerial and computer taking all sorts of readings. Not a necessity but a nice accessory for the model. Also the computer is printed on but the flag has two stickers and I hate stickers.

Third and finally, the mini-fig. He is something different from my normal figs. He has green pants, with a black belt line, Green hoodie with the Arctic logo on the front and a green hood with white fur around the face. He really looks the part. His face is blue sports glasses and a smile, which looks cool.

The models only downfall is lack of another, or playability. A polar bear or a penguin would have been an excellent way to build this up.

Overall it's a well thought out model. The colour scheme is different but acceptable to the environment. It's a different way to get around and while being a little abstract it comes through nicely. The playability is average but with the right model could be very good. I feel this model is a 6/10 because you can see the design that went into it but what to do with it is another thing. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different to add to their collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-18T22:46:00.873Z","i love it!","this is a great set. it comes with a sail which makes it stand out among other sets. the sail can actually work if you have enough air. the figure is cool with his hood and glasses. there is a radio and an ice pick near a really cool piece on the back. also i like how the skiis are held on by mego phones which is really creative. the instructions show real arctic things in them and i like that. the out post has a marker flag and a computer. i also used the sail once to build an arctic wind surfer. that water must be freezing. its a great set and you should get it. its really worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-15T11:19:22.543Z","LEGO Town (Arctic) - Ice Surfer Review","<p>This is a very nice little set to have and it's a fun set to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 43 pieces and it was 5 USD when it came out. That means that this model had a price per piece ratio of 12 cents per piece which is a really nice value for this little set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set only has one minifig. The explorer comes with a green uniform, a green hood, the LEGO Town (Arctic) logo on the torso and some goggles on the face.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get two stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6579-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The set comes with a snowmobile and a little outpost. The outpost has a nice dashboard with a cool looking flag on the top which has the two stickers. The vehicle itself has a very nice design. Even if this snowmobile doesn't do much it's still very easy to maneuver it. The only play feature we get is that you can adjust the sail.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"turtlestack","2016-02-06T20:03:13.497Z","Goes great with the latest Arctic series","<p>I bought this set off of eBay because I felt it would go nicely with the 2014 Arctic series and I was not disappointed. Though the set is very simple and builds like a nearly 20 year-old set, its simplicity actually fits in well with the latest Arctic theme and looks very nice displayed with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30310-1/Arctic-Scout"">30310:&nbsp;Arctic Scout</a>. The sail is nicely designed and though it has the old Arctic logo&nbsp;it&#39;s a good looking&nbsp;piece and the addition of the #79 mile marker / computer terminal adds an extra bit of flair to the overall set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of all the other original Arctic series sets this is the only one I felt is not dated and actually looks like an actual Ice Surfer - all the other original Arctic series sets look, to me anyway, unrealistic and have not aged well. Even by itself this is still a nice little set that would look good all on its own so I would defiantly recommend this litte guy.</p>

<p>The current&nbsp;price I paid&nbsp;on eBay for this complete set (unopened box) was a little over $20 so it&#39;s still a decent deal. There were few unopened box sets,&nbsp;most were used and without a box meaning you could get this even cheaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recommended!</p>
