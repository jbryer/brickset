<p>The first adventure was distinguishing between the dark brown and the red in the instruction booklet.&nbsp; This is not Lego&#39;s fault for I am red / green colour-blind.&nbsp; So my challenge is that the tone of the two colours appear&nbsp;very similar to me.&nbsp; It was also a challenge to see where pieces were placed while building.&nbsp; But I will be honest with you, it was a very straightforward and enjoyable build for me.&nbsp; I got my wife to help me with the colours!<br />
<br />
The base is sturdy and easy to put together.&nbsp; The off-centre action on the ride works perfectly.&nbsp; I love the little pirate ship with its windows and cannons.&nbsp; The mini-fig comes with a pirate&#39;s hat, and two styles of hair increasing its playability.<br />
<br />
The second adventure was the mast of the ship.&nbsp; The mast, while very sturdy for its height, spun around as the ship was&nbsp;riding on the waves.&nbsp; This resulted in the mini-fig being hit in the head with the sails.&nbsp; To fix this I replaced the mast that came with the set with three round single dark&nbsp; brown bricks.&nbsp; While not quite as sturdy as the set build, it stopped the mast from spinning.</p>

<p>So I recommend this build for pirate fans and others.<br />
(This is my first review, so I&#39;m new at this.&nbsp; Thanks.)</p>
