<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently unearthed some printed Extreme team pieces, and seeing how I owned quite a few sets in the theme, (courtesy of a then S@H special package of the majority of&nbsp;E-Team sets for USD$99.99) I decided to rebuild and set&nbsp;some scenes&nbsp;up for a couple of shots. My first rebuild was this set, and seeing it wasn't reviewed I just knew I had to do so. There shall be no unreviewed sets&nbsp;on Brickset!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a kid I loved Extreme Team.&nbsp;Good looking dudes (matching color themes just kill, kids bite it all&nbsp;the time.) and sleek&nbsp;Mach-speed vehicle were just too cool to pass up. However, now as an AFOL,&nbsp;the minifig affection has worn off, and it hit me: these sets have nowhere to go in my collection. Although released under Town, these vehicles&nbsp;would have an extremely hard time fitting into your everyday City. I think that's a big reason why the theme seems to have little market nowadays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned before, cool&nbsp;minifigures. You can never have too many Octan employees in your city, and&nbsp;it's and upgrade over the old boring Octan sign slapped&nbsp;right in the middle of a white tee. The extremist's helmet is printed. His head has white bangs, which rule, they&nbsp;make everyone look cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trans-light blue glass is always nifty to have on hand, and they are quite rare nowadays. The designs are all stickers, good thing they are all only on one piece. You get some good jet/airplane building pieces, and a bunch of fire pieces. Good if you're into making aerial vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jet is 4-stud wide, therefore limited build up front. A hidden wheel rests inside the hollow base.&nbsp;The steering wheel and driver's seat is cool as it's made to bend back to counter the speed this thing goes at (I suppose). The ""wings"" of the jet are built on a flat piece that is stacked horizontally on the mainframe. They also carry the technic wheels. The spoiler-like pieces rest on the back accelerator, which have flames blowing out. I have to say this build is detailed, runs a good color scheme throughout, and pretty much fits what I think a ""Land Jet"" would look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just one racer, so I would say very little. It's thoughtful though, that they threw in another minifig and some tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set should only appeal to the hardcore racing/vehicle subtheme fan. If it's going for around it's original price and you have some extra dough, you can nab it for some useful MOC parts. Otherwise I don't see the need to list this under ""must buy"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a stand-alone set, or theme for that matter, I wouldn't say Extreme Team is completely useless. They look okay when placed next to each other. However, they are definitely too flashy for your City, and other Lego&nbsp;Racers-themed sets pale in&nbsp;comparision to the horsepower these&nbsp;cars are equipped with. So&nbsp;unless you plan on&nbsp;having a very unorthodox racing match, you should steer clear of these sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,2,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-03T09:10:25.407Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Land Jet 7 Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and a fun set to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and therere no mistakes in it. On the back of the instruction you can also see two other models which you can make with the pieces of this set.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has lot's of good pieces in it. We get some nice tools, a nice looking windscreen piece, a hinge which you can use for the windscreen piece and a lot more which are also great for future MOC's (My own creations) and or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs are very cool. We get a cool looking engineer who has a cool green overall and a white cap. The driver has the same torso which most of the LEGO Town (Extreme Team) minifigs have. This figure also has a blue helmet with some nice markings on it.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to worry about.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics//l/6580-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p>This set comes with a rack where you can see two flags and some nice tools. The main attraction is the vehicle: The windscreen can be opened very easily and the driver fits in very nice as well. Before you're able to put the minifig in, you'll have to move the steering-wheel up. On the back you can see a cool engine design with lot's of flame pieces. On the top is a wing which you can sviwel as well. I really like the design of this model.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
