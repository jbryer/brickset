<p>This ornament set can/could be purchased from the LEGO Shop VIP bonus center&nbsp;during the Christmas period of 2022. I paid 1200 VIP points for the set.</p>

<h3>Content and Use</h3>

<p>The ornament is a garland / bunting banner. It consists of a string of 160 cm length with 13 attachments. The attachments are LEGO related shapes or figures&nbsp;made from a resilient paper material.&nbsp;The figures are surprisingly large measuring&nbsp;between 10 and 25 cm in height.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;figures are only printed on one side. This makes it necessary to hang the garland on a wall, cupboard or similar where only the front is visible.</p>

<p>The order and position of the figures may be swapped around to match your taste.</p>

<h3>Delivery</h3>

<p>The Holiday Bunting set is delivered in a bag and not a box meaning it is probably wise to find a sturdy box for storage&nbsp;between Christmas seasons in order to protect the bendable paper figures.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, I think the set is good value for the VIP points spent. The garland&nbsp;looks very nice and is a colourful and decorative ornament to put up next to your other Christmas decorations.</p>
