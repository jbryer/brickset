"zinkk757","2006-12-11T11:52:08Z","cool set","this set was purchased by me when i was about 7 years old.  This set is really cool (most because of the articulated truck) i beleive this might be one of the best construction sets ever made
ups: cool vehicles/ nice tires for truck
downs: little digger a bit too small",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-10T13:25:43.513Z","Construction Crew","This set is the only set from 1996 that actually has a digger in it therefore it makes it a good set. The digger has very convinient portable design. Dumper truck is very big compared to the dumper truck from 1995 and it can carry a lot of cargo. The road sign is cool. Two minifigures are nice for this kind of set. This set should have came with shovel and broom like the 1995 dumper set. This is great construction crew set. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"canbayram","2017-11-01T08:00:36.917Z","Nice Articulated truck and digger set","<p>This set was given as a promotion from a newspaper back in the year it was released. I collected the tiny polybags throughout the month to have this set complete. I remember those days. Also this set was important to me because it had my first Technic related pieces although they were just axles, spacers and wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The digger has 3 joints on the arm and it sits on a turntable so it has quite an action!</p>

<p>The truck is articulated and the dumper works. The roof even has a sunroof to keep the heat out in those hot days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The worker minifigs&nbsp;in blue suits are also nice looking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simple build, yet fun to play with. Also the build is quite sturdy.&nbsp;</p>
