The Daeredevil itself is the best part of the set, and the coolest loking jet in Lego. The stupid looking Octan Man should be kicked out of the set, and thrown in dump because he is not Extreme Team Classified. The helicopter is nice but flemsy and weak. The set is one of the best around!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The top of the plane hinges open to reveal the engine/ray gun? The helicopter is different from any other copter in my collection it is built tough and fun to play with. My favorite is the 6 wheels truck and the gas trailor. All three mini figures are detail and different. This set has alot of playability and is a great addition to any town or city collector. Recommend this set, orig retail on this set was $29.99 - you get alot for your money with this set, one of my all time favorites.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
