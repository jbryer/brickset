"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-19T14:09:01.077Z","A Good All Around Set","This set is good for much that people look for in a LEGO set. It has good functions, nice vehicles, several minifigs, cool pieces, and a nice build. 

Functions: The functions are very cool, not unique, but cool. You have a simple mechanism where you push a rock, and the pieces resting on top of it come tumbling down. There is also a trapdoor in the tent. Move the barrel on the side, and the trapdoor opens. Push the barrel back, and it closes. Why theres a trapdoor in a tent, I have no idea. There is also a zipline, which is alot of fun to play with. The last function is the bridge. Not only is it attached to a horizontal rotating piece on one end, and a vertical rotating piece on the other, but the bridge itself is held together by green vine/rope pieces. Loads of fun.

Vehicles/Minifigs: This set comes with four minifgures with four different colors: white, red, blue, and green. They each feature a unique face (and helmet?). Good for collecting Ex-Team minifigs. There are also numerous vehicles. Two are basic, one being a one piece raft, the other being a few piece buggy. The other two are fun to build and play with. There is the monster truck, which comes with those nifty wheel and pipe pieces, and there is the buggy you see on the bridge in the picture. This one is unique because it has a shock system, springs loaded into the pieces you put the wheels on (you can sorta see it if you look at the pic)

Cool pieces mentioned are the big wheel, shocks, and pipes. Cool pieces not mentioned are the camera, which wasn't available in a lot of sets at the time, the baseplate, which is really good more some base MOCs, and the tent, which is a nice cloth piece.

Overall, this set is very fun to play with and stage adventures with. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-22T05:12:06.533Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Extreme Team Challenge Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. We get a lot of stuff with this set: We get a motorcycle, an atv, a raft, a truck and the mountains with a camp. The raft has a nice rudder on the back which you can sviwel and the front of the motorcycle can be moved as well. The atv has a nice suspension feature which makes this vehicle much cooler. The headlight is able to sviwel as well. The truck has some cool big tyres and the engine on the front can sviwel as well. On the back you can see an antenna which you can move and there's also a cable. I also like the exhaust pipe pieces on each side of the truck.<br><br>The mountains and the camp look very nice too. There's a nice bridge which you can move and there's also a feature which makes the rocks on the mountain falling on the boat. I also like the baseplate which has some cool markings on it. The tent is made out of a cloth material and there's also a floor inside the tent which can disappear if you move the lever on the back. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Dirac","2014-10-08T19:38:18.78Z","Memories from childhood","<p>This was one of the first bigger sets I got as a kid when I was grown up enough to build them myself according to instructions and not break anything up or mistake things, so I have a great sentiment for it. But the set had also some uncommon or even unique features for its time!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Can&#39;t say much about them as it&#39;s been about 15 years or so since I opened it. But I always enjoyed the construction stage of every new set I got.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The unique parts in this set were the baseplate and cloth tent. The baseplate was really detailed and due to large plain area, easy to dust off. However, it needed some caution to carry it without the other elements built onto it that would act as a strengthening element as it would easily bend and possibly break on the weakest, river section. The tent from material was a nice addition, but it sometimes didn&#39;t stay in place tightly - I usually used some clips taken from other sets that would attach to the white joints and press the tent to its foundation.</p>

<p>Also the back pipes of the monster truck are neat. The set contains a camera which was quite rare back then. The planks on the bridge deserve a mention here too, they look very well with those decals and can be used for many other rearrangments.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set contains all the characters from Extreme Team, each with unique coloured&nbsp;kit and unique face. There are also helmets as well as caps for every member, which can be used depending on the situation.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The only hard part was inserting the monster tires on the wheels, especially as a kid, needed some exercise for those tiny fingers back then. It&#39;s worth noting here that the tires are made of very solid rubber and they still didn&#39;t decay/tore as I dug up this set recently, despite heavy play back in the day.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model has some nice gameplay features. The rope that is attached to the monster truck can be anchored on the top of the mountain, then when tightened, a minifigure can slide down on it using that rolling equipment piece. The rubber boat can trip a mechanism that will drop some rocks onto it. The bridge has vertical hinge on one side and horizontal hinge on the other, so it will twist and bend when the quad bike with suppressed wheels passes by, as it is attached to flexible liana elements. Also there is a lever that can open a trapdoor under the tent, which provides easy access to the elements put inside - the redundant caps or helmets for minifigures can be stored inside as well as the snake that would be a surprise for the adventurers!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set has a lot of options to play with - 4 vehicles and the canyon itself. The campfire, bird and camera near the tent add a cozy feeling to it and can serve as a relief for the extreme team. Other activities include mountain climbing and exploring. It was my favourite&nbsp;set back in the day, I have honestly no idea about today&#39;s standards so it might be disappointing&nbsp;for the kids, but collectors in their twenties or thirties will look at it with nostalgia.</p>
