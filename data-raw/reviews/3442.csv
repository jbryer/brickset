This particular model is a simple one. The hand glider is of good size, two large wings or 125mm in wingspan. Has a neat little fan at the back to keep him airborne and two rods for aerodynamics. The handle bar is made from flexi-hose so it shapes to the mini-figs grip very well.

The mini-fig itself is dressed in green and black which looks very nice and has the blue sports sunglasses face. Also has the x-trem logo on the front and back of his jacket.

Overall this model is quite aesthetically pleasing and deserves a 5/10. Looks good on display or fits in well with any town or the Res-q or X-trem series.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-25T10:14:31.417Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Hang-Glider Review","This is a fun little set to have and it's nice to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. The only play feature we get is that the propeller on the back is able to sviwel full 360Â°. On the bottom of the glider is a handle where you can put the minifig on. This set is very easy to maneuver as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun little set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
