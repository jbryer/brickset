Pros:
* Polar Bear
* Ski design is cool
* little trailer 
Cons:
* Should include more features and details on the ski

Other than that this set is great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T17:02:14.187Z","Polar Scout ","This set isn't small, but due to the building, it looks like to be basic, altough is also cool. Released in 2000, the set is good in design, color scheme and too in playability. The minifigure included is the same of some other arctic subtheme minifigures, but with a different color scheme, this have some blue. The design of the minifigure still simple and nice. The set includes also some itens to the minifigure, carried on a small cart on the back of the vehicle. The polar bear included is good detailed and also coloured, altough the color is unic, this is correct. The shape is too good but it is not playable. The set also have a ice meteor with a orange scorpion that stays inside it. The vehicle is basic builted and have a good size for it. The base is a plat, that under have a long ski on each side. Above, there are some orange blocks making the chassis and also are some blue pieces increasing the back and the place that the pilot stay. The front is icreased with some triangular pieces and also with a blue, on a good position, used as a glass. The pilot stay very well in it. The back have also some plates with different shapes to connect the vehicle to the small cart, builted basically with a small ski on each side, under a plate that have above, some blocks increasung it to carry the itens included. Altough the building is basic, the pieces are useful and the plyability is so much good, making it better. The design and color scheme are awesome and so, this set is good in overall. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 12 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 56 pieces. I don't really know how much it was when it was on sale but I think this model is worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set only has one minifig. The explorer has a black suit with the LEGO Town (Arctic) logo and he also has a black hood and black gloves. He also has blue arms and legs and on his face we can see some very nice goggles.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p><span>The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.<br></span></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6586-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a very nice snowmobile which has a nice looking trailer. The trailer can be removed very nice and easy from the snowmobile and you can also open it and put some accessories in there. The vehicle itself doesn't really have many play features but it looks good and it's very easy to maneuver it as well. We also get a polar bear and a translucent blue asteroid with a translucent orange scorpion with this set.<br></span></p>
