"benners30","2007-10-20T11:07:46.967Z","classic","this is a great set and is priceless to own. it has 2 mini figs with plain old smily face but the women has new hair! the camper-trailer can open up for playability and has lots of cool windows and a little table and a sort of sink thing. the car is probably the best car ever produced with a nice color of blue and again more cool window pieces. great set 3 cheers for lego.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"adik_sa_lego","2007-11-19T19:29:59.687Z","very unique","had this one when i was 5 or 6, too bad i was too young to really take care of it. i really enjoyed making and playing this set, cool minifigs, cool classes, nice opening mechanism for the camper.

planning to rebuild this one in the near future, just need to order my missing pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mstrandbo","2010-02-22T07:05:08.043Z","Classic","A great set from the late eighties.
It was my favourite when I was young, really enjoyed to play with it and I recently build it again.
It is also pretty detailed, the trailer comes with a faucet and two cups. The car features a wind deflector/spoiler.
A must-have in any lego city.",FALSE,5,3,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-02-06T11:43:15.613Z","Vacation Camper","<p>This has always been a fun set. I think it was about $10 back in the 80's when I got it. Granted that was a parent who picked that up for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with 2 minifigures, great for having civilians to populate a Lego City with. There'a blue car and then a coup-link that allows for hauling the&nbsp;camper around on back. The camper has some good details too wtih faucet and cups inside and ""jack"" to put down so the car can be unhooked and drive around on it's own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good little set to have around and add character to a Lego City/Town.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"James83","2012-07-17T16:55:34.397Z","Gone Camping!","<p>I remember getting this set when I was young, probably a summer holiday present. I was hooked from the very start (no pun intended). This is another unique 1980s set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The caravan looks great, it does actually look like the caravans of that era. It's not hard to imagine some great holiday times. The vent brick is an excellent&nbsp;representation of the calor gas stowage found in the front&nbsp;of most caravans.&nbsp;The tow bar is nicely integrated and the red and white colour scheme is well thought out. There are extensive windows, a double-wheel chassis and the roof opens up to allow access. Inside there is a basic 2x2 cube table, tap and two clear mugs. There is ample room for Mr and Mrs Brick to sit and enjoy their rainy weekend. Of course they can't sleep in it but you can't have everything! </p><p>The car is pretty unique too and is unlike most other standard town cars of the period. It represents a nice estate car but has the added racy feature of a spoiler. Perhaps a bit odd for a car meant to tow a caravan about! The front looks good with those low-set lights and grill and the white bricks under the doors also add a sporty touch. A very nice little car to own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>This couple comprise&nbsp;one male with&nbsp;red sweater and red trouser with baseball cap and one female with a stripy top and white trousers. Of course if you fancy a swap you can change the headgear over.&nbsp;A grey suitcase is also included. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>This set stayed intact for a long time. It is very sturdy and comprises two very well thought-out parts and has hours of play in it. Yes, it lacks the surfboards and bicycles of later holiday sets but imagination can overcome that. The car alone fits well into any town but the caravan offers you the chance to leave the big city behind and head into the hills.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
