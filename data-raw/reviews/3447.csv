"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-28T03:38:34Z","Why has no one reviewed this?","This set is a classic from the late 80s to early 90s range.
As most of my older (pre-1996) sets it isn't assembled now, but I've still all pieces.
The house is a small vacation house with really realistic look for it's age.
The interior consists of a lamp and a bench or is that a bed? Too bad there's not enough room to sleep for the two minifigs. The minifigures are both good old classic smiley grins. The garden of the house is open to the street and has some flowers, a outdoor barbeque and a tree. There's even a bicycle and a letter piece included. It would've been better if it has more space, but still it's a 
nice 9/10 to me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"villicus","2008-04-18T11:31:43.717Z","Another little gem","Got this house long after my regular lego time. Its a nice set, i love the detailed BBQ with coals on it, a nice detail. Those sets improve your city a lot, its really a shame that those simple living houses were not published for some years. When i was a lego child, every year a new townhouse was in the catalogues so you had the possibility to let your city grow. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The house is half open and very cosy, al be it small. But that doesn't matter, the two minifigs make a cute couple (and ""green"" as well, since they don't have a car, haha)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
- minifigs<br>- baseplate<br>- tree and flowers<br>- items<br><br>
<h4>Cons</h4>
- too small<br>- too colorful<br><br>
<p>In fact no question the rent for this house is low, but there is anything you need to survive in Legoland. I built a few more of them otherwise it looks weird if this house stands alone in your town, so I would say it's not a must have for your collection.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
"Wipipi","2017-06-20T03:15:47.917Z","Nice and Cozy!","<p>I just recently got this set for my town. My friend found out that my sister had her own Lego house in my town and he wanted one too, so naturally, I purchased one that fit his personality. I really think this set is great. Nice figures, nice scenery, nice bed and it even comes with a grill! This is the only house&nbsp;that I can remember that comes with a grill. Now here are the pros and cons.</p>

<p><strong>-Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Nice little cottage.</li>
	<li>Nice figures.</li>
	<li>Easy to build together.</li>
	<li>Really cozy!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>-Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Some people may not like how small this house is. I have trouble putting figures on the bed!&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It comes with a chimney when there isn&#39;t even a fireplace or oven to go with it! Strange..</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. Although, I do think it doesn&#39;t really fit in the main part of town. That is why I am putting it in a little forest that I will make. My score is 8/10!</p>

"omnius","2019-03-30T00:50:30.87Z","A great little getaway","<p>Now a mainstay of the Creator line, for many years houses were a key part of Town. While they varied in size and style, this was easily the smallest of the entire range, representing a bungalow&nbsp;that fits on a 16x16 baseplate.</p>

<p>Despite the small size, a lot of detail is squeezed in. Externally the house has a small number by the door, and an outside light lends it a little extra coziness. Inside is a table with a lamp, another light in the ceiling, and a single bed - a bit of a squeeze for two minifigures! Outside there is a tree, some flowers, a small fence and a barbeque. There is a good selection of minifigures for such a small set, consisting of a man and a woman, along with a bicycle for them to get around.</p>

<p>A lot of character has been packed into this small set, and it represents a perfectly idyllic weekend away for any hard-working minifigures! This charming set is a worthy addition to a town, country or beach scene.</p>
