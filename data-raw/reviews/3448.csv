But, it is a nice, fairly ordinary truck design.  It would be nice if the truck were a little larger and more realistic in  looks and came with outriggers.  I have rebuilt it as such in my own collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Lady down the street was getting rid of some of her sons old LEGO sets and asked if I wanted to buy some - I said YES. This set was one of them, all from the late 80's and early 90's. There were instructions and a big box of assorted blocks. It took me quite awhile to sort through the box and build the sets. It was alot of fun for me but took a month or so. Back to this truck, it was the very first Extention ladder truck to my collection, I have since add some others. I like the simplicity of the older sets, but the do lack the detail and scale of the newer City sets now available. Good set if you can come across it-even if it dosen't quite fit with the newer fire fighting line up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
