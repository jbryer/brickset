"miies","2006-09-07T17:38:56Z","Nice","Octan provided a lot of people with their very first green Lego pieces, this truck is no exception. A nice truck from the days when all cars and trucks were 4 studs wide. The design is good, it looks great driving through your Lego town. A perfect addition to any town, harbor, gas station, etc.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jd5775","2007-08-25T23:46:58.143Z","A classic","This, along with 4537 were my first octan sets.  I remember picking it up at a store in a damaged box in 1994 or 1995.  The cab is good, and reminds me of the one in 6542.  The trailer is also good, complete with a hose and computer screen.  Also provided some rather uncommon (at the time) grey wheels so characteristic to octan sets.  Anyway 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Elle82","2008-01-01T18:55:25.967Z","Lovely","Lovely little set, nothing like this little truck to bring in the fuel supplies. Simple design, but still well thought out. Goes well with Octan service station, not as good looking as 1252 though, but for its age its a nice truck",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-03-23T01:49:05.067Z","Best Lego Truck on it's time","I think this set is the best gas tank that Lego ever launched before they launched the 3180 Tank Truck on 2010. So, this set is really ahead of it's time. Launched in 1992, but it has a really cool detailing. Even though it only use regular bricks, plates, and slopes for the tanker, but it feel as true as the real gas truck.<br><br>What I like about the set :<br>- Lego really put details on this set. For example, look at the side of the tanker body. they have a computerized gas disposal. Really cool:P! Another example is the top side of the tanker. They put three red round plate 2x2, making the tanker really realistic.<br><br>What I dont like about the set :<br>- 4 stud wide vehicle. It doesn't seem right to have a vehicle with only one seat in the centre, while the actual cars definitely have two seats side by side.<br>- Stickers. Once again, the use of stickers ruin this set a bit. And putting a stickers across two parts is really unacceptable.<br><br>In the end, I recommend this set for you guys that want to have a classical looking gas station. I think this set will be really fit in your sub urban area of your city.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"stevekatkus","2009-12-25T04:36:29.03Z","One of my first sets","I have to say, this opened my eyes to explore many creations from this set. This set included a great assortment of unique pieces to create many variations of tandem axle style boogie trucks and others in semi-truck configurations. 
The only drawback, is the darn stickers, they got in the way when disassembling the set, as they over lapped many individual pieces.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HaulingBricks","2023-04-03T20:34:54.707Z","Gas Transit 6594 Review","<p>Gas Transit 6594 was my first LEGO set as a child, but I am reviewing it as an adult now.&nbsp; Firstly, let me start by saying this set was ahead of its time.&nbsp; This was one of the first Octan sets to launch when LEGO began using Octan instead of Shell in 1992.&nbsp; &nbsp;The playability with this set is great.&nbsp; You have the truck with a droppable trailer, the Minifigure and, of course, the trailer with the fuel hose.&nbsp; Given the amount of vehicles in a typical LEGO layout, this is a very handy vehicle to have.</p>

<p>As fas as the build goes, this is a 31-year-old set and it shows.&nbsp; The part usage and selection is impressive, given the time the set was designed.&nbsp; Nowadays, a City set would blow this away but in 1992 this was the best truck in my collection.&nbsp; It is a very simple, straightforward build consisting of only 124 pieces, but LEGO made all 124 of them count.</p>

<p>The vehicle stats together well for display or playtime.&nbsp; My only concern was the decision to apply a clear sticker over two bricks on both sides of the trailer.&nbsp; I am not a fan of this.<br />
<br />
Overall, this isn&#39;t the best set ever, but it&nbsp;is still&nbsp;a great set.&nbsp; I only really see people chasing nostalgia tracking down at this point.&nbsp; Gas Transit 6594 is&nbsp;a gem from a forgotten time and worth having in your collection.</p>
