"Widdi","2007-03-26T09:12:34.73Z","Nice little addition","I got this some years back on a vacation in South Tyrol, Italy. The small village toy shop had just one left. The model is quite simple, just a little surf shop with some kind of a snack bar. It comes with 3 surfboards, that are now shattered with some more in my 75000-piece collection. The Build is simple and straightforward, due to the wall pieces, but it's not juniorised anyway. And I like the minifigs. They are very detailed considering the time of release. Just shortly after the period, when Smilie-Faces were the only faces in Lego sets. 4/5* for this little early 90s-gem.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The bar is also a nice feature because Lego doesn't make bars which is very cool. This is a great set and should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This model is an open beachside cafe, it features a soda fountain, a rack for the surfboards and windsurfing sails and that's about it. It's a great little addition to LEGO Town's beach though, the Mini-Figures are fairly standard from that era with the shades wearing dark haired surfer, the red haired woman with the hot little red dress number and the mustached proprieter of the surf shack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a sticker included in this set to give the detailed sign of the Surf Shack, it also had three life jacket accessories for the trio of Mini-Figures. Overall I'd have to say that this set was worth the price of it back in the day. And I'm glad that it's my 140th review on Brickset, I recommend this to anyone looking to build up some beach property for LEGO City/Town.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
