"zinkk757","2006-12-16T12:20:25Z","love this set","i got this by accident at walmart 8 years ago.  i wanted something else but i lucked out and ended up geting this instead.  and wow did i make the right decision.  this has one of my favorite city sets.  the figure is cool and the boat is to scale with the figure and the truck unloike the other boats around 1995.  the trailer is awesome and looks good with the boat.  the truck could be a bit bigger but all the same the truck is awesome as well i only like to get the sets that really matter and this is a perfect example of a perfect set. what more can you ask for.
cons: another figure would be better in my opinion  
overall: 9  this set is the bomb and  you should definetely get it. there are a bunch of 10 dollar auctions on bricklink.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

We solve that by swapping, putting him on our town pump, and substituting one in with a leather/sport jacket. Then this minifig becomes more useful. Other than that, it's a classic.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T05:56:53.683Z","The Jeep, The Trailer, The Boat, it’s a Great Package…","This was a fairly new addition to my collection, but I am glad I found it.   The colour scheme is nice and simple (black and red) and continues through from the jeep to the boat.   The trailer is a utilitarian grey colour with quite small wheels and a lowering undercarriage which can keep the trailer upright when disconnected from the jeep.   The jeep has good ground clearance, rugged tyres, roof-mounted spot lights and presumably a CB antenna.   The boat is sporty in appearance with a small cockpit and twin outboard engines which pivot should low water be encountered or servicing be required.   Right at the aft end of the boat is a single fin with gantry attached, which houses absolutely nothing!   I guess this could be furnished with an aerial, spot light, radar dish etc etc.

The provision of a winch on the trailer would have been useful to ease recovery, but this is a minor criticism.   

This set looks great parked up in a marina car park, on the slipway about to launch or even as three separate units, the jeep and trailer stored on land while the skipper enjoys himself in the open waters.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"szerman","2009-12-20T15:09:03.623Z","Great set!","This is my first Lego set and one of my favourites. The car is superb. It has nice parts like 2 windows, the doors and smooth lights on his front. I very like the boat too, because it has sports shape and looks. My parents bought this set in 1996 for my 8th birthday. I lost a few parts: the helmet :(, aerials (1 + 1 additional), plate 1x3 and plate 1x4 with wheels holder and the wheels of him. I'm sorry for my English :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
