"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-24T15:19:50Z","The best LEGO airport,ever.","In my opinion this Airport is the best one LEGO ever released.It's a true classic and has the highest piece count of all LEGO Town sets.Even the 6399 has less pieces than this one.
Now where to start on describing all models:
Well the plane is really nice. 
The Cargo Helicopter is very good,but the Minifig tends to slide away in that helicopter.
The smaller helicopter looks good,too.
Only the control tower is ugly as a sin.But te Main Building features a garage,some places to wait and even Lockers for personal things.
Well overall a great set with 850 parts and 12 Minifigs. So there's no juniorisation anyway.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-20T11:15:08.013Z","acopius amounts of awesomenes","this is the greatest airport ever produced by lego! it can be described only by one word- massive. it includes 1 pleasure helicopter, 1 cargo helicopter, a fair sized jet, a huge terminal, and tons of little ground crew things. the jet is 4 wide and has a fair amound of seats and can hinge for playability. the cargo copter is very large with a massive cargo bay with hinging walls and a nice cockpit. the little copter is ok with seating for 1 and a cool cockpit piece. the terminal is terrific. it includes flight time boards a kind of waiting area and more. it also has some radar and a landing pad for the helicopter. it even has a garage for the ground crew trucks1 the airtrafic control tower (atc) is terrific. it rests high up on its own and has a unique set of windows. great set worth the money",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-10-28T16:44:16.45Z","The only airport you need","There are three great things about this set; the plane, the cargo chopper, and the building. The plane has that sleek front, and was designed back when the roof hinged open (unlike some of the newer ones). The cargo chopper was my favorite part, and I remember beefing it up to be even bigger. The building kind of reminds me of the police HQ that came out around the same time, and that is a good thing to me. It meant a lot of bricks and a cool look. The additional little helicopter is nice, along with two other airport vehicles.
It is the control tower that bothers me. Looks like no thought went into it, and you can't do much with those two big bricks. But I guess you need it to make it a real airport.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl_Sagan","2008-05-11T14:29:59.59Z","Why legos are awesome (6597)","I remember it very clearly. I was finished with my final exams, had gotten my grades and had done very well, and was ready for summer. On the first day of summer I wandered into the living room and sat on the couch and stumbled upon my younger brothers new lego magazine. I read through it, thinking of how legos were great as I remember them, and at the same time wondering why I had let go of them. Then I saw this set, and it caught me. Just the picture, with its vivid blend of color made me recall what I had been missing. I ordered the set, a lego set, something I hadn't done for years, and waited. The set came about a week later and when I got it i was at first curious, but then I began to relive a wonderful ritual. Opening the box, taking out packages, instructions, etc. I hadn't even touched a lego for years, I couldn't believe what happened.

The build of the set took one or two hours, not because of complications, but because of my awe. Intricacy yet simplicity left me stunned as i built each and every component. I finished it, set it up similar to the picture, and looked at it. There was a living system before me, the careful consideration of the construction of the buildings and vehicles all intertwined into one set was an awesome display. Multiple vehicles, multiple aircraft, a dozen people, and the clever way of bringing them together in a functioning airport is what lego is all about. I credit this set for getting me back into lego. what an amazing set.

Pros:
functionality of the airport, made possible by:
-cool jet/airplane
-cargo double propeller helicopter
-personal helicopter
-multiple service vehicles
-customers and service people for every role
-tools and suitcases
-six baseplates

Cons:
-that it is not available anymore, what a crime

Bottomline:
-this set got me back into lego, try to compare this set to any other city set and they are at best tied.

feel free to e-mail about any other questions

Thanks for reading,

"arky83mi","2008-10-30T00:46:13.937Z","One of the last great Lego sets","My most treasured set I own, took months for me to save up to buy it way back when. Great private jet and cargo helicopter and terminal. One of the perks is a place to put all the maintenance vehicles included in the set. the only con is the runway (as with all airports). By my estimation the jet is scaled to about 50', and the runway requirement for a jet of that size is almost 3800', which means you would need around 56 runway plates, but who has room for that! But it suits my fleet of almost 30 airplanes just fine! A pricey set nowadays, but a must have! Sadly Lego has really taken a turn in the realistic quality of their sets and I just can't bring myself to buy any...bring back the 90's!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-03-05T00:53:22.593Z","A great airport.","This is the biggest and most audacious of the lego airports.  Whilst it does suffer a bit from pillars rather than individual bricks, that isn't too much of a problem here.  The building is great, comes with a restaurant, garage and luggage compartments.  There's also a control tower and a whole plethora of vehicles including an aeroplane, cargo helicopter, smaller helicopter, refuelling tanker and little vehicles for carrying cargo and stairs to acces the aeroplane.  Some of the staff look like they're into solvent abuse (I think it's actually meant to be freckles) but otherwise a good selection of minifigs.  One of the best town sets of the 1990s and a set no-one's lego town should be without.

"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:50:14.89Z","Best Lego Airport","Most of the Lego airports have been well designed, but I think just overall this is the best one out there.  The tower was a unique element along with the garage dedicated for the luggage truck.  You've got two helicopters and a well designed, sleek airplane on top of everything, employing the latest cockpit piece.  Inside, you have a little lounge and luggage carousel (which later would be employed in the newer airport).

Also, this would be the last airport to have a runway.  The newest airplanes, while allowing for more people (and in a way being more realistic) are far too large for the old style runways.  It's kinda sad because now the planes are just too big for their own good.  I like these old school sets because they're still small enough to easily integrate into your town.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2010-01-25T14:44:00.357Z","A Genius Set by Lego","I got this set years ago for my Birthday. I would agree with the most reviews given by other Users here: this Lego set is truly marvelous. Although You can see many details on the picture above, I must say, that this Airport is much more that just that.

The building is made in Classic Town style (see 6349 or 6380 to see what I mean), with wonderful grey windows and doors. The interior includes two cafes and passport control as well as customs. There is also a flight info board and security storage. And a telephone booth outside.

This set has the most obvious advantage over other Airport Sets (especially the modern ones) - it includes 12 minifigs, the personnel and the passengers, several airport service vehicles (including the red one from 1990s!), an airplane, a helicopter and a large cargo helicopter.

The set has several plates and rare details (e.g. from the Tower, the hangar and others). 

When I was a child I played hours and hours with this set. It's definitely one of the most impressive sets Lego has ever released.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cbowers","2009-11-17T15:28:49.797Z","Best Airport","This is definitely the best airport that Lego has produced to date. The details and play are endless and this really trumps the previous models and the newer ones for the matter. 

The amount of vehicles included help make this set amazing. I wish this one had come out earlier, because I own this one and its predecessor, but this one is much more fun with its jet stairs and ground support. Wish those other ground support vehicles were mass produced. 

I liked these planes better, they were a more challenging build than the new ones and seemed more delicate such as airplanes really are. Oh they also fit on provided baseplates. 

Pros to this set are the amount of pieces and detail and some of the minifigs. Definitely the added garage and the cargo copter. I also like the new cockpit on the airplane, makes it more sleek. Inside details were neat too, such as the lockers and the bag check. 

A few cons but nothing to fret about. The lack of more aiport staff, and the tower being on stilts with no way to reach its top.

"Night_City_Dream","2009-11-12T17:14:43.75Z","You're simply the best!","I got this set in 1995 and I was so excited then that I couldn't find words to describe it.

Surely, 7894 is much more detailed but it is hardly considered as a whole. Just a plane and a single-standing building. However, this set is unique and looks exactly as an airport. Yeah, its much smaller scaled but still the designers managed to make it as detailed as possible on this scale. The plain, the biggest vehicle about the set is only 4 studs wide but it looks wonderful. And it doesn't lack functionality: it can open and store 4 passengers. And it can store briefcases / bags as well. You don't have to disassemble it or a roof to take the minifigs in and out, so it's much better than the planes of 2000s

By the way, the set has 12 minifigs! Now, city sets have 5 at most :( 3 out of 12 minifigs are just passengers! Now airport sets have only one...

The set has a good runway, 3 baseplates, so 75 cm long. For such scale of plane it's not that little.

There are 2 helicopters: one small but nice (and a nice pilot minifig, by the way), the second is large for the 90s, a huge and powerful cargo helicopter that can store 2 containers and the briefcases.

Finally, there are 3 cars: one for carrying luggae and pulling the the ladder (which is not that big but again nice), one as forklift to load the big helicopter and a fuel tanker. All the cars have drivers.

And the building. Not very modern, let's say classical. But still nice. Ut has a cafe (mugs) and a restaurants (wine glasses), it has a nice check-in space, a detecting conveyer etc.

The control tower has a sleek design, it's tall and beautiful. And, there is a palm tree and a stick showing the direction and the speed of the wind.

All this said, I think, it's the best airport set by Lego. However, it can be combined with newer sets to make a huge transport hub!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lolbrick","2009-10-30T14:50:33Z","Old beats new here","This must be the best Airport in Lego to date... I mean the 2006 Remakes relied way too much on special designed parts and was just lazy detailed, even for something that's only 4 studs wide they do package as much realism as possible, the only bad thing for me would be that the Control tower and garage could've been better developed, and slightly more work on the reception, but since it's the best Airport in Lego it's a must if your Lego Airport interested!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legomaniac_jacob","2011-12-25T15:30:32.357Z","The set that started it all","I got this set on the first night of Chanukah when I was about 8 years old.&nbsp; I think my mom found it at Toys R Us or some other store for 50% off at some point, because it was no doubt expensive even at that time.&nbsp; <br><br>This set was definitely one of the greatest sets I ever owned, and it really jumpstarted my lego mania into full gear in the coming years.&nbsp; First off, the set is massive, at least to an 8 year old.&nbsp; Heck, I still think it's massive, and I'm 23 now.&nbsp; The set is very realistic, no details were spared.&nbsp; There are plenty of stickers and logos, suitcases, control panels, working doors, an awesome garage door, flowers, even runway lights.&nbsp; <br><br>The set provided me with countless hours of playability, and I rejoiced in taking constructing it carefully and diligently, admiring its beauty, playing with it, leaving it built for weeks at end, and then every now and then disassembling it back into its box, only to rebuild it again at some later time.&nbsp; <br><br>What I liked most about this set was that, as the years passed and my lego collection expanded across new themes that were released, this set became a staple and focal point of my massive lego display when I had everything built simultaneously.&nbsp; For instance, I loved to connect other baseplates and sets to lengthen the runway, add on the whole wild west village, space monorails, castles, and even have my technic vehicles scattered about.&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn't even matter to me if the scale was all wrong across themes.&nbsp; Century Skyway still proved to be a great starting point.<br><br>I see that Lego may have rereleased this set.&nbsp; I dont know anything about this, but if its true, that would have to be one the best decisions theyve ever made.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
