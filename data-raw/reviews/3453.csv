"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-13T16:50:59Z","Completely Good!","        I got this set some time ago and I still like it! IT looks real great when in a lego town and is a great addition and is a great choice among Police HQs. First, the boat. It is nice and it comes with life jackets and can seat two people. The boat doesnt actually float like a real one but it is easily pretendable. The small, black helicopter is very nice and it is always good to have aircraft in a set! The van is nice and really looks old school. It can fit a lego crook and the driver. The cycles are great. Finally, two wheelers and not the 3 wheeler trikes! The jail is very nice and includes a roomy cell, a watch deck, and a gate. It also has the dock for the boat along with it. It comes with a ton of officers, captains, worker, and a crook! The building is very nice and features a garage for the van, a nice bottomk floor where a guard sits in the check in counter. It also has a coffee maker for tired cops. The second floor holds the commander's room with a city map and a computer, (I added a lamp!). From that room, you can go out on a deck that overlooks the jail and garage. The top floor is where the evidence man resides and where he looks at a cool fingerprint and a real magnifying glass to spare! It holds a cabinet too and cool, slanted windows. This is one of the best police departments and I really urge you to get it, they are quite rare nowadays!

I hate giving perfect scores, since nothing is perfect, but I can&#39;t find anything to dislike about this set. &nbsp;I came across it recently (2013) when reassembling all of my old sets, and it&#39;s just as fun now as it was when I bought it.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: 4</strong><br />
The building experience was pretty good. &nbsp;It&#39;s not very hard to put together, but you can tell even when you&#39;re building it that you&#39;re going to have a lot of fun, just from all the different components and moving parts (gates, doors, prison cot, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 5</strong><br />
I love the parts in this set. &nbsp;There&#39;s plenty of glass, plenty of stickers, plenty of minifigures, lots of little special parts (video camera, computer, money, coffee machine, rotating chairs, flowers), a pretty cool baseplate, and even a shark. &nbsp;Lots of variety and lots of potential.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 5</strong><br />
You&#39;ll have hours of fun with this set. &nbsp;There are so many vehicles (two motorcycles, paddy wagon, boat, helicopter), so many minifigures&nbsp;(eight! - seven cops and a criminal), a great looking station, a fun prison, and even docking areas between the two buildings. &nbsp;Anything you can imagine a police department doing can be done with this set.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: 5</strong><br />
The description says this set retailed for $66 (I think I remember paying closer to $45), but I&#39;d say it&#39;s well worth the money. &nbsp;This is one of my favorite sets out of all the ones I&#39;ve ever owned, and I&#39;d buy it again in a heartbeat. &nbsp;There might be bigger police stations out there, but this packs a lot into its modest size. &nbsp;Definitely recommended for any Lego fan.</p>
