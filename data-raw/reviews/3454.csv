I always loved the set. it's great to play with (not so great if all you do is make a lego city though). It isn't very big which is great and makes it so you can build your own boat to launch it from. It has the hook on top to latch on to it and set it in the &quot;water&quot; and along with the divers it makes a very fun set to play with. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BRICK_101","2008-05-20T00:55:03.013Z","Good set, bad pic","This picture does not do this set justice. It came with one of each type of shark, a dark gray shark, a white shark and a gray swordfish/shark. Great way to stock up on sharks and divers. The little sub is also cool. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"craigpowers","2011-09-10T16:06:15.1Z","Nice ""complimentary"" set to a larger collection","<p>I bought this set, used, for my young son, who is just beginning to build with Legos, so the size of the set was appropriate for his age. &nbsp;But the added incentive, for me, was that this set compliments my older sets and allows for a more dynamic building experience. &nbsp;The 3 different sharks are a nice addition to my Lego marine life figurines, and the submarine blends the city/town themes with the adventure theme nicely. &nbsp;This set features a lot of unique pieces, namely the bubble canopy and diver gear, which are not commonplace on many other sets.</p><p><br></p><p>The set's playability outshines any actual building experience, as the submarine's construction is very basic. &nbsp;However, the set is neither barren, nor garish, and the design is very well thought-out, using each piece to full function, rather than just ""tacked"" on.</p><p><br></p><p>The only real con to this set is the use of stickers. &nbsp;I hope, someday, Lego realizes that stickers are more of a burden than they are worth and either provide painted pieces, instead, or just do away with markings altogether.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
