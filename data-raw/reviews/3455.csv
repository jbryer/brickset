This wasn't that unusual for early minifig sets, but doesn't make it any less frustrating. Of course you can sit him on the front or on the roof (if you remove the blue light). I wonder if this was designed before Lego came up with the steering wheel piece. Probably a good budget buy at the time, but you wouldn't bother now, especially as most people would have all the pieces they need to build it without even having the set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
