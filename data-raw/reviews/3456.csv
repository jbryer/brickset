"Rick76","2005-09-05T14:50:38Z","This is not the best set ever but...","I highly recommend it if you are a Town fan.  I just got this set in an store clearence (they still had it) I was not expecting much because i figure it would be highly juniorized and indeed it was (the cars mainly), but when i finish it and put it along other town sets (including Main Street) i figure it was a great buy because the Highway overpass is something every town needs.. I am not regretful even that is a juniorized set. Buy it if you can.. specially for having the highway pieces.  You just have to remodel some cars (specially the police one) to make them look less juniorized.  I wish Lego releases Highway pieces as individual pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Mine sits in the middle of Tabletown, but is permanently under construction - my trains run underneath it and it's a really good focal point for the city centre.  Would be good to have two of them to create an extended flyover.

First minifigs there are 5 minifigs 4 construction 1 police. There are 3 different minifigs and 1 duplicate. The crane operator has an all orange jumpsuit he also has a somewhat bearded face. The front loader operator has blue pants and a black beard/hair. The other two are the duplicates they both have blue overalls with the same face. The police officer has black pants and a black vest with his police badge on it he has sunglasses and a black cap. There are enough white hard hats for all including the officer. There are a few signs and tools for the minifigs such as a shovel pickaxe blue prints and jack hammer.
There were multiple manuals. First off the overpass this is quick and easy there are three pillars you build in them is some juniorized pieces example there are many 2 by 4 by 3 light grey bricks. The four different road plates fit over these and the road plates can be put into place by the crane. 
The crane is fairly large and it can lift a big load thanks to its big base the string and hook come pre-tied and can be round up on a piece that’s also pre-attached to it. For controls there’s only a wheel. How the worker gets to the top is anybody’s guess as there is no stairs or anything. There are two extra attachments for the crane a shovel that has a spring in it so it closes easily, and a little cement bucket that can turn over to dump some little cylinders into the truck.
There are three vehicles that come with there is a dump truck that can lift its bucket. A front loader was also included. Its scoop can move up and down because of its click hinges, it can load some small grey cylinders into the back of the dump truck. Finally there’s a police detour truck to direct traffic away from the site the sign on the back of the truck moves up and down it has printed parts in fact there are NO stickers in this set at all.
Overall this is an excellent construction set that has many working features although it has lots of juniorization it has a huge playability factor and still looks great in modern Lego towns. 4.5/5

The construction stuff is pretty cool like the crane and the dump truck. This is such a great set that it should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-08-20T16:43:57.577Z","great city addition","I consider this set a classic and actually constructed pretty good itself. I think the bridge will go good with any lego town or city(no matter how big or small). the dump truck works great along with the police patrol car(even comes with caution signs)and the tractor shovel can shovel just fine. It comes with a good amount of minifigures but the crowning achievement is the crane bucket. through chains and pivots, it can be lowered and raised easily great for stashing everything from lego &quot;boulders&quot; to a lego minifigure.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:53:41.937Z","Buy It For the Freeway","This set has some nice construction themed elements like the crane, the dump truck and construction workers.  But the real reason to get this set is the freeway piece.  Up until this point, you'd have to create your own make shift freeway using long flat plates and possibly smooth them over with those smooth plates.  But this set makes that unnecessary.  Unfortunately, for us there has not been many other sets with these freeway elements to expand the freeway parts, which makes this set even more crucial to your collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-08T02:15:52.373Z","Nice bridge, shame about everything else.","When I was little I made my own bridge for my Lego town out of roadplates and books as pillars.  A bridge is a good idea for a town, but it's a shame that Lego never made one in the days before the dumb-down era of the late 1990s started.  Everything about this is over-simplified, from the naff vehicles to the crane.  It looks like a Basic ""3"" set.  Worth getting for the bridge.  You could always sell the rest of this set on e-bay as spare parts or something.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-15T10:14:31.517Z","LEGO Town (City) - Highway Construction Review","This set is may be an easy build but it's lot's of fun to build it and to play with. We got lot's of stuff here like a bridge, a crane a police truck, a front loader and a dump truck. This set will look very well in any LEGO city you're building for sure. The crane is very large and the top can sviwel full 360°. The black bar where you can attach the container on can slide out very easily.<br><br>The other vehicles are very neat as well. The dumper truck has a cool looking grill on the front and the container on the back can sviwel as well. The shovel of the front loader can move up and down and the police truck has a gate on each side which can sviwel and a sign on the back of the truck which you can fold up. I think it's a really great set to have and I can't complain about it. We also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"no_skill","2010-01-09T21:03:10.09Z","Junior, but with some redeeming qualities.","Very much epitomizes Town Junior.  A retail price tag of $80 USD and only 310 elements.  Not surprisingly, it was a poor seller, at least in my area.  I only saw the set begin to move once clearance prices dropped below $30.  The set clearly demonstrates an effort to make something recognizable with as few elements a possible, and comes-off looking cheep and unfinished.

I must say the over-pass plates are neat, however, and at deep clearance prices, I regret not picking up a second set for an additional, or larger, elevated section of highway.  The overall premise was good, but he execution of the set was just so hideous to me, I could only bring myself to buy a single copy at the time, even at a fraction of original MSP.

The dump truck is probably the best vehicle in the bunch.  The dumper is a good element to have.  The scoop truck is, quite frankly, lame.  The traffic blocker is an OK concept, especially after having seen such vehicles more prevalent in non North-American countries.  Again though, execution is minimalist and week.  The crane is useful only for the boom, and I guess the legs, but still comes off looking dumbed-downed and unfinished.

So overall, while there are some worthwhile elements, the overall execution as a packaged compilation misses the mark and falls well shot of average.
