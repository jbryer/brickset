I remember loving this set as a kid and hopefully business is going to be just as good for him in 2011 and beyond.<br>I have him set up as per the front of the box so he can wheel his cart around town and meet the demands of the lunch hour or afternoon rush home near the train station.<br><span><br>Overall a simple little set that I find very charming and a great little 'detail' filler for your city.<br></span>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

Double red taps are set for delivering some whippy ice cream action and with the opening cart top that makes far too much excitement for such a small set. The only lacking thing in this fun little build is some choc ice or ice cream representative bricks- difficult at the time but something would have been good, unless I can not remember whats in the cart?</div><div><br></div><div>I'm sure if the ice cream seller delved in to grab ice cream that my brother's character would steal from the taps and vice versa. This sort of bad minifigure behaviour was typical on our layouts and designed to bait the cops. Stealing ice cream, gulp, may have justified blue lights and sirens!&nbsp;Being goaded to break up such sets was what led to the red and white tiles being worn down - ouch. Try and find a set with a good stripey print.</div><div><br></div><div>So, a really neat little set and an enterprise worth expanding upon with a van.

<p>I was impressed by the detail, the baseball cap, the taps, the parasol, and it was nice to see an ice lolly printed brick to give a link back to my much-loved Snack Bar. Once again this was another small set with just enough brick variety to have a go at making your own designs, but the neatness of the original design means this is the one which lasts. The swivel footstand is a neat touch, and meant that instead of having to run to keep up with the other vehicles on our Lego carpet convoys, the ice cream cart and its proprietor could simply affix themselves on top of the petrol tanker (as one obviously would).</p>
