"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-03T00:00:00Z","","This is a nice set. It comes with Wrench and his Scorpion Buggy from the game Lego Stunt Rally. I am trying to collect all of these so I can make my own Stunt Rally World. The problem is these are rare to find these days in 2003.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-31T17:13:37.293Z","best race car!","I love this set, the car includes an awesome mini figure with a high tech helmet which is great for moc's. The car has working back suspension and lots of neat pieces. The jump is really cool. With the pin in, it's a jump but if you take it out and drive the car over it, it flips down the other way and the car rolls off. This set is pretty detailed and is worth the money for sure. I love this set and highly recommend it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2010-09-20T21:57:45.253Z","A Widely Unappreciated Set... a true jewel of racing!","<p>LEGO Race was a short-lived subtheme of town (and greatly unappreciated too!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Experience: I found this set (about equivalent to today's battle-packs) to be a refreshing build. The Buggy has a very nice tilted design with working suspension (held by rubber bands). The ramp was a very welcome surprise! Not many racing sets today (at the 10 dollar range, anyways) feature a car and scenery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts: This set has a few very nice parts (that are wonderfully printed). A printed slope with a scorpion pattern, and four printed tiles with the word ""Octan"" designed to look as if they've withstood wear and tear. The driver was a very special minifig to me. I instantly recognized him from the (rather poor) racing game Stunt Rally. Wrench, as he's called, comes with a red bandana and a helmet with a very unique visor, last seen in Ice Planet 2002, I believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability: This set is really fun to roll around on the ground. The extra ramp thrown in gives it extra playability: something for the vehicle to interact with. The ramp is held in place by a technic pin, which can be removed to be used as a flippable ramp. I found the dual suspension to be very unique: not something I'd seen before. Kids will find this set to be great fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money: At $10, this set is a steal. At average bricklink price, it's even cheaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: If you're looking for a great LEGO car, look no further. If you're looking for a set that won't break the bank, look no further. If you're looking for a compact set with lots of options (like alternate instructions)... look no further than 6602-2 Scorpion Buggy.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"andy87","2008-11-21T15:52:30.2Z","Ahhh what a nice set","This set is really cool and fast. I still have the mini figure, but the buggy is long since gone. The ramp makes the set great and with endless playability of great fun. The mini figure is really cool and has a scorpion on his shirt. Neat. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-16T10:23:26.357Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Scorpion Buggy Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 12 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some very cool black and red pieces. All of them are very useful for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig is a really nice figure to have. On the torso is a printed scorpion and the driver also has a black helmet and a red visor. The face of this minifig looks very nice as well.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6602-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set is a lot of fun for sure: We get the buggy and a ramp. The ramp does sviwel if you move the lever out. The buggy itself only has one play feature. The only feature we get is that the tyres on the back sviwel. I really like the design of this vehicle.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
