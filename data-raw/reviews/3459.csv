<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of pieces was terribly small, but for the price I'm sure my folks paid for the set, it was well worth it.&nbsp; The only other problem the set had was the stickers for the side of the car. You couldn't take the plates apart because the stickers covered the sides.&nbsp; I think I finally broke down and just ripped the stickers off so I could use the red plates in something else I was creating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I give this a ""BB"" rating. (Two Brick)</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,3
