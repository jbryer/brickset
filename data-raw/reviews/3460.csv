"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T15:18:10Z","My first ever set","This was the first set I ever made. It introduced me to the basics of LEGO and packed a lot of fun. I was only three, but I can assure you, for me this set provided more fun than a toy 8 times its size would have. Why can't LEGO understand that LEGO for juniors does not have to be juniorised and that basic, customisable LEGO sets have an appeal no matter how blocky they are. I'm not saying to LEGO to market a LEGO cube though ;-).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
