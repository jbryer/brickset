"bmwlego","2007-10-26T23:28:31.06Z","At Least it has a Decorated Brick!","Another set that made it through my Dark Age. The minifig is a cool little racer with a classic helmet. The printed slope brick is a nice detail but this car is lacking in realism, size, and detail. It is easy to replicate with other colors but that is because there are so few bricks. The spoiler is way too large for the car but at least it has this detail. Overall a very tiny and disappointing set. (Even for a nostalgic AFOL who grew up in the 80's). ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-06-21T17:23:20.19Z","Formulaic","How to differ reviews between racing cars? Its not too bad, they all have something different to offer in the build. Lets look at this number 1.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A black trousers and top with a white standard helmet. Nothing to remark upon.</span></p><div><div><b>Premier Racer</b></div>This neat little outfit is worn by our driver who here gets another mini Formula 1 racing car. Its bright white with black parts and a little red here and there. A major part here is the up and down offset plate that is handy for sitting drivers low in vehicles so the roof can close on their fat head. I was surprised to see it here on this small, open top racer.</div><div><br></div><div>The white seating plate has the slanted brick front and smart No.1 in red with the black stripes. A steering wheel and two one stud cylinders are added, no problem. Side slant bricks have always been a little wrong for me but are a consistent mini F1 build. A diagonal dart shaped plate sits as the spoiler at the back. Then a mega exhaust is constructed, the wheels added (with grey hubcaps) and including the front spoiler, the car is ready with driver in, to go for it.</div><div><br></div><div>One stud red circle plates 'fire up' the rear exhaust, encouraging arguments that this should/ should not make it faster. It would be funny to see the blue old number 3 win instead. A little formulaic, some of these are take it or leave it but I can see some merit in the slight design change here and accept it could be an early or first set. Apart from a more custom exhaust and engine, it will also no doubt please small F1 fans.</div><div><br></div><div>Another for the starting line, very welcome but where other subthemes lacked variant campervans, caravans, limousines, biplanes and so on, it was not necessary to add on this many extra cars to 'Racing' but it does spoil us for choice. Go pick your favourites.</div><div><br></div><div><b>SET REQUEST</b>: Horse, greyhound, lawnmower, bike, motorbike, camel and dog-sled racing.</div>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,2

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am far more partial to the Sprint Racer set. I think what does this set in for me after you've gotten done building it is the plainness of the Minifigure's torso. And on the car, the spoiler in back seems too high. Otherwise its a decent build and if you're collecting up a bunch of race cars, this is one more for the track.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,3,4
