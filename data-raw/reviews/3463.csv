"T79","2016-05-02T10:06:33.613Z","Sometimes simple is best","<p>When I asked my children to pick one set from all our sets with between 26 and 30 pieces (from 1983&#39;s #6823 Surface Transport to 2005&#39;s #7235 Police Motorcycle) they actually picked #6555 Sea Hunter, but since I already reviewed that I asked them to pick the second best set.&nbsp;To my surprise they picked this one (well, it tied with #7235 but I&#39;m not adding a 44th review there) over other candidates like #6811 Pulsar Charger.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I&nbsp;still&nbsp;have the instructions for this set, a tiny folding sheet with four steps on&nbsp;one side and a picture of the set and an alternative wheelbarrow on the other side. Interestingly, the instructions don&#39;t tell you explicitly to apply the stickers, they just show you&nbsp;the bricks with the stickers already applied.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For the time these were nice parts, nothing very special but the decorated 1 x 4 bricks with red safety stripes are nice. It would have been nicer still if they were printed and had those markings been&nbsp;on both sides but that is probably asking too much. The two white 2 x 2 x 2 cones are still the only ones I have in this colour even though they&#39;re far from rare, if you do not take into account the open stud/closed stud difference.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is one of my favourite minifigures from the old town theme, the blue shirt with red hard hat was always a welcome addition (I never had enough of them to do all the work that needed doing). He comes with a shovel and a pickaxe which doubled our existing stock of both at the time: a shovel from #361 Garage and a pickaxe from #6302 Mini-figure Set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing special here, you&#39;re just stacking some plates on a plate with wheels to create a sort of pushcart and then add traffic cones and fences. Considering the low piece count there&#39;s still a lot of building here though, aside from the minifig all other pieces are used to build (even the tools, as we&#39;ll see).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a very simple (and&nbsp;I mean <em>very</em> simple)&nbsp;cart with the required signage and tools to start tearing up roads. If you want the cart to stay upright without the minifigure holding it you will need to leave at least one tool in its clip, otherwise it will tip over which looks a bit odd if the cones and fences are still on but that is a very minor issue.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even if this is your only construction set it has everything needed to go so it&#39;s no wonder it scored so well with my children. I&#39;m still surprised it came out (almost) on top but that just shows that simple sometimes really is best!</p>
