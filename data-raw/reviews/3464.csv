"legotowner","2011-03-05T23:17:40.323Z","Had all the tools to keep the dust out of town","<p>So small and compact, so yellow, so council, so good.</p>
<p>The worker was well respected for his work, well he did have the tools with the shovel and broom which clicked onto the side of his cart.</p>
<p>I thought the front lights being flat under the steering wheel and engine looked so cool.</p>
<p>This was a perfect liitle cheap option that every town needs.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-09-24T05:27:40.67Z","Cleanest Town Award","Here is a blue capped minifigure - I could not find many others and thats what originally attracted me to this set as a kid.&nbsp;<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>A town worker in black trousers, blue top and a flat blue cap.</li></ul></div><div><b>Done &amp; Dusted</b></div><div>It turned out to be a really good small service vehicle that is colourful and the maintenance worker gets a broom and shovel. Tools and hand gadgets were always much sought after with excitement but are everywhere in modern sets. The red seat was a choice brick and the build was obviously yellow, short but actually satisfying.<div><div><br></div><div>Obviously some sort of battery powered electric cart, it can take maintenance within a small range of the town centre.&nbsp;Possibly among the harder working MFs in Town, he deserves a pub to go to after a hard week and perhaps a mug of tea on the job, every workman should have one!</div><div><br></div><div>These small town character sets add much to a larger town layout and deserve better attention. Imaginatively this is probably an electric cart and a suitable design but the necessity of vehicles in every Town set is questionable.</div><div><br></div><div>Also the necessity of cleaning a town with out dirt raises the need for dirt representative bricks or better still a set that incorporates a real soft brush and vacuum for the one real true enemy of the Lego layout: DUST.</div></div></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,2
"Niki124","2021-02-04T20:28:32.723Z","Great little set","<p>Another of Lego&#39;s pocket-money sets, this proved to be pocket money well spent in my case. There&#39;s always a thrill at finally getting your hands on a long-coveted piece, which for me was the sweeping brush. I also loved the blue peaked cap on the minifigure, and I&#39;ll always love the moulded seat pieces.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many parts so it&#39;s a fairly quick build, but there&#39;s enough to have a go at making up your own designs and then rebuilding the original. And for our all-important carpet convoys, the original design has ample space for a passenger to hop on the back.</p>

<p>This is one of the first sets what I own. I got it on the mid of the &#39;80s. So this has good old memories. The shovel was a long time missing part, steering wheel was broken and the minifigure has no face, till my LEGO love returned and I found the way to replace the parts.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong></p>

<p>Maybe due to the old memories or just the good idea this is a good set to build. Easy way to get the assembly in one peace. The cleaning devices to attach in the middle of the car is a good way to hold the part.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The yellow parts with the red seat is a good idea with the black chassis. Set contains very basic parts.&nbsp;The broom and the shovel is also is a good part of this small set. This set shows&nbsp;how you can build&nbsp;something good from a way simple part.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>From the view of the few basic bricks of this set you can build various things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the other hand for me this set has&nbsp;not a big playability factor, it is standing always in the car line or the parking lot&nbsp;:)</p>

<p><b>Value of the money:</b></p>

<p>As it was a gift from my parents I have no idea of value in the &#39;80s. But today you can get easily very cheap this set from the lot of offers&nbsp;which worth the money you have to pay for it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Most be in the collection of all old LEGOLAND fans and a suggestion for newcomers! :)</p>
