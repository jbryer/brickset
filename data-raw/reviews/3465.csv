"ratz","2005-06-01T07:55:10Z","almost overlooked","Weird: this little tractor, only known as one feature of later and much bigger sets (e.g. in 6541) was once an independent set! How the times have changed, it contains about 20 parts only... usable as freight for trains or boats.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-01-30T17:54:59.013Z","Red Tractor","Minifig scale vehicles besides cars and planes are very cool. This one is a good example of that. The red wheels give this tractor a nicer look and makes this set just plain awesome. 5 out of 5 for a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotowner","2011-03-05T23:11:13.503Z","What did it do?","<p>This tractor was very basic though looked quite good. </p>
<p>It just had no function, no loader like in later sets and you cant tow anything. </p>
<p>It was like a lonely child in my set, only built it when I was really bored and then just sat there with nothing to do.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,1,2

Attractive small red vehicles fit neatly in small hands but when hands grow slightly, such sets&nbsp;may lose appeal.<div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>The black top with blue arms always made a pretty decent minifigure and so warrants an extra point if you like.</li></ul><b>Traction</b></div><div>This farmer obviously needs a small ride around a small farm, so if you own either of these, why not cover them in brown brick 'mud' to get your moneys worth from the small red tractor.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite the lack of action, lifting bucket, towing bar or hook or any kind of useful farm machinery this could likely remain a popular small set in a larger collection. Its not bad but its not that good either, just the average small set thats open to individual taste and sentimental value where appropriate.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Nevertheless these tiny sets are probably quite a busy town once all gathered and when this basic, can be easily scavenged to rebuild so for this reason, small sets could be more attractive for ease of collecting and display...or just hiding in a box.</div><div><br></div><div>Farm was none existent at this time and so this model falls under the 'Maintenance' sub theme.&nbsp;I think I prefer him as a gentleman farmer.&nbsp;To The LEGO Group: please bring back 'Farm' and do it properly!</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5
"Niki124","2021-02-04T20:38:07.407Z","Small set but a lesson in getting your wheels right","<p>This is a small and simple set, aimed at kids out to spend some hard-earned pocket money rather than something to be written about to Santa. It&#39;s easy to underestimate this little set - you might think there&#39;s no need for assembly instructions, a glance at the photograph is all that&#39;s needed to put this together - but I was able to learn a valuable lesson in the use of wheels. This was the first lego set we had with the enlarged tyres, so learning how to build up the undercarriage of the vehicle to balance out the wheels was a welcome one which I was able to reuse.</p>
