<br />
Not much to build - only has about a dozen pieces, and a bit basic compared even to other cars of the same era. No wheel arches, seat or headlight bricks for example. But in its favour, I think it was the cheapest set around at the time so good value for money.</p>

Despite having only a handful of pieces, this set was among my favorites because it was actually MINE:  I bought it myself.  Once I learned how to make the car, I immediately made as many clones as I could with the rest of the pieces in my bedroom.  This set is a simple and economical way to populate the roads of your LEGOLand.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

If I recall correctly there were at least three other designs on the back of the box, which just goes to show how versatile even a 9-piece LEGO car can be.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Niki124","2023-02-19T20:04:03.38Z","Classic little buggy","<p>We weren&#39;t sure what a Beach Buggy was supposed to look like when we acquired this set, but this easy-to-build little car was a fun and inexpensive addition to our collection. As with other sets with few parts, it&#39;s probably not necessary for experienced builders to need to read the instructions to assemble this, a look at the box photograph tells you all you need to know. But at a time when Lego was still quite tentative with its use of colour, the matching car livery and driver&#39;s uniform was a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>
