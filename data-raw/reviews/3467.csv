<p>6610-1 was my very <em>first </em>Lego set in 1982 in the UK. My Uncle had come over from Sri Lanka and stayed with us and as he was preparing to leave bought Lego for his Kids, my Mum got a bit narked he got me nothing at all. So, she <em>made </em>Dad take his Brother back into town and gave some cash for him to buy this set. Basically, Mum got my Uncle to get it for me, she was like that lol...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recall the figures arms and hands even had to be attached back then! My original died very quickly, but I managed to buy it in mint condition out of box WITH the original instructions and tinsy box off ebay for a bargain buy it now price! What I love about it is its simplicity; the halcyon days of the simple, original smiley face on the Lego girl in the set; the fact its Shell Lego as by the 1990's their licence had gone and Octan made its mark-or <em>marque</em>-on Lego Town. I actually think it works perfectly with the much later Shell Shop Lego made many years later (which I also have). In the US Lego had Exxon licenced gas stations and a petrol tanker identical to the Shell ones we had in terms of shape, build and look,&nbsp;but not colours or liveries, Lego missed out by not releasing an Exxon based version, would make a neat custom methinks! </p>

<p>6610-1 will always have a special place in my heart as it was my introduction to the wonder of Lego hence my 5 star ratings on all points! I am biased! </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>The red two-into-one bricks were never very secure, whatever model they were used in. In this set, it was very easy for the upper white part of each petrol pump to fall off - thankfully with the fuel hose in place they couldn&#39;t get too far away.</p>

<p>Stickers - the bane of many Lego fan&#39;s lives - were a big part of this set. Initially I liked how the design reflected the then-new digital readouts, making it feel very modern to me. However any attempt at a rebuild means the beginning of the end for stickers, and more often than not, an unwelcome residue on the bricks.</p>

"sparticusjoe","2017-12-13T19:33:19.723Z","The mother of all sticker over assemblies","<p>I want to love this set, I really do. I have exactly five sets that I&#39;ve unearthed that are from a time before I was born and this is one of them, and I always love seeing old things, and I always love small slice of life Town sets, so it seems like a natural fit for me. Unfortunately this set isn&#39;t much of a set. It&#39;s an attractive little display piece for a larger town, but as an actual <em>set</em>, it&#39;s pretty lacking, mostly because over half the pieces in its extremely limited piece count are covered by four massive stickers and thus can never be used again for anything, ever.</p>

<p><strong>The Set: </strong>For what it is, it looks good. It&#39;s a small pair of gas pumps and an attendant, with Shell branding on them. The pumps are sort of out of scale for modern cars and older nineties cars, but I&#39;ll let it slide because this came first so technically that makes the 90&#39;s sets out of scale to this. It actually looks exactly like an old-timey gas pump, the type that don&#39;t really exist too much anymore, having been replaced with all-digital displays at least in my extremely remote neck of the woods. My copy of the set still has the stickers (amazingly, for something this old and that was undoubtedly bought at a thrift store or flea market) and the stickers honestly do look attractive on it. It&#39;s not the contents of the stickers that bother me, it&#39;s that they&#39;re here at all.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Both sides of the tops of the gas pumps have large stickers on them. Those stickers go from the bottom 2x3 plate, to the middle 1x2 brick and 1x1 90 degree angle hole bricks that I&#39;m sure have a more appropriate name if you&#39;re more knowledgeable about Lego than myself, and are even on the top 2x3 plate. This is to say that A), the stickers cover three whole layers of bricks, and B) because the stickers extend to the plates, they&#39;re effectively making it so that if you want to re-use, take apart, MOC, or in any way alter the design of the top two gas pumps, you&#39;ll have to break an extremely rare, old, and valuable sticker pair. You can&#39;t even go halfway and remove it from one side only, because the upper plates are still covered by the stickers. The whole 2x3 assembly is nothing but sticker and thus will be stuck as they are forever unless you want to ruin an extremely old and rare Lego set with stickers you probably will never find again.</p>

<p>Considering that this is seriously half the building experience of this tiny set, I&#39;m going to rate it very low in this category. I actually like how the top pump part is mounted to the bottom of it, with a pair of 1x2 to 1x1 tile bricks making it so that the pumps are centered. That&#39;s actually a really good technique for making a realistic looking, not too big and not too small gas pump of your own design. Unfortunately the stickers just ruin it because you can never, ever rebuild it.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Lots of good parts. Again, rating this lower because despite the 29 pieces ten of them are covered by stickers forever and four of them are a minifigure, but what&#39;s there is good. The hose pieces hold up great, look the part, and are still in good shape after over 35 years of existence. The minifig torso looks amazing and is printed wit the shell logo. The minifigure&#39;s hair is pretty cool considering they don&#39;t make anything even remotely like it anymore, and the pair of printed 1x2 bricks with the shell logo on them are really cool as well.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>As stated in many reviews before, I&#39;m a crabby old man that doesn&#39;t really play with toys anymore. However, I do like to display them and the displayability is superb for this set. It fits in great with other Shell-branded sets you may have laying around or other non-shell branded stuff for some real-world authenticity. It looks attractive and if you put it next to similarly old models that are to scale with it it&#39;s a great scene-maker.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>No clue what this was bought for when my parents got it for me, as I would have been maybe six years old and it was undoubtedly long discontinued and bought secondhand. These days though it can be fairly expensive, with bricklink selling it from four to a hundred and fifty four dollars. It isn&#39;t worth that much, honestly. There are better examples of this sort of thing for less money out there that you can actually rebuild into other things. For some reason this set basically has to be imported so I&#39;d mostly just recommend it to people who are buying other sets that want an impulse buy thing to add to their cart. Don&#39;t go out of your way to get this one.</p>
