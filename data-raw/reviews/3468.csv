Was perfect because the white helmet, the walkie talkie, give this guy the perfect look for a chief fireman. Due to the good size of the station I could park the car outside and with an emergency the fire squad was complete.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"tinbrick","2012-06-17T02:00:07.24Z","Good things come in small packages","I remember getting this set for the first time in the three-pack which included the tow-truck and doctor's car. The fact it is small, easy to build, lacking in any bells and whistles and pretty much a set picked up as a last minute gift meant I ended up with lots of these little fellas. Yes, as mentioned a previous review, any fire chief turning up to an incident in a go kart would be a laughing stock. And yes, in an actual fire emergency the vehicle is next to useless (you can't even rescue a cat stuck up a tree). But it was always fun to play with and sums up the innocence of Lego when you're a kid before Lego video games and Star Wars kits that are going for $1000 online! I still remember how to make the cart off by heart more than 28 years later and this alone would always endear the set to me. 5 out of 5.<br>",TRUE,5,2,4,5,5
"Niki124","2023-02-19T20:29:56.483Z","Fun and striking little vehicle","<p>This looks like a simple little car to build but the layers involved to ensure the sirens are incorporated means there&#39;s more to it than first meets the eye. It also means there&#39;s enough pieces to get a bit creative with one&#39;s own designs. This was the first set we owned which incorporated the one-piece moulded chair, which quickly became a favourite piece. At the time, the minifigure stood out from other firefighters thanks to the white helmet, which designated the character as the Fire Chief, but this was undermined somewhat when later sets gave all firefighters white helmets instead of the conventional black.&nbsp;</p>
