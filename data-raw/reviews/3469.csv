"bmwlego","2007-10-22T13:51:32.937Z","Small and Unrealistic, Non-Detailed Set","I have owned this set for 20 years and am glad to still have it but boy is it lacking in details/realism. The set does include a firefighter mini figure but not much else. You get what you pay for with this set. As the other reviewer for this set stated, it is missing a fire extinguisher. It is also missing doors for the jeep and most other details for the jeep like a windshield, top half of the frame, etc. The grill piece and fire emblem tile are great but more is needed to increase the rating for this set in my mind.

"T79","2015-11-20T13:18:29.407Z","Even memories can't save this one...","<p>Every time (or almost every time) I visited my grandmother she had some tiny lego set to give, one day this included this&nbsp;fire car&nbsp;which still brings happy memories. But happy memories don&#39;t necessarily make a good set, as we&#39;ll see here.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Both are long gone, I used online instructions to build this again although it&#39;s easy enough to figure out without them. A standard small folding sheet on the usual blue-to-green background, seven steps and you&#39;re done. There are the obligatory alternative models but given the abundance of basic plates&nbsp;in this very small set&nbsp;there&#39;s nothing spectacular there.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As said before, mostly basic plates: four-fifths of the car is a plate. The few parts of note are a printed 2 x 2 tile with fire logo (which on its own merits an extra point here) and a printed 1 x 2 brick with grille, although the trans-clear 1 x 1 plates have for a long time been unique in our collection for some reason. Even now they are still less prevalent than the other colours we have of this part, the fact that they were quite easily lost may not be of help there.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For a long time this minifigure constituted our&nbsp;entire fire department all on his own, until he finally was joined by his brethren of #6611 Fire Chief&#39;s Car and #6643 Fire Truck (yes, we&nbsp;received #6611 only after we got #6612, must have been a hand-me-down). It&#39;s a great minifigure in his simplicity, the fact that they remained basically the same over a decade means it was quite easy to get a large, uniform fire crew. Too bad he does not have a fire extinguisher, nor does #6611 but at least that fireman can call for backup with his radio while&nbsp;our chief here can only warn bystanders to stay out of the way.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Even for such a small set&nbsp;the build is&nbsp;rather weak, if the car looked a bit better it might not have mattered so much but it&#39;s just an open assembly of plates with the fireman on top&nbsp;- rather than inside -&nbsp;of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The lack of a fire extinguisher severely hampers playability here,he is a captain so in a way it is right to give him something else but without any other firefighters around there&#39;s not much he can do.&nbsp;In fact, the same criticism can be applied to #6611 which at least had a quirky look going for it. This car here is rather more boring, needless to say once we got #6643 both of&nbsp;these small&nbsp;vehicles were never built again but at least the firemen were still useful.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t bother searching for this one, if you need a&nbsp;car for a fire chief from the eighties get #6643 instead. Even though that set is&nbsp;bigger and more expensive it is more than worth the difference. Otherwise just get the fireman and maybe the printed pieces and you have everything of interest in this set.</p>
