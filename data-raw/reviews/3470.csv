It was a suitable pocket money sized box with plenty of excitement in the form of some new bricks for the Town subtheme. Your people need to call all those services emergency and maintenance crews but in olden day Lego Town, few houses come with a 'telephone'. Did everyone use yellow bricks as money and gold?&nbsp;<div>""Can anyone spare a flat, smooth one stud yellow brick? I need to call the Fire Brigade as my house is on fire!""</div><div>Well at least they are in walking distance...</div><div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Blue striped tank top, trousers and cap, smiling as they all used to.</li></ul></div><div><b>Hanging On The Telephone</b></div><div>Our public telephone booth is bright yellow and first of all, a look at the person using it.&nbsp;The blue stripey 1980s Town tank top is a fetching piece though became a bit boring if you got more than one of a single colour. The blue cap is a good hat and the blue trousers create a hilariously colour coordinated character that only a MF would feel comfortable as without blushing. The black bike is a personal favourite for bike colours, of which there were not many.</div><div><br></div><div>The booth has an excellent slanting smooth chamfered style top roof brick to shed err Lego rain and is easily enough completed with a straight forward but satisfying build. The black telephone is an excellent brick and is centrally placed with the one studded (2 stud long) offset. It has a keypad print and is quite durable and hard wearing surprisingly. Its likeable how the receiver is a 'cheat of placing a smooth two long smooth black piece centrally on to one stud atop of the phone.</div><div><br></div><div>The bench to the side is nicely solid but has the age old classic problem of no two MFs ever being able to sit together across just four studs, of course needing five for the arms to meet in between, the chunky rascals. No doubt this is a practical joke on the part of the designer to cause Laurel and Hardy style fights between MFs when they both try and sit down at the same time.</div><div><br></div><div>The phone is sadly easily removed and so provides extra 'comedy' in the shape of phone theft and retrieval. Funny - if you're the thief, but not if your their sibling.</div><div><br></div><div>The red base raises this model off the pavement and brightens up a road or street plate, giving it some busy-busy. A very nice small build indeed with lovely parts and a warmly remembered collectible set for the Town era, such additions making it differ to City with extra points for charm.</div></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,2

"sparticusjoe","2017-11-30T17:12:03.277Z","When you have two design flaws and two elements, this is what you get.","<p>I really, really want to like this set. This is the type of set I normally adore: small, slice of life things that can fill blank space in your city. With minimal adjustment this is an excellent set. However, I do try to grade sets as they&#39;re supposed to be put together as I reckon that&#39;s what 95 percent of people that get them will see when they get them. This set, as the instructions tell you to put together, is not very well made at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mostly going to be whining about a whopping two design flaws this set has. I know that doesn&#39;t sound like many, and it&#39;s not. In a set with, say, thirty elements to it, two design flaws is nothing. In a set with two elements to it, and a design flaw in both of them, that&#39;s quite a lot. Do note, both are easily fixed and if you do fix them this set is a lot better. However, as the set was sold and has the instructions telling you to construct it, they&#39;re there and present and annoying.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate this set at all, I really like the concept and wish Lego would re-release (and update the design of!) this set, I&#39;d be the first in line to get it. However, with such a small set the flaws with it are really apparent.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>To give it credit, it sure looks good. It was obviously designed more with appearance in mind than functionality. The phone booth looks like a phone booth, the bench looks like a bench, and the bike obviously looks like a bike. I actually think the phone booth design is really clever and would love to have seen more of this in other sets. When I was growing up phone booths were still around, just starting to be on the way out. Kids nowadays probably wouldn&#39;t know what the things are anymore looking at them if they were included in modern sets. So it goes.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>This is the set&#39;s problem. Two flaws with it: The phone booth *really* doesn&#39;t stand upright all that well (particularly given the set&#39;s advanced age and studs&#39; tendency to loosen up over nearly 30 years), and the bench is not designed with the dimensions of a minifigure in mind.</p>

<p>Minifigures are four studs wide because of their arms taking up an extra stud on each side of them. The bench is... four studs wide. In other words, you can&#39;t actually have two figures sitting on the bench next to each other without taking their arms off. It&#39;s a two seater bench that seats one. You can seperate the two seats easily enough and fix the problem, of course, but then you run into another problem: These benches really don&#39;t stand upright all that well. It&#39;s two 2x2 inverted slope bricks with a chair on top of them. That&#39;s it. No re-enforcement whatsoever, both are freestanding so both get front heavy and are quite flimsy. Part of this is just age; sets do that as they get old, which is why re-enforcement is so important. Adding a 2x2 yellow plate under the chairs makes them a bit sturdier. Seperating the bricks and adding a 2x6 yellow plate makes the bench able to seat two and look even more like a bench. Sad thing is that when you&#39;re doing that it&#39;s not really the original set at all and you&#39;re MOC-ing it so I&#39;m not going to rate it higher just because the problems are easily fixed, it&#39;s just weird that they&#39;re there at all.</p>

<p>The phone booth fares a bit better but is really front heavy. It&#39;s attached to the base plate (not baseplate, though that would have been nice, just the plate that&#39;s being used as a base) by one 2x1 brick and that&#39;s it, but the thing is quite wide and front heavy and again, older Lego bricks plus 31 years equals it&#39;s not as sturdy as it could be. Swap o ut the inverted slope and the 2x1 brick with a pair of yellow 2x2 bricks, the kind every Lego enthusiast on earth has a million of laying around, and you&#39;ve fixed it and have an excellent phone booth model. Again, sadly, that&#39;s not what the model is like stock so it&#39;s not as good as it could have been stock. Having 2x3 worth of bricks balancing on 2x1 worth of bricks on the back of it isn&#39;t a very sturdy design.</p>

<p>&quot;Who cares how sturdy it is, sparticusjoe? It&#39;s an impulse buy set that&#39;s been out of print for longer than you&#39;ve been alive!&quot; I hear you say.</p>

<p>I mean yeah, you&#39;re right, it just bugs me when things aren&#39;t sturdy, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s probably nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Great parts here at least. Well, two of them, three if you count the minifigure, but out of 24 parts total that&#39;s a good amount. The 2x1 telephone slope brick is hard to find, the minifigure&#39;s that awesome smiley old timey type, and a black (!) bicycle included makes it worth getting for those alone. And it&#39;s always neat for a 90&#39;s kid like myself to see what Lego looked like in the primordial ooze era before I was born, so just seeing how different the older pieces look is cool.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Sadly not very high. Again, re-enforce it, fix the design problems, and it&#39;s fantastic, but stock standard it isn&#39;t great... You can&#39;t have two minifigures sitting on the two minifigure bench. Fix it and it&#39;s great.</p>

<p>The displayability is very high, however, if you just want an attractive aside for your town. Great space filler, and looks good supplanted onto a street corner somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Depends on how much you&#39;re paying. This set is older than me, and probably older than 99 percent of Lego&#39;s demographic, but if you find it at a flea market (as I did) absolutely pick it up. It gets a bit on the pricey side on Bricklink and like most cool old sets is mostly just available in the Netherlands (must be something in the water over there that convinced them to hoard old vintage Lego sets when the rest of us did not...) and with that comes importation fees, high shipping, and the customs monster eating your Lego sets alive because they may be a threat to national security.</p>

<p>If you can find it for cheap, pick it up, and buy some yellow bricks and plates to fix the dang thing while you&#39;re at it. I don&#39;t really recommend it on its own, but fixing it is easy enough.</p>
