Its fairly simple but has loads of really neat touches such as the sliding doors that open up to reveal the equipment. It may be a spaceport fire engine but uts more than capable at tackling any fires in legotown.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-06-16T00:07:25.043Z","The Perfect War Vehicle DUH I MEAN Rescue Vehicle yeah that's what I said not the other thing","What we have here is a nice, well-equipped and nicely-armed city vehicle. A great vehicle for those imaginary city building fires that need to be put out. First, the minifig is pretty cool. He comes with visor snorkel with matching fire helmet. The back of the snorkel has a small slot for the oxygen tank the figure wears in the back. It also has this nice hazmat suit design.

The vehicle comes equipped with a hammer, axe, a fire extinguisher (the tap on a cylinder peg), and a ""crankable"" thread hose. Unique features include the flip-top roof on the driver's seat and weapons compartment on the side. And a REVOLVING fire hose on top of the rescue van for those...hard-to-reach places.

No flaws I can think of here. Colors are nice. And even with LEGO's improvents in vehicle designs as of late, this one stands the test of time. So if you find a good deal for it on ebay, snag it while it's available. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"piratetown","2010-11-23T07:47:44.06Z","Engine for any occasion","A nice engine similar to the one contained in the 5571 fire station. Cool fire suit, oxygen tank and mask as other sets of this era. Other equipment is a hammer, an axe, two extinguishers and water cannon. Attractive lighting set up and colour scheme makes it useful even without&nbsp; having any of the launch sets. <br>A quality small set all in all, and very modifiable.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5

Works very well within the town/launch command series but also does wonders on any airport/field. Very nice minifig, hose, water-gun and some tools. Not that many cons besides the water-gun that keeps on falling of. Must have for all fire truck fans!<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-13T12:57:23.777Z","Save the Shuttle with Launch Evac 1","<p>Set #6614 Launch Evac 1: Returning to Classic Town LEGO sets, I have fingered the final three sets I once owned while growing up. And I finally figured out where my Fire Fighter with the black hat and gray torso originated from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launch Evac 1 is part of the Launch Command Sub-Theme, shuttle launches from LEGO Town Space Centre. This vehicle is used to protect and deal with shuttle crashes, helping to evacuate the crew and put a stop to any fires in the event of catastrophic system failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is compact, simple and easy to build and features stickers for details. The vehicle stands out among others when put next to (for example) the new Sports Car or the classic Fire Engines. A relatively cheap set with a lot of white pieces, accessories are also included, aside from the standard fire axe and hammer tools there is also some buildable fire extinguishers, an oxygen tank in yellow, the face shield used by the fire fighter and a hose with rope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really had a grand old time building this set and racing through the Victory Lap Raceway (or what was left of it.) to put out fires. It's a great little set and a great addition to anyone's Town display. The Mini-Figure is also a great addition to LEGO Town/City, since this style of Firefighter is rarer than the common Firefighters in black. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-13T18:28:45.93Z","Launch Pad Response","<p>It is 1995 and Launch Command got this&nbsp;essential truck as safety back up for the launch pad. Its released the same year but some of these sets carry the&nbsp;older badge used previously on&nbsp;just one set from 1992.&nbsp;The two sets in 1992 were not an official subtheme and the original shuttle and launch pad <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1682-1/Space-Shuttle-Launch"">https://brickset.com/sets/1682-1/Space-Shuttle-Launch</a>&nbsp;was badged as &#39;USA&#39; and &#39;NASA&#39; with a US flag which looked great. If you want uniformed launch pads then this truck goes fine with the 1992 sets, not all 1995 sets share the old badge though.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>A bit of facial hair is used this time for variety, a moustached head that always reminds me of&nbsp;the French waiter from the classic &#39;ristorante&#39;. The heavy duty fire outfit is pretty excellent with its print, enclosed helmet&nbsp;some new parts for the year I believe.</p>

<p><strong>Extinguished</strong><br />
I really liked the&nbsp;development of vehicles around this time as axles got &#39;locked in&#39; by plates for rigidity. This made the vehicles lower sometimes. Wheel arches got built more often with upward slants as used here. There are nice gear areas and compartment&nbsp;areas to house them while the hose line is finally placed properly - sideways. The helmet is stashed as yet more gear is added within the cupboards and shut in with a steel roller looking&nbsp;shutter (that lifts), rather professional looking. The water cannon is fine and the lights too though i would not have put blue on airport or launch pad emergency vehicles. I think blue distinguishes security better. The front is reasonable but had bricks to set it up for all manner of designs and so is functional. As a release this would have been nice to have back in 1992.</p>

<p><strong>Abort Launch</strong><br />
I really enjoyed this vehicle&nbsp;build if not the model very much. It is good just not that stand out for me but there is no reason why it should not suit many a collection, there are not many launch pad fire engines after all. The gear and internal structure are the strong point and while not universally attractive it is definitely different with a very decent minifigure.</p>
