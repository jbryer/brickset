The guy is the dark glasses dude with a black helmet and the best world war 2 bomber jacket. The plane itself is alittle small and the glass is just blocky. It has a pretty good landing carriage but from the side it just looks like the pilot is driving a toddlers plane. It is a divine set that is worth getting if you like legoplanes or if you want to soup up a big bi-plane war! Chow fa' Now!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Yob","2009-07-26T21:30:10.123Z","Perfect Lego stunt plane","Finally arrived in the post after getting it off ebay.  Mine came with box and instructions and the set is in perfect condition.

Everything about this set is just perfect.  The scale is just right and the detail level is exceptional.  With only 3 stickers on 2 parts (1 on the main engine and 1 on either side of the tail piece) it makes up all the other details with good use of simple bricks.  Of note is the landing gear, which has dual shocks on either wheel and the inventive make up of the radial engine.  The mini fig is also cool, with printed raybans on his head and a cool bomber jacket design on his torso.  Colour scheme is excelent as well, with it looking like a red pitts special aerobatic aircraft.  Possibly the only thing that could have made this set better would have been the inclusion of a groundstaff mechanic and maybe some tools, but it doesnt detract from the set at all.

For any aircraft enthusist, this set is great and will be taking pride of place in my towns airport.  Im guessing as for problems with finding them second hand, you could have problems with the chrome exhaust pipes if they have had some wear and the chrome has rubbed off, other than that it would just be the conditions of the stickers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nesquik","2013-03-18T08:40:29.1Z","Eagle Stunt Flyer","The trend for small aeroplanes (of sorts) has become almost unfashionable in the Lego City, for reasons best known to the company themselves. Whereas the Lego System always has loose divisions in its town range, the introduction of <i>City </i>has created a much stricter set of sub-themes that designs must abide by, and in the process, hints of repetition have occurred.<div><br></div><div>This years 60019 'Stunt Plane' signals at least a temporary alternative to passenger aircrafts, and has attempted to capture some of the playability that is, decidedly, what <i>City </i>caters for. But I do at least they are more regularly released in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>6615 'Eagle Stunt Flyer', meanwhile, sets the groundwork for small Lego aircraft. It is by no means perfect from a design perspective, and in retrospect, was more relevant during its original release than today. This doesn't make it a bad product; far from it even.</div><div><br></div><div>The Eagle is just a lovely toy, plain and simple. Small attention to detail is paid to the landing gears, engine and exhausts, but the product really shines in its 'swooshability'. It is perfectly scaled for a child's hand, and more over, is a nice size to keep in a Lego collection. The plane is fun without ever being constricted to a tight narrative, and that is the key element of play that TLG have obviously remembered - it <i>is </i>possible to spark the imagination without a linear story. The product simply includes a plane and a pilot.</div><div><br></div><div>I had my Eagle on display for years and it looked fantastic, though it was just as fun to play with. The nostalgia in me loves it more as a part of my childhood, but without that bias, it still stands out as one of the few well designed aircraft in Legoland.</div><div><br><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
"clundsberg","2011-05-06T01:03:57.993Z","I looove me some airplanes :)","<p>This set gets a gool ol 5/5 just like the Baron's Bi-Plane.&nbsp; Here's why in a nutshell:</p>
<p>-High detail: from the radial engine to the shocks behind the wheels - this is a very well thought-out model. (only clear-based tail stickers too)</p>
<p>-2 words: Chromed Pieces (Why didn't they do this with the new Lego Semi's smoke stacks?)</p>
<p>-Tail Wheel - a very nice touch</p>
<p>-Blue windshield is nice as most of my pieces like this are simply clear.&nbsp; Likewise, the visor on the figure matches with th esame clear blue.</p>
<p>-Very cool fig...no really, he's cool. He has shades on and a leather jacket.&nbsp; This is the Fonzie of Lego figures, people.</p>
<p>-Price.&nbsp; 9 bucks for all this? are you kidding me *swipe*</p>
<p>This plane holds up well to the more modern planes and even the adventure series bi-planes I have.&nbsp; It's a good scale. This too would be listed under my never dismantled Lego sets...well except my son forced it to be when he was younger.</p>
<p>A fun rebuild but very, very red. (which is great if you lack red Legos) and a nice plane to add to your airport.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
