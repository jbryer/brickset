The dragster has a pullback motor and it comes with a man and a helmet. this dragster is very good for 6-8 year olds and could make a great addition your collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-17T09:09:12.557Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Rocket Dragster Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of yellow, black and white pieces. All of them are always great to have for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figure looks really cool. I like the printed tiger on the torso and the design of the face. The helmet looks very nice as well.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6616-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a lot of stuff in it: We get a gate, a dragster and a lever which you can use to hold the dragster after you've pulled the motor back. The engines of this vehicle and the rear wing can be adjusted as well. The gate we get is also able to move the flags up if you push the LEGO Technic pieces with the flames on it. I really can't complain about this set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
