"Blade","2007-09-04T12:31:20.833Z","Speed Shark","I am sure I got this set as a part of a group with models 6707 and 6619. May have come as a promotional thing with something I really wish I could remember. These were the early Racers as such without the pull back motors. 

The model is based around the colour blue with a touch of white and grey. A whole ten pieces plus wheels and fig so 23 all up can't really say much. It has a sloped front and skinny twin exhausts. Wheels appear slightly too small.

The mini-fig is blue with a shark on his race jacket. His helmet isn't the traditional one either with goggles instead of a visor.

Overall its nothing spectacular but as a team the three look good so this one scraps a 5/10 just for its playability. Ok if u like racers but look good if you are a collector  looking for something different as these there are... different.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-19T10:24:01.983Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Blue Racer Review","This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well. This set may doesn't have any play features but this is still fun to maneuver it. I also like the design for this little set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-26T23:35:49.637Z","A simple impulse purchase, with little to recommend it","<p>In contrast to my longer reviews, I don&#39;t have too much to say on this set, Blue Racer.&nbsp; I picked it up as part of a bulk auction on eBay where it was included with about seven other sets for free.&nbsp; I never had too much contact with the Race sub-theme&nbsp;past 2000, and this was a set I never saw, let alone owned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blue Racer seems to me to be one of those &quot;cheap buy&quot; sets, maybe a stocking stuffer or an impulse purchase for a kid.&nbsp; You might see it in a petrol station or an end aisle display, it&#39;s the kind of thing you as a kid got from an aunt or uncle or distant family member.&nbsp;It&#39;s a quick, easy build that can help fill out a Lego collection, and doesn&#39;t need a lot of thought put into the purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Not much to say on this front - it&#39;s 23 pieces all up, basically a polybag.&nbsp; Bottom to top building, brisk, comes together fast.&nbsp; No stickers or stamps, just brick building.&nbsp; Once it&#39;s all done, you have a little racecar, though I should say this looks more like a Go-Kart to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Not too many of them on offer here - again, 23 pieces but you get four tyres, some axles, slopes.&nbsp; You get a steering&nbsp;wheels and those are always good to have for your own cars or space ships.&nbsp; The blue racer, with his shark shirt, could be an incentive&nbsp;for this set, especially since you could reuse the torso in your own adventures. I personally think the tyres should have been a bit bigger, but the smooth go-kart tyres are always nice to have.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Toys of cars, whether Lego or diecast, have an innate sense of movement as cars are meant to move.&nbsp; And cars are a great toy for kids because kids know what cars are from a young age, so there&#39;s no need to explain how it all works.&nbsp; So a little race car model with a person opens up immediate story possibilities - races along the couch and floor, a chase scene, an action film car battle, or maybe it&#39;s just a regular car?&nbsp; The car moves well, you&#39;ve got decent clearance and it stays together well for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will say, it&#39;s a bit hard to rank playability&nbsp;because this set was clearly meant to just be a car and a person, with little else here for a kid&nbsp;so for me to start asking for things like tools, storage or terrain sort of defeats the purpose of a tiny impulse purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>Hmmm, hard to say on this one as I got it as part of a bulk lot.&nbsp; The current value according to Brickset is used $3 Australian dollars, and that&#39;s not a bad price for a minifig and all the pieces, $10 Australian for new in box.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t believe they sold this in a box, I thought this would have been a polybag for sure.</p>

<p>All that&nbsp;being said, I&#39;m not sure why you would want to pick up this set - it was clearly an impulse purchase/stocking stuffer set from the year 2000, with not a huge amount of thought or care really put into it.&nbsp; You could easily build a car like this from spare parts or on Bricklink for less than a dollar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts.</strong></p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s&nbsp;much reason to be picking this set up in the year 2020.&nbsp; It&#39;s small, overly simple and doesn&#39;t have any special pieces to add to a parts collection.&nbsp; The minifigure is cool, but doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have much to him outside a blue shark torso and blue helmet.&nbsp; If it&#39;s part of a bulk lot, obviously don&#39;t turn it down but I wouldn&#39;t be really scouring the web for this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
