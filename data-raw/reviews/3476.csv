The model is based around the colour red. A whole seven pieces plus wheels and fig so 20 all up can't really say much. Has the steering wheel right at the front and a sloped piece at the back. Tires are a good size as well.

The mini-fig is red with a scorpion on his race jacket. His helmet is is also red with a solid black visor which is really nice.

Overall its nothing spectacular but as a team the three look good so this one scraps a 5/10 just for its playability. Ok if u like racers but look good if you are a collector looking for something different as these there are... different.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-20T09:19:16.363Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Red Four Wheel Driver Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers in this set. This set may doesn't have any play features but it's still very easy to maneuver it. I like the design for this small model and I also like the design of the minifig we get in this set.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
