"redbeardlegoman","2017-04-09T06:00:12.89Z","20 Pieces That Taught Me Geography and History","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>A cute vintage set that taught me a few things I never knew.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>I bought this set approximately 30 years after it was released (I guess I really had to think about this one). &nbsp;One of the delights of buying older sets is seeing how the instructions have changed. &nbsp;Simple white background. &nbsp;Easy to follow. &nbsp;A few alternate build photos. &nbsp;Ah, memories.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are some who can probably remember, or have researched, when certain new parts came out, or whether any are exclusive to this set. &nbsp;I&#39;m not one of those people (and bless their hearts). &nbsp;But there are a few pieces in this that I love.<br />
<br />
The yellow old-school motorcycle. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t love it, you are incapable of love.<br />
<br />
The envelopes. &nbsp;The print is a great piece of minimalist design. &nbsp;It&#39;s totally tight.<br />
<br />
The Danish Post horn on the torso and the post box - and for a wonderful reason. &nbsp;Seeing them got me curious. &nbsp;Why was there a &quot;tuba&quot; (as 7 year old me thought when I saw it the first time) on the mailbox? &nbsp;It made me learn about the post horn, which I had never seen in Canada. &nbsp;It was one of my early understandings of symbolism, deeper levels of meaning, a broader world... not bad for two pieces of plastic children&#39;s toy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In 2017, these are pretty simple minifigures, even if they exclusive to this set (which is somewhat amazing, considering the &quot;customer&quot; minifigure is unremarkable at a glance).</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Even for 1984 this isn&#39;t a remarkable build. &nbsp;It fits in well with other sets from roughly the same time period.<br />
<br />
However, 33 years later, it takes on a kind of retrospect awesomeness. &nbsp;There weren&#39;t anywhere near as many parts available then as there are now. &nbsp;The palate was limited, both in colour and components. &nbsp;But, with such simple parts, a convincing motorcycle with side car and mailbox are built. &nbsp;Today, it would be a polybag, at best. &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t fathom it being released for more than $4-5 CAD now. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Future and aspiring MOCers&nbsp;take note. &nbsp;This is your history text book. &nbsp;These sets are your school. &nbsp;Learn from these, and hone your skills and vision.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Completed Model</strong><br />
<br />
This happy little yellow delivery bike is charmingly vintage, instead of looking dated or old-fashioned simplistic. &nbsp;I adore this set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall Opinion</strong><br />
<br />
You aren&#39;t likely to find this in great condition for a good price. &nbsp;But, if you do, you owe it to yourself to pick it up. &nbsp;Don&#39;t dither. &nbsp;Buy it. &nbsp;Put it under glass, and set in a great space for display.</p>
