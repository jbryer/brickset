"lamax6","2006-06-21T01:17:10Z","Pull Over!!","Great little set.  All three of mine do a great job patrolling the town and the airport on the outskirts of town.  I got rid of the white lightbar, and instead placed a 1x2 black plate on the roof to separate the lights.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"folkform","2006-07-16T22:38:52Z","Classic goodness","This was my first ever lego set, so I feel like I should give it a perfect score.  It is well constructed and is great to play with.  However, it is a bit too plain, even for 1984 standards--the front needs something more than just the headlights to designate from the back.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I really like the detail put into this set and yet it is still fun to play with. The double sirens are very cool and gives it a nice touch. This set is really good and must be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2007-10-04T07:24:31.45Z","A town classic","<p>This set uses the best ever car design from Lego - appearing in a number of sets - and puts it in a Police car format. While there may have been some quicker looking cars over the years, there has never been a better cruiser for your officers to patrol your town! Also blends very nicely with the &quot;classic&quot; Police stations released through the 80s.</p>

"legotowner","2011-03-05T22:54:43.993Z","Legotown Patrol Car - did the job well","<p>This was one of my first sets, not sure what was my first I cant remember, but this was probably my early favourite when I started buliding and playing aged 3 or 4.</p>
<p>The car was simple, looked like a police car with a good looking policeman and had speed. The base of the car could be used to make other cars but the police setup was good enough and replaced the jeep from&nbsp;6386 garage when it was built.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the car was taken to the wreckers when the base plate split in two, it could still be built but the structural integrity had been comprimised for high speed chases.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

Not different for Lego. This set could be way more interesting, regardless of it being released in a time when Lego vehicles were more intended to be playable with than to look real (no problem with that, either). I won't recall the sets numbers, but you can look them up as an example that good cars COULD be done at the time this patrol car first went to store:

Highway maintenance truck
Postal truck
Octan tanker
etc. etc...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You could place preference with similar cars in larger sets- the one with the same era Police Station has more black and obviously comes with a large building, vehicles and staff.
