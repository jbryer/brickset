"jimcha","2005-12-15T10:48:21Z","lego delivery","This is a pretty simple set but I love it!  A rather simple design, it has a nice front grille piece as well as the two panels with cargo stickers.  Unfortunately no cargo is included and the minifig is rather generic, but these things are quite easy to fix.  Goes great with the cargo center (6391).  I want more!!!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"folkform","2006-07-16T22:41:42Z","My favorite!","Classic of the classics! The design is very simple, but has so much playability because of the back hatch and storage space.  Easily the best small set that I have ever played with. The small highlights, like the front grill block and the stickers break up the red just enough to prevent it from becoming monotonous.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Either way this small red van is signed to display the business involved, a universal symbol always better than words in Lego Town.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路][</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><div>The black cap makes a decent man at work type.</div><div><br><div><b>Delivery Drop Driver</b></div></div><div>The van is a well repeated short chassis and plate based vehicle that has a printed grill and the standard headlights doors and steering wheel arrangement. Its pretty good that the back gets a hinged plate for a proper back door as does of course the roof except its not the usual hinged cab rear window and plate, as is often used on vans. Rear lights sometimes are badly placed or hung, I find so it was also good that they were flat on the rear door. The red panels are like all four stud panels of this sort, great for space making and get the stickers of a 'box in to van' or 'rapid delivery' symbol in yellow. A good symbol and I might be used in other sets if I'm not mistaken so potentially this is part of a fleet if a collector so wished.</div><div><br></div><div>Incidentally if you wanted to build a courier or cargo fleet, the box van fits very well with this set:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6391-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6391-1</a></div><div><br></div><div>The alternative builds that come with this were as usual not that good and or amusing. Only fair I should go and try to do better for making such a remark really. Its a great little vehicle of standard 1980's design and very likeable with just one small flaw. They didn't include a box! No matter, everyone has something to put in the back for delivery. A simple but fun build to learn basic Town vehicles by and another childhood favourite for some.</div>",TRUE,3,2,3,4,2
"sf1378","2011-09-27T20:10:46.99Z","SMALL AND NICE. ","I like this set. Its a classic-of a bygone era sadly missed in Lego these days. Lego really <i>needs </i>to get back to basics and reintroduce a comprehensive Town line with small sets like these once more that are varied, playable and easy to buy for a small child with pocket money, or a parent, or an AFOL. Lego's very expensive these days and the classic Town range afforded sets that enabled any person to buy a set-on impulse or not. Their simplistic yet well-thought out design aesthetics like in this one added to the purchase factor-as well as the really nice photography on the boxes.<div><br></div><div>This small Delivery Van's had enough reviews as to <i>why </i>its so loveable, but theres one other thing to add-it has a very European feel to it. It reminds me of those small French box vans of the 1970s/80s. I think if I had one idea on improving it Lego could have added the 'French Windows' style doors seen on the slightly larger Postal Van of the same era or the Ambulance that came out at around that same period or a year before. However, this would enlarge the vehicle ever-so-slightly and it is its <i>boxiness</i>&nbsp;that makes this toy so special. I also agree that a small item of 'cargo' would have been good-perhaps a tiled Letter plate atop a 1x2 white brick or a cube brick in yellow with a flat plate to match?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If this set had been redesigned and reintroduced in later Town series, such as the Dumper Truck was, I'm sure the small trolley palette would have been an added bonus as well as a small parcel made of a yellow cube brick....</div><div><br></div><div>Other than that, <i>why </i>improve on such a classic design? I may make a custom someday.</div>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"T79","2014-07-04T13:06:08.77Z","One of the first sets I remember having","<p>Also one of the first sets I rebuilt for my children after getting all of my old lego from the attic, and it felt as good as when I was a child.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Actually, I lied in that first part: it felt better than when I was a child as the instructions were long lost before I really started with lego. I must have been about three years old when I got this -&nbsp;too young to build it myself (but not to play with it) - and when I <em>would</em> have been able to I no longer could find the instructions so this was the first time in ~30 years I have it built before me... thank you Peeron!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A red brick with a black printed grill and 2 red panels with&nbsp;a nice &#39;delivery service&#39; icon on a sticker. Strangely, the print on the brick has faded while the stickers are still in very good condition! And of course everything to make a small van: wheels, doors, hinges, windscreen... wait, no parcel?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One classic, plain minifig. Most of the minifigs I had back then were like this: plain colour shirt and trousers and a&nbsp;matching hat (hair being comparatively rare). The minifigs I had from #6302 were really the exception for me, still there was no need for anything more intricate as this&nbsp;particular minifigure&nbsp;has been used as delivery man, sailor, repairman or a myriad of other roles I saw fit.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Due to this being just a very small van there&#39;s nothing really worth mentioning, but after all these years it was still satisfying to build this and see it completed, for the full minute or so it lasts anyway.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Four-stud-wide&nbsp;perfection! It&#39;s a very cute little van in a nice colour scheme and (for its size) lots of playability. The inclusion of an extra brick or two as cargo would have been nice, with this set on its own there&#39;s nothing to transport so I detracted one point for playability but who wouldn&#39;t have an extra brick and tile or so lying around?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A&nbsp;splendid example of what could be achieved with only 40 pieces, although for this amount of pieces it does look positively tiny it is quality that matters, not quantity :-)</p>
