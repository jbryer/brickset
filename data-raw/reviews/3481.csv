They were basically used as Police interceptors.  They have since been retired after faithful service and replaced with cars that look a little more realistic, but that's not to knock this set, it was good for its time.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It was an awesome set, it brings back memories looking at it's photos.  I still have some of its peices.  It was very, very compact, yet large and sturdy at the same time.  The motorbike is very nice to have.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:  Beautiful car design (Looks super fast!)
       Beautiful minifigs (add to your police squard)
       Beautiful colours and pieces (Love that 1 piece windscreen!)

Cons:  No speed radar? ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:

- Greatest bike design i've seen in the Police arsenal, simple and nice
- TWO minifigs, both great

Cons:

- I dont like the all-glass design of the car's top

Despite all this i really like this set, and its definitely staying in my LEGO city law enforcement brigade!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-09T09:41:35.62Z","LEGO Town (Police) - Speed Trackers Review","<p>This is a nice little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 62 pieces and it was 6.75 USD when it was on sale. This means that it was 11 cents per piece. It may be a little bit over the 10 cents per piece ratio but it's still worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set has two minifigs. Both cops have the same black overalls with the black shades on the face. The only difference between those guys is that one of them has a white helmet and the other one has brown hair.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we get a few stickers with this set. If you have a look at my pictures you'll notice that the stickers on this model are going to crumble away. Well, I have it for a long time but this is one of the main reasons why I don't like stickers...<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6625-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set has a very cool looking motorbike and a very nice looking car. The motorbike may be small but I really love the design of it. However: I like the motorbikes from the LEGO city theme more than this one. The car has a nice cockpit which you can open very easily. On the back of the car is also a place where you can put some stuff in. It's a very nice addition to any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I always remember having this set, so it was likely one of my first 10 and certainly a staple to&nbsp;<a href=""http://thelifeofkanebricks.blogspot.com/search/label/Kane%27s%20Town"" target=""_blank"">my town</a>. &nbsp;It remains one of only two pure Police sets I own, the other also being a 1996 release.<br />
<br />
This lovely Town set comes with 2 policemen, a police car, a police motorbike, and a couple accessories.<br />

<br />
It&#39;s no secret that the black sunglassed smiley print is my favorite head design and both cops feature it. &nbsp;They also both have the same uniform made of black legs and a zippered torso with police shield badge. &nbsp;Perhaps I just like what I grew up with, but I prefer this torso design to other modern ones.<br />

Looking at the car now, it certainly has a Pope-mobile feel to it, but I still find it a sleek model. &nbsp;A lot of the modern cars are bulky with huge wheels, so I&#39;m impressed with this low to the ground approach.&nbsp;<br />
The front window is hinged on, allowing very easy access to the inside of the car. &nbsp;There&#39;s a clamp to the back of the car to place the megaphone. &nbsp;I&#39;m assuming &nbsp;the small dark grey and black construction has something to do with the name of the set and perhaps is meant to be a speed gun. &nbsp;I would have just used the megaphone as the speed gun so maybe this mystery construction is a speed gun stand.&nbsp;<br />
Three &quot;police&quot; stickers go on the car. &nbsp;One for each side and one for the hood. &nbsp;The ones for the side will cover two bricks each, which is never ideal, but who would want to disassemble this car anyway?<br />

<br />
Best motorcycle ever. &nbsp;My version is fairly dusty, but you can still see how much thinner it is compared to modern bikes. &nbsp;I used the frame of this bike for years as a modified one for my favorite character. &nbsp;Seen here, it has a few lights, special police 1x2 printed tiles, and a lever. &nbsp;All perfect for driving around town and waiting several years before any official &quot;criminals&quot; arrive.&nbsp;<br />

"Rockstaar9","2020-05-19T15:24:13.473Z","Ouch","<p>Ouch. This is a really terrible set. The police van is just hideous, and the selection of minifigures&nbsp;is really sad. The two police officers are basically the same minifigure, and you can find those parts in any other set. The motorcycle is actually pretty good, but it&#39;s the only good part. The main problem is that the figure can&#39;t even fit inside the van! The trans blue slope piece is too low down, so the head of the officer can&#39;t fit! There&#39;s also a big gap in the seating area. The set almost feels unfinished.</p>
