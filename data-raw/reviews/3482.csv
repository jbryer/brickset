This is a inexpensive set costing less than $2.00 US dollars. I have a few other Artic sets and this is a nice addition to them. If you get into Artic good cheap set to add to the team.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO Arctic sets introduced us to a wonderful new animal piece, the LEGO Polar Bear, I think LEGO should bring that piece back in a special new set or even just re-release one of the larger Arctic sets as a new Legends set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Snow Scooter isn't much to talk about, it featured a small number of pieces in its build and one Mini-Figure with parka, but it was still a fun set. Alone though it isn't much, but if you included it with other Arctic sets you'd have a lot more fun than just this set alone. Although this was a cheap way to get some snow scooters and parkas to give to other LEGO Mini-Figures in your collection so you could start making a winter scene. If you can find a few of these for a good price I think they'd enhance any winter displays or even christmas ones.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,5
