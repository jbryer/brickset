"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-17T03:04:06Z","PERFECT Lego car!!","So ok, it's only a 1-seater, but this has to be the best lego car set ever produced!  This set is so fantastic I still have memories of the day I purchased this set (including the travel to get the set!)

The figure is a bit basic, but is a perfect example of a decent lego town figure.  Back in the 80's those cowboy hats were relatively rare, so it just added to this set's amazement. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Widdi","2007-02-11T12:07:12.773Z","Classic","I got this off ebay:
It is a nice little classic Town car. it has an Antenna, an opening hood and opening doors, which are really missing on the latest city sets. It has only one seat, but fits in any classic layout at 4-wide. The minifig has the classic smilie face common back then and some room for Moccing, since an engine is missing and it's a plain design.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"claherre","2008-12-27T19:29:09.373Z","A cowboy?","I really like this set, since I was a kid. It was for many years the only one with a cowboy! The opening hood only adds to its playability, but that antenna, It kept falling off...

Over the years, I replaced the pieces I lost, and know is finally complete. It's nice to have a minifig without one of the standard &quot;jobs&quot;.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p><strong>Cadillac</strong><br />
For an early set this remains one of the more stylishly&nbsp;coloured&nbsp;and designed to be remembered fondly, not only as an attractive vehicle but for its driver and features. My brother owned the set and it always stood out as &#39;the man in the cowboy hat&#39;s car&#39;. This stylish driver was in possession of this rare&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;head gear that we were not aware of existing in other sets and so he was quite an exciting character.</p>

<p>Add to this his beautiful black and red border convertible car, with radio aerial and opening bonnet no less, and it begins to stand out in the 1980 Town set list. The build is actually a straight forward ten stud length car chassis. Black elements build up wheel arches, sides and back in typical fashion until features such as the bonnet and aerial start to reveal something a little different. A hinge brick at the front and hey presto the bonnet actually opens! Now insert a comfortable yellow cruising seat.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Building</strong><br />
What must not get left out is the wonderful box photo of him diligently checking and tweaking his engine and the alternative builds on the instructions. Oh how we miss them! Here some really alright alternate models are shown. Often a bit naf and inferior, they here include a tiny car/buggy, a&nbsp;souped&nbsp;up sports car and a jack with a car very much i need of repair.</p>

<p><strong>Coupe De Ville</strong><br />
What makes it so good is in regard of the early period- it stretched the lower brick availability through unique design with a little charm and simple smart&nbsp;colour&nbsp;scheme. Perhaps the yellow seat suggests leather interior? Well it should suit him.&nbsp;Try and find instructions and have fun rebuilding this one. Modern City theme cars rely on a multitude more bricks and so should therefore be oozing style and charisma just like this gem.</p>

<p>Another all time favourite. Got it as an Xmas present 1981! In all the reviews on any Lego site anyone who had this set writes about how much trouble this little guy and his super cool black car got into, or how the Police always wanted to catch him and guess what? I agree! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind that classic sweet smiley face lurks a demon driver, a cheeky hellraiser with a need for speed! At one time he caused a MAJOR accident in my town racing a go-cart and the red car with ghetto blaster from the Shell Shop! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also refered to him simply as 'Cowboy Lego Man' when I was a kid and still do! Original was long lost, still have one mudguard, his hat&nbsp;the red chassis, and the yellow seat but a few years back nabbed a mint conditon on loose with original instructions off ebay at a way cool price. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Love it. Great car with that long lost classic Lego Town aesthetic, still love the opening hinged bonnet! </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Niki124","2021-02-03T21:02:36.763Z","An early classic","<p>This was another set my sister and I coveted for months (years?) before we were able to get our hands on it. Billed in UK catalogues at the time as the &quot;Roadster&quot;, this incorporated several features we loved which made Legoland novel and exciting for us. The moulded seat, the hinged hood, the front and rear lights, the little doors - if only the aerial didn&#39;t keep falling off!</p>

<p>We loved the minifigure too, the &quot;American Man&quot; as he became known to us. Driving round in a big shiny black car, he was our version of JR Ewing. We hoped more minifigures with stetsons would be released with future sets, but none appeared that we saw. But then again, if they had, maybe our American Man wouldn&#39;t have been so special.</p>

"80sbrickster","2017-03-03T16:46:22.233Z","An early classic","<p>This was my first ever Lego set with a mini figure&nbsp;and I was just ecstatic when I got it. Till I got this I had the large head figures handed down to me but this was just amazing to hold and play with. Every element in this set was new: The hinged opening car hood, the antenna at the back, the mudguards, actual headlights instead of the printed bricks I had till then...there was just so much packed into a single little set.</p>

<p>Many of the other vehicle sets at the time were not proportionate to the mini figures and the mini figures could not sit inside the vehicles...even when the set came with a mini figure.</p>

<p>I remember imagining the mini figure to be actually a sheriff because of the cowboy hat and the antenna on the car. This also gave me so many options to play with my existing bricks and helped me imagine a lot more. Over the next few years as I added to my collection of Legoland sets, the elements of this set continued to be played with and rearranged in many different ways.This set was an excellent starter set for Legoland Town!</p>

<p>Apart from the nostalgia of being the first Legoland Town set I got, this set also set in motion a love for Lego that continues and is very deserving of the 5 rating.</p>
