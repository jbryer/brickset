"BrickPiet44","2008-12-30T06:10:46.983Z","Nice little tow truck, not very special, with NO minifigure","The tow truck is quite simple. No extraâ€™s for this set. Not even a mini figure, which is a serious con.

The colour scheme is OK. A down side of the Shell cars is that colour schemes change every few years, so when you want to boy this be sure it matches your other Shell cars. Otherwise you have to rebuild the car to another colour scheme.  Which can be a problem if you do not have the right parts in the right colours.

Overall, this is an OK tow truck if you need one, but not a very special one.

The only downside is that, for some reason, it lacks a minifigure. Nonetheless it'll look great in any town setting, especially if you have any of the Shell garages from the late 70s to late 80s. It's worth picking up if you ever have the opportunity.",FALSE,4,4,4,3,5

The review's brick rating is always in my case reflective of the year. Of course more intricate and complex builds came since but the straight forward shape the new vehicles made at this time transformed the Town layout. It is well worth remembering also that solidly bricked vehicles were still being released this same year while this road rescue effort will of course happily take one driver (not supplied of course).</div><div><br></div><div>The cab rear window and roof hinge works well in many vehicles, quite an adaptable brick really.

What to choose? I did reckon my spare classic &#39;Shell&#39; Legoman with the Shell logo on his white top with blue pants and white cap would be perfect but then realised he&#39;s somewhere in storage...so I went for another figure I like very much..If you own 6541, 6512 or 6309 theres a guy like this:</font></p>

<p>I think he&#39;s perfect. If however, you fancy a bit of &#39;Classic Town Womens Lib&#39;, then the girl from 6380,</p>

<p>is <em>also </em>perfect...in fact, I had thought about coupling her with this tow truck but couldn&#39;t find one at a reasonable price so opted for the male figure...</p>

<p>I must add, like many other collectors, I do find it strange Lego didn&#39;t include a mini-figure, and that, with any Town type set, no figure at all isn&#39;t very enticing...However, this is such a classic design that its a must have purchase and would complement nicely the vintage:</p>

<p><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6610-1/Gas-Pumps"">http://brickset.com/sets/6610-1/Gas-Pumps</a></p>

<p>Incidentally, 6610 is my favourite set of <em>all</em> time (luckily I own a mint out of box copy again)...given that it was my very <em>first</em> set as a child way back in 1981...How time flies...</p>

"T79","2014-07-07T10:49:26.6Z","My first Shell tow truck... and no Shell minifigure","<p>If memory serves me right I got this when I was four years old, one day we stopped at a Shell station to fill up the car and&nbsp;well, you can see where this is going: they had this set for sale. I don&#39;t remember much of the remainder of the ride as I was too busy&nbsp;building this tow truck.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Another example of lost instructions, which makes it a bit more satisfying to actually be able to build it again after all this time. Back in those days&nbsp;there was no internet,&nbsp;even finding a picture of a set could be difficult&nbsp;once it stopped appearing in the catalogue, let alone the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A pair of car doors with printed shell logo and a plate with ladder are the best parts here, although I also liked the&nbsp;red 4 x 5 wheel guard. The black hook has sadly long since broken, and gluing it only worked as long as all you did was watch... which of course never happened. Strangely I still have the bits so I could still glue it again (and see it broken again by eager little hands).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None. Which at the time I got this was annoying as I did not have that many minifigures to begin with, and certainly none in Shell colours. Later on it did not matter anymore as there were more than enough lying around, but if this is all you have it can be frustrating.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Laying plates on top of each other, ending with three big pieces: the hinged roof and rear window, windscreen and tow hook. It&#39;s still nice how they create a&nbsp;nine stud long vehicle with a 2 x 8 plate and that wheel guard though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While the cab is sufficient the business end of the tow truck is&nbsp;rather bare: a red platform with the yellow tow hook. One nice thing compared to some other&nbsp;tow trucks: this one at least has big wheels and because of that looks a lot bigger and heavier than for example the&nbsp;tow truck from #6371.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A rather mediocre tow truck, of which only the memories are really the saving grace. Still, with an additional car and minifigure it still is very playable (as the broken hook - again, I did glue it - can testify), the two bricks for playability I gave is for the truck on its own. And compared to its contemporaries it&#39;s not that bad, really, the big wheels definitely help here.</p>
