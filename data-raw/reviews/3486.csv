It has some nice detail/special part, that in the end aren't that hard to come by. (doors with red cross). 

I wonder why Lego didn't just re-release the doctors car from the paramedic unit with a different minifig..... (so you have 2 identical doctors cars in town (would look prettier in my opinion)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<br />
I can&#39;t actually be objective, I love this set, built it so many times, used its parts in so many ways in my early mocs.<br />
<br />
The red cross printed hood 2x2 tile, the printed doors and the minifigure&#39;s torso were marking the beginning of an evolution back in the early 80s, along with the systematic use of yellow, red and blue transparent 1x1 plates in all kinds of vehicles</p>

<p>This is one of the very first Legoland sets containing a female minifigure with those iconic hair pigtails.<br />
<br />
I only wish Lego would produce new Classic Town theme vehicles.. All the 4-wide cars and trucks/lorries fit so much better on the still existing road plates.<br />

C ya guys&nbsp; :-)</p>
