"folkform","2006-07-16T22:34:49Z","Great early construction.","This was one of my earliest sets.  However, it is a great example of lego construction using the most basic bricks and plates.  The special pieces like the grill and the loader attachment give this set just enough to keep it from looking generic.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Citizen_Piper","2011-08-23T00:44:06.31Z","the little set with special elements","This set holds a special place in my city because it introduced me to new special elements -- despite having collected lego for almost 30 years the yellow bucket and red arm lifter remain one of a kind pieces.  It could also be noted that this set has the ""big tires"" of that era, perhaps one of the last sets to come out with the standard red rims and metal axle instead of what we now see today where the tires come off from the assembly. The man in blue is generic enough so he can work well with other sets yet distinguishable from the others because of the white outline print. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-09-24T04:49:34.99Z","Chunky Little Digger","I think Lego used to release sets for longer and its a shame that maybe through demand, distribution speed and production limitations they only last a couple of years at most nowadays. I suspect this because I got this set new Christmas 1984. Other sets were also available sometimes several years after their release.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b><br><div><ul><li>Construction workman with blue shirt print, jeans and a red hard hat.</li></ul></div><div><b>Daily Graft</b></div><div>Its a very good set; the original blue shirted workman has a spanner for the digger and a handy shovel, the yellow beacon light looks great on the black rails, the front grill looks great, black on construction yellow and the whole design is solid and chunky. The red bucket arms were an inventive piece and the bucket can scoop small bricks.</div><div><br></div><div>The build is brief but firm and makes a reliable model that is a happy pocket money set to be held by little hands or placed within a scene or layout for construction. The rear black bars can be knocked off but sitting them on top is not otherwise an issue. The mini ladder and grill piece performs well here as the latter, the overall completeness of character, tools, vehicle and job made simple and very effective.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Forgot Your Flask?</b></div><div>Town essentials probably include at least one construction set. This one is highly recommended. As usual though I can't help but add that he looks like he could do with a brew. A mug and milk, two sugars please!</div></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Legolandcollector1978_1990","2022-05-10T22:00:47.563Z","LEGO set 6630","<p>I really like this set even though it&#39;s a very small one with not to many parts, it is still very fun to build and play with, if you have other construction sets, but stand alone it&#39;s okay. You can easily get this set for very cheap and the parts aren&#39;t really expensive, so it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;re collecting the town sets or if you need a small construction vehicle with a scoop.</p>
