"Mawich","2010-04-23T23:34:59.077Z","An impulse buy","This was one of those set I got which wasn't tied to a birthday or Christmas.&nbsp; It was one of the smallest Lego Town sets released in 1985 but it packed a lot of punch.&nbsp; <br><br>For some reason I really enjoyed playing with construction related sets and when I saw this sitting on a shelf at the local department store I had to get it.&nbsp; My dad didn't mind relenting to my request because it was only a few dollars, but had some explaining to do to mum when we came home!<br><br>The set was a scaled down version of 6686 (Backhoe) which was released a couple of years before.&nbsp; It had a number of nice little details such as road barricade (which was a standard design for sets during that era), the printed grill on the 2x2 slope (no stickers here!) and the gear stick which made an introduction in 1985.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5

<p>It looked good with all its wheels, its ability to swivel and flexible bucket.</p>
<p>Had great playabilty for its size.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Niki124","2023-02-19T20:40:44.037Z","Small but well-formed","<p>For a relatively small vehicle, this has a lot of parts, so there&#39;s enough detail to keep a seasoned builder interested in assembling the vehicle step-by-step, and also to create alternative designs. As ever, when we bought this set, part of the appeal was in having a new or innovative piece, in this case the gear lever. The minifigure is well-designed and co-ordinates well with the vehicle in his black dungarees. Definitely a well-considered piece issued at a time when variety and innovation in construction vehicles was necessary.&nbsp;</p>
