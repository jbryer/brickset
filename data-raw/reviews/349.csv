The good things about it are the red number 3 slope peice, the rear engine bulid, the race driver, and the chase plate.  I guess the only bad thing is, it's a small set.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>If you got the red #3 race car that came out in '88, this is a little redundant as it's almost, but not quiet the same model and design. But it's alright though if you didn't get that set from '88. If you liked the race subtheme of Town, this is good too, a way to build up having a lot of cars to use for a track.</p>

<p>What made it good for me is the helmet on the minifig, this was a new styling with visors that me and cousins wanted to get and play with.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3

<p>Racing drivers of all sorts are rarely too exciting but this one is reasonable&nbsp;with the &#39;S&#39; and diagonal stripe top for a white bodysuit. The black helmet is a nice choice (there are always spare visors leaving our boxes awash with them!).</p>

I like many small racers and cars/ go-karts and this one is no exception. While some were a little lacking, I found this one to have an excellent engine with vents and a &#39;camera&#39; piece. The raised slope gave the impression of housing for a chunky engine while providing a head rest. I do not think the front or sides were that great though in finish and a complete or thicker cockpit in general is a bit better.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was probably my brothers and I am just&nbsp; jealous of that engine and the colour&nbsp;scheme was really good. In a line up for Lego Town races, its always nice to get a sequence of numbers so this is another choice for a &#39;3&#39; if you like red and white or a spoiler and engine feature.</p>

<p>Pocket money well spent.</p>

"medleyj","2020-04-30T19:57:45.593Z","simple race car with a basic minifig","<p>the simple red race car is from a simpler time. The only special piece is the #3 slope piece acting as a hood for the front of the car. The basic minifig has a basic 1980&#39;s helmet. In the end it&#39;s a small little car that is simple to build but could have lots of playability once you build your racetrack. can also be used as a go-cart since it&#39;s rather small and would probably fit into the go-cart category based on the much larger year 2000+ car models that are 6 or 8 studs wide.&nbsp;</p>
