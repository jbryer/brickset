The opening top hatch of the car makes the car an open-top vehicle. The front grille is in two colors which looked funny but I think it was supposed to represent striped decals. Also, the set is named without a thought put into it. A family car? The car can barely fit two minifigs let alone a normal family of four. The car design is typical for the Classic Town series so it is nothing spectacular.
