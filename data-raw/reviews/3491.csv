The wheels are small compared to the sets out now but are in proportion to the car. I love the doors that open out on these older sets. Good little set if you come across one good to add to your collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legofan5445","2008-02-09T01:22:26.747Z","Great Car! ","Lego, please bring back the classic cars like this! Looks nice, take away the decals, and you have a regular sedan car! I personally like these cars to the newer generation ones, which look too fierce for the road... 

Pros:
Design! 
Shell Color scheme, which is now long-lost... 

Cons:
Decals... 
The higher rear wheels, but i modified mine so it's ok...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-18T11:47:29.253Z","Winning Style","1986 is one of a couple of interesting years that feature distinct contrasts in released models, the design and parts of some sets appearing more primitive than others. As an example this Shell stock car is a superior design to a formula 1 counterpart of the same year.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路][</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4></div><div>White 'S' outfit with the stripes and a red helmet.</div><div><br><div><div><b>Top Stock</b></div>The white driving suit looks fine to go with the car while the original and versatile red helmet can protect the driver from the hazards of driving or apparently from the vacuum of the cosmos - see Space theme!&nbsp;The 'S' torso: a clever design as it can suit Shell sets but who knows what it stands for, you decide as usual. We can only assume that the red and black diagonal stripes matched 1980s minifigure bedroom wallpaper.</div><div><div><br></div><div>The Racing subtheme is a wonderful collection of cars of all sorts that bring some colourful patterns, action and imaginary engine power to the town roads. As far as stock, rally or high performance standard cars go, this model seems a real winner. Its easy to get nostalgic and biased, so a quick look around alternatives in the subtheme often give a more balanced review. In this instance only 1496 and 1497 have comparable cars so these three should make a nice collection for a race without the domination of F1. Which car here is best is probably more down to personal favourite.</div><div><br></div><div>The most likeable part of the build could be the simple raised rear end of the vehicle that gives a basic but effective design of increased suspension or even engine size. A clever illusion if you like. I have no love of corporate sponsorship but being pre-Octan, this is a great colour scheme with the yellow and red stripes complementing the white really well. The Shell badge, name and '16' at least look smart but the red line does not quite continue within the back bumper area.</div><div><br></div><div>Lights are displayed across the front in two types; yellow and clear while the back only needs the x2 chunky red. Blue tinted windscreens and white hubcaps made this a pleasure to purchase, now a prized part of any racing collection, lets hope many survived intact. There is no seat by the way so this is obviously a rough ride for the driver, naturally the roof is hinged for access.</div><div><br></div><div>This is almost practically a five brick set except for respecting the difference between 'best of theme' as opposed to 'nostalgic favourites'. Such treasures deserve a higher score though for possessing unique and benchmark status. There are better four stud cars but not many better in racing. Oh go on then, its also among the best four stud cars, five bricks it is!</div></div></div>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,4
"myater","2010-06-10T20:29:12.683Z","Great City/Town Car","<p>I loved this little set when growing up, even if it was my brothers.&nbsp; We had several cars and used the instructions to build even more cars of different colors to race with.&nbsp; When I was given all the legos this was one of the sets that I found the instructions for as well as all the parts with the stickers on them.&nbsp; We got lucky with our set and ended up with two sets of stickers.&nbsp; I liked them so much that I finagled the other sheet from my brother to apply to my 6698 set which has them still today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you like the stickers or not, this is/was a great classic car with an easy but fun build, and loads of playability with the repeatable instuctions.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"James83","2012-07-14T11:28:46.683Z","Tin Top Racing","<p>This was my most favourite racing car I owned. It wasn't the greatest ever car Lego designed but it had style.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This could have been any standard Town set car and is pretty basic and easy to build. However, it has some nice touches, the clear headlights and circular yellow foglights, rasied rear wheels to give it a daring racing look, sporty red steering wheel, number stickers for the doors and Shell stickers. The red and yellow colour scheme was quite eye-catching too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>An early typical racer with the printed S racing gear and an early-style visorless helmet that looked the part, being more like the kind of gear worn by rally drivers in that era.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>When this came out, I was enthralled by the rally cars of the period, Lancias, Audi Quattros and Peuguot 205s. This was <em>my </em>own Lego rally car. Eventually I jacked up the front wheels with a 2x2 flat plate to match those at the back for increased ground clearance and had hours of fun racing this over the carpet. Also the basic design was so good that you could copy it as a town saloon or make other competitors for races in other colour combinations. A real treasure, a basic set but one that had endless hours of fun in it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,4
"DanMiles83","2013-05-13T19:37:16.457Z","This is where I all began","Age 3, Christmas 1986 I received this set from my older cousin as a gift, Lego. Never before did I have any lego. Once I figured out how to put it together, with help from Dad of course it became the number 1 play toy. All I wanted for any birthday, Christmas or anything else after for that matter was Lego. I still have fond memories of that car, I lost the instructions years ago but I'm pretty sure I still have all the pieces, writing this review is making me want to go get my lego out and try and build this set again...<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
