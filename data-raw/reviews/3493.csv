Featuring no innovations and old style of building, this still nice, with useful pieces and is good to any town collection, because was cheap (now is a rare set). The building involved, above a long plate, have basically, a several part on the back of the vehicle (on the front, there is only a piece with two wheels under), that have some blocks with triangular shape, and the pilot stay on a basic cockpit, covered in a little part near the legs, with blocks and a red plate under. On the back, there are big wheels, good designed and useful for any other cars, and also is a back spoiler, well made. The color scheme is basic and good. The minifigure icluded is too simple designed, but it still in a nice style of lego minifigures from the 1990's years. Altough the set is small, this old is another good to increase more your lego town, or cars, this set is well made altough basic and is now a rarity.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

If you compare this dragster with the dragsters we've seen in the LEGO Town (Race) theme, you'll notice that this version looks much smaller than the ones from the LEGO Town (Race) theme.<br></span></p>

"James83","2013-01-05T06:29:41.523Z","New-Style Drag Racer","<p>Lego has developed several drag racer models over the years and nearly all looked the same. This one was a little different, and was actually one of the last Town sets I ever brought before Town went very basic and childish from 1995 onwards. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>Most Lego dragsters tended to look very basic being a combination of a long 2x12 brick with two small wheels, one sloped brick with a printed number, steering wheel and then two larger rear wheels and a spoiler. Fairly basic and boring. This model builds on that method but has some nice touches and looks quite mean with its black and red colours. The forward wheels are slightly wider than the older 2x2 integrated wheel units (but mine were very squeaky), the driver's position is wider with four sloped bricks (side number stickers) and a steering wheel. The use of much larger technic wheels at the rear with those cool tyres made this look like a proper dragster with some real power! This effect was enhanced by the engine which was quite large for a smaller model like this and with hinges for a V-12 effect and a smooth round 2x2 brick on top as a carburettor. Two small round bricks mimic the rear suspension and the rear also features the realistic features of smaller wheel to limit the amount of rearward angle when the nose rises. The spolier was standard with a 'Turbo' sticker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>The driver was a newer-style figure with a sunglasses head, red legs and&nbsp;a red Octan racing suit body and a red helmet with stars and black visor. He looked better than older racing drivers. He also had a full set of tools, these were the first, and only set, of new-style Lego tools I acquired. The six tools come in a little rack and they looked good and much more realistic than the old black spanner and&nbsp;hammer. It was almost worth getting the set for those alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>I didn't really use this set much as a drag racer. It was the best drag racer in terms of realism and detailing but they weren't really my favourite racers. Overall its a good set which looks good and is sturdy and does everything it sets out to do.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
