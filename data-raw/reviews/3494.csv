A satisfying keeper for the Town roads, this particular truck possesses good points all over:</div><div><ul><li>Chunky yellow one stud tube 'suspension'</li><li>White cab and hinged sun roof.</li><li>Radio antennae and flood lights rigged on a solid safety/passenger bar.</li><li>Large technic style wheels with solid axles.</li><li>Grey 'metal' engine, front bar-bumper and grill.</li><li>Rear pick up box for holding a couple of small bricks if wanted.</li><li>'Cool as brick' driver.</li></ul><div>The black car chassis performs as a strong base for the entire build and gives a suitably chunky feel to all dimensions of the vehicle, definitely made for MF drivers. Yellow headlights are not everyones favourites but add to a very smart colour mix and complement the red. Flat red lights are built strongly on to that chassis, leaving the bay area at the back utilising some nice smooth tiles.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Those axles are satisfying to build and are solidly held by the two stud hole bricks, smooth running and motion ensured. This fine model has good action and chunky rubber tyres, no wait thats chunky everything.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Unbreakable</b></div><div>No doubt among favourites and almost a best. Some sets are hard to part with or break up and maybe this is such an example. No alternate builds improve it and the character of the MF and truck are memorable and welcome in modern scenes too.&nbsp;A top torso and a top truck.</div></div></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3

This set is one of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>At first you'd think with is a fairly basic vehicle. However it has style, engine parts stick up out of the bonnet, wicked blue and red paint job, sunroof, rollbar with extra lights and antennas, space for groceries in the back, chunky double wheels with some Technic elements, yellow tube bricks to represent suspension and a mud guard at the front. That's a lot of features to cram into such a small vehicle. The use of smooth flat bricks at the back is another neat touch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>This lucky driver has a cool truck logo printed top, blue jeans and a red baseball cap. This figure is rare and was a treasured addition to my population. This clean-shaven guy just loves to rip up the countryside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>As a weekend fun machine its classic. It has all the features you'd expect and the detailing is great, even down to the suspension. The wheels are massive and really give you the impression of a serious mud-moving machine. Sadly driving it around town was a bit clumsy (it always outran the law though!) and eventually I removed the chunky wheels and replaced them with normal wheels to make it into a pick-up truck. Other than that change, I never broke this set up. The driver later gained a stubled sunglasses-wearing head, but was never parted from his beloved truck.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
