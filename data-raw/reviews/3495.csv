In my opinion this one looks better than 6664, but is at a normal size for one officer. Many later released helicopters are much larger, but also provide only space for one minifig. 
It fits perfectly to my harbour police station 6540",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

After resently digging out the old bricks, this was one of the first sets i assembled, although, unfortunatly i am missing a few pieces, so, i had to be creative, and i think it turned out well. :)

Anyway, i loved this set as a kid, and i still love it today. Not as flimsy as many of the other police choppers, and i really think it looks great, even today. It has high design quality, and is a great addition to any lego town police force. :) The only problem is, that the landing gear is a bit fragile, when  used ""harshly"". But, this is also the case with many other helicopters, so it's really not i big deal, just be aware of it, when you let the kids play with the set.

It has been great fun to dig out the bricks, and assembling the sets, after about 10 years in the attic. Now i am seriously considering hunting down more of the classic town sets, an building my own little Lego town. :)

Anyway, awesone set, classic piece of Lego history. If you are looking to expand your town police force, this set is worth considering!  5/5.

I don't intend them for keeping as other new police helicopters are preferable but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this set as it is a really good brief build.</p>

Control sticks are placed really well in front of the seat area and the plexiglass bubble that is white plate hinged gives all round vision and a neatly consistent Police look. Black slanted bricks flank the open sided cockpit and connect back with white bricks to form a solid body with two window panels. This suggests the possibility of a larger helicopter that can take more MFs but is more decoration and works very well too. The pilot sits well in the cockpit and has plentiful room.&nbsp;Searchlights look good folding down at the front on a hinged white brick and white plates and rails make a really good base and landing gear. I prefer a bit more black on Police vehicles but this is obviously a clean looking and attractive design. The tail is strong and holds a black slanted brick at the end and a small propeller piece.</span><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""arial"" size=""2""><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana""><br></p><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana""><b>Sky Patrol</b></p><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Verdana"">The top holds brilliant engine exhausts -twin coned one stud bricks held horizontally and projecting backwards obviously. Pleasant smooth transparent lights feature on the tail, and the port side, starboard red and green over the cockpit with a black smooth plate. These smooth plates also make excellent propellers, better without studs if not as lovably chunky. They look great and complete the smooth shape overall but lack just the finishing touch of two more two stud plates on the remaining cross part of the propeller base brick. It turns well but would have had a polished finish with that extra form.&nbsp;It holds out though as a good Police helicopter but by no means the best helicopter generally. Priced £2.75 at the time though it was a fair buy. A popular bit of Police kit.</p></font>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,3
