"James83","2012-07-17T17:10:09.413Z","Ready For Anything","<p>The Fire Chief was a lucky man in 1988 with Set 6505 Fire Chief's Car and this go anywhere vehicle. It remains one of my favourites and is an essential item if you have Set 6358 Snorkel Squad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This is a very sturdy and chunky all-terrain vehicle long before the world gripped by SUV mania. It has chunky wheels, high ground clearance, bull bars on the front which adds some realism, a printed fire logo brick, opening roof with a large blue light bar, radio antenna and an opening tailgate with window. The tailgate also holds the brake lights and blank flat brick number plate area. The rear of the vehicle can stow some hand held gear and has twin windows on each side. Again it's the touches of realism that make this more than a standard car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>A fireman with printed tunic and white helmet. With this set the Fire Chief has an oxygen pack, axe and fire extinguisher. All these can be carried in the back. As with Set 6505 this Chief looks like any other fireman. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>This vehicle remained intact for years. It was hard to break this set down because the basic vehicle is so good. Its incredibly sturdy and has one of the highest ground clearances of any jeep of its era. It can really go anywhere and its so flexible and can stow so much gear that it's an essential fire support vehicle. This is a vehicle that gives the Fire Chief some serious kudos. </p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,4

"George_Legoman","2018-10-18T13:31:58.643Z","Great looking Off-Road Fire Truck","<p>This off road fire chief&#39;s vehicle is one of the most representative 4-wide trucks from the Legoland, Classic Town themed sets at its best.<br />
<br />
Great combination of colours and playability with opening front doors, rear door with large clear space view by the huge glass and a front opening roof, holding the Dark Blue Transparent 1x1 plates as emergency lights.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very nice classic fireman minifigure as well with a white helmet, the ax, the airtank utensil and the white fire extinguisher. Note that the fire chief can carry all the above on himself and the fire truck has enough space to store all this gear easily.</p>

<p>Great detail: the front Old Light Grey winch installed on the front bumper, looking so realistic!</p>

<p>Although it was supposed to be a common set during the late 80s, somehow it became one of the - hard to find - Town sets growing its value for money, especially as a sealed box in comparison to such a small set.</p>

<p>By all means a great addition to Classic Town Fire Department vehicles, very look alike to even later built 4x4 trucks of this type!</p>
