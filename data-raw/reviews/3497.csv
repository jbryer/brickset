"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-30T06:41:55Z","Good old classic town","This is another nice set from the great 80s to early 90s town range. As most of my other old (pre 1996) sets it's not assembled but somewhere in my lego boxes.
Now to the review:
It's a classic LEGO town style car with a trailer and a classic motorbike. There's one classic grin minifig that drives both vehicles included. He can choose between a cap and a helmet. Too bad that the helmet seems to hang unstable on the motorbike if the minifig drives the car. This can cause, that the helmet falls on the street. And in the small car isn't enough room to transport the helmet. The car has even a small spoiler, which makes it rather sporty.
All over it's a solid 8/10 for this LEGO town classic.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-07T10:28:03Z","Brings a Tear to My Eye","I've only reviewed a few sets so far and this is the first ten I've given out. Only really because it was the first set I got ever. I still remember it like it was yesterday, it was 1991, my third birthday. No present I got on that day caught my attention more than that little roadster on motocross bike on the trailer. Since that day I've only had eyes for one toy.
This set is one of the coolest I've ever owned (out of about 250 not including more than one of the same set) and I've had it built up for the last 6 or so years for nostalgic purposes. It still amazes the level of detail and quality of construction that is found, even in the tiny sets, of the early 1990's. If you can get this set do so cause it just looks great. It's also one of the only sets with a black motorcycle in it (4563 is the only other set I can think of with one.)
In conclusion if whoever the guy was whose helmet fell off the front of the motorcycle obviously isn't doing it right coz I've never had that problem.

"suckerpunch83","2009-02-24T09:36:03.747Z","Perfect Small Set","This set has been on my wanted list for a while. It was never available in my area, but thanks to eBay I am an owner and it didn't let me down. 

Any set that includes 2 vehicles is a plus, and the trailer is a nice added touch. The car itself is perfect with the Legoland theme of the 80's and 90's and is built well, and who can ever have too many motorbikes?

If you don't own this set, get it!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

I love the trailer and the black motorcycle is hard to come by. Standard older mini fig. can drive the car or the motorbike, has helment and a cap to swap out. The car is a typical car of the late 80's early 90's Town series with the doors that do actually open and close. Great classic set I am proud this one is in my collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-02-25T20:34:08.857Z","Car, Bike, and Trailer all in one set","This is a rare sight to see all three in one set. The motorcycle is very cool and I wish Lego brought this back instead of making some shady looking bike. The car is also very cool because it's in four wide scale and I always like those cars. The trailer is the weakest part of the set, but not by much. Overall, this set is great and should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BobyDick","2007-08-21T14:16:14.77Z","very sweet","i really love this set... maybe one reason is that is one of my very first sets...  

i really like the trailer, it is very nice... than is the motorcycle which is cool (and rare i think because in all my lego collection it is the only one i have). the car looks very sport, even is so small and has so few bricks...

in the end, i rate 9/10 this set... just take look ...how sweet can be this small set... with very few bricks, but it look so nice. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2009-12-14T19:24:16.39Z","Great set","I see that this set has some reviews already, but i wan't to voice my oppinion as well.

Dude out for some weekend fun, in his sportscar, and with his bike on the trailer. What's not to like about it?

Awesome set, i've had a lot of fun with this in my childhood years. The car look's amazing, the classic bike, well, that's always a plus, and the trailer, wich is a bit odd, a bit rare, and a bit.. well.. yellow, hehe.

Overall the set is a bit special, simply because of the trailer and bike. Wish there were more sets like this.

Oh, and of course it hase nice design quality, it's not flimsy or anything, so, i would recommend this set for any 90's lego town. :)

4/5

"AETerry","2011-02-07T17:57:44.527Z","Road Rebel Review","<p>I've got three Town sets that are a vehicle and motorcycle set. The other two are 6654 Motorcycle Transport and 6677 Motocross Racing. There is a newer set introduced in 2012 that's 4433 Dirt Bike Transport that's larger then the other three.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was one of those card board boxes, really small and easy for either storing your set back in if so inclined or just toss into the recycle bin. The instructions are on a folded sheeted of paper that's illustrated on both sides with easy to follow step-by-step. One other really unique piece is the red sloping brick piece with the ""tire rims"" for the car. That introduced a new look to the vehicles of it's time with a more sporty and sleek look.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's 68 pieces. At the time, it was easy to pick this up for the new black motorcycle, the style of helmet introduced then was also fairly new with the visors that come down as the older helmets were being phased out now.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You've got just one minifigure, who sports a blue cap and has a black helmet he can switch out to and wear. The torso has a S over one side and some ""racing stripes"" that LEGO used for their sports look and stock car racers.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>As a small set, these are easy to build and put together. They're not really that complicated. Though it's great to have more cars to fill out a city with and I liked the idea of another motorcycle to build on a Dirt Bike Race track theme with.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>And what can I say, this set of the three, while the newest (from the Town Theme) has a red sports car hauling around a sleek black motorcycle on a yellow trailer. You can't beat a solid build and fun play with the minifigure driving out to do some dirt bike racing. This is one of the few sets I know of to feature the black motorcycle, so getting it for that is well worth it. Lots of playability with it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
