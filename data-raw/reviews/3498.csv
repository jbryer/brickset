Overall, its all good! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Some other models look a little better, but at least this one had two figures to get the job done.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-30T05:56:11.78Z","LEGO Town is  a Clean Town","Another one of my old classics I got when I was really young. We don't have anything like this here in Australia so I always thought it was awesome. The model is well designed with great features. The front sweeper turns side to side and moves up and down. The top has an opening sunroof and a vacuum on the side. The back has a scoop shovel for sweeping rubbish into the compartment. Tail lights, top flashing light, opening doors and twin mini-figs make this model an absolute gem.

The mini-figs are in blue suits with white caps. They also have a brown broom each. Their faces are the plain standard faces.

Overall a great model with no flaws and a must for all LEGO towns. I feel this model is a 7/10 and very suited to any old school collector or a lover of the town series. A must have.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-12T01:25:32.513Z","The Previous Street Sweeper","This vehicle is responsible for paving way to our modern Street Sweeper that most of us City lovers have today. Even though the newer version received better response and ratings from fans, this version has more charm to it. First, it comes with two minifigs. There is nothing better than receiving two minifigs when you know only one can drive the Street Sweeper. Also I wish they retained the sunroof in this version on the newer version. They took it off to maintain realisticness, true, because why would street sweepers need a sunroof? Also this Street Sweeper has a yellow/red color scheme while the new one has an all-yellow color scheme.

There are very few flaws, a trait few sets have, and i just feel it has what a set needs.
