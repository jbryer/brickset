Quite a claim so see if you agree why.</div><div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Red leather jumpsuit?</li></ul>The solo driver looks excellent, zipped up safe in his leathers with a cool white helmet and visor for extra protection while driving his brick beast of a vehicle.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Jesus Built My Hotrod</b></div><div>The build is slim and reasonably long but features some nice ideas that are unique and quirky. The reused big wheels and small wheels combo makes a good hot rod or custom car when positioned carefully so the slant or rise can accommodate the car chassis and stop it scraping on the road. White hubcaps blend with the overall smart white scheme and the proportions look right from the ground up.</div><div><br></div><div>The main chassis appears red and gets a bar/plate of blue on each underside that starts the wonderful North American theme in red, white and blue. Standard bricks build up with some side plates to allow the driver to fit in with the steering wheel. At the rear a first unusual design is the excellent use of window arches for long, slim wheel arches. It sits on these fine and makes a truly different four stud machine for your roads. The front angle plate allows extremely low to road building and one of the most interesting ideas; solidly yellow headlights next to the grey grill. It seems to bravely work very well in this design, a thumbs up for that. It also has a top smooth plate like a forward spoiler. The rear angle plate gets the necessary transparent red lights and looks really cool.</div><div><br></div><div>Moving up is the monster of an engine; two red grill topped grey hinge bricks accompanied by grey clip plate held, mammoth exhaust pipes! Twin red 'cups' also form two large pistons or valves? At other times available in chrome, those large exhausts are a superb addition that breaks the design out in to new territory without overdoing one-piece building components. They sweep back past a cool, low, light blueish windscreen, a blue rugged safety bar and on to the back where the crowning glory is topped, raised by the wheels: A hinged spoiler made with printed, smooth plates in white stars and stripes on blue and red.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Dream Machine</b></div><div>This excellently designed car has some straight forward but effective changes that set it apart not only from standard car designs but from the racing subtheme. The car is as much a character as the driver who provides excitement and fun colours for kids and remains a very worthwhile collectable for AFOLs. The set suggests that the car is not only for racing or hot rod hobbies but for the sheer enjoyment of transport in an amazing machine.&nbsp;Sometimes Lego inadvertently made their own heroes: models and characters that became long term favourites through the large appeal of a well executed design. This seat mounted engine is no exception and deserves a place in the top ten of Town vehicles.</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

Mainly because I&#39;ve always found 6646 rather... well, bland. And that&#39;s coming from a self-confessed fan of good old bland vanilla ice cream. The thing with plain gelato though is that you know exactly what you&#39;re getting - so your expectations are set accordingly. Which is certainly not the case with a set bearing a name that literally screams (in your face).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think that this little Classic Town dragster fails to live up to its exciting (?) name. Contrary to other reviewers, I never really warmed up to the offish design and was quick to take it to pieces. The attempt to bridge &quot;4-wide&quot; and &quot;6-wide&quot; vehicle design in recreating a classic dragster&#39;s streamlined physique is commendable - but, at least in my eyes, none too successful. Having said that, once the set went to the parts bin, I found that its value dramatically increased - the side pipes were a relatively rare part which could be put to good use in any creation with ties to internal combustion. The printed tiles were downright rare - and rather attractive, especially in the context of Americana patriotism - so bonus points to 6646 for making those available at a knock-off price.</p>

<p>Overall, I find that the universally un-loved yellow tiles for headlights are a rather fitting allegory for the whole set: remember, a drag-strip racing machine as the one that 6646 is trying to recreate would have precious little use for headlights - and therefore does not usually have those to begin with... In the same fashion, the Screaming-Texas-Tornado-Patriot is something a Classic Town could easily do without, especially seeing as the drag racing theme was not revisited for quite a while. The set&#39;s saving grace is the uniqueness and usefulness of its limited part selection which turns it into a great donor pack for car MOCs.</p>

If Mr Brick seems bored get him out in this!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>Where to start on this amazing creation? Well, it looks the part, every brick seems to scream raw power. The engine is fairly basic, but then its a small set, but the grills on the hinges conjur up the image of a Vee-engine pretty well. Those exhausts are just perfect and the wine goblet air intakes look great too. The curving exhasuts seem to make the body curve too and the large wheelarches at the back complete the effect. The rear also features more grills, the driver a&nbsp;low, sleek windscreen and a roll-over bar and the Stars and Stripes spoiler complete the&nbsp;racer perfectly. The chunky rear wheels give a good nose-down attitude too.&nbsp;When you see the instructions you think this is a pretty basic and easy set with few bricks. That is true, but the bricks are used in&nbsp;such a way&nbsp;that they work wonders. My only bugbear is the two yellow fake lights on the front, either they should have been real lights (which I added on mine) or&nbsp;removed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The lucky dude racing this monster has a red zipped racing suit with matching legs and a white helmet with a blue visor. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>I never broke this set down. First, becuase it was so cool, and second, becuase many of its elements weren't suited to non-racing cars. Those exhausts look a bit out of place on a typical town car! A great classic with ingenious use of the bricks to design and build a genuine hot-rod racer, whose originality was unsurpassed for several years. A must have set!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
