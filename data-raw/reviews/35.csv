It's like going back to my childhood cause this was the first lego castle set I owned!(6074) Sure, the castle design is not very good, but there is a good number of minifigs and the ultra cool yellow wall piece! And the knights are way better than those to be released in 2004! Hooray! Now i own another legend set, apart from the guarded inn! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Lord Penguin has right, There are 2 short swords in old light grey who are a bit strange but that doesn't matter. There are much castle walls and 2 45 degrees castle walls inthis set and they are great. Only  the corners on the 2 towers on front are a bit hooky (I don't know the word for it) I t is painfull when you move youre hand to fast across it, and that's not good for a childrens toy. But it's a great set. More castles to come legend I hope.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set though is interesting, thanks to the corner/45&#186; bricks which have been used to an amazing effect to form the towers on either side of the drawbridge.  The obvious good thing about this set that makes it stand out from the rest is the balcony and house with steeple and the yellow wall near the back.  This forces the castle to &quot;unlock&quot; unsymmetrically which is a good thing.

However, there are a few things missing from the design - there's no porticullis for starters and the drawbridge is manually raised and lowered without the use of a winch.  Also there are only two knights in this set and a minimal amount of other soldiers.  In the looks department, the corner walls and the yellow wall gives the castle its character, but it also allows the designer to take short cuts in the design - there are no stairs or ladders in this castle.  And just below the balcony, there seems to be pillar holding up nothing which is odd.  This castle is definately not a replacement for the earlier one (6073) but it looks sleeker and less square-ish and the facade is more symmetrical.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-07-18T21:00:51.467Z","WOW!","the black falcons fortress is one of the best legends sets. its two horses stand out in a crowd, and all the other figs all have weapons. IT DOES NOT COME WITH A KING!   The drawbridge would be really hard for some 5-7 year old with its nots and all. you might want to build it on a base plate so that you can put scenery inside (there is nothing inside it). now on to the little house. it acts as a shelter and comes with a strange piece.  YOU COULDNT GET BETTER FOR $50!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
