"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T21:33:21Z","","A great little M:Tron vehicle. Comes with the standard transparent neon green pieces that make the M:Tron line one of the best space themes ever. Pretty expensive on its on, you can easily make this set from spare parts. A great support vehicle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"zinkk757","2008-01-12T21:13:32.747Z","4/5 could be cooler","  This set is small and part of a bonus pack so it was suposed to be simple.  The vehicle is really cool with articulation and some satelite equiptment in the back.  The only complaint i have with this set is that the 2 x 2 45 degree slope on the front should have the m-tron logo.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>This was alright in my book, a M-Tron Minifigure, flat computer piece and some wheels and a hinged piece that's not often seen in Lego when building vehicles. Fairly decent for it's size and to give a taste of the Larger M-Tron them and coloring.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
