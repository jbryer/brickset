But it's still a GREAT little vehicle, with enough nifty parts (at the time) to make great cars of your own.

"oldfan","2013-07-25T17:15:09.89Z","Just your basic Town filler","My brother received this set when it first came out, and I received the 6363 Auto Repair Shop at the same time. &nbsp;These were our first Town sets, and we tried to make a LEGO ""town"" together using just two vehicles, one building, and lots of imagination. &nbsp;Given my fond memories of these two sets, I think we succeeded!<div><br></div><div>Town System sets were much more varied and plentiful in the early '80's compared to today. &nbsp;While there were always 2-3 large sets, the vast majority of Town sets were small vehicles with one mini-figure and maybe an accessory. &nbsp;And there were a lot of them, sometimes 15-20 available at any given time. &nbsp;6648 Dump Truck is one of those small filler sets (even though this might be one of the largest vehicles of the time), intended to provide variety to your town at a decent price, and look good while doing so. &nbsp;Here are my impressions of the set (I still have it today, along with all my brother's former sets...):</div><div><br></div><div>-The build is very similar to the tow truck in 6363; most of this era's trucks followed the same basic construction. &nbsp;And no shortcut pieces; the entire vehicle is plate- and brick-built. &nbsp;Only the windshield, ""roll bar"", transparent light pieces, wheels, doors, hinge, and the obvious ""tipper bed"" piece are specialty parts. &nbsp;Everything is solid and holds together well.</div><div><br></div><div>-The vehicles of this era had no roof, in order to be able to facilitate placement and removal of the mini-fig in and out of the cab (remember, this is before the hinge roof pieces appeared). &nbsp;While I'm sure most dump trucks are not convertibles with racing-inspired roll bars in real life, a child's imagination will not care, as long as he/she can play with the truck and driver as desired. &nbsp;Besides, this is one of the few black ""roll bar"" pieces in my inventory!</div><div><br></div><div>-The ""tipper bed"" piece would have been difficult to brick-build to this scale with the part selection of the time. &nbsp;Today, with the larger 6-wide City vehicles that are double the size of 6648, maybe this would be easier. &nbsp;6648 is one instance where the big hunk of plastic really works well for the toy in question. &nbsp;The old standby 2x8/2x4 hinge piece is a solid construction that still has plenty of friction to hold position of the tipper bed after all these years.</div><div><br></div><div>-The mini-figure has no printing on the blue torso, has the standard grin head, and wears the requisite red hard-hat. &nbsp;You'll never find a more uncomplicated figure in today's sets! &nbsp;One of the ""construction vests"" available at the time would have been nice for the driver, but I guess all he has to do is drive (and never needs to leave the cab...).</div><div><br></div><div>-There are no accessories or other construction-zone items such as barricades. &nbsp;There is no place to put them on a dump truck, and since you should use 6648 alongside 5-10 other similar-sized sets in your Town's workzone, you should not need them!</div><div><br></div><div>-While there are alternative builds on the box, with such an obvious piece there are not too many things you can do with the parts. &nbsp;You can make a slightly different-looking dump truck, and that's it...</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, 6648 is a nice addition to any Classic Town setup, ubiquitous in any construction zone and adding the right ambiance to your display.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
