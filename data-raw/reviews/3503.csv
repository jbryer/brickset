Obviously I can't review this without being a bit biased because of all the wonderful memories I have of this set, but I'll do my best just to give the details.
OK, lets start with the looks. It has the same red/ yellow colour scheme as the older street sweeper, but instead of a one brick deep red line, there is a red line the depth of a plate piece.
There are four old light grey tap pieces on the back to pick up dirt and dust in your town, and the large sweeper at the front, as well as suckers at either side. 

The minifig sits in a small cab at the front, which has a big semi- rare windshield at the front. He wears a blue boiler suit and a red cap, but the torso piece is useful because on its own, it can be a casual jacket which looks great with sand coloured legs.
He also has some tools which is always nice, a black shovel and a broom.

One thing that stands out to me though is the alternate models on the back of the box, especially the drag car style one, which I remember building when I was three (Its one of my earliest memories!) so if you can find a copy on eBay, get it boxed.

Well that's pretty much it, I think its great because it was my first set, but to anyone else, its a nice- looking street sweeper for your town that no-one can afford to miss out on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-21T11:38:08.767Z","LEGO Town (Maintenance) - Street Sweeper Review","<p>This is a nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 10 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 63 pieces and it was 6.75 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig has a blue overall, a red cap and black shades on the face. It's a really cool looking figure for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6649-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This vehicle may doesn't do much but it's still a very cool looking street sweeper. The cockpit can be opened very easily and the big yellow piece which has the two blue pieces in it can sviwel. On one side we also get a vacuum cleaner and a broom. On the other side we get a shovel. It's a really good little set to add into any LEGO city for sure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box and short instructions, harder than nowadays one but you&#39;ll find little no challenge building this up.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some cool/uncommon parts in it such the front sweeper, the 2 glasses, the 2 tools and the &quot;lights&quot; bricks. I find the parts assortments really good for that price tag.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The cool early &#39;90 man: Sunglasses, fierce expression, working suit and a red cap. You may think it&#39;s pretty straight but it&#39;s one of my favurite one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are not any transcendental building steps here.</p>

<h3>The completed model / Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I found this set simply Magnificent; back in the days it was much more realistic and detailed&nbsp;than the vast majority of other vehicles sets while nowadays i found it still rightful to stand in a modern Lego City environment. It&#39;s, in my own opinion, a real masterpiece of &#39;90 Lego&#39;s design. Must have.</p>
