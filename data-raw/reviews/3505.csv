"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T21:35:47Z","A treasured set","I received this set for Christmas 1982 and can still  remember it vividly.  Released at the same time as the first ever Post Office set, this van was of a much better design than the uncovered van which came with the Post Office.  The newly designed 4x1 wall pieces ensured there was plenty of space in the back for letter boxes and letters while the smart yellow and red colour scheme ensured it stood out in traffic.

"claherre","2008-12-27T19:31:37.797Z","A must have!","This set is the perfect companion to set 6362 (Post Office). The van looks more realistic than the pickup of the other set.

Sets like this are always my favorite. They provide the &quot;services&quot; that a real town needs, outside of the multitude of cops, firefighters and racers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"syslam","2009-07-22T10:23:46.653Z","mail van with good capacity","This van has a very good design, and most importantly it holds much more goods than the most recent mail van and even more than the mail plane. It's color scheme and look are compatible with the city series. 
Just 3 letters not enough, add 2 to 3 more parcels and 2 more letters will be better.....a bit greedy.

If the head part of the van adds a radiator and the wheels are changed with the modern ones, it will  be better than the current van.

"grobrick","2013-08-11T16:59:38.03Z","Nice additional to 6362","Since the post office 6362 has only one Postman and one truck, this is a good opportunity to enlarge your post network.<br>Good point: the sticker are well placed. They are on a single special 3x3 brick.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"T79","2014-08-29T14:17:17.36Z","Which way to the post office?","<p>Another one of those old, small vans to review. They were cheap enough to be affordable by a kid with pocket money and you could never have enough of them. This Mail Truck&nbsp;is similar to #6624 Delivery Van which I reviewed earlier.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Again, I lost them all. Online scans at Peeron helped me out, again. Just as with #6624, all&#39;s&nbsp;done in ten steps even though this mail truck has a slightly higher piece count, but then filling up the mailbox does not require a lot of steps anyway.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Also remarkably similar to #6624: two large 1 x 4 x 3 panels with a postal service logo stickered on (still in good condition), doors, wheels, plates, steering wheel, windscreen, hinged roof... The biggest differences are the inclusion of another 4 x 5 car base, a 1 x 4 x 3 window (one of our only yellow ones) and two matching shutters (our only yellow ones) and of course a mailbox with three letters. A part which in my opinion is missing, however, is a grill for the radiator.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One postal service employee. The only difference from the delivery guy&nbsp;in #6624 is the red torso which is nicely printed with a jacket and the postal service logo.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Similar to #6624, as is to be expected. However, despite having almost the same piece count (if you discount the mailbox and letters) this mail truck is 25% longer! Of course, at the scale we are working in this means a full<em> two </em>studs longer, but still: the difference when both are placed side by side is <em>huge, </em>#6624 looks tiny even compared to this small truck. This also means it can carry a lot of cargo for its size, loading even the entire mailbox is a piece of cake. Although you&#39;ll have to wriggle it in a bit, the window with shutters leaves a slightly narrower entry compared to the hinged roof used in #6624.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This truck seems to be a lot better than the one included in #6362 Post Office, and it seems they fixed the only gripe I had with #6624: they included some cargo (letters) and even a mailbox to pick them up from! Of course, since nothing is perfect in this world, they forgot something else: a grill on the front and some rear lights. Such a small thing but it would have made a big difference, the weird&nbsp;thing is that they&nbsp;would have been so easy to add&nbsp;one must wonder if they were left out deliberately, did those extra bits cost too much? Even with&nbsp;e.g. one&nbsp;letter less?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you have #6362, use this truck in place of the tiny open truck provided there. Another oldie well received by the next generation!</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T21:01:34.257Z","Nice addition, but nothing new","<p>This design follows the livery of the other postal-related sets, and as such is bold and striking. The build of the van, however, is nothing new, so anyone looking for an innovative building experience will be disappointed. The same structure of a front cab, panel sides, and rear door shutters can be found on several other Legoland Town vehicles, so if you like more of the same you&#39;ll be happy with this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moulded postbox with the postal service logo is the novelty here, and its functionality feels realistic enough - there&#39;s room for several letters to be posted through the slot before it needs to be emptied. The minifigure&#39;s post service uniform is distinct and smart. The set compliments the set 6362 Post Office well, offering a different vehicle alongside that set&#39;s smaller truck.</p>
