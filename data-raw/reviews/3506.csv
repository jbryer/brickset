the set seems to be a direct predecessor to set 6532, which came out 8 years later and looks quite similar, a bit less sturdy perhaps. the focus here concentrates on playability rather than on a sleek design, you can't lose the trailer, and the tipper is safely attached.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotowner","2011-03-05T23:24:44.763Z","I was too rough","I was too young too when I got this set, one my first I couldnt even build it, it was too hard at that age. When I was ready to make it I had already snapped the black piece that made the tipper worker and the bucket itself had a large crack. I was pretty dissapointed as this set would have served a great purpose and been a good worker.",FALSE,4,3,3,4,4
"T79","2014-07-04T13:44:51.273Z","Big (relatively) Monster","<p>Another set I remember having since I was very young. Also another set I have practically never rebuilt as I had lost the instructions before I could really build something myself. Are we noticing a pattern here?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The main part here of course is the bucket itself, which for small hands is satisfyingly big. Other interesting parts are the two different&nbsp;hinges: one for connecting the cab with the trailer and the other for lifting the bucket, for a long time these were my only ones of these&nbsp;(at least in black), the bucket is still unique in my collection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One worker in hard hat and the&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;blue shirt with white pocket print, again generic enough to be used in whatever&nbsp;role required. Together with the worker from #6302 and the garage owner from #361 (with the addition of a hard hat)&nbsp;this one&nbsp;formed my&nbsp;construction crew for a long time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nice and short, I like the alternating black and yellow lines on the cab front but it all&nbsp;really is just a big bucket on big hinges on big wheels (relatively speaking, back then they were big... and it still is a small model).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>On the same scale #6624 and this one seem to be opposites: both have ~40 pieces but while #6624 is small and cute this one is a big, lumbering beast nearly double the size. Again, just as with #6624, something to actually dump&nbsp;would have been nice too but this can be found easily enough. :-)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Forget what I said with my review of #6624, quantity has a quality all of its own! My children love both but this one gets to do the heavy work: negating crater plates and hauling big loads (singing the&nbsp;title&nbsp;song of &#39;Bob the Builder&#39; is entirely optional).</p>
