"ratz","2008-02-27T04:04:49.92Z","how could you ever...","... give one of those classics a bad rating? impossible, there's way too much nostalgia involved. anyway, with this set you get the nice autobahn-decorated panels, and if you're lucky there is still the chevron-sticker on the front bricks. 
i really appreciate that lego this year returned to the tradition to make small, cheap cars, e.g. the new 7731 postal car - thats how you make sets that will be remembered!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-02-27T22:12:02.217Z","Keeping the Highway Safe","I think this is a great set overall, and there are reasons why. First, I like the rugged wheels and the fact that it is a four wide minifig scale car. Second, there are alot of supplies in this set like a wrench and some signs. Finally, this set is flawless in every way possible, and I don't say that to every set. I give this set the usual 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Sitting atop very chunky tyres with red hubcaps, white plates layer twice on to a black base plate and hold a strong frame for the blue bricks.&nbsp;These include two panels and a hinged frame for holding the roof plate and its yellow lights. Blue doors build in as usual along with the front bricks and the yellow headlights.</div><div><br></div><div>Hold it. At first simple, it then appears you get stickers to apply to those panels and the front bricks yes, the one stud wide bricks. Good luck, the front ones are fiddly as satan's violin but will look excellent if placed well with their white diagonal stripes. The rear panel stickers are apparently 'Autobahn' stickers and very popular. Apply these and it brings the character to life in the van.</div><div><br></div><div>An open back is unusual but perfectly suitable for slinging things in to during bad weather. Here the kit involves two white cylindrical cones with red lights, a blue directional arrow symbol tile sign and a red triangle tile sign. All this can be chucked in the back and used all over town roads and highways.</div><div><br></div><div>Just to warn, as typically inferior some alternative builds are on the instructions, these ones are also bizarre.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cone Display</b></div><div>An early and solidly pleasing maintenance vehicle.
