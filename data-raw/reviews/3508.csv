"ratz","2005-06-03T03:31:47Z","ok","despite its from 1983 this set looks very &quot;basic&quot; in the lego-sense, due not only to the blue-red colour combination. the car is not very elegant, and the whole set seems to be a predecessor to set 6644. at least you have the quite rare grey motorbike.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It is long gone over the past 25 years, but I will always remember it.  It was the &quot;ONE&quot; gift I was allowed to open early, on Christmas Eve morning before the family arrived for dinner.  It was from my mom's best friend, Jeanie.  Strange what you remember after that many years have passed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is a little plain, but I loved this set when I was a kid, and it fits the simple style of the town sets at the time.  The motorcycle was the coolest things about it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-25T05:49:08.967Z","The First Dirt Biker","The one piece motorbike chassis appeared in 1983 in a couple of sets including the Police and as a road transport but here it is for off road fun.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路][</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><div>He looks the part but that pristine white top is ready to get covered in mud.</div><div><br><div><b>Dirt Biking Made Clean &amp; Smart</b></div><div>This simple grey motorbike gets no lights unfortunately which is a shame but then they are not necessary for some daytime off-roading. A badge or bodywork is instead applied in the form of &nbsp;a yellow tile. The trailer that carries the bike which connects to a central offset stud plate, is quite grand for such a small purpose. In smart red plates and blue triangular bricks (top pieces for some roofs) it even has a fold-up rear ramp that remains split in its two halves and devoid of rear lights. The addition of a four stud plate and some brake lights would have raised this excellent early vehicle set up a notch in my opinion.</div></div><div><br></div><div>At least it looks smart and the cab, like a tiny Bedford Rascal pick up, is great with its red plates and blue aligned with the trailer. The red cab roof very suitably tops it off and the old red hubcap wheels just do the job nicely. Again no rear lights and nothing to go in the back, the helmet could have on a post? Better than nothing.</div><div><br></div><div>Unbelievably the alternative builds are really quite good, you get an open top pick up, a tractor and trailer and a snowplow.</div><div><br></div><div>While very mildly lacking this early endeavour within the Vehicles subtheme is a fond memory and always good in a Town landscape.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"AETerry","2011-02-07T18:15:57.45Z","Motorcycle Transport Review","<p>This set is one of three featuring a vehicle and motorcycle. The other two are 6677 Motocross Racing and 6644 Road Rebel. It also carries a lot of fond memories for me of a summer going up to Canada to visit my Grandpa and him getting it for me from a toy store there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to 6677 and 6644, this set does seem rather blocky and primative in design compared to later vehicles that pull off more sleek and realistic designs. It's a basic red and blue coloring for the truck and trailer. You get a grey motorcycle. Not too fancy when you've got several others to pick from. But being the first, it deserves a place in Lego Town as a Classic.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
