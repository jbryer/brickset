"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-12T20:04:48Z","First of it's kind","1984 marked the introduction of the detachable wheels, and this feature was never better illustrated than with 6655.  The car itself was of standard early to mid 80's design, but the detachable wheels together with the newly designed and very cute functional car jack made this set a must have of the time. The wheel balancing machine (I presume) and the spanner were nice finishing touches.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2005-06-01T08:01:06Z","quite good","now the only thing the car misses is a driver who waits for his car being repaired by the mechanic. everything else is fine, and the car is quite big compared to pickups from the same era... but nothing about scale here.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2008-01-12T01:55:20.06Z","Nice wheels, man!","This was another set that I was able to purchase myself.  I remember buying it on a family trip many years ago.  The car is pretty standard, but with much better looking wheels than the old red-hub design.  The fact that they can be detached is perfect for the mechanic, and the functional floor jack that can actually hold the car up (just as shown on the box) is brilliant!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-11-22T04:41:15.913Z","Hit The Road Jack","The Minifigure car evolved to a standard design in the 1980's; four studs wide, eight long with a standard 'chassis' brick,&nbsp;a hinged opening top, single seat and a pair of two brick high windscreens. This cornered, small, and chunky box on wheels endured through out subthemes to much variation, enhancement and customisation.<div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>The mechanic gets some early blue dungarees and comes with a useful spanner and jack.</li></ul></div></div><div><b>Four Stud Car</b></div><div>Its popularity seems obvious due to its long and repeated use before the six stud wide designs appeared. The car is diminutive enough to make minifigures appear chunky and cumbersome yet has wheels that seem almost to scale if it were not for the sheer width of such drivers.</div><div><br></div><div>This smart red car is almost typical of a standard vehicle but for the extra feature of an opening bonnet. The black top and yellow seat complement just fine and the removable wheels and axle bricks mean that the mechanic character can replace wheels and tyres and so on.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The lego jack is the interesting and clever piece in this set and was in a few mechanic theme sets for added interaction. The jack works well and could hold up more than just a car, though testing this too far would snap the sacred tool forever, even if there is a glue that works on Lego, it always warps and bends before snapping, usually ruining it forevermore.</div><div><br></div><div>The mechanic also gets a diagnostic box of some sort or PSI reader perhaps that inflates tyres? It takes the car wheels on the side and seems to round off his tool collection nicely for the theme of the set and fixing anyone's car. Lets not forget the familiar blue dungarees, a must for any mechanic and in this set a smart blue cap.</div><div><br></div><div>These car designs never seem to get boring in building but too many similar vehicles could reduce some appeal. More vehicles than buildings in a layout can feel a little bare and unbalanced and there are many, possibly far too many vehicles out there, but thats what we like as kids and big kids: interactive transport and movement that looks fun.</div><div><br></div><div>A final word on these vehicles is the customisation possibilities. Stretching them in to multiple people carriers has got to be an often tried and tested build, along with colour schemes such as stripes, half and half and chequers. Even with the six stud wide vehicles, it remains a frustration and an obsessive challenge to make cars that can take four mini figures in formation, with doors shut, a roof on top and still appear in minifigure 'scale'.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Brick In Your Bonnet</b></div><div>This set is a great example of your basic Lego minifigure car and a good one to collect for the addition of a mechanic in the collection. However you may prefer a more specialised car design in which case there are plenty out there including a few brilliant Creator sets that occaisionally adapt for minifigures to hit the road, with or without the wonderful jack.</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"iwybs","2018-09-27T05:41:12.703Z","A splendid little car","<p>I never liked the Town cars from my childhood.&nbsp; Their steeply sloped hoods didn&#39;t look right, they had no proper seats inside, and they were usually mounted on ridiculously large tires.&nbsp; Even worse, they usually had no roof or rear windshield.&nbsp; In contrast, this car has everything I wanted: realistic, though abstracted, proportions in the front and rear decks; small wheels that fit within the wheel arches; nice big headlights and tail lights; an opening hood; front and rear windshields and a roof; and a real chair for the driver.&nbsp; Even better, it comes with a jack and a spanner in this set.&nbsp; Too bad this set was before my time; I didn&#39;t get it until a few months ago.&nbsp; Because the parts are common and simple, it can often be found online for less than the price of a City starter pack or Great Vehicle today, or you can Bricklink&nbsp;it or assemble it from spare parts for an equally low price.&nbsp; Either way, this little car definitely deserves a place on the streets of your Lego city.</p>

"Brandon","2016-06-27T00:05:22.377Z","Changing a tire","<p>It is a good small set. It has a pretty nice car that comes with it, you can open and close the hood and the doors. The wheels on the set I don&#39;t like though, it doesn&#39;t look as good compared with the red stud tires that are on older Lego&nbsp;automobiles. It does come with a jack lift though which are pretty neat.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box is fine and the instruction manual has groovy alternate builds on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: Not to many parts, but does come with groovy jack lift pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: Comes with 1 simple mechanic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: It was a basic build, nothing was hard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: It was good, it fit into my Lego town.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: 6655 was a nice small set, but I think Lego could have done something about the wheels.</p>
