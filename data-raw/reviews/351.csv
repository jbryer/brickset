The ship has detail but no playability other than it's a spaceship and has two levers. No cockpit window, no decent details (great for parts and figures though). The thing that saves this set is probably the design. It is a good transport vehicle, but would be best off as part of another, larger set, since on its own, it isn't worth the high average price. If you really want one, buy the parts.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-21T22:09:55.343Z","would ya scoot over a bit? you're cramping our blacktron style!","I have no idea why lego put two minifigs on one tiny set. The craft itself is decent and has nice wings and weapons, but if they were going for a ""gemini twin"" idea, it failed. It makes it look all smushed up and cramped.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2012-05-03T07:45:36.003Z","A fair model","<p>A small set which nevertheless has some interesting pieces.&nbsp; It's a nice shape and I'm sure it has good playability value, although surely in any battle the pilots would be sitting ducks as they are far too open and exposed.</p>
<p>Overall it's a fair attempt to do something different.&nbsp; There are two of those inferior ""Blacktron 2"" spacemen in mostly-white uniforms with silly knitted-sweater 'B's on them, but it is nice to see a two-man spacecraft which actually comes with two men.</p>

"natro220","2010-04-18T20:22:57.437Z","Could have been worse...","I never expected much from the value packaged sets around this time. &nbsp;The fact that this one comes with two minifigs actually puts it above most of the value pack sets already. &nbsp;It's good to get a couple more Blacktron guys to cause havoc on your Mtron or Futuron bases if you wish. &nbsp;Unless you are a hardcore space collector, I wouldn't bother tracking this set down if you don't already have it. &nbsp;The build is nothing special (I never cared for the space sets that had no windscreen protection)...just good to build your Blacktron army.",FALSE,4,3,3,3,4
"samuraiturtle","2009-11-04T03:23:26.047Z","A Forgetable Set","I am not too impress with this set it just does not have much going for it.  The only good things going for it are: two astronaut for a little set, a big octagon plate (I am guessing that is for some boat set), and maybe the two levers/""control sticks"" hinges.

"AETerry","2010-10-19T20:41:34.323Z","Blacktron Pilot Craft","<p>I liked the series 1 Blacktron minifigs and coloring better... solid black visors for the helmets and solid black minifig with printed front for the suit. Not to mention the solid black with yellow highlights of the vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set comes as part of a value pack, to give buyers/collecters a taste of the different Legoland themes available at the time. It's okay, it just largely feels uninspired by Lego.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
