<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provided me with countless joy and months of fun. There's a pair of hinges that made the crane to lower down. Best matched with other LEGO town cars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts are minimal enough but I remembered I used to build a Transformer Insecticon Shrapnel with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too bad the grey hose-like parts doesn't connect well to the bricks/plates and I falls out often.</p>

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-12T03:18:24.97Z","Four Stud Rescue & Repair","I hope there is a BrickList out there that shows every 'mechanic' set up to date. Mechanics, whether they work in a garage or drive a tow truck seem an essential for Town and City themes that have traffic all over the place. The subtheme 'Maintenance' is generally hard to exhaust.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>A common feature of mechanic MFs is blue fatigues or dungarees. He is replete with a spanner and umm...hammer?&nbsp;I suppose you have to break up car wrecks a bit for towing. His shiny black bonce is the hair stuff of 1980's male MF bowlcut trendiness (MF barbers ideally use a mould rather than scissors).&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><b>Breakdown Cover</b></div><div>His tools fit neatly in to those interactive bricks, the six stud rails and four stud bars, in this case a suitable grey metal. The blue truck appears low but four stud capable in its towing capacity and has small but special hub capped wheels -those were a welcome design when new.</div><div><br></div><div>Grey chassis complements the blue body work really well and the box design is typical but totally suitable with a very nice grey seat. The roof is hinged naturally with the simple but smashing fat little light brick atop in its transparent yellow.</div><div><br></div><div>A good graphic or art designer knows to contrast and complement. The towing brick is a well suited example of this in red but yellow would have been equally complementary. This chunky piece has a lovely grey hook on it and is upon a special hinge brick to let it down low to hook-up and tow. This scores well for action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Towed Home</b></div><div>The overall build is a nice break from four stud cars and actually rather good although this remains a basic model compared to many larger sets. The MF man turned out to be an important character in our games for no particular reason. Sometimes a set will stretch to blend with others, make new things and reform.&nbsp;Definitely a keeper.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"sf1378","2012-09-19T00:09:27.927Z","Another great item","Can't say more on this than others have but I think it goes great with the Auto Workshop 6369 - 1 set along with the 6610 Shell Petrol Pumps. Together, you have a lovely trio forming a small, independent Mechanics with Petrol from Shell. Another set I dearly wanted as a kid but Mum and Dad didn't buy (food and bills were a priority really) but eventually bought in 2007 when I came out of my 'Dark Ages'...The Mechanic in my sets called 'Silas'.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,3,5,5
"James83","2012-07-13T07:03:39.427Z","A Handy Little Tow Truck","<p>This is one of the first sets I remember owning and certainly kept busy towing all those cars that broke&nbsp;down or crashed!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This was one of the classic style vehicles of the era but was very well designed. The cab has a proper grey seat, the hook unit can be lowered. It even looks quite good with those side bars and low rear section. The roll-bar behind the cab could double as a barrier too.&nbsp;The few downsides were the lack of a proper grill, a black 2x1 brick was a cheap option (later I replaced mine with a grill brick) and the fact that the hook didn't really hold onto its towed vehicle unless you were travelling slow and in a straight line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>A basic mechanic figure with overalls, without the commonplace cap that came&nbsp;on later sets,&nbsp;but a welcome addition to any town.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>When other later Tow Trucks came along mine was relegated from its towing duties. It became a flatbed truck and could be covered in with a couple of side panels to make a van. It was a versatile commerical vehicle that could fulfill any&nbsp;role.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p><p>A nice little set that offers a good amount of playability and it looks good too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
