Bulldozers have a large bade/plow on the front for pushing dirt, not lifting it!  Because of the name snafu, I am forced to give this set a 9 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

As a front-end loader the set is perfect.  It replicates the real thing without the need for specialized pieces as would be found in a modern Lego city set.  As always, more standard pieces increases the potential for creativity in building other projects.  I like the use of slanted bricks, the articulated design and the large, realistic bucket.  No wonder the minifig is smiling; he's got the best construction vehicle in LEGOLAND.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The rugged wheels are pretty cool and the scooper is the best part of this set. There are no excuses for this set and it is a Lego Legend.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
