It's a simple little design in the old standard of 4 pegs wide and the flip top to seat the mini figure (it also has doors for the purists out there). This is a classic Lego set with 2 mini figures, a camera, a boom seat and a film reel tile. Can't go wrong here if you can find it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The camera crew (and later add-ons like the camera van) made movies of my adventures with the Castle, Pirates and Space sets. So my entire LEGO collection (not having too many City sets) was in fact one big movie studio (years before the Studios were released).

I even played Star Wars using Space sets lightyears before the first licensed LEGO Star Wars set was ever released.

Ah, Camera Crew, how fond the memories of adventures and movies past... :-)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My father bought this set for me when i was about 2 years old, and he put it together for me. The interesting thing is, that this is the ONLY set i ever had, that to this day have never been taken apart. And it never will be. 

Granted, i'm not a big collector or anything (yet), but still i think it's a funny story.

Excellent piece of Lego, in the classic design, high quality, endless possibilities, and should really be a part of every Lego town.

Top 5/5 from me, mostly from nostalgic reasons, but still it's a great set.

Best Regards.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
