viewable engine, only technic sets have viewable engines, but not this one

unique hook brick, you don't really see that piece around anymore

cool minifig, a real wrecker driver.

this set may seem simple, but is loads of fun to play with, especially on uneven surfaces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-23T11:01:55.793Z","No hinges to lower the hook","The wheels with suspension are excellent! You don't find them in many sets. The red tile on the motor can be lifted since it is fixed with a hinge brick. So you can have a look at the car's motor. But there is no mechanism with which you can lower the hook to tow vehicles, which is a pity. Anyway, it's a great truck!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The crane in the back is pretty cool too. The minifig is also a good addition to this set. The suspension is really good in this set and it deserves a 5 because of that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main draw where the suspensions for the wheels. Take the hook off and you could design an awesome off road truck spinning through mud with it. The other was the minifigure having a very compelling and fun design on his shirt that spoke of a young person out having fun and not some suit or uniform deal and must be all serious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is solid for it's day and age and very fun to get.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
