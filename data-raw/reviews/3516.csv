"T79","2014-07-09T15:13:19.963Z","Best backhoe I had!","<p>Well, it was also the <em>only</em> backhoe I had. This was one of the last sets I received before my interest in lego waned so I don&#39;t have a lot of memories of playing with this set. I did remember I had it though, and with the children&#39;s interest in everything construction-related&nbsp;in mind I&nbsp;decided to rebuild this one.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>At least I still had the instructions, finally a set I found the instructions of! A sheet which guides you through the uncomplicated construction in 13 steps, of which the last one is just adding the road signs and tools, basically. Did anyone know what to do with those points that could be found in a corner of the instructions from that era? I have found several coupons like this but never found any information included on what to do with these points&nbsp;so they all remained nicely attached to the instructions...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Where to begin? Two excavator buckets, two minifig tools, two printed road signs, a straight windscreen, big wheels, the only yellow hinged roof with sunroof in my possession, small turntables and hinges... try and find something in here you can&#39;t use!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just one, and that is all that is needed here: the ever present coverall and hard hat (though I never had enough hard hats). He comes with a broom and shovel, and two signs to mark the spot where he&#39;s doing his digging.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s just ~80 pieces, so don&#39;t expect anything mindblowing. But it&#39;s nice to build anyway, the way the small digger is connected so it can rotate is still clever, the wheels are suitably big and the cabin sufficiently roomy, though controls&nbsp;for the digger at the back seem to be lacking.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Everything you need to dig your way around is right here in this set. I never had another one but now being able to compare with images from for example&nbsp;#6686 it is clear what a tremendous leap forward this one is over its older counterpart. It looks suitably impressive for being only four studs wide and is overall very functional.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Another favourite of my children now, though they are fascinated with construction equipment so it&#39;s hardly a fair race :)</p>

<p>A very good-looking and playable construction machine, sold! And for less then &euro;5 on Bricklink you can have (another) one!</p>

It was a gift to my son when he was about 7 years old. It is still one of the simplest sets but full of beautiful details.</p>
