"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T06:10:36.17Z","Ready to Stir Up Some Trouble…","I managed to get this set online for a great price, and there is very little to fault it.   The jeep cabriolet is attractive and wouldn’t look out of place at the local marina or at the beach!   The Octan colour scheme runs through the entire set from the jeep to the pocket rocket boat.   The jeep comes complete with long range aerial which doubles as a helmet holder!   Why Lego didn’t add a bracket on to the roll bar to accommodate the helmet is beyond me, my set has this modification.   The trailer, like the Wave Master set (6596) is utilitarian in its grey appearance and style and serves its purpose well, again there is no provision of a hauling winch but a minor niggle.   The boat is colourful, clean and unfussy.   The small cockpit seats just one minifig with a headrest and Octan colour-themed outboard motor which, unusually does not pivot on a bracket.   Let’s hope shallow water isn’t encountered!

This is a great little set which is attractive and pleasing to build, I could really imagine the skipper stirring up the waves, and some trouble, in this boat.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minifig:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minifig has an Octan shirt, green pants, regular smile face, red hat/helment, and yellow realistic life jacket.&nbsp;Helmant has black visor.&nbsp;The minifig gets a 5/5!</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeep:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jeep has red mudgards, transparant light blue windshild, white roll bar, black antena for life jacket and helment, Octan sticker, and the Jeep is jacked up.&nbsp;The Jeep gets&nbsp;5/5!</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tailer:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trailer has a basic design, not much to it. On one part the studs are raised up to keep the (drag (racing) boat sliding off. The trailer should have&nbsp;brack lights on the back. Not con.&nbsp;The trailer gets a 3/5!</p>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag Racing Boat:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The (drag (racing) boat has two Octan stickers, cool engine, and cool looks. Tis is the only thing I have for cons. The back end sinks in to the water and tips over. ): The whole reason of buying this set&nbsp;this that it has a boat that should float! I was very disapointed! The boat gets a 1/5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I you want a boat that floats, don't buy this set. BOAT DON'T FLOAT!</p>
<p>&nbsp;): :( p.s the value for money is 5/5 because the ebay seller under priced it. :)</p>",TRUE,2,5,5,2,5

","I had this set when I was a kid and loved it, but I don’t think I ever really knew that this set was called “Wave Rebel”, and I have rarely heard anything more incongruous in my life, at least as far as LEGO is concerned. Considering that this guy is openly taking sponsorship from the Octan megacorporation, I don’t think he’s really rebelling against much of anything.<br><br>But what does that matter, right? This pleasant little set comes with a standard Octan Minifig and a number of interactive components that make this set a classic. A sweet jeep, a sweet boat, and a sweet trailer on which to rest the boat all come out of this set’s 79 pieces, and it’s hard to get much better than that.<br><br>Our Octan-sponsored friend here is well-accessorised, which is a boon that I feel that contemporary City Minifigs are lacking. When on the high seas, the Minifig can swap his cap for a crash helmet and throw on a life vest to make his ocean-going sojourn safer. The black antenna-type piece is a perfect place to store these accessories when he’s on the move, so you don’t have to worry about bits and bobs getting lost in your carpet.<br><br>None of the three vehicles are particularly complicated, but they all look nice and serve their purpose well. In particular, the boat fits very snugly on its trailer without being difficult to remove, and, in spite of appearances, the trailer is actually pretty sturdy. The one downside is that the boat, unfortunately, does not float, which is a bit of a shame, but I suppose there’s not much that one can do about that save for using specialised pieces, which would definitely ruin the modularity of a small set like this one.<br><br>Wave Rebel has aged well since its debut in 1993, and it will definitely still look good in contemporary marina displays. With the exception of the sticker pieces, I imagine that this set would be pretty easy to recreate from spare parts, or you could hunt around and see if anyone is still selling it. It’s a classic that’s worth having. <br>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
