"piratetown","2007-08-02T11:08:01.927Z","Too many choppers and motorbikes","I had this set and the headquarters of that year, which I think was a bit overkill. This set is useful to boost police numbers if that's what you want, but since I already had the bigger police chopper and two motorbikes from the headquarters and the surveillance team, this set was rather redundant. More leathers, more helmets, not very useful for using on other things.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"emzex","2009-07-20T17:15:52.763Z","Nice little set for an impulse buy","Just got this set (a little) used, and so far I really like it. You get two policemen with two vehicles, including the good old classic motorbike. The design is pretty basic, typical 90's town cops.

For a small no-nonsense police set, the only cons i see are that TLG could have added some rare pieces in, and there's not too much creative freedom with this amount of parts. As said before, makes most sense as an additional unit in a larger force. 

Still, I give it a solid 4! You can't beat the price, these guys can be had for about $4 now!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-08T10:28:09.17Z","LEGO Town (Police) - Chopper Cops Review","<p>This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it. However, this instruction doesn't really look like it's going to have two pages if you see it for the first time. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 67 pieces and it's a really good value. The set was 7.25 USD when it was on sale which means that this set has a price per piece ratio of 10.821 cents per piece.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set includes two cops: Both of them look the same with the black overalls and the black shades on the face - except for the helmet. One of the figures has a police sign printed on the helmet. The other one doesn't have this.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers with this set.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6664-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set comes with a motorbike and a very cool looking helicopter. The motorbike has a really good design. However, I like the new motorbike designs from the LEGO City theme much better than this one. The helicopter has blades on the top and on the back which sviwel full 360Â° and the cockpit can be opened very easily as well.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"brixton","2009-09-03T19:47:06.607Z","Grounded","My favorite part of this set is the motorcycle.  It was fun playing with it growing up.  The helicopter itself though was flimsy and not as enjoyable to play with.  I remember pieces always falling off when I tried playing with it which wasn't the case with my other lego sets.  The rotors and landing gear were the main culprits.  The strength of this set is pairing the bike and helicopter together even if they could have made the chopper better.  I like the old style cop uniforms better than the new ones that lego has released.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"T79","2014-09-09T14:49:02.48Z","Mo' choppa's? Mo' bikes!","<p>This was the last police set I remember we got, at this time I wasn&#39;t so much into lego anymore so the two&nbsp;I&nbsp;have here in front of me probably belonged to my brothers. It seems similar to a #6354 Pursuit Squad &quot;light&quot; as it includes a motorcycle and helicopter while dropping the 4x4 with trailer and speedboat.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A rather large sheet with about 15 steps in total here. Strictly speaking, the sheet is larger than necessary as the separate steps have a lot of breathing space but I&#39;m not complaining. It&#39;s striking how ten years earlier sheets were smaller and still included alternative ideas too, though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Speaking of alternative ideas, everything you need to adorn the motorcycle and build a helicopter is here but building something else (i.e. nice)&nbsp;with just this set would be rather difficult. The best parts are probably the motorcycle itself -&nbsp;even in white you could always use it as a civilian motorcycle -&nbsp;and the printed &#39;police&#39; tiles with red line. The printing is different from the earlier &#39;police&#39; tiles and it probably stayed that way for a while but these are the only ones in this style we have. There is even one helm which has the same printing, why only one and not both is anyone&#39;s guess.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two cops in a new uniform here, I never liked them as much as the older ones as it just seems to be&nbsp;too cartoony, what&nbsp;with the severely oversized zipper and badge. They both have a new helmet with visor though,&nbsp;one of them is even printed which was a first for us at that time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Another of these ubiquitous small helicopters, how many can they squeeze out? We must have had at least five of these if you only count the police helicopters, the mind boggles if you try to include the fire- stunt- airport- etc. helicopters as well. It&#39;s like every other&nbsp;small&nbsp;helicopter you&#39;ve had up to this point but even more basic (yes, it <em>is</em> possible). If this were your first helicopter build you might give it a better score but&nbsp;even so, I cannot find any improvement over the older ones we had so I&#39;m leaving it at &#39;one&#39;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While there have been several police helicopters before this one&nbsp;they always seemed to have at least some unique feature to them, be it the side panels with window pane&nbsp;making&nbsp;#6642 Police Helicopter look&nbsp;bigger or&nbsp;the searchlights and&nbsp;recording equipment&nbsp;on the helicopter from #6354, but this one is as bare-bones as possible, two lights on either side of the cockpit and a tile with grille covering the two unused arms on the four-bladed propeller&nbsp;blade&nbsp;(granted, that was nice but hardly worth a new set) is about as good as it gets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Compared to #6354 this is really lacking something extra, half the price for less than half the pieces is not really good value (although you can get one a lot cheaper now). Suffice to say, this has never been one of our favourites and both sets we had were more used as parts pack to get a pair of nicer helicopters airborne.</p>
