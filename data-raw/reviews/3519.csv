"Mr_Hobbles","2007-04-16T13:42:24.023Z","An excellent set with lots of charm!","After just getting back into the hobby as an AFOL after a dark age of about 10 years, I discovered this set again on BrickSet.  This was one of the sets I had as a child and I loved it to pieces.  It has a lot of charm!

Everything from the inflatable dingies to the oars, the outboard motor to the backpack, makes this set scream &quot;awesome&quot;.  Quite a high number of minifigs for a set this size too, with an actual female (!), which I gather is pretty rare in a LEGO set these days!

If you can find this set, it's definently worth a buy as an addition to a modern LEGO setting. I bought mine on eBay, with all the pieces in perfect condition (ie. No teeth marks, no discolouration), with an instruction manual and no box for &#163;3.25.  Quite a deal in my opinion and worth every penny.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I really like the overall design of the raft and yet fun to play with. In my opinion, this is a great one to get.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BM_Construction","2009-01-03T13:51:59.06Z","Nice","Cool little raft with lots of neat little accessories like a backpack, hatchet, pick, etc. Very realistic right down to the little motor. And if you don't want your raft to have a motor it can easily be added to another boat.

Interesting note, the picture on my box has a much calmer river than the one on the box above.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The River Runners has something that is unique to this set I think, the crosshatched plate, at least I've never really seen it included in any other LEGO sets, but I could be wrong. The Raft model looks really good because of this plate, it's got yellow sides, if I didn't know any better I'd say they were pontoons. The engine even looks powerful enough to get these people safely over the white water rapids that these thrill seeking Mini-Figures are exploring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is a definite must have for LEGO Town collectors, there are probably a lot of more words I could say about this set, but I believe I've sumarized it up quite well.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"James83","2013-01-04T11:44:28.043Z","Mind the Rapids!","<p>1994 had some great and orginal ideas. This was one of them, a catamaran dingy for having fun in. This set is a must-have if you have Set 6552 Rocky River Retreat, released in 1993.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>A basic build but this raft quite large and&nbsp;very strong. The use of the cones and curved yellow bricks give a great impression of an inflatable dingy and the large grid flat brick looks great. The two hulls feature clips for an array of gear; an oar, an axe, a shovel and a pickaxe. The rear has a large outboard motor that hinges up and down with an antenna as a tiller. In the centre is a small block for carrying a backpack and the front of the raft has a hand-grab. Underneath four carpet studs are fitted.&nbsp;The only flaw is the fact that unless you sit the minifigs at the front, they will slide around and fall over becuase there are no other studs on the floor of the raft. Also stowing the oars and lifejackets means piling them in the middle of the raft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Generously three minifigs are provided. One with green legs, green jacket body, blue shades and stubble head and grey&nbsp;cowboy hat. Another with blue legs, brown bomber jacket, shades and stubble head and male hair. The third has grey legs, lady's blue jacket, female head with lipstick and eyelashes and blue cap. They have an array of outdoor gear as listed above and a lifejacket each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>Certainly a different boat from the usual designs and original in layout. I like it but unless you have the 6652 Rocky River Retreat or other outdoor sets then it might not fit in. But if your minifigs are seeking thrills and adventure and white-water then look no further. Three figures was also an added&nbsp;bonus. </p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
