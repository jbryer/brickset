"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-02T10:21:32.37Z","LEGO Town (Medical) - Ambulance Review","This little vehichle is really valuable and a nice little collector's item. It's the same set which you can see in the first LEGO island videogame. It's a very sturdy truck and this set has no stickers which you need to put on. The ceiling of the vehichle and the doors on each side of the cockpit and the door of the trunk on the back do open. We also get a stretcher with a girl on it. The torso of that lady is really hard to find. This set also comes with a doctor who comes with the ambulance logo on his cap and a nice white uniform. The ambulance set is really easy to build and lot's of fun to play with.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

It has some old school elements but also the newer features. I found it to be a confusing set that doesn't add to neither my town, nor my city).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"gigdoat2","2011-04-02T15:10:10.983Z","An attractive vehicle","<p>This set is great. I'll first review the minifigures, then the ambulance.</p>
<p>The girl, whom the paramedic is rescuing, is a standard LEGO girl. There is not much to say about her. She is a good addition, if you don't have many females in your town.</p>
<p>The paramedic is great. His shirt has a shirt pocket with a pen in it, an EMS logo, and a shirt cuff. It is a great torso. The hat is fantastic, it has the EMS logo on it, a fantastic detail. The paramedic itself is one of my favorite minifigs ever.</p>
<p>The ambulance is very attractive. There is an antenna on top. The sunroof above the driver seat flaps up and down, so you can easily put the paramedic inside. There are also doors on the side of the seat, as you can see. The back of the ambulance, the trunk, is a sunroof piece too. This way it opens up, rather then the new one with doors. The wall with the EMS logo on it is printed, a great piece. The windows are printed, too. It is a very attractive vehicle.</p>
<p>I recommend you get this set. You can get it on eBay, Bricklink, and Amazon. A 5/5 vehicle.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
