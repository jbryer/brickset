"jd5775","2007-08-03T23:11:34.24Z","Often overlooked","I always forget that I have this set in my collection and it really is a great set.  Although there is not much to say about it due to a relatively small amount of pieces, its a great extra vehicle to have in your town.

Pros:
-Basic yet detailed truck (a staple of lego 4 studs)
-Good accessories and minifig
-Brings uniqueness to your lego town

Cons:
-Really none

Overall this is  often overlooked because it's an &quot;under $10 set&quot; however it has some great features.  Sure to bring pothole patching joy to your town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
