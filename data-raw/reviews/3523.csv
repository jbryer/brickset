It is made to be a Tractor truck that has been fixed up to a drag truck. Cool looking truck with adjustable spoiler on the rear of it. Simple clean lines of all of the early 90's Town sets. Straight foward instructions that are easy to follow. Good set - good looking - Go LEGO Go.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I used them on virtually every vehicle build after-wards. It was a very stable kit and easy to build. I enjoyed all the extra special pieces that came with it. At the time a lot of the special pieces were new to me. I had a lot of sets at the time. But this set I remember more than most.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
