"James83","2013-01-04T06:38:41.477Z","The King of the Tow Trucks","<p>I owned three tow trucks, the early and very basic 6656, the larger and more detailed 1572 and this beast. This one was my favourite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The truck echoes the style introduced by Set 6346 Shuttle Launching Crew. It is much more grown-up and American in style than the earlier tow trucks. The chassis has six chunky wheels and external fuel tanks which really look the part. The front has a low grill and headlights, above which are smaller indicator lights and two ridged grill bricks. Attached to the front is a big bull-bar. The driver's cabin is ordinary and the roof has two yellow lights and two big horns. Behind the cab are two huge exhausts which also carry hazard signs to the rear - a great touch and the wine goblet exhasuts at the top just look wonderful. The hazard signs feature two yellow lights, two great looking clear red sloped bricks as bigger hazard lights and a radio antenna. The rear section is made from sloped bricks and two excellent printed logo bricks and at the rear are hooks for a hammer and spanner. Inside there are holders for two road signs and the chunky hook made up from a hinge and a handle brick. This arrangement offers a better hook than the earlier single-piece blocks and is still sturdy enough. The hook has a good reach and the addition of a tow-attachment brick means to can finally get a secure tow around corners. Simply the best towing arrangement Lego had designed. Not only that but it looks 100% realistic and the detailing is stunning for what is still a fairly compact model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>The driver is has blue trousers, the common 1990s green jacket and blue sunglasses and stuble&nbsp;head with a blue cap. He has a hammer and spanner to use as well as the signs to deploy on the road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>None. I loved this practical and good-looking truck so much that I never broke it down and it became the tow-truck of choice. A little gem which in my opinion was never bettered. Why the designers had never concieved of its practical towing system earlier is a mystery. If you can get hold of this set it will make a great addition to any town and provides the muscle to move the biggest of vehicles.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
