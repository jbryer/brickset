All in all I just had many, many hours of fun just building this light plane and flying it around.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:26:00.933Z","Lucky to Own this plane !","One of a number of sets I stumbled across years ago at a yard sale. Like the simple clean lines of the plane, easy to build, looks good, fun to play with. Like the extra fuel tanks for quick fill up between flying lessons. Great older Town set, won't be let down if you get this one for your collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-12-03T22:31:32.2Z","awesome","if u are building  a massive airport, u need more than big jets, u need some smaller private planes or charter airlines. this set is increddibly well desinged complete with over head wing, dual prop engines, some nice cockpit and landing gear pieces and a small refueling canister. the airplane is increddibly detailed for a set this size and includes lots of glowing red dot pieces. great set get it if u can",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My father bought me this set as a child. He has been obcessed with airplanes, especially from World War II, as long as i can remember, so i guess this was an attempt to ""merge"" intrests. 

I really like the design of this set, it's not very big, but it's not completely small either, so it's a medium sized plane. I think it looks realistic in a way that not many other of the smaller plane's pull of. It's not a complicated build, but still it's not one of those builds, that's over before you begin it. I'd say that the time it takes to build, is a nice time. It doesn't take so long that you get frustrated, and it's not so short that it's not even fun. When the set is assembled, it has lot's of playability.

The set is really sturdy to, the tail section is by far it's weakest part. The wing section opens up, for easy access to the inside of the plane. Unfortunatly, the wings come of way to easy, when opening them. A nice feature on the inside, is the brick, that has instrument's on them. Nice little detail. I really also like the side windows, i can't remember seeing other sets with this feature.

I think that the small gass pump is a nice feature. Unfortunatly, i lost mine many years ago. :( I hope to replace it some day. Overall, it's a really nice set, and as mentioned in another review, your town airport need's more than just big commercial jets.

This set resembles the Turbo prop (6687) in it's design, and that is another plane i would really like to own someday. Unfortunatly, it's not easy at all to find the older models complete here in denmark, but as thay say, everything comes to those who have patience. I am allso seriously considering getting the new  Seaplane (3178), only because i think it looks a bit like this one. They must have based the design of of this set. I generelly don't like the newer sets, so the seaplane might very well be the first new Lego set i get in 10 years.

Anyway, i would recommend this set to absolutely everyone, who enjoys Lego's in any way shape or form, and if your town has an Airport, you should wait no longer! Hunt this set down, right now, you will not regret it.

A top 5/5 from me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-03T15:23:35.243Z","Solo Trainer Review","<p>I know I got this plane as the Turbo Prop I that I had gotten from my Aunt was missing pieces and this set was part of a phase in youth wanting to get all of the lego sets that I could and this felt like a ""replacement"" to the Turbo Prop... I'd have a plane that's complete and not missing any pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coloring of Red, White &amp; Blue has me feeling a little patriotic when looking at this plane, you get one minifigure&nbsp;who pilots it and then some ground equipment for playing at refueling the plane or working on it. It's not too much of a variant build then the Turbo Prob and it is a good solid set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"craigpowers","2011-09-10T16:18:43.23Z","Great starter set and parts donor","This set scores high, in my opinion, for many reasons.<div><br></div><div>First, is the playability of the set. &nbsp;As it is, the airplane is well-built and features twin props and is of nice size and dimension. &nbsp;The added fuel tank and tools provide the other aspects of aviation, that being the mechanics and ground operations.</div><div><br></div><div>Second, is the build. &nbsp;The airplane takes mere minutes to assemble, and the fuel tank and tool rack aren't even worth mentioning, but the final product is well-detailed and functional. &nbsp;One of the nicer features of this set is the hinged roof which allows you to ""peel"" open the wings to sit the pilot in. &nbsp;The plane's simple construction also allows you to take it apart and rebuild it from memory without the instructions, which, to me is a plus and shows attention to design and detail on Lego's part, especially when it becomes intuitive how a set should come together.</div><div><br></div><div>And, lastly, the set is expandable, in that it provides unique pieces like propellers, wings, wheels, and a tailpiece that could be used to build your own idea of an aircraft, thus further lending to playability of this set.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"James83","2012-08-04T12:05:34.88Z","High Flyer","<p>This was one of the few aircraft sets I owned but I think its one of the best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This set looks good, the proportions are right, it looks like an aircraft and generally is a well thought-out design. Its a fairly sleek aircraft with lots of sloping bricks to build up the lower fuselage and rear fuselage. The white-blue-red theme goes very well and is continued on the tail. The two 2x3 sloped bricks to carry the undercarriage look neat too, the three sloping undercarriage legs are very useful and offer a stable base when taxying. The cockpit is accessed by lifting the wing, which is hinged at the rear. The wing is sturdy and easily opens and closes. The cockpit itself is fairly spacious and has ample all-round view with a narrow windscreen and lower windows. The propeller bricks look good and give this a nice general aviation theme and coloured warning lights are also included. The inclusion of the Shell themed fuel tank and spanner is nice considering they aren't essential extras and could easily have been omitted to cut costs. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>This intrepid pilot has a plain blue top with white arms and a red cap. Pretty average.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>This aircraft is an excellent addition to any airport theme you might have. It gets away from that corporate airline theme and allows your pilot to do some aerobatic stunts or make a flying doctor call in the wildneress or generally get from A to B. It makes a nice change from building cars and trucks and it looks great. I think this is probably the best looking Lego aircraft being realisctic in design&nbsp;without looking too basic. It certainly outshines the ultralights on offer at the time. A great little set that you can develop further into other aircraft. </p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
