This one is awesome in terms of looks - the big tailpipes are great and the black/yellow scheme is superb. The only thing that would have been even better is if it had been given suspension like some of the newer sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-02-06T23:51:26.56Z","Great Truck","I really like this set alot. It is so perfect in every way possible. The doors with the red and yellow stripes are very cool and goes with the other colors in this set. The wheels are very cool and looks like it can conquer any trail. Lego should really make more sets like this because some sets don't come close to this. 5 out of 5 for a great flawless set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"albcheng123","2009-09-23T02:14:08.247Z","Rare Big Wheel Set","With 4 gigantic wheels (each of them comprises of 2 Technic wheels) and cool black outlook, the 4-WD vehicle should be capable to overcome adverse terrain.

The set also has a twin cousin ""4-Wheelin' Truck (6641)"" with more colorful outlook.

Pros:
- Rare Big-wheel vehicle design
- 2 ""car doors"" with Red and Yellow Stripes Pattern
- Cool Minifig with ""Town Trucker Logo""

Cons:
- Big Wheels are not firmly attached to the vehicle body


Generally speaking, the set offers lots of funs for building and should be a core member for every Lego Town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jake9","2010-10-10T00:38:31.53Z","Fun LEGO 4x4","I remember this set back when it came out. I was a kid and I loved the black and yellow color scheme, the graphic on the doors, and the minifig in a tanktop shirt.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The truck actually uses four wheels per axle, so there is a total of eight wheels. There are two large exhaust tips coming out the back and it adds a hot rod feel. It's a small truck lengthwise, but it's very fun to roll around. The build goes a little quick but it's a small set. In the end, it's a cool LEGO 4x4 with unique colors and very fun too.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
