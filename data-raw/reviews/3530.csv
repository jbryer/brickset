"Loganwan","2008-02-26T17:54:35.543Z","Command of the Town","This was a great set in my collection.  This was the only police force I ever owned, but they did a great job patrolling the streets of Legoland.

The van is a little goofy since it is so skinny, as many of the vehicles at that time were.  It is definitely dated compared to the newer police and fire sets out there, but it had all of the essentials of the time.  The best part was opening the giant side door and revealing the large map on the wall, and the computer system.  With the road blocks, this was a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The purpose or job of the minifigure characters can be inspirational and help create a smart set. More tricky to nail in model form, however are less obvious careers and services or, a van type that has had repeated incarnations. As with the latter problem, things are perhaps ever more difficult now Lego have released emergency service sets ad nauseum but during the golden age of the Town theme, a new take on an existing idea was much more exciting when successful, so lets look at this 1986 take on a police van.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Unusual flat white cap and zipper print uniform combination.</li><li>CB radio, red light signal, megaphone.</li></ul>Optionally they could also use a small box receiver/transmitter and a large radar that unclips from the rear of the van.</div><div><br><div><b>Stake Out</b></div></div><div>These two form some kind of CID squad, see the review title for what this usually implies for a stakeout. For rather less covert operations this command unit was a removal from the standard Police vans that were mostly for throwing suspects in to the back of. This excellent model gets a small chassis and wheel arch laid with other plates across a two piece base. Surely there was a long enough piece in production but its thirteen studs long, fourteen would have guaranteed more base strength with a bumper but the design unfolds as an honest build, through and through.</div><div><br></div><div>The wheels are small and early white editions. Rear lights slip under the back and simply hang there, not always ideal. White plates build up the sides overlapping with typical integrity. The smart van is deserving of a smart chair but a black side-angle plate is reversed instead with the steering wheel. A stripe of black bricks and plates continues upwards with the round yellow headlights as often used, set around a print grill, not the best vehicle front. Smooth long tile pieces begin to suggest the main feature on an opening section and happy day, a computer is built in to the back of the van (did everyone get excited to discover printed technology on a slanted brick?).</div><div><br></div><div>Clip-in windows were something pretty special and matched the side panels as highly useful replacements for bricks where kids need to manoeuvre minifigures inside or stand/sit them sideways, the chunky, four stud wide rascals. The rest just&nbsp;builds high around the panels to accommodate standing cops though chairs would have been fine (they like to sit down at work). The radar clip is again, very honestly built in at the back for that large and constructed aerial and dish. The new front high-top brick was great and still makes the van look superb.&nbsp;A strange arrangement of plates on top, ends at this point and then you realise why.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than have a double hinged opening section sat across the middle of the van, the design has it offset one stud along. This allows the entire back roof to open but it is not necessary for the last one stud section. The front, while unsymmetrically complete in multiple roof plates, finishes this honest build of all required components without any 'cheat' bricks. The simple circular blue lights on circular white plate seems minimalist and pretty cool and has an antennae in between as if they did not pack enough radio gear already! For slinging in the back are these great printed (ouch I wish i'd looked after these) long tile 'Police' barriers with alert arrow stripes sat on some one stud sideways build plates (how do you name bricks?)</div><div><br></div><div>This unit comes packing stickers. Fiddly for inept kids who lacked dexterity, I probably felt faint holding my breath, using every ounce of concentration to place them right but it was worth it. They emblazon 'Police', unsurprisingly, across the back, sides and on that excellent front high-top panel. Finally what guarantees this product sale is the map sticker, who could resist?! It sits inside the side panel and completes the reconnaissance themed van, the cops can monitor the entire Town, it even shows a railway line.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">						</span>Alternative Building</h4><p>The other van you can make is not worth mentioning, it can not match the main model I'm afraid.</p><div><b>Stand Down The Back-Up</b></div><div>This tall, smart high-top van is an exciting and smart piece of cop kit circa 1986, dwarfed by later Police convoys of giant wagons, super trucks and no doubt aircraft carriers. Surely a Lego designer with unfortunate right wing tendencies got put on the Police subtheme at some point in the 1990s? Every Town and City set became almost threatened of including an armed officer on its corner, such an image being enough to make the Town postmen require body armour.&nbsp;Aside from a minor flaw&nbsp;and some lacking pieces, chairs for instance, this set is a marvellous, gear packed sensation that barely misses full marks for a somewhat unnecessary roof layout, its one of the best Police models of all time. The only things left that a new mobile command unit should offer is mugs of coffee and ring donuts.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"James83","2012-07-14T11:49:41.87Z","Riot Control!","<p>Shortly after I received Police Station set 6386 I spent some of my Christmas money on this little gem. After all, any good Lego&nbsp;Police force deserves a mobile unit. This was the forerunner of the later truck and trailer-based command units but this is much more compact and quite ingenious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The van itself is quite a complex build for a vehicle of its era but the opening roof and wall unit is quite ingenious, opening to reveal the nerve-centre with its excellent map sticker and computer block. The highroof block over the windscreen is fairly rare but makes this vehicle look quite sleek from the front. The opening section is pretty sturdy. The twin window side units look good too. The negatives are the printed radiator block which looks a little out of place and the slab-sided appearance from the side. The blue and white lights on the roof are&nbsp;a nice touch as is the large antenna on the back. The two Police road block signs were also a worthy addition. This set is nearly worth it for those and the wall map sticker alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Two of Legoland's finest are on patrol with this set. One in a police bikers uniform and one in a police suit and shirt. I guess the zipped suit policeman is the driver and the smarter policeman is probably the officer in the back. Useful hand-held gear includes megaphone, traffic baton, walkie-talkie and traffic light. There is not much you're left wanting with this set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>Well you couldn't do much else with this set, it wasn't spacious enough to become a campervan but the map sticker became a useful peice of street furniture as a tourist map. Still the main point is that this set makes for a great car chase finale with roadblocks and all. With its neat touches this must be one of the best of the 1980s Police sets.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
