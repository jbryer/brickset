"pheared","2008-06-22T16:44:04.513Z","The total package!","I remember playing with 6677 as a child, and it being one of my favorite sets -- the blue motorcycle was a cherished item (and having it come complete with racing numbers was a fantastic touch of detail.) The SUV-esque vehicle that is included has great playing potential, ready to be taken off-road even with its old-style connected wheels. The minifig in his racing suit with the classic black helmet makes for the perfect driver!

The only things lacking are a kickstand for the trailer, and maybe a ramp off the back (a single hinged plate even) for easy loading/unloading.

With its bright yellow color theme and multi-vehicle options, &quot;Motocross Racing&quot; screams 'good time' -- and many I've had with it! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Lego has done three variations of this design, what's not to love with a truck hauling around a motorcycle to some dirtbike riding or go to a rally race? This set features one of two blue motorcycles I've got of this style. The yellow truck looks like it's made to handle rough terrian and haul the motorcycle out to the back roads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set has been lots of fun and creates a lot of possibility for play, especially with other similiar sets like it.</p>
