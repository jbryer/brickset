The rear section represents an engine housing and makes a realistic overhang that balances its load bearing, 'business' end.</div><div><br></div><div>The driver's cab has black pneumatic control sticks with the steering wheel and chair that are protected by a black railed bar section with a brilliant yellow warning 'beacon' finishing the main section. It would be suitable that every construction worker comes with a mug of hot drink in their cab if not their hand?</div><div><br></div><div>The windscreen and lights are basic enough but the fun starts in front of this with the pneumatic arm that holds the thick black hinge that was a model changing brick of this age. Its socket brick ends the arm to hold a ball jointed giant yellow, spring-loaded bucket. Exciting beyond belief at the time but a component built alternative would probably be the current TFOL &amp; AFOL preference. What quite inspired this brick is unknown because it certainly got used but also abused to lengths of car crushing, house wrecking, bank heists and provocatively grabbing anything that belonged to siblings. Suffice to say MFs can be a victim of such dangerous machinery.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Crushing The Competition</b></div><div>Despite the practical lifter-dropper capability of the crane, it seems to win out as more of a demolition set. The one piece brick term escapes me but the bucket also succeeds unusually because it worked so well. A fully built version would also be a welcome feature in future sets.&nbsp;A smashing success.</div></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
