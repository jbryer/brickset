The minifig seems to be nice with the spetacular tow truck. This is sure to be a Lego Legend indeed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chris38911","2023-01-02T15:14:34.57Z","Random blue helmet??","<p>This is another USA-only set that I Bricklinked and built in the UK, I even managed to get a set of original instructions - and in good order - but I did cheat a bit and got reproduction stickers to avoid the costs of getting rare parts sent from across the pond......</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Nothing complicated, a classic 80&#39;s vehicle build. The tow truck is very similar to the one in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6363-1/Auto-Repair-Shop"">6363 Auto Repair Shop</a>&nbsp;and the car is very simple but well made.&nbsp;I am surprised we didn&#39;t see more of that style of car in 80&#39;s sets -&nbsp; but it does use a lot of pieces in this build (the classic 4x7x2/3 vehicle base wasn&#39;t released&nbsp;until 7 years after this set).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Straight out of the classic 80s parts bin - nothing special for the main build, although the headlight bricks, 2x&nbsp;blue bars and the larger tyres on the tow truck were brand-new parts when this set came out. Only rare parts are the Exxon-printed torso for the single minifig&nbsp;and the stickered parts - which are difficult to source outside the USA.&nbsp;Stickers on the blue doors and on the 2x2 white tile on the front of the car - I guess the white tile sticker was solely to make printing the door stickers worthwhile.....</p>

<p>And, why the blue helmet? No-one to wear it and no vehicle requiring a helmet in the set???</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Excellent. Perfect for your Lego town at the time, and capable of towing pretty much all your town vehicles at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I really like this simple set - nice build and great playability.&nbsp;But never available in the UK/Europe -&nbsp;Exxon isn&#39;t a recognisable&nbsp;brand on this side of the pond, and I guess Lego UK and Europe&#39;s relationship with Shell (at the time) would prevent it. It&#39;s a shame Lego didn&#39;t do a re-colourised or Shell version of this set, like the did with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/554-1/Fuel-Pumper"">554 Fuel Pumper (Exxon)</a>&nbsp;&amp; <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/671-1/Shell-Petrol-Tanker"">671 Shell Petrol Tanker</a>, or like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6696-1"">6696 Fuel Tanker (Exxon)</a> &amp; <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6695-1/Tanker-Truck"">6695 Tanker Truck (Shell)&nbsp;</a></p>
