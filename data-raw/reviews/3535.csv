Further experience of this type of vehicle showed that the ambulance&#39;s size mean it required more creativity in its design to accommodate the vehicle length.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The colour and exterior design of the ambulance are striking, with an obviously recognisable red cross and realistic-looking shaded windows. The lights and sirens stand out well, in what would become a familiar configuration on Legoland Town vehicles. The stretcher is a neat addition - a simple build, yet easily recognisable and fun to play with.&nbsp;</p>
