It featured the new pop top roofs (nearly all vehicles prior to 1981 didn't have roofs!!), a walkie talkie, signal and road barriers.  The truck itself was beautifully designed, with the larger wheels giving it an imposing presence on town roads as well as ample storage space for the gear.   After all these years, still one of my favourite Town vehicles.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My dad had come back from a trip and gave this to me and my eyes popped out in awe. I was expecting a toy but I wasn&#39;t expecting this. This was my first Police themed set. I loved the mini figure with his printed torso and peak cap. The red road cones, the large wheels, the grill - all were so new and exciting to play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building it up was straight forward and many times the radio was imagined to be a weapon. The storage in the back of the van was more than enough to hold the cones and the barrier and then some. The additional builds&nbsp;printed on&nbsp;the back of the box were pretty cool. Only build fail among all of them was the&nbsp;bulldozer - could not figure out making that the way the picture showed it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only bummer was stickers instead of printed pieces&nbsp;for the &quot;Police&quot; on the doors. A few years back I went through an old duffel&nbsp;my parents had stored the old Legos in to find these old sets.&nbsp;I was able to find most pieces for this set and though the stripped stickers on the barrier were still there,&nbsp;the &quot;Police&quot; stickers were no longer on the doors. The shutters on the van were also really loose and the torso of the mini figure had worn down to&nbsp;all black. I got some after market stickers for all that needed fixing and after salvaging parts that&nbsp;I could, I built&nbsp;a&nbsp;smaller sized van as an MOC. I also got a good deal on an excellent condition used set and constructing the full set again brought back such awesome memories. I now have both displayed side-by-side.&nbsp;Both mini figures now also have custom pistols from Sidan</p>
