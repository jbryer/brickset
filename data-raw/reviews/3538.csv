"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T00:23:39Z","I need a burger!","Nice set, great place of a snack. Good details and color use. Comes with 2 minifigs. There just are not enough of these little food stalls! Just off the top of my head, there is only this and the pizzaria. They should make more: hot dog stand, ice-cream parlour, soda shop, fast food restaurants ..... so many possibilities.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-05-04T17:45:14.64Z","just nice","A lovely design, two minifigs, a place to get some burger... those sets are the true heart of every city. Not just police stations and fire stations, the sets lego produced in the 80s were the real thing. There should be sets like this today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-06T21:56:26.843Z","Mmm... Burgers","This is an ultra cool set and good for any Lego town. I like the little building where it is and the minifigure chef. The sign is very cool with a burger on it. The umbrella bench is very cool and is a nice part of this set. This one should also be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pickwick","2010-10-09T15:31:23.04Z","Qui veut des burgers ???","Les années 80, les meilleures années Lego.<br>En voici la preuve avec cette boîte colorée et sympathique : une petite boutique où un charmant cuistot vend ses burgers à une charmante cliente à couettes qui va se rendre ensuite en terrasse pour le dévorer, tout en prenant un petit café.<br>Donc, dans cette boîte, des autocollants, deux minifigs (le chef avec sa toque et une minifig rouge à couettes), deux tasses, un parasol, et un burger représenté par un assemblage de plate 1x1 coloré.<br>La construction est rapide et le bâtiment une fois monté est solide. Le seul inconvénient, ce sont les autocollants qui avec le temps, ont tendance à se décoller (autocollants présents sur la porte transparente et sur les deux briques blanches assemblées sur le toit).<br><br><a href=""http://brick-a-pickwick.over-blog.com/article-6683-vente-de-hamburger-hamburger-stand-58412532.html"">Pour voir plus de photos, cliquer ici</a>.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

All themes around this have been, now and again (and currently), dominated by too many emergency services. As great as those sets are, its fair to note that real town features that kids recognise seem to provide all the danger, drama, crime and crisis that keeps the popular emergency services employed.

Certainly no restaurant, this set has charm coming out of its brick sauce bottle. The colourful umbrella, drink, ice cream window sign and juicy hamburger badge (all stickers for this set) all attract the average hungry minifigure to come and buy a snack.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The smart stand has a blue stripe through yellow in the main build with a black tiled roof and a blue stripe through white top sign. The serving hatch opens on to the street where the cook/chef/baker can serve up what actually looks like an attempt at a brick burger- the brown bricks where lacking in this era. There is a clear mug for the female customer who can stand under the shade- sadly no chair. The swing glass, blue framed door and hatch map a fun imagination zone within, open backed of course to allow easy play.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Beefburger To Go</b></div><div>This remains a favourite over all modern offerings and Lego need more like this. Small Town sets should consist of everyday life before the Police state and Fireman empire take over. I can not recommend highly enough to find or re-create. I genuinely believe it should get full marks for its year but to balance that, it does happen to be my favourite set. :P</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"phipfwe76","2011-05-27T16:31:43.697Z","Who's hungry?","<p>Picked this set up a few months ago online. My city seemed kind of bland with all the police and fire sets being released now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hamburger Stand comes with a chef, who I feel every lego owner should have, and a patron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is pretty standard, with there not really being much to the stand other then a walkup window and a little area to order from inside. There's a picture of some food on the door, and what is suppose to be a hamburger on the roof, however it really looks nothing like one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the ultimate addition to a city in my opinion. It's very unique and can fit almost anywhere due to its small size. I really wish Lego would put out more sets like this rather then the same old cops and robbers we've gotten used to seeing.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Nesquik","2012-09-04T15:47:05.937Z","The Brick-Burgers on me!","This really is a sweet little set, but that's certainly not unusual for late 70's/80's LegoLand.<div><br></div><div>The strengths of this product can be found in the usual three categories that were prioritised by TLG for many years, and those are colour composition, playability and parts. What we have here is the perfect Lego set, because all those boxes are ticked off in perfect fashion.</div><div><br></div><div>Just take a look at the wonderfully simple use of colours to denote different parts of the building. Bold yellows with blue and white highlights make this a very summery-looking Hamburger Stand, and the black tiled roof reiterates the almost 'prefab' nature of such small stalls, which are commonly seen in parks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You may be wondering just how common 'Hamburger Stands' are in reality, and the truth is they're likely not as common as you would think, but the westernisation of this stand does little to immediately make me think of the U.S. It's a very universal design.</div><div><br></div><div>Unusually for a product of this era, it does contain two large stickers, although they won't impact the re-building process should take it apart. Only the main burger logo on the two 4x1 bricks are stuck together.&nbsp;To me, this detailing really makes the building standout, the logos are so bright and detailed. These would have made lovely printed pieces!</div><div><br></div><div>Inside, the chef has a small till and kitchen area where he can prepare food. If you enjoy MOCs, then this is a great set to extend and properly fit out the inside, as for playability purposes, it is of course very basic. As well as the classic chef, you also get a lady town figure in a red outfit/jumpsuit.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a glorious product and it perfectly epitomises what is so great about Lego.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
