"lordjim13","2006-08-01T05:45:10Z","Cool little set","To my everlasting regret, I believe I soon lost one of the two side panels that made this set so cool (the ones on the van that say police on them), so I could never truly rebuild it after a few years.  Nice compact set, not as over-the-top as later things.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2007-10-04T07:28:13.78Z","Another 80s classic","This set has great playability with both Police van (or paddy wagon as we say in Australia) and bike.  The 80s bikes remain, for my money, streets ahead of the honking great things being released now.  The van serves as a great prisoner transport or riot/SWAT squad deployment vehicle - a couple of these and you can put some serious presence out there on the streets!  Also it's more nicely car sized than the current 6-wide offerings, which stray too much into truck territory.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotowner","2011-03-05T23:06:45.317Z","At speed the back doors flew open!","<p>I remember getting this set and was really happy with it, though it very rarely got built. I got it after 6623 and 6386 and so I was already pretty satisfied with my police force. I never had many criminals to catch as my town at this stage consisted of mostly policeman, fireman and other services.</p>
<p>The set had two problems for me. When driving the back doors would open right out, not a good look for the police force and the two side panels faded very quickly and lost their colour. Also the bike was a different colour to 6386 and 6522 when that arrived, had a cool visor which wasnt in the other sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,3
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-09T03:10:08.78Z","GET IN THE BACK OF THE VAN!","<p>Your brother&#39;s annoying male MF with red girl hair keeps stealing the yellow four stud supplies from your MOC bakery. The baker&#39;s had enough:&nbsp;the freak is going down.&nbsp;That&#39;s not quite how it happened but is a roughly typical of the crime scale that any right wing MF police force crack down upon to keep their plastic town clean, and free of the weirdness introduced by my siblings custom MFs. And this is how they do it:</p>

<div><b>Minifigures:</b></div>

<div>
<ul>
	<li>Police van driver with the usual white cap and shirted uniform.</li>
	<li>Police biker with zipper top and white helmet (visor free era).</li>
</ul>

<div><b>Town Patrol</b></div>
The bike has its excellent police windshield that requires careful looking after, the chunky square blue light and essential police signs. The rider and drivers torso prints were a little weak in definition but got printed stronger later on. They were easily scuffed too.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>As four stud vans go its quite straight forward but makes a an appealing design with its blue grill. The double roof lights are excellent and the whole black and white police pattern is very smart, 20th century and North American to my mind, much better than the modern blue and white. The standout bricks here are the grilled police windows. Very attractive but the print is easily worn out in boxes (ouch).&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The grilled section shuts down one side from a roof hinge to hold the criminal (yes criminal not suspect, of course he&#39;s guilty, who ever heard of a Lego court?!) inside the prisoner unit. He is even lucky enough to get a smart blue chair and a view through those cool grill windows. White shutters at the back seem an unnecessary lack of security but finish the end of the police van.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Their Law</b></div>

<div>An excellent set that gave the police station a van and extra bike to hunt down capture and bring back wrong doers and put them behind bars. This worthy set gives the police some extra power and respect... that is until someone builds batman and controls the crime and vigilante ends of the city, making the police force look stupid. Only an older sibling plays this way!</div>

"BrickbyBrickDFM","2020-10-31T11:36:27.23Z","Back to the Basics - 1980s LEGO Building Experience ","<p>LEGO set 6684,&nbsp;Police Patrol Squad is a classic that has a total of 77 pieces, including two police officers minifigures. The minifigures have a retro look to them, that really goes with the style of the vehicle that one can build.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;police motorcycle includes&nbsp;a printed windscreen that reminds me of the old Police&nbsp;TV show Chips.&nbsp;The other vehicle is a police transport van that has a side accessible door with printed windows.</p>

<p>This set is not only affordable, the playability is unlimited. Back in the days, I would play for hours with this set as I imagined myself serving and protecting my small LEGO town. &nbsp;Overall, I am still an excited to owe this set. &nbsp;It will always be a classic that brings me back to the basics of building. &nbsp;</p>
