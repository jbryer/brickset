The figure is fine if you are looking for a generic pirate to build up your forces.  I could do without the shark and bird as they are in nearly every other set.
Simple, easy, but I would not go looking for it just to have it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-09T17:30:57.983Z","Another little pirate set","The Pirates Desert Island is a set that is much playable and with some useful pieces. It includes an pirate good and simple designed minifigure, that also have a hat and a weapon. The bird on the set is just one pice, and no playable, but still good painted. The shark is like all the lego classic shark  minifigures, gray, simple and cool, but only the mouth is playable. The flag is just a little piece, but also cool to use on sets like this, and in other sets from the pirates theme. The other pieces are basically few to illustrate the pirate instalation on this desert island. Unfortunately, this set have few pieces and also is not much playable, but still in classic style.
I rate the Pirates Desert Island 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

They make this set look cool and fun to play with. The flag will be useful to notice nearby ships. Just another good set under $10 when it was first released.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2010-10-19T21:41:50.23Z","Pirate Island Value Pack","<p>This set comes as part of a Value Pack that gives a person a taste or sampling of several different smaller sets from the different Legoland themes of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best feature is the small pot as that's an accessory piece not usually seen or found. Gold matey! I personally liked the parrot and sharks and was always looking to get more. The flag is a general white one, suggesting that the pirate might be marooned and looking for help. Though I'm not sure I'd call the set an island.. more like a spot along a sandy beach or coast where he's hanging out at.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
