The only thing I remember, though, is that my cousin came home and took it apart.  Years later my dad bought it again and it remains mostly in one piece.  I love how with simple pieces Lego would come up with the most wonderful designs.  No need for an exotic piece for the windshield...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I love the yellow tubes, the yellow &quot;space guns!&quot;, and especially the flawless design of the helicopter.  Plus all those pieces are nice and versatile for making alternative models too. 

One of these days I'm going to make a fleet of helicopters just like this one!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T15:22:01.403Z","Lovely model of fire copter","This model brings back a lot of good memories. It wasn't me that got it, but it was my brother's. I believe he got it from my grandparents. It is just so cute and adorable, I saw it a few years ago, flying above a wooden (not-lego) castle. Of course it wasn't flying, but it was hanging on a fish wire or something ;-). I agree with others commenting that it was a really good set for the town's flying forces!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"clundsberg","2010-08-18T22:15:29.99Z","Very First Set Ever (that came with the lego guy)!","<p>I remember my Danish relatives visiting us in the states and they gave this to me as a gift.&nbsp; Now I had had lego sets before: the uber vintage Scooter, Biplane, Learjet, etc...but this was my first taste of a set that came with a tiny smiley-faced lego guy.&nbsp; Nothing can get this dude down!&nbsp; But who can blame him?&nbsp; He gets to fly around in a sweet chopper, blasting away fires and he came with cool ax n walkie-talkie accessories!<br/>The instructions are tattered n torn, the set dismantled and I'm more than certain a few parts are missing. I still recognize my firefighter as my first glimpse into a fun new world of toys (and I see this in my son now too) so perhaps I shall hunt down a few missing pieces and reconstruct this most excellent set.&nbsp; I still have the pieces with the stickers, so its a good start.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"city_transport_rox","2012-04-15T23:10:26.133Z","Didn't even know I had it until now!","Today i have reviewed many of the older LEGO sets. Then I found out that I had some interesting parts such as a helicopter&nbsp;propeller, an upside-down windscreen an axe, radio and some unusual yellow pieces. I decide to look up older helicopters and find this. It comes with 1 minifig in a helicopter with fire-fighting equipment. Although it is a little tight in the helicopter, the minifig still fits quite well. I have every piece exept the back propeller. Overall a great set to help fight fires in your town.",FALSE,4,5,4,5,4
