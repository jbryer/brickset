The digger itself isn&#39;t great but nonetheless it has a front tipper and a back hoe with articulation. This era of sets irritated me that all the extras, e.g. the rubble and the signs couldn&#39;t be carried in one go which I felt made it less realistic. That said, I would be complaining if they weren&#39;t included!!</p>

<p>The outstanding element (literally) to this set is the minifig&#39;s&nbsp;blue hard hat. It is the only set that Lego made with this colour. I don&#39;t know why they did but that is exactly why I love this set!</p>
