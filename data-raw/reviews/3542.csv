The colors of the plane are very nice and makes it look good too. The minifig with the sticks is pretty cool too. A good set to get if you can find it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2011-02-03T15:19:27.957Z","Turbo Prop I Review","<p>I recieve this set from my Aunt as part of a group of lego sets that were incomplete and missing pieces... As such I don't feel I've ever gotten to properly enjoy this set the way it's meant to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun little build if you like airplanes, two minifigures, a pilot and ground control/direction. It has a good constrast of colors and solid build. Just never having much of a Lego Airfield or Airport, this set was always a bit out of place for me.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,5
"AstroTech","2010-10-10T09:59:02.713Z","A true classic.","This set has some special value to me. Living in the GDR in 1988, it was not easy to get LEGO sets. But for christmas and birthdays our relatives in Western Germany used to send us so-called ""Westpakete"", big packages with all sorts of stuff from there. They often contained fruit like bananas and oranges, ""Milka"" chocolate, clothes etc., and that year, I got such a package for my seventh birthday. This contained this LEGO set. I was very much into planes and helicopters anyway, so this was double joy. This little plane instantly became my favourite toy and since then.<br><div>This all-5 review might be heavily influenced by nostalgic feelings, but the set still looks classic and very well designed today. It is definitely a must for every airport or other aviation-themed LEGO setting.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
