that is a value lego has lost during the last years. here it shines through vividly, giving us a moment of melancholy remembrance of the past.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-06-04T09:08:55.903Z","Simple but fantastic","Oh, I do love the sets of the 80s! They were quite simple but had a very special and unique charm! This ambulance car is no exception, of course. It does not have many details. One of the very few details are the doors. The car's interior looks quite bare. The driver doesn't even have a seat on which you can put him. But who cares? This little set is so amazing to look at! I particularly like the hinges which you can open to put the driver behind the windscreen plus the ones in the back. In the back part you can put the stretcher either with or without a patient lying on it. 

Nearly all bricks that are used for this vehicle are white or red. These are the classic colours for hospitals and ambulance cars. The wheels of this set are very nostalgic. They aren't anything special, but they are not available anymore. Take care of the white 2x2 tile with the red cross on the car's roof. It's quite rare. Unfortunately, I lost that brick a long time ago. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For the rest it looks like a slapped together ugly little ambulance. that neither goes with the 1980 nor 1987 releases. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<p>This is a great set for it&#39;s time given, let me explain!</p>

<p>I bought one for the printed elements and ambulance driver mainly. On the roof (2x2 plate) and on the sides are standard red hospital cross prints (panel pieces), these logo prints where discontinued after the ambulance of 94. The red cross was replaced by a with snake on a blue background.</p>

<p>The figures can enter the very sturdy ambulance by an back door and two doors on the side. Huge minifigures can place the driver in by an opening roof. The car is very spacious for the patient, especially for the cute 4 studs wide range. But there&#39;s not so much space for the driver sadly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of patient and driver: the patient to start with has an basic blue torso with white arms, bleu legs, basic smily face and regular female hair for it&#39;s time. The doctor/driver on the other hand has an jacket as torso with a red cross on the side, white pants, brown hair and a smily face, he gets a stretcher to move the patient.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great little play set for kids to have. And an great set for AFOL fans for the printed elements and docter/driver!</p>

<p>PS: this was my first review, my grammer sucks because my school doesn&#39;t give English :3</p>
