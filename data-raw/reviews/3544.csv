"Cornwell","2008-05-03T19:53:23.17Z","Simple yet elegant","The Post-station is one of those kits I will always remember fondly, and in retrospect, it's a great kit. 

I had both the postal van (6651) and the little motorbike with a sidecar (6622) and this kit tied it all nicely together. The mailbox is set into the wall, and opens on the inside of the tiny post-office, meaning that nobody will be able to tamper with the mail. There's a small desk, and the opening hours are printed on the door, which was a lighter model that emerged at this time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

No idea how it came in my possession, best guess is a thrift store or flea market purchase. This is one of a whopping five sets I&#39;ve unearthed that are actually older than me, by a good amount too, so I&#39;d imagine this thing came secondhand. A few of the parts in the baggie younger me had substituted for other pieces, the baseplate wasn&#39;t in great shape, but with a little creativity with spares I have I managed to 1:1 create this set again so I can have it in front of me for review purposes.</p>

<p>This is one of a whopping maybe five or six at most post office related sets Lego has ever produced, ever. I find this particularly odd considering that (at least in the USA) literally EVERY city has a post office, it&#39;s probably the most common building you can find in the parts I live in and have visited. Every kid in the universe has seen a post office, but Lego has made extremely few of them. Not sure why this is, probably just the whole &quot;a kid wouldn&#39;t get all that excited about it&quot; thing that is fundamentally true, sadly. As a kid myself I always much more enjoyed sets that resembled things I see every day in miniature rather than some licensed movie tie in or a space shuttle or something. This probably has a lot to do with my growing older adult hobby of model railroading, wherein modelling things that you see every day as realistically and mundanely as possible is the stated goal. Maybe I&#39;m just boring and was boring as a kid, who knows.</p>

<p>Either way, there are not a lot of sets like this and most of the ones that are (interestingly) are actually even older than this one. Of the official, Lego-made non-MOC post office sets, this is usually the easiest one to acquire for the average Joe. Is it great? Well, yes, but that&#39;s mostly because of the extreme lack of competition. Could it be better? Quite a bit so, as I&#39;ll get into. That said the complaints I have are minor and the complements major so I figure a four star rating is fair.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong> Boy, oh boy, does this thing not look like an American post office. That said it isn&#39;t attempting to be an American post office either, so that doesn&#39;t really bother me. I remember being real confused as a kid as to why there was a curvy french horn logo thing all over this set and just figured it was a Lego fantasy design like Octan is. Turns out I was wrong, that&#39;s actually the logo of Denmark&#39;s postal service. When you&#39;re in your late 20&#39;s you think to research such things. When you&#39;re ten you really don&#39;t.</p>

<p>That said this looks like half of a post office. The building seems to have been bisected but that&#39;s understandable, buildings with four walls in Lego form are few and far between because you really can&#39;t play with anything if you can&#39;t reach it. What is here is a fantastic looking model complete with a mail drop box in the front, a desk with a bell on it, and a post office sign and door with stickers. It is a simple and effective building that&#39;s hard to believe Lego didn&#39;t bring back considering how small the thing is.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>the biggest reason I&#39;m not giving this a five. Building it is fine for the first majority of it, the walls are well re-enforced (something Lego seems to have forgotten how to do come the nineties), the baseplate is plenty big, the desk looks like a desk... But then we run into two problems. One: Stickers. The mailbox is printed, the door and sign are not. The sign sticker is a sticker over assembly, meaning those are two 1x4 bricks you&#39;ll never use for anything else ever again. The fact that the sticker has stayed on as long as it has is a miracle, and I know for a fact many of my other sets with stickers have not been so lucky nor long lasting. The door sticker looks really cool but again, it&#39;s a sticker so again, it doesn&#39;t last the test of time as well as a printed piece would. The door sticker lists the post office&#39;s hours, a great detail. &quot;9 AM-12 PM / 2 PM-5 PM&quot; listed on it. Gotta love that government-issue two hour lunch break. Considering how convenient the post offices&#39; hours around my area are I&#39;m shocked it isn&#39;t three.</p>

<p>The next design flaw is the roof. Put bluntly, this thing is barely re-enforced at all. The roof is made of 2x3 sloping bricks, most of which are supported on the front two studs on the bottom and the top two studs in the back and nothing else. It&#39;s hard to describe that in words without just seeing it but the set desperately needs some plates stuck to the bottom of the roof bricks for re-enforcement. The roof falls inwards very, very easily and isn&#39;t super easy to get set up when you&#39;re building it in the first place. Shove a 2x6 black plate under the top layer of roof and a 1x8 under the bottom rung and you&#39;ve gone miles to making this building sturdier. I&#39;m sure this is a problem nobody cares about but I&#39;m a sucker for re-enforcement and it really wouldn&#39;t have been hard for TLC to fix and render unnecessary to complain about. This set was made in 1985 and while nobody would disagree with the statement that Lego makes a quality product, the relentless sands of time wear down even the best made toys. Studs simply don&#39;t lock into place as well after 32 years of use and the bricks on the roof lock into place in so few locations (at least on my set) that re-enforcement is necessary to keep the thing from falling apart.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Love the parts on this thing. Printed mail drop box, three printed envelope bricks, a super cool and rare post office minifigure torso, that awesome looking conductor&#39;s hat for the mail clerk, and the cool old-style door bricks that haven&#39;t been in any set in a long time. Also you get a classic red bicycle, the type that every Lego fan on earth wishes was put into more sets more often because they look so good. No complaints on the parts front, just wish the door and sign were printed hence the four.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> Depends what kind of kid/collector you are. If &quot;Lego post office&quot; gets you excited, you&#39;ll love this. If it doesn&#39;t, you won&#39;t. I loved this thing as a kid, helped build authenticity in my model town and didn&#39;t take up a ton of floor space in it. Your results may vary if you&#39;re a kid reading this.</p>

<p>The displayability is super high, however. Tons of poses you can put the two figures in, it blends in great with other Town sets (even Town Jr. sets... Lego did a fantastic job of putting buildings to scale way back when), and it adds that nice &quot;slice of life&quot; aspect to your town that so many Lego sets lack.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Whoa momma this set can get expensive if you want it new. If you don&#39;t care about it being new and don&#39;t mind it being used, it can be found for ten-twenty dollars on Bricklink and it&#39;s charming enough to be worth that despite the low parts count. I wouldn&#39;t pay the sixty plus dollars to get it new, it&#39;s good but not *that* good.</p>

<p>Basically, you already should know if you want this set. It&#39;s a Lego post office, and a good one at that. It&#39;s one of the *only* Lego post offices too, so if you go &quot;I need a post office for my town&quot;, here&#39;s one of your whopping two choices. If you go &quot;that sounds boring, I need the Millennium Falcon&quot;, well, you&#39;re probably right, it would be boring for you.</p>
