So from what i can reconstruct this has been the third Lego Set i ever got. The instruction shows beneath what you can see here, some ideas of what you can build with the parts except the original Model. I remember beeing very eager to rebuild those ideas and having a hard time. I also remember having uncounted hours of playing fun with it.<br>Overall a good childhood memory.<br><br>",TRUE,4,1,3,5,1

Stickers with yellow buttons and light grey belt provide the detail but are easily damaged and worn.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pump Wagon</b></div><div>This is a stage up from the small fire trucks in terms of firefighting. This will probably be a well loved, early set for many. It has great parts, some rather rare now- black hinged eight stud large pieces and excellent use of the earlier parts inventory.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigures are one of the best elements if you loved the early firemen but the fire truck has stabilisers, the 'snorkel' for 'firing water' and has great actions. Other brilliant&nbsp;features include the yellow 'brass' rails, the axe (I think it clips on truck) and the lifter-seat that sits on the back of the fire truck.</div><div><br></div><div>The hinged trailer section provides good movement for the large vehicle to swing around those small streets. The firemen set:</div><div><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6307-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6307-1</a>&nbsp;</div><div>would complement this one really well, providing extra assistance to the equipment and bulking out the crew of just two in this case. Those door symbols may be more stickers though so worth checking out about condition. The playability is really excellent with a an almost top build for what its smaller scale is worth.</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps a personal opinion, but I would genuinely rate this over many fire 'engines' and other fire vehicle variants. It has a great 20th century appeal, yet can fit in to any emergency service or town collection. The uniforms look smart and excellent in black to contrast with the red and yellow, just a shame they were easily damaged stickers. These boys just need a fire hydrant to start pumping and snorkeling H2O at the nearest blaze.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Polished Brass</b></div><div>As one of the best early Fire sets and well worth seeking out or re-creating. Almost one of those few Lego sets that should stand out in a separate category for 'Classic' or be marked with a gold brick.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
