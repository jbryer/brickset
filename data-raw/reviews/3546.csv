Given that dad is a professional helicopter pilot...well...it went with the territory. This set, although simple, was a winner. The box had the usual &quot;serving suggestions&quot; of what other types of helo you could build, but I always ended up melding space Lego with this set and having rocket-powered choppers, ones with exposed cockpits necessitating helmeted spacemen pilots, and ones where sliding rails (smooth face pieces?) deployed moon buggies and the like. The set had characteristics of helicopters released in the _late_ 1980s: the high tailshaft and &quot;clam shell doors&quot; were like a Kawasaki Bk-117, yet the low side railing was like a Vietnam-era B-Model Iroquois gunship...err...Search and Rescue Huey. I had fun adding extra lights (thanks, space Lego) where they should have gone for realism, and I think I had as much fun &quot;losing&quot; the patient out the side as I did rescuing him. Classic set, I think I still have all the parts and the booklet.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is completely old school and is still very nice.... (they don't make helicopters like this any more).

Not that many special parts (non)/minifigs but a must have to complete your collection.
