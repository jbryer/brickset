"folkform","2006-07-16T22:45:24Z","Awesome classic","This set is in my top 3 all time.  The truck seems simple, but has so much going on.  The pic above shows most of the highlights--rotating coupling, trailer stand, opening doors on the compartment, even a wind deflector on the top of the cab!  Also, the cab is on a hinge joint that lifts up, you can barely see the round bulge in the front of the cab.  Still my favorite truck.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The cab design is much better than the Fuel Tanker #6696 released the following year; it even hinges up and forward like a real cab-over truck.  When building from my imagination, the side panels of the trailer made excellent tables for minifigs in a restaurant or living room setting.  The only drawback to this set is the sticker on the  air deflector that spans two 2x2 plates.  A careful operation with an x-acto knife was necessary to allow the pieces to be re-used while still preserving the logo.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mawich","2010-04-28T19:28:55.84Z","Alternate model better??","This set was one of the very few I had as a kid where I preferred an alternative design on the back of the box over the main one.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong...the main model as shown in the picture was very lovely indeed with plenty of features packed into a very compact design. <br><br>However, I couldn't help feeling the truck and trailer as a whole was a little too small (particularly compared with 6367 - Semi Truck).&nbsp; The alternative model was a 6 wheeled non articulated unit which in my opinion was more realistic in a Lego Town context.&nbsp; <br><br>6692 may be dwarfed by 3221, but back in it's day it was one of the largest vehicles on the streets of Classic Town.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
