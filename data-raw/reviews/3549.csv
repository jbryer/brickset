It can only be that blue and white caravan.<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Retro stripey top.</li></ul></div><div>The woman gets that 1980's red and blue striped white top with red arms and red hair while the man's black trousers, red top and black hair are basic but actually look very good.</div><div><br><b>Home Away From Home</b></div><div>Causing a tailback on the 303, these two are up for an all weather adventure, anywhere they can drag their beloved caravan. Its towed by a blue car which is an absolute staple four stud example of a Lego car.</div><div><br></div><div>These cars, at first appearance look mass produced but are actually rather versatile and adaptable. This one has a white stripe via its chassis plate and a white plate roof. Very straight forward blue plates, wheel arches, bricks and doors build the vehicle to its completion with some ease. Lights face straight forward and backward and so how have the designers made this one different? They've put a ball socket on the back for towing, thats what. The front brick immediately rules out any bonnet action but this towing capability is not an all too common vehicle feature on cars.</div><div><br></div><div>The caravan is where the extra fun begins. I'm aware of only two such types in Lego. This one is a slant brick ended wonder-cain but its easy to wax lyrical about it as its the only one from this era. That said, its worth every brick and the build is solid and clever, encompassing early panels to allow minifigures access to a four stud wide environment. The blue and white stripes make a matching colour scheme, while black stabilisers (also used as guns, pistons, levers and many other things) sit at the front with the ball joint both adding some realism and required detail.</div><div><br></div><div>The roof is a hinged plate allowing some reasonable access to the larger space within and this hatch is accompanied by skylight effect clear plates. As there is only room for the man to drive in the car, as far as the box shows, this means wife has to go in the back and... knit? The mugs are an appropriate addition and the whole of these details from car to towing joint, to stabilisers and homely interior make a very enjoyable set indeed. Just one essential is missing that an unwanted sticker may have provided: curtains. Lets hope they find a private spot to pitch up.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Caravanning Club</b></div><div>1984 was another great year during Town's 'golden age' unless I don't know my theme history and its actually 'silver age'?? This set was an example of more imagination fired brick representation at its most charming and interactive. Particularly characterful, its definately recommended. Find this set, build it and keep it.</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,3
