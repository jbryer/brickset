"sijpe","2008-07-13T11:18:50.467Z","Much needed houses for the common people","These houses are extremely small and, judging on the interiors, the first thing I would do is to knock down the inner wall in order to create a house that one could actually live in.

Other than that this is one of the very few house designs that allows you to create a high density residential area for the 'less well to do' inhabitants of your town.

On the up-side this set comes with two(!) white doors with bars, which aren't that common to begin with. Also, this set is the last one to use the red, four stud wide, fence-gate.

"Lion_knight","2019-09-15T16:33:59.387Z","Two houses furnished as a single-family home","<p>This set was part of a Lego / Weetabix offer during 1987 - in order to get this set one had to collect 4 tokens and pay 8.95 <span class=""st"">GBP</span> (which was around $ 15, according to the currency rates from 1987).</p>

<p>The set is one of the more interesting Lego Town sets from the 80s, because building (at least on the outside) represents two connected houses in a row. That was unusual for Lego Town sets from that time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some features of this set are suggesting that this is in fact a single-family home: There are no rooms with duplicate function inside (there is only one kitchen, only one bedroom, etc.; also, there is only one mailbox, one trashcan...).</p>

<p>So, in the end, its up to each owner of this set to decide if two families are living here, or only one.</p>

The houses (2) are built up on a green base plate (always a bonus) and are built in an attractive yellow and white colour scheme with red roof tiles.   The first house has what looks to be a sideboard with lamp on the ground floor, while a simple blue bed occupies the first floor area.   The second house has an ‘L’ shaped kitchen complete with tap, pan and mug.   The upstairs area is an office with desk and chair.   The sloping roof is also decorated with skylights and two chimneys.   The garden area is fronted by a red fence and two gates, the area is decorated with a post box, flowers, a tree, a dustbin and a small patio area complete with parasol.

The other addition is of course the small city car, which is presented in a blue and white colour scheme.   This vehicle seats just one minifig and is decorated with headlights, rear lights, a grill and an opening sunroof.

The two minifigs supplied with the set (male and female) are quite unique, the female wears a red and white tank top, while the male wears grey trousers and what looks to be a jacket with red shirt under, he also wears a baseball cap.

Another great late 80’s set, and it was a pleasure to dig it out from the loft and rebuild it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"holeymoley85","2009-12-06T12:41:22.28Z","good quality afforadable housing!","I never had this set as a kid, my cousin however did. I got given some of his old lego and some instructions to,amongst them was 1484's instructions. i never remember owning a lego house as a kid(except for the basic sets), i was more interested in blowing things up with my spaceships, or running them over with my trains!

What can i say about this set, its a great little house in classic 80's lego style, the houses look good, especially when you build a whole street of them! granted the inside is a little small, but show me a 80's lego house that is'nt.

I'm still not clear as to wether the white capped chap actually lives there or is just dropping off some post?

it gets a 5 due to its easily replicable design.

"PeteM","2017-02-08T14:24:19.673Z","Little Boxes, On The Hillside....","<p>This delightful and surprisingly large set was given away &#39;free&#39; with Weetabix breakfast cereal in the UK, though I seem to remember that my family had to stock up on boxes and boxes of the stuff in order to collect enough tokens in time (and it&#39;s possible my mum is still working her way through the remaining packets some 30 years later). Part of the popular Town line, the set visually ticks a number of the theme&#39;s design cues, but does it have more to offer?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As could be expected for a set of this age and type, it provides an excellent mix of building-specific pieces, such as fence parts, roof slopes, sloped &#39;skylight&#39; windows, train windows, and a couple of barred doors (relatively rare in white), as well as plenty of basic 1xn bricks for the walls. There are also a fair number of decorative pieces included, such as the postbox (and envelope tiles), tree, flowers, and a printed garden umbrella which really help to flesh out the set. The little car makes use of the then-new 1x4 bracket for the front bumper which I remember being an exciting piece at the time, and the inclusion of a green baseplate, even if only 16x32 in size, is always welcome.</p>

<p>As the parts could also be used to build a secondary model of a large creepy Weetabix man, there is a yellow 2x4 brick printed with a smile on one side and a frown on the other, as well couple of 2x2 bricks with eyes. One of these ends up hidden inside the wall of the house, like a nightmarish evil talisman that will one day awake to bring the unsuspecting homeowners under it&#39;s malignant control...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two minifigs included are pure Legoland Town, consisting of a smartly dressed man in a white hat and a lady homeowner with a red stripy top. While the former was unique to this set in that combination, the latter shows up in set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/1896-1/Trauma-Team"">1896</a> five years later, when she appears to have taken a turn for the worse and is being stretchered away.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>This is a set of its time and offers little in the way of surprises or challenges beyond those that are inherent in the style -&nbsp;as the walls initially rise as large &#39;slabs&#39;&nbsp;consisting&nbsp;1x6 bricks placed directly on top of one another without any interlocking, they are a bit prone to falling over under any kind of pressure whilst building. This is rectified somewhat when the first floor provides bracing at the top and the tall sloping roof takes shape around this and gives the structure some stability.</p>

<h3>Completed Model and Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The end result is strangely pleasing - the predominantly red and yellow colour scheme just screams Classic Town and the simple offsetting of the houses depth-wise gives the set much more visual interest than a single house or a simple straight terrace. The usual open backed style allows plenty of room to play and the inclusion of a car means that the play possibilities of the set are opened up beyond the static and provide a link to interact with other sets.</p>

<p>The kindest term for the interior features would be &#39;representative&#39; as they are somewhat lacking in detail and constructed from basic bricks. I&#39;m still not sure even now if the blue construction in one of the upper rooms is a bath or a bed but, this one aside, each room has a clear purpose and provides a more than adequate &#39;jumping off&#39; point for any child with an imagination.</p>

<p>One of the key attributes is that, like the houses it represents, it really lends itself to easy duplication - maybe not exactly the same in terms of colours or contents, but I remember it being the template for many of my own creations at the time and was a great starting point for building a little Lego suburban neighbourhood. There have of course been better houses available in the past 30 years, but this set still has an individuality that really makes it stand out - for anyone wanting a good dose of nostalgia, or simply a model to provide interest in a larger &#39;classic&#39; layout, this set is hard to beat.</p>
