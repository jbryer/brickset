All of the stickers fit on a single brick except for one that spans two flat 1x1's just above the hose holder.  I sliced this small sticker in half with an x-acto knife when the set was new and still have the two 1x1's with the sticker halves on them to this day.  The truck cab in this set is not as nice as the one in #6692, but it's still a very good replica of a tanker truck and certainly a necessary vehicle in any Lego city.  The set also gives you a good number of slanted bricks which are useful in creating interesting architecture in your Lego houses.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;I like that it has actual doors (a rare thing in modern sets) and an opening roof. The hose is a cool feature, along with the fact that the trailer can standalone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I customized mine with some bars, fog lights, and &quot;shocks&quot;, giving it a more aggressive appearance. Most people will probably want to leave it as is, but LEGO is all about switching things around.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this is a great retro set worthy of any collection.&nbsp;</p>
