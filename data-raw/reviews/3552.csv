The helicopter itself is great.  It's a sturdy set with a lot of playability.  I added a rotating spotlight for those night missions that might happen.
However I'm not sure who he reports to.  Is he part of the FD?  Not color schemed for that.  Is he part of the Coast Guard?  He doesn't have the logo or the red, white and blue color scheme there either.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"J_tje","2010-03-11T13:08:08.653Z","Great Prelude to a new (sub) theme","This helicopter is great. Basicly it's great due to it's (simply but on the money) design (Old school), playability (allthough te landing gear keeps on falling off/ it just isn't as studry as the one piece helicopter landing gears).Not that many special parts (except maybe the decals).<br><br>This set is the first out of the Town-Rescue series. (that lego only seems to have re-discovered only 15 years later) A great development of the 1982 Town Medical Chopper. A true Rescue/Sea King Model. A must for all Town/Helicopter collectors!<br>",FALSE,5,3,3,4,5
"Mawich","2010-04-27T21:30:54.06Z","A lego Iroquois","I received this set for my 12 birthday and had many fun hours using it on ""rescue missions"".&nbsp; Modeled on the iroquois helicopter made famous in the Vietnam War, 6697 was a natural successor to 6691 - Red Cross Helicopter which was introduced 5 years earlier.<br><br>It was a fun set to build because it used a lot of pieces that had been introduced only a year earlier such as the rear slopes and the antenna pieces used in the cockpit.&nbsp; The 2nd crewmen could be lowered using the hose reel mechanism more commonly used in Fire Engine sets of that era.<br><br>My only complaint was that the minifig was attached to the rope via a noose round his neck!...meaning you had to remove his head to attach or unattach him...a somewhat ungainly approach for such an important minifig....<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Leeyore","2012-05-13T20:28:40.1Z","Timeless... Perfect level of detail and flexibility","<p>I remember buying this set with my allowance.&nbsp; Some 25+ years later... I found I still had all the pieces.&nbsp; (Or maybe I just had enough from other sets -- though I did find the pieces that had stickers affixed...)<br></p><p><br></p><p>The best thing about this set is that it has plenty of detail without looking too ""finished.""&nbsp; I know different LEGO fans have different expectations for a set, but, for me, this set hits the sweet spot.&nbsp; It's not too detailed (parts that are too specialized to be used easily in other creations) but at the same time it doesn't look clunky or out of place in any setting.</p><p><br></p><p>I like sets like this -- with plenty of pegs still showing -- because it gives more opportunity to customize.&nbsp; Plus, as noted below, the parts from this set can be used in any other number of new creations.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>+ Great bricks that can be used for any number of things -- boats, cranes, planes, etc.</li><li>+ Just the right balance of specialized parts versus more universal parts<br></li><li>+ Clean, detailed look without being over-simplified<br></li><li>+ Still looks good among today's sets (or can easily be made more ""sleek"" with tiles to satisfy other tastes)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons (not much, really)<br></h4>
<ul><li>- Landing gear is prone to come off<br></li><li>- Can you believe the rope has started to fray?&nbsp; I mean, it's only been 25+ years.</li><li>- I never liked the ""smiley face"" minifigs, as classic as they may be.&nbsp; But that's what helmets/visors are for.<br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, a beauty.&nbsp; A great look, fun play and lots of room for creativity.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

Seriously, every time someone complains about how stuff should be less colorfull, they should build this set as part of their punishment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so yellow it&#39;s disguisting, it is one of the sets I put together once, and took imidatley apart, it can&#39;t do much, the yellow everywhere annoys, and then it annoys even more. Why wouldn&#39;t it be white with a red and blue stripe for coastguard? We&#39;ll never know.</p>
