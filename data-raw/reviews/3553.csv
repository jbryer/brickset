"Der_Krake","2008-05-23T04:59:09.293Z","Amazing set","This is one of the best sets ever created by lego. It is a small set, but very playfull. I simply love the details, you can open the hood, the back door and the 2 doors of the RV, it also has a window on the roof, which is something that we now do not see in the new sets. The boat is quite cool and it is impossible not to notice the details of the engine, it looks so &quot;real&quot;. For me it is 1 of the 10 best sets ever created.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hs","2009-08-27T16:30:04.297Z","very good set !","This is set I got for a gift somwhere in early 90's an it's so cool.
SUV, or Jeep whatever, is so cool, nice details, boat is also cool in my opinion (just look the windshield !), and i like that scuba gear ! looks awsome ! maybe little bit vintage nowdays, but hey, set is from '86.

quite playable, lego guy can go to a nature with the SUV, ride a speedboat and go to a diving. cool.

maybe one more lego figure will be cool, but there is no space for it in this set...
also this ordinary styling of a guy is maybe anoying nowdays... just smiling face, just red clothes but... as I said before, it's 1986 set ;)

good value for the money, good compatibility... what else to say, 
99,9% fun !

What I do remember, is that I simply&nbsp;loved playing with it. Plenty of moving parts, opening doors etc. This was years before there were flipper-parts, so using the 1x2 plates for flippers is OG&nbsp;style NPU in my eyes.&nbsp;</p>

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-02T04:08:24.093Z","Sporty and Good-Looking…","I got this set way back in the mid 80’s when it was first released; I absolutely loved it and still do.   The size and scale of the set means that it fits in just about anywhere in a display / layout.   The set includes a blue off-road vehicle, red trailer and speedboat.

The jeep is sporty in appearance and has a marine colour scheme of blue and white.   Large tyres with white wheels, spotlights, an opening bonnet and colour-keyed front bumper complete the look of the jeep.   There is also an opening tailgate in which various pieces of diving equipment, breathing apparatus, helmet, searchlight and flippers can be stored.   Also provided is a small radio aerial on the vehicle’s roof.

The trailer is mainly red with some white detailing.   The trailer features a ‘winch’ assembly at the front as well as securing points for the boat, rear brake lights and folding undercarriage which can keep the trailer level even after the jeep has be detached.   

The speedboat is mainly white and features a blue band, which corresponds to the jeep.   A sports-style windshield is provided to protect the crew from the worst of the elements while a large outboard motor is mounted on the transom.   This can be lifted on a tilt bracket for use in shallow water or for when being transported by road.   The outboard motor also features a realistic propeller and throttle.   

Another great addition to the leisure / marine lines.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years it got modifications; removable tires and then spring loaded shocks, mutiple variations of the ""shell"" and lights, even used the winch from my Kings Castle (6080) to represent the winch on my parents Jeep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was great on this little jewel; rear hatch and roof hatch, hinged hood, boat and trailer.&nbsp; Built it first every time since the build was easy, but still had enough complexity to not feel like it was just ""one more thing.""&nbsp; GREAT GREAT GREAT!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
