The bicycle was one of the coolest lego items; I loved that piece so much!  It's a simple set, really easy to make, and it's definitely a classic.  Overall, a really nice little bike set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

One of the nice things of this set is the preprinted sign(I don't like stickers)
What is missing in the shop is a computer(like in set 6373)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-08T15:36:08.94Z","Cycle Fix-It Shop Review","<p>In many ways, this set due to the yellow bricks has me think of it as a scaled down version of set 6373 Motorcycle Shop. But that's not really true. While similiar, they're very different. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6373 is a Motorcycle Sales place, whereas this set is a place to bring your bicycle or motorcycle in for repairs. It's one of the few rare sets I have that comes with an actual bicycle. You get two motorcycles and two minifigures. There is a small shop to the side of the repair garage and preprinted signs, that is non-stickers that are cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun little shop and adds a lot of great character to any Lego City or Town.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
