<p>However, there are 3 official alternative construction methods, one of which is also a mobile crane.&nbsp;This is already designed to fit the minifigure and is just as good as the main version.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t even understand why it&rsquo;s not on the main cover of the box.&nbsp;And there is instruction sheet for this crane as well.</p>

<p>In addition, we can still build two types of tow truck, both of which are fantastic and unbelievable to be able to build from these few parts. Brilliant!</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure has been given a high visibility vest with a sticker on it.&nbsp;<em>This vest could have been used by the designers in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/575-1/Coast-Guard-Station"" target=""_blank"">575</a> set without a sticker.</em></p>

<p><strong>My Mod</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to modify&nbsp;this crane because it&rsquo;s as good as it is. But, my set is missing the winch, one of the transparent slope&nbsp;bricks, and the black hinged plate.&nbsp;So while I was waiting for my Bricklink order, I tried to replace them with parts that were available in 1978. It worked!&nbsp;Sadly, the&nbsp;black hinges are both rare and expensive.</p>

<p>And once I&rsquo;ve remodeled it, I&rsquo;ve done it to fit the minifigure in the crane&rsquo;s cab.<em>&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s not to scale</em>,<em> but at least the figure fits</em>.&nbsp;Otherwise, the technic parts are from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/850-1/Fork-Lift-Truck"" target=""_blank"">850</a> set.&nbsp;The winch and hinge became integrated using a&nbsp;technic axle.</p>

<p>The technic axle point gets stuck in the bottom of the plate so you can adjust your crane to different heights.</p>
