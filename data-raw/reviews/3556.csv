From 1983 to this year, some pieces are now hard to find, like some accessories, that are for explore the space region. The six minifigures can be classified in three groups of two, because two have the same color. Are they two yellow, two red, and two white. Altough three colors were repeated, they still useful because the minifigures have the same details in the body, and that makes possible make an army with one of those colors or make one with all. The helmets weren't complete, but still cool, because they were used by many themes, like city, racers and castle, as support of many helmets. The minifigures have also different jetpacks, that have their main color. The accessories that were used in sets from the 90's years and still being used few times in recent sets are on this pack, like one piece that can be used as a weapon for astronauts or jetpacks from spaceships. The playability of the set is basically the playability of minifigures and accessories. This small pack deserves a 5/5, in comparison with minifig packs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get 2 yellows, 2 whites, 2 reds, and alt of accessories. Many fans do wish though it had a black space minifig, but it doesn't come with one. This is a very good add-on and should be owned by any Classic Space fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

As different coloured uniforms were released, many collectors were keen to build up their own Astronaut Corps, with the chief astronaut variously denoted by the colour of their uniform. But if you&#39;re after more depth in your rank-and-file corps astronauts, this set was ideal, especially with the accompanying accessories which enabled a range of repairs, soil scanning, and observations to be done.&nbsp;</p>
