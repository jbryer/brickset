It's minifigs","One of the many minifig-kits common in the latter half of the eighties, it consisted of four minifigs, two simple yet functional droids, some general equipment, and most importantly the jetpack, a recent addition appearing with kits that started coming out in 1985/1986.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-05-30T19:36:03.483Z","Useful minifigure pack","This set is basically a minifigure pack, from the space theme, like the others that I reviewed recently. This is one different type of minifigure pack, including four minifigures and two mini robots, builted with imagination and creativity. The minifigures are considered classic, altough other subthemes can be considered as classics too. 

The minifigures have different colors, but still useful due to the details, simple like the design, cool like the original shape of lego. The minifigures have a jetpack for each one, and one jetpack more, putted on a yellow minifigure in the image. This have more additions, like above it or in the front of the body of the minifigure. The two robots don't have two legs, but can moves easily their arms. Including also hard to find tools, useful to many themes, this set, altough without buildings, have useful parts, like the parts from the bigger and from the smaller robot. The classic colors from space are here, black, yellow, blue and red, except white. 

The playability is the same of the other minifigure packs, and these were cooler than some new impulse, altough without spaceships, the set includes more minifigures, tools, cool and different colors, and the shape of the minifigures are the original, and the better. In overall, a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For example there are never enough ships, castles, buildings or vehicles to hold all characters that you own... This set is the exception to such petty quibbling.<br />
<br />
<b>Minifigures </b><br />
Building experience is often a low score or even a let down with many MF dominated sets due to the basic parts and lack of bricks. Here the parts are all excellent including sparkling torso prints and with additional bricks plus a brilliant print, two robots are formed.</p>

Simply, the astronauts themselves, subtle enough for kids to project personal imagination and character on and yet symbolic and uniformed enough to combine throughout many sets. Each colour being collectable in its own way, these designs make unlimited appeal and playability.&nbsp;</span>The gear of course is all interchangeable, the purpose, job or rank of each colour astronaut being anyones guess or choice, white seemed a good choice for captain.<br />
<br />
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; ""><b>Gear</b></span><br />
The equipment includes; a spare grey robot arm/ratchet/tool, a metal detector/mine sweeper/scanner, a scope/laser cannon/bazooka and an incredible jetpack no less! This part has the fantastic detail and locks over the torso. It includes a red light, two boosters and some aerial/antennae. Surprise, surprise, the cb radio returns and very suitable too.<br />
<br />
<b>Retrospective</b><br />
With such lovely parts, almost nothing in the entire Lego range reaches the iconic status&nbsp;held by the 1970s designed astronauts/ spacemen. Some early castle, pirate and town folk such as the baker come close but the basic primary coloured space suited MFs with less print and more cool gain regular positive admiration usually described as &#39;classic&#39;, &#39;retro&#39; and so on. They hold the eye and imagination and the only thing missing from this set was inclusion of the white astronaut to make a &#39;gold brick&#39; set.<br />
<br />
Lets hope the spacemen could return to the hobby in various ways for the future:&nbsp;As purple, pink, orange, grey, green and even brown&nbsp;alternate uniforms? With new a retro subtheme and colour coordinated ships and bases that match the uniform?<br />
The&nbsp;old space badges on modern city MFs jackets indicate the popularity of the theme. Do these badges suggest&nbsp;some kind of early space endeavour? Would&nbsp;a future/cyber city theme create a kind of &#39;prequel&#39; to the inception of the MF Space missions? Who knows.&nbsp;These are forever collectable Lego gold for all ages.</p>

This one, like several other minifigure packs or collections features the Classic Space Minifigures with 4 Minifigures and a slight build for two robots. Usually you get sets like these to fill out a theme or setting and for your own MOCs. This set also has plenty of fun little space themed accessories for the minifigures to be using. I know for myself, one of the reasons I picked it up was to get the blue space minifigure and I've always typically enjoyed picking up sets like this.",FALSE,5,3,1,5,5
