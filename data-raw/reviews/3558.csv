"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-07T11:57:40Z","Great bonus set!","   A great booster set for space, it has four futuron dudes plus the ULTRA rare red futuron spaceman and the the difficult to obtain black futuron spaceman.  Plus it has two blacktron dudes.  But it should have been released in 1989 so then it could have a space policeman, cause without weoponry these guys are doomed.  But still, the red guy could clobber on of the blacktron spacemen with his wrench-thing.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-05-30T19:13:31.28Z","More classic minifigure pack","This set was a minifigure pack of variated minifigures from variated subthemes from space theme. All these can be considerated classic, and altough were from 1988, they still useful, and have also some tools that are hard to find now. 

The colors and details from the minifigures are great, combining in the style, and turning they very useful as army builders, city builders (they can be used as citizens from cities), and to increase action on the bigger sets. They also have different colors that can be considered as hard to find, like the yellow, blue and black, also the red, with completed helmets, combining with the main colors of the minifigures. The tools that are now hard to find are very useful too, with their own style, still useful for city. One of the tools that is common now (or was in the sets from the 90's years) is one that can be used too as jets from spaceships. 

The playability is the same of the other minifigure packs, just minifigures with the original shapes and movements, that can use easily the tools, that increased this set. In comparison with minifigure packs, this is a 5/5 set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-02T15:33:42.06Z","Box Of Jelly Babies","This little lot are from 1988 a year that brought the first releases of the popular Blacktron. Futuron had jumped in the previous year, consigning the classic astronauts to deep space. The Space Police were not yet present so their inclusion was sadly missing in a Minifigure box until 1991, by which time they had otherwise been gone for a year but were added with an old Blacktron MF, no doubt to popular demand.<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Blacktron</b></div><div><p></p><ul><li>Black visor.</li><li>Good tools/weapons.</li></ul><p></p></div><div>Brilliant torsos with white outlined tubes or breathing apparatus and some spacey belt type thing. The all black look was topped off with the genius simplicity of making an all black visor, very sinister and reused to great effect by many for; cool bikers, baddies, disguises, an improvised Batman suit and many sci-fi and action theme film characters. Best part in the set.</div><div><br></div><div>The two Blacktron agents look like they are using the light grey scopes and megaphone as blasters or laser weapons. Meanwhile all the Futuron workers can do is flee with their poxy cb radio to call for help, a mine sweeper for a safe but getaway, a spare wrench or broken robot arm as an improvised weapon and a spanner to swing wildly in panic.</div><div><br></div><div>Come on this is Blacktron! The scary, efficient and very cool looking bad guys. Could Futuron with their amazing looking ships, gear and colours not get any defences? Guess not and so the Space Police were created the next year to rescue the diligent Futuron, allowing work to continue on their mission to... what <i>were</i> they doing?</div><div><br></div><div><b>Futuron</b></div><div><ul><li>One of each colour in good prints.</li><li>Decent tools.</li></ul></div><div>These white and multi coloured jube like space heroes get some neat gear but sadly no robot. Its amusing to see the trusty universal spanner here, suggesting that construction is a strong part of whatever weird engineering they are up to in space. The other previously mentioned bits of kit are suitable but repeated often so the spanner seems surprisingly most welcome.</div><div><br></div><div>The flashy two colour zipper tops with white do not actually appeal to me as much as the preferable retro astronaut plain colour simplicity. The torsos all look very good though and have great prints. Their visors were strangely dark, a lighter or clearer tone may have suited better (I wish they had done chrome). Nonetheless they have to use these quite cool dark visors and the usual oxygen tanks all round. The black Futuron chap provided proof that the old black astronauts did not 'become' Blacktron but were a type of their own and very collectable too.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Space Candy</b></div><div>These designs all work well together and provided massive playability past their brief build. The only reason to mark it down on parts is not because the excellent torsos and visors were yet to be backed up by anything that imaginative or new but for want of a Space Police trooper or a colour variant as seen in the Dacta set. The previous MF space pack was so good that this group don't quite match up but will of course win out as favourites through massive appeal. After all it is the legendary Blacktron and Futuron.&nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,2
