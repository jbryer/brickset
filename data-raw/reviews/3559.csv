"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-30T00:00:00Z","","This is probably the only set where you can get Blacktron 1 and 2 figures together. I wonder what the Blacktron 1 guy would say to the blacktron 2 guys? The Space Police and M-Tron guys are nice to! I have to get one of these!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-09-09T00:00:00Z","","This is the best of the space figure packs. It has six varied guys with visors and some great jetpacks, but what is that wrench thing that one of the MTron guys is carrying? ----- 

The good:
-- has the greatest variety of the figure packs with men from four themes
-- great selection of equipment, including two different jetpacks and a metal detector ----- 

The bad:
-- would have been nice if some extra black airtanks were included for the guys when not wearing the jetpacks, as in 6702",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-07T04:54:04Z","Another good minifigure pack","The good:

-more proof that blacktrons 1&amp;2 can coexist at the same time. and use grey tools without violating official color schemes

-jetpacks, including the relatively rare black Mtron one

-Tools

-Good representative of the good old days.

The bad:

-Only one space policeman... with three blacktrons, he's doomed.

The ugly:

MAN, these things were expensive.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Being a pack, this need be reviewed comparing with packs, understanding that they have minifigures and accessories, don't buildings. But still great, as army builder, city builders, and too builders of action for the other sets, like from the space, with more astronauts. These have the same face, but are great because they have different accessories and colors (some have the same, but still, due to the simple and cool details, and having sometimes repeated parts are great for army builders), like the helmets and pieces on their back that looks like jetpacks altough they have their own differences. The helmets features too glowing parts, like the red and green. Another pieces aren't very common, but are useful as accessories or to increases the sets. Some of those itens are equipments for explore (planets, or what you imagine, like moons, because the owner of the set can make the storyline easily with these creative accessories)and they are very useful for any original lego minifigure, with the original shape or maybe with shape from the star wars' droids. The colors are well printed, and they combines with the details of those astronaut minifigures. The complete set is very playable, to minifigures and equipments, of course, but still with a 5/5, deserved in comparison with minifigure packs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
