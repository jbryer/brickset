"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-13T16:50:04Z","Nice Figures","This set was the cheapest way those times to get the droid and at least ONE single unitron, especially when you live in europe... The thing that kept me away from giving it a 10 was the fact, that i would like to get another 'normal' unitron ( there are only six in all unitron sets together ) to complete the collection of '94 space minifigs. The droid was also very interesting with its clear helmet and the second minifig ever to have printed legs. If there would be a blue ice planet saw holder instead of the black one, this set would be even better, but it's still a good set. Happy to own two of 'em!
( If you look at the '94/'95 UK catalogues, you'll find out, that the ice planet chief is called Commander Bear and the Spyrian Soldier is called Major Kartofsky...) ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Intrigued, I bought it for a low price and was surprised to find minifigures from all these different space themes.

While the set is great for minifigure collectors, it's not good for just about anyone else in my opinion.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-05-31T11:42:59.077Z","Variety of minifigures","This set is like the others that I reviewed recently, and is considered a mini figure pack. It doesn't include many tools like the others packs, but it is still great due to the variety of the types of the mini figures from many sub themes - considered as classics. The set was released in 1994, and includes some other types of pieces that are hard to find now. Like the cool accessories with the explorer from ice planet (the one with orange and white parts, also with details in blue so as to look like with an environment of ice), those accessories that are small ski boards with the translucent orange colors, and with a buzz saw with the same color. Other cool colors that are present in the other explorers are red, blue, and also green.

 Although the mini figures aren't from the same sub theme, they have similarities and it was easy to make an army with them. This is now not the case as they are hard to find. But with the mini figure packs from the classic space theme it is easy to increase cities (they can be used as citizens), or also to increase the action on spaceships or command bases. The playability is the same of other mini figure packs, and the contents, like the different tools, or the plate that can be used as control panels of ships are very useful in any set, although they are few. This in comparison with mini figure packs, can be considered better than the new impulse sets due to the variety.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chemxcore","2009-04-26T16:06:50.45Z","Glory days","To me, this set sums up some of the glory days of LEGO space.  For me, it started with Blacktron 2 & M-Tron, and ended with the Exploriens.  To this day my one Unitron minifig is one of my favorite minifigs ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-04-10T11:58:39.047Z","Space Experiment","<p>So Futuron have come and gone, what could be next? At this stage The Lego Group turned to some strange and bizarre concepts for their heroes and villains of the cosmos, although which were which became increasingly hard to decipher immediately, which&nbsp;is indicative of broad minded storytelling.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ice Planet 2002 have glowing orange slit-visor-aerial combo and multi chainsaw blades and frosty haired face.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&#39;Spyrius&#39; robot features, possibly first proper minifigure robots, featuring; clear transparent helmet, black head with silver tech-print face, torso and legs with a technical gadget type circuit plate.</li>
	<li>Spyrius very colourful uniforms&nbsp;splashed in red, blue and black with luminous yellow visors and silver print circuitry also on a helmet and dodgy facial hair.</li>
	<li>Spyrius heavy laser and&nbsp;blaster.</li>
	<li>Unitron white, grey and yellow trimmed still spacey uniform design.</li>
	<li>Unitron silvery print helmet and excellent eye shades.</li>
</ul>
Unitron don&#39;t manufacture razors or cleaning equipment but look the part with additional yellow trim and helmet. Their&nbsp;laser power drill assists either mining or self defence. He competes with the Spyrius robot for best MF here. &#39;Ice Planet 2002&#39; is now a defunct prophecy if also a fun idea. Some gold tech print and cool blue gloves liven him up. My&nbsp;minifigure head score is a just a bit of fun, balancing a total mark for the entire MF quality within a set so the robot for instance would get a 5 but gaudier MFs brought the mark down a bit.

<div><b>Gizmology Techniwhatsit</b><br />
The helmet prints were an excellent leap forward if a little over the top; there is an awful lot of jiggery-pokery going on here which can cram up the designs a little. The uniforms are clear, strong colour schemes, however gaudy, and the robot is a winner.&nbsp;The background went along the lines of Unitron harmlessly mining for resources (mining -harmless?!) while they got spied on and stolen from by Spyrius. Where the Ice Planet 2002 came in, I&#39;m sorry I do not know but they seemed fierce and not really worth visiting unless you wanted to steal some technology or ask for some ice?&nbsp;Certainly a change of direction for the Space theme then, with some good characters and strong minifigures but also very experimental ones. The more extreme or unique the design of each component, the less it may integrate with other bricks for an alternative&nbsp;design. For example, on what other models are the power chainsaw blades going to look right? Maybe I&#39;m lacking imagination.</div>

<div><b>Results Prove Positive</b><br />
A fun and colourful collection of minifigures with excellent parts and prints for adding to a Space collection but individual taste will judge just how much of the 1990&#39;s &#39;dazzle&#39; your collection requires.&nbsp;</div>
