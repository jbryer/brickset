"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-10T17:42:59Z","Oh! Great set!","This is a great supplement for any western town, it got three soldiers ready to fight for or against you. Be carful, they got guns! I wish there were more &quot;normal&quot; soldiers, not so many officers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-18T17:16:07Z","No Confederates!","  I like the Union army sets but I wish there was a confederate side to make a lego civil war! It obviously is a Union set with the General riding the steed, a sergeant with the bugel, and a regular infantry man with the rifle! I like the way of pointing the sword! 
It is a nice set but I would recommend larger sets!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:35:28.153Z","Three men on Patrol","Western theme is still one of my all time favorite. This set was less than $8.00 US and considering what is in the set it was a bargin. Three cool mini figures, a horse a unique bugle, a flag and a black horse for the General to comand from. Goes great with other western theme sets a 5+ in my mind.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2007-09-23T18:01:27.793Z","good set","This is such a great set to make your frontier army. It comes with a general, horse, and two soldiers. The horn is very cool because it knows when war will strike. A must own for any Lego Western fan. Definitely a 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-24T15:29:36.827Z","This is a patrol, but helps to make an army","This is a small set, without many possibilities of building if you have few sets. This don't helps in buildings because this don't have one. But this is also an army builder, have three minifigures and a horse, without a expensive cost. Some pieces too are useful, like the bugle, flag and the dynamite, to make a lego scenery, and weapons, another thing to armies, like the sword of the pirates and shotguns. The body of the minifigures are blue, liking to each other, liking be repeated, but being again useful to armies. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_in_the_Box","2008-12-20T17:51:44.687Z","No Bad Guys Allowed!","These small sets are fairly decent. If you are building up armies from two set lines, then these are very good. This particular set gives you a horse, colonel, three guns(two rifles and a pistol), a bush, a flag, a horse and saddle, a cutlass, a bugle, two soldiers, and a brick of dynamite(you can never have too many of those). A decent set for a military builder, or if you want ammunition. A good idea is to make a battle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Crazybrick45","2009-06-20T20:13:36.06Z","Great battle pack type set","This is a good set if you need extra soldiers or guns. It comes with a flag, horse, bush, colonel, 2 soldiers, a bugle, stick of dynamite, a pistol, and 2 rifles. This is a very good set if you want to build an army. There should be a set like this except indians.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Darthleapyous","2010-04-30T05:31:19.967Z"," i like those soldiers!","<p>well, im not sure if i have this actual set... but i have all the right pieces (that are all broken apart in my lego box).my sisters had some lego before me and i'm sure they have this set. i think i do have this set! well, enough of all the remembering if i had this buiseness, lets get on with the review!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i like the shiny trumpet piece i think they are&nbsp;rare.i really like the hats also (especially the one with the insignia).the&nbsp;trumpet is nice and the horse is awesome!i dont mind the old dynamite piece in it, because you can&nbsp;connect it on&nbsp;a brick.the rifles are a perfect feature of the set and finally&nbsp;the minifigures,i like them because there blue (on of my favorite colours) and the bandana is cool. overall a great set, if you want get it of ebay (because they dont sell it anymore)</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T17:28:47.233Z","Oh &**$ The Cavalry!","<p>Set #6706 Frontier Patrol: Ah LEGO Western Theme, what's not to love? Cowboys, Indians, Bandits, Black Hats, White Hats, United States Soldiers. And the wonderful new rifles and pistols that were first introduced in this era. (Alongside Adventurers of course.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of those Mini-Figures sets I mentioned in my review of Fright Force, it was fairly inexpensive back in the day and gave you three ranks of soldier, a horse, a fancy chromed bugle piece and guns, lots and lots of guns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't much to say about this set, the Mini-Figures are classic, the printing on their torsos stands out quite nicely in any mixed display of Mini-Figures and on the plus side you have some interesting head-gear for the trio. The leader on the Horse has a nice blue hat with embossed symbol denoting that he is the head honcho.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the box the Bugler is given the blue cowboy style hat while the standard bearer is given the corporal's hat, this of course, like any LEGO set is swapped in the instructions if I recall. (I don't actually have mine anymore, but I always felt that the Corporal would be the bugler.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them is given a rifle, the Captain on horseback is also given a small pistol and 'pirate' sword. There is also the old-school printed plate dynamite. (Wouldn't it be neat if LEGO made a few new Western themed sets with the new Power Miners dynamite piece?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess all I have left to say about this set is, it is definitely worth it to pick it up if you can find it for a good price. It's a cheap way to get some more Frontier Soldiers for your Fort LEGORedo display and you can't go wrong with the Western theme.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4
