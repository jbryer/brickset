"Blade","2007-09-13T23:21:42.187Z","Speed Crocodile","I am sure I got this set as a part of a group with models 6618 and 6619. May have come as a promotional thing with something I really wish I could remember. These were the early Racers as such without the pull back motors.

The model is based around the colour green with a touch of grey. A whole ten pieces plus wheels and fig so 23 all up can't really say much. It has a curved front brick and skinny twin exhausts. Wheels are small at the front and are bigger at the back. Also model is slightly too long.

The mini-fig is green with a crocodile on her race jacket. Her helmet is the traditional one in green with a fluoro yellow visor.

Overall its nothing spectacular but as a team the three look good so this one scraps a 5/10 just for its playability. Ok if u like racers but look good if you are a collector looking for something different as these there are... different.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-20T09:23:18.32Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Green Buggy Review","This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers with this set. The design may be cool but we don't get any play features. I also like the minifig which comes with this model. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
