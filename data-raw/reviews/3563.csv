"Blade","2008-01-18T00:08:07.53Z","Chief Has It All","First again to do this review. This set is good as it is an easy way to get the chief of the Indians and a few accessories as well.

The set comes with a brown horse who is painted in Indian colours. He has a blue saddle and the usual 2 pieces to fill the gap when not being used. It also comes with a green plant which is great if you are building up scenery and a black rattle snake. The accessories include: A black tomahawk and black spear, which both have a pair of feathers clipped to them. It also has an Indian shield with the horse on it. 

The mini-fig is the Chief. He is dressed in red pants and a light brown top, which both have Indian markings. He is wearing the full Indian headdress and has a black quiver of arrows on his back. His face is quite detailed with eyes, noes, eyebrows, wrinkles, mouth and Indian paint.

Overall for such a small set it has quite allot of detail and plenty of accessories. It has great aesthetics but very limited playability even when combined with another set. I feel this set is a 5/10 or average as it looks great but their isn't much to do with and and it is just a small cheepie. Still a good addition for a western collector or a great way to get some western in your collection. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-16T01:58:49.903Z","Running Horse","This is the small native american set and comprises of a minifig on a horse.  That in itself is usually boring, however, quite a lot of attention to detail has been placed into this set.  The horse is brightly painted complete with feathers and isn't the typical plain brown horse.  The minifig is a chief, complete with a colourful headdress of feathers, and a painted face.  His torso and legs are also similarly painted with a lot of attention to detail.  The set comes with a bush and a snake for the background, and a spear, tomahawk and shield for the chief.  The spear has two feathers attached, while the shield is also brightly painted to go along with the chief.  This is a colourful set, but it doesn't seem to simulate play.  However, thanks to the bright colours, this set makes a good display set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

So much small, but due to the size, also cheap, this set have no building features. The design of the minifigures, cheap price (now it is rare) and the color scheme, details and useful pieces, makes this set nice. The minifigure of the indian chief is simple but good designed, have some details printed, other itens like the spear, and it have notable characteristics of a lego classic style minifigure. The horse have the same shape of other lego horses, so, this is not playable. The printed details and color scheme makes this horse awesome. Other itens like the plant, snake and shield makes this small more useful, no much due to few pieces, but this is small and increases well other western sets. Overall, a nice little set, altough the pieces are few and it have no much playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_in_the_Box","2008-05-04T18:10:03.857Z","OK...","This set consists of the Indian Chief, a horse with a saddle, a tomohawk, a shield, a spear, a bush, and a snake. A pretty good set, although if you really want the chief, a better idea would be to opt for the Chief's Tepee, which includes much more. The playability of this set might of been increased by adding another minifig, but it is fine anyway. This set is overall good, 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T17:57:57.843Z","Peace Pipe Optional","<p>Set #6709 Tribal Chief: I would have to say this set is akin to todays Impulse Sets. It offers up a lone Mini-Figure, a horse with Native tribal printing, a few accesories and little else. But it was in a slightly bigger box compared to the modern 4.99 Impulse Price point of today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There really isn't much to say about this set, so I'll just cover the basics. One Indian Chief on the cheap side, a brand new Native tribal version brown with white patches horse, a black snake, a tomahawk and a black spear. (One of the rarer colors for the Lego Spear accessory.) I think for once the big seller of this set isn't the Mini-Figure, he's just a bonus, what you really wanted from this was the horse. (Complete with Blue Saddle)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't be sure if this is a hot ticket item or if you really need to have this set to be a LEGO completist or anything like that. (If you are that type of collector.) But I can safely say that if you were to aquire this set in some kind of lot on E-Bay or something you wouldn't be terribly dissapointed. (The Headdress makes a nice accessory for other Mini-Figures too, Village People anyone?)</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,3
