"shenron","2007-12-28T04:00:40.653Z","In need of enlargement","Compared to other vehicles of the era when minifigures could not get inside, this is definitely quite good. Still, this model has little value in a Legoland town, unless the cabin is seriously modified to accomodate a driver.

The tanker is quite well designed, although definitely undersized, and because of that it would require heavy modifications as well. The gas pump door with small shutters is brilliant, and it is the idea that saves the set.

"peti7788","2021-04-15T14:05:09.66Z","Classic basic awesome truck","<p>I didn&rsquo;t put the stickers on it, I never thought it was a good idea to promote evil oil companies to the kids. Later, Lego realized this and started its own branded oil company called<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6594-1/Gas-Transit"" target=""_blank""> Octan from the 90s.</a>&nbsp;Incidentally, this sett was also released in the US 1 year later as the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/554-1/Fuel-Pumper"" target=""_blank"">554 Fuel Pumper.</a></p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The construction is simple but imaginative, I like the tanker trailer solutions.&nbsp;The fuel hose is just a cord at the end of which a knot needs to be tied and an old kind of 1x1 window piece needs to be threaded through. The hose cannot be screwed on, only the service shutter must be closed.&nbsp;Instead of the fifth wheel, the trailer is fixed with a 2x2 yellow turntable.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Most parts are still available today. What&rsquo;s harder to find are the 1x1 yellow window pieces, the gray fenders, the yellow shutters, 1x4 yellow brick with&nbsp;crome printed headlights, and the metal axle wheels.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifig</strong></h3>

<p>A classic cheerful town figure with a shell branded sticker on his t-shirt. The hat is the same as what cops use, only here red. At that time, fashion was not very much followed at Lego, such hats were last used <a href=""https://youtu.be/WY2w2-CAKgM?t=30"" target=""_blank"">by employees in gas stations in the 1950s.</a></p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the cab section is very basic and there is no room for a minifigure in it. Which I think is a missed option, since a car door already existed, so the minifigure&rsquo;s hand would have fit.&nbsp;This unfortunately reduces playability. :(&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>My Mod</strong></h3>

<p>I think this set could have been done in 1978 so that the minifigure could also get into the vehicle.&nbsp;I took out a couple of 1978 parts and approx. After 15 minutes of brainstorming, the problem was solved. The doors come from<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/621-1/Police-Car"" target=""_blank""> set 621</a>,&nbsp;without a sticker.&nbsp;The cab unit looks a bit like the Renault, MAN, Iveco, and Volvo trucks of the 1970s.&nbsp;I also put 2 brake lights on the rear bumper of the trailer.</p>
