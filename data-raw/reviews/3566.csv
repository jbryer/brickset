To describe it, the first thing to do is regard it as a minifigure pack, only with minifigures and some few other pieces, like tools, jetpacks and the basic helmets.

The four minifigure included are nice additions, and are too simple, altough looks like the same, these astronaut minifigures are good to make an army, and these were released in 1983, there aren't much colors, but the colors were very expressive. Two astronauts are white, and one is a red and the other, yellow. Each minifigure have the same shape (the original and classic Lego shape), and the same jetpack piece, also have the same helmets (incomplete, without the visor, but useful, used in variated themes). Some useful tools are included, like the old space guns, with a good size and easy to a minifigure hang and move.

Overall these minifigures are simple but so much useful, this set was cheap when released but now is so much rare. Altough the pieces came in a different package (displayed), the minifigures weren't builted like the new castle battle packs. So, it gets a 4,8 of 5, in comparison with a minifigure pack from that classic times.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
