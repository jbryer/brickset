BARREL:8/10. Unnsessicary.

BUSH: 8/10. See above.

HORSE: 10/10. Can never have to many o' those around, can ya?

FRIER: 10/10. Use it for a resturaunt.

"Blade","2007-11-05T19:57:49.247Z","Run Bandit Run","The first review was just the worst so here is something that might actually be helpful. This set has allot of bits, pieces and features but no real construction. That doesn't make the set any less playable. It revolves around the idea of a bandit hiding out and the sheriff looking for him.

The baddie is your usual western bandit dressed in all black, with black scarf and a brown cowboy hat. He is armed with a pistol and has a hundred dollar note with him, most likely stolen. 

The bandit's camp has a big brown barrel, which is really nice and he can hide in it quite easily. He has a green shrub which is just another good thing for scenery or for him to hid behind. He also has a small campfire and frying pan, which ups the playability of the set. The other extra for the bandit is a stick of dynamite, practicable and cool.

The sheriff is dressed in black pants, gray shirt and hat, which have the sheriff star on both. He is armed with a pistol, but also has a shotgun clipped to the side of his horse. The horse is black with a brown saddle. 

Overall it's an awesome little set with lots of playability, lots of thought went into what was needed, looks good on display and i feel is worth a 7/10. Lots of accessories two mini-figs and lots of outcomes of how this could go down. A great set for anyone to get especially if you love to play.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-16T08:15:32.983Z","The Sheriff is in town","This is a small set and it includes two minifigs, a horse, a barrel, a grass piece and other smaller pieces, some of which can be used to build a fire on the ground.  It is basically a good guy vs bad guy set.  There's almost no building in this set, most of the pieces are stand-alone.  The only exception is the fire site which is made up of about a dozen pieces.

The minifigs are nicely kitted out with guns and hats, and their torsos are printed with detailed designs.  A skillet is included in this set, and it sits perfectly atop the flame of the site.  There's also a dynamite piece and some cash.

Overall, this set seems to be a cheap minifig set, yet the ideas put into the set to make it more playable deserves commendation.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-25T14:08:46.53Z","Old Western Shootout","Just like in the old westerns, this is an example of a showdown between a good guy(Sheriff), and the bandit(Was his name Black Bart?). Besides the two minifigs, you also get a horse and a barrel that will fit a minifig in. However, it is a little small, but this is good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-14T16:21:48.7Z","Sheriff in pursuit","This small set have so much characteristics of the lego western style. This set includes the minifigure of the sheriff, that is one of the best lego minifigures and also the figure of a bandit. The both have their hats and weapons. The black horse minifigure is also included, and is like all the lego horses currently, with no playability on each paw but with cool and so simple design. The pieces that serve as floor are small but useful, and there is a fire piece and a barrel with a good designed texture in lego style. There is also a plant and a little black pot. The set is basic and cool to play, much easy to build, and this is a small set, one of the first in this theme, so, i rate due to these facts, that the set is is pretty cool, the Sheriff Showdown 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Chaz777","2008-10-11T05:27:44.187Z","Nothing wrong with this, in fact its actually quite good","This was my first western set ever, and actually I got it for my fifth birthday when it was still available, a full 6 years before I bought Gold city junction off eBay.(FYI, I have the complete collection now, thanks a lot, eBay!)
When I got it, I remember playing with it a lot, and now I realise what a clever set lego has released here. its not supposed to be part of a collection, Its more like a cheap starter pack for the western theme, for undecided fans. If it had came out now, I would buy in straight away, to check out the western pieces and decide whether to start collecting. And what a job lego did with it. There is basically no building whatsoever here, just a small 4x4 grey flat piece with two clips and two fire pieces- a simple campfire, purley to add a bit of playability. Other than that you get all the standard western elements- a big barrel, a shrub, 2 revolvers, a rifle, a frying pan, a horse and a $100 bill. The minifigures are common- The Sheriff and 'Black Bart', which is a classic lego trick of using a good guy and a bad guy to add further playability.
But all that just relates to when it was available in shops, not now, and truth be told, this set just is'nt worth hunting down when there are better alternatives",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T17:37:30.017Z","Nah Sheriff I wasn't gonna blow you up.","<p>Set #6712 Sheriff's Showdown: I can't recall the first time I saw this set, but when I did I felt it was a pretty neat seat. I mean it doesn't offer much in the way of construction, a campfire cookout and of course the mini-figures themselves for the first time, but other than that there isn't much else to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does offer a cheap method for obtaining a sheriff and bandit for him to face. Each of them has a pistol and the Sheriff also comes with a rifle, the bandit get's the old plate printed dynamite piece and a 100 LEGO Dollars bill, the neat thing is you can turn his neckerchief around to give him a mask for robbing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The large brown bucket was always a nice piece too, it could be used to store some accessories or a mini-figure can fit inside of it waiting to ambush another mini-figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't call this a Must Own by any stretch of the imagination, but it is fun, it offers a cheap alternative to have a Sherrif and Bandit as stated before and also you get a horse, you can never have too many LEGO horses. (I've got just about enough to make a LEGO Kentucky Derby at this point.)</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,4
"iamcjb","2011-01-16T14:59:44.13Z","Versatile Accessories","<p>I bought this set for about Â£4 in Woolworths, primarily to acquire the guns for my ""City"" police force.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Not much to report here, as it's a stocking filler style set.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As I mentioned, I got this for the guns, which are far better than the lead shot style pirate weapons. I was suprised by what else I acquired. I could easily find uses for many of the items in other sets. Money for my bank and shops in city, dynamite for burglars, a&nbsp;barrel&nbsp;which could be used in ""Castle"", ""Pirates"" or ""City"", flames for cookers, lanterns etc. There was also a horse which I gave to my knights, and a plant which is always useful for decoration on any set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A bandit with a&nbsp;bandanna&nbsp;for disguise, and a sheriff (which I gave yellow hands and a head with sunglasses to make a modern day county sheriff). I then put him in a car I created based on an Orange County, Florida police vehicle. &nbsp;I found the bodies to be well detailed as well.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not much to build here, obviously.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It actually makes a good campsite, and I find it to be better than most stocking filler sized sets. I wouldn't change anything in the set.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A bargain set, which gives a lot of useful&nbsp;accessories, which can be put to good use across several themes. For anyone interested in collecting ""Western"", I'd suggest getting this as an&nbsp;inexpensive&nbsp;way of seeing what the minifigs are all about.</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,3,5
"Stud_Sensei","2021-10-04T10:56:36.31Z","A Great Pastiche of a Spaghetti Western Staple","<p><em>Sheriff&#39;s Showdown.</em>&nbsp;Has a set so small ever so perfectly captured a scene so ubiquitous in&nbsp;the cinematic lexicon of the Western genre? With its spare few elements&nbsp;of scene setting details, this set evokes a sense of place that immediately calls to mind the very films it pastiches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boxart does a lot of this heavy-lifting, as do the additional images all over the box, evoking scenes from classic spaghetti Westerns with some LEGO absurdity for good measure. There isn&#39;t much scope for alt builds, given the limited array of parts, but the diorama potential is certainly there with the few set-dressings available.</p>

<p>The parts are decent; for its size, this set is full of nice character pieces for the figs to interact with. The horse and saddle is a particular standout, as is the 4x4 barrel. However, these aren&#39;t likely to become an integral part of any MOCs you&#39;re planning.</p>

<p>The figs are, ultimately, the real attraction here, and with good reason. They&#39;re great. Rare, detailed torso prints, cowboy hats (one printed!) and really well-matched face prints. The &#39;Outlaw&#39; fig is the better of the two &mdash; the use of the neckerchief as a reversible mask is inspired &mdash; and actually made an appearance in the&nbsp;<em>Train Mystery&nbsp;</em>online game, but the sheriff is a gem too, and packaging the two together is what makes this set as good as it is for the release price.</p>

<p>Therein lies the problem, though. The <i>release&nbsp;</i>price. At present, you&#39;re lucky to find this set for &lt;&pound;10 here in the UK. Like the rest of the Western line, prices have risen an absurd amount. That makes this a tough sell &mdash; for as unique as it is, the elements don&#39;t exactly mesh with anything outside the Western line &mdash; and taken just on objective value, it&#39;s far from the best. Ultimately, then, this set is one for dedicated Western collectors alone.</p>
