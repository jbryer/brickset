"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-28T05:09:28.073Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Grip 'n' Go Challenge Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set has lot's of stuff like 4 torches, a podium where you can slide some numbers in and/or out and two vehicles. The vehicles have a different design but the play feature is the same: The lever on the back is able to slide and you can open and/or close the claw if you want to capture the big ball we get in this set as well. I really can't complain about this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

Its a nice set, i thought it would be just a set and the figs would be cool, but its more...<br><br><b>Building Experience<br><br></b>The build was somewhat hard as the color scheme of both the cars becomes quite confusing. Lucky's green car comes with red transparent pieces while Wrench's red car comes with transparent green pieces. Overall the build was hard itself, although it becomes alot easier when you've built the first car.<br><br><b>Parts<br><br></b>Good parts, some may even be a bit rarish. The figure parts are nice and maybe exclusive to this set. I'm sure ive never seen printed 2x4x1 sloped bricks before - neither did i see a grey ball. Also comes with a red megaphone, score card pieces, red fence, and other cool stuff.<br><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>The set comes with a comic which shows you what to do: drive the car, grab the ball, drive it into the goal, and you win! The first player to get a 9 on his score sign wins the whole game. It's like football but with cars and grabbing arms. A lot of great features, i'd surely rate this high.<br><br><b>Value for Money</b><br><br>30 dollars might be just the right price for this. Great figs, great parts, and a good playability.<br><h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4><p><br></p><p>Nice if you played the Lego Stunt Rally game or just want cool pieces. Its a good set, with a fun game element attached to it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
