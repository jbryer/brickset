"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-17T08:56:44.6Z","LEGO Town (Race) - Speed Dragster Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some very cool blue and white parts which are always great to have for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifig looks very cool as well. I love the printed shark on his torso and the design which LEGO has chosen for the face. The driver also has a blue helmet and black goggles.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very fun and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6714-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The dragster has a very cool design for sure. The engines sviwel and it also has a motor which you can pull back if you want to launch the vehicle. We also get a blue lever which can hold the dragster after you've pulled the motor back. This vehicle rolls very fast as well.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
