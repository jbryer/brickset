Aside from the sticker sheet and white door (L), the parts are quite common. The area behind the caution gate should have a drive-up teller window or the like, but there's nothing there aside from yet another 1 x 4 x 5 window. Some additional details would have been nice! Also, one major thing that was overlooked is the area where the two white doors meet -- when closing the doors, they hinge too far inward, that is, unless you apply a 1 x 2 or 1 x 4 plate to the bottom of the 10 x 10 plate w/o corner that is used as the roof. Again, many things were overlooked in what should have been a critical piece of a classic Lego town scene. Even the smallest town should have a fully-functional bank!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-17T21:17:32.903Z","A poor bank, in every sense of the word","I've been told once: &quot;If you can't say anything nice, you'd better not say it at all&quot;. Measured by that standard I wouldn't reach the minimum required wordcount to post a review for this set.

This set really only resembles a bank because the decals tell us so. There are no -recognizable- money related parts in this set, even though the Pirate-theme was launched a year prior to this set, which means they could (and should) have had some coins lying around somewhere.

In some respects the design of the building is heralding the dark-ages that the lego-town series was about to enter in the nineties: Larger parts lacking versatility, an abundant use of pillars instead of a properly build wall here and there, etc, etc.

It is possible to make a decent bank for your town out of this set, using parts from the 6566 bank. But the fact that it's a dire necessity to alterate this set, seriously stings.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-02-24T20:46:03.34Z","Some interesting ideas, but overall far too simplified.","What a shame it is that Lego town seems to have been short-changed (no pun intended) where banks are concerned.  The 1997 one was terrible, but I was expecting great things from this earlier bank.  The security van is good, and the double-doors with their half-octagon-plate roof are a unique and interesting design.  But apart from that there doesn't seem to be very much.  Apart from the odd bit of detail, this set looks like a precursor of more recent Town buildings.  It consists of little more than full-length windows and pre-fabricated pillars.  This design meant that a lot of later Lego Town buildings looked more or less the same rather than having individual designs and styles.  This might have been worth buying as a curio, but at the kind of prices expected from sellers it's just not worth it.  If you really want it you'd be better off buying the individual pieces from Lego dealers.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-02T18:09:22.717Z","Best Bank Possible!","Why is everyone giving bad reviews? This is a really good set. The bank building is very nice from the top to the bottom. The armored car is also a cool part of this set with yellow pieces for gold. This is a very good set and should be in every single Lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2009-11-27T14:33:38.153Z","Bank Balance & Credit Rating","<p>Many people seem obviously disappointed with this set. Perhaps because they bought it later as a rarity and found it to be reasonably straight forward, true enough. However if like me you spotted it in a shop upon release as &#39;not in the catalogue&#39;, then saved all your pocket money and felt giddy as you purchased the treasure @ &pound;11.50? ...</p>

	<p>Policeman in a non-Police set.</p>

</ul>

<p>That lazy bank manager has the blue shirt under black waistcoat but a tie would have been best. Unless he is the counter clerk and... the red necklaced lady is the manageress being upstairs in the picture? Otherwise she can provide customer service.&nbsp;The policeman or security guard is the standard &#39;cop&#39; but has some nice &#39;gold&#39; bricks to transport and the grey suitcase - thief bait.</p>
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p><b>Brick Deposit Box</b><br />
There ARE small gold pieces for the safes, this is pre-coin and minifigure hard currency! The building is a smart town piece and unusual for its time, acceptably a little bare by current designs. There is only one cashier but plenty of queueing space to frustrate customers.</p>

<p>The security guard/ cop and &#39;armoured&#39; van are a logical addition with a cool little barrier for the unique van to park behind. Not that this will stop any attempted van theft or robbery of the &#39;one alarm&#39; bank for that matter as its the perfect place to stage a bank heist! When not idly lazing around in his office, the happily unaware bank manager is even having to run some gold out in to the street as the silly guard has forgotten it! (see above) Despite the absence of actual minifigure guns in these days, its easy pickings!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Bank In Style</b></p>

<p>The predominantly red bricks are topped by clean white plates that make a smart diagonal corner at on end of the possibly 1930s art deco/modernist bank. It seems a bit period anyway, which is a plus. The yellow barrier makes an area for the security van to park which is neat and the long grey ground plate is pretty generous with space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Glass adorns this red and white building and has rather professional looking white stripes across these panels with the more obvious splat of a money sticker sign so that minifigures can guess what the building could possibly be used for. The thought of using the word &#39;Bank&#39; may come to mind but I prefer the universal approach of a symbol, making it none language specific, unless the stickers were different in each country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flaws include the shelf over the deposit box outside that is strangely not symmetrical across the middle of the main building. That flower pot should be popped onto some corner studs, no problem but lastly I would complain that the internal imagination zone is not the best experienced. Rather any exciting atmosphere comes more from the overall set as a cool looking rarity and interesting inception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Cash In Transit</b></p>

<p>The black security van really is decent. It features; white hubcaps, a black slanted front, high windscreen, high rear lights, a smart badge (sticker), black shutters and a safe within that. As secure as you can get without building a brick lock.</p>

<p><br />
As underground areas are hard to create in Lego without a sculpted layout, a vault is probably off the cards unless its designed at ground level, one day in a future set. A marvellous model to find at the time, you could imagine a new bank set being released as one of the exclusive town modular sets but its not necessary to wait if you want to collect this one as alternative builds are possible here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Sound Investment</b></p>

<p>With a different feel to other shops and buildings through its strange spacious rooms and as the only bank around for years, it is pretty special with loads of scope for interaction, dependant on imagination.</p>

We&#39;ll never know, I put it together from random stuff, because except for the stickers, it doesn&#39;t use any magic elements (and similar&nbsp;stickers were used in another set), and it&#39;s such a great and sensible addition to any 80ies LEGO town. The truck has a great function, the building is substantial. I love it.</p>
