"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-12T01:25:53Z","Another wagon","This is a nice looking wagon with the cloth type cover.  The cannon and brown horse are also interesting features to this set.  I still don't like wagons much, but this is a good set to complement the western theme.  It would have been better in a larger set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-19T13:45:21.187Z","A Good Little Set","I don't remember too much about this set since I built it years and years ago, but it really is fantastic, especially the cloth cover. It's got nice details with the dynamite and the cannon, and the minifgure is really nice. He's the only one of that kind I got, and I really like it. The secret floor (if it's meant to be a secret floor) is also a nice storage place for weapons and such. Great little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-22T06:27:45.403Z","Wild Buckaroo","This is a smallish wagon, but it's one that's nicely done.  It consists of a horse-pulled wagon, with a detachable wheeled cannon attached to the rear of the wagon.  The colour choices for the brown horse and the black wagon contrasts nicely with the white cloth cover.  The cover wich is made out of the stiff cloth that capes are normally made from, gives the caravan a nice set of curves that isn't blocky.  To avoid appearing too plain, the crossed swords in an oval is a nice touch.  The wagon is stiff and nice and doesn't fall apart on play.  The detachable cannon is also a nice touch, but since it doesn't exactly latches to the wagon, it might fall off during play.  The interior of the wagon is wide and spacious, thanks to the cloth cover, and there is enough space for a minifig to lie down inside of with, with a bit more space to spare.  Other nice design touches includes the barrels on the side of the wagons to carry supplies and the inclusion of the whip and the printed dynamite brick increase the play value.  Of course, like all cannons of the era, sets outside North America had a firing cannon which increased play value drastically.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:39:45.34Z","The only Wagon in all of the Western theme sets.","This is one of my favorite sets from the Western theme. Looks great has alot of detail, cloth cover, little barrels, a horse and yes a cannon. Set is very fitting addition to any Western theme set, it is a must have in my opion. When I came across this set I wish I had bought two of them.  Solid 5 !",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-14T13:29:16.45Z","Well made wagon","Released with the western theme, in the year of 1996, this set, named &quot;Covered Wagon&quot;, is nice and features some characteristics from the theme and year, like the brown, white and blue color schemes, a building with simple and useful pieces, like the other sets from the 1990's years. The minifigure included, increased with a small hat, good blue schemes and simple details is cool for any set. And the common lego horse, this in brown color, with few black details and like the other lego horses, don't moves the paws due to the shape, but still useful and nice. The building involved, the wagon, is well made, and use as base some plates, and some pieces with different shape connect these. On the back of the wagon, there is a cart, connected, and with a cannon that really fires (like some cannons from the pirates theme) small balls. The wheels are common, like other from the carts from the castle theme. The base of the wagon, the biggest part of the wagon, have a plate under and four wheels, with the same design of the other two wheels from the small cart, but with different size. Above are some pieces that makes the minifigure sit, and it stay well , on the front of this part of the wagon. Part of this wagon is covered by a piece (a piece with the same material of some big flags from ships of the pirates theme, this also can be used as a big flag for ships), and inside, there is a room to keep some itens, and can also keep minifigures on it. The front of the wagon is connected to a horse, by a plate with a different shape, and it is fixed well, system also used in some other sets from the castle theme. Overall, the building is nice and too the playability, another cool set from the 1990's years.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_in_the_Box","2008-05-04T18:15:39.31Z","Aaah, Stuff it in the Wagon...","This revolves around the idea(In my opinion) That the fellow in the wagon is going to meet his comrade soldiers somewhere else. I absolutely love this, although, if shooting cannons weren't banned in North America, the set wouldv'e been a lot better. If you have more cowboys and soldiers, this set can be more fun. The wagon interior is rather spacious, enough to fit some weapons and other stuff. Overall, awesome set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego_lover2","2009-03-01T11:33:10.59Z","Great set!","I have this set and it is pretty fun. The wagon has alot of room in it for other solgiers or guns or supplies. The solgier is also cool. The cover for the wagon is pretty cool too. If you have any other Solgiers like the one in this set, the set is even more fun! If you see this set for around $12 then I would say to buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-15T12:24:35.127Z","LEGO Western - Covered Wagon Review","Now here we get a nice little set of the LEGO Western theme. It doesn't have much play features but it's a nice little set to have. We get a brown horse which you can attach to the wagon and we get a canon which shoots like a flick-missile. The canvas cover which you can see on the wagon has two swords on each side and this element feels like a piece of cloth material.<br><br>This set includes one cavalry soldier and he comes with a rifle and a whip. On the wagon we can also see a barrel on each side. One of them has a stick of dynamite in the inside. The wagon also comes with a smaller and a bigger wheel and the place where you can store the canon balls can be removed if you want to hide a sword. It's a nice addition to any LEGO Western cavalry army.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

YAH There.","<p>Set #6716 Covered Wagon: I miss the days when you could buy a cheap, well thought out and designed vehicle for your Mini-Figures to use that wasn't Star Wars related. It seems that LEGO Star Wars these days get's a lot more of the attention than something unique and fun like Western, but I can see why too, I mean it's Star Wars in LEGO form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I really just miss the Western Theme in general, I should have tried harder to pick up those LEGO Legends re-releases back in the day. Anyway... On to the set. This little set is really quite ingenious in its construction - you start off with the canon and although it is just a brown version of the same canon you get in every Pirate set, this time the instructions tell you to place it with the symbol printed on it facing down. This makes it look brand new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next we build the wagon, it doesn't use a lot of extraneous or unnecessary pieces, but it still manages to come together quite nicely. The cloth covering piece finishes up the look giving you a really impressive looking vintage 1800's vehicle to place next to your Western town. You also get a few nice accessories, a rifle, a dynamite plate and a 'cutlass' sword which is stashed inside of a nifty looking hide-away place. (Guess the driver uses it if he ever runs out of ammo.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The horse is a brown one this time, which is a nice change from all the black horses used to pull wagons, which seems to be a lot. The Mini-Figure is a nice looking figure, and I can't get enough of those nifty Western hats. My cover for&nbsp;the wagon doesn't hold it's shape anymore due to the number of times I've disassembled and reassembled it for storage and the like, but still it's a fun little set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combined with the other small scaled/priced Western sets even if you don't have the larger sets you can still get a lot of fun out of them, and this one is one of the best from that era as far as money value is concerned. If LEGO was to make this available again in a brand new Western theme I'd have to say the only way to improve upon it might be to change the covering into a soft plastic so it doesn't lose it's form and possibly add one or two more Mini-Figures to the set. If you can pick this one up for a good deal go for it.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
