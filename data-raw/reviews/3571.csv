I didn't think the stream and stuff were all that well designed. Weak sauce to tell you the truth! Terrible ridge, but great minifigs.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:44:00.56Z","Two Indians and a Indian horse - Oh yea","Lots of cool pieces in this set. I like the stump the other guy hides in a plus. Lots of weapons to go around for the two mini figures. All of the Indians in the western theme are done great, good faces with alot of detail and personality. This set was less than $10.00 US when it was available. Great inexpensive set to build up your warrior population, a must if your into Western theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-18T05:56:36.95Z","Bow Wow","Raindance Ridge, or Medicine Spring in the UK, is one of the smaller Indian sets.  The set includes a spring, and Indian on horseback, an Indian, a tree stump, a totom pole and a couple of snakes.

The Indians are very well done, with lots of details on their face, torsos and legs.  They are equipped with interesting weapons, including a tomahawk that has two arrows attached to it and a brightly painted shield.  The horse is also as brightly decorated as the minifig, and has quite a bit of detail on the print as well.

The main set though, is a spring out from a rock, with a ledge at the back to &quot;load&quot; the snakes.  When the ledge is tipped, the snake falls through a hole in the set onto the blue tiles.  This is clever and it seems that a snake is coming out through the spring.  The spring itself though, although functional, suffers from the lack of design, especially next to the brightly painted and decorated minifigs and horse.

The totem pole seems to be an afterthought, and seems built with leftover parts.  The grey bird also seems drab when compared with the minifigs and the horse.  A bit of paint and it could have been a bald-eagle.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This it was my first set from Western Lego and I was playing a lot with it.
There are enough wonderful pieces for any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Batmaniam","2009-02-11T12:38:14.653Z","THE INJUNS ARE COMING!","I got this set a long time ago, it is very cool. It is (sadly) my only Western set. I really wish that I could get some more (maybe on e-bay) This set comes with a very cool Indian horse, with markings, two Indians, and a spring with a totem pole. And presenting for the first time ever: MINIFIGS WITH NOSES! It looks kind of wierd. Spring:very cool, has a litle thing that you flick up, and then the snakes come sliding down. My favourite piece is the stump, it is really cool. It is now in front of one of my lego houses. Overall very good, lots of accesories (bows and arrows, axes, spears etc) if you see it get it. It is a classic. Lego should come out with these again, I would get every single one.

The playbility is not very good. I just bought it because my parents allowed me to choose a small lego set which doesn't cost so much.<br>Overall this set is not good and you sohuld buy it unless you discover it for a low price.<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-12T12:06:39.48Z","LEGO Western - Raindance Ridge Review","This set is one of the small LEGO western sets which are made. If you're looking for some rare pieces I would recommend you to get this set. I also like the printed horse and the rare stump where you can hide a minifig or some weapons in there. I've only seen this piece in this theme. The set is very sturdy and very easy to build. I really enjoy to build this set and there're also no stickers which you've to worry about. We also get a plant, a totem and a dark gray eagle. The two indians are very cool as well. This set doesn't have so many play features but it's a really good set if you're looking for some cool pieces and minifigs for moc's and brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
