*First, it was a good time for the release with the movie.
*Second, it has a BIONICLE type container that has stubs used for a stand.
*Third, the actuwall set is great, it has good color, and is realistic.
*Last but not least, it has four different things it can be made into.

Over all it is a awsome set and is very realestic!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-18T13:16:39.99Z","LEGO Dinosaurs - Brachiosaurus Review","I'm not a big fan of this LEGO Dinosaurs theme. I think it's more geared for the young kids than for the older kids and for the adults. These creatures don't have much play value but you get 4 different dinosaurs in one set which is a good thing about that. This theme is going to teach the young kids more about the dinosaur era as well. The older kids and adults maybe want to use those pices for future MOC's (My own creations) or some brickfilms. The built of all 4 creatures is very quick and easy. I like the printed pieces we get in this set. We get no stickers which makes those pieces unique. I think this is my 4th favourite set of this theme. I don't know why but I think the other 3 sets are much cooler...<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

All I know is I won&#39;t be owning this for long.</p>

<p>Okay so this is a pretty cool set because this species was never made it Lego before or after. I would say it goes for reasonable value in 2021, after all it&#39;s 20 years old. It is quite small for being trying to be a sauropod, but it had to use the same bodies as the other dinos in the theme so it is fine. You get a bunch of awesome parts in this thing. Note, it is the only dino to not come with an exclusive head mould... not counting the 1371 spino attack from studios which had the t rex recoloured from 6720. Anyways the set has good articulation, but the legs can slide off easily. The alternate dinos are cool execpt for the Diplodocus which is very similar. I have to say that overall pretty good set. I think that you should pay no more than 50 for it. After all you get 23 pieces.</p>
