The minifig can&#39;t get in but that never really mattered at the time, with a ladder, an axe and a hose this fire fighter can handle what ever emergency my imagination could come up with. As all sets of it&#39;s time it has a simple build but maintains a level of charm with a&nbsp;couple of interesting parts, locker doors, a tap&nbsp;and a ladder.</p>

<p>A wonderful set for the time.</p>

"peti7788","2022-05-14T19:32:14.907Z","Almost usable fire truck","<p>Again a set that is not minifigure compatible.&nbsp;This is the European version of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/556-1/Emergency-Van"" target=""_blank"">556 set</a>, but it was earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>The firefighter has an ax, and that&#39;s all the equipment.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t look good in the picture, but it&rsquo;s not a printed torso yet, it has a sticker on it.</p>

<p><strong>The vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The vehicle itself is pretty for its age.&nbsp;I don&#39;t understand the ladder at the top.&nbsp;Unusable without turntable.&nbsp;This way you can take a maximum of one cat off a tree. Removing the siren is like a maintenance van.&nbsp;Plus, if you want to get this gray ladder, you&rsquo;ll have a hard time, it&rsquo;s very rare, it was only added to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/374-1/Fire-Station"" target=""_blank"">2 sets</a>.&nbsp;It would have been better for the designer to put a water monitor on top of the vehicle. The play value would have been higher.&nbsp;But it also has a new feature: there is a hose to it.&nbsp;An old style headlight brick was passed through a with a string, a bunch tied at the end and done.&nbsp;Oh and a yellow tap to open the water. Very deluxe.&nbsp;And let&rsquo;s not forget about the trailer, which I think is a water pump or generator, but unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t a firefighter in the &rsquo;70s, so I don&rsquo;t know for sure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>The gaming experience is affected by the fact that it is not possible to put the minifigure in the vehicle. The ladder is just an ornament, a very expensive ornament. And we don&rsquo;t have enough tools to put out the fires. I miss at least one air tank.</p>

<p><strong>My Mod</strong></p>

<p>The goal was to fit minifigure&nbsp;in the truck. Preferably from parts available in 1978.&nbsp;In the late 1970s, the Volvo F Series, Iveco Magirus and Dennis fire trucks were prevalent in Europe.&nbsp;So I tried to build a Volvo / Iveco-like fire truck out of the few available parts that were available at the time. This is the result:</p>

<p>Back then, there was no specific lego fire hose, so I used 2 early technic pints to knit the string in the set, or the rubber tube in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/373-1/Offshore-Rig-with-Fuel-Tanker"" target=""_blank"">373</a> set.&nbsp;I took the idea for the water monitor from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/316-1/Fire-Fighting-Launch"" target=""_blank"">316</a> set, I just put 2 yellow cylinder pieces and 1x1 gray plate&nbsp;in the old technic connector. And then I put an extra steering wheel back, which represents the valve.</p>

<p>I put the gray doors to the side so there is a lockable storage space for the fire ax.</p>

<p>I used two 1x1 transparent plates as a rear light. I pressed these into two technic bricks. At the time, the transparent 1x1 plate wasn&rsquo;t blue yet, though it would look better, but I wanted it to be age-appropriate. So the vehicle has 5 extras: it fits in the minifigure, can be used to extinguish a fire with a hose or monitor, storage space for the equipment, and a rotating valve.</p>
