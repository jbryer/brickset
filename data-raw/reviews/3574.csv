"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-31T03:36:15Z","Incredibly fun and cute!","I was almost obsessed with this line when I was eight, and this set was the ultimatum. Though very, very simple, I found it fun and cute. The print detailing was excellent. However, some paleontoligical accuracy was forsaked for the &quot;transforming&quot;. I must admit, the transformations were a tad lame. The plastic storage box was cool, however, and so is most of this set. Great for little, dino-manic kids.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jon_Brick","2008-04-05T18:38:22.56Z","Awesome transforming ability.","Like Jedd the Jedi I was totally obsessed with the dinosaur theme when I was eight,  so I was extremely happy when my mom got this for me (I was already happy because I was at the lego factory outlet near my uncle's house and yes it was totally awesome ). There's not much to say about this set  except that you get four dinosaurs in one set and that's pretty awesome (my lego city suffered multiple attacks over the next year).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-11-11T12:47:55.327Z","Cool","I got two of this set many year ago. I liked transforming the dinosaurs and having one attack the other. This includes a good number of pieces for transformation and you can take said pieces and make your own creations. (Easier when you have multiples like myself.) This theme was fun and provided a good lead-in for Dino Attack/2010 depending on where you are. (I never had any sets, but my friend did.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-18T13:25:00.43Z","LEGO Dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus Rex Review","This creature is my second favourite set of the LEGO Dinosaurs theme. Even if I'm not a big fan of this theme I think it's looking cool. For some reason LEGO gave this dinosaur a blue color. There're no stickers included in this set which makes the pieces more valuable. You can build 4 different creatures out of this set. I still think this theme is more a theme for the younger kids than for the older kids and the adults. But the pieces might still be useful for some future MOC's (My Own Creations) and for some brickfilms. If you want to get a set of this LEGO Dinoasaurs theme I would recommend you to pick this one up. I think you should get some other sets you like first before you get the other 3 dinosaurs...<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Mike_o_saurus","2011-02-01T22:14:00.97Z","T. Rex on trial","<p>Greetings! Today we'll be taking a look at TLC's second attempt at translating the king of the dinosaurs into plastic. Released in 2001, 6720 Tyrannosaurus rex was part of the first and only wave of the Dinosaurs line. Follow along as I examine this ancient beast from head to tail, and find out if it deserves the title of tyrant lizard king!</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Like all figures in this line, this set comes in a black, fairly Bionicle-ish canister. As a neat bonus, the top doubles as a stand where you can pose the completed T.rex. You also get a fold-out play mat of a prehistoric landscape with a few logs and three-toed footprints sprinkled liberally.</p><p>The instructions are certainly straight forward, but the build is so easy you almost don't need them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There aren't a lot of useful pieces here for anything but dinosaurs. You get extra pieces for making the other three dinosaurs: Ouranosaurus, Spinosaurus and Parasaurolophus, 23 pieces in total. The main idea of this line was dino figures with parts that you could mix and match, each set including enough pieces to build three other dinosaurs from the cover model. </p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Fairly simple, even those new to Lego shouldn't have problems with it. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is were things start to go downhill. First of all, it looks very weird. It doesn't seem to fit in with other Lego animals. The head has two conspicuous holes in the back, and there isn't much of a neck to be seen. The most noticeable flaw is definitely the leg piece, the mold is very rigid and unnatural even compared to the legs of the classic Lego horse, which do not move at all. Worst of all; both<em> </em>of the legs are <em>one piece. </em>They look ridiculous- when viewed from the front they give the impression your Tyrannosaur is wearing pants.</p><p>This piece was okay for four-legged animals, but on any biped it just doesn't look right. Also, since the body fits into this leg-waist-thing loosely (no Technic pins or connectors-it just snaps into place) if you rear it up too far when posing it, the legs pop out. </p><p>The colors aren't very appealing to the eye either. The designers probably wanted to break the old  ""all T.rexes are green"" stereotype, but the sand blue and gray just looks strange.</p><p>On the positive side, it's a very poseable figure. You can move the head and body up and down, and of course this T.rex is fully capable of munching minifigs!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Altogether, this is just a weird model. The alternate builds don't look much better; they're essentially the same figure with one or two parts removed. Apparently TLC thought that if you slap a sail on a T.rex, you get a Spinosaurus. This is the main problem with the entire theme. Since all the parts are designed to be interchangeable and universal, no part really looks right on a single figure. In other words, these pieces do many jobs, but none of them well.</p><p>The bright side here is that this model is fun to pose, and is on a better scale to minifigs than the dinos from the adventurers line. Kids will definitely love it, and it makes a great gift for someone who just wants a Lego dinosaur, but other than that I find it hard to recommend this to the adult collector.</p><p><br/></p>",TRUE,2,1,2,4,3

<p>Parts the parts are decent especially the head</p>

<p>Dinosaurs there very very nice&nbsp;thers&nbsp;the&nbsp;t-rex&nbsp;the&nbsp;spinosaurus&nbsp;and those 2 others my&nbsp;fav&nbsp;is&nbsp;probaly&nbsp;spino</p>
