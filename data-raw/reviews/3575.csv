this particular set is more like an action figure dinosaur toy, than lego, but a great action figure dinosaur toy it is! it's a mosasaurus, but you can build an iguanodon, a postosuchus and a dimetrodon out of it! (one at the time of course) it doesn't require a total rebuild, it's just some taking-apart and swooshing around since all four beasts feature the same body and you're basically replacing head, limbs and tail. out of all four models, i like the dimetrodon the most and the iguanodon the least. the iguanodon is somewhat boring with it's small head as opposed to the giant massive jaws the other three models come with. i like the flipper pieces of the mosasaurus, but the hind legs the other three sport can be used in most situations with other figs and models, since the mosasaurus is a waterreptile and therefor not quite usable for any land-based story (unless you imagine the mosasarus to be a flying creature)
the postosuchus and the dimetrodon aren't really that different from each other. the dimetrodon sports a longer tail and a way cool fin on his back, while the postosuchus has some really stout looking feet, with claws (also used by the iguanodon)
the fin-piece totally rocks and makes the dimetrodon a very cool-looking, menacing monster.
combined with minifigs, there are a number of great things you can do with this beast.
a minifig can fit inside the mouth of the large head! and with the back fin removed, a fig can ride the creature as if it's a beast of burden!
the paint used for the mosasaurus is totally great, with a skull-like pattern on it's forehead and a mix-match of mosaic-like spots and lines around his body, it's decently articulated too, with articulation at the jaws (the big head, the small one is a solid piece) neck, shoulders, hips and two points at the tail.
the fact the mouth of the big head in this set can close, while the mouth of t-rex and co in the other dinosaur set can't close, was one of the reasons for me to buy this set. now i wish i picked the others up as well back then, since they're sould-out now :(
but still, this is a flawless action fig dino, that you can morph using the extra head, tail and limbs to create you're own kind of monster, highly recommended, if you can still find it...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-19T11:17:00.413Z","LEGO Dinosaurs - Mosasaurus Review","This set is my favourite set of the LEGO Dinosaurs theme. Even if this theme isn't my favourite I think it looks very cool and I also think that this is a set you should try to get if you plan to get one LEGO dinosaurs set. We get no stickers which is really good but we don't get much play features in here. Even if we don't get that many features I still love the blue color on that creature. This fish looks very scary but it's a good set. I still think that the LEGO Dinosaurs theme is more a theme for the younger kids than for the older kids and for the adults. Even if you're not that much into these sets you should buy this dinosaur. The pieces can be very useful for some future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Classic_Brick_Studios","2021-06-11T11:16:57.95Z","Everything in here is long dead...","<p><em>Living in the cretaceous period, 83 to 66 million years ago, the mighty Mosasaur was an aquatic reptile, that actually isn&#39;t part of the Dinosaur family. However nonetheless it is a fascinating creature and one among the biggest predators of all time. It is believed to have lived in the Atlantic Ocean spanning territories from European to American coasts. Fossils were found though all around the world, even in the Antarctic...</em></p>

<p>Now given that back in the early 2000s basically every child on earth was a massive Dinosaur fan due to films like &ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo;, but also documentary style of series like &ldquo;Prehistoric Park&rdquo; and of course the beloved &ldquo;Walking with Dinosaurs&rdquo;. So it seemed only logical for LEGO to release a theme centered around those creatures of the long gone era, which is exactly what they did in 2000 with the Adventurers Subtheme Dino Island. However, those first Dinosaurs, while pretty decent, were soon to be overhauled and so, only one year later, with Dino Island Sets still on store shelves, the Dinosaur Theme released. For the first (and to date last) time, we could buy a Dinosaur on its own and let me tell you, these were revolutionary for their time.</p>

<p>So let us explore, what made these guys so special...</p>

<p><strong>The Mosasaur</strong></p>

<p>Now this may not be the most accurate representation of the animal, it still was more than good enough for me as a kid and I actually found it to be kinda scary looking. (being 3 years old at the time)</p>

<p>The model itself has good articulation and the mighty jaws can open wider than what&#39;s looking comfortable on the animal. :-D</p>

<p>I remember having much fun with this not-dinosaur, and it took part in many adventures of Johnny Thunder. You see with having the Dino Island sets still available at the time was a blessing, because you could use these action-figure-like Dinosaurs from 2001 to expand your Dino-fauna, which is precisely what I did.</p>

<p>The printing on this reptile is top-notch and really really detailed. This is also why I decided to give 5 stars in the parts&#39; category, even though you may find these pieces hard to use for anything but a dinosaur. Also, it should not go unnoticed that the set included some spare pieces to rebuild it into some alternate dinosaurs and prehistoric animals, such as Dimetrodon and Iguanodon.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>For some reason this set in particular is pretty low rated for how much fun it was back in the day at a lower price point. Even though Dinosaurs of today look way more accurate (though still not 100%), I think there is just something about the simpler more blocky look to the 2001 Dinosaur theme, that make them a bit more charming. They look like LEGO toys.</p>

<p>So would I recomment you to get this set? Well, yes and no. You see, since these animals can nowadays be had at around 30 dollars, I don&#39;t think they are quite as good of a deal any more than they were for 8-10 when they released. At that price, you&#39;re gonna get some really detailed Dinosaurs from other companies like Papo. However, for their time, these sets were outstanding, and I remember looking through the catalog thinking about how cool these were.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for now, I hope you enjoyed this review. :-)</p>
