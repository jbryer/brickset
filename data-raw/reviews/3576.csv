"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-19T11:23:16.7Z","LEGO Dinosaurs - Styracosaurus Review","This is my 3rd favourite set of the LEGO Dinosaurs theme. It doesn't have any stickers which means that these bricks which we get in this set are valuable. We don't get many play features but we're able to build 3 more dinosaurs with the pieces of this model. I like the design which LEGO has given this creature. The LEGO Dinosaurs theme is not a theme for the older kids and for the adult. It's more something which the younger kids will enjoy more. But the pieces we get here can be helpful for the older kids and for the adults for some future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure...<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
