"hustla187","2008-09-26T22:42:34.107Z","Nice Set","For 1978, this was a good set. A few years later, more pieces were added to make this improvement. The motorbike does look too flat to be one. The rally car is cool with the two tone color. This is good for a 1970s set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"wouterdb","2009-08-09T15:16:33.873Z","Nice","This was one of my first lego sets. The race car is awesome, it was even my most favourite car for years.  I didn't remember the motor bike, so I guess I didn't like it a lot.  One or two years after this set, there were much better motor bikes. But the race car is still very cool. Very nice for a 70's set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>I have no idea what&#39;s going on here.&nbsp;Apparently they are changing tires.&nbsp;The guy is obviously a mechanic, not the driver of a rally car. But then where is the driver? And why is there a cop there?&nbsp;Maybe the car is forbidden to park there?&nbsp;And there is a parking sign. Poor guy can have a spine fracture from this job, his hips are turned away.&nbsp;<em>But maybe it&rsquo;s just me thinking too&nbsp;about it, adults overcomplicating everything.</em></p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>We have a first generation cop who doesn&#39;t even have a leather jacket printed on it, but a sticker instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another car mechanic in a red cap and blue overalls. There is no sticker or print on it.</p>

<p><strong>Rally car</strong></p>

<p>Mini Wheel style car,&nbsp;it was a good idea to put the yellow fog lights on the gray fence element.</p>

<p>Also a good idea is the roof rack and the spare wheel, which is attached to the roof with a gray technic connector.&nbsp;I have used this building technique in many places, such as the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/603-1/Motorbike"" target=""_blank"">603 motorcycle.</a>&nbsp;There are a couple more shell and number stickers on the side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to put a minifigure in the car. If you are creative enough and have a few extra parts, the problem can be solved.</p>

<p><strong>Police bike</strong></p>

<p>Exactly the same as in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/644-2/Police-Mobile-Patrol"" target=""_blank"">644 set</a>.&nbsp;(<em>here is an extra headlight sticker</em>) And I have exactly the same problem with it.&nbsp;It easily&nbsp;overturns, the minifigure sits high on it, and doesn&rsquo;t reach the handlebars.&nbsp;I solved that in that review.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to repeat myself, I need something different here.&nbsp;Police tirke bikes were quite common between the 1940s and 1970s, especially in the US and Europe.&nbsp;So I made one of the parts available at the time.</p>
