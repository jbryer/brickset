"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-21T00:00:00Z","","After I got both LEGO Island games, I really needed a Pepper. Well, TLC came out with these horribly bad-deal, good minifgure stunt sets. Pepper is a pretty good minifig, and adding a skateboarder to your town is a good idea, so I recommend this set for a reasonable price to Town collectors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-17T14:27:59.373Z","Enjoyed This One","I remember getting this in the mail and it looked very good. I liked the little ramp which was very cool. The skateboard was very cool and and made this set fun to play. Also, you get Pepper and this set is perfect and has no flaws.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-16T19:28:47.75Z","Small","This set comes with Pepper, skateboard, ramp, railing, and stick that allows you to attach to Pepper to perform whatever trick he wants. I mean, make him launch off the ramp and into outer space! The possibilites are endless. Overall nice little set, endless fun and excitement.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CrzyLCF","2009-06-29T20:15:23.153Z","It's Pepper-Tastic!","For a really small set, there is no way to explain it as simply stunning. This set comes with Pepper who is really well designed with drenched red hair and pizza imprinted on his legs and torso. He also has a light gray stick attached to his back which is meant to be used for doing numerous stunts off the dark gray ramp on his slick yellow skateboard. I have no complaints whatsoever about this set as it is just Pepper-Tastic! Get it if you can because you won't regret it one bit!",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5
