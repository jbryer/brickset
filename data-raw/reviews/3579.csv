"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-23T00:00:00Z","","I only got this for the Brickster. The motor-trike is even more juniorized than before. The back wheels are one piece, and thats all that's changed, but still, what happened to motorcycles? (They're a few pieces also, but they look better.) Get it for the Brickster, and two flames if you need them, and if your desperate, use the trike.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:47:31.433Z","Brickster is always up to no good in my LEGO City","Very small cheap LEGO set but has one big plus on its side - Brickster and a trike. Brickster is escaped and must be brought to justice. He can easily avoid the police on the off road trike. If you do not have a trike or are short of bad guys in your Town this litte set will solve those problems.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shima55","2008-02-29T20:15:20.7Z","The most dangerous man on the island","The Brickster, widely available as a Minifigure for the first time in this theme, has changed somewhat from his original appearance, but still looks similar to himself in the original classic, LEGO Island.

Pros:
Easy way to get The Brickster
Accurate to his video game form
Jail uniform
Includes flame pieces

Cons:
Trike, instead of motorcycle

Overall, an easy way to get the most wanted man on LEGO Island, or just to get a spare jail uniform for your city.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-16T19:35:31.983Z","He is a bad man","This set includes brickster, trike, and 2 flames. The trike can become a great getaway vehicle for, say, stealing money from a bank, or it can be armed with a machine gun or bazooka, using the 2x2 studs on the back. The best part about this set is the back wheels are plastic. Very small and cheap, if you want a getaway trike in your city and nothing else, this is the perfect set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
