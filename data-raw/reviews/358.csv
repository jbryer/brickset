"Novelty","2007-04-17T07:51:49.71Z","Slot Machine","This set probably deserves a better rating if it got embellished a little bit more, but the current look is rather drab for a Lego set of its era.  It does have a lot going for it though - 6 missiles and two catapaults in such a small set is a good combination.  Although the catapaults work great, it's a bit hard launching the payload as the end where it has to be pushed down is a wee bit tiny.  There are two soldiers to help launch those missiles and the catapault can be rotated 360 degrees, which is good.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-22T18:02:54.997Z","The black knights' dual defender","This set is a small set of the castle theme and the Black knights subtheme. Like some of the black knights sets, this have a classic lego castle style, and was released in 1992. This set have no much pieces, but all the pieces are really useful. The two minifigures included are black knights, simple designed and also awesome. Their little shields, helmets and swords are also used in some other sets. The building of this dusl defender, a little double catapult, is cool, easy but it is not boring. The dual defender works very well and use some pieces as stones, that are a nice option to launch. The dual defender is above the small plate, that is a complement of the set. All the pieces are useful and the playability is basic of a little catapult from the classic castle sets. All works well and overall the set is cool. So, i rate the &quot;Dual Defender&quot; 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-20T12:41:00.627Z","Yet more catapults","<p>There's days, it seems that all LEGO can do for the Castle them is castles, towers, more castles, towers.... catapults, wagons and yet more of the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason I got this was again, wanting to collect up all of the Lego sets I could at the time and for the minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pieces used for the ""arm"" of the catapult make it feel like it's incomplete. For a stationary 'pult, you can rotate it to face another direction, so that's not so bad. And it include plenty of ammo to launch at an invading army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's about all that can be said for a lack luster set with little going for it and a standard model of yet another catapult.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"Cult_Of_Skaro","2016-12-17T05:15:09.87Z","Weird little set, but cool.","<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>One of the few themes that has, in my opinion, improved very little over the years is Castle. The 1980-90s&nbsp;Castle sets have a sort of charming realism that I do not believe has been recreated since. And even when they are not particularly realistic, as this set is not, they still maintain that charming quality.</p>

<h2>The parts</h2>

<p>Nothing special. There are a few good finger-hinge pieces, two spears, and two swords. The only really interesting parts are the two shields with Black Dragon insignias on them. These look lovely and still hold up 20&nbsp;years later.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>The minifigures, as is typical of this era, are delightful in their simplicity. They both sport chainmail, just like their other Black Dragon brethren, and wear Dark Grey helmets. They are also both smiling; there&#39;s no reason to let lobbing chunks of stone at people&#39;s heads get you down!</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The set is quite small, and accordingly the build is not too interesting. That is not to say that it is bad, but merely that it is simple.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This is a really fun set, albeit based on nothing I&#39;ve ever seen historically, and as it was originally a polybag, I have no doubt it would&#39;ve been worth every penny back in 1992. It includes 48 pieces, and two minifigures making it, if nothing else, an excellent army building pack. However, it is no longer 1992, and the current market price is $15 at the cheapest for a used copy, with the cheapest new option coming in at a whopping $50. It is not worth either of those prices. If you are going to overpay for a black monarch set, I would suggest overpaying for the much nicer Black Monarch&#39;s Castle.</p>

"Heisenberg","2018-09-27T20:47:54.993Z","Missed in Europe. Great set.","<p>The Black Knights: a favourite of 6yr old me and still is.&nbsp; A small theme I thought, until I discovered Brickset and opened my eyes to all these US only sets. I felt like a boy again wanting something I&#39;d seen in a Lego catalogue, but not finding it in the shops.</p>

<p>Have searched out Duel Defender for years with no joy. Well last week I decided to bricklink the pieces.&nbsp; Now I have it, was it worth the wait?</p>

<h3><strong>The Build and Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Really straight forward build as it was a polybag.&nbsp; Takes only a minute or two. At the time the turntable piece was quite new but nothing particularly rare with the parts.</p>

<h3><strong>The Mini Figures</strong></h3>

<p>All blue with gray helmets, with the typical chain mail torso.&nbsp; Visually different to the other figures in the theme. Perhaps this is the uniform for the artillery unit.&nbsp; Armed with sword, shield and smiley face they are well prepared for battle.</p>

<h3><strong>The Completed Model and Playability</strong></h3>

<p>Its not a realistic catapult but that&#39;s not the point of this model.&nbsp; This is designed for play and with the tap of a finger your can lob a round brick halfway down the table and a second one straight after.</p>

<p>Combine this with your other castle sets and great fun to be had lobbing bricks at the Lion knights or Black Falcon&#39;s.&nbsp; As it&#39;s on a turntable you can attack them from all angles.&nbsp; Simple but clever design.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall</strong></h3>

<p>Good looking set and great fun to be had.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure it would have been a hit in Europe if released.&nbsp; Top marks from me and proud to have it in my collection.&nbsp; Will certainly be hunting out more of these US exclusives.</p>
