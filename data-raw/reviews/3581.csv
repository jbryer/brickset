"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-26T12:56:32.74Z","LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts - Beach Cruisers Review","When I bought this set in a store I was very excited because this set is my first and only LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts set which I've picked up. If you compare it to the LEGO Town (Extreme Team) set 6572 (Wind Runners) you'll notice that the LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts version is much longer than the older version. The minifigs are very cool. We get Pepper Roni who is the main character in the videogames. The other one is Snap Lockitt who comes with a cool shirt and nice shades on his face. If you build a LEGO agent minifig you can use the face for this minifig for sure.<br><br>This set also comes with a skateboard. For my surprise the skateboard is the only part which has a sticker. And you also get two different variations of stickers for the skateboard but I don't think that a second sticker for the skateboard isn't really necessary. What I like about this set is the cool combination with the orange, yellow and black pieces. The vehicle is very easy to build and very sturdy, too. And if you're a fan of the LEGO Island videogames you should get this set for sure. It's a little bit sad that LEGO didn't make some minifigs, buildings and vehicles of the first two videogames which would have been very awsome of course.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
