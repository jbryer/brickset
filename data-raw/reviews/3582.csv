"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T21:10:51Z","Come fly with me","This set is quite good. The part I like best is the flexible pipe on the hand glider. The hinges on the plane come in useful for doors. Lots of the pieces are decorated (though thatâ€™s only useful if you want to make something Brickster). This set is also a heap of fun if you have Pepper to chase the Brickster (well why would Snap be chacing the Brickster anyway?). The only catch is that you get another Snap who is in just about all the small sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:51:25.013Z","Cool plane and a Hang glider - 007 look out","I have a few of the Island Xtreme Stunts sets and they were done very tastefully. Classic plane with good detail, hang glider can easily come apart if handled to rough. Get the main bad guy Brickster and another good guy in the set. Good set - fun.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BrikmanMcStudz","2009-03-20T14:12:59.14Z","My first System Set","When I was forced into shopping with my mom, we went into a toy store in a mall (It's gone now.) I've played LEGO Island 2, so when i saw this Island Xtreme Stunts set with the Brickster and Snap Lockitt, classic LEGO Island characters, I asked my mom for this set and i got it!

Pros:
The Brickster
Snap Lockitt
Chrome pieces on the plane
Hang Glider
Air Plane
playability

Cons:
Hang Glider broke easily

I'd pick this up if I was you!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It has alot of nice pieces for MOCs.<br/><br/>pros:<br/>-pieces<br/>-cool plane<br/>-the wings on the plane move<br/>-nice little hang glider<br/><br/>cons:<br/>-landing gear on plane falls off alot<br/>-the tube/pipe piece that Snap holds onto falls off sometimes<br/>-not the best minifig selection<br/><br/>Overall, good but not great. Buy for the parts or the plane.",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-20T06:12:05.86Z","Nice plane and glider","This is awesome.  It has a great open top plane and an awesome hang glioder.  The minifigs are great.  It has a surfer like guy and a prisoner with an extremely evil face.  Overall this set is just as good as the other island stunt sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T14:24:34.383Z","Stop the Brickster","<p>Set #6735 Air Chase: This was the second Island Xtreme Stunts set I had prior to the Purge, due to spaceing issues I chose to let it go rather than keep it and I haven't regretted that decision yet. But this is still a really good set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pontoon plane is the primary model of this set and it has a lot of nice features. Aesthetically it looks very good, the special printed pieces of the plane look nice and the feature of the wings makes for a unique looking plane when landed. You can sweep them back on hinged plates in order to make the wings flush with the body, excellent for displays when you want to clear out some clutter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brickster pilots the plane and as Mini-Figures go he's great. He was the only Mini-Figure I ever owned with that black tuque piece. And his face print looks criminal like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secondary part of this model is the small engine propelled glider. Built with unique colored orange and red plates and including a printed Island Xtreme Stunts logo, the glider was fun, but not a very practical vehicle to use to take on the Brickster's plane in a aerial battle. I believe the Mini-Figure's name is Snap Lockit, I have him with my other set too and he's ok, he looks like he's on some tropical island with yellow arms and legs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is a good set from this Theme and if you want to own the Brickster without paying for the more expensive sets then this is a great set to pick up. The plane however does have one minor problem, the landing gear has a tendancy to fall off during extreme levels of play, sometimes it would even fall off when I just picked the plane up. But if you change it up a bit with some spare pieces I bet you could make it more solid and less prone to disassembling.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
