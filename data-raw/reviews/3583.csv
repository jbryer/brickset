"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T21:09:11Z","Verry impressive","I must say that the most outstanding feature of this set is its excellent brick selection. These bits Iâ€™ve found very useful (and cool), the shark, the ladder, the surfboard, the seat, the turnabout under the seat (could always use another one of those two), the control panel on the first floor and the chain. The minifigs are cool, I like Snap's hair a lot and Pepper has knee pads on his legs (a nice detail). Playability is good too, all in all a very cool set.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T17:37:09Z","Good little beach shack","     This set I got for christmas is pretty good. I like snap lockitt, he has the coolest head, and the pepper is pretty common but worthy. I love that it comes with the elusive sharks and even a real surf board!!! Cool stickers, and a little peppy jet ski. The shack is pretty good with a little radio control thing on the second floor and a little chair at the top for snap. This is cool if you have a beach (lego) or especially if you have a town with a beach! 
It is a brwany 8, which is in my rating book, pretty daggone good!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

ALTERNATE MODELS: 8/10. BOth boats, one has instructions.

BEACH LOOKOUT: 10/10, by far. It has a 4x2 control panel.

"Tri_pod_king","2008-07-17T17:38:08.263Z","Go Pepper Roni!","This set contained my all-time favorite minifig: Pepper Roni. He consisted out of my favorite colors back then: red &amp; blue.(Now, my favorite colors are red, black, and silver)
                                              I got this set in the summer of '02, but still have fond memories of it. And if you're trying to make a Lego Jaws movie, USE THIS SET. It's perfect for that. Anyway, this set is the perfect summer theme for fun in the sun! The whole set is quite sturdy, and good for display and play purposes. It also comes with the right accessories, although I would've added an ATV and/or a life jacket. Last, but not least, this goes great with the Lego City Coast Guard theme.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-07T21:04:12.577Z","Awesome!","I got this set for X'mas 2002 and I loved it so much! The set comes with a watch tower with a computer inside, a sleek jetski, a life preserver, a dock, a sufboard and a shark. Also, it doesn't take up much space, so it would easily fit into a city. I had many adventures with it. However, after a few years, I chucked it and only kept a few useful pieces.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T17:14:24.82Z","BEWARE Sharks!","<p>Set #6736 Beach Lookout: This is the only LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts set I have left, I used to have two, this one and the pontoon plane. But I chose to get rid of the plane for space issues and because - at the time - I was thinking I might not want to keep them as part of my LEGO Collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set however is worth keeping and is one of the best out of the IXS Theme. You get to build a lifeguard tower (Beach Lookout) with a small pier and a jetski. The set also comes with a Shark, two Mini-Figures, some binoculars a walkie talkie, a shark lookout sign (really just a yeild shaped sign with a sticker on it.) and a life saver. (No, not the hard candy.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just rebuilt the set a few minutes ago and I'm still impressed with how interesting it looks. I'm not sure how clever it is, but it includes a few stickers something that some LEGO fans might not enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discovered this set long before I knew who the characters were supposed to be or that they were based on a video game. This Beach Lookout makes a nice change from all the Police, Firefighter and Coast Guard aquatic based sets out there for your City display. If you bought a couple extra sets you might even be able to make a large beach display if you wanted. Oh, did I forget to mention, it also comes with a surfboard? ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were to only get one IXS set this one might not be the most ideal - as far as Mini-Figures goes, but it might just proove the best one out of the group. (Although that Skate Park one looks kind of neat.)</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
