"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-21T09:59:06Z","A New Spring, A New Sound","Nice set. I can't skateboard but I like this set It has Pepper and his girlfriend Sky and a criminal friend of Brickster. I also like the Radio and the dustbin and the skateboards. The Fabuland thing is also a nice addition. Only the figs fall when you pull them of the ramp. The Fabuland thing works well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T22:51:03Z","Skate Park Legotime","This set is a perfect tenner contender because, who would ve' thought that they would have made an actual skatepark with a radio player, not me. Although that brainless, Dumpheaded, loath of slime minifig that goes down the slide on the box, should be disposed of. Why would Pepper and Sky want to skate with that acne faced funk, not me",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-14T01:57:55.403Z","Every LEGO city needs a Skateboard park ?","This set works and really is as cool as it looks. The skateboarder can use the bowl to brush up on thier tricks or go down the ramp which the will make it most of the time. You get stairs with the set a plus in my book, a cool looking Jam box radio for the dudes to tune out to and a trash can. Sky is in this set along with Pepper and one of Bricksters no good buddies - Great set Recommended. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-07-14T17:43:39.467Z","one of the best!","as i skateboard myself this set is pretty accurate. it comes with a slide (it actually works) but that has nothing to do with skate boarding, a vert ramp thats okay and the awesome three figures!

PROS:
figs
ramp slide

CONS:
bad ramp 
weird something

oh it also has a phone and boom box (oh yeah)!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2009-03-30T11:44:41.483Z","a good set","This is a very good set, it's cool and fun to play with. The stick pieces that attach to the backs of the minifigs are almost useless, except in MOCs.<br/><br/>pros:<br/>-great minifigs: Pepper, Sky, and a Brickster Henchman<br/>-accessories: 3 skateboards, radio, and a trash can<br/>-the lights swivel<br/>-the ramps are cool<br/>-parts<br/><br/>cons:<br/>-sticks that attach to the backs of the skateboarders<br/>-kind of fragile (not that much, but it is kind of)<br/><br/>Very nice set, it is a good addition to any collection, especially if you have a big Lego city.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-20T06:18:00.967Z","Best skateboard park ever!","This is awesome.  It has a slide, a pipe, and a ramp.  It also has 3 skateboarders with awesome skateboards.  Tha stickers are also personalizeable because you pick from a lot and use only the ones you want.  Overall the best playability ever in a set that wasn't star wars.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-30T22:56:30.653Z","Great To Have in Your Town","I own this, and it was worth getting. The halfpipe is very cool with all the lights and the slide which is a nice feature. The funbox is pretty cool too with the rail, but I also like the fact that you can fold it into a ramp for doing kickflips off of. Overall, this is a great set and it is a must own for Lego town fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legoluvr","2011-07-16T23:43:14.223Z","One of the Best","<br>Personally this was one of my favorite sets ever made. There is DAYS of playability in this set, and anyone who has any idea about Xtreme Stunts should get this set. There is many rare pieces, plenty of minifigs including Pepper Roni, Sky Lane, and one of the brickster's henchmen.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also many Light Tan colored bricks and elements, which I'm pretty sure are ONLY used in the Island Xtreme stunts series. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of the light posts come off easily though, and the whole idea of using the Lego poles to make the characters is kinda boring, these two cons are easily overwhelmed with the awesome half pipe, slide (for skateboarding, not minifigs!), grind rails, radio, and ramp.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The skateboards are great and customizable too! The set comes with 5 or 6 stickers to put on the 3 skate boards, and you can change between yellow or black wheels.&nbsp; Sadly, the yellow skate boards doesn't look too much like the one he uses in Lego Island 2 and Xtreme Stunts(video games), but its still cool.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set is much better than any Lego set of today's time, because legos are becoming more and more expensive, and there are too many small pieces for detail instead of where the money could be used to make the set bigger.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This set was easily worth $20 USD and is a collectors item. I have now seen this set selling sealed up to $300! So if you plan on getting this set to play with and don't mind buying an opened lego set (not me, i pay extra just so i can open the box because it brings me back some of my best memories) go to BRICK LINK and buy this set for a realistic price, like $20 to $60, compared to amazon or eBay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set is much better than those of today, and its from the best theme of all time.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"AETerry","2011-02-08T15:53:09.693Z","Skateboard Challenge Review","<p>I experienced something of a killjoy and mixed feelings when I first saw this set come out back around 2002. Gone now were the days when I used 1x3 plates and roof tiles for making my skateboards and ramps. Here now was a set that is an actual lego skateboard park and actual lego skateboards. I was elated and then I wanted to scream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what you have is, for me a comparatively simple build for making a ramp known as a half turnpike and then another ramp that's a slide and is on a turn plate so it swivels and then another smaller ramp for the skate boarders. Other little cool features are the boombox radio and the trashcan. And some flood lights so the skaters can skate at night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My complaints come in later with how easy it is for the Flood Lights to constantly come off and the end of the turnpike opposite from the stairs that always comes apart if you're not careful in setting it down or moving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with Extremem Island Stunts, Lego introduced the lego skate board and I know longer had to rely on little 1x3 plates for my skaters.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
