THE Trailer's lights go down to stabalize it, It's side ramps can carry the trikes, The cab of the car is HUGE! Its NOT JUNIORIZED... At all. It's a little unfair that the brickster has the chrome tailpipes. I think that's the Brickster cheating by putting 'em on. The flags on the back of the trikes are a nice touch. I don't really like the new 'Stunt Trikes', BUt these are an exception. These rule.

"hustla187","2008-05-16T19:33:57.793Z","Like the Trikes and the Minifigs","This is a great set to get. You get Pepper, Brickster, and Pepper's girlfriend whose name I forgot. I like the trikes and they are very cool espiecially the tailpipes. The truck is not juniorized which I like, but is a little big. This is a set you have to get!

It also has opening doors and two awesome trikes one with chromed turbo boposters.  Them ther is a trailer with opening sides and 3 people.  A bad guy, a driver, and a girl.  Overall it is cool so get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cbowers","2011-02-04T11:01:25.83Z","WOW HUGE TRUCK!","<p>I usually would never stoop this low. But here goes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros: </p>
<p>There are some minifigs. </p>
<p>The color orange. </p>
<p>Tri-bikes</p>
<p>The truck cab is decent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>Size: Do we really need a truck this big to carry two trikes? </p>
<p>This theme crashed and burned. This was this themes worst set. IMO</p>
<p>Well besides the skate park. That was almost pointless. </p>
<p>If you like this set, then you should check out the plane, boat and base and lifeguard house. Those are the good-uns. This was my only substitute for city in the dark ages. </p>
<p>Okay, so the truck bed is one giant useless piece. </p>
<p>Those neon lights...</p>
<p>mini-figs are boring. </p>
<p>This doesnt fit on any roadplates and doesn't belong in a city. </p>",TRUE,1,1,1,2,3

<p>Just got this set a few days ago with a majority of the other Lego Island Extreme stunts I purchased in a bundle. This set is very cool, They don&#39;t make sets like this anymore I honestly wish I had sets like this when I was younger, but the time had come. Set was worth it for sure, for a kid this would be fun to play with and to build. I thought the trailer was a pretty cool piece never seen anything like it before. Overall the Lego set is Awesome! and super fun!</p>

<p>Not great with reviews,&nbsp;as the time of this review I didn&#39;t have much knowledge of how to create excellent reviews.&nbsp;</p>
