I like the colour scheme, but in this set in special, they combine a truck without driver, with a forklift with space for its driver. Maybe&nbsp;this forklift is the highlight of this set.<br />
<br />
Those sets are very simple, I value them as examples of the early designs of vehicles in the minifig era.</p>

What happened here?&nbsp;The minifig&nbsp;can use the forklift, but not the truck anymore? What&#39;s the point of this? Yeah, I know, parts saving!&nbsp;Or more likely: lazy designers with short deadlines.&nbsp;It never turns out. We know the end result is a half-usable set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig:</strong>&nbsp;always great, especially the eternally optimistic smile :)</p>

<p><strong>Forklift:</strong> usable</p>

<p><strong>Truck/Lorry:</strong>&nbsp;well, can deliver 1 box, that&#39;s something. If it has a self-driving app, it&rsquo;s no problem,&nbsp;but poor guy can take a taxi home :(</p>

<p>My solution to&nbsp;fixing the problem,&nbsp;of course from contemporary parts:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were no vehicle roof pieces at the time.&nbsp;Otherwise, there is a similar truck at the back of the set box as an alternative build.</p>

<p>To do this, use the forklift steering wheel and doors.</p>

<p>Ohh, almost forgot the forklift. I didn&rsquo;t notice it on the boxart, but if we build the forklift according to the instructions then we can&rsquo;t push the fork all the way down because that fingers gets stuck between the windshield. Especially if you&#39;re an adult.</p>

<p>To be able to put the booth back at a distance of 1 stud, I had to replace the blue 4x6 plate with a 4x8 plate.&nbsp;So, on the other hand, there was enough space left to create a small detail on the back of the forklift&nbsp;because the original version was pretty boring.</p>
