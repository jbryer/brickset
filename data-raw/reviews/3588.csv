"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T11:04:51Z","Nice","I personally love LEGO Island, and this, sadly, was the only real building from the game.  It is the Xtreme Stunts version of the Information Center, and very different from the previous games' versions.  I prefer the others, but this one is nice, too.  I like the Infomaniac figure the best, I've always thought that he was cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-21T16:17:14Z","This Rocks","    I got this set for only 25 bucks at legoshop.com.
Boy, what a cheap price for how great this is. My brother, Kieth and I have a large lego town and this is one of the best buildings in it. It is tall, sturdy, and easy to put together and put BACK together. The bottom room has a door ofcourse and a mail box, but also this really awesome, huge computer/keyboard. The helicopter is cool and that infomniac geezer pilots it. The stairs that go up to the helipad are the best. Like in the harrypotter sets, they wind and are hyper-sturdy. Bricksetr and his dimwitted hitmen are included. The tower is held up by the large pole things and have alot of radar mish-mesh on them. The tower is cool because it swings around and it holds an awesome visual-display keyboard. It also has a platform with a &quot;bungee cord&quot; on it so Pepper can leap off and die. It also includes that elusive Sky Lane, ofcourse that old infomniac, and a little buggy for brickster. I give this set a 10 because their is simply nothing wrong with it. Get it on bricklink or legoshop or ebay now!!!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T17:38:57Z","If only a bit more complex","I never did get the &quot;bungee cord&quot; right, it was more like jumping to your death(Pepper hit the folding glass more often than not).I enjoyed the climbing wall,having the brickster's guys climb just high enough to have the top spin around and knock them off.I had this building be the capital of my town for awhile with me (Pepper) as president. The Brickster's car is nice but hard to keep together when all my little brother and sister wanted it destroyed:) The only downfall is that the set is very junorized.The stairs are very cool I don't know how many ways they can be used:(",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-16T20:26:26Z","Am I the only one who misses the old infomaniac?","I like the set, but the minifigures just aren't close enough to the original Lego Island game. Sigh... Oh well, I guess you can't improve upon perfection even though LEGO sure thinks they can.

The only flaws are that the stairs on the one side of it are poorly built and the helicopter is not all too great. But other than those, it is a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-23T13:40:22.56Z","Good, but not the best","Come to think of it, this set does seem a bit empty. The vehicles and accessories are great, but the building leaves something to be desired.

Pros:

-Building has nice windows
-Stairs and railing are realistic
-Informaniac's office can rotate and has an advanced computer
-Bungee cord device
-Radar dishes
-Side of the building has built in ladder
-Glass roof opens to allow Pepper in when he bungee jumps
-Main floor has another advanced computer that can open
-There is a safe beside the entrance with a computer chip inside
-Helicopter has winch and a zip line handle
-Landing pad is cool
-Brickster's car looks pretty cool
-Comes with the Informaniac, Pepper, Sky Lane with skateboard, Brickster and 2 henchmen



Cons:

-Stairs don't lead to anywhere
-Building should have more rooms, not just supports that separate the main and topmost floors
-Front lawn is a bit plain

Overall decent set but could be a little better",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Informatic minifigure(Very hard to find, as he was only in 2 sets, 1 of them being a promo)</li><li>Small Dune Buggy is cool</li><li>Helicopter(rare-ish orange parts)</li><li>Cool accesories</li><li>minifigures are cool</li><li>Tower features cool rock wall and spinning office at the top</li><li>Bungee jumping area at the office</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Helicopter can sometimes fall off of the landing pad, but if you know how to position it, that doesn't happen</li><li>Nothing else....</li></ul><div>So overall, this set is great, especially if you can get it for a good price. &nbsp;The original price is a bit steep but still good, so if you get it for any less, you got a good deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"KyEzOaR_","2017-03-15T14:39:24.11Z","Nice Tower From Lego Island","<p>The Extreme Tower from the island extreme stunts theme has a ton of rare parts and cool play-</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The &quot;magic&quot; stairs can move out of place really easy</li>
	<li>Its takes a long time to wind the rope for the zipline on the helicopter</li>

	<li>this could be just my copy but the computer in the tower under the skylight can get stuck on the wall when opening it up</li>

</ul>

<p>In conclusion this set has many play features in it build it is a little too expensive for the part count but you can try to find deal on the bricklink and eBay. (i got mine for $17.00)</p>
