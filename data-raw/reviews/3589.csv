It's a good way to get a teepee but if that's what you're after don't buy Lego.Good way to get the chief but could have used an extra fig. The totem is ugly and there really isn't anything besides the teepee.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lego_in_the_Box","2008-11-17T20:15:15.763Z","Big Chief have Puny Land!","Although this set is certainly not the model for the avid collector, it is a good Western starter set. It is also a good way to get your hands on a tepee and a Chief. It comes with a considerable amount of pieces, and many minifig accessories. The set includes(in terms of minifig accessories) two bows and arrows, one quiver, a tomahawk, two spears, two shields, and two snakes(if you count those as weapons). It also includes a fairly rare piece, a cooking pot. It includes three minifigs, a Chief, a male, and a female. The tepee, probably the most desirable part along with the Chief and horse is the black and red type with the horse right above the entrance. The totem pole is not much, but it opens up to reveal a hiding place for the snakes. A brown and white horse and a blue saddle are also included. Overall, the Chief's Tepee isn't a great set, but pretty decent.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"_obelix_","2008-12-09T20:06:49.327Z","Indian Hunting Outpost","This is the first indian set i got and its a good one. Not the biggest but still fun to build and play, this set made into my top of all western sets, making me want to collect all the other indians. It has everything a small outpost is supposed to have, a tepee, a totem, small stream, tree trunk, and all the other small, neat accessories that hunting outpost (which i am guessing this is) is supposed to have. It has two figures of hunters with full gear, and a visiting chief.

No cons.

5 out of 5 from me...

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-26T10:29:44.613Z","LEGO Western - Chief's Tepee Review","This set is one of the cheapest ways to get a LEGO tepee. The tepee is made out of a cloth material and looks really nice. The whole set is really easy tu build but it's also fun. This model is very sturdy, too and you also won't have to complain about stickers. We also get a printed horse, some useful weapons, rare shields and a cool looking totem with a gray eagle on the top. If you sviwel the totem you can see a platform which has a black snake in it which can slide into the river if you which is next to the platform if you want. I also can't complain about the minifigs. I think it's the cheapest way to find a female indian. This set is a really good model to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"whaleyland","2012-09-12T17:19:19.98Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: Stereotypical Sioux of the Wild West","<p>
 The 1997 line of Westerners LEGOs focused almost exclusively on the &quot;Indians&quot; theme of the Wild West. While the 1996 line looked at the battle of the cavalry and townsfolk against the bandits, 1997 brought a new player onto the scene that was never entirely defined. Indians sets didn&#39;t include a single figure from the previous year, suggesting that while Indians were certainly a subgroup of the line, they were pretty much separate from it. Of the seven Indians sets released, I only owned one, the small Chief&#39;s Tepee, which is reviewed here.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Innovations: There were numerous innovations with the line, the most obvious being the 360&deg; cloth tepee that wrapped around two new poles that could hold it up. The use of basic colors to build things such as totem poles were also new, though not entirely innovative. Perhaps the most happy addition was the painting of the classic horse figures with all sorts of Indian artwork. Examples of all of these are included in the Chief&#39;s Tepee, though not much else is present worth noting.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Lack of Inspiration: Predictably, the Indians line fell into the stereotypes of the Wild West. The Indians are in fact Sioux, which means they are not the types of Indians that most of these Westerners would have actually encountered. Regardless, the use of a totem pole is foreign (totem poles are Eskimo in origin) and the repetition of the same two tepees and same five minifigures across the entire subline suggests that it was intended to be a short-lived series. The lack of detail at the campsite may be to keep costs down, but it is obvious, and the few items that are included seem out of place. Despite the inclusion of the tepee and painted horse, the set is subpar at best.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 What It Got Right: Visually, it gets everything right. The tepee is still fun to look at even if its playability is lacking. The three minifigures and the horse are very welcome additions. The inclusion of bows and arrows, snakes, two new shields, and the new stump piece are all welcome as well. The only gimmick in this set is the totem pole, which when turned 90&deg; reveals a box holding a snake. A rather sad revelation, but it&#39;s something at least.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Possible Improvements: It&#39;s hard to really say what specifically would improve the sets much. Despite the elegant design of the tepee, I think a tepee that is only 180&deg; would have been better so that kids could access the back more easily. A solid plot for the entire Indians line would have helped guide kids in establishing a role for the Indians within the Westerners universe. Furthermore, the set appears sparse, like it is missing something. I don&#39;t really know what. An attempt at making a LEGO stream at the right fails utterly. perhaps some rocks should have been built there instead. The totem pole has to go and a better gimmick should have been found to make this set have some play appeal.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigure: This set included three minigures which are repeated throughout the line. Importantly, it included the chief, who had a detailed feather headdress, sequenced shirt, and matching pants. It is a fairly detailed figure for the time though current attempts could be made better and have been with the chief included in the Collectible Minifigure series. A second male Indian also is included, and he is wearing a red shirt with details and matching pants. He also has an arrow quiver on his back and feathers coming out of his hair, which are tacky but also a fun detail. The only female of the tribe, apparently, is included wearing beige torso and legs with mostly red details painted on them. She has the same quiver and hair as the red Indian man. Her face shows a slinty-eyed woman with a downward pointed nose and red lips. The same nose appears on the two men, who also have slinty eyes and facepaint under their eyes. Overall, it is a good selection of figures, though all will be repeated with the ownership of multiple Indians sets.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 How it Compares: This set is largely a bust, especially compared to the much larger Rapid River Village and Boulder Cliff Canyon sets. One notable absence from this set is the medicine man, who is included in many other Indians sets. While this set and its series cannot really compare to other series that have been released just because of its contents, numerous attempts at other ethnic/historical periods have been attempted before with better results. From the Adventurers Orient theme to the Pirates of the Caribbean theme to the Ninja Castle theme, they all have more historically-accurate portrayals that do less insult to the cultures being portrayed. While I will always love and display this set alongside my other Westerners sets, I keep it in town beside the General Store as more of a trading post than an actual representation of a Sioux village because, honestly, the set is a bit disturbing. Hopefully future attempts at re-rendering the Wild West will produce a more accurate and nuanced portrayal of native Americans.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 QUALITY SCORE: 5/10</p>
