"Gus_263","2008-03-13T15:46:13.047Z","Little classic","This small set released in 1992 is a classic, with few pieces, but all these are much useful, and the set is also playable. The set includes a shark minifigure, a pirate minifigure, and the both are good designed, in the classic style. The pirate also includes a hat and two weapons. The cannon is another useful piece that be fixed very well in the small plate. The little wall have some designs to characterize it, and the flag with a pirate symbol is another nice feature, but also simple. This set is very small, but the pieces are much useful and the set is basically a small set from the lego pirates series. So, i rate the Battle Cove 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-20T12:45:02.61Z","Battle Cove Review","<p>This was a good little set, that could easily be incorporated into a large set or MOC design with Pirates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rock wall suggests that it's in part of a larger structure that it's hiding out of. It's a good set to get a shark from, cannon, pirate, flag and weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a fun little set and perfect for fleshing out a larger collection of Pirates.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<p>It&#39;s so small, with only 26 pieces, but what you get for it is simply amazing. After only 9 building steps we have a piece of island with some ruins and weaponry&nbsp;and a lonely pirate, using his canon to try&nbsp;to fend off this vicious looking shark that is&nbsp;waiting for his chance to take a bite out of that scruffy looking pirate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the pieces are few, there is still a lot of dept in the finished model. This is mainly achieved through the types of pieces used and in the way they are stacked together. The wallpanel and the cornerpiece&nbsp;create a ruined hide-out, cave-like structure with a small defensive&nbsp;wall, used to place the cannon onto. The palm leave creates a nice roof and completes the entire build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set could work well as a defensive outpost when added to some of the larger pirate sets like &quot;the forbidden island&quot; or even better &quot;the rock island refuge&quot; set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The printed panel and the pirate flag give the set some necessary detailing, without making it too &quot;in-your-face&quot;</p>

<p>De minifigure is your standard 1989-1990 pirate, with a nicely printed torso and head. Not bad, but you will stockpile on these guys, once you start collecting pirate sets. Same goes for the shark, nice, but maybe it would have been better if Lego would have diversified their sea-animals over the different Pirate sets. Furthermore, I&nbsp;sometimes wish that Lego would have tried to bring a little bit more variety in their first-wave pirate minifigures.</p>

<p>All in all, this set is wonderful: a canon, printed wall-panel, printed flag, shark, minifigure and 2 weapons: what more could you expect from a small set like this?</p>

<p>PROS:<br />
-printed pieces<br />
-accessories<br />
-canon<br />
-nice build</p>

<p>CONS:<br />
-same old minfigure<br />
-same old shark</p>
