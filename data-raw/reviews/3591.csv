"shenron","2007-12-28T04:15:25.92Z","Lovely town addition","Albeit limited, this set looks great in a town diorama.

The interiors could benefit from the addition of a cooking stove and a small storage furniture, but the limited space allows only for the counter. Another possible improvement would be adding a sort of shutter for when the snack bar closes (my suggestion is to use a half roller door, after modifying the front wall a little).

The set includes a cook and a customer, which is nice for such a small model, and some nice additions in the form of drinks (cups and &quot;cans&quot;), a tree and a road sign. The latter is a unique piece, together with the snack bar ensign.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-12T17:44:39.61Z","A neccessity","This is one of my all-time favourites and it took me the better half of the aforementioned time before I could lay my hands on it.

A timeless design with a fresh-looking colour scheme. This quality doesn't make this set 'main-street material' though. I mean; let's face it, in the real world this thing would be nothing more than a shabby cram-shack. There's a good reason for the fact that this is the only set that comes with a roadsign to draw in customers...

And that's why I love it so much. This thing belongs in the shadow behind the race-track stands, or half hidden between the trees near the little beach at the lakeside, or next to the bus station to feed all those weary commuters.
It's nothing much, but you can't do without it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

i just love these old lego town sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-04-14T14:40:10.06Z","Lovely set","How wonderful this set is after all those years. Although very basic, it fits in every town, has several special bricks and has some reduced but well placed details in it. I loved the minifig chef, he had a lot to work in my cities all the time. While i am rebuying my old collection which was lost through the years, this one was the very first to come back - because i still have the sweetest memories of this set. Even little cups were there, and simple red and yellow bricks were all the tasty food or canned beverages you could imagine. Maybe the later food-service-packs were more detailed, but this one will always be my favourite.

It's a vintage classic town set and a must have in any self respecting Lego Town. It comes complete with a cook and a customer and works wonders near train/bus stations etc.<br><br>Plus for this set is that it is rather easy to assemble from other blocks....<br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,5,3,2,5,5

<p>The Chef&#39;s outfit, the icecream-picture&nbsp;bricks, the sign and tree make this set wonderful. Also has a cool color scheme.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before, and it is true for this set as well: the details make it work so well. Great addition in&nbsp;any town.</p>

"Niki124","2021-02-02T22:51:35.017Z","Even better than I'd dreamed it would be","<p>When my sister and I first started getting interested in minifigures Lego, this was the set I dreamed of - to the extent that I tried to build a version from my Lego Basics Set 3. This was the first building we owned (everything before had been a vehicle) so this really was a step up for us.</p>

<p>It did not disappoint. In my mind, the yellow cylindrical bricks were lemonade cans, the red were cola cans, the mugs always contained coffee and not tea. I loved the little cash register, and did not care that the proprietor seemed rather over-dressed.</p>

<p>This was a little more challenging to build than previous sets, but this made it more satisfactory and helped to broaden my horizons in terms of what I could build, and how to make the most of different size bricks.</p>

<p>No stickers, everything is printed on the bricks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cans, Cups and register machine included.</p>

<p>The set fitted well to my first ever city back in the 80&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

"peti7788","2021-11-13T21:40:30.85Z","Rare parts and takeaway option","<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the town&rsquo;s smaller commercial buildings, which makes a Lego town much more lifelike.&nbsp;This bar and a furniture store were very catchy, which was in the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6000-1/LEGOLAND-Idea-Book"" target=""_blank""> 6000 idea book.</a>&nbsp;As a kid, I didn&rsquo;t have much Lego&nbsp;and was happy with a building that didn&rsquo;t need a lot of bricks.</p>

<p>It took me a very long time to collect&nbsp;the parts for this set.&nbsp;I inherited it from relatives as a child, but the two signs were missing.&nbsp;When I got the set, it was already at least 10-15 years old, in a fairly used condition. Then, as a kid, I temporarily replaced the stickers from an idea book.&nbsp;Unfortunately back then, there was no bricklink in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, I clearly remember that I immediately expanded the set.&nbsp;I felt so empty, so I added 2 tables and chairs to it.&nbsp;I used a larger baseplate for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, there was the expansion, yet it was like something was still missing.&nbsp;I need some vehicle, say a takeaway scooter.&nbsp;My pre-form&nbsp;white motorcycle frame has already been used by police.&nbsp;I wanted a red one anyway. Fortunately, the idea book also had motorcycles assembled from plates.&nbsp;So I used the guest as a takeaway guy.&nbsp;Poor guy, even though he just wanted to eat a good one, yet I sent him to work it... :)</p>

<p>When I reassembled the set, I found the basic scooter I had built as a kid. So this scooter could have been built from the 1979 parts inventory as well.</p>

<h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Very cute set, I recommend. It&rsquo;s just hard to find the two signs, the others parts are thankfully basic. A takeaway scooter is really missing from the set.&nbsp;I think a scooter has a much bigger gaming experience, at least that&rsquo;s how I felt like a kid.</p>
