another set that i'd say is well worth paying $100 for on eBay. i wouldn't sell mine for any less.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Snail","2018-08-29T20:20:39.48Z","Unique model, unusual build","<p>Somewhere between classic space and futuron, this robot is an odd but special set.</p>

<p>Almost the whole torso consists of the 9V battery box that is orientated vertically, and every other element in the build has to adjust to this, resulting in very unusual SNOT techniques for such an early model &ndash; the shoulders have the studs orientated frontside, the head is actually upside down, the base plate is attached with 90&deg; corners. Yet, the whole model doesn&#39;t look forced, nor is it overly fragile.</p>

<p>The playabilty is great: The light and sound of course is pure nostalgia, the arms are movable and can have clamps or shovels attached, the head can twist, and the two minifigs can launch off the base plate and fly around.&nbsp; only the base is a bit uninspired for my taste ... Mr. robot has to fly around somehow, he can&#39;t walk.</p>

<p>Bricklinking this may be a bit expensive due to the yellow tubes, but if missing this set in a collection, it&#39;s worth the money.</p>
