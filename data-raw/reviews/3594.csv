"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-15T12:01:29Z","PIKICHU MUST BE DESTROYED!","The Bandits' Secret Hideout is yet another great addition to the Wild West theme. Just getting started on the mine makes me want to extend the mining shafts down and sideways with tunnels and hidden passages all over the place (of course several of my castle sets will have to suffer and become assimilated into this mountainous effort if it is ever to be).
For now I'm happy to just do some dreaming and plan out some of the stuff I'll work on in the future. I like the set because it gives a good combination of brown, black and grey bricks for some good building variations (though I would have liked a few more brown bricks if this were my first or only Wild West set).
The set is made up of the main mine structure, a secondary rock formation and a water barrel. The secondary rock formation is set to the right of the main entrance and there isn't much to it (though it does serve as a place to hide behind or climb atop). The water barrel (to the left of the mine) sits on a platform and has a little spigot that comes out at the bottom (like an old fashion water tower), it's just the right size to hide a sitting minifig and is built so it can tip over on somebody (don't ask me why I think it is cool, I just do). The centerpiece of the set is a three level design that looks like the mouth to a mine with the first two levels comprising the mining shaft. The first level has a main entrance and the second level has a small shack whose interior also opens into the shaft. The third level is more of a plateau type precipice which sits on top of the shaft with a rock wall to hide behind. (I think I would have liked this to drop into the shaft too, but that can be easily built into the set with the pieces they supply you with.) The second level shack has a one-piece set of steps which runs up to the door, this piece fits snugly to the shack entrance but can come loose and be knocked over as a means of deterring (and maybe even breaking any legs of) any would-be intruders. The shack floor is fairly small so that once inside, the minifigs can jump down to the first level and roam around the mine. The main level entrance has kind of a lame booby trap that consists of a mine car (with a cannon mounted on it) on rails. The exterior end of these rails rests on a 2x2 smooth-bottom round tile that is attached to a string. The string is stretched across the dirt trail that passes the entrance of the mine entrance and is secured at the opposite end of the trail. When nosey meddlers pass over the trail and trip the string, the smooth-bottom tile pulls out from under the rails (dropping the exterior end down) and the cannon rolls down the rails and out at the unaware trespasser. Boo! Did I scare you? I didn't think so, but the idea of the cannon on railcar wheels is neat. There is space on the back end for a minifig to stand on and ride out with the car. There's also a place on the roof of the shack where a bandit can roll a small barrel down on somebody entering the mine. (Are you getting the idea that this is not a good place for small children to play yet?)
Minifigs include three bandits: the green shirt top-hat gambler guy, all-in-black (but a brown cowboy hat, come on Lego, I want a black cowboy hat!) Flatfoot Thomsen, and badly-needs-dental-work red jersey hairy-chest dude. There are also two cavalry men plus three horses (brown, black and white), I do appreciate the variety of horses, Lego.
There is a saddle-brace carrier that goes over the back of one of the horses that holds a bank safe on one side and rifle box on the other side. Something like this really ought to be loaded on a mule but I reckon the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wasn't around in the 1800's.
New unique parts include the 1x16 rails (that look an awful lot like the old 12-volt train tracks--all plastic with little teeth running along the top edge of the rail, but these are spaced two pegs apart), the cool railway wheels that the cannon rolls on, 1x2 and 1x4 molded &quot;log&quot; bricks, the big barrel, pistols and rifles (if you haven't picked up a Wild West set yet), and an extra cowboy hat and skeleton skull for the &quot;keep out&quot; sign that goes in front of the mine. I dig this extra skeleton head and I'm real tempted to put it on one of my bandits so he can be a real &quot;ghost rider&quot;!
Wrapping things up, I was very impressed with the hideout set. It's ten dollars less than the 6765 - Gold City Junction but is just as enjoyable and almost as much an integral part of any frontier settlement.

There are several collapsible components to this set. The water barrel and staircase can both fall down, presumably as traps to deter any intruders. Also, the gold mine sign on the roof can be tilted upwards to release a barrel. Last but not least&nbsp;is the surprise attack cannon, which is released when the&nbsp;horse trips a string attached to a rock&nbsp;that supports the mine tracks. However, for all the set&#39;s splendor, it is not without faults. The inside of the mine is virtually empty, containing only a chair on the top floor and bits of cannon ammo on the bottom.</p>

"shoobathelemur","2008-10-23T21:56:41.607Z","A classic example of why Lego should bring more older sets back!","This set was a favorite of mine when I was younger and when I began reassembling my collection, it leapt to the top of my want list. I picked it up on eBay along with the Sheriff's Lockup with the original box and instructions. The set offers a great balance of soldiers (2) to bandits (all 3). The abandoned gold mine concept was a great idea and the trip wire that releases the cannon is a novel approach. Also, this set came with several of the large rock pieces that have a wide range of uses no matter what theme. The set can be rebuilt into a few equally interesting alternate models and is the perfect hideout for your western troublemakers.

All in all, this is a must have for any western fan and I'm very glad I was able to acquire this set for the second time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"whaleyland","2012-08-15T16:59:35.47Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: Bad Guys Wanted, Inquire Within","<p>
 Like every good theme based around structures rather than vehicles, the bad guys always need a set of their own. You can see this in numerous LEGO series, though many neglect the bad guy base. It&#39;s unfortunate, really, but a good thing LEGO did not neglect it here, because the Bandit&#39;s Secret Hide-Out is one of the most visually interesting sets in the Westerners line.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Innovations: Every little trick in the Westerners series seems to be done here in this set, with more to boot. Extensive use of large, molded rock bricks allows for a lot of open space inside the Gold Mine and elsewhere. Yet, the entire set could have just been a small cave. Instead, it has an old office building built on the mountainside, a gun rack mounted nearby, a train-wheeled canon that shoots out of the mine like a mine car, and even a bucket that falls over on unsuspecting people. Add to those collapsing stairs, a hidden card room, a horse carrying supplies, and a few hidden treasure caches. This set definitely goes all out with the details and the playability.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Lack of Inspiration: Honestly, this set lacks no inspiration. The only thing limiting it is its price, which was $39.99 at the time of release. This lower price point made the five&mdash;yes, five&mdash;preconstructed rock bricks necessary. And the set makes good use of them, but behind the rock is a somewhat awkward cardroom that logically makes no sense; the inside of the mine is far more spacious than a real mine would be; and the &quot;A&quot; shaped rock on the roof is wide open on the backside. Using real bricks could have achieved the same visual quality while addressing these problems, but the price would have probably gone up at least $10. Other small things, such as the rolling gun, are cool but illogical.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 What It Got Right: The set got its playability down, which some of the other Westerners sets, specifically Fort LEGORADO, lack in droves. Just see the innovations list above, this set is FUN! Perhaps its best part is that it includes all three bandits, as well as two soldiers. It also comes with three horses and a new baseplate which most LEGO fans wish was more widely available. They also weren&#39;t cheap with the shrubgrass bushes, which are everywhere. This set definitely looks good.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Possible Improvements: With increased playability comes a loss somewhere. I&#39;ve already mentioned the preconstructed rock bricks, but other gimmicky things could also have been better handled. The canon could have been installed and an actual minecar could have been included. The mine itself was a missed opportunity that could have been fun to look into. The new Lord of the Rings horses show just how dated these horses were, and I believe a new go at this series would improve the visual splendor tenfold, which is saying a lot regarding this set. A second baseplate would have been nice, but that&#39;s just me. :-)</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigure: This set comes with the lot of them. All three bandits are included&mdash;Bandit #1 with his mustached scowl under a black bandana and all around black clothes, Bandit #2 with his redneck charms alongside his rotting teeth, and Bandit #3 sporting his tophat and top-class green sports coat. To rival these two come two soldiers from the Fort: the cavalry lieutenant wearing an uncharacteristic white bandana around his neck alongside his saber, and his subordinate soldier with his kepi hat and gold-chrome trumpet. This set leaves nothing to wish for regarding minifigures, though a modern rendition of this series would certainly improve the quality of the figures, with full-body art patterns and double faces.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 How it Compares: Bandit&#39;s Secret Hide-Out remains one of the best bad guy bases in LEGO&#39;s history, sitting right beside Castle-themed palaces and Space-aged fortresses. It&#39;s simple and cheap, but that does not make it bad, and LEGO has come up with little to rival it for what it is. If you collect Westerners sets or anticipate collecting them, this set is a must-buy and a fun addition to any Westerners theme.</p>
<p>

 QUALITY SCORE: 9.5/10<br />

"The_Stig2","2010-07-08T11:52:15.983Z","Simply one of the best sets ever","This has to be among the greatest sets of all time. It's an abandoned gold mine used as a secret hideout by bandits. It features a lot of amusing traps, like the falling stairs or the barrel rolling from the roof; inside you get a small room with a window and then, behind the grey rocks, a large cave where bandits can store their weapons, play cards or plan the next robbery. There is also a machinegun on the top of the rocks to defend from incoming cavalry soldiers. Minifigures are really nice, you get three bandits (which is great) and two soldiers with their horses. The set also contain plenty of weapons and accessories. The gold mine is so amazing that you can play with it for ages without getting tired...<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"zako11","2010-08-13T15:18:47.55Z","Arrest Those Bandits","<p>This set is brilliant for starters it has a secret trap an the roof where theres a falling barrel ,also it has a stair case that falls backwards ,then theres the trap where a bit of string is pulled and then a cannon comes rolling out of the mine.it also has a great selection of minifigures and this time (unlike in fort legoredo)the bandits outnumber the blue army people.there&nbsp;are pleanty of weapons in this set there are:9 shotguns, 2 swords,5 pistols and a pick axe.There is a little box where you can place a shotgun a safe where you can put the money from the set or you could put it in a bit of mountain that lifts off&nbsp;so you can place money in there.</p>
<p>Other features are:theres a collapsing barrel,a stick of dinomite,some playing cards (on a flat 1x2 piece),a trumpet, a tripple shotgun machine and a little cabin to play in.the one badish thing about the set is theres a parrot and ive never known a parrot in the wild west but if you have pirates its another parrot to add to your collection. i have no idea what the original price was in english but i dont know if $40 was intirerly worth it ,i guess it would have been Â£30 in english but the good thing for me was i got it for free off my cousin.I would definately recommend this set to a friend because of how fun it is,also you can rebuild it in many different ways which means endless creation fun .if your a fan of wild west get this set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
