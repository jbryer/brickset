"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-04T11:21:54Z","My favourite set of all time!","From the tradoors in the lounge to the four sections of this masterpiece of a set, this set has it all. Just add some beds and some more canons and guns for defense and maybe a rack of guns and you've got a really nice set. You can also fit A few other sets like the bank inside.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T12:57:08Z","A WHAT?! 4 sided &quot;castle&quot; ?! WOW!","How many Lego castles have you seen that are 4 sided?  This set is not only 4-sided, it has LOTS of room &quot;inside&quot;.  10 figures, plus a cannon is also great, and because the figures are special cowboy ones, it makes the set even better.  

I really like this set, but it's still not as appealing as the castle sets because I don't like the brown bricks as much and it doesn't look quite so stylish. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-17T11:35:42Z","[♦][♣][♠][♥]","This set is a gem in the LEGO universe, with several new pieces, great versatility, and great possibilities. 
The set separates into four sections, which can be reconnected in many ways, either to make a different or better fort, or just to get in there and play with it easier. I keep mine the same as it is in the instructions. 

The most notable section is the back wall, or that with the Headquarters, jail cell, and “stable”. Inside the Headquarters, there are two chairs and a circular table. If the table is rotated in one direction, the floor beneath one of the chairs will fall, and the former occupant of the seat will decend to the room below him, and not in a very graceful manner. This mechanism is rigged underneath both of the two chairs. If the man in the chair near the door falls, he will land in the “stable”. If the man in the other seat falls, he lands in the jail! Neat trick. The thing I don’t like about the back section is that a horse can’t fit in the stable without having to bend his neck downward (which, as I happen to know, makes the horse’s neck extremely loose and squeaky). 

The set is just plain impressive. The size was one thing that got me excited about it, and the fact that it could open up just like the older Castle sets could (before those silly mountain baseplates came out). The horns on the rooves look sort of goofy, but it’s easy to take them off. I like the Union Army minifigures a lot more than the figures from the pirate sets. It’s good that the soldiers have a way to get up to the catwalks, in the form of a ladder or two, which increases it’s playability. All of the ceilings open up, which also increases the set’s playability. This set is especially good in conjuction with the 1997 sets 6706 Frontier Patrol and Weapons 6716 Weapons Wagon. 

All in all, this set is great, complete with good-guys, bad-guys, locking doors, and trap-doors, a LEGO classic!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Get the western thingy majigger NOW because when you wait until your crippled and old, the set will be a vacant lot in this lego business!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T19:43:04Z","The Way out West","Many people say that this is a legend, and it is. I got it for christmas and I have built and it is well developed in a western society. Cowboys and the west go well for lovers and the walls are strong. There id a wicked trap that leads to a prison in the generals office. It is also really cool. The connection to the walls is a bit weak but who gives a smoke. All the men that it comes with, twelve are awesome including the gold hidings. I'am glad that plants are with it too otherwise it would be bareen. Everything about it is good and it is by far my favorite set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-26T19:55:48.8Z","Fort Legoredo","This is probably my favourite Lego set, its modular design makes it possible to build two smaller forts. Each section is unique, but the rear headquarters section is by far the most interesting. It has a card table that triggers two trap doors depending on which way it is turned. This set also has tons of minifigs and pieces which are great for people who enjoy creating their own models.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-04-15T14:48:31.857Z","One of the best sets ever!","Another &quot;Lego Hall of Fame&quot; set that I mentioned with the Rock raiders HQ. This is a very good set for lego Exo-Force, lego Starwars, or any kind of battle set. I love the wooden pieces that go with it. It is good for a child that isn't crazy and is calm. You wouldn't want this set destroyed by someone else. I highly recommend this set for every lego collector of any age, except 3 and under of course!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Crazybrick45","2009-06-20T19:13:23.61Z","An epic LEGO set!","This set is BRILLIANT! 10 minfigs!  It has 6 soldiers, a deputy, and 3 robbers! There are so many cool things about this set... let's get straight to the pros and cons!

Mini-compartment in the corner holds an extra rifle
Tons of parrots! Parrots are awsome! Do you agree?! 
Rare(I think)bugle piece
