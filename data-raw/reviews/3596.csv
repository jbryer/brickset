Only there is no inventory in the tipi's. The Riverground is very good. You can make a river with more of these sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The detail on the teepees, the hollowed out trunks, the shrubs, all contributed to my liking. The amount of time I spent playing with this set greatly advanced my knowledge of how to put legos together in order to hold. Even my family members enjoyed pulling all the traps and spending time with it. If you ever find this on ebay, bid on it, you will be happy you did.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
