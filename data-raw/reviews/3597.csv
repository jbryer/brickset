One year later, TLC re-releases it! This set is a great add on to a Western town. The left side of the jail flies off when you insert a dynamite piece through a slot, which hits a spring lever, which pops up and bumps the wall. There is a safe, a piece (same size as dynamite) that represents a wanted poster, offering a $500 reward for Flatfoot Thompson, who I believe is the bandit in red in this set, a realistic Western leaning chair, a horse, and desk thats top lifts off to reveal gold coins. Minifigs are a sheriff, deputy/cowboy, bandit in green, and a bandit in red, who both have very detailed facial expressions.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

conclusion-get this set if you like western legos. its a great addition to any collection. 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
