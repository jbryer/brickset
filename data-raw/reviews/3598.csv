Compare this set to the more expensive re-released 10041 Main Street set, and you cannot argue the value of this amazing set.  One of the best value sets there is. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-10T17:40:01Z","GREAT!","This was my first western set, and I still love it! The exploding bank and the wagon is extremly cool. It does also fit in a modern town. I wish there were more western buildings. But this set is great!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-15T12:05:13Z","Gold City Junction","Ooh! I was so mad when I got this set! If you look closely at the cannon on the front of the box, you can see it is one of the old &quot;shooter&quot; cannons. I thought &quot;cool, they're bringing them back!&quot; But alas, no, it must just be that they shot photos of the set in Europe (heavy sigh). This is an excellent introduction set to the Wild West theme. We're given two buildings, a mixture of town minifigs, a cannon, and a coach.
The buildings are a fair beginning for building a town: a bank and a general store. The store is made with the new &quot;log&quot; wall sections plus 1x2 and 1x4 molded &quot;log&quot; bricks. There are lots of supplies to go with the store including a shovel, pick, frying pan, and dynamite, one of the new large barrels and two small barrels (sorry folks, no lids). On the roof of the store, there is a place for the store marquee and this has a little 1x1 2-brick-high shutter on each side of the marquee (perfect for peeking out or ambushing the unsuspecting cowpoke). I'm not usually a sticker person, but the store window comes with a neat add-on sticker and the bank comes with two for the windows and one for the door. The bank also comes with some neat stuff including some hundred dollar 1x2 flats, 2x2 2-brick-high boxes with a new &quot;safe/vault&quot; print on the door of the box, a small room/vault to hold one of the safes and a blow-away wall (discussed below).
There is also a stage coach included with the set, although it is more of a cargo stage coach than for passengers. The rear section of the coach holds the strong boxes/safes from the bank and the interior of the coach includes one of the ejector pins for &quot;blowing&quot; the boxes out of the car (you'll have to buy a set to see how these ejectors are activated). My instructions came with an additional sheet of reprinted instructions for assembling the coach which includes an extra 1x1 flat stud to raise the ejector just the slightest bit. I'm guessing that the set was almost rushed out before they realized the ejector didn't quite blow out well enough without this extra flat stud. As assembled with the extra piece, the box blows out nicely (what, never heard of something blowing up nicely?). But the bank wall also includes one of these ejector pins and it doesn't blow out as well (the ejector knocks the wall out of place, but because of the size of the wall or for some other reason, the wall just lodges in place and never quite leaves the building). Now I'm wondering if there should have been an extra brick or two added to the assembly of the bank structure to make it work as well. As it is, I'm still trying some different combinations to see what will work (just called Shop at Home Consumer Affairs and they said they got the same results, I guess the diagrams themselves are what is misleading).
Minifigs include a bandit, a sheriff, two cowboys, a banker, and a soldier. I gotta say right here that I really like these new body prints; the sheriff has a big shiny star (so does his hat), the bandit looks good with or without his kerchief, and the banker has this nifty gold watch in his vest pocket, a pencil behind his ear, and hundred dollar bills stuffed in his other vest pocket (is this guy just asking for trouble or what?). There are plenty of the new rifles and six-shooters to go around for everybody.
Nifty/unique pieces include the 1x2 flat wanted poster for Flatfoot Thomsen, the window decals (high praise from a guy who usually tosses any and all stickers) and the new spring-loaded ejector pins.
Besides the flaw in the bank wall which I mentioned above, I was very pleased with this set. ♦♠",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-05-18T03:27:44.46Z","My best Western set...","This is probably the biggest and the best western set that I have. Surprisingly, this is the very first time that I will be giving 5/5 stars. If I could remeber it right, the other name of this set is Main Street. Anyway, this has a lot of neat stuff like the dollar bills and coins. It comes with 6 minifigs: 1 banker, 2 cowboys, 1 bandit, 1 soldier, and a store manager. The set is actually divided into 2: the bank and the store. Too bad, I lost the instruction booklet. I'll definitely have a hard time rebuilding this. By the way, there are also springs for the explosion mechanism which made this set really good. A perfect five for this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"sudorum","2008-05-04T16:01:45.513Z","A bank with high standards!","I'd have to say the best part of this set is the bank. On the inside are two safes, one located in the vault, and the other a part of the accountant's desk. The vault in the bank happens to have an exploding function. This works when the bandit inserts a stick of dynamite in the side of the building. The carriage also has an exploding function which ejects the safe from it. The general store is good too, but needs a little more items. My only complaint is that the set doesn't come with any gold, but this can be easily fixed. ",FALSE,5,4,5,4,5
"Crazybrick45","2009-06-20T19:23:10.28Z","A great Western set.","This set.. is just awsome. If you have the sheriff's office then you have a pretty big town that you can re-arrange however you want. It comes with 6 minfigs, 3 horses, LOADS of accesories.

Pros:
3 horses.
6 minifigs. 
Bench in front of the bank blows off when you insert a dynamite piece or dollar into it.
Loads of accesories like pistols, rifles, dollars, and gold.
Cannon fires!
Slanted roofs on both the bank and general store tilt up and down.

Cons:
Like... none. Except theres only 1 bandit, but you can easily take one from another set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-10T05:33:04.32Z","LEGO Wild West - Gold City Junction Review","I think this set is the 2nd coolest LEGO Wild West set which LEGO made. We get two buildings (a bank and a general store), a cannon which really shoots and a money wagon. This set includes a few stickers but they're still fun to put on.The built was a little bit long but it's a cool and fun built. The whole set is very sturdy. This set also comes with two rare minifigs like the cowboy with the brown pants and the banker. The wagon for the money looks very cool. There's a place on the top where you can put the minifig and there's also an awsome turret which sviwels. On each side of the wagon is a handle where you can put 2 more rifles. The storage containers can be opened on each side and you can see a piston. If you slide a stick of dynamite piece through you can see that the wall on the back is going to explode because the safe flies out of the wagon.<br><br>We get the same feature for the bank as well. The bank has a big sign on the top which is a stickers and the door and the window have stickers too. You can also see a reward sign in the front of the bank. The other building is the general store. Outside you can see a plant, a 'LEGOREDO' sign and a big keg where you can put a minifig in. Inside you can see lot's of weapons. You also get some money pieces, a calvary soldier, a criminal with a black horse, a sheriff and a cowboy with a white hat as a minifig. This set is a great set to have and I really can't complain about this set.<br><br>All

"whaleyland","2012-08-22T16:35:39.913Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: The Town that Goes Boom!","<p>
 At no point in LEGO&#39;s history prior to 1996 did it produce such an elegant and well-designed town as it did with Gold City Junction. This little treat does everything it advertises, and with the addition of the Sheriff&#39;s Lock-Up set, the town shines as a light to all other LEGO themes. But what makes this set so special, read on...</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Innovations: Just like the Bandit&#39;s Hide-Out set, this set uses many of the same &quot;explosion&quot; mechanisms that became central to the 1996 Western theme. In this case, though, LEGO put the detonation spots in two different locations: in the bank and on the carriage. The bank&#39;s explosion opens up the vault, catapulting a money chest into the road. The wagon&#39;s sweet spot is under one of its $ sign logos and explodes the back of the wagon off, sending another chest of money flying. Most of the set&#39;s action ends there, which is why this set doesn&#39;t get a 10/10 review, but there are other innovative parts, such as the raised floors off of the beige baseplates, and the excellently-done false fronts on the buildings. Even the roof of the General Store is done well, though later developments could have made it look much smoother.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Lack of Inspiration: This set exudes inspiration, but it still lacks in some specific areas. For one, it is a simple set. It takes up a lot of space, but is relatively simple with only a few gimmicks. Another thing to note is that almost all the people are copies of previous sets except for the general store owner and the banker. The addition of these two figures is significant, but it is unfortunate that no female figures were included in the 1996 line at all. Finally, I feel this set really needs a third building. For its price point, $49.99, it was a bit expensive and a third building such as a post office or a saloon, would have gone a long way to making this set perfect.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 What It Got Right: Still, the set got a lot right. There is money galore in this set, from bursting bank vaults to golden coins. It also included a canon and a sign that reads &quot;LEGOREDO&quot; suggesting that this town is beside Fort Legoredo, and also that this town may not actually be called Gold City. The inclusion of stickers for the signs and windows is extremely nice thematically, although printed bricks is always preferred. The instructions even included an insert that corrects a problem with the building of the wagon, which remains the only set I own that has a correction in it. Overall, the visual style of this set is amazing, even if the set is a bit expensive for what it includes.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Possible Improvements: With time comes improvements. The Western Town CUUSO set that has been proposed will basically be a masterfully enlarged version of this, with realism that wasn&#39;t even possible in 1996. If price were not an issue, this set could really use an additional building: the saloon. A western town without a saloon is lacking in authenticity. Additionally, the buildings could all use expansions and better inventories, and a stage coach would be very welcome. More varied minifigures would take the cake. And, of course, a real firing cannon since the US did not import firing cannon until 2008.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigure: This set included six minifigures, only one of which was a bad guy. He was Bandit #1, the leader of the pack, the all-black, brown-hatted man with a black bandana over his mouth. A good choice for the set, though a crony would have been nice to have on hand. To fight the bad guy, the set came with a single cavalry soldier with his blue kepi cat and uniform and white bandana. His face is the same as that used by Pirates seven years earlier. The sheriff is also included, keeping the peace in his dark gray shirt and black pants and a grey hat with a star on it. His face, too, has been used since the Pirate days. The fourth regular is our generic cowboy friend, wearing his leather vest over a red shirt and blue jeans, and wearing a white hat over his white hair. Nothing especially special about him since he was included in almost all of the 1996 Western sets. Now we meet our two new friends. First off we have the cowboy in a dark leather vest and blue shirt with brown slacks and a grey hat. His face is gruff because he means business, but he ain&#39;t a bad guy. Second up we have the banker, who is finely detailed with gold-rimmed glasses, a pencil over his right ear, a black vest with money in a pocket, and a pocket watch. His dark gray pants seem out of place in this otherwise finely detailed figure. As said earlier, a woman would have been nice in this set, as would another bad guy, but those will have to wait for a reboot of the series.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 How it Compares: Until another western-themed town comes out, this will have to be it. It is a wonderful set that gave me hours of playtime even if it was simple in many of its gimmicks. Combined with the other 1996 sets, it fits perfectly as the town center of a small boom town in the Wild West. I&#39;d recommend this set to anyone interested in the theme, although I wouldn&#39;t pay a fortune for it. I feel like it will be replaced sometime before long...</p>
<p>

 QUALITY SCORE: 9/10</p>
