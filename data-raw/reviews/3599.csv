Regardless, it still would have be worth the actuall price. This is a great set, as are most, if not all the Western sets.

6 minifigs (possibly the first human figs to not have the standard smiley template)

"mrmitch","2008-02-11T01:17:44.797Z","Big set = Big Fun : Indian Style","This set is awesome, its the biggest indian set in the Western theme. It comes with a total of 7 minifigures (one is the chief), two horses, a canoe, 2 tee pee's and lots of weapons &amp; extras. There is a full base plate with river printed on it and a full half sized base plate, you can join them with a few blocks in many different ways. I love this set it looks great and is a must for anyone who collects the Western themed sets. Once its together you can play with it for hours due to the size and different scenes you can create. Underneath the trap door is a large (cave) where the indian braves can hide out. The set is well worth the original price of $69.99. If you come across this set, its worth adding to your collection, #6766 is a five star set all the way. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

6766 Rapid River Village

This set was released in 1997, as part of the western theme, and indians subtheme. In 2002 this set was re-released as a classic set. And I consider it a classic, it is amazing in very much details. In a meeting of LUGBrasil I saw this set builted and played with it by some minutes. 

Of course, all the contents are useful, and this set have exactly 343 pieces. Also, it includes seven minifigures and two horses. The two horses are very different from the common horses of the castle theme (not in shape, in shape the horses are the same), because these have more details and different colors by extension. Both horses don't have the original black dots as eyes, that makes them different, but still good in playability and also in details.

Some minifigures are also a bit strange, because these don't have dots as eyes, too. And also, the faces are detailed with some facial paintings. At least the yellow original color scheme prevails, making these minifigures more classic. Of course, the minifigures and the horses are a bit different from the original (due to their details), but of course the quality, details and playability makes these still being considered as classics. 

The clothes and pants (bodies,arms and legs) of the minifigures are well detailed, too, and even useful. Some other contents like the large headdress with feathers (common among the indians subtheme, can illustrates very well the whole subtheme) and the long hair with headband can increase the minifigures to be more reallistic. 

Some other interesting contents are the minifig feathers, that can be fixed at the long hair with headband piece, and at spears or oars. And also, this set includes useful tools such as shields, longbows (with an arrow at its middle), spears, handaxes, arrow quivers, a horned helmet and more, to increase these seven minifigures included and anyother minifigure from the subtheme (indians). Also, it includes some snakes and birds (dark gray colored parrots).

The building isn't very complex, but somethings makes it more cool. This set isn't very hard to transport, you only needs to be cautious to the baseplates (two are 16x32 with Square Corners, and other is a 32x32 Road 7-Stud curve with blue and green river pattern)don't dismantle.

The main base is made by basically three baseplates, and the building comes up the base. The main tepee occupies a place with aprox. 16X16 studs, it is big enough to put more than just one minifigure. Each  tepee uses two brown pieces to support, and these are increased by cloth teepe covers (It have the same material from the common flags of the pirateships and other tepees). The set includes two cloth tepee covers, and both are very well detailed, though a bit simple, and both shows differences in the details. It makes the color scheme a bit colorful, of course, but it isn't a bad thing about the set, it is nice. 

The 32X32 base plate with river pattern have few buildings above, it have a teepe, two plant tree stumps increased by plants (these can store the weapons and other contents, like shields and arrow quivers), a 7X3 bar with double clips (that can be used as stairs, and can store some itens, too) connected at the base by two 1X1 tiles with clips. Also, this baseplate have some bricks making a place to put the fire piece and to put the saucepan. This part of the building is very basic, the other baseplate have more increasements. But this features a good space to put minifigures.

The other part of the building is a bit more complex, but not too complex. It have at a side a rock piece and other above, but both rock pieces have differences in shapes, one is more large and other is more tall. These rock pieces are increased by some 1X1 green bricks, and connects at the floor some pilars with a brown color scheme.  

The rock pieces are also increased by another 7X3 bar with double clips, in this case used as a stair. It shows a bit of a canyon likeness, that is very good, though simple. Above the brown pillars, few bricks makes two &quot;bird totens&quot;. The totens are simple, but the design is very cool and interesting. 

At the other side of the base plate, there is the other tepee, made just like the other tepee. But of course, this have different details in the tepee cover. More above the rock pieces, you can see at this level another building being made. A gray plate and some brown bricks makes a second floor, good to use as a siege tower. The tepees' covers don't dismantle easily, and this plate also have some black pieces and a fire accessory increasing it, at the side of the tepee.
  
The other baseplate shows a bit more complex building, but more complex in design than in building itself, due to the rock pieces. But it isn't bad at all, because these pieces are good to add more cool likeness in the design. 

This plate is almost completed all by some pieces making a structure of a indian outpost. This outpost (this is a part of the village) have some rock pieces at the sides, supporting all the other building, and some bricks &quot;help&quot; it. It is hard to dismantle, so, is very good.

It also have a river passing through it. The river is made by some blue bricks, plates, and three 6X8 slope bricks. These are big, and sometimes cut the use of the original plates with studs, but for this type of building it is good.

Some 2X10 gray bricks connects the rock pieces, making a place to a second floor. At a side, this outpost is also increased by a stair and a &quot;door&quot; (a passage) made by some black plates, being connected by a hinge plate 1X4 with a part that is also used to make car roofs.

Above the complex of the rock pieces and the gray bricks, there are some black plates making the second floor. It have a square shaped hole at a side, because it will later be a part of a trap. The second floor occupies a space like 16X13 studs, that is very good in terms of playability.

A 2X2 turntable plate connected under a small part of the second floor is also connecting a gray plate. This part is a small device, that can be used as a trap. If you turn tha plate to the right side, the black plate above will fall, and the pieces (or minifigure) above too. This trap is very simple but imaginative and well built, adding a great playability to the whole set. 

At the left side of the second floor, there is another rock piece, and another brown stair. It is like a small tower, just to make the set looks like better in design (and really, it is very good in design). It is also increased by a shield connected at a spear. But this rock pieces limits a bit more of the space of the second floor.    

At the other side of the second floor, there are some small brown bricks making a small wall. And also, above the river the second floor continues, expanded by more black plates. At this side (the right side if you see the curve of the river as the front), there is another rock piece, just to increase more the design. 

At the front of this piece, there is another trap, like the other in building, but this time the minifigure got by the trap will fall at the river. Very interesting use of the trap, a good idea without doubt. But at the front of this trap there are few more increasements, like a black slope piece (this pass above the river) and a plant piece, just to increase the design, at the front. Finishing the building of the second floor, it shows more few additions, like three cactus pieces and some trunks that can slide by the slope piece at the floor. 

Also, the second floor is increased by a multi colored toten, with shapes that resembles a bird and other two animals. These are very well made, though very basic and with various color schemes. It is a good detail to add in the subtheme.

The three baseplates can connect by some bricks. It is a bit hard to transport, but if you divide each plate, you can transport it easily without dismantle. 

The building with the instructions can be very easy, but not the alternate models, because these models don't have instructions showing how to make. But the image I saw at the back of the box shows a great building. Altough is hard to make that exactly building with this set, if you have this, you can make your own creation with this, of course.   

It is rare now, unfortunately for the fans of the classic sets, but you can find it by sites like Ebay and bricklink. In Ebay you can find a complete by $99,99 in USA and an incomplete by GBP20,00 that ships for UK. Searching in Bricklink, you can find a complete by $80,00, a bit cheaper price. If you search for the 6763 (the same set, re-released with another box in 2002) you can find a complete by $129,99. I think that the original, if in good condition, can worth more. 

Overall, the set worth the money, but if you find it even cheaper and easy to you, I strongly recommend. It is a classic set from the late 90's years that features a nice design and great playability. Of course, it have very useful contents (343 pieces). A 5/5 at all.
Hope you enjoyed the review! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-13T05:16:48.003Z","LEGO Western - Rapid River Village Review","This set is my second favourite set of the LEGO Western theme. We get 7 minifigs. One of them is the indian chief, one medicine man, two red indians, two tan indians and an indian female. I really enjoyed to build that model and I enjoy to play with it. It comes with two tepees which are made out of some kind of cloth material which is really cool. It has two campfires and I love the baseplate which has a river on it. It's a basic LEGO curve plate which we've seen in the old LEGO Town theme a lot. I also like the printed horses and the canoe and the log pieces where you can hide some weapons or some minifigs.<br><br>We also get an outpost and the bigger 'mountain' has some very cool play features. We get a ladder, a secret entrance to the cave, two trap doors and a feature where you can move the leaf to drop the logs to your enemies. It also comes with a cool looking totem. I really can't complain about this set and you won't have to complain about stickers as well.<br><br>All

"Fauch","2014-11-27T20:44:02.343Z","Good set","<p>This is a large set with quite a low pieces count. The prices appears to be a bit high compared to the piece count, though everything you need of the indian theme is in this set. Everything.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>That&#39;s a big pro for this set, there were very few indian sets, which means indian accessories are rare and this set has a lot of them. it comes with 3 baseplates, including a large printed one, it has teepees and hollow trees which are very rare, a canoe, tons of mountain panel (not sure any other set has more), a few large slopes, very rare horses, many bushes...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Another big pro, it comes with quite a decent number of minifigs, and they were very good for 1997. They have printed legs, and the chief with his printed headpiece could still compare to what lego makes today. The faces are also more detailled than what you were used to see in those days.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is not a hard one, there is lots of bigs pieces. It has many traps so it&#39;s quite fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This isn&#39;t the most impressive model, but it&#39;s ok. it&#39;s rather large. If you compare it to modern sets, it is big for a 350 pieces model. modern sets of 300 pieces appear to be 2 to 3 times smaller. You really get the whole indian experience with this set, it feels really complete without having to buy any other indian set, which, on the other end, may feel more like expansions to this set.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2020-04-02T17:48:29.027Z","a BURP and LURP -gasm","<p>I was 16 in 1997, and by then I had moved from regular LEGO towards LEGO technic and spending my days playing MK2 and 3 with my friends. I still eyeballed the regular LEGO sets in the catalogues, but being a teenager, I thought that these sets were for little kids instead of a 16yo...Oh how I was wrong! It was only years later, when I was a grownup, that I came to my senses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I always liked cowboys and Indians. It&#39;s a role-playing game I guess every kid plays when he or she is young. Shooting with your fingers at the other kids or running around tapping the palm of your hand on your mouth shouting: a-woe-woe-woe-woe-woe-woe-woe...because Hollywood had taught us that that was the way the Indians did it...oh how we were wrong - but that is a different story...</p>

<p>Needless to say that the Western theme was a theme I thought looked (and still looks) amazing and this set is no exception. The most stunning feature are the printed pieces. The quality of prints on the horses, shields, torsos, legs and faces was exceptional for the time. The level of detail is simply amazing. The horses are especially cool, because the prints on both sides differ! It gives them a more natural feel. Sure, the prints are pretty stereotypical and probably historically incorrect, but who cares. This is a toy, not a history-class.</p>

<p>The village is build on 3 baseplates: we get 2 tan&nbsp;16 by 32 plates (which give a good representation of a mid-west-dessert-like area) and one nicely printed 32 by 32 baseplate with a river printed in the corner. Makes sense: you would expect a village to develop itself nearby a river.</p>

<p>The actual village is rather small&nbsp;with only 2 teepees, but I&#39;m fine with that because both teepees are different in print. One teepee clearly belongs to the medicine man and one teepee belongs to the chief (seeing how the print on the teepees resemble the prints on their shields). Along with the teepees we get a couple of fireplaces, a rack for hides and weapons&nbsp;and some tree stumps for storage/hiding. It is all a bit sparse, but that&#39;s simply the way LEGO was back in the day: kinda &quot;less is more&quot;. I&#39;m okay with it, although the standard has changed by now.</p>

<p>The village is not only build near a river but also near a rocky outdrop which&nbsp;gives a nice representation of those typical mid-west desert mountain structures. This structure is quit large and creates a nice back and background for the village. It is constructed of a large number of BURPS and LURPS, used to a very good effect. I simply love these pieces! This set clearly shows the possibilities of these large pieces.&nbsp;Here bigger is actually better, an absolute BURP and LURP-gasm :D.&nbsp;<br />
On the ground floor we get a large cave with a secret entrance and a river-rapid connected seamlessly with the river printed on the baseplate. Only downside is that&nbsp;it is difficult to access the cave and that there is absolutely no interior whatsoever. Oh well, I will have to create it myself!<br />
On the first floor we get a nice totem pole, another fireplace, some snakes and some great play-features: trapdoors leading towards the cave and the river-rapid and a mechanism to drop some logs on&nbsp;innocent canoers passing by :D. TIIIIMMMMBBBEEERRRRR!!</p>

<p>The population of our little village consists of 7(!) Indians: a chief, a medicine man, a squaw and 4 Indian warriors. They are all armed to the teeth: spears, quivers, bows and axes, all decorated with feathers. As mentioned before these figs look stunning, with very beautiful printing and, as a unique feature, with noses :D!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh man, this set is brilliant, it is absolutely brilliant!</p>

<p>So why not 5 stars?</p>

<p>Well, I feel that there is something missing: bad guys!! I am missing 1 or 2 cowboys or cavalry soldiers to&nbsp;make everything make sense and come together! Why else the trapdoors? Why else the action feature to drop logs? You aren&#39;t going to drop them on your fellow Indians, or are you, you psycho :D?</p>

<p>So to make up&nbsp;for this, I got myself set nr 6716 covered Wagon. Yeah, now we are talking:&nbsp;the lonely soldier getting trapped by the Indians...will he make it out alive...will he be able to make a stand until reinforcements come in...</p>

<p>Euhm..sorry guys,...I have to start playing with my set...see you later :D</p>
