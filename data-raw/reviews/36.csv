This set had style. seriously what other ship in the fleet was trimed in gold? yeah none. This is the flagship, and it definatly was a legend.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-29T18:15:04Z","Awesome Ship","﻿One way I could tell that this set is so good is that I could change it around.  See, if I get another
set that I spot something I think could have been done better, I am not able to fix it, because I
need specific parts I don’t have, or because it wouldn’t be good size-wise, or, on the occasion
that I do change things around, the finished product only looks remotely like the set it came from! 
However, it’s not so with this.  I changed the winch around so it would be an actual winch, which
gave me a longer string for the anchor.  I switched around the chest in the cabin with a table and
chair, and it looks good.  I made a few other changes, such as switching out the sword-barrel with
a rum-keg, but you can’t tell right away that the ship is slightly different.

I love this set.  This has decks,
hatches, doorways, et cetera.  The schooner is basically a cannon-tub in between the aft cabin and
the front deck.  But I like both of their looks.  They're too different to compare.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Lots of things to play with (hoist, captains cabin, hidden hatches, etc). My only regret is that they did not include the shooting cannons that with the original European 6285 set.

Either way, a very nice set and highly playable.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-31T15:44:15Z","Great set!","I got this for Christmas and I really like it.  Great parts  and so many different possibilities for alternate models. I do have two minor complaints though:
1. The instruction were not the best I've seen.  Some parts were confusing and it was easy to miss pieces.
2. The crane does not work.  But this is a very easy fix.
Overall a very good set worth the $100 and the trouble trying to get it. (Sadly, at this time, S@H did not have any left in stock)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-16T16:49:32Z","Very cool ship!!!","When I first got this set two years ago it was better then I ever thought it would be. It comes with 8 minifigures, a reasonable amount of cannons, a large captain's cabin,a place to keep prisoners below deck, a rowboat, an anchor, lots of tresure and weapons, and lets not forget the monkey and the parrot. This has to be one of the best pirate ships ever made!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-18T16:38:44Z","A great ship!","Good work, LEGO! Another classic LEGO set released! Well, it hasn't same pieces as the orginaly ship from 1989, but these changes can't be see, with the exceptions from the cannons that could't be fired anymore. Thats why I'll give it a 9, but still a good set! The changes are, with the exceptions of the cannons: No minifigures stud stolid heads. For the second: No orginaly sails that you must sut in the middle of them. The theird: No orginaly instructions. And for the fourth: No orginaly box.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T04:36:14Z","It's so cooooooooooooooooool","This is a very cool Pirate ship but i still don't no who the captain is: Roger or Redbeard? I think Roger cause Red beard has a ship called RED BEARD runner. But this ship is 10x better than the Red Beard runner! Cause the bsb has much more detail than all other PIRATE ship but the Imperial ships haves also much detail: The Imperial flaghship haves some thingy so you can turn the reer when you turn the wheel! But this feature prevents you from using the cabin. So Black seas Barracuda is the best of all!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-26T11:23:02Z","Some parts not made same, but not really noticeable.","  I never got the original Black Seas Barracuda, so I got the legend.  I notice that some things are not made the same as in 1989, though- no solid stud heads, the tube on the crate is made diffenent than from the 'old' tubes and the swords were slightly diffent then, the sails are made different, also no firing cannons.  But other than that it's the same from from what I can tell. Good set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
