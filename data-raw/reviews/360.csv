This is a boxy little racer built in perfect minifig scale. The #2 bricks and tile are great details. The minifig included is awesome and the directions call for pieces that are very easy to find in many colors. I used the directions from this set to create a rival &quot;Number 3&quot; racer. Check it out at my brickshelf gallery:

The headlights are an awesome part of this set because it makes it a real rally car. The spoiler is pretty sick too. 5 out of 5 for an outstanding set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
