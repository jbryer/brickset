TLC really messed up on the stars and bars/stripes that show ranking on the shirts of the soldiers. No set has ever had more weapons of any kind. Oh well, this set is definetly deserving of a ten, would have rated it thirteen (If I could), but those problems subtract two to three points, so I'm happy with a ten. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-15T12:10:08Z","&#240; Fort Legoredo! &#240;","This set is a gem in the LEGO universe, with several new pieces, great versatility, and great possibilities. 
The set separates into four sections, which can be reconnected in many ways, either to make a different or better fort, or just to get in there and play with it easier. I keep mine the same as it is in the instructions. 

The most notable section is the back wall, or that with the Headquarters, jail cell, and “stable”. Inside the Headquarters, there are two chairs and a circular table. If the table is rotated in one direction, the floor beneath one of the chairs will fall, and the former occupant of the seat will decend to the room below him, and not in a very graceful manner. This mechanism is rigged underneath both of the two chairs. If the man in the chair near the door falls, he will land in the “stable”. If the man in the other seat falls, he lands in the jail! Neat trick. The thing I don’t like about the back section is that a horse can’t fit in the stable without having to bend his neck downward (which, as I happen to know, makes the horse’s neck extremely loose and squeaky). 

The set is just plain impressive. The size was one thing that got me excited about it, and the fact that it could open up just like the older Castle sets could (before those silly mountain baseplates came out). The horns on the rooves look sort of goofy, but it’s easy to take them off. I like the Union Army minifigures a lot more than the figures from the pirate sets. It’s good that the soldiers have a way to get up to the catwalks, in the form of a ladder or two, which increases it’s playability. All of the ceilings open up, which also increases the set’s playability. This set is especially good in conjuction with the 1997 sets 6706 Frontier Patrol and Weapons 6716 Weapons Wagon. 

All in all, this set is great, complete with good-guys, bad-guys, locking doors, and trap-doors (a LEGO classic).

This set is not only 4-sided, it has LOTS of room &quot;inside&quot;. 10 figures, plus a cannon is also great, and because the figures are special cowboy ones, it makes the set even better.

"petro17sq","2008-09-07T06:47:53.92Z","Amazing set!","I wanted to get one of this a long time ago, I even have bought 6706 Frontier Patrol some years ago to complement the Fort Legoredo because I knew that I will get it the future , but this set was to expensive in e-bay or Bricklink, finally last week I got one in e-bay for only 20 pounds!
Last night I finish the construction of the fort and I am very impress with the result.
The set is huge, much bigger that expected, it is divided in four wall, all of them very nice, of course the back wall with the headquarters is the best one, with the office that have a clever mechanism to send a minifigure to the prison cell or to the stable, it also have some nice place to hide Lego coins.
I also like the front wall with the Fort Legoredo advert and the two tall towers.
It came with 10 excellent minifigures 3 bandits and 7 officials the only problem is that the set has to many spaces to put minifigures so my task right now is to found extra minifigures for the set.
It also has 3 horses, one with a cool carriage for the canon.
Initially this was the only western set I wanted to buy, but now I want all the western sets, that is the problem with Lego one you begin with a theme you want all the other sets to complemented the one you have.
In conclusion a great 5 out of 5.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-03T04:48:19.74Z","LEGO Western - Fort Legoredo Review","Now this is one of my favourite LEGO sets I own. It has so many playabilities and so many minifigs (It comes with 10 minifigs in total). You can't really complain about this set - even if it comes with a few stickers. I'm sure that this set had been so successful that this had to be rereleased in 2002. It also has some nice rare pieces like the golden trumpet.<br><br>We get a wagon with a canon which really shoots, an office for the calvary chief which has a table with two chairs and a card game. If someone is cheating you can sviwel the table and the figure is falling into the jail or into a corridor where he can escape. This set comes with a box where you can hide a rifle, three outposts and a huge balcony where the guards can guard the fort. I love the design of that model and it's lot of fun to build and play with this set.

"whaleyland","2012-08-30T13:10:38.223Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: A LEGO Frontier Fort on the Streets of Laredo","<p>
 Every good guy playset theme needs a base just like every bad guy needs a base, and so the LEGO Cowboys got Fort Legoredo, an obvious mixture of concepts relating to the Indian wars forts that littered the western United States, LEGO, and the stereotypical western town of Laredo drawn from the Lonesome Dove series which had a television series running at the time this set was released.</p>
<p>
 Innovations: With extensive use of the &quot;log cabin&quot; walls and bricks, this set is a visually magnificent portrayal of a small western fort. Unlike castles in the Castles series which neglect many important aspects of a castle&#39;s design, this fortress includes quite a bit. As innovations, there unfortunately is not too much. Trap doors in the Headquarters building allows either a guest to fall into a prison cell or the general to escape. Hidden treasure caches are nothing new but there are a few of them littered throughout the place. Otherwise, the set is pretty predictable.</p>
<p>
 Lack of Inspiration: That predictability actually limits the play value of this set compared to many of the other Westerners sets. With no explosive slots, the bad guys have to unrealistically siege the fort with just their pistols and ineffective TNT. Even the cover of the box shows the futility of this. The set also only comes with one cannon, and only allows cannon slots on one side of the fortress. As one last impossibility, there is a not-at-all secret exit to the fort just behind the Headquarters building, which rather limits the importance of the grand front entrance. This set relies on many minifigures to carry its play value.</p>
<p>
 What It Got Right: Visual grandeur, therefore, is what this set is going off of. With the wood walls, it looks great and definitely feels like a frontier fortress. Best of all, there is little to contradict that. The set looks as rugged as LEGOs can really get, with rock outcrops popping in, and cow&#39;s horns on the roof. Even a small chimney and fireplace in the Headquarters building. The simple use of stickers to label different parts of the set seem natural and thematic, and the extra little details such as the sage grass are simply excellent. While the set lacks a lot of interaction, it has a lot going for it that pleases the eyes.</p>
<p>
 Possible Improvements: Were this set to be released today, I&#39;d assume it would use fewer pre-built wood wall panels. This set is heavy on them and, while it often looks good, I feel that purpose of the cannon is fairly simple. Perhaps a larger set would be nice too. Not overly large, but a little more detail such as a soldier&#39;s barracks, or a blacksmith shop, or even just a kitchen would be nice. More gimmicks would improve the playability, and a larger variety of troops with different facial expressions would go a long way to making this set unique. Otherwise, it does a great job at being a fort.</p>
<p>
 Minifigure: Ten minfigures are included in this set, but only one hasn&#39;t been seen before. Let&#39;s start with him. The cavalry colonel has darker detailing than the lieutenant, with slightly bulging buttons on his blue chest piece. A prominent &quot;US&#39; is stamped on his belt. He has stars on his collar and a cavalry symbol on his hat. His face is probably meant to look a bit like General Custer&#39;s, which it succeeds in doing with a bit of flourish. Two cavalry lieutenants are included, with their usual grey scruffy face and blue cowboy hat. One has a white bandana while the other does not. Similarly, three cavalry soldiers are included, wearing their kepi hats. One of the three is missing his white bandana. A generic red cowboy with a brown vest and white at comes with the set, probably as a militiaman from the nearby town. All three bad guys of the Westerners line come with this set as well, though what they&#39;re going to do is beyond me. Bandit 1 has his usual black fa&ccedil;ade. Bandit 2 is angry with missing teeth and a red shirt. Bandit 3 is greedy for gold in his top hat and green blazer. No real surprises from these figures, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
 How it Compares: This set compares better to castle sets than Westerners sets. As a Westerners set, it is entirely unique and looks amazing. It has few features, but looks that part of a frontier fortress protecting the nearby town from Indian attacks. Those attacks would have to wait until 1997, though, leaving the purpose of the fort in 1996 a little in question. Compared to castles, it is alright but nothing great. Other castles have included more gimmicks, more details, and more value for your money. Overall, this set is only somewhere near the top-middle of LEGO fortresses. But if you have a desire to build a Western town, this set is a must and I highly recommend it nonetheless.</p>

"The_Stig2","2009-12-24T10:52:23.687Z","A love story thirteen years long...","I've craved the Fort Legoredo set since it came out back in 1996, but at the time it was too expensive and so I had my parents buy me the Bandit's Secret Hideout (the gold mine) instead. But I didn't stop dreaming the Fort at all...
Yesterday, more than 13 years after I first fell in love with the Legoredo, I finally got it thanks to a close friend who knew how much I wanted this set. After so much time, even if I'm a tad too old for Legos, it's like a dream coming true.
Fort Legoredo is an amazing classic Lego set, probably one of the best ever made; it's big, there's plenty of minifigs (even if they could have put an extra bandit), you get two large entrances, sturdy walls and a handful of interesting traps and hiding places.
The front part is great: there is the main gate watched over by the two (small but nice) red roofed towers. The rear part is the most interesting, with the headquarters building which includes a prison, a vintage-looking stable (that reminds me the old great castle sets of the 80s) and a spacious room with two armchairs that can become dangerous traps. The west side features another entrance and a watch tower that could have been better: in my Fort I turned this into another tower like the ones over the main gate, and I think it looks great now. The east side is a simple but nice wall on which guards can walk to oversee the area.
As a conclusion, Fort Legoredo is an amazing and versatile set, an instant classic which can give hours and hours of great fun. Just get one, you won't be disappointed even if you're not young anymore. 5/5

Pros:
- nearly everything, cons are small and unimportant

Cons:
- the watch tower on the west wall can be nicer
- just three bandits against seven soldiers

<p>This set contains a massive amount of large pieces. What stands out the most may be the big amount of 6x6 wooden panels (23!). It also has many large doors, 2 big barrels, 4 baseplates. Though the parts tend to be very repetitive, it is mostly brown log bricks.</p>
