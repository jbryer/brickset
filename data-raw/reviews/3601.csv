","When you really think about it, these figures aren't so flashy when compared to some other figures these days, but they're so rare and cool.  I think the cart is a nice touch even though it's rather plain, and it also comes with those 1x1 cylinders with the stud on top! 

It took me 3-4 years of checking at ebay to get this set, and it was worth the wait.  This set is better than all the minifig sets I have ever seen that followed.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The minifigures however are excellent, and the heraldry of these figures never appeared in any other set (though they could be ordered through the mail back in the day).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is now very rare and highly sought after.

Compared to newer sets the cart is primitive but functional, the men have the classic smiley face which matches well with the simple herarldry.  

A similar figure pack now would fly off the shelves.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Four of the minifigures have little differences, and the another two that carries the cart too, to each other. The two helmets styles are great, and the set is colorful. The cart have old wheels, but no wheels form a castle theme, these looks like be from city ones. The number of six minifigures is a beginning to make more fun with lego. I rate the knight's procession 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Freezdried","2010-01-28T12:33:26.42Z","Hey look! Rubber tires!","This is a great example of designing something using only the parts you have available.  The mini-figs are great.  The shield design is simple yet effective, and these knights would not seem out of place if lined up with the later ones.  But, what's with the cart?

I've got to hand it to the Lego design team - they weren't afraid to make things look absurd.  Rubber tires on red wheels, with lattice fences on the cart.  A little strange, yes?  At least the tires were the knobby ones, and not the smooth ones that were common at the time.  Still, I imagine the design team had limited resources, and had to make use of existing bricks, instead of designing new medieval ones.  So, hats off to you guys!  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-06-02T18:20:26.703Z","Six Classic soldiers and a cart.","<p>Overall 5 bricks : Why 5 bricks for 6 minifigures and a cart ? Simply because it is the first Castle battlepack, the finishing touch in the Classic Castle theme, because of the beautiful simplicity&nbsp;and effectivity of the cart&nbsp;and because of the great minifigures. And a lot of original owners must have felt the same since there are still great looking sets including instructions available for collectors like me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : The only small thing to built is the cart and since that is very easy 3 bricks is sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : The 5 bricks here are mostly for the minifigures. Six great looking Kinghts with nice weapons and&nbsp;I love the simplicity of the weapon on the shields and torso's. The rubber tyres of the cart seem strange but Lego had no other wheels available yet in those days. The parts of the cart are basic but well chosen, no treasurebox yet but bricks as treasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : certainly in the late seventies this set has great playability and still has, thanks to the good content.&nbsp;And the playing effect grows when you put this set together with either of the 2 other Classic Castle sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value&nbsp;5 bricks : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=677-1"">Bricklink</a> shows an average of some â‚¬35,00 for this set and in good condition it is defenitly worth it, esspecially for a Castle collector.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"rab1234","2018-07-13T17:59:27.223Z","Fantastic Knights","<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>This is a great army building pack and one of the only ways to get knights until the mid 80&#39;s.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to find 6 complete sets + some spares soldiers in a recent bulk purchase and, having had one as a kid, I was pretty excited to see an additional 40 knights with their trademark light gray swords and axes. The cart is very primitive and doesn&#39;t look medieval at all, but that&#39;s not enough to detract from the overall rating of 5 stars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>In my opinion, this is a pretty poor cart to go with some awesome knights.&nbsp; The only thing keeping this from being 1 star is that I&#39;ll consider building the knights and arming them as part of the build.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty satisfying seeing them all come together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Excellent soldiers, weapons, helmets, and shields.&nbsp; It did always bother me that the Axe soldiers had dark gray helmets instead of light gray like the others, but I&#39;m not going to deduct a star for my own OCD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>A great army builder.&nbsp; Just one of these sets would be sufficient to mount an attack on https://brickset.com/sets/375-2/Castle</p>

<p>Even on their own, this would offer tons of playability for a very low cost.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know the original cost, but I&#39;m assuming something like $5.&nbsp; Given that the sets go for around $30 in used condition now, this would have been a great buy back in the day.&nbsp; Even at $30 today, I don&#39;t think this is a bad deal. Consider that a collectable series minifigure goes for $4 today, so paying $5 per knight with a cart and instructions thrown in isn&#39;t too pricey.</p>

"mediAFOL","2022-02-04T14:53:36.91Z","The original battle-pack","<p>If this set from soon after the dawn of the minifigure era hardly merits great discussion, that should not diminish its importance and appeal. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57574"">Yellow Castle</a> had been extremely generous with its minifigs, but the chance to add more numbers to the four houses from that peerless set was a joy.</p>

<p>Others have mentioned before the appeal of Classic Castle packaging, and this is a prime example. The charming new yellow faces were shown off to such great effect by the cheerful sunny, greenery-bedecked boxes. The whole set simply makes one smile.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/knightsProcession.jpg"" style=""width: 824px; height: 662px;"" /></p>

<p>The main criticism of this set is that the same heraldic designs from the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57574"">Yellow Castle</a> were not used here. Those designs are so nostalgic and evocative, while those from this set fall a little short of that high standard.</p>

<p>But a first Classic Castle cart and an admittedly small company of knights cannot but be a wholehearted success.</p>
