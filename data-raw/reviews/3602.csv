"SweetBoy","2005-08-04T07:44:42Z","All about the Light and Sound","The drawback of the light and sound sets is the sheer size and weight of the battery unit. This set is a very simple lead vehicle and trailer whose sole purpose is to house the main unit. The varied colour lights and the space siren (different to the town siren) were the reason for buying the set and were wholly satisfactory but it was disappointing that more was not done with these tools.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-03-21T02:39:35.373Z","Serves its purpose.","This set is a jointed vehicle, the front half a moon buggy for pulling around....a battery box, by the looks of it.  Though this set looks quite nice, has that great Futuron colour scheme and a lot of useful pieces, it's the kind of set people buy for the light-and-sound unit rather than because it's a good set.  The design needs work.  I'm not quite sure what purpose that webbed radar dish serves, but the astronaut is constantly almost underneath it!  Still, it's an okay set if nothing special.
