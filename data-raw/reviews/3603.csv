<p>Anyhoo - I perhaps overrated this set compared to some other reviews, but I am thinking of it from a different angle by how it fits in with the other anti-Alpha Team set.</p>
<p>The only minor issue that I found was that the design and build were faily basic.&nbsp; The pluses outweigh this though:</p>
<p>-You get the main baddy, Ogel! (Lego backwards....huh)</p>
<p>-Ogel has a cool gold-plated visor a la Cobra Commander&nbsp;that covers up his&nbsp;James Bond villain-ish mug. Helmet attachment is original as well.</p>
<p>-Alpha Team series was big on those cool flames coming out of the exhaust - great effect.</p>
<p>-Good&nbsp;colour scheme&nbsp;and nifty&nbsp;transparent pieces to boot!</p>
<p>-This vehicle fits nicely into the riverway slot on the command center. DING DING DING!</p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed the Alpha Team series.&nbsp; I think I had all of the first wave minus maybe one set.&nbsp; I loved that they were individualized by names and the vehicles were well thought-out, original, and that the overall concept of these two organizations foiling eachother at every turn makes me hope that they bring the series back soon. They were all great builds.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T15:18:23.23Z","Ogel is Cheap","<p>Set #6771 Ogel Command Striker: The Alpha Team's hated enemy has his own private vehicle. Well, I'm not sure if he's hated, perhaps strongly disliked would be more friendly a term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ogel Command Striker is a small cheap model featuring one lone Mini-Figure, the Evil Lord Ogel, in his original two handed version. The vehicle is built using standard and perhaps not-so-standard pieces in a mixture of red, black, gray and transparent orange. It is a small vehicle and unfortunately some of the pieces are quick to detach during play sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set was good in that it allowed you to get Ogel cheaply, but a little on the dissapointing side because it used so few pieces, and some of the parts enjoyed detaching from the main model while playing with it. And yes, I know I'm repeating myself, but these facts deserve repeating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd still recommend this set for collectors who want to have Lord Ogel without the hook hand at a discount price. Had I thought more about it before ridding myself of this set I might have held off and perhaps offered it up for sale, as it stands it is gone now, hopefully being enjoyed by a child in this big wide world. but at 4$ US... According to this site, you really can't go wrong with it. (I believe it cost 7$ CND.)</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-23T07:51:24.91Z","Ogel should talk to his minions, get himself a new Command Striker","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">At the turn of the millennium, Lego had lots of sets that I lusted over in the catalogues as a kid with no money &ndash; Adventurers, Rock Raiders, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Alpha Team.&nbsp; Hell, I even wanted the Belville sets if only for the baseplates.&nbsp; I never got the big sets as my mum could never afford it so I had smaller sets, at most the mid-range ones.&nbsp; But one thing I appreciated is that most of the time, the small sets had enough going to keep a child like me going for hours and hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">My only contact with Alpha Team was seeing the PC game through a video/demo on a Lego Software CD I got with something in the early 2000s.&nbsp; I loved the look of the game, and I wanted to play it badly.&nbsp; I never saw the sets in store and by that time, I&rsquo;d moved away from Lego bricks to Bionicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As I&rsquo;ve returned to Lego post my Dark Age, I&rsquo;ve been buying sets that I might have bought if I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into Bionicle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m buying the sets I might have bought with more money, with more disposable income and if I&rsquo;d seen it on shelves here down under.&nbsp; And now that I have disposable income and a fleeting sense of responsibility, I decided to dive in and check out the Alpha Team with the Ogel Command Striker.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You won&rsquo;t be doing any sort of complicated building here, no studs on the side, sideways or modular building.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a simple bottom to top build, nothing out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Whole thing comes together in about two minutes and you&rsquo;re left with evil villain Ogel and his Command Striker craft.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ogel looks great.&nbsp; I love his armor piece and the gold visor, even if the armor is just from the UFO line, and the gold visor from the Space Port helmets.&nbsp; He looks suitably evil and menacing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Command Striker itself looks really nice when finished &ndash; the trans-red dish provides a lovely accent, while the greys and reds provide a nice contrast against the mainly black build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">My problem with the build is this:&nbsp; it&rsquo;s just not structurally sound.&nbsp; Humour me for a bit as I try to explain this set through textual explanation.&nbsp; Maybe go and look at the instructions for this next bit, I&rsquo;ll wait here.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">So, there&rsquo;s a light grey 1x6 plate which goes between those two red wedges (let&rsquo;s call them pontoons).&nbsp; But the grey plate isn&rsquo;t attached to the top black wedge plate at all, it&rsquo;s simply there to attach the two red pontoon pieces and space them apart.&nbsp; The black wedge which holds the majority of the Command Striker actually sits atop these two 1x 6 black bars, connected to the studs/holes on the bars.&nbsp; That all then sits on top of the red wedge/pontoon pieces.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">What all of this means is that nothing is really holding the model together on the bottom half, or at least making a solid brick to brick connection. &nbsp;If you press down on the wedge, the black bars bend, the pontoons will bend and then the grey plate pops up and off. &nbsp;And once that pops off the bars can barely support the top, the whole thing becomes shaky and wobbly and falls apart.&nbsp; It means you can&rsquo;t really push down at all on the top piece, limiting the play options.&nbsp; And it means you basically have to rebuild the entire bottom section if it falls apart.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You would have thought Lego might have thought to stabilise the Command Striker by including some more grey plates or a wedge piece or two &ndash; what&rsquo;s two small pieces in the parts budget of a set?&nbsp; I had to remedy this structural problem with some smaller light grey plates to connect the grey plate to the black bit to the pontoons.&nbsp; Once you get a connecting between the top black bit and the grey 1x6 plate, it&rsquo;s rock solid.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I know I&rsquo;ve been going on about this but it&rsquo;s really quite a major flaw, especially with the small size of this model.&nbsp; The fact it can barely hold itself together is quite a major stumbling block for this little thing.&nbsp; Not to mention those two pole like laser guns aren&rsquo;t attached to anything as well, so one wrong touch and they&rsquo;re coming off. It&rsquo;s easily remedied by adding some bricks from your own collection.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Honestly, this set isn&rsquo;t too crash hot for parts.&nbsp; You get some red wedge pontoon pieces, the trans-red radar dish which is good.&nbsp; The black wedge piece is always nice for plane models, robots, spaceships, etc. &nbsp;A lot of the pieces are just too small, too fiddly and too specialised for use. &nbsp;The one bit about this set I really like is that you can get the main villain of the Alpha Team line, Ogel, for pretty cheap as I believe the only other set from the 2001 Alpha Team line that Ogel comes in is the Ogel Control Centre</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Once it&rsquo;s all put together, you&rsquo;ve got a little riverboat-esque vehicle which you could use to terrorise the rivers and oceans of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">But, of course, that&rsquo;s just what Lego suggests.&nbsp; I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be Ogel driving around on this little Command Striker.&nbsp; It could be your minifigures taking it for a spin.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s a space vessel and the red pontoons are anti-gravity emitters.&nbsp; Or maybe it&rsquo;s a river racer, or some kind of ferry.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re limited to mainly vehicle based ideas with this set as there&rsquo;s nothing else save Ogel and his craft.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I think this set should have included something else for Ogel to interact with.&nbsp; Maybe a storage container and some gems, an Ogel skeleton minion, one of the Eye of Ogel orbs from the main Control Centre build or even a bit of terrain. &nbsp;Something to incite the imagination.&nbsp; Just having the vehicle means you&rsquo;re kind of limited to vehicle based play.&nbsp; I think every set aside from the Ogel Control Centre in the Alpha Team 2001 line was vehicle base, with no landscapes, buildings or base. &nbsp;It also fits nicely into the Ogel Control Centre if you have that set!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I paid about $15 Australian dollars for this set and I don&rsquo;t think this set is worth that much at all.&nbsp; There just aren&rsquo;t enough pieces or play features to justify this price and for $15 dollars you can get lot better on eBay or Bricklink.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I think all up, this is an okay set.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very good, but it&rsquo;s not one of the worst sets around.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s below average really.&nbsp; For what you get, you get a nifty watercraft which, with some improvement, can become even better.&nbsp; You can get the villain of the Alpha Team lineup without having to go purchase the biggest possible set.&nbsp; You get a cool looking minifigure and some cool coloured pieces for your own constructions like the trans-red dish</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">But the fact that the set has poor structure, a lack of overall useful parts and nothing else to interact with means you don&rsquo;t really have a lot of options with it.&nbsp; I feel like Ogel really needed something to work with, he needed a weapon or a storage container or even a cheap minion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you see it cheap or you want Ogel for your Lego displays, get it, but don&rsquo;t break your bank for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
