I like this set because of the radar, the wings, the cockpit, well pretty much all of it. I don't really like Radia, but she is part of the alpha team.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But I remade it once and had a blast with it. Its playability rate is very high, and the number of cons is very low.
 
                     *PROS*
                    (Great design

                     none. zip. nada.

                On a scale of 1 to 5, this set deserves a 6. I highly recommend this set to anyone.

"BobaFett2","2010-09-30T08:41:56.187Z","Cool set and design, a bit bland","This is an Alpha Team set, one of the original 4/5 ones released in 2001 on the Alpha Team faction's side.<br><h4>Building Experience and Playability<br></h4>The build is a bit bland, as to be expected with a limited number of parts. It can pretty much be seen how to build this from the pictures. As for playability, not much on it's own-it's swooshable, but it's best with more sets.<br><h4>Parts and Price</h4>There's some good parts in this set, such as the engine pieces, the cockpit front, and the fins. The purple parts are quite rare in that color, so that's useful. For the price of $7.50, it's a bit expensive, but it's better than other sets of that time.<br><h4>Overall</h4><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Purple Pieces</li><li>Cool parts</li><li>Alpha Team Outfit</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Not a lot of parts</li><li>Basic Build</li></ul>Because this is an Alpha Team set, I rate it a four because of color scheme and parts. I recommend this set to those collecting Alpha Team, as it is a lot cooler than many other sets from the theme from later years. It's also a nice set in terms of being ""pre-space"" but ""post-modern""-that is: it's futuristic, but not to the point of wide space-travel.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T15:32:07Z","Cruise in Search of Ogel's Secret Base","<p>Set #6772 Alpha Team Cruiser: If memory serves Alpha Team is the first Theme to include miniature comics in the back of the instruction booklets. (I could be wrong, Bionicle may have been the first, but then again Bionicle's comics were seperate from the main instructions.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first year of Alpha Team introduced us all to the many characters serving the Alpha Team in order to prevent the LEGO Universe from being destroyed by the sinister Lord Ogel. The Models all had uniform looks and coloring and unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your preference, stickers for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AT Cruiser is the first set for the Alpha Team, it is the smallest price range set as well and features the female team member Radia. With large powerful looking engines and an impressive radio detection dish (or possibly laser artillery weapon.) the vehicle coasts over the oceans in search of Ogel's hidden base. With easy to follow instructions and a fast, fun build the AT Cruiser looks great on the shelf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this part of the comic story followed after the Ogel Command Striker's comic story, you see each instruction book featured a small comic story with cute and funny illustrations, but more importantly all of them featured a continuous story from one comic to the next. I believe the storyline starts in the Ogel Command Striker's comic, it continues with the AT Cruiser comic, then went to the AT Helicopter, the AT ATV and then the last two parts were told in the largest sets. (Which I didn't own.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last time Ogel, in his Ogel Command Striker, detected the presence of Radia and raced out of his secret base to confront her. Radia, being attacked suddenly, tangled with Ogel and crashed on the island where his hidden base was, then she radioed for help and we follow the story in the next instruction book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that aside, the set is a great looking piece with some fun pieces and powerful looking engines. Radia, being an Alpha Team Mini-Figure, is quite unique looking. It's just a shame that LEGO didn't include a second head piece of purple colored hair to go with her. It would have meant getting a unique colored hair piece with a Mini-Figure instead of just the generic white hat that she came with. (Since she had purple bangs printed on her head she must have purple hair.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend this set to fans of LEGO's more unusual and exciting Themes, Alpha Team, Agents, Adventurers to a lesser degree. The set is cheap, it features a unique mini-figure and a well designed open aired vehicle with some great pieces.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Lego_fan_","2019-12-30T18:03:11.253Z","Fun little build.","<p>Construct 6772 Alpha Team cruiser from the classic Lego theme Alpha Team. This set includes a female minifigure&nbsp;named Radia&nbsp;who looks very cool and yet creepy in my opnion. The boat or ship (not quite sure which) is of a small size about 4 inches long (including the flame on the back). It is equipped with a possible&nbsp;laser cannon on top, and four others on the wing and engines. I really love the function where you can pose the wings to look however you want. overall i think this set is very cool and is a must have for any Alpha Team or just Lego collectors in general.</p>
