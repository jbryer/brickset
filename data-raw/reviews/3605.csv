Nice sleek design, and to end that hair color thing down at the bottom of the page, IT'S BROWN! Not too many of any kind of piece to be good for getting in bulk, but there are some good trans green pieces",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T21:44:55Z","Good old Dash!","      This set is an ultimate and automatic 10 because it holds Dash, my favorite minifig!!!! Dash is ofcourse wearing his Alpah team garb an his unique brown hair piece. He also drives the Alpha Team spycopter. It has the most dopey controls in the helicopter but you can just replace them like &quot;snap&quot;! The only slight problem is that Dash sometimes is too tall for the cockpit and his big hair keeps the canopy from shutting fully. The helicopter has some cool radar things and a &quot;gun&quot; connected by gears. The rotors are neon green advanced blades and use a differant, more loose swinging connector to spin more swiftly. This helicopter also has a rope with a hook, with the skinny helicopter landing gear. It also has a long stretcheria and a cool tail-end part with a jet piece and tail fins. This is awesome, such a differant helichopper. Get it! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

How is he supposed to stear the helicopter without that?
In my opinion, this is one of the coolest Alpha Team sets i bought.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I just loved this set!(If only I could say the same about the Agents sets) I remember me wanting this set so bad, then going to Target to buy it. I remember the anticipation and excitement.

"jjr","2009-04-12T10:38:36.827Z","my first alpha team set!","when I was a kid I, my grandparents always bought together with me something. mostly lego's. afcourse not to expensive sets ;) When I saw this new theme I really wanted this one. now on to the pros and cons.

pros

it's really cheap for a good lego set
you get the leader of alpha team, dash
cool color scheme
good playability (however it could have included a small ogel vehicle)
not to many stickers
comic!! I really loved those at that age

cons

cheap, not in money but in parts. many over juniorized pieces
really easy build
looks kinda small, but I don't know the price anymore so that has not to be a con

overal

a really cool AT vehicle, it's cool but comparerd to todays sets it's kinda small. still if you want to buy some alpha team sets you have to get this one!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's sturdy, it has a good color scheme, And it comes the best Alpha team agent of all time. Dash! It has 2 laser machine guns up front, a sonic gun located on the side, and a electric gun on the side. Inside the cockpit we find Dash sitting at a printed control panel. Along with some super binoclars. And in the back you will notice a fine rope and pulley system. Perfect for taking Ogle out of the picture. The only annoying thing in the set is that time works against it. The rotor blades can't work anymore because they are so loose. But if you can find a nice sturdy version of this copter it will a wonderful edition indeed. Oh and I know his name is not James Dash! Its Dash Justice.<br>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T15:51:50.783Z","Dash Soars through the Skies in his Helicopter","<p>Set #6773 Alpha Team Helicopter: The second cheapest set, the Alpha Team Helicopter introduces us all to the leader of Alpha Team, Dash, and his vehicle of choice for the first year's mission against Ogel. Is of course a Helicopter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough this set was really quite fun, with it's black and transparent green pieces the Helicopter stands out when put next to the Helicopters more commonly found in LEGO City sets. There are a few stickers for the Alpha Team Logo details on the rear fins of the helicopter and the cockpit, which I think was a slightly darker tinted piece compared to other uses of the same piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dash as far as Mini-Figures go is a fun looking Mini-Figure. His face is printed with a more serious look to it compared to the friendlier citizens of LEGO Town/City, it also includes a mouthpiece for radio communications. This was my first exposure to this particular piece of hair as well, the straighter looking brown hair piece that was introduced by LEGO at this time. His torso printing is the Alpha Team uniform, which went down to his legs I think. Not sure if it was the type of plastic used or where his torso originated from, but he cracked on both sides of the torso, which was a real shame because it made his legs looser and prone to detaching when he was seated in the helicopter and you wanted to take him out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though this set is a great piece from LEGO Alpha Team, there were notably a few pieces that enjoyed falling off while playing with it, such as the landing gear and the tail, but if you were careful while handling it you could avoid this. Also, it looked a little bit better without the landing gear while in flight. So there was no real loss when the part did happen to fall off. I'd recommend it to any Alpha Team fans. Or anybody looking for some Helicopters for their LEGO City Airport that aren't Police or Fire oriented.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
