"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-06T15:42:32Z","good","This set is good for the tank treads and sub. This set also has Cam, the motors expert, and Flex, the ropes expert. The catapult is cool because you can easily launch a minifig 2 or 3 feet. I like the winch to raise and lower the sub. Therefore 10/10 is my rating. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"smiley905","2008-01-06T00:16:28.733Z","this is an great set.","i love this set, ther are three parts to it which are the sub, the trailer and the tank. the sub fits on the trailer which ataches to the back of the tank and they can go to another location. the sub is probably the best part, it has a cool front and i little prop on the back, a mf fits inside and it has lots of little details. the trailer is incredably basic, having nothing but a tiny base and some small wheels. though it could be a lot better, it still serves its perpose. the tank is also realy cool, it has neet tank tracks a cabin with controlls, and the front bumper folds down to reavel two hidden missles. it has a winch on the back to lower the sub into the water and a thing to launche the minifigure. this is a great set, and is realy worth the money!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-26T09:50:28.653Z","Very cool.","Very cool, indeed. The sub is totally awesome, and it looks like it could really go underwater. The tank is really neat too. You can lower the sub with the winch on the tank. The minifig Flex, is a nice addition and fits in the tank nicely. Same goes for Cam in the sub. I'm not sure if it is me, but the &quot;catapult&quot; doesn't work. I mean it isn't even hook up to a rubber band or spring or anything, so you have to like, punch the ladder to make Flex fly. That is the only reason I don't like it. 8 out of 10. But, despite that rating, I would still recommend it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ATV doesn't slip off a slope because of the rubber treads,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mini sub does not have any holes in it (unlike some other LEGO submarine sets),<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rare translucent pieces,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rare controls pieces (I counted three [Two on mini sub,one on ATV]),<br />
    Rare tread and zipline,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cable has at least three uses (lowering the sub,bungee jumping,and ziplining)<br />

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flex cannot hold the hook like he does in the picture,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flex's mouth takes up half his head (that's not really a con though),<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might not hurt to add some type of Ogel thing,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its kinda hard to try to get the ATV to roll on wood floors (it works great on <br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; carpet though)<br />

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-14T13:10:18.367Z","LEGO Alpha Team - Alpha Team ATV Review","All I can say is that I can't complain about this set. We get an atv vehicle, a small sub and a trailer where you can put on the sub. This trailer can be removed from the atv very easily. This set comes with two rare minifigs. We get agent Cam who is the female agent with the red hair and we get agent Flex who has a very awsome face with a big mouth. This Flex minifig is my favourite LEGO Alpha Team minifig from the 2001 sets.<br><br>The atv is very sturdy and the set is very easy to build. It has only one sticker which is for the atv. The cockpit of that vehicle opens very easily and you can see a cool dashboard in there. I also like the sviwel headlights in the front and the ladder which we get on the back. You can also take the ladder off and put it to the side. The little sub is also very cool. The cockpit opens and you can see a dashboard on each side. The headlights of the sub do sviwel and the propeller on the back does sviwel too. On the back of the atv is also a hook where you can drop this sub into the ground. If you look for some cool pieces and some cool minifigs I would recommend you to get this model.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-13T10:13:15.477Z","Alpha Team ATV can Tackle any Terrain","<p>Set #6774 Alpha Team ATV: The largest set from Alpha Team I ever owned at any one point, this vehicle combo is&nbsp;a very interesting looking model with some fun features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATV: The ATV consists of two pieces, the main vehicle and a small trailer for towing the mini-sub. The pieces are mostly black and yellow, and it rolls along on the treads, these treads have a tendency for popping off if one isn't careful... Well the treads don't pop off, but if you pushed too forcibly down when trying to get them to roll the white wheels centers would pop off. The ATV is a rough and rugged looking vehicle though that was simple and fun to build. It also featured a clip-on ladder that could be moved to get access to the sub and a winch with winching device that worked surprisingly well for holding the sub up when it was being lowered into the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sub: The Mini-Sub that Cam drives/pilots is a small secondary vehicle, it too uses mostly black and yellow pieces, the build however is quite unique for a sub. Or at least I hadn't seen that type of build before. The sphere like look of the model was achieved with some clever use of curved pieces and the bubble cockpit window, it was fun to play with and worked great alongside the Alpha Team Mission Deep Sea subs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both vehicles achieved their details/Alpha Team Logos with the use of stickers. Both Mini-Figures are unique looking, Flex has his trademark cap minus the visor or goggles or any other attachment piece and Cam comes with a unique colored straight red hair piece. She's also wearing glasses. Abouth the only thing off-putting about either Mini-Figure was the fact that Flex always had his mouth open. (He didn't include any double-sided head piece with perhaps a mouth closed print... The effect this gives is that he's constantly trying to catch flies while shouting gleeful greetings or something... I guess Flex just really loves his work.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd definitely recommend this set to other collectors. It is fun to build, fun to play with, includes two members of Alpha Team with rare Mini-Figure pieces. (Those Torsos and Heads were never seen again.) And the vehicles can do a lot, with the imagination, gimmic wise there isn't much here, but the winch system used to raise and lower the sub out of water (fake of course, you didn't want to get it wet.) works remarkably well. I had Cam hanging over the side of one of my display shelves for over a month at one point and not once did the sub accidentatlly fall off on it's own. (When someone accidentally brushed it with a coat or something, that was entirely different and almost rage inducing story.) If you're into Alpha Team, get this, if you're looking to get into Alpha Team, get this, if you're only familiar with Agents, get this too. It's that good, solid and fun.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
"WoutStopmotion","2012-08-13T07:14:02.11Z","Great set, Great price","Mah second review. Once, i found out about how the Alpha Team sets had these overdriven crazy yet classic faces and figs. Immediately i wanted to buy one. It became this one for Cam's hairpiece and Flex his face. Yet in the end Cam was missing and Flex had the wrong body...<br><br><b>Building Expirience<br><br></b>I bought the set secondhand and it was already quite assembled. I took it apart to build it up again and noticed some replaced pieces. Besides that it was a fun build. And it would be even more fun if everything wasn't so dusty, missing, and replaced. But that is just my fault, so its just an overall great build!<br><br><b>Parts<br><br></b>Well... what to say about this one? Great parts and stuff, nice figs, and nice accesoires such as a ladder which can also be used as a catapult, a zipline rope, and a submarine onto a trailer and so much more! I can't explain the awesomeness of this set.<br><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>Due to the cool pieces it also has lots of playability. The manual included a comic which shows the story behind this set, and it makes use of all the great features included in the set. You could use the roped hook to bring the submarine down, or use it as a zipline to get everywhere fast. You could use the ladder as a catapult to hook the zipline onto somewhere, and then just store it onto the side. The front bumper hides a set of lasers and there are a few lamps and lights and even rockets on the sides of the two vehicles.<br><br><b>Value for Money</b><br><br>The figures are awesome, the pieces are awesome, the playability is awesome... and its just 20 dollars? Holy s**t! Its great!<br><h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4><p><br></p><p>A great and really cheap set with lots of awesome features. Great for playing with and also for getting pieces and accescoires.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
