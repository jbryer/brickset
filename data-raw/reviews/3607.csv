But the rest of the set isn't so good. I wouldn't recommend this for the orignal price. The special code is FH97.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T21:39:02Z","Great explosive vehicles!!!","        This set is a good kicker if you like alpha team. I love the classic heads of Crunch the explosives expert and Charge the electrician. First, TeeVee's little orb rover is a little useless, but it adds more building, so thats o-kay! Crunch manns the ultimate cannon firer. It shoots those wickedly awesome bullet things with good power. It also has an engenious way of making the cannon aim up or down using gears. I also like that the cannon can be towed by the Alpha Team jeep. Manned by Charge, this powerful 4x4 beast has the huge wheels, alot of good packing space, and room for Charge to drive! I like orbs, they strike me as pretty cool little things, and this set includes one, so that gives it an automatic pro! I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes to ambush their little sister or pet dog! A go-ahead 10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-06T15:35:15Z","cool to the wow!","Great missiles, a 4*4 truck, and a evil orb. This set comes with Charge,the electrician of the team, and Crunch, the explosives expert. Cool target practice helps the aim. I would not recommend this for its original price of $35.00, but I'd definetly recommend it for $19.00. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"danim","2008-02-09T15:53:38.373Z","Good Set","This is a great set, the missiles are fantastic as is the jeep, tee vee is great as are the dynamite, the little vehicle is great for going into hostile enviroments, The minifigs are quite good as there is charge and crunch

I do not use the target any more as there is no point, I used it at first but then it got a bit boring.

If you can get this set, I advise getting it as it is brilliant",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-02-21T17:08:19.937Z","Missle mayhem!","This set is great and I got it about 5 years ago for christmas. I had the set before that but I lost the droid looking bomb orb and a few other pieces. I took the set and opened it anyway. It has lots of playibiliy and is a fun set to play with and combine with other sets. Nice set with two missles! It also has good sized vechiles and a blow up area and 3 minifigures including a robot! The price I saw is 19.99 but I didn't pay that price. However it is a good price! Let me list the pros and cons below.

pros: 
3 minifigures

price

orb

two vechiles

two missle firing system!

blow up area!

rare pieces

cons:

none


I would highy recommend it to any lego fan!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-25T20:24:52.67Z","Very cool.","Got this one for my 7th birthday or so. It is really neat how if you fire the truck missle', the orb pops out of a container. This set also includes TV along with Crunch and Charge. The supports on truck are also a neat feature. Twisty nob allows the missle' to move up or down. Car is also cool, but the bomb should go near Crunch not Charge. Overall 9.8 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T06:06:42.043Z","Charge and Crunch (and Teevee too), what a combo!","The two other men of the Alpha Team are found in this explosive set! The set has plenty of playability, doubling as both a mission or an FBI SWAT team, this set has all the explosive action it needs and then some. The cool loking SUV serves as transport for the explosives, while the larger vehicle is a mobile missile launcher (with two launchers good for any creative builder), the set also has the team's robot Teevee, and an RC transport drone for carrying hazardous objects like bombs or OGEL orbs (LEGO backwards), so the team doesn't have to get in harm's way (it must hate its job). The set also includes a (Training?) outpost with a target which launches an orb into the air.

A great set but the con to it is the rubber band for the claww is under constant stress so eventually, if unchecked, will snap; in fact, I left mine for so long, when I came back to it the band was still there, but wait, what's this, the band had solidified, stuck to the claws like glue, and when I moved it, the band litteraly disintegrated! Otherwise a great set. I think it also included a comic book in the instrucion  manual...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2008-09-30T18:47:32.59Z","DEMOLITION TIME!","I wasn't really into this stage of the Alpha Team series, I was better aquatinted with the Ice Orb series, but I can say that this is good for target practice! The mechanism that flings the orb out happens when you hit the target, and it works surprisingly well. The truck is fun, and includes a case with TNT and a plunger. While Chase drives the monster in the front, Crunch mans the towed along cannon. Unfortunately, which is what makes me rate this a 4, is that the walking TV and crane thing are pointless, as the crane can't even hold the orb, and that Alpha Team doesn't need a walking DVD player. (no offense)
Pros:
TWIN ROCKET LAUNCHERS!
Rare target piece
A death orb
Two mini-figures
Cool truck
Cons:
Pointless crane
Non-needed TV with legs
Strange and easy building.
