"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-27T00:00:00Z","","Needs more zombies, and more orbs. The baseplate was perfect for my new pirate base, because one, two structures can easily be built, with a passage in between them, and two, a little bay for a raft similiar to 6234. Also, two large dug out areas can make an even farther fall for for anyone falling through the trap door on the second story of my pirate base, or a hole in which two pirates are starting to dig up, either to bury treasure under the captains orders, or to bury his treasure without his orders. But enough about that (Well not really, I didn't even mention the bases two best features), and back to the set itself. It has lots of good trans orange and red pieces, Ogel's rocket drops orbs, and is modular(!!!), like the old space sets! The middle module, which carries and drops the orbs, can be removed and put some where, and the cockpit and the engines attach to make a smaller ship. The grey skull (on the tower) turns, releasing a trap door, which drops the orbs into the rail scooter's cargo carrying area, and the scooter scoots along the railings, 8 studs or so, to where it can drop the orbs into Ogel's rocket's storage area. When the front pillars of the second to top level of the tower are hit with the missile launcher 6775's missiles, they fall inward, letting the top story of the fall tower fall inward, and downward, on Technic pin hinges. There is a single computer in the building, on the ground floor. The escape scooter is flimsy, and boring. The secret code in the back of the book, after the ten page comic, is SR01. Lots of black 1x2x6 black pillars are included. I'm not sure if 50 USD was worth it, but I would definetly recommend 40 USD for this. I gave up on the land idea, and now Ogel has six scuba drones, instead of four, because I gave these guys Diver's scuba tanks, and Insectoid helemets, to make more marine drones. The siege on this base ended quickly, with every single one of my A.T. (land and air) vehicles (which is also EVERY single set in the first line) positioned around this base. I wanted Ogel to be captured, but I also wnated him to escape, so I let him and his two drones escape in his rocket, while a clone (of Ogel) from that small 6771 was captured.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T21:03:59Z","I finally got it!!","This set is great. Three evil orbs, two guards, and Ogel. The rocket is modular, with the middle section of the rocket being removed. The base has two pits, a shallow one and a slightly deeper one. A single computer is on the bottom floor. The second floor holds the escape scooter and a huge skull facade. The top floor houses Ogel's viewpoint. When the pillars on the tower are hit with 6775's missiles, the top floor falls in, plumting Ogel onto the ground below. The orb transport module is cool because it lets you drop orbs into Ogel's ship. The bay is a little small for Alpha Team's vehicles but Ogel's scooter fits right in. I'd recommend this set for 40 USD.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"PepperPizzaMan2585","2008-06-29T20:49:05.013Z","Great additon to Alpha Team!","This is a really cool set. I really like the big skull on the front and the rocket. Also, this set very playable. Especialy with the skeleton zombies and the orbs. But it could be a little better. I think that the control center should be bigger and it should come an alpha team person or vehicle so they could battle. So I rate this set a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-19T06:54:35.41Z","LEGO Alpha Team - Ogel Control Center Review","This is a very awsome base which I've built. It comes with a rocket, a helicopter and the base itself. This set also includes 3 minifigs. We get Ogel and two of his skeleton warriors which are exclusive to this set. We get a few stickers which you have to worry about. The bags are numbered and for some reason they also got separate boxes in the big box where you can find the numbered bags. The set is a great built and the vehicles and the base are very sturdy.<br>&nbsp;<br>The rocket is awsome. The windscreen opens and you can see the joysticks. For some reason there's no dashboard in there. The engines on the back look awsome too. The fins on the sides do sviwel and the containers on each side do open and you can see a skull in there. The middle has a cargo area where you can put the bombs and if you sviwel the lever on the bottom of the rocket you can drop the bombs. The helicopter is also very cool. The blades spin and we get a small engine on the back and two joysticks in the front.<br><br>Now the main attraction of this set: The base. The baseplate is the same baseplate which I've seen in the Sphynx Secret Surprise set from the LEGO Adventurers theme. The red window in the front can be taken out and you can see a computer. In the front you can see a cool translucent orange antenna. The platform for the rocket looks very neat. We also get a monorail which has a shovel in the front if you want to load the rocket. The skull which we can see in the first floor can be sviweled and the floor on the second floor does disappear. There's also a small balcony in the first floor which I use as a landing place for the small helicopter. The walls on the second floor can be folded in and the platform on the top is going to fold down and the window does smash on the ground. It's a cool base but I think there should have been some alpha team agents in this set who attack this base.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"clundsberg","2011-05-01T01:20:45.577Z","The Perfecet Secret Base!","<p>This has got to be one of my favourite Lego playsets.&nbsp; It currently is on display, looming against the skyline of the Lego city almost&nbsp;a twin to and certainly contrasting the towering Space Shuttle Launch set that is adjacent to it.</p>
<p>I'll begin with my only anti-Ogel statement: GET SOME MORE HELP, EH?&nbsp; I mean seriously, how can you take on the Alpha Team when all you have are 2 other minions, and these guys are busy doing manual labour at the control center to boot!&nbsp; Lego should have perhaps added a couple more guys to the set or at least offered an army builder set of&nbsp;innocents to minions.&nbsp; Fortunately now I have a Mad...er...Crazy Scientist mini to help out, and&nbsp;sure -&nbsp;maybe some older&nbsp;Blacktron guys too.</p>
<p>And now for the good: This set has a lot of features!</p>
<p>-The base is the same mold as used for the Adventurers Sphinx set. (and perhaps others that I do not own) This is a fun base and very adaptable for different play.</p>
<p>-The Ogel striker set fits well into the river entrance!</p>
<p>-Can't escape by river, you say? There's always the&nbsp;getaway mini-coptor on the roof! BWA-HAHAHA!</p>
<p>-Command Center at the top will plummet to the ground if the support beams/speakers are shot out!&nbsp; The top looks to be some kind of amplification module for bellowing out commands to his brain-washed minions.</p>
<p>-The middle level of the tower has a trap-door activated by rubber band mechanism by rotating the giant skull.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is used to dump the skull-bombs into the loader.</p>
<p>-The loader pivots on a notched 360 degree base and can tip forward to not only retrieve the bombs from the middle level of the tower, but to easily drop off the bombs into the awaiting cargo hold of Ogel's flying bomber.&nbsp; The loader smoothly slides along a short railway to go from the tower to the aircraft.</p>
<p>-The bottom section of the tower holds a control room with reddened transparent window.&nbsp; This control room can detatch to reveal a secret underground compartment.</p>
<p>-The ship is sleek in design and held upright on the launchpad by two swinging arms.&nbsp; The aricraft is assembled in 3 interchangeable sections: Engine with 2 additional compartments for holding bombs, Cargo-hold complete with opening door for loading and/or bombing as well as gull-winged windows for additional access, and Cockpit which could double as an escape vehicle in case something goes awry.</p>
<p>Fun set to build and looks great as a menacing backdrop.&nbsp; If you get the chance, pick it up!&nbsp; You won't be disappointed with this one.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-27T10:22:46.9Z","A quintessential evil base - Ogel's evil base is devilshly good!","<p>As a kid, I poured over the Lego catalogues and looked, lovingly, at the sets I would never end up owning.&nbsp; I&#39;ve mentioned this quite a few times at the start of reviews, and it makes it sound like I was seriously deprived but it was more that I was entranced by the ideas and possibilities of these sets.&nbsp; The pieces, the minifigures, it made my small collection of Town Jr sets and the small &quot;stocking stuffer&quot; sets look like chump change.&nbsp; I&#39;d look at the big sets in the catalogue, the Aquazone&#39;s Neptune Discovery Lab, the Divers Deep Sea Bounty, the Adventurer&#39;s sets, and they all had one thing in common which I came to associate with &quot;big sets&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot;.</p>

<p>Baseplates.</p>

<p>I lusted over the tan desert baseplates, the raised Castle ones used for Knight&#39;s Kingdom and Ninja, the textured Paradisa ones.&nbsp; To me, they represented that this set was &quot;big&quot;.&nbsp; This set was &quot;important&quot;.&nbsp; That a set was truly, sub-zero COOL.</p>

<p>Now by 2001, I was tapped out of Lego proper and fully immersed in Bionicle. My only contact with Alpha Team was seeing the ad for a video game in a software CD.&nbsp; I think I only saw a glimpse of this set once and I see Alpha Team pop up from time to time in Lego Youtubers stuff - most recently, a reference to this set was made in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10273-1/Haunted-House"">10273 Haunted House.</a>&nbsp; But I always liked Alpha Team&#39;s original aesthetic - reminded me of GI Joe crossed with Mission Impossible.</p>

<p>I got the Ogel Control Centre on Facebook Marketplace for about $70 dollars not really knowing much about it, and when it turned up, all black, dark red and grey, I realised I&#39;d bought my first proper baseplate set.&nbsp; I&#39;d made it to the big leagues. Made it ma, top of the world.&nbsp; But little did I know that with the baseplate came a devishly good set...</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The build starts with the rocket, which is modular in design and can split into three distinct sections ala old space designs like Futuron or Blacktron.&nbsp; The cockpit, mid-section and the tail are all able to detach from each other using technic pins and the entire thing is brick built - there&#39;s no big bulky piece making up the bulk of the hull and it was refreshing to build something like this with actual bricks.&nbsp; There are still some larger pieces used like the black slope at the top of the rocket and some big wing pieces, but overall it has a great shape and very evil trans-dark red and black colour scheme. The tri-booster design at the bottom with the three fins is especially cool, giving this a missile like appearance and the modularity of it makes it great for play.&nbsp; There&#39;s a large central compartment with opening gullwing doors, trapdoors and two storage containers in the rear rocket booster section.</p>

<p>The rest of the build is centered on the baseplate and building Ogel&#39;s Control Centre.&nbsp; It&#39;s the same baseplate that appeared in Paradisa&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6416-1/Poolside-Paradise"">Poolside Paradise </a>and the Adventurer&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5978-1/Sphinx-Secret-Surprise"">Sphinx Secret Surprise</a>, just with a different texture and colour.&nbsp; Here, the baseplate is a dark grey with muted blue water, black paths and some grey texturing in the pit areas.</p>

<p>You work from the bottom to top, moving over to construct Ogel&#39;s rocket platform and the little cargo monorail which loads the Ogel Orbs from the tower to the rocket.&nbsp; Then you build the entire top three stories of the tower with the skull and all as a separate build which is then attached to some jumper plates on the ground floor in the final steps.&nbsp; The tower breaks off into sub-builds when needed, and it never feels repetitive or boring as you&#39;re always going up and up.</p>

<p>When finished, I put this up on a bookcase and wow, this absolutely looks great.&nbsp; The colours, the imposing height of the tower and the looming rocket sitting at the launch pad really make this look like an evil base worthy of a super villain.&nbsp; It felt satisfying to see it sitting there, and it made me circle around, take some pictures and really take it in. The baseplate really works to give it height and texture, and the different levels and the colour scheme make it really pop.</p>

<p>This was a great build that took, all up, maybe an hour at most.&nbsp; It felt good, and moved along well, and there were only a couple of times when I wondered if I was &quot;doing it right&quot;. All in all, well done!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Oh boy, does this set has some NICE parts.&nbsp; There&#39;s about 400 parts to this set and a lot of them are useful for your own creations.&nbsp; I&#39;ll highlight some pieces below</p>

<p>First off, there&#39;s a very rare and desirable piece in this set - Black Cylinder Quarter 4x4x6.&nbsp; Now this piece has appeared in loads of different colours in lots of different sets but it only appeared in two sets in black:&nbsp; it appeared in the Darth Maul UCS bust from 2001 and it appeared here.&nbsp; As such, this piece is about $45 dollars at its cheapest on Bricklink, which is almost half the cost of this set!</p>

<p>Then, you&#39;ve got the baseplate.&nbsp; That&#39;s a really piece to have, 32x32, and is able to be used for all sorts of play scenarios.&nbsp; The inclusion of a little river bit, some dark pits, this could easily be used to make an urban mansion, a police station, an office building, whatever.</p>

<p>Then we had a lot of pieces appearing here only in red such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the Red Panel 3 x 6 x 6 Sloped with Window that&#39;s used on the ground floor to provide some &quot;bulk&quot;.&nbsp; It&#39;s a piece that was only used three times by Lego, and only appeared once in red here;</li>
	<li>the Windscreen 6 x 6 Octagonal Canopy, which you get two of at the top of the set.&nbsp; The full red versions are exclusive to this set, and were never found anywhere else;</li>
	<li>the Trans-Red Cylinder Half 2 x 4 x 4 (also at the top of the set near the Octagonal Windscreens) and that, you guessed it, also only appeared in this set; and</li>
	<li>the Windscreen 7 x 4 x 1 2/3 in trans-red used as the canopy for Ogel&#39;s rocket only appeared in this set.</li>
</ul>

<p>And those are just the pieces that come to mind as set exclusives.&nbsp; There&#39;s lots of tall pillars, small bricks, ridged bricks, turntables, pylons, bars, plates which make this is a great set to use for parts in your own creations.&nbsp; Pieces like this always go to great use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get three minifigures - Ogel and two of his Skeleton Minions in their distinctive red/black attire, both carrying spears.&nbsp; The printing on the figures is crisp, nice.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Another reason this set shines is due to the play features, of which there are quite a few on offer.</p>

<p>On the tower you&#39;ve got the Control Centre on the top, which can be knocked down if the tall black support beams with the logos are pushed over.&nbsp; Doing so topples the top of the tower, letting the pod at the top come crashing down to the ground below.</p>

<p>Below that, turning the skull on the front of the base opens a trapdoor which can drop Ogel Orbs from the floor above to the floor below, ready for the loader on the railway to pick up.&nbsp; This whole mechanism works with an elastic band, but I opted to leave the elastic band off as it was so old it looked like it might snap.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s a small monorail with a loader/dozer sort of thing that works on a ratcheted turntable.&nbsp; It can turn 360 degrees and tilt forwards to dump things out of the hopper or receive orbs from the skull turning action.&nbsp; You can then drive the hopper down the monorail over to the rocket.</p>

<p>The rocket has a trap door on the bottom held shut by a small brick on a hinge.&nbsp; When the rocket stands vertical, you can drop the trap door so that the loader on the monorail can drop off the Ogel Orbs into the hold of the rocket.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great little system and works very well for the size.&nbsp; Then the rocket stand has two large arms which hold the rocket in place.&nbsp; You can push back the arms to simulate a launch.&nbsp; Once the rocket is in the air, you can let the trapdoor open and drop Ogel Orbs on the unwitting civilians below.&nbsp; You&#39;ve got lots of storage room inside the rocket for dropping minions into battle, and two smaller storage compartments in the rear for extra bombs or weapons.</p>

<p>The Ogel Command Striker, <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/56561"">which I&#39;ve also reviewed</a>, slots into the river perfectly and makes a great little attack craft or getaway vehicle for Ogel or one of his minions.&nbsp; If you need to make an aerial approach, you&#39;ve got simple little mini helicopter on the roof which Ogel could use to flee the scene or a minion could use to track the Alpha Team from the sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Smaller extras include a large control bay on the ground floor which can be opened to show&nbsp; a hidden compartment under the base and of course you can put Ogel up the top on his big brainwashing device, sending evil commands to his skeleton minions.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to a GREAT playability score.&nbsp; There&#39;s so much to do here for a kid, and I can only imagine the kind of stories that might have come out of this.&nbsp; Ogel&#39;s minions loading up the rocket ready to bomb a city, and the Alpha Team have to storm the island and save the day.&nbsp; Or maybe Ogel is issuing commands to the world from here, and the rocket is a getaway craft?&nbsp; Or perhaps Ogel escapes to the moon in his rocket from here, like a James Bond villain?&nbsp; Or maybe it&#39;s none of that, maybe he&#39;s the good guy?</p>

<p>A couple of things that I believe would have helped the playability is the inclusion of maybe two more skeleton minions and maybe an Alpha Team member.&nbsp; I mean, Ogel just gets two skeleton minions, and they&#39;re delegated to driving the monorail dropping off Ogel orbs, or keeping lookout.&nbsp; And this is the only set you could get them in, so how are you meant to amass an evil army?&nbsp; Two more would have helped with the evil army part.&nbsp; Secondly, I think the inclusion of an Alpha Team member could have created a great bit of &quot;conflict in a box&quot; where it just opens up another story possibility.&nbsp; Maybe the Alpha Team member has been kidnapped?&nbsp; Or maybe they&#39;re a traitor?&nbsp; If not an Alpha Team member, maybe some civilians could have been included to raise the stakes but then again, I suppose you could just include your own minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>This set is easily worth the $70 dollars I paid for it on Facebook Marketplace.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth over $100, but the cost of buying this set piece by piece would probably exceed that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So really, I think this set is worth $60 to $115 dollars or so, give or take the market and shipping costs.&nbsp; And honestly, I&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely worth the price of admission.&nbsp; Lego has built a fair few &#39;evil bases&#39; but this one just really takes the cake for me. It&#39;s a perfect mix of retro, style, design and bricks and special pieces.</p>

<p>Now, in terms of shopping around, take your time and see what comes up.&nbsp; You need to make sure the stickers are there and the baseplate is in good condition.&nbsp; Regarding the stickers, my set was missing all but two of the stickers but on a set like this, it looks phenomenal even with some missing stickers so don&#39;t stress too much about this.&nbsp; But the one thing I can&#39;t stress is that you ensure the baseplate is in good condition - sun-faded or cracked just won&#39;t look that good for a set like this.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I think a lot of the Alpha Team sets from the first 2001 wave are a little dinky with weird colours, mostly just vehicles with few play features.&nbsp; The Alpha Team didn&#39;t have a base of their own, just a motley assortment of vehicles while Ogel, evil genius he undoubtedly is, has a giant tower on an island surrounded by storm.&nbsp; That should give you an idea how cool he is, who else builds a giant skull on a building - that just let&#39;s everyone know what he&#39;s about. Ogel reminds me of a GI Joe villain like Cobra Commander with this base, all skulls and dark red and black.</p>

<p>This is the second &quot;big set&quot; I own with a baseplate, and I&#39;ve got two Divers sets here to build as well. The building process absolutely trumped my childhood collection of Town Jr sets, polybags, Shell promotionals and stocking stuffers.&nbsp; It felt engaging, varied and didn&#39;t drag itself out over hours and hours.</p>

<p>This is an absolutely brilliant set, with lots of great play features and parts and an enjoyable, displayable finished product.&nbsp; It could easily find a place on your shelf or in your City layout as an evil base.</p>

<p>If it pops up online for a price you consider by your own standard to be &quot;worth it&quot;, or around the price point I mentioned above, I&#39;d say to get it!&nbsp; Let Ogel take over your life!</p>
