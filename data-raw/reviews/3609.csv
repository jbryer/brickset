The light and sound really gave it the finishing touch.  This would be ranked as my number 1 in terms of looks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-16T23:40:45.583Z","Light-and sound spacecraft","This was one of the first space sets to come with battety-operated lights and sounds, and it's a nice-looking craft covered in useful pieces.  Unfortunately I have two major gripes.  A: The back section, when detached, serves no apparent function.  B: Those bendy wires are just a pain in the neck.  You have to try to twist them into some ridiculous positions on this set, and they simply refuse to stay put.  But that said, this ship is still well worth tracking down.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"frechling","2008-03-03T12:49:19.687Z","Purchased in Legoland / Billund - love it!","I definitely love this set. When visiting Legoland in Billund/Denmark as a child, I chose this set as a souvenir from the very impressive shop. It was one of the most expensive sets, and my dad was not very happy about that. *lol*

Some weeks ago, I rebuilt this remarkable spaceship and immediately the fascination returned.

PRO:
- light &amp; sound system, which made me always play in the dark - loved the atmosphere... sounds are a bit boring
- nice color combination. black &amp; white with some color spots
- the back of the ship looks great, love those 6 brackets
- strangly constructed but nice fighter can be separated from the rest
- good firepower

CON:
- should be a black or white astronaut, the yellow one does not fit to the color scheme
- red lasers on the sides fall off easily",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>Long time ago, but still it is one piece of heartwarming quality. And as it the first time bleeped and made this light flashes, wow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set itself is now from an extinct species in the Lego-Universe, only to be made fun of in some movie, what is sad in my opinion. I think every little kid dreams of being up there among the stars at one point on his/her journey&nbsp;to grow up. Lego should have still some set to cater this, what do you think?</p>

<p>Well back to the set. It is failry&nbsp;easy to build, but now with hard to get parts, like the electircity&nbsp;conducting bricks, the light brick, that blinked and the sound brick. Unfortunatly&nbsp;my set did not age well, because stupid me did not took out the 9V-Batteryblock&nbsp;20 years ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of the parts still look good, but the functions are a mere shadow of what they have been. I played hours with the set, and the other space-sets as well. The set could be splited into an front piece and the big engine part, it remindes me now a tiny little bit on Episode 2 from Star Wars, where the Jedi had this power-ring to enable small vessels a hyper-speed flight. Or like the STNG&nbsp;Enterprise D, that could split of the dish-section from the rest of the ship.</p>

<p>You can see, it is an emotional set for me. It had/has a big play-value, some of the parts itself are now hard to get so it has now a nice value. I do not think, that you will get a complete working set now easy, and even on bricklist the special parts are all only just used and seldom in mint condition.</p>

<p>Building is rather complicated, and as the model is and stays fragile, can be quite a pain for a model that size. But one never stops to wonder when the &quot;attach one more funky thing&quot; actually stops &ndash; and it does not for quite a while.</p>

<p>Parts are a trans-colour galore ... there are dishes, there are antennas, there are cones, there as light and sound modules, there are tubes, there are 10(!) of those landing thingies at the base, there are 6(!) control nozzles, there are 6(!) supports and lots of rocket stuff. One minifig is not much though for that size of a ship, but there is no place to put more.</p>

<p>Playability is a mixed bag ... it has sound, and light, and light, and it can split apart. But it is fragile as hell.</p>

<p>Getting the parts for this is rather expensive today, so value for money is not great, but if you are trying to get it out of nostalgia or completeness, it&#39;s still okay.</p>
