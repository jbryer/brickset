I needed more cars and citizens for my city so they came very handy since i guess i paid like US$ 5.00 for the both sets.  I am very grateful i bought this set because it had a lot of playability, for example it was a gas station for a long time at my town.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The racing car isn't very aerodynamic, but there's only so much you can do with the part selection available then.  I get an early BMW vibe from it which isn't a bad thing at all.

The garage is pretty basic, just a roof and wall, but it does the job well enough.  Nice design for how few parts they used.

All in all it has very good playability; to my kids it's a general mechanic for their various Lego (and non-Lego) cars, airplanes, boats, you name it.

Also I still wonder how the promo picture made it into production with the mechanic's legs on backwards. (look at it!)  That's gotta hurt, though he doesn't seem to mind.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
