First off, as always, Space Police I ships are missing engines. That gives the ship a lopsided feel as it is heavily armed (six lasers) in the front. There is the usual jail cell complete with a Blacktron I figure.n This can be removed, and once two hinges are pushed down near the battery pack, the entire battery pack, attached computer, and upper wing assembly can be removed. 

The extended canopy is reminiscent of Blacktron I's Battrax. Inside are two computers, one being a  light-up, which is coupled with the six lights in the upper wings. These can be set to blink on and off or remain constant. The four wings give a good fighter look, and the lower two can be folded down while in flight. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mcicero7","2008-11-12T14:02:24.937Z","Highly underated","This set never seemed to gain the attention it deserved.

Not only does it have the only light-up computer piece Lego ever put out, but the solid construction makes for high playability. Overall design is fairly simple with plenty of options for modifications. Engines can be added to the based or under the front laser assemblies, the adjustable wings also could do with some engines.  Lasers can be enhanced with more modern pieces but as it stands it fits in very nicely with the other first generation Space Police sets. More than anything else though it serves as a great step up from the Galactic Peace Keeper (6886). 

If you can find one, which isn't easy anymore, it is definitely worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The design of this set is fanstastic and is a must own for Space Police fans. This is the best Space Police set by far, and can't be compared.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-29T07:52:43.763Z","great starfighter!","It resembles the peacekeeper a bit, but this one is larger. Again, it includes one of the special, switchable jail cells. Well i don't care for light up effects, these can be pretty cool, although similiar are used later in blacktron II, which doesn't make much sense. The cockpit of this ship is brilliantly designed and well thought up.

Despite not being the largest ship Space Police, it is very unusual because it has lights. And of course work. The lights module fits within the skeleton of the ship.<br><br>Ligths have 2 position: Intermitent &amp; permanent<br><br>Great because also its modularity is very curious, because the modules are not to put together but to fit within one in another, the small into the big one.

"middlerealm","2010-02-05T11:45:20.343Z","The Best of the Space Police!","I had this set when I was a kid and it was the pride of my entire collection!

There is very little wrong with this kit; movable wings, detachable jail cell, lots of guns, 2 cool minifigs (Blacktron 1 figs were so much cooler than their neon follow-ons). It simply looks amazing, and for those complaining that the lights are 'too much', trust me, when you have the ship built up and in your hands, flick on the switch and bear witness to its awsomeness! The lights are the cherry on top of an incredible looking set. It also lent itself very well to rebuilding into other models, something that the smaller sets were not too hot at. With this set, the possibilities are endless!

I am currently trying to find one of these since, as many of us did, I gave away all of my lego when i hit my late teens. Now I'm wishing I didn't as this set is incredibly hard to find now.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
