"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-26T01:37:18Z","But how do you hear the sounds in space?","Hey, the light and sound thing was pretty cool when I played with this spacecraft as a child, although you have to wonder how you were supposed to hear the sound in space. You can have the lights on steady or make them flicker, and you can control the sound as well by turning a special cylindrical brick. Because you need a battery box, the model is pretty bulky, although it hides it well. I didn't find the design of the spacecraft satisfactory, although it was cool having the different parts all be detachable. I did find it funny that the little rover was tacked on at the end like an afterthought.

There are great parts in this set, including no less than five of those big sloped covers. But the column parts are a bit tricky to incorporate into your own spacecraft creations.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zek","2007-11-19T02:28:14.903Z","A space classic","    I would have to say this is one of the most coolest classic space sets. The set consists of light and sound which is cool and dont see used in sets anymore i guess its more appealing to younger lego fans. The battery box hides well.

    The ship seperates in a few pieces and parts of the ship can be used like a base. the little rover is a little neat addition to the set, very simple design and easy builing, and lots of good and hard to find peices like hoses, slopes which could be used in your own space designs.

"StormSworder","2009-03-21T02:30:36.983Z","A fantastic set.","One of the best Classic Space designs, this spacecraft looks great.  Not only that, but it has several detachable segments such as a moon buggy and ground bases.  There is a wealth of useful pieces and unlike certain other early light-and-sound space sets, this is a set which could easily have worked without the light-and-sound unit, therefore making the light-and-sound unit a bonus.  The colour schene s also great, and there are plenty of details including computers, tools and a little robot.

However, I do like the ATV and the interior of the ship. Overall, this isn't bad but needs work.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"robban75","2018-09-20T08:12:48.463Z","One of the last! One of the best!","<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Translation"" dir=""ltr"" id=""tw-target-text"">When this set came out in 1986, my dark age had already been somewhat activated. And, sadly, I never hade this particular set in my possession as a child. I wasn&#39;t completely uninterested in LEGO, but it wasn&#39;t my main focus anymore. Much to blame for this was the movie Top Gun which really caught my attention and steered my interests elsewhere. However,&nbsp;I still have fond memories visiting toy stores and seeing new LEGO-sets on the shelves.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Back in the day, 6783 especially caught my eye. Not only because LEGO had implemented light and sound, but also because it had a strong resemblance to the visitor shuttle from the TV-series V, which I liked a lot.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">As a child, having played with sets like 918, 928, 897 and&nbsp;6929. The colour scheme of 6783 really made&nbsp;it stand out among&nbsp;the others. The overall white scheme with inserts of black, coupled with a variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;trans-coloured pieces, as well as one red and one yellow mini-figure helped create&nbsp;a balance that was pleasing to my eye.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I&#39;m and adult now(debatable). And in my quest to have a complete classic LEGO space collection I finally managed to acquire&nbsp;a boxed(but opened) 6783 set with instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The box is quite big, and it has that lovely lid on the top which can be opened in order to view the plethora of pieces inside. Some of which I hadn&#39;t owned previously. The black radar dish, the black windscreen/slope,&nbsp;as well as the white slope with the printed moon comes to mind. The box also shows several interesting alternate builds. One which make especially good use of the corner wall pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The build was easy.&nbsp;But due to the large amount of pieces, it took a surprisingly long time to finish. I also invited my 9 year old son to assist me in building it, which might have had an impact on build time. ;-) I try as much as possible to involve my kids in building these classic sets. A double reward, kind of. Watching them being&nbsp;excited over a LEGO-set that was released more than 30 years ago really puts a smile on my face!</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The finished build is pleasing to behold. It is quite large,&nbsp;the weight is good, and the design looks really cool! It is definitely swooshable, even for a child. It requires some care when &quot;taking off&quot;, but once spaceborn, and when placed firmly in the hand(or hands) swooshing automatically begins! :-D</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The ship can be split into 3 large sections. The front part becomes a smaller spaceship, which looks really nice all by&nbsp;itself. The remaining&nbsp;modules can be divided from each other. They are quite similar, but they differ enough to make each one unique. The engine section can be removed and is attachable&nbsp;to either module. The little rover is rather awkwardly placed in the aft section, but adds play value. It looks pretty good and has just enough details to make it&nbsp;interesting. The tiny blue robot probably doesn&#39;t add too much to the overall set, other than perhaps colour&nbsp;balance. My kids disagree&nbsp;with me here. They love all the little robots in these classic sets!</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">What about the lights and sound? This is the first time I&#39;ve owned a LEGO-set with these functions. And although it is over 30 years old both light&nbsp;and sound&nbsp;works perfectly! The ship&nbsp;really comes alive! Especially when the lights are activated. In a dimly lit room the effect is fantastic! There are two kinds of sounds. And I must say that these&nbsp;sounds are pretty bad. I can do well without them! Again, my kids disagree&nbsp;with me here! :-D</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">As a classic space completist, this ship is a must have! For a non completist? I say get it if you can! It offers plenty of play value! And it looks cool! The modular design offers variety. The special parts can help create really awesome alternate builds. Although this set came in the twilight years of classic space, the design delivers all the goodness of earlier large sets! And when adding lights and sound to the equation, it can rival the best in the series!</p>
