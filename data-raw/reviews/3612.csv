"Blade","2007-08-29T11:32:23.583Z","A Hard One","Getting down to the bottom of the box now as i have pulled out all the big models and they are waiting to be rebuilt. I am happy to get to review this model first, but i can see why i am. This one really is a no brainer. As the wagon has 12 pieces, the mini fig is 5 and the 3 extras, totalling 20 pieces, you will understand.

Still the wagon is good, it's practical, adds alot of playability to a set, but has none on its own. Looks neat, Keep out sign is rare and is printed. Has 3 guns which makes it good for weapons collectors. Can't find a flaw and being only 20 pieces im glad about that.

Overall a nice addition to your western set or looks good on display. A good 5/10 here and is worth a look. Don't just discard due to size or simplicity.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-10T18:49:31.747Z","Bad guys need weapons too.","Inexpensive set with unique parts. The Keep out piece is painted not a sticker. The mini barrel is useful, plenty of guns &amp; rifles for your western frontier. Another mini figure for the theme, around $2.00 retail ( I ordered two ). Love the Western theme would love to see it make a come back onto the shelfs again soon.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-20T11:15:11.263Z","Bang, bang!","Another superb set and the most affordable one of the Western series!

Pros:
Very manly looking bandit.
2 rifles.
1 pistol. (Not easy to find)
Keep Out sign is printed and not stickers.
Has a dynamite.

Cons:
Very little pieces.. but that doesn't let me rate is a 4 instead of a 5!

I think that those who have very little money but still want cool minifigs and pieces should get this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

 Westerners was one of the first series to use polybags to distribute small sets. As today, they were often exclusives distributed to various specific vendors and they usually included a single minifigure and some props. In 1997, that system had yet to be fully worked out. The only Westerners polybag set was called Bandit&#39;s Wheelgun, and was boxed separately as Bandit with Gun (6790). Both were fairly common and, unlike other bagged sets, were available at multiple vendors.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Innovations: The wheelgun was anything but innovational. It was a simple wheeled cart with two rifles mounted on top and a &quot;Keep Out&quot; sign in front. Similar devices had been used in the Castle theme for many years as small boxed sets and in rare polybag sets.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Lack of Inspiration: The lack of inspiration is obvious just from the canvasing of the set. Everything about this set suggests it was hastily and crudely built. The bandit is holding a gun while pushing the cart which has two guns on it. He has a barrel with TNT knocked over and steaming, and his strangely white bandana is askew. Everything about this set looks quick and easy, which begs the question: why did they make this specific set?</p>
<p>
 <br />
 What It Got Right: Despite its hastiness, the set did get a few things right. This specific bandit was fairly hard to find in 1996 in cheap sets, but here he is in 1997 in a $2.00 set. That is nice in itself, though for $2 more, you could get the Sheriff and a horse as well (Sheriff&#39;s Showdown [6712]). The &quot;Keep Out&quot; sign was very rare to the series, only appearing in Bandit&#39;s Secret Hide-Out (6761), and the excess of guns is always nice for people that like to add non-themed figures into the series, or just do a custom shoot-out scene with lots of guns. Also, having a wheel gun in itself is not crazy, so supplying one so cheaply is actually rather nice.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Possible Improvements: The marketing of this set is what really needs correcting. The bandana should be black or some other color, not white. The bandit shouldn&#39;t have, or at least be holding, a pistol when he&#39;s trying to wheel a heavy gun cart. And the purpose of the barrel with TNT was what, exactly? It seems superflous to the extreme. Replace the TNT and barrel with a sagegrass piece, put the pistol somewhere else, replace the bandana, and we have a nice, well thought-out set here.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigure: I&#39;ve already critiqued the bandana, but otherwise, the minifigure is pretty nice. He is known as Bandit #4 and he is unique to this set (because of the bandana). In reality, he is Bandit #1, the leader of the group. His shift is a black jacket covering a blue button-up short with a holstered pistol. This version wears dark gray pants, a brown cowboy hat, and black gloves. His face is an angry snarl with tilted eyes, a rough face, large moustache, and lots of head hair. Overall, a well designed, though monochrome, headpiece.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 How it Compares: Today, Bandit #4 can best be compared to the Collectible Minifigures Series 6 Bandit figure, that has a 1920s-style black hat, crimson bandana, and gunbelts everywhere. Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t bet on Bandit #4 versus CMF6 Bandit in a firefight. Too much has changed, from eye and scruff details, to leg printing and back printing, to even the colors available. Bandit #4 is just very stereotypical. The rest of the set is fine for what it is, especially if some of my recommended improvements were made. But overall, this is just an okay set for its price. You get a bandit and some guns, but do you really get much of a set you can play with? Perhaps.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 QUALITY SCORE: 6/10</p>
