"Novelty","2008-02-16T00:11:59.107Z","Here's looking at you, kid","Small sets are usually badly done due to the lack of pieces, but this one is an exception.  Mounting guns to a set of wheels is a good idea, but this set doesn't just do it in a barebones sort of way.  Instead of one gun, there's two mounted on the top and it adds the &quot;Keep Out&quot; label in front to make it look a whole lot better.  The pistol and barrel and dynamite that's included with this set improves play.  A small little set that's good for parts and building armies, but is good on its own or together with the larger sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-24T15:19:45.36Z","Good small western set","This is a small set from western, but looks like with some themes from these ages, like the castle's theme and too pirates. It like with castle because have the same wheels of many carts, but in this are black, and in castle, more brown. And with pirates because it have too guns. Have too little pieces to make a lego scenery, like the dynamite and the barrel. Like the western small or great sets, it have a piece with sticker, like the included on the front of the vehicle saying &quot;keep out&quot; The minifigure is a bandit too included in the sheriff's lock-up set, and have too a hat, included many with bandits and with the sheriff.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-06-09T15:51:44.42Z","4 weapons in one small set!","They are pistol(x1), rifle(x2) and dynamite(x1). This looks good with any of the cowboy sets.
