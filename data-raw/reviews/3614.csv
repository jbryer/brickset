Not many, plus you get a horse a wagon and the bad guys gun trailer can be pulled by the wagon. This set can keep my kids entertained for hours.

"Blade","2008-02-25T01:17:15.733Z","Old Fashion Wagon Robbery","Found the models for this ages ago but only found the playscape recently so it's time to review now that everything is together. Got this for about $12 back in the day from World 4 Kids. I mainly wanted it for the playscape and because it was different. You get two sets with it so I will break them down.

Firstly the good guys. The carriage is very strong and sturdy which is nice and realistic. The front wheels and shaft turn with the direction of the horse. The lock box is quite neat containing 2x$100 bills. For added security there is a chain running from either side of the driver to ensure no one opens it or it doesn't fall off as it isn't clipped down. To make the chain tight around the lock box simply rotate where chain clip onto the carriage around towards the driver and the chain will tighten up. There is also two free clips at the back for weapons and a peg to hitch the bandits trailer on.

The driver of the carriage is the sheriff dressed in black pants and his grey jacket. He is also wearing the grey wide brimmed hat, with the star and has a moustache and has stubble on his face. He is carrying a black whip and a pistol. His pal is dressed in blue pants, red shirt, brown vest and a white wide brimmed hat. His face is the standard smile with a long white fringe. He is armed with a shotgun. 

Secondly the bad guys. They are armed with a small trailer with duel shotguns mounted on it to attack the carriage. It is a whole 11 pieces and wouldn't be any good if it wasn't part of this set. 

There are two bandits, one dressed in all black and is armed with a pistol and dynamite, the other dressed in grey pants, red shirt and armed with duel pistols. Both have black handkerchiefs over their faces and brown wide brimmed hats on.

The playscape is a cardboard box with holes cut in it and platforms for both groups to stand on. There are also two flaps with rocks on them that lift up to help give a bit more of a three dimensional theme.

Overall a nice little set that has excellent playability and brilliant aesthetics. Back in the day it was rare to get a set so dirt cheap with four mini figs, a horse, a vehicle and a tone of weapons. Overall I feel this set is an 8/10 or Excellent. I don't think you will ever get more bang from your buck out of another set. I real should have and a must for any western or cowboy fan.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-01T19:49:50.5Z","Great set","This western set is made with two separated sets, one with the sheriff and other with bandits. The two have two differents minifigures, don't to build an army of minifigures, but to make a lego battle scene. The sheriff have a brown horse, very cool, connected to a cart with four wheels, and a safe with printed money pieces. This is very playable, the four wheels are good to play with, these keeps the cart feet. The sheriff have a whip, a printed moustache and a hat, like the another minifigure, with printed white hair. The bandits have a cart with two wheels, this keep in feet because the minifigure can carry it, with upgrades or with alternate models with the pieces. To make creations with it is very easy. Only in this set, are included six wheels, four minifigures and weapons like shotguns, and printed pieces like money or dynamites. This is a useful set, in overall, these western carts are great and compatible with castle, and another themes. The minifigures too, to make armies or patrols. I rate this double set 5/5.
