"Blade","2007-09-05T12:32:44.693Z","I Saw a UFO, But Nobody Believed Me","Just finished rebuilding this one so figure ill do the review at the same time. The name of this model amuses me, as I thought &quot;Cyber Blaster&quot; would have been for a more dangerous looking model but it still works.

Well this model is a small scout ship. It uses a satellite dish as a hover disk, Has a long gun either side of the ship and possibly the best part of all, the front piece is painted on. The control panel is on a hinge for play convenience and its quite detailed too. Again Painted, not stickered.

The mini-fig is a blue alien with grey/ black uniform and lots of detail on it. He is also holding a &quot;Blaster&quot; which really could have used a fluoro piece of some sort but most models this size dont seem to get hand weapons in space so i guess we are just lucky this time.

Overall another nice space model and worth of your space collection. I feel this one is a 5/10, Average, but what do you expect from a $3 AU model. Fits in nicely with any space series or just into any general play.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This minifigure is different, and the vehicle have pieces also used in ufo promos, like the space craft. It have translucent green pieces. The minifigure hangs a weapon, that can't shot nothing, but have a cool design.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-04T15:46:47.153Z","Hmmmm","This set does not look very much like an actual ship and it is reasonably small. The hover feature at the bottem is pretty cool, and the droid minifigures are always neat, especilally this blue one. His blaster is quite cool also.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"thenaterater","2008-07-12T21:10:30.7Z","a nice space set","i got this when i was a small child, and thus lost the instructions, but while browsing on brickset, came upon it.  i have used the robot in it to create many things, and it goes well with any space themed vehicle.  i think this is an awesome set, although small, and if available, you should buy it!

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-28T13:48:27.57Z","LEGO Space (UFO) - Cyber Blaster Review","The cyborg blaster is one of the smallest LEGO Space (UFO) sets I own. It's like an impulse set but it's also a nice army builder. We get a cool cyborg. I really like the blue skin on his head. It makes him much cooler. He comes with a gun and a speeder.<br><br>The built was very quick but you also get 3 ideas which you can build with the pieces of this set. If you want to build a cyborg army then I would recommend you to pick this set up - Even if ther're not so many playabilities in this set...<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
