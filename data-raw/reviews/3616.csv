I just loved having this set as a child, as it has one of those nice gray radar pieces!  The white space figure is also great.

I have to admit it was difficult if not impossible for me to build this set from memory as a child, but the complexity of this set only made me appreciate it more as the parts in this set are all good :)

I very highly recommend this set to classic space fans looking for a boxed version",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mjp_oz","2007-06-30T01:00:59.433Z","My 1st Set","This is my very first set, its what made me lego crazy. The design was great, so many things packed into a small package. It had a low count but you got a minifig with 2 tools both sat on the back one was the radio the other which you can just see was like a speakerhorn. This is a awesome set if you ever get the chance to pick one up. I recommend you do so. Otherwise just build one yourself from parts.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2011-02-23T10:54:57.77Z","While your mum's not looking!","<p>Name pretty much any Lego theme you like, and I bet you can't think of one that gets your imagination working overtime more than Space. Look closely at this&nbsp;model and you can see that it's made up of spare pieces left at the bottom of the box of a much bigger set. That's where your imagination comes to life. If you've got a spaceman minifigure and a pile of bricks you are going to come up with something really cool, then you're going to take it apart and come up with something else, equally as cool. As I've put at the top of the screen,'while your mum's not looking', is how you get these brilliant kind of sets into your collection as they were invariably available in supermarkets. So while your mum was pricing up baked beans, you could sneak one of these into her trolley, only to be found by her at the checkout, where you could give her a doe-eyed look and she'd let you have it!! Sneaky, but it usually worked! Get one of these off ebay or download the instructions for it because you've probably got all the pieces for it already. Timeless classic.</p>

What did the colours indicate job, rank or just fashion?</li></ul><div><b>Crater Strafer</b></div><div>So this skimmer or mini-craft has some really nice bricks. It was always a plus to get a 'Computer' brick and this build contains a favourite- grey with the red and green buttons. The black boosters/sirens/proximity pads (I can never decide) are always a welcome brick in the space theme and sit well with the typical grey aerial and radar dish, in this instance used for the shape of the vehicle like some vertical anti-gravity pad or skirt.</div><div><br></div><div>The grey steering wheel on the front, like other space mini-craft is a bit flat and dull but indicates some movement if a little functional over aesthetics. The name here says 'Moon Buggy'. Unless his wheels fell off this is not so much a buggy but a very good sample of the small Space theme sets perhaps more positive because a couple of front mounted laser guns are present although this brick was also frequently used for twin exhausts.</div><div><br></div><div>The only unusual design factor is that the control panel also looks like a seat or rest meaning the astronaut could lean back and mistakenly launch himself in to sector Beta-9 of some hostile alien system... if one were feeling over imaginative.</div><div><br></div><div>Another happy pocket money Space set but now a nostalgic collect or rebuild.

"beegeedee","2010-07-14T06:59:45.883Z","First ever minifigure when I was young","I got this when I was a kid while away at a summer camp. It was my most prized LEGO and also my very first minifigure. At the time, summer of 1981, it cost Â£1.35 which was a lot of money for a 8 year old but I used to play with it all the time along with the rest of my lego. It was the only space LEGO set I had.<br><br>The pros were there were various little models you could make from so few pieces. It had the little console brick which is just awesome and the little spaceman figure itself.<br><br>The only con is that with all space minifigures, the helmet tends to split at the front but doesn't stop with the fun.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>I actually prefer this little spaceship over many of the slightly larger, single spaceman ships.&nbsp; I can&#39;t put my finger on what exactly it is, but there&#39;s something very cute about it.&nbsp; Just compare the look of this one with something like https://brickset.com/sets/6842-1/Small-Space-Shuttle-Craft&nbsp;&nbsp; I just find Moon Buggy to be more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>I think 17 parts for the actual buggy... what can you say?&nbsp; It&#39;s a fast build; maybe 20 seconds.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>I would categorize 11/17 of the parts to be unique/interesting parts so this has a good ratio.&nbsp; The white spaceman is probably my least favorite of the classic era, so no extra points there.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Not much in terms of playability on its own.&nbsp; You can swoosh it at least, but you&#39;ll probably lose the antenna.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Not a lot of playability, but when joined with other sets, you could consider this decent value.&nbsp; Even if just raided for the parts, you&#39;d get a classic spaceman, computer, walkie talkie, space gun, etc.&nbsp; Worth it back in the day.</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T21:37:31.787Z","Neat set of bricks makes an unusual vehicle","<p>Not the most obvious design for a space vehicle, and on closer inspection much of the fun of this set appears to be in the possibilities for alternative configurations. Did we all rebuild this as a computer desk shaded by a parasol? However, it was a neat idea to build a small vehicle without the usual wheels or wings, and as such its novel shape is appealing.&nbsp;</p>
