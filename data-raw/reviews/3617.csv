What's he gonna do - drive that little car with wheels smaller than his feet then launch that missile at an enemy? He's gonna get wasted, but I guess thats what the common yellow space man is for,... cannon fodder.  And good god that black robot is evil, sent from the future dreaded Blacktron Lego and  is chasing you!  Run!  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

But really, this is a VERY tiny set with limited building variations. It doesn't even offer up much brick fodder for other sets.  Fun, but average.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing that this set is called a Space Probe is misleading as it looks more like a small vehicle with a missle ready to launch at an invading force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a Yellow Classic Space minifigure and a black robot that are included in this set, there really isn't much of a build due to the smallness of this set. It's very sparse on the number of pieces in it and what else you can create with it or use in other MOCs. It kindof gives me the impression of having been thrown together by Lego Designers that year to have a small Space set for people to buy.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,5
