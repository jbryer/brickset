Or maybe I should be rethink the visionary quality of this sci-fi comedy epic. Other than that neat set, lots of computers and bending Lego bits.     ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ra226","2018-01-05T19:01:46.723Z","Fun 'bot, lots of articulation, and a great parts selection","<p>The Spybot&nbsp;was a memorable little set from the Classic Space era and&nbsp;came in a two pack along with #1499, the Twin Starfire.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, this set is unique among space sets in that it&#39;s the only one that doesn&#39;t include a minifig.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if it was ever sold outside the two pack, so perhaps it was intended to be played with one of the figs from the Starfire.&nbsp; Parts selection includes a few tools, and tons of classic, first generation computer pieces.</p>

<p>This guy has great articulation, too, especially for such a small set: wrists, elbows, shoulders, head swivel, and the legs can bow outward to give him a sort of hover mode (I loved that feature as a kid).&nbsp; The rocket pack on his back as well as thrusters behind the feet and head all lend themselves well to the hover mode.&nbsp; I&nbsp;remember modifying&nbsp;mine to have a platform behind the head (swapping in a 2x3 for the 1x2 with bars) so a minifig could sit there and control him using the two antennae on his head as control sticks.</p>

<p>A great little set from back in the day.</p>

"JoystickJunkie","2020-03-17T01:49:47.533Z","A big robot, with lots of articulation, parts and heart.","<p>I found this set for cheap on Gumtree here in Australia - well, comparatively cheap.&nbsp; It cost me $20 bucks for this little guy in a Zip-Loc bag but apparently this was a North America exclusive set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comprises a robot, and that&#39;s it. No minifigures, or alternate builds.&nbsp; You get a robot, but you get a really nice robot who looks kinda cute and fits in well with your spacemen on the moon.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>The building experience is simply, working from the feet up to the head of the robot, with some small bits of sideways building for the arms.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing here that should puzzle or confuse you, but pay attention as you build as the old Lego Space instructions can sometimes be a little odd or condense multiple parts into a single step.&nbsp; Otherwise, you&#39;re left with a tall, chunky robot with lots of articulation, with a rocket pack on its back and some tool slots.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>You get some great pieces for your collection - three printed console tiles, two sloped computer screens with buttons and lots of small slopes, hinges, turntables, etc.&nbsp; There are no special pieces exclusive to this set, so if you do a &quot;Parts Out&quot; on Bricklink, you can easily assemble this from a stock of cheap, easy to find pieces.&nbsp; And due to many of the pieces being quite cheap and easy to find, you can easily get quite a few of these online by simply knowing which parts to buy.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This is a seriously cool little model.&nbsp; The arms can bend up and out, the elbows can bend and the hands, which are done with little brackets, can turn on their stud connection to the wrist.&nbsp; The legs, on the other hand (or other foot), don&#39;t have nearly as much articulation.&nbsp; The legs instead fold up outwards to give the impression of a sort of hover or rocket mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The robot is much larger than you think it is - easily towering over a minifigure.&nbsp; In fact it&#39;s so much larger that it won&#39;t fit through doors, or inside enclosed bases, spaceships or rovers.&nbsp; You&#39;d have to imagine this to perhaps be a large robot build to endure the lunar surface?&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s a constructor robot, built for heaving lifting, scouting out the moons, and exploratory stuff.&nbsp; A minifigure can interact with the computer panels, as if the robot is also a mobile processing thing perhaps?</p>

<p>The title of the set is &ldquo;Spy-Bot&rdquo; but I don&#39;t know how something so large is meant to be a &ldquo;spy&ldquo;.&nbsp; Maybe it can hack into computer systems?&nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s meant as a recon thing?&nbsp; Not sure who it&#39;s mean to spy on as I don&#39;t think the whole conflict in space thing was established until Futuron v Blacktron v Spacepolice thing.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>First off, ignore the &quot;set&quot; option on Bricklink as paying $49.95 USD for this set (Up to $80 Australian dollars) for this set is ridiculous.&nbsp; Simply buy the parts and build it that way, there&#39;s no special or hard to find pieces in this set.&nbsp; You can probably build this one for $15 to $30 bucks depending on the right Bricklink store.&nbsp; That being said, I have never seen this set appear on eBay or anywhere else so chances of finding a full set seem kinda slim.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think this is a great little set. Seriously lovely, great articulation and I could see it having lots of adventures with a mobile space team on the moon, whether in conflict or exploration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
