I love mini-flyers and IIRC this was one of the first sets to include the control sticks.  The blaster was a great mod too.  I think I might even still have the instructions somewhere.  I hope so.

With the use of a piece previously unknown to me the build is actually fairly decent and having an original blue spaceman is perfect for any&nbsp;lego collection.</p>

<p>The only problems are;&nbsp;having to navigate around the different sites to find one of these for a decent price, some of these pieces are slightly more brittle then-new bricks, so they need to be handled with care. Lastly, the build is extremely short and easy so there isn&#39;t too much to experience.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe that this set is one of the easiest ways to give your collection a piece of history.</p>
