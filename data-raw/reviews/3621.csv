"Rubberducky","2006-07-01T09:44:09Z","WOW","I was looking through my instructions when i found this set, im 15 and WOW ive got a set thats over 20 years old. my big brother was born in 1989 so my parents didnt buy it for him, they must of got it for themselves lol. WOW. i think that the classic space sets where the most imaginative in the whole history of lego. in those days if they needed a..gun then they would work out how to make it from old pieses but now they just make a new piese. back to this set, my like they are the sort of thing you would see in a movie see aload of space martians come over a hill. overall a good set that works well on its own and with other sets",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

You get 6 missile bottoms, four of which are light gray, two the very rare (not to&nbsp;mention&nbsp;rather cool) transparent red. Also included&nbsp;are two yellow pipes, these are rare at the best of times, and you certainly can't get them in this colour now-a-days.&nbsp;The not-so-rare-yet-still-hard-to-find parts are the seat, three black 1x4 offset plates (<a href=""http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/4590"">4590</a>), two green 'discs' and two levers.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigure</b></div><div>Not much to say really, it's the 'red' classic space man, who comes with air-tanks and the old 'no-visor' helmet.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall</b></div><div>Looking at the picture of this on Brickset I thought ""that looks rubbish"", however after having it bought for me as a Christmas present I withdraw my opinion.

Yes, if you can get this for 2-3 pound off eBay it's very good value (even more so if you buy another set off the seller).

"T79","2016-02-01T10:24:47.317Z","Hop on, hop off. Hop on - well, you get the idea","<p>When I was a child this set was never among my favourites, it seemed like such a waste of perfectly fine pieces to just use all of them on this small chair - they had to be used for grander things! A good number of years later and&nbsp;some sons of my own, maybe it&#39;s time to take a second opinion: this weekend we built all sets we have from 21 up to and including 25 pieces, from 1974&#39;s #612 Tipper Truck (honourable mention for this one as it was the first one they chose to build <em>and </em>still was a tempting choice between all the other&nbsp;small sets)&nbsp;to 2008&#39;s #5616 Mini-Robot (looks a bit like Wall-E!). While #6009 Black Knight and #5612 Police Officer (the dog, really) were tempting they went with this Surface Hopper in the end, traitors under my own roof!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Again, a standard small folding sheet with the usual moon background used for space sets. Par for the course it shows some alternatives of questionable quality although the lack of generic bricks and plates makes it hard to do something different.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, there is not one standard brick or plate to be found in this set, the part selection is as outrageous as the piece count is humble: the entire chair is built out of four 1 x 4 plate with two offset studs, a space chair, six round bricks with fins (four in grey -&nbsp;this is the greatest quantity of them in any one set except for&nbsp;DACTA -&nbsp;and two in trans-red) and, saving the best for last, two trans-yellow hoses. These only appeared in a good handful of sets and this is the smallest set they came in.&nbsp;Two trans-green 2 x 2 dishes (my favourite colour for this part back then), a robot arm&nbsp;and two levers and all parts are mentioned.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just one red classic space astronaut, this time he comes with a robot arm which gets pimped with a trans-green dish to make a scanner/blaster/signal detection array/whatever. The Surface Hopper is controlled by two levers and the astronaut can only manipulate one when he has his tool in hand.&nbsp;I wonder if this was intentional on the designer&#39;s part but since this tool is a robot arm the astronaut could still grip the lever with his tool in hand!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Real quick, put those offset plates on the chair, use the bricks with fins on those offset plates and then connect some of them&nbsp;using the hoses. Even for a small set like this there is nothing special to it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Another one of those queer-looking classic space sets (cfr. #6882 Walking Astro Grappler) and it is on those grounds I dismissed this as a child, fortunately my children have more sense than their father ;)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Well, this was chosen as the set they would keep if forced to pick just one and I think the competition in this group (21-25 parts) was pretty stiff so enough said! I did expect more from #6245 Harbour Sentry though...</p>
