Robot with moving arms is a unique design, and tiny spacecraft includes some unusual pieces as well as a handheld radio and pilot's seat.  This is about as small as you can go and still have a fully entertaining set.  Limited building possibilities due to the small piece count, but the robot pieces add some interest.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Here's one from top of the pile where grey space bricks and an innovative design make a hover-rocket pod and a robot sidekick. In theory could sound ambitious but two ace models are made from a small pile of bits and pieces.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Blue spaceman.</li><li>Very good mini build droid.</li></ul>Interestingly built robotic characters count as minifigures on brickset and this one joins a cool blue spaceman&nbsp;who reappears in other outstanding sets.</div><div><br><div><b>The Pod</b></div></div><div>Those under hanging four stud by two stud chamfered grey sections measure two plates high and are put to clever use as frame or structure for a grey space seat to click in to. A grey plate makes a solid base under the build. A black circular offset projects from the back with red transparent booster jets while a grey equivalent forms supportive stabilisers at the bottom with green landing lights - nice.</div><div><br></div><div>Two hinged control sticks line the arm rests of the 'XT-5' pod and make for a neat way to ride around the cosmos. The head rest area holds a favourite of printed tiles, a two stud space button pad element for working all sorts of features of course. An antennae projects from the rear of the seat for a typically simple communications device. Thus the pod can float and bob around the surface of planets or bravely through the depths of space with radar and contact.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Droid</b></div><div>This strange little creature has a funny 'face' but is an excellent addition as are almost all built robot characters in space. A vent or grill print on the slanting brick is attached by black headlight bricks holding grey eye studs and twin antennae. The reliable counterpart holds black tubes at the rear (fuel tanks maybe) and sits on a four stud grey plate and simple black circular base for jumping around on. The holder piece arms are suitable if a little handicapped and forms a function on the blighter.</div><div><br></div><div>These two characters are perfect together in a gem of a set. Only a couple of other mini Space sets will match this one as indicative of the theme though this model displays more variant bricks and colour. Such changes were developed by 1987 but they enhanced a great theme and did no damage, adding detail to the ethos.&nbsp;Reviews that gush can be off-putting but without any overstatement, among the best of mini-spacecraft, these are stellar models from a galactic set.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,3
"BrickLanders","2018-06-14T23:15:53.11Z","A tiny joy for a big universe","<p>This is one of my favorite sets from the classic Space theme&nbsp;(1978&ndash;1987) because it delivers a lot of joy in such a small package.</p>

<p>While many classic&nbsp;Space sets included&nbsp;flying vehicles, this set is unique in offering&nbsp;a hovering chair that is evocative of NASA&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Maneuvering_Unit"">Manned Maneuvering Unit</a>, which has become an iconic symbol of space exploration through the famous photo of astronaut Bruce McCandless piloting it in 1984. To give the chair the illusion of hovering as it sits on&nbsp;my shelf, I added a transparent stand made of parts 3960 and 30359, which were used in set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7121-1/Naboo-Swamp"">7121-1</a> (Naboo Swamp) for the same effect.</p>

<p>The blue color of the minifig&#39;s spacesuit provides a striking and uplifting&nbsp;contrast to the&nbsp;largely neutral-tone set.</p>

<p>The set also includes a robot that is charmingly retro-futuristic in its design, complete with rabbit-ear antennas and laterally rotating arms. You can almost hear its speaker uttering, &quot;Danger! Danger!&quot; in a canned monotone while the robot wobbles back and forth with anticipation. But the best part about having a robot companion is that you don&#39;t have to explore space alone.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-01-13T07:16:48.923Z","Very Unique Classic Space Set","<p>So I&rsquo;ve just pieced together a bunch of smaller Classic Space sets on Bricklink&nbsp;that I could get for a few bucks each. This is the one set that broke my price rules as it contains 2 printed tiles which were rather expensive. I made the exception because of how unique this set is, and let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m glad I did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First the robot is very different from the other robots I have as he is much more substantial. He has a 2x2 footprint and is a rather large build (15 bricks). He is a wonderful addition to my collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there is the main build. It is rather unique as it isn&rsquo;t a spaceship, terrestrial vehicle, or base. Instead it is a flying seat for space walks. And despite its appearance in pictures, it is actually a decent size and even looks good without an astronaut sitting in it. It&rsquo;s not just a chair, it is actually believable that it could be used to maneuver an astronaut thru space. The only issue is that the astronaut is unable to hold the rigid controls, but I&rsquo;m ok with this because using antennas instead would not have looked very good, the controls appear to be at the proper minifigure scale, as is the entire model. It isn&rsquo;t like the small ships with an astronaut just sitting on the outside out of necessity of it having a low brick count.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither build really works too well on its own, and they don&rsquo;t work well together either. But as part of a larger fleet, both of them are wonderful additions. If you already own a lot of classic space, and are looking for something that is truly different from everything else you own, I highly recommend this little set.&nbsp;</p>
