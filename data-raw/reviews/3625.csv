"Bumblepants","2009-08-15T22:25:42.327Z","One of the first sets I ever got","Apart from bulk buckets of basic bricks, this was one of the first Lego sets I got as a 5 year old. Not too much going on with it since it is such a small set but still a good one. The folding wings and adjustable thrusters are really nice touches. The black rockets on the sides and the blue laser/blaster on the front make things interesting and fun for playing with. Lots of versatile pieces that made good components of larger creations later on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dim","2010-03-09T13:36:33.733Z","Black Futuron dude!","<p>This was the smallest set of the beloved Futuron series and as such there isn't much to write about. Hinged wings and rear thrusters is all one got with this set. Overall shape was nice, but within this excellent series, it did not stand out. </p>
<p>However this set had&nbsp;its peculiarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>-It has a printed slope with the Classic Space badge reinforcing the idea that Futurons&nbsp;were the direct replacement of Classic Space. The only Futuron set to bear this insignia directly on the vehicle and not only on the jumpsuits.</li>
<li>-It comes with a black Futuron. I just realized that this is one of only two sets (excluding minifig sets)&nbsp;with a black dude. It's worth it only for this as black Futurons were the nicest, I think. Strangely enough none of the big Futuron sets came with black astronauts, whereas usually in the Classic Space series, black astronauts were reserved mostly for the&nbsp;more upmarket&nbsp;sets.</li></ul>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-11-05T19:41:35.89Z","Fast little troublemaker","So I won this on eBay today in a mixed lot.  I actually wanted the 2 Blacktron figures the seller had in the lot (instead of the Futuron minifig it comes with) and I honestly thought this was just some little ship he had cobbled together out of spare parts. But after I started researching it here at Brickset I discovered it was an actual set.

I really like how the wings and the tail fold up to cut the size in half.  It's like a portable one man drop ship you can hook to a larger craft for deployment.  Then four little engines and three laser cannons open up for some serious damage. And even though there aren't many pieces in the set, there is a nice variety of parts for creativity. 

For 35 cents I am very impressed with my lucky purchase!  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-09T15:33:31.51Z","Laser Ranger Review","<p>Outside of Classic Space, this was the first theme for Space that Lego began to introduce with Futron. You get one Black Futron minifigure and a space ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was alright, the rear thrusters show an interesting use for the lego chalices that have normally been seen in Castle as Yellow. The side wings fold up and down for a slightly better range of attack against an enemy ship. The build's not bad and decent.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5
"sf1378","2013-04-28T11:02:33.52Z","Great to own for a small set","<p>My late Mum bought me this set on a food shopping trip we went on one Summer from Tescos toy department in 1989.&nbsp;</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Yesterday I noticed the spacecraft, still intact after all these years gathering dust and dirt in my spare room; I decided to take it downstairs and clean it up with &nbsp;few days soak in Fairy Liquid and water in a bowl. I found the mini figure body and replaced the head with a new classic smiley face and cleaned him up too. The Laser Ranger is currently drying off now in the kitchen.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Its actually a lovely smaller pocket money set from a time when Lego didn&#39;t rely on stupid licenced over-priced rubbish; when a child them self could buy Lego with their own money ora parent buy as a small treat on a day out as my much missed Mum did. I chose a Space set at the time as a change and have to admit I never really appreciated it but I do now.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Having read other reviews I see its all the more special as its one of the few sets to include a black uniform spaceman figure. I like the movable parts basing all my ratings on its value at the time it was released. &nbsp;Compared to current small sets it is far more value for money. I reckon 3 or 4 of these would make a nice interceptor or small patrol fleet.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I wish Lego would bring back this iteration of &#39;Futuron&#39; Space theme. Saying that I&#39;ve always felt these were the same generation as the original Spacemen but with newer uniforms.</div>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>A basic design and easy to build with&nbsp;several nice features. The sloped brick on the nose had a printed Futuron&nbsp;logo and below it was a space wing brick with two blue circular light bricks&nbsp;making a cool looking laser gun. The wings&nbsp;could be moved on hinge bricks up and down. You had to be careful not to raise them too much though, otherwise they would press against the pilot&#39;s airtank and push him out the cockpit! The wingtips featured poles with red dishes on the end, either communication antennas or more lasers!&nbsp;I really love how they used goblet pieces as rocket nozzles and they could be adjusted up and down on a hinge brick too. The controls are two antenna sticks.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A figure with a black Futuron&nbsp;torso, black trousers, a black helment with a blue visor&nbsp;and an airtank.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I modernised&nbsp;the cockpit with a spare 1x2 printed computer brick and I put extra red circular lights in the goblets as a rocket exhaust. It was an ideal little fighter spaceship. When parked up the folding wings and rockets reduced the overall size and I wish I&#39;d managed to fit this into a large spaceship as some kind of pod vehicle. Overall this is a neat little spaceship and is probably one of the better small Futuron&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>
