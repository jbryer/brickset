"Blade","2007-09-14T02:55:50.357Z","Better than a Nissan","This is one of my really old models that I spent alot of time as a kid with. It is a classic space craft with lots of detail. Also I am shocked that out of 220 people no one has given this awesome model a review and am glad to be the first.

It has the standard big body piece with the wings clipped on underneath. The front has two blasters, venting on the side, an areal and a rocket exhaust at the back. The vehicle is controlled by a steering wheel and a leaver at the side of the seat.

The mini-fig is wearing white pants with a red jacket bearing the M-Tron logo, standard face and Black helmet with a fluoro yellow visor. He also has a black oxygen tank on his back.

Overall its a great model for its age, with lots of detail, very aesthetically pleasing and gave me many hours of play. So I am giving this model a 6/10 or above average. It is a must for any space collection, so go check ebay and bricklink today if you dont have one already.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It's the classic boxed ship that you got when you were little and you parents didn't want to buy anything big.  The m-tron logo on the front nose is awesome.  The figure, antenna, rear booster, and the peice selection make it even cooler.  Overall, it's cheap to this day and a classic space set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2009-04-16T13:17:25.233Z","Nearly perfect!","For a small set, this is near perfection. Not only does the aircraft on itself look very 'smooth' and well-proportioned, but the way it fits into the M:Tron theme is almost staggering: everything is there! The red parts (with logo!), the black parts, enough trans-yellow-green and of course the minifig. If only that steering weel had been replaced...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Xwing250","2008-08-25T04:27:05.483Z","Super Set!","I loved this set so much I bought 2 of them! The rednosecone piece is cool with the M logo on it. I now have built a sweet M-Tron Collection up with Beacon Tracer and Mega core Magnatizer. M-Tron has to be one of my favourite lego themes of all time!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-02-27T10:54:11.437Z","Awe, isn't he cute?","This was a bit of a funny set. The Voyager that came out was huge and had a cockpit and then came this little ship that did not have a cockpit, or any protection for the pilot.

It matters not!  The M-Tron line was great, and so many unique pieces.   One of the best features was the M logo on all of the ships that WERE NOT STICKERS!  That was great, meaning when I got this set when I was 12, I did not have to put on a sticker that I look at 17 years later that may have been left crooked.

It would have been nice if it had some kind of magnet with it so it could also pick up the equipment that the larger vehicles could.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-10-26T19:11:17.61Z","Like snowmobile without the snow!","A great mini ship at $3.00 (originally) with amazing parts. If I could make any change, I'd swap the steering wheel for a control panel like in the m:tron droid. The nose is large and bulky, but is a very usable part. The control lever (which cannot be seen from this side) is an added touch of detail, and the cylindar with tail fins is a great part. To top it off, the set also includes a radio and two blaster\headlights as well as landing gear.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-09T10:57:57.24Z","M-Tron Mkay","<p>Here we have the M-Tron small flyer. Perhaps they were African and its pronounced Mtron. Either way these sets were popular and the &#39;M&#39; represents magnets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><b>[</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;][</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;][</b><b>&middot;</b><b>&middot;]</b></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Space could best the iconic designs of the theme&#39;s early astronauts and Blacktron and so on but none the less, these suits were pretty cool and the early bright flourescent&nbsp;green never left the range since. Red &#39;M&#39; on chest.</p>

<p><strong>Magnetic Pulse</strong></p>

<p>So these small flyers and crafts were always popular pocket money sets and sold well no doubt. Very playable, the one character and craft makes a favourite&nbsp;for kids who enjoy a small build that gives a good result. The often used sloping nose piece in red makes a good front and as part of Lego&#39;s sci-fi&nbsp;ethos, it is standard to wear a space suit at all times and ride open top craft.<br />
<br />
I would have like M-Tron to deserve at least one magnet in every set so they could all &#39;lock-on&#39; but the green flourescent&nbsp;aerial and rocket booster with front lights/guns is enough pizzazz to please most adventures. Happy magnet hunting!</p>

"AETerry","2011-02-10T14:05:16.84Z","Pulsar Charger Review","<p>I wanted to be excited about the entire M-Tron theme but eventually decided no. Still there were a couple sets I got, mostly the small ones. And this one wasn't bad for the ship, solid little sleek build. The red and neon yellow that characterizes M-Tron ships. I was always amused by the fact this ship has a steering wheel for controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good ship, M-Tron just ended up not being for me.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5
"clundsberg","2011-05-24T22:17:39.45Z","I'm from the future!  A future where magnet technology rulez!","<p>It's true.&nbsp; I am from the future and I hate to tell all of you steering wheel haters this, but we still use them.&nbsp; It makes it easier to fly around then those weird joy-stick looking shifters, plus there is a niftly lil lever on the side to help with control.</p>
<p>Now, what my main gripe is with my one and only M-Tron set is that THERE IS NO MAGNET!&nbsp; Oh wait, before I say that let me do the fridge test.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>ok, yeah, no magnet...not even hidden within the figure.&nbsp; Poor lil Pulsar Charger went flying right past my Bricktober Knight and Retro '78 Spaceman mini figs (all of them smiling the whole while) So more like G-Tron (for Gravity) in this case.</p>
<p>However, my snarkiness aside, this is one very sturdy-cool set. (as also demonstrated by that fridge test)&nbsp; Even the most breakable of pieces (that long glowey antenna) is stabilized with an extra lego piece that holds it on the base and to the main frame of the ship.</p>
<p>The black/white/red colour scheme with neon yellow highlights is pretty smart too.&nbsp; It's the colours one thinks of when the word photon or pulsar is used.&nbsp; You know I'm right.</p>
<p>The mini fig is great too with his white slacks n sleeves an dhis M-Tron logo'd shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;A nice helmet with neon visor completes his spacey look.</p>
<p>The delta-wing design and the printed label on the sleekly&nbsp;modeled defense ship adds that touch of current technology reality to make this seem like a believable vehicle...er...I mean these things are real since I'm...from...the future n all....</p>
<p>GO MAGNETS!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"ezehogan","2014-01-19T19:10:59.073Z","Great Impulse Set","This was the first LEGO set I ever owned. My mom brought it home from a shopping trip at some point in 1990 and surprised me with it. I remember my mom and grandma really wanted me to get into LEGO sets around this time. They must have considered them to be educational toys.<div><br></div><div>I don't think anyone can have unrealistic expectations about these small sets. These were meant to be impulse buys to get LEGO pieces into the hands of kids at an affordable price. So even though I am not a fan of the space sets where the pilot is exposed, I can understand why it was done as a cost cutting measure.</div><div><br></div><div>For 3 bucks you get an M-tron figure with walkie talkie, some interesting elements, and an adequate little craft. Not much more that you can ask for in this price range.</div><div><br></div><div>In my LEGO universe, this craft runs recon missions to scout for possible mining sites.

"James83","2017-08-02T16:06:42.803Z","Pocket-Money Rocket","<p>This little pocket-money set looks good and offers good value.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This is another good looking M-Tron set, tiny but with some neat features. The <a href=""http://peeron.com/inv/parts/2336p68"">2336p68</a>&nbsp;space&nbsp;nose brick with a printed M-Tron&nbsp;logo looks good but does reduce&nbsp;the number of bricks and build time. The pilot sits on a bracket brick which provides room to sit with the airtanks still attached. The lever attached the left-hand side is a neat touch but the steering wheel feels out of place when all the other M-Tron&nbsp;vehicles, including set 6833 Inspection&nbsp;Buggy, had computer panels. I really liked the four-poster undercarriage and the two green cones made excellent lasers! For some reason all the smaller M-Tron sets included hand-held radios but the pilot always had to carry them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard happy chappy M-Tron&nbsp;figure with airtanks and hand-held radio.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This is a simple set but is no less enjoyable for that and is well designed and sturdy. I replaced the steering wheel with a computer brick on a hinge brick like that found in set 6833 and later fitted a bigger 2x2 rocket nozzle&nbsp;and it served many&nbsp;expeditions and chased off several Blacktron thieves.</p>

"T_Lars","2012-09-23T14:45:35.423Z","Swoooooosh!","<p>There's not much I can say about this set that hasn't already been said, I just 
had to review it since it's one of my all time favs from my childhood. This 
little scout craft was responsible for providing me with several hours of back 
yard swooshing and exploring.  Weighing in at a featherweight 26 pieces, this set 
had it all for an affordable price with it's two front mounted lasers, large 
communication antenna, trans-green engine and weird lever on the side of the 
cockpit.  As a child the steering wheel control made perfect sense to me, but a 
couple of red and black control levers would have made it look a little better... but 
whatever. And even though I was more of a Blacktron 2 fan, this little guy usually 
won the battle against the slightly larger Super Nova II. <br></p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
"Mechatronic14","2021-02-16T11:58:46.07Z","The time before the dreaded stickers","<p>M-Tron sets overall are extremely underrated, although they had a short run. This set is very easy to assemble in a short time. The minifigure uses a similar design to classic space minifigs but has its own themes spin on it.</p>

<p>The colour scheme of black and red always complements one another, but the translucent green gives the set its originality.</p>

<p>Prices now for this set are really decent, It isn&#39;t even too bad to get it with the box either at between &pound;6 and &pound;39 at the&nbsp;time of me writing this.</p>

<p>It is even fairly easy to recreate with newer and easy to find pieces.</p>
