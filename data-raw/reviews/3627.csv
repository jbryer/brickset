"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-18T13:53:36Z","Best small space set of the 90s","This set is usual BT2, with the expected neon green parts and the somewhat silly minifig.  The blacktron jetpack and control panel were nice bonuses for a set this size.  What separates this set from the pack are its wheels.  Unlike newer rovers, such as the LOM 7301 and the 6814 tunnelator, it has the old metal axles which allow it travel more smoothly.   In addition, its hard rubber tires allow it to get grip on smooth surfaces.  rovers with plastic wheels just sort of slide along.  The wheels are the perfect size for the rover, unlike the 6814's (too big).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2008-01-13T09:51:44.717Z","5/5 no flaws","  This set is definetely worth buying.  It's a cheap way to get a white jetpack, a blacktron 2 figure, and some nice rubber wheels.  I like the antenna that is on the side.  I couldn't have picked a better spot for it.  Normally things like that would annoy me but this doesn't.  It also has a nice dish on the front.  What you see is basically what you get and it's really worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rgijaba","2009-09-26T21:37:28.92Z","Let's go trek some grids","While I don't actually own this set, I did manage to put it together. It's a nice looking little thing. Its wheels are much better than current LEGO wheels in that they don't pick up dust as they roll along. They're also very nice looking. The design is nice, too. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-24T16:43:38.263Z","this set proves that blacktron II wasn't a total fail","Like i said in the title i like this set better then most other blacktron II sets

Pros: simple yet nice design

whatever that blaster thing is on the minifig, i like it

cons: with the blaster in his hands the man cant drive the care

blacktron II minifigs aren't as good as blacktron one

"mi_ma","2009-03-06T06:40:40.247Z","Very nice litlle set","He is build from only few bricks, but looks really great. Antenna which is placed horizontal is great idea for so little vehicle. Many mini sets now looks really badly. Like made without any ide only to give you some pieces wchich have to be put together. This one is really nice. I love the rocket piece. I think he desrves 5/5 eve if this was very small set. I remeber when i got it from my parents on christmas...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-11T15:06:52.56Z","Grid Trekkor Review","<p>I think my main disappoint with Blacktron is more with myself in that I didn't pick up more of this theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good, simple little vehicle build. Small enough to rove along patroling or scouting without much possibility of being seen by larger ships. The blacktron minifigure is wearing a jet pack of sorts to allow him to quickly leave an area. It was solid, decent. I much prefer the more solid black uniform of Blacktron minifigures then this black and white uniform. Still, it's good.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,5
"James83","2017-08-03T14:36:20.037Z","Go-anywhere Blacktrons!","<p>I loved this little buggy, simple but effective.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This buggy is easy to build and is of simple design. The chunky balloon tyres look great as does the horizontal antenna and the movable headlight dish at the front. The controls are a stolen M-Tron&nbsp;computer panel. Although it looks high it is&nbsp;stable when pushed along.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Blacktron-II figure with a jetpack which was quite rare. I brought another one in a spares pack but I&nbsp;wish Lego&nbsp;had made more use of these across the Space sub-themes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>Being a basic design there wasn&#39;t much to add to this but it was a nice addition to my small Blacktron&nbsp;band of thieves. This set was probably worth the cost for the jetpack alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"NostalgicObserver","2019-05-04T01:34:29.197Z","Simple set but great memories","<p>I remember receiving this as a preschooler as something of an early Christmas present immediately before an airplane flight to visit family. I remember rolling it along the airplane tray table and, later, that it paired well with the Super Nova II when I re-created battles with my (fairly extensive) Space Police II collection.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very simple set but definitely carries some sentimental value. Five stars.</p>
