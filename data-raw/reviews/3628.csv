This set was kool with the raising canopy and the Space Police Chief but overall wasn't too interesting. The reason I gave it a 5 instead of a 4 was basically cuz it came with the Chief.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-06T12:37:24.253Z","Cheif in Charge","After reading the other reviews I new I had to review this one. The vehicle is slightly wide like most older models are  but still has nice shape in the top and undercarriage. The front block in painted on so that's a plus. The hatch is on a hinge but i had no troubles fitting my models in. Just make sure he is pushed into his want to be seat. (There is no actual set in this model.) Has the old school jet engines on the side and a tail fin.

The mini-fig is obviously the Galactic Chief of Police, with green legs and arms, black space police jacket and green visor. Face has eye-brows and a headset. He also has a megaphone which mounts to the top of the vehicle.

Now people said &quot;dose he shout at them?&quot; Well its a megaphone, so yes, I think so. Don't the normal police ask you to pull over first, over a speaker? Second if it was a gun/ laser of some sort it would be useless. Firing a handgun over distance is hard enough let alone from a moving vehicle, believe me I would know, but from a space ship, not going to happen.

I feel this model really needed some form of vehicle mounted weapon but as is his the chief, I would assume he has a fleet to help him, but for play purposes yes it dose need something. Also some controls would be nice for him.

Overall it is an old model and it deserves its credit for that. Also its a sequel set so it should be better than the first. I feel this model is a good one and supports a 6/10 rating. A nice addition to all space lovers collections.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Pros : cheif minifig

cons : well the design is terrible, the ship has no weapons, space police two has a terrible color scheme compared to space police one, and this ship would be no threat to blacktron.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T16:58:04.78Z","Fun, cool, minispaceship","I agree fully with Blade's comment on how a megaphone is in fact more important than a gun. To me yes a tile on the bracket/dash board would have made a difference, but the bracket is fine as is. The cockpit is cool and the set has nice parts, ples the double thrusters are cool. If you use your imagination, the front end of the thrusters could easily be laser cannons. The ship loses its last point because on its own doesn't have much to speak for. The tailfin is sturdy, but they do bend. The minifigure is cool, and the epaulettes give him authority. The set is uniquely designed, mostly since the two halves of the cockpit don't match.

Otherwise this is a great set, but for a miniset, there is an odd singularity to this ship, you only want 1 since he is the cheif, the real miniship seems to be the starion patrol or something...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"keexko","2009-06-21T06:55:36.543Z","Memories","I remember having this set when I was young and playing with it in the sand pretending the ship was crashing into another far-off planet.

Anyway enough about that, let's go with the review.

The minifig and ship has a very unique color of black, red, green, and white. The ship is only meant for one person. The chief of police minifig has a helm w/ a green visor, as well as a red, I don't know what you call it, over his shoulders.

They may not compare to the space police of today but the old ones can definitely hold their own.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Atuin","2014-09-24T02:27:06.53Z","Captain Magenta's Return","<p>Well, as far as I can remember, this was among my very first 10 Space sets, also being my first SP II set ever. Back then in February &#39;93, money for LEGO sort of was sparse for me, so I was quite happy to add it to my new 6814 Ice Tunnelator and little Blacktron II collection. That excitement somewhat faded, when about 5 years later I realized, that suddenly I had five copies of that set! Anyways, that experience was pretty inspiring for some thoughts about this set...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art (as usual) features the same photo of the main build as shown on the instructions. It gives a nice little angled view of the ship, showing of it&#39;s &#39;swooshable&#39; appearance. The actual box was very small, almost being smaller than the finished set (in all three dimensions!). A box size that is discontinued since about 2000 I think. I actually prefered these tiny, tidy little things a lot over nowadays oversized-mostly-empty boxes, but well, size sells, or so... :S The Side of it were mostly black, back then the signature color of the space theme. The back shows of some alternate builds for the set, a feature also lost in the present. The instructions were printed on a little foldout paper about half the size of an A4 page, but cut parallel to it&#39;s long side, making it looking a bit lengthy. Build-steps were like the average of that time, clearly distinguishable colors (well, ok there weren&#39;t that many to begin with). It had a tan/beige &#39;moon-landscape&#39; like background and a special text font for the build step numbers (like all other Space sets ca. 1980-1994), which was kinda neat.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts wise this set was a little bit weird I must admit. The size/appearance compared to piece count was achieved by using mostly relatively large and specialized parts, that somewhat limited it&#39;s alternative build options when used without other sets/parts. On the other hand, that meant, it had mostly somewhat rare or uncommon components - the trans-green windscreen for example is only found in this set and the larger SP II set 6852. The light-gray 2x4x2 SNOT-Block is somewhat uncommon too I guess, but haven&#39;t checked. The Large Wedge Plate used for it&#39;s front as well as the printed slope (ah... back when there were no DSS&#39;s xD) also come in handy for SP II MOCs, but might be hard to use elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is a point, where it becomes a little confusing. Having thought about it, I never quite understood, why TLG went so far as to make that guy exclusive to &#39;92&#39;s largest Space set 6984 Galactic Mediator, just to release him a few months later in a pocket money set, even with all his accessories (not usual see 6008 for example)!. Yup, that&#39;s right, this minifig is only available in two sets (although the only unique part is his torso). Featuring the same color scheme as the normal Space Police II grunts, their commander got a special black uniform torso print as well as a pair of red epaulettes, else he&#39;s pretty much the same as the others. Aside from his unusual green and white colors, both his visor as his epaulettes are fairly uncommon, mostly only seen in this series or (in the case of the epaulettes) Imperial Soldiers. The head is actually a very common part, seen in various themes from 1992-2004, including Aquazone, Space Port and even Star Wars. But overall, he looks pretty convincing as a little heroic space commander nevertheless. Side Info: According to this set&#39;s UK and Japan names, it seems highly likely the designer&#39;s intended his name to be &#39;Captain Magenta&#39;. Sounds a bit strange to be honest, but anyways a lot more creative than &#39;Doc&#39;, &#39;Pharaoh&#39;s Mummy&#39; or &#39;Royal King&#39; isn&#39;t it? ;)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Well, actually not much to say here... As said above, this set has a lot of large pieces for it&#39;s size, so it&#39;s done in under 5 minutes, not really featuring any interesting techniques. But, although some sections don&#39;t appear to be, it&#39;s actually quite sturdy, which is a plus.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Space Police II, like it&#39;s predecessor and successor was all about fighting and capturing criminal elements in a futuristic space setting. So that leaves you a bit wondering about this ship: Shouldn&#39;t it be a bit more... &#39;martialistic&#39;? Even with a lot of imaginations, its hard to figure out any weapons at all, except perhaps for the captain&#39;s handblaster (done classic style as megaphone, as LEGO SW veterans will remember^^), which can be mounted atop the tail fin, but it looks somewhat awkward there, being off-center and in a non-matching white color (looks cool in Magenta&#39;s Hands anyway :)) To be honest, it somewhat looks a bit like a rejected module of a planned larger model, a B-model perhaps or even an Idea book model, that somehow made it&#39;s way into a separate set. Besides the missing weapons it&#39;s other major flaws are the lack of any clearly defined vehicle controls (the 1x2/1x4 bracket most likely is supposed to be, but looks very unfinished) and the non air-tight cockpit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one must admit, that for it&#39;s size and prize, it somewhat has a very sleek shape, which greatly improves it&#39;s playability. Other nice little features are the opening cockpit (actually I don&#39;t like having to &#39;remove&#39; a part to put the minifig into something) and the ability to store the blaster on the ship (well, it could be a sort of communication antenna couldn&#39;t it?). Also comparing it to other sets of it&#39;s time, like 6833 Supernova II, most cockpits then weren&#39;t air-tight, so with &#39;a little imagination&#39; it actually is, nontheless xD The last big point goes for it&#39;s underside design - it actually has sort of one! Although this might be simply a side effect of it&#39;s weird part usage, it looks at least sleek from almost all sides - if you&#39;ve ever seen the underside of 6973 Deep Freeze Defender, you might get what I mean...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While it might not be the what you&#39;d expect an intergalactic police vehicle look like, it still has some appeal. It could easily be considered an escape pod like craft (thus also explaining the high-ranking pilot?). Or perhaps some type of &#39;super-fast-and-stealthy&#39; spy vehicle, to get information on those scheming Blacktrons&#39; next plans? As a parts pack it might not be the best choice, as the boat hull and wedge pieces are perhaps a bit to specialized. In case you are into classic LEGO sets, it can be recommended as effectively capturing that nice and compact look of those ages and in the right setting may display very well. Last but not least - If you are specifically interested in Space Police II and can&#39;t afford 6984, this should be a must have for you, as it gets you a cheap commander and a few special pieces in trans-darkgreen and light-gray - well as long as you can still find it cheap!</p>

"James83","2017-08-17T14:27:00.52Z","Captain Magenta's Runabout","<p>The Police Chief, much like his earth-bound Town counterparts, earned his own personal vehicle to travel around in.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>I actually quite like the colour scheme of the Space Police 2 theme. The large 8x8 wing brick looks good and using the boat sloped pieces for the hull is a nice touch too but the part count of this set is low. The canopy is attached by a hinge brick and is sturdy. A printed slope brick is also provided. The engines are attached using the 2x4 3-way brick and this reduces the number of bricks needed but makes it easy to swap the rocket bricks for something else if you want. The lack of any controls other than a blank 1x4 bracket brick seems cheap, surely some kind of printed computer brick could have been included? The craft features no other extras such as lasers or radio antennas and generally feels bare, almost as if the designers had a parts limit they had to stick to.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with Captain Magenta himself, a Space Police 2 figure with a different torso pattern and red epaluettes but has the same printed head as a standard SP2 figure. He comes with a loudspeaker, the instruction booklet suggests you to store this on top of the tail fin but this looks odd.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>Although this spacecraft is quite basic as a completed set, it is easily customisable. I added wings to the tail fin, two computer bricks in the cockpit, lasers on the nose and extra rockets to make this a more versatile chase machine. In summary, not a bad set but one that is a bit basic straight out of the box.</p>

"joshcvt","2015-03-19T04:07:31.307Z","Pretty ugly across the board.","<p>Green, red, gray and black. &nbsp;It&#39;s as if TLG decided after Futuron, Space Police I and even amber-monochrome IBM PC-inspired&nbsp;Blacktron I that they had exhausted all possibly-attractive color combinations; time to see what they could make us swallow in the name of SPACESHIP.</p>

<p>Well, not this. &nbsp;Even as a&nbsp;young Space Police devotee after <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6886-1/Galactic-Peace-Keeper"" style=""font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">6886:&nbsp;Galactic Peace Keeper</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6955-1/Space-Lock-Up-Isolation-Base"" style=""font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">6955:&nbsp;Space Lock-Up Isolation Base</a>,&nbsp;I took one pass thru this kit and decided I could stop for a while. &nbsp;The colors and stubby design were bad enough;&nbsp;j<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">amming &#39;SPACE&#39; into the print design once cleanly occupied by the one word &#39;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">POLICE&#39; was icing on the cake.</span>&nbsp; And the minifig, presumably the result of teleporting a corrupt, red-green colorblind&nbsp;Western county sheriff of the 1890s&nbsp;to an alien planet and feeling a misguided obligation to offer him life support kit? &nbsp;He disappeared, and he wasn&#39;t missed. &nbsp;I&#39;m chasing a new one down now only out of misguided completism, not because I actually want to look at him.</p>

<p>OK, let&#39;s quit beating the aesthetics dead horse&nbsp;and talk build and piece quality. &nbsp;Even for a&nbsp;kid&#39;s-allowance-priced set, this falls short. &nbsp;Large, chunky&nbsp;pieces with no real alternate use options, the worst of which was&nbsp;a giant 2 x 4 x 2 side-holed&nbsp;brick, and a generally stubby appearance that had started going out of style 10 years earlier. &nbsp;A single swept wing piece so you couldn&#39;t even reverse the wing orientation and play around with horribly unaerodynamic&nbsp;but perhaps cool-looking designs. &nbsp;No hinges save one measly 1x2 for the&nbsp;cockpit shield, so you&#39;re not going to be tilting anything off 90-degree angles.&nbsp; Wherefore art thou,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6810-1/Laser-Ranger"" style=""font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">6810:&nbsp;Laser Ranger</a>? &nbsp;Did your lessons completely escape this set&#39;s designers?</p>

<p>15 years earlier, the stubby, chunky design would&#39;ve been&nbsp;mainstream (though they would have blanched at the 2 x 4 x 2), and the color scheme wouldn&#39;t have been tolerated. &nbsp;8-10 years earlier and the design would&#39;ve been a bit pass&eacute;, but maybe you could sneak the color scheme (if not the&nbsp;minifig)&nbsp;in with all the&nbsp;mono-gray bricks and trans-green shields. &nbsp;Past then? &nbsp;TLG didn&#39;t seriously expect kids coming off the inspired&nbsp;Futuron and Space Police I themes&nbsp;to accept this, did they?</p>

<p>Give this set a miss. &nbsp;Give this entire theme a miss. &nbsp;Not everything old is classic. &nbsp;Sometimes it was bad from the start, and now it&#39;s both old and bad.</p>

"Explorer6890","2021-03-03T12:39:34.83Z","An Underrated Swooshable Classic Space Craft","<p><strong>Building experience: </strong>A simple but effective design. It is probably THE smallest space set ever with all the desirable features of a classic spacecraft -- a sleek shape reminiscent of the first generation of Classic Spaceships of &#39;70s (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/918-1/One-Man-Space-Ship"">918</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/924-1/Space-Cruiser"">924</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/928-1/Space-Cruiser-And-Moonbase"">928</a>), a cockpit with a canopy which can be opened, a pilot&#39;s seat which does not expose the legs of the minifig, and powerful-looking propulsion engines.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong> A decent sample of classic space and town aircraft parts from the late &#39;70s to the early &#39;90s. The Space Police logo is printed!</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> It is highly swooshable and surprisingly nestles comfortably in your hand, no matter big or small. The rough textured sloped bottom and the lines on the engines provide some grip and a tactile feel to complete the swooshing experience. A compact but sturdy vehicle, which can be carried around for hours of play without having to worry about any long protruding parts dropping off. The craft appear to be navigated using a dashboard with four circles on it -- it is missing a 1x2 control panel tile that would have made it more <span class=""headword hdb tw-bw dhw dpos-h_hw ""><span class=""hw dhw"">aesthetically pleasing. But hey, Classic Space is all about imagination, so it is not difficult to imagine that the printed peripherals on the minifig&#39;s head are some kind of advanced neural interface.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Minifig:</strong> It comes with Captain Magenta, presumably the leader of Space Police 2, who wears&nbsp;<span class=""deg"">epaulettes which were originally introduced in the Pirates theme.</span> The minifig is armed with a blaster, er, enforcement tool, which can be stowed away by attaching it to the red plate next to the seat within an arm&#39;s reach. Given the size of this set, what more can you ask for?

<p><strong>Value for money: </strong>Average, back in 1993.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong><strong> </strong>A slightly above-average but underrated set. An excellent example of how a few simple parts can be put together to invoke the magical feel of Classic Space&#39;s first generation of space cruisers in the smallest form possible for a minifig. If only it came in the classic blue and yellow colours!</p>
