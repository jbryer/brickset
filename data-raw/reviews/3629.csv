It was the first Ice Planet model I got and I loved the tires, even though they actually make the vehicle wider than it is long which detracts from its visual appeal. I like the more diverse minifigs, especially the first (and I believe last) appearance in space of obviously female minifigs, presumably the other groups are adept at cloning... The visors look pretty cool, and it's about time we had something different, although I wouldn't want my face open to the weather of planet Krysto! To its credit it comes with a full compliment of skis and chainsaw with chainsaw body (why's it called chainsaw body though? Why not ""weird M-Tron bit"" or ""Blacktron collective stick""?) and I like the way the chainsaw assembly fits on the front as a kind of steering mechanism. Quite a neat little scout vehicle, although it could use some kind of radar to tie it into the radar/satellite theme.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-01T15:57:10Z","First LEGO","  This was my first LEGO set!  I loved it, with the very colorful blue and white and great trans-orange colors, and those big wheels.  True, there isn't much to make with it it, but I still loved it and Ice Planet.  It's too bad the theme was retired by the time I was able to buy LEGOs, cause I got that in 1993 and then it was put in a closet till I was six and old enough to play with it...by  the way, does any one know what the name of the Ice Planet is?  I heard Krysto and Krystol and Krystos... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2007-08-07T11:32:51.537Z","Cut Down to Size","As a kid this was one of my favourite models. This is probably due to the fact there is a chainsaw mounted to the front of the vehicle.

The vehicle itself is quite cool with tires very equipped for the terrain, Skis packed onto the back and a dismountable chainsaw for those things that get in your way. The colour scheme is great with blue white but also the touch of black and fluoro orange, which really add to the aesthetics of this model.

The mini-fig is cool with full space suit and communications built into the visor. Unsure whether this is a girl or not. I always assumed it was a guy with a cool long fringe.

Someone else mentioned that the model is wider than it is tall, which is true but I dont believe that this makes it more unstable. Whichever way I play with it I cant make it tip over so really this makes it more stable which is good considering the planet they are on.

Once you remove the fig and chainsaw the model is quite plain but the model only has 27 pieces and was very cheap in its day so not much can be said there but the front bumper plate defiantly needed something there.

Overall I really liked this model and it gave me hours of enjoyment so I have to give this model an 8/10 but dont just go on what I and others have said, this is model that you have to own and play with for a true opinion. I would tell any space fan that doesn't have one to go hunt one down and any one who is a collector you need this as i have never seen another model like it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T17:04:00.92Z","Quick, nimble, definitely a scout ship","This mini vehicle is so small that if shrunk anymore would be too small to hold the wheels. These larger &quot;space wheels&quot; are almost necessary since it helps handle the terrain. This vehicle is small, cheap, and has all required accessories for the one minifigure. Whats cool is that the vehicle can use the drill on or off of the main unit, so the pilot can donn his skis and saw in the distance. The mounting for the skis is cool and provides a relief for the common &quot;rack storage&quot; where a pin holds the skis together. All in all this set is simple and interesting. A staple in any Ice Planet collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-11-10T01:17:51.087Z","Solid Little Set","<p>I liked the concept and introduction of the Ice Planet series... and it's slightly bummed me that I didn't get any more sets beyond this like I thought I would...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, as the title says, this is an honest and decent little set, a good build and great introduction to the Ice Planet theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a mini figure with snow shoes, an ATV with an ice cutter as you explore a frozen planet. The translucent orange suggested to me heat and a way of keeping a minifigure warm or keeping him from getting frozen solid in the snow and staying mobile. And then the white and blue contrast were perfect too for suggesting the theme of this series with the Snow and Cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just have to hope LEGO reintroduces or i can find more of these on E-Bay...</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T23:01:33.543Z","Tunnel Through Ice","<p>Set #6814 Ice Tunnelator: Moving on from classic Town sets I once owned we start on the second Theme of classics, Vintage Space. It's hard to tell from the angle of the picture of the vehicle, but I am quite certain that this is the Ice Planet 2002 set I once owned. Those four big white wheels and neon orange skis are a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really loved the Space sets I got, I was a big fan of interstellar possibilities. I didn't get as many as other Themes though, just a few here and there scattered about. In fact I'm still having difficulty figuring out which set my two Blacktron 2 Mini-Figures originated from, but I'm confident it'll come to me eventually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ice Planet 2002 was one of those Sub-Themes that really intrigued me. I always enjoyed the Winter months more than anything else so a planet of ice and snow to explore fascinated me. The Ice Tunnelator was a smart looking little vehicle. Obviously all-terrain and packed with a heavy duty motor to get it over the rugged frozen tundras of Ice Planet 2002... Or whatever the planet was actually called, I think the 2002 in the Sub-Theme referred to the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really loved those fancy transparent skis too, and the Mini-Figures were fun new Space themed figures. Sadly Ice Tunnelator was the only Ice Planet 2002 set I ever got. And as you can see it is currently on my wants list, because it is a must have companion piece to the larger sets from the Sub-Theme. Overall I'd have to say it's a well priced little set with a sturdy looking little vehicle and the parts are good for MOCing too. If you want a small set to represent this Sub-Theme in your Space collection, or simply dig the Ice Planet notion you can't pass up this little gem.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"James83","2017-08-18T14:57:28.083Z","All-Terrain Space Buggy","<p>This set is typical of the small buggy sets; small, easy to build yet enjoyable to play with.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This four-wheeled buggy is easy to build within a couple of minutes with only a few parts. It&#39;s nice the driver has a seat, the back of which the skis can attach to for storage. Cleverly the icesaw&nbsp;doubles as the steering controls. It would have been nice however to have had some orange lights or a vent brick on the front bracket brick&nbsp;rather than leaving it bare.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Ice Planet figure with male head, helmet with orange snow visor and&nbsp;airtanks. He comes fully equipped with an icesaw and a pair of orange skis.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This is a basic set but with the icesaw and skis the figure can roam around and have adventures, leaving his buggy behind. I added some lights to finish off the design and there is just enough room to fit a steering wheel if you wish. Its not the most exciting vehicle but there are no flaws that spoil the&nbsp;playability.&nbsp;</p>
