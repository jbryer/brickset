"StormSworder","2007-04-23T15:25:26.833Z","A real classic","This set was available to the UK (though I never saw it in the shops.  It was a special offer in 1988.  You had to cut the barcodes off the boxes of space sets you bought and sent them off with some money).  I think it's a really nice set.  It looks great and has a wealth of good pieces.  Rare, but certainly worth tracking down.

But, scratch the surface and its obvious it has some flaws. The twin cockpits look great with those fighter-style bubble canopies. A pity then that the only control panel they have is a printed vent brick each! Yes it was easily modified if you had some spare computer printed bricks, but I'm guessing when this came out you'd be left wanting something more detailed than a vent brick. Oddly more print bricks appear on the nose and&nbsp;ahead of the cockpits.&nbsp;Also the bottom of the cockpits had big holes in them (surely Lego spacemen need oxygen too?). The two red flagpole parts looked like giant lasers, cool, but they don't pass the enlarged nose-shield. The Flags doubling as canards look the part though. The two small rockets on the fin have odd antennas on the nose, and why is there a computer brick on top of the fin when the cockpits lack any controls at all? Also, the red cones to represent rocket 'flames' don't quite agree with me either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p><p>Two Classic&nbsp;yellow spacemen figures with airtanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>I added some computers and made some other adjustments but then cannibalised it for parts, including the cool canopies. Overall it looks like a cool Spacefighter but there are too many odd bits and flaws for my liking. This really should have been better, and when you compare it to the M-Tron and Blacktron sets of a couple of years later its obvious this could have been so much better. </p>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,3
"rab1234","2018-10-16T18:16:31.933Z","An awesome little spaceship to close out the real classic era","<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>I try to avoid reading any other reviews before writing mine, but I did notice that this has a 3/5 rating which surprises me.&nbsp; This uniquely designed classic space ship offers great playability, an interesting look, and lots of good parts.&nbsp; Along with https://brickset.com/sets/6872-1/Xenon-X-Craft , the Twin Starfire is one of the few small ships with an enclosed cockpit.&nbsp; Although I was never big on classic space, I&#39;d have to rank this one as one of my favorites growing up.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>This took longer than it should have due to having to find parts out of a huge bin over multiple days, but overall it&#39;s a very satisfying build and results in a decent sized ship for the number of parts.&nbsp; I always felt like the ship should have had a way to split in half using technic pins (a technique common in classic space) and that certainly would have bumped this up to a 5 if they&#39;d pulled that off.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>A good number and variety of classic printed space parts.&nbsp; The 2 blue canopies look great and unlike some BUSPS (big ugly space pieces), they could actually be reused in MOCs fairly easily.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Very swooshable and the double cockpits could provide good playability when combined with another craft.&nbsp; The inclusion of 2 spacemen automatically makes this one more playable than many of the single figure spaceships of the era.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know what this cost new in 1987, but assuming it was &lt; $20, it&#39;s actually gone up a bit in value so it would have been worth the purchase cost for that reason alone.&nbsp; 2 figures, good playability, and nice space parts make for good value.</p>
