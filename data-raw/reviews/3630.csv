"Blade","2007-07-26T10:39:31.52Z","Space Hovercraft","Well as i was digging through the box last night and dug this one out. I think the model is such a cutie. Small, cheap and interesting assortment of parts. The fig is very good for such a small model, which I really liked.

Instructions were very clear and even my little sister was able to complete the model quickly and efficiently. Love the blue cone at the front (There can never be enough blue crystal parts as when i was younger blue was the rarest colour)and the holographic map is just awesome.

My only gripe with this model is the stickers. God i hate stickers. Only for the fact that if you pull it apart they can get damaged and come off if you ever want to wash the dust off your display models.

Overall i give this little oldie a 9/10 and would make a great addition to any space collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"legoman4694","2008-05-10T19:20:45.7Z","nice","this set is good because it can be bought for less than $5 and is still fun. the figure is very cool. i have 3 other exploriens sets and all of there figures are practicaly the same. this guy also has a cool face with a silver thing by his mouth. also the piece in the back looks like broken glass which is cool and the star map is awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-08-28T19:55:05.187Z","Great hovercraft","Well this is an awesome vehicle. First off, let's get rid of my only gripes right now, A) a pre decorated tile rather than the hologram and a fossil tile in its place would help and add playability... B) the set has too much friction due to its bottom. The set could use a few skid plates to smooth out the set. and finally C) ACK, STICKERS!! (but not too many).

Otherwise this set is wonderful, including the explorien CHIEF and some great parts. There are tools, but only a scanner. The hovertron itself is cool, but when the minifigure is off it looks very bare. The Hovertron still looks cool, and the double jointed control stick is a new touch. The holographic tile makes for a cool imaginary interface panel for the pilot (like a touch screen). There is also a fan like panel in the back, which can be anything, but will always be cool. All in all a %/5 with some minor flaws, and a great buy too!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2008-10-14T19:47:35.513Z","Awesome","For me this set was pretty much free. Someone gave me a huge garbage bag stuffed full of Legos a few months ago in it I found lots of cool parts including, which I would later find out, parts from Exploriens sets(among others like some Pirate sets, and Parts that I believe go to the four Roboforce sets). Just last night I was looking at a picture of this set when I realzed I recognized some parts. A little less than an hour ago I looked up the parts list for this on Peeron.com and within 15 minutes it was in front of me, 100% complete.  I look at it now as I give you the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Really cool
Black jets
Silvery reflective stickers
Stickers already apllied(only apllies to me)
Laser is movable
Cool minifig head

Cons:
From this set? NEVER!

A great set! Get it now! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T23:09:31.19Z","Hovering in the Distance.","<p>Set #6815 Hovertron: Exploriens explored space and to do it they used many different vehicles. The Hovertron is a small hovering vessel designed to traverse hostile planet terrain (at least in my imagination.) and with it the Explorien Chief can safely collect samples from any strange new worlds they encounter. Or find the fossils that the Exploriens hunted for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hovertron vehicle model was a simple little thing built on a round plate and featuring not too many parts. That being said the vehicle was a nimble looking craft&nbsp;that one could have endless hours of fun with, and as a bonus it allowed you to get the Explorien Chief at a much more affordable price. The accessories were fun vintage Space based accessories. It succumbed to the great LEGO Purge and so I no longer possess it, but I do still want it, and one day I may do so again. That is the joy of collecting LEGO, passing on your favorite sets to those who can play with and have fun discovering a world of brand new possibilities. I may regret passing them up for a brief time, but I know they went on to a good home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd have to say this is one of those love'em or hate'em kind of sets. If you love it, great, but if you can't stand the thought of such a small vehicle or you feel that the price for it is ludicrous or something, well then it may not be for you.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-31T16:35:39.457Z","Circular motion.","<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Exploriens"">Exploriens</a> subtheme always struck me as being a little weird. I quite like the white, black, and blue colour scheme that the theme sports, a simple and clean combination that strikes a good balance between realism and aestheticism, and the Minifigs are likewise coherent without being either boring or unnecessarily elaborate. Unfortunately, looking at the theme as a whole, it always felt - even at the time&nbsp;- that the Exploriens were more of an idea in search of a design, and what came out was a bit of a hodgepodge of sets that feel like throwbacks to previous subthemes. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the Hovertron is among the smallest of all the Exploriens sets, and yet I feel that it's among the most distinctive sets of the theme along with Nebula Outpost (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6899-1"">6899</a>). Unlike most other spacecraft ever made in the history of LEGO Space, it seems clear that Hovertron was never intended for deep space exploration and instead functions as a light scout, which fits in perfectly with the ostensible theme of the Exploriens. It's easy to imagine a Nebula Outpost being set up on a hitherto unexplored planet, which then deploys a Hovertron to make immediate surveys of the nearby terrain. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hovertron's build could not be any simpler. What sets it apart from other small Space sets is, of course, the sexy circular disc that forms the base of the craft. A pair of triangular plates means that there's more than enough room for the Hovertron pilot to stand and navigate the little vehicle. The Minifig, incidentally, sort of has the feel of a superior rank to him due to the Exploriens logo emblazoned on his torso, and is somewhat valuable due to him only appearing in the largest Exploriens sets besides this one. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Advocates of interstellar conflict will note immediately that the Hovertron is completely undefended,&nbsp;making it a perfect target for any enemies of the Exploriens.&nbsp;But, haplessness aside, this is&nbsp;a pretty unique set&nbsp;overall, and a definite plus point for the Exploriens subtheme. What a pity that the other sets don't quite live up to the mark. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

"mcereal","2013-01-24T19:54:43.673Z","Explore the Unknown","The Exploriens was probably my favorite 1990s Space subtheme. I liked that they seemed more like a science team of explorers than heroes or villians. They sort of fit nicely as a neutral faction with the other space system subthemes. I always liked the white-based color scheme. The Explorien sets look sleak and refined.<div><br></div><div>That being said, the Hovertron is a neat little ship.
