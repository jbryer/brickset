When I first opened these I was happy to see that the insectoid came not only with a speeder thing but a helmet and blaster. Ive disassembled all of my &quot;buzzers&quot; permanently (I've lost the instructions) and combined the main part of the blasters with the translucent part of the engine and ditched the helmets.

If you can get hold of plenty of these do so, I intend to buy more in the near future.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-08T11:05:29.983Z","Beta Buzzer","The insectoid beta buzzer is a stuff that include some pieces for insectoids, like the green pieces, a control panel, the helmet, wings, jets, and a alien-like minifigure. The magnetic cristal too, a feature never more included. The minifigure looks like the UFO minifigures, and this is a great set for space themes, making upgrades, or increasing it on other sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-18T19:16:05.107Z","awesome wings","my favorite part of this set is the wings. i love them because they are like cyber wings. the parts are much better then bug blasters parts. it has a magnetic crystal which is very cool and the last one i have with a sticker left. some time i will loke for others with a sticker because its so interesting how they make magnetic stickers! the figure is very cool with its blue skin and detailed body.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

However, this set, while small, is great, and is a must-buy at such a low price. It comes with an ever-cool Insectoid alien, along with a winged ship packed full of goodies.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Insectoids were a brilliant addition to the Space Theme universe, I know a lot of little boys and some young girls really dig insects, and what's not to love about insects combining with space based LEGO? I like them mainly for their unique Mini-Figures and vehicle designs, I'm not that fond of the creepy crawlies in real life, but LEGO versions I can live with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Beta Buzzer vehicle was a small fairly priced set which gave you one Mini-Figure, one Insectoid Orb and a curious looking new vehicle, it may or may not be intended to resemble a fly. (With the laser weapon at the head I always likened it to a mosquito, even though I knew LEGO had made a set that more closely resembled the blood sucker.) It didn't take long to build and it was fun to zoom around the room with firing on unsuspecting LEGO Denizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping to one day pick it up again, the Insectoids are deserving of being part of any Space Theme due to their unique looking nature. And the orbs are positively one of the greatest LEGO pieces ever concieved. (I think the sticker on it was magnetized so it could be picked up by magnets in the larger ships.) If you're looking for a fun little insect based space ship to own this is one you can't pass up.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-12T12:14:13.927Z","LEGO Space (Insectoids) - Beta Buzzer Review","This set is a small set but it's a good set to get for pieces and for the minifig. The built is easy and quick and this model is very sturdy. It is fun to build this set and you only get one sticker which you have to put on the crystal piece which I've only seen in the LEGO Space (Insectoids) theme before. The movable translucent blue fins which are printed are really cool as well. On the front you can see a big laser and on the back you'll find the engine. The pilot is a cyborg who has a translucent yellow helmet and the blue airtanks. He also comes with a blue head piece which looks really cool. This set is really good for a small set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-20T10:10:47.557Z","Space vector. ","<p>Making a good Space set from a small number of pieces seems to be a challenging affair, and I've found that Space subthemes always seem to suffer from kind of mediocre small sets. If I had to guess, I suppose the difficulty comes from attempting to convey a very specific look from a limited number of pieces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beta Buzzer, however, rises to the challenge and succeeds magnificently. All in all, it looks and feels much, much better compared to its slightly smaller counterpart, the ignorable but equally alliterative Bug Blaster (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6903-1"">6903</a>), a fact that owes itself in no small part to the inclusion of the printed wing pieces that are unique to the Insectoids line and among the coolest pieces in the subtheme. It's flashy, and perhaps not an entirely logical mechanic for prolonged deep space flight, but they look great, and it's hard to fault a set for that. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lone Minifig is also a bit more interesting than the dark green one that comes with Bug Blaster. He doesn't come with the sweet UFO-style armour that his counterparts in the larger Insectoids sets do, instead sporting a bright trans-green helmet and a body that mixes blue and grey. I find that this colour scheme matches better with the smaller sets, where dark green doesn't make much (if any) presence, and so I like it a bit more. As with all the Insectoids Minifigs, the printing is superb and still looks great today. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The actual construction of the set is, of course, very simple, and the end result does a very good job of conveying a vaguely insect-like look, complete with ""mandibles"" and moveable wings. The only gripe is that the laser cannon at the front of the craft is off-centre, which could easily have been rectified by including another 1 x 2 blue piece with one stud in the middle, like the one upon which the bright green crystal rests. However, this is an easily fixable problem far from being a catastrophe of engineering. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a great little set and definitely one of the best of the Insectoids line. If you're interested in getting into the theme and looking for a starting point to test things out, you could do no better than Beta Buzzer. And if you already do have some Insectoids sets, this set should be next on your list for sure. It flies, it looks great, and its got a good number of special parts - everything that a small Space set ought to be. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"TheLEGOshogun","2012-05-24T13:22:52.413Z","One small step for lego!","<p>When you see these small sets it can be a beggining of a huge theme and this to me is like a mini celestial stinger. Its a lovely small set with a good price and the design is epic.</p><p>I dont like the fast the sting on the front is on one side. That was quite lazy, they could of added a 1x2 flat smooth with a stud in the middle to fix it. All in all a decent set and if I may say so a good army builder!</p><p><strong>Pros -</strong></p><p>Nice design.</p><p>Classic build.</p><p>Army builder. </p><p>Good minifig.</p><p>Mini celestial stinger xD.</p><p>Value for money.</p><p><strong>Cons -</strong></p><p>Buzzer is a bad design.</p><p>Could of made it bigger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading :)</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,5
