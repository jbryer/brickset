"Aaronlego","2006-07-04T08:23:37Z","It spreads fear and instant doom!","This awesome set reminds of some sort of futuristic tank thingy. It has 1 of the coolest cannons that I have seen in a space set! It also comes with a secondary gun, just like a real tank! The three wheels go over most any terrian! This is the one of coolest little sets ever!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-27T10:20:56.49Z","Planet Cruiser","Pulled this one out of the box today. Not one of my favourite space models but still a good one. The vehicle is quite steady and durable for a three wheeler that rides high compared to most space models. It has one primary gun that could damage the front wheel if actually fired and one smaller secondary gun. Both guns are detachable and are able to be held by the mini-fig. The mini-fig is an alien. He is a cool shade of blue with lots of details that make him look like a cyborg. 

The vehicle and mini-fig are missing some aesthetics which doesn't help it but on the plus side there are no stickers. Yes that's right the control pad is printed.

Overall it's a good little model to add to your collection but lacks some aesthetics and playability. I give it a 5/10 and think its an ok addition to any space collector or any general collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-08T13:10:18.437Z","Contains three big wheels !","These are the same wheels of a insectoids line set, but in the black color. In this set are three, also included with a blue minifigure, and translucent green parts. The red is little but still cool with or without this color. The minifigure's body shows a UFO logo. I think that these ufo sets have less pieces than mars mission but are more coolest, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-06T09:57:39.513Z","Human alert!","I got this when I was small, and the set isn't really that great if you ask me, design wise. It doesn't look very pleasing (the large wheels and improper placement of accessories). However, anyone who has this would be proud (including me) as this is one of the last original Space theme to be produced. (after that is was all Insectoids, Life on Mars and Mars Mission, which weren't quite Space, if you get what I mean). The minifig is excellent! It is extremely detailed and it is the best designed minifig in my collection, and I regret for biting the head off last time because it used to be stuck fast, now there are tiny teeth marks over the head. The pieces used such as the transparent pieces were zany and gives it a Blacktron look. Also, the control panel piece is printed and is useful in many MOCs. Overall, I would recommend you this set if you like Space.

"king_kahuka_14","2009-06-17T12:34:36.17Z","one of the greatest small sets ever !","I got this set for 2,25 euro in a store wich sells old lego.
I really liked it because of the really cool min.figure wich was included.
the min.figure is one of the most detailed I have ever seen and is the main reason that I bougth it.
the trike also really is nice.
it rolls really smoothly and the weapons are amazing.
alltogether this set will be a great addition to your lego space collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"United_Bricks","2011-09-04T07:38:39.98Z","Awesome parts","The&nbsp;UFO theam is one of my&nbsp;favorite lego&nbsp;theam's, because&nbsp;of its rare parts. I just recently saw the UFO sets on brickset, so I started buying a couple of them on ebay, this was the first UFO set I got.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The&nbsp;minifigures in the UFO line are great, the detail on them is&nbsp;unbelievable. You don't get that detailed minifigures now. The alien or robot that you get in the set (looks more&nbsp;like a robot) I would call a drone because it has no helmet, but I don't know what the real name is. First the head, the head is blue and is extremely detailed. The torso has blue arms and black hands, On the torso their is a logo which I think is meant to be the UFO logo (It is in the shape of the UFO helmets which you get is the other minifigures in the series).&nbsp;Finely the legs are black with more detailing on them.</div><div>The scout its self is nice, it has some rare pieces on it. A rare piece what you get in the set is a tile what has detailing on it, it is like a alien control panel, this piece is the first for me and I believe you can only get it in the UFO line. For the wheels you get three black&nbsp;off road moon wheels. For the gun you get a grey gun with a transparent round.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this is a brilliant set the minifigure is awesome and I would&nbsp;defiantly&nbsp;recommend this set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2011-02-11T15:10:43.723Z","Cyborg Scout Review","The Cyborg Scout set was part of the UFO theme that Lego did. I'm glad I did pick this set up, as I do like the minifigure with it and a new element print for a computer console. The rest of the build felt mediocere. the attempt at a tri-wheel vehicle didn't look good to me. But it was small and fell under the umbrella of impulse buy. So while the rest of the UFO theme didn't hold much appeal, this particular set did.",FALSE,3,3,3,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T11:36:57.707Z","Cyborg Unit Powering Up","<p>Set #6818 Cyborg Scout: Well, here's another review by yours truly of the LEGO sets I used to own before the great Purge. In retrospect seeing as how some of these were so small maybe I should have held onto them, because now I want them again, heh, heh, the curse of collecting. (The curse of collecting says you will discard and reaquire items for your collection at least three times in your life, or maybe just two, of course this is only my opinion on the subject.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyborg Scout was from the UFO sub-theme, which introduced us to some interesting new pieces in LEGO Space, as well as some great new Mini-Figures. This little vehicle is great dollar value, but it is a little bit on the short side when it comes to other elements. The vehicle is easy to build and fun looking, it has three monster sized wheels to roll over any planetary terrain. And the Mini-Figure is quite nice, even though he suffers from being bald, but he's a Cyborg not one of the primary aliens from the UFO Sub-Theme so we can let that pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd have to say that this set on its own might not be the best representation that UFO had to offer, it doesn't include any of the more unique parts that came out with that Sub-Theme IE the saucer sections of the much larger ships, and it isn't a flying type of space vessel. If you get it in a lot with other UFO sets then great, but unless you're like me, with fond memories of playing with it while growing up, then going out of your way to pick it up may not be the best interest.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,5
"Sobel","2015-04-12T13:02:38.607Z","Everything you need in a small land vehicle!","<p>First up, I&#39;m sure everybody knows what to expect from such small model. It has no special functions or &quot;special effects&quot;!<br />
&nbsp;But some vehicles in this category simply consist of a base plate, four wheels, a steering wheel and a pilot.</p>

<p>Now this awesome small guy has a cool tri-wheel-design with it! This is the first big plus. Then, this model features a stylish control panel and an impressive looking blaster for such a small scout vehicle. It also has a small detachable hand-weapon for the droid (cool design) to carry.<br />
The droid-pilot fits perfectly in its place, making the whole model very compact and handy.</p>

<p>Only thing I could probably point out as negative is the absence of some kind of roof or windshield, but I guess those droids are quite sturdy, so some planetary dust or radiation isn&#39;t going to harm them!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>One of the best small sets from that generation! A great addition to every collection of ground-vehicles and space models, if you don&#39;t expect something too special!</p>

"charliebucket","2016-06-13T23:00:41.347Z","strange... but nice!","<p>I got this sealed from Bricklink&nbsp;:D</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is smaller yet deeper than I expected, with the model on the front and 2 of the sides whilst the back shows 3 alternate builds: a mech, a spaceship and another type of rover.</p>

<p>Opening the box you will find 1 instruction manual, 1 leaflet catalog, 1 (small) bag of parts, 3 of those &quot;rover wheels&quot; in black, and 2 1x8 plates in black.</p>

<p>The leaflet has, on one side, ads for the Ufo sets and Exploriens sets, whilst the other side has ads for Western, Castle, Divers/City, Pirates, Aquazone, Train and Legoland.</p>

<p>The instructions are also on&nbsp;a foldout leaflet which has a basic green background and is easy &nbsp;to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only part of note would be the printed circuit&nbsp;panel which was very wll done for it&#39;s day.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The 1 minifig included is AMAZING! Definitely&nbsp;one of the major selling points of the set! &nbsp;Great prints for it&#39;s day.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Well, the build takes 1-5 minuets&nbsp;depending on how skilled you are at the fine art of building Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model looks, well, a bit weird to say the least, with the 3 wheels and all, but they still did a good job none the&nbsp;less.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good, but don&#39;t get it if the Bricklink store has nothing else you want, because it isn&#39;t&nbsp;a stand alone set.</p>

<p>I hope this helped you choose your next Lego set :)</p>
