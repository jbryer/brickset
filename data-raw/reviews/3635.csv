It’s the perfect compliment to survey vehicle 6841 – “you find it, I’ll dig it up” – and has many of the same strengths and weaknesses. 

On the con side, why are there manoeuvring thrusters? Where are the controls for the digger? And most importantly, why doesn’t the poor guy score some mud guards?

But the pros render all that meaningless. The car itself is poised, elegant and fun to play with. The digger digs, the walkie-talkie is handy and the whole little bundle has digging-adventure written all over it.

When my mum handed this little gem over it was more of the same. For some reason, I really enjoyed the funky flexible arm, and this kit had one on the front!

So two Lego sets in and both were digging vehicles of some sort. The kit itself is rather simple. At a pinch you could leave the antenna off the back and curl the shovel up over the front and zoom it around on the floor. That in itself made this kit a lot more fun. 

I had no problems pretending that 6822 'could' fly, but 6821 could roll across the floors at home...no pretense needed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I could never figure out what the yellow bricks were supposed to represent - was there gold on the moon? The downside to this set was that as most of the bricks are specialist pieces, there was little scope for alternative builds. However, it was a neat addition to our regular convoys of Lego vehicles and proof that a characteristic vehicle does not need a large quantity of bricks.&nbsp;</p>
