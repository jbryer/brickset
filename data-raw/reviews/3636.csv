Nothing special, but I have one!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blitzr","2009-11-14T22:54:04.75Z","For old times!","Looking back, this really was not much at all.....but it was my first EVER Lego model. As a result it still holds a special place in my heart.

It is a rather funny looking vehicle, but the flexible claw on the back was great fun when I was 7 years old. On it's own, it did not get too much play. Once I got a few more sets I used it a lot more, but also started to see just how basic it was.

Still, for a first ever Lego set, it made me smile.

I have given it a 3, although I think 3.5 would be more fitting.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-10-22T05:02:17.387Z","Death Dealing Cyber Claw","The bricks in this set are a good representation of the weird Space theme parts; under hanging jets, a brilliant robotic mech-arm with grabber and sirens/proximity pads/radar..what are those?<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>The all over red spaceman comes with a radio of course.</li></ul><div><b>Galactic Grabber</b></div>He drove this mini craft, one of many, to what ever missions you imagined.&nbsp;It sported an aerial and like much of 1970s/1980s sci-fi influenced stuff, was designed with strange mission practicalities in mind because there is just a steering wheel on the front, no aerodynamics needed in space and no room for cockpits.

<p>The Space Digger (6822) doesn&#39;t live up to some of the other sets of the era aesthetically or in terms of parts provided.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a fan of this one.&nbsp; There are plenty of better sets from 80s with better parts, playability, and build.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>Only 28 parts so it comes together super fast and is a simple build.&nbsp; Honestly this one feels like a typical 6 year old could put together something more interesting with a slightly different batch of pieces.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>It&#39;s got 4 of the engine pieces which have their uses.&nbsp; Other than that, the selection of parts is pretty poor with a lot of small plates.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>No better than any of the other spaceships and rovers and this one only has 1 spaceman.&nbsp; They tried to add some playability with the grapple arm, but it looks and feels thrown on as an afterthought.&nbsp; You&#39;d definitely need additional space sets to get any real playability out of this one.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>It can be picked up very cheaply on Bricklink and there are a lot of them available.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a completest, it would be worth picking up for &lt; $10.&nbsp; You do get a classic red spaceman which is great, but overall, not a good value in my opinion based on the quality of the set.</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T21:54:11.617Z","Great for sliding across the carpet","<p>Several space vehicles had alternatives to wheels for their locomotion, with varying success. This one worked well for us, skimming across the carpet to great effect (though having the right type of carpet no doubt helped). The grab claws were fun, and on several occasions we would try to see how big an object they could hold before being defeated. As with several other space vehicles with specialist pieces, this was limited in its scope for alternative builds, but as the original was so much fun, we didn&#39;t mind this at all.&nbsp;</p>

"Explorer6890","2019-02-09T01:34:08.39Z","A versatile ""space scorpion""","<p>I imagine this to be a flying multi-purpose utility vehicle with powerful engines to go where no buggy could reach -- performing mid-flight zero-G repairs, collecting rock samples from remote sites and even serving as a space tow truck or tug boat! The radio suggests that the &quot;space scorpion&quot; can be operated by remote control for hazardous operations.</p>

<p>While the parts are nothing to shout about, it is one of the smallest sets with a classic robotic arm as its main play feature.</p>
