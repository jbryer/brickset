"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-18T08:43:01.467Z","Utility Vehicle","For some  reason I had two of these as a child, and it was a great little utility vehicle to drive ""supplies"" from one base over to another with all my little Minifigs.  The hightlight is definitely back half of the vehicle with the compartment, and the hooks for tool.   The front part is just the steering wheel, which is kinda boring. A few more bricks up front would have livened ths one up considerably, but for its size and brickcount it's a decent rig.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all legos easy to understand.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set was small and easy to keep track of. I do not think it needed more than it had. Sometimes the simple sets where more fun to play with. Just use your imagination and you can go anywhere with this little guy.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One is all you need with a small set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Real easy to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Cute and fun.</p>

<p>It has a complete set of play functions for a vehicle this size -- hinged chassis for going on rough terrain, a detachable hand-held metal detector, a locker (actually a grey town letterbox) to store samples and an aerial which can be raised and lowered.</p>
