"Banched","2015-07-14T21:59:47.313Z","The original Benny!","<p>I got this in 1984 when it was on a special offer via the Lego Club (UK). You had to send off a coupon with a small payment i recall. I was really excited to get the first set with a&nbsp;blue spaceman.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>it had a box. Not anymore. I didn&#39;t keep boxes. But I did keep the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of interesting parts which were, as far as I know, new to space Lego in 1984. The wings, the boosters, the four pieces with holes on,&nbsp;I don&#39;t think any of these style pieces existed before 1984, and they made it all the more interesting for me. The moving nose cone was fun, and I loved the light-sabre like arial&nbsp;on the end.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s the original Benny! Was so excited to get a blue spaceman. A novelty in 1984.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy to build, but more interesting than many space sets of the same size.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great. I used to fly it around, and imagined that the nose cone stayed static while the wings and body tilted to steer. The only downside is that the red arial on the nose cone dropped off while playing with it a lot.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A favourite.&nbsp;</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T21:57:29.773Z","Interesting variety of parts","<p>Looking back, the big novelty with this set was the blue-uniformed astronaut minifigure, the only one we had. The vehicle is nicely-designed, but stood out as something of an oddity along our existing fleet. However, the variety of lights, rocket parts, and struts meant that we had a useful collection of accessories to build a more conventionally-designed vehicle with.&nbsp;</p>

"Explorer6890","2019-02-09T01:19:44.06Z","Loads of exciting 1984 parts","<p>The first blue spaceman come out in 1984, along with a flurry of exciting new space parts -- finned rocket engines, wing frames, &quot;space chair&quot;, &quot;space jumper&quot; and transparent red aerial. This small set is a good example of what those new parts could do. Highly swooshable -- a spaceman riding on a winged rocket with 5 engines and a rotating nose cone with a brand-new laser cannon, er, scientific equipment.</p>

"JoystickJunkie","2020-05-27T06:44:00.523Z","A decent little space craft!","<p>Classic Space is deeply revered by Lego fans, but I wasn&#39;t even alive for any of it.&nbsp; Classic Space came, evolved, changed, and then went all before I was even a thought.&nbsp; Futuron, Blacktron, Blacktron 2, M-Tron - all of this happened and ended before I could even see it.&nbsp; I think my primary school had a box of vintage Futuron and Space pieces in a big tub, although I don&#39;t remember much outside of that.</p>

<p>So with all that being said, I don&#39;t have much nostalgia for Classic Space&nbsp;- I&#39;m more attached to the mid to late 90s sets like Aquazone, Adventurers, Town and Bionicle.&nbsp; But, I picked this up for cheap from Gumtree along with the 1498 Spy-Bot <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/56178"">which I&#39;ve already reviewed.</a>&nbsp; So let&#39;s give it a look!</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This was a fun little build, with it taking shape quite quickly.&nbsp; There&#39;s lots of nice interlocking building clips, sideways building and it all comes together to make a nice craft.&nbsp; One thing to note with Classic Space instructions is that too often it can become a game of &#39;&#39;spot the difference&quot; as they don&#39;t really mark out what&#39;s changed in at each step so just make sure you&#39;re paying attention.</p>

<p>Once it&#39;s all finished, it looks really nice too.&nbsp; There&#39;s a lot of detail packed into such a small craft.&nbsp; There&#39;s even some attempts at greebling here (using small pieces to create surface detail) and the use of different angles, textures and shapes make a visually interesting form.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;m not a HUGE fan of is the nosepiece - it&#39;s all smooth, which really stand out as the entire craft has a very blocky, rugged look to it, so to go to a smooth cone nose just doesn&#39;t look right.&nbsp; I think another of those black 2x2 fins might have been nice.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Apparently, a lot of new parts debuted in this set like the chairs, missiles, finned pieces, etc but I wouldn&#39;t know about that.&nbsp; And to be honest, that sort of historical significance is a little meaningless&nbsp;because lots of parts have come and gone throughout Lego&#39;s product lineup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get a lovely black finned 2x2 brick to simulate a rocket jet, a&nbsp;light grey space seat, four space wings (Light Gray Plate, Modified 1 x 2) and some nice trans-green, trans-red and trans-yellow pieces of small size.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What makes this set great is that all the pieces are simple enough to be used in other constructions and not overly specialised or big, which would make them limited to certain usecases.&nbsp; Everything here could be repurposed.</p>

<p>The minifigure included is apparently one of the first classic blue astronauts that Lego ever made.&nbsp; Mine came in great condition, with no scratching of the gold print on the chest and no snapped helmet.&nbsp; The Classic Space figures are some of the best and most iconic Lego has made in my opinion, and their simplicity and colours make them work even today.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to rank this one because I don&#39;t know if what was included was &#39;enough&#39; back in the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But a space ship always has lots of stories that come with it, simply because space offers so much potential for story-telling.&nbsp; You could be exploring the lunar surface, scanning for minerals.&nbsp; Or maybe you&#39;re an intergalactic detective, armed with missles to fend off those who don&#39;t want you poking your nose into their affairs.&nbsp; Maybe you&#39;re just a messenger, or a scientist, or an intergalactic tourist using this as a space hire car?&nbsp;One thing that&#39;s great about the Classic Space sets is that they don&#39;t prescribe any story or &quot;way to play&quot; for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>Again, hard to say.&nbsp; I got this for about $20 dollars, and I think that was a little steep for a model this size.&nbsp; But then again, it had a mint condition blue astronaut, all the pieces were in immaculate condition with no fading, discolouring or looseness or parts that you usually get with heavily played sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this set is worth about $15 to $25 dollars on a good day, if only because of the age of the set and the historical value.</p>
