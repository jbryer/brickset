"AETerry","2011-02-11T15:15:36.833Z","Cosmic Comet Review","<p>Seeing Classic Space sets like this brings back a lot of nostalgia for me and a summer spent up in Canada visiting my Grandpa. I was spoiled and he got me a lot of space lego sets, granted small, but I did get a good dozen of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As blue is one of my favorite colors, this set holds a lot of appeal for that. Basis to the side, it's still a great set, it comes with a rare (to me) White Classic Space Minifigure and there's a lot of elements in this for making&nbsp;a truely unique space craft with lots of potential for not just it's original model, but other MOCs too. There's just lots of little details from joystick controlers, ""bazooka"" laser cannon that can be removed, lots of transparent pieces and yellow hoses/tubes. Just a lot of fun.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-26T05:10:24.767Z","The Colour Of Space","There's a reasonably strong distinction between Classic Space all grey models as opposed to set builds where blue was more dominant. Occasionally they looked contrasting with two tones or as here really rather colourful. As another of the mini craft available its welcome as yet more variety.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>White spaceman.</li></ul>He returns in pristine gear from head to toe as usual. Who could complain?</div><div><br><b>1980's Sci-Fi</b></div><div>Reminiscent of various cheesy toy and cartoon sci-fi in this decade, this typically open top mini Lego spacecraft gets all manner of colourful tubes, retros, laser emitters, gun nozzles, lights and dishes. The build is straight forward with some thankfully contrasting grey cylinders, erm 'camera' bricks (apologies, I wish I knew the name for these but they do not currently exist in the brick database) and the two stud with cylindrical offsets. The blue nozzle front or nose was never something I was that keen on even when decorated with a laser or antennae but I have an aversion to blue in Space sets and won't place bias against this at all. A space seat is the naturl choice for a top rider position as is often. The front yellow circular lights and red square wing tip lights begin to add colour while two grey control arms attach inventively to the small square holes each side of the space chair. The craft also gets two control levers in front as well so these arms are a sadly then a little redundant but display an interesting technique.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Two more craft fronts or frames are used sideways at the craft's rear for tails if you will. A rig of retros are built to fit these with bright red transparent cones for good effect. Its sometimes hard to decide whether Space transparent pieces are a 'special effect' like thrust or a solid bit of sci-fi hardware, it seems we each get to pick and choose. From here the once fluorescent tubes of energy trail down from the rig and connect to the grey kit underneath the craft, energy flowing all over this tiny flying contraption though it is not the smallest and is reasonably swooshable. Lastly the trans-red dishes make the nose ended frames look better while the front scanner/camera/gun is placed on a hook the wrong way round interestingly, and a couple more circle lights for it would have accomplished a shining twinkling flying 1980's disco effect considering just how much trans colours this set is packing.</div><div><br></div><div>The alternative build is not as good and ignoring a personal preference of the more contrasting grey this is a really good example of the brightly designed releases, I believe there are no better out there in these terms. Its a real sparkle of fun for the mini-craft and much appreciated, the white spaceman an appropriate choice in colour polarity.</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2
