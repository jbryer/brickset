So any Space sets I got were usually of my own money or a gift from a family member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was one of the sets I found to have the Blue Space Minifig and that's largely the reason I picked this one up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some good pieces to use in either it's original model or to pull apart and put into a MOC design. A very decent little set.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,3

<p>This is a decent little buggy with a cool blue spaceman and a couple of interesting parts and colors to it.&nbsp; It&#39;s not the greatest of classic space, but the white/black/red/green all look good with the blue spaceman.&nbsp; I also like that this is a classic rover and, in my opinion, a bit better than some of the awkward walker builds.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>Very fast build at 35 parts.&nbsp; Not much in the way of interesting building techniques can be done with such a small build.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>I like the trans-green dishes, a couple of unique hinges and of course the printed logo on the front of the buggy and blue spaceman.&nbsp; Considering how few parts there are, I still give this a decent rating for parts.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Not much you could do with this one without investing in more sets.&nbsp; Like a lot of these single minifig sets, this one gets a middle of the road rating for playability.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>This was one of those impulse buy items and would have been worth the money to keep a kid from throwing a tantrum and, later on, adding to a growing space collection.&nbsp; Spaceship!</p>
