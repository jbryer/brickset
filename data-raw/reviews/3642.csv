"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-06T14:10:59.437Z","The Beginning Of It All!","This is the set that got me started down the Lego road.  Without this set, I do not know if I ever would have gotten as into Legos as I did.  I was 5 years old in 1988, and I remember spending hours upon hours with this tiny little set.  It started the love affair between myself and Legos that lasted the better part of a decade.  Now, as I am out in the adult world, I have really come to appreciate just how much Legos meant to me and how important they were for my development as a young child.  I can confidently say that without my lust for Legos, I would likely not have followed the career path I have (I have a degree in Engineering Mechanics).  And, it is entirely possible that without this Lego set, my life could very well have wound up differently.  

I loved absolutely everything about this set.  The transparent pieces, the facemask on the helmet, the moving pieces, every little bit of it was perfect.

I think the best way to sum it up was that at one point, I was 5 years old, and I would disassemble this set and lay out the pieces in a certain order and then BUILD IT WITH MY EYES CLOSED!  If that's not loving a Lego set, I don't know what is!

This little one definitely takes me back and puts a big hearty smile on my face! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
