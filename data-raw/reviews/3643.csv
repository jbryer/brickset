This feature four wheels, translucent cockpit part and lightsaber like pieces,control panels in black, with gray parts, like some ufo. You can put the minifigure in the cockpit easily. Very well quality, playabilty and creativity. A classic, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It looks just exactly like a radar car should and it fits in very well with the rest of the theme. I really wish the newer sets were like this.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-10T10:04:07.437Z","Unidentified driving object?","<div>I have several qualms regarding Radon Rover. The first is its name: what does “radon” have to do with anything, really? Are we talking about the noble gas? Or are we talking about an arbitrary set being <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RadonMeasure.html"">Radon measurable</a>? I suspect that it is neither, which leads me to wonder what was going on in the nomenclature department on the day that Radon Rover was born.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second is that we have a subtheme here that goes by the name of UFO. That’s Unidentified Flying Object, as far as I know, so I’m not sure why the aliens would need an all-terrain vehicle when they have the capacity to fly around and abduct anybody at will. I suppose an argument could be made that it’s more efficient to take the Radon Rover out for a spin to go to the store as opposed to bringing out the entire Cyber Saucer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6900-1"">6900</a>), but I’m afraid I just don’t buy it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But we could even ignore those two points and instead consider the set itself. In my mind, there are two Space subthemes that succeeded very well when it comes to producing great-looking ground-based vehicles as opposed to flying ones that zip through space: the first would be M-Tron, with its impressive Mega Core Magnetizer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6989-1"">6989</a>), and the second would be the Insectoids, whose Planetary Prowler (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6919-1"">6919</a>) and Arachnoid Star Base (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6977-1"">6977</a>) both serve as outstanding examples of good-looking and thematically coherent ground vehicles with a variety of features. Now, one might say that it’s unfair to compare Radon Rover to these much larger sets, but I think that what the smaller M-Tron and Insectoids vehicles did very well was complement their larger cousins, which I do not feel that Radon Rover does.</div><div><br></div><div>With its open sides and weird angular pieces, I’m not even exactly sure what this set is trying to accomplish. What is Radon Rover’s purpose? Scouting? Espionage? Perhaps some kind of alien dune buggy? I don’t know. I suppose that’s up to your imagination. All I know is that it never felt like it fit into the UFO configuration, which is ultimately the biggest disappointment here. Unless you’re an absolute completionist or the most hardcore of hardcore UFO fans, you could probably do with giving Radon Rover a miss - and that’s a shame, too, because, for the most part, the UFO sets are all really good. Just not this one.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,3,3,2,3
"mcereal","2013-01-25T01:44:28.347Z","Strange Little Rover ","This is a weird little set.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>It's part of the UFO line but it's a ground&nbsp;vehicle. I sort of understand the point, some variety in the line, the UFO aliens need to cover the ground too, I guess.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set itself has a weird design. The sides of the pilot's seat are open, and the ""wings"" seem sort of arbitrary. The design doesn't really protect the pilot, the character, from any danger. The minifigure is pretty cool though and I like the alien data tiles. Those look pretty cool. Aside from those tiles, the transparent pieces and the windscreen are ripe for using in a custom build. The wings could probably be used too, but I don't really like the logos on them.</div><div><br></div><div>This was a pretty easy build, it probably took me longer now as an adult than it did when I was a kid, but it was $6 back in '97 so it's a decent value.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you're looking to collect '90s space sets I would not recommend this one unless you're a real completist.</div>",TRUE,2,3,2,2,4
