"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T10:33:08Z","Totally sweet","Some would say I'm biased towards Futuron sets, and they would probably be right. This set was small but sleek looking and exciting. I used it to defend my Futuron monorail against the clutches of the evil Blacktron, but it wasn't strong enough to defend against a full Blacktron assault. Only the Space Police could....",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I got 4 or 5 of these in an ebay auction, and they are really neat.  What i did with three of mine is take off the droids, and seat a pilot in the back as well.  I set there weapons to the side right behind the folding wings, and then i made a folding peice that shivles to keep the passenger from falling on a corcscrew turn.  The ship has everything you can ask for.  Folding wings to increase speed, two droids, a cool pilot, nice compact cocpit, two lasers in the front, and a great selection of peices.  The only down would be that the fighter is only meant for atmosphereic flight. overall, this set deserves a 5/5 GET IT!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"eftichios1980","2008-11-13T04:29:15.09Z","My 2nd set and 1st Futuron","I liked emediatly the color scheme, like all the Futuron sets have. I can imagine very well the white out in space. Its a quite small set but for it's size it has some nice features and functions, like the moving wings you can put foward while landing. This gives another shape to the whole craft and in both positions it looks nice. The clue and the hidden heroes at this set are actuall the two engines which turn into robots, so the single Minifig is never alone in spca and I am sure its not easy to suprise him with his two bodyguards. Together with the &quot;Auxiliary Patroller&quot;(6850) it makes a really good patrol team. A must have of futuron sets.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-11-13T17:02:32.153Z","Now this is cool","I took one look at this ship and instantly fell in love with it. The canopy could be wider, but who cares? The set not only has folding wings, but it also includes two deployable robot drones that fit perfectly into the back of the ship, doubling as boosters. The weapons system looks fearsome too. The set might have been better with a black futuron member rather than yellow, but again, it really doesn't matter. The control panel is finely designed with a cool looking decorated button tile on it. The set is a great scout ship and is an amazing addition to any collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mi_ma","2009-03-06T06:31:02.763Z","My first space craft","This was my first lego set i've got from my parents whe i was 5. Robots was funny and bild from few pieces (not like now, that lego makes a lot of strange pieces and figures). Really good looking figter, with many details. I liek the movealbe wings, and a place for robots. When they are mounted to ship they looks like an engine. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"morelenmir","2014-04-23T12:55:29.94Z","My first Futuron and last Lego Space set","<p>I was bought this on Saturday the 8th of January 1988.</p>

<p>I had enjoyed Lego Space as a younger child, but for two or three years in the middle eighties I became obsessed with Transformers and my Lego took a back seat.&nbsp; During early December 1987 I had been getting back in to the Theme though, rebuilding or customizing old sets and then received - which back then seemed huge! - the Technic &#39;Car Chasis&#39; for Christmas itself and never looked back.&nbsp; I have bought Technic steadily ever since as both teenager and adult.&nbsp; This &#39;Space Patroller&#39; was the penultimate piece of space though.</p>

<p>The design and colour scheme had long moved on from what I thought of as &#39;real&#39; Lego Space - Light Grey/Blue and even starting to evolve beyond the later White/Blue.&nbsp; Since I had been away from Lego for so long the whole &#39;Futuron&#39;/&#39;Blacktron&#39; setting was totally lost on me and until I started cataloguing and restoring my old sets a few weeks ago I did not even realize there even WAS a Futuron!&nbsp; At the time it was the cool new helmets with visors that caught my attention and the large moulded translucent blue canopy.</p>

<p>Back then none of my kits stayed in their official configurations for long and this 6830 was no exception.&nbsp; However, while it did I recal liking it a lot - especially the swing-wing feature of atmospheric and deep-space flight.&nbsp; The backstory of the Futurons and their robots was lost on me and I&#39;m affraid the engines were only that to me then - although I must say I thought the arms strange!&nbsp; So far as complexity goes, I was starting to be tempered by Technic and this seemed rather simple in comparison.</p>

<p>Rather than get in to the official setting, I began to use my kits to recreate scenes from the 1930&#39;s Golden Age science fiction &#39;Lensman&#39; stories by E.E. Smith which I had just starting to read.&nbsp; Somehow this chap with his snazzy new-model helmet and half-white/yellow armour personified Grey Lensman Kimball Kinnison to me perfectly and Space Opera doesn&#39;t get any more epic than &#39;Doc&#39; Smith&#39;s books!&nbsp; There were a LOT of dastardly improvised (mainly from Lego City!) Boskone capital ships cut to pieces by coruscating Lego &#39;Primaries&#39; over those weeks I can tell you!</p>

<p>Eventually &#39;Space Patroller&#39; was cannibalized to form part of my huge vision for Kinnison&#39;s Super Dreadnought the &#39;Dauntless&#39;, which I literally only broke down a couple of weeks ago - 25+ years in a custom form must be some sort of record! Sadly she sat on a window ledge in full sunshine for most of that time and a quarter century of UV has not been kind to her Greys and Whites...&nbsp; Nevermind.</p>

<p>Oddly the very last Space kit I was ever given was the following Birthday - the &#39;Battrax&#39; Blacktron set.&nbsp; Strangely I never really played with that much and it too remained whole until recently, although safely hidden from sunlight under the bed.</p>
