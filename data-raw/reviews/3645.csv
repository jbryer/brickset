I love how the lasers fold down to harness the pilot.  The wheels are heavy and roll well.  It's literally an all terrain lego set and one of my favorite.  I greatly advise anyone who is reading this reveiw to give it a chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-17T00:39:17.187Z","STOP! umm SPACE POLICE!","I think this was the last set I bought before the years without light...I got it at a LEGO expo and it was really cheap. These little sets are always cool in my opinion,coz you can amass a horde of minifigs and little vehichles and platforms for not too much cash.
This set itself is a nugget of gold,you know he can do some serious damage to the Blacktron with those laser cannons!
Its got some handy pieces for conversion,I never had a Space Police ship so I cannibalised my old space sets and made a great ship OR moon rover using the space police sign. Well worth it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-26T22:48:40.623Z","Message Decoder","I know that it doesn't look like a message decoder, but this is a very good set. The wheels are rugged and runs smooth. The guns are pretty cool and ready to chase any space criminal. This is a must have for Space Police fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-08T13:27:05.7Z","nicely designed","As said by others, this really doesn't look like a message decoder, more like a strike buggy. However, it has brilliant wheels and i like the two gun looking things sticking out past him. I like the colar scheme of the vechicle, but the policeman's color scheme could use a bit of work, i prefer the darker colors of the new space police. Even though this doesn't come with a prisoner, that is reasonable because of its size, and the awesome design of the vechicle more then makes up for that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"nathanielsalmon","2010-12-05T01:43:31.537Z","Another fantastic small set","<p>Space Police I ""Message Decoder"" - More like ""Space Jeep with&nbsp;Cannons"" </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the Sets in this subtheme are fantastic, I recall the whole SP Vs Blacktron ""thing"" - Like the wild west in space!</p>
<p>I like the Colour Selection and the introduction of the Red Visor on the MiniFigs was pretty cool.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"AETerry","2010-11-10T01:34:13.043Z","Message Decoder?","<p>I loved the design, concept and colors of the first Space Police sets. Unfortunately due to budget and making a choice between Pirates and Space... I opted for Pirates and didn't get any more sets in this series beyond this one...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has some awesome little buggy wheel designs for a space vehicle. And the color designs for this set are just great. Though to me, this set looked more like a little strike vehicle then a Message Decoder. Ah well... still fun.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

Here is the Space Police one and it is actually rather good.</p><p><b style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; "">Minifigures:</b></p><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><ul><li>Trans red visor!</li></ul>The officer's 'cool as Pluto' super black and white uniform, is amazing with the red visor completing the high tech feel and distinguishing the cops from others.&nbsp;The new diagonally divided torso space suit prints were a bold design but I think the Space Police would have stood out much more if Futuron had not had quite so similar tops. It mattered not, their uniforms and blue, black and red ships with ace badges making them an instant hit and earning a fixed orbit in Space history.<div><br></div><div><b>Surface Rover</b></div><div>This was not called 'Message Decoder' in the UK catalogue. Where do these names come from, the original Danish translation or a US catalogue perhaps? The rider does not get much of a seat but the rough and ready ride makes room for his oxygen tanks while control levers steer this small beast run by the cosmic cops.</div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; ""><br></span>So its basically a moon buggy with the excellent tyres held by a one plate chassis and rig that features a nose cone with an imposing badge print and triangular nose plate. Twin laser cannons (really decent 'big guns') fold down from a hinge brick that connects in the back of double headlight bricks. Twin one stud circular offsets are used twice to hold the gun 'barrels' and the rear lights, right at the back on top of a slanting blue brick.<br>Plenty of blue and black makes the chunky but small build through the back section of hinge and slanted brick to the front ram style bumper. A suitably sci-fi design, still very in keeping with the 1970s and 1980s set ethos so pretty desirable. The other Space Police offerings were large and more elaborate but this added a neat ground force ride for a chief or captain and possibly fitted into that massive ship they got.<div><br></div><div><b>Space Madness</b></div><div>You can go a bit bonkers reviewing all these Space sets with their bleak stark black, white and grey starscapes devoid of flora and fauna. (Ok so writing in detail about a 1980's history of small toy based characters and describing how their place in a broader plastic construction brick collecting hobby merits praise and critique may seem intensely preoccupied. However with the focus on creativity, imagination, invention, development and childhood its justififcation seems warranted in the wider creative human firmament so its all cool really)&nbsp;...and we're back. A small but brilliant little effort that leads the ground forces nicely with the Space Police troops.

"James83","2012-07-21T11:30:43.277Z","Cop Chase - Moon Style","<p>This was one of the earliest Space sets I ever brought and the only original Space Police set I owned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>A moon buggy, the chassis is quite simple and easy to build. The balloon tyres are a nice touch and really look the part. The rear wheels are slightly higher, giving a nose-down attitude. The wheel arch bricks also add some charm and contrast nicely with the space-age nose. The cockpit has two sticks and the Policeman is quite comfy in there with ample room for his oxygen tanks. The rear of the vehicle is taken up with the hinge brick for the arms and the rear sloped brick with two movable red lights on top. I always thought that the two arms were some kind of laser weapon, but given the name of the set (not the same as in the UK catalogue) these must be some kind of radio antenna for covert evedropping on Blacktron communications. I think lasers are cooler however, that enables you to chase those Blacktron baddies around! Also, the twin arms make sure the driver doesn't fall out over rough ground. Overall the design is ok but its pretty basic and the wheelbase looks a little short.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>A Space Policeman, the suit is in the style of the Futron series but with white and black and hint of gold. White legs and white helmet with red visor complete the figure. The original Blacktron looked impressively evil in their all-black suits and visors, and the original Space Police also looked the part, the white giving a contrasting ""good guys"" look and the red visors adding a touch of sci-fi style.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>I quite liked this little buggy and had hours of fun with it chasing Blacktrons. It's quite sturdy, even with the twin arms and stands up well to rough punishment. If the arms too fall off its easy to re-attach them. This is a good old-school space set and offers a cheap introduction into the Space Police range and has enough playability to keep you satisified despite its basic construction.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,4
