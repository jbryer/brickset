It is the only set with the M logo on a window in M-tron.  Of the 3 small models I think this one is easily the best. One gripe, where are the magnets.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-04T15:40:03.357Z","My first Lego set ever!","I believe it was my fifth birthday, but I got this nifty little M:Tron vehicle as  my first ever lego set, and from then on life consisted of little else than these wonderful plastic bricks.  That note aside, it's a pretty typical small set, with a figure and a vehicle, but also enough special parts to make it useful for building alternate models.  It's got several neon green parts, including a windshield, which really make it nifty for kids.  I suppose it's nothing spectacular but then again I am biased because of my nostalgic attachment to this one :P",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2008-01-12T21:25:36.78Z","5/5 classic rover","   This is my favorite m-tron set next to the mega core, and i can't express how cool this set is.  I only own one that i bought with a copy of each other set in the m-tron series.  I love how there are so many transparent neon green peices.  The two printed parts in the set are outstanding as well.  This is the onlt space set with a logo printed on that type of windshield.  The black 45 degree 2 x 2 with the yello grills is also cool.  Overall, this set is an absolute must for any space colector.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2009-04-16T13:26:43.577Z","Somewhat out of proportion","The M:Tron theme has a nice variety in both vehicles and aircrafts (but alas, no real base) and this is the smallest of the former category. Just like in most other M:Tron sets, the colors of this set are great. Red, black and trans-neon-green make for a very pleasing, contrasty combination.

The buggy itself is cool, but not superb: I have a feel it is a bit out of proportion. To me it seems too high, compared to its width and depth. Nevertheless, you won't be dissapointed in adding this to your M:Tron collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-02-27T12:49:02.467Z","Rocket Boosters and big wheels","What more do you need in a rover, other than a magnet to go with the rest of the M-Tron line.   The wheels on this vehicle are probably the best feature, deviating from the generic Lego wheels, and coming up with something fun and space aged.

The wind screen was a nice touch that I thought some of the other small vehicles should have included as well. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>It's not a bad little set, minimal cover or protection for the driver, new print design for the computer console element. Oversized tires that look the part of a Space Bound planetary vehicles. There's not much to complain about with this set, M-Tron just wasn't the theme that really interested me.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,5

		<div id=""description_div5511025851"" class=""photo-desc insitu-trigger"">I
 remember I got this from a LEGO ® show in Hong Kong, most likely in 
1990. My mother let me pick a set within a certain price range as a 
souvenir of the visit. I can't remember why I picked this since I was 
never into space. Maybe I got a little excited over those transparent 
neon green parts. <br></div></div><br><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p id=""yui_3_3_0_1_1299702629268833"">The box is long gone now, but I have kept the instruction and catalogue (as a wish list) all these years.</p>
<h4><br></h4><h4>Parts</h4><p>The main attraction here is obviously the trans green neon parts. I was always careful with the very fragile looking neon antenna when looking for parts in my LEGO ® pails.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Other than that, the parts are not too versatile, you can't do much with them other than another space vehicle. <br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The only thing I absolutely love about this set is the colour contrast on the M:Tron inspector. He provides me the only black gloves I have.<br></p><br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>I can't remember what I felt when I first built it, but putting it together for the first time after some 20 years certainly brings such nostalgia! Looking for the parts amongst a decade worth of LEGO ® took much longer than the build, obviously. <br></p><p><br></p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This is a basic build with few parts but although at first glance it doesn&#39;t look much&nbsp;there are some neat touches. The jacked-up rear wheels really suit&nbsp;the overall design. The cone headlights look suitably futuristic and the balloon tyres are quite rare outside of Space sets. The canopy is a unique panel with a printed M-Tron logo which sadly didn&#39;t feature on any other set. It is hinged at the front and the cones attached the rear end serve as a handle to open it. The control panel is cleverly&nbsp;mounted on a hinge brick, which would have been nice to see on other designs. Behind the driver is a neon green printed vent sloped brick, presumably an engine vent and the rear features two green dishes and an antenna, which is a bit wobbly. However, the designers omitted any means&nbsp;to stow the hand-held radio.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard M-Tron&nbsp;figure with airtanks and a hand-held radio.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>Like most of my M-Tron&nbsp;sets, this had a long life in my collection. I added another clip brick on the back to carry the radio but there is little growth in the design to make serious changes. Overall its a neat vehicle but probably not really versatile enough unless you break it down and build something new.&nbsp;</p>
