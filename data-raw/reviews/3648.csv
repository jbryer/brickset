"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-17T00:00:00Z","","This is a neat little set, I'd definitely say you get what you pay for - especially since they're readily available for the same or less than they were on release. I actually got three or four of these, simply because I found that the blue 1x1 clip plates with Ice Planet sets were incredibly prone to breaking, even with only very light use... strange. Anyway, nice to see a model on skis, the detachable radar dish unit thing is neat, although I'm not sure about using it to store the skis - if the guy's going to place the unit somewhere and return to base he'll have nowhere to stow them on the journey home! This is probably the most severe case of ""Ice Planet open cockpit syndrome"" there is in the range, especially with the wind chill factor when you're zipping along at the speeds this nippy scout should reach. Also, as menitioned, the skis on the vehicle are fairly loosely attached and are prone to occasionally falling off, and I find the minifig skis can sometimes have too much of a tight fit and be too hard to remove. Still, great for what it is, definitely worth having a couple to scout out remote reaches of the Ice Planet Krysto.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-04T11:30:46Z","Another nice Ice Planet set","Although by itself it isn't much with every other Ice Planet set (my collection) it really fits in nicely. Its design is a bit ssimilar to the flyer set in that it can detach. The 4 large white skis are really nice to have. Overall I think this is my favourite small Ice planet set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-07-29T13:01:19.287Z","5/5 one of my all time favorites","awesome peices, awesome figure, awesome mini-base, awesome skiis.  this set has everything you could ask for ( with the exception of another figure).  i love the little detachable communications platform with the radar dish.  the dish is also orange which is just plain cool.  well, the set has four white skiis which are always cool to have.  the little orange anntenae is one of my favorite.  it's a great, easy, and cheap way to get the ice planet cheif.  so it's really cool and cheap.  a great addition to any collection.  don't pass up a chanse to own this little masterpeice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-06-12T10:48:57.81Z","The Best of Small LEGO Space Models","I have been trying to review this set for a long time but I have found it so hard to do. This is one of my top 10 models. It looks so much better in real life, pictures do it no justice.

The vehicle travels across the surface of the Ice Planet, Krysto, on four skis. This was some excellent thinking by LEGO and makes this model very individual. The vehicle is powered by a jet at the back of the model and is controlled by a control panel. These are two very spacey features that were included on this model but not over done.

The vehicle itself is quite simple, its just looks more complicated due to what it is carrying. The model is actually carrying a satellite relay station which is attached to the back. It is connected by a technic pin, which allows it to be taken out and dropped off somewhere on the far reaches of Krysto. By doing this you may think you loose the engine blaster at the back? Nope! It is also connected by a technic pin allowing it to be reattached to the model without the relay station. The only downfall here is that you loose a place to put the skis for the mini-fig.

The vehicle is also equipped with an aerial, meaning it dose not rely on the satellite for communications and the relay station can be tested on the way back to base. It is also equipped with a chainsaw cutting bar for all those issues you could run into.

The shape of the vehicle is very appealing and aesthetically pleasing. More so is the colour scheme. The blue with the white is just excellent to blend in with the planet and the black, neon orange extras really finish it off nicely.

The mini is dressed in black pants and top, with blue belt line, white sleeves, blue hands, gold on his top, white oxygen tank, neon orange visor on his white helmet and his face is older looking, with thick white eyebrows and mustache. 

Overall this is a top model with the only thing missing being a seat for the driver. The model has all printed parts, NO STICKERS, excellent colours and great aesthetics, making it a really top model. I feel this model is about an 8 or 9/10 as it really has allot of good things and has that WOW factor, which is hard to find in the smaller models. This is a truly classic model and screams out to every LEGO fan to love it. A must have for space fans and a great one for collectors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-10T19:54:00.467Z","skis!","I really like this set because it has a better selection of parts than the ice tunnelator. it comes with 2 orange skis, a control panel, an ice planet ramp, a saw, an orange disc, and my favorite, the four big skis. they are perfect for the new jack stone figures and are cool on any snow vehicle. the visor was also cool. it looks like the visor someone uses to weld some thing back into place. the vehicle does not look good with out the radar mini-base so i leave it on. if you need a bunch of ice planet parts for a cheap price get this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-10-26T19:25:00.903Z","Cool sled","This is a great ice planet set for an even greater price. The set has NO STICKERS and at the same time plenty of accessories and detailed parts. The minifigure is the ice planet chief and the bottom skis are those from technic figures. The back end with the radar also detaches (and the little booster also re-attaches to the main vehicle). The set includes a pair of skis and a saw (but there is now chainsaw body). Overall a great scout sled for any space or arctic collection. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCollector125","2011-06-02T17:28:54.877Z","Great Small Ice Planet Set","<p>Ice Planet is one of my favorite themes, and the main reason I got this set was to get the Chief. But, overall, it is a great small set from this theme. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box shows the sled against a nice blue ice background. The instructions make it easy to tell the differences between colors in the set. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set has a great selection of parts, including the various trans-orange pieces, the white skis, the selection of blue pieces, and the Ice Planet logo brick. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The one minifigure, the Ice Planet Chief, is amazing. He has a helmet with a detailed visor, various logos on his chest, and a white oxygen pack. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is really not anything special, as it is a small set, but overall is still fun. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished product looks like it could easily be found sliding across a snow covered plain on an alien world. The sled features various places to hold the Chief's gear, and also a detachable satellite to increase playability. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, really a great small set, one I highly recommend to any LEGO fan, or especially a Space collector. It has great figures, playability, and a nice finished set. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,4
"James83","2017-08-18T15:35:03.363Z","Commander Bear's Cool Sled","<p>In the UK brochure this set was known as Commander Bear and the minifigure&#39;s imposing face certainly implied a rugged leader and it was only fitting that he had such a special vehicle to use.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This cool sled is a two-part vehicle, similar in concept to set 6852&nbsp;Space Police Com-Sat 6, but much better in my opinion.&nbsp;The front section is the sleigh using four large Technic skis which are well attached, the middle skis having some extra support from two round stud bricks. The wing brick gives a suitably futuristic shape and provides a very roomy cockpit. It is decorated by a printed sloping brick,&nbsp;two vent bricks and a printed Ice Planet computer brick as a control panel. An arrow shows where to pull the two sections apart. Two clips hold Commander Bear&#39;s icesaw and a radio antenna.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The detachable rear section holds a detailed rocket engine, complete with orange disc &#39;flame&#39; and has neat hooks to stow the skis. On top of the rocket motor section is a neon orange&nbsp;radar antenna which tilts in elevation. The detailing of the pieces used here are&nbsp;really good with a mix of circular and bracket bricks. My only nitpick would be that the radar doesn&#39;t rotate, but at least it is sturdy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>An Ice Planet Chief figure with a different torso to the standard figure and a head with white eyebrows and mustache. He was a relatively rare figure. He comes equipped with an icesaw and skis (both neon orange).</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>Commander Bear got a lot of use out of his sled across the icy wastes of the bedroom carpet and the snowy sofa cushion mountains. This set is very well designed and looks good and the detailing on the rear section is nice to see. I think most of the Ice Planet sets were excellent and among the best Space theme vehicles ever designed&nbsp;and this set is certainly one of my favorites.&nbsp;</p>

"aredotam","2014-12-16T22:21:53.13Z","Excellent Smaller Set for the Tundra","<p>Celestial Sled is one of my favorite Ice Planet 2002 sets. It&rsquo;s small but has a lot to offer and a lot of potential for modification. Also, it&rsquo;s pretty tough for its size.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>Sturdiness: I have two Sleds, both of which survived many explosions, crashes, and repairs. They were stacked together in a box for 20 years and came out with just a few pieces popped off.</p>

<p>Potential: The best thing about this set is its ability to be transformed into something else, using only the pieces included. For instance, by turning a few pieces around I gave the Sled a more &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; profile, for added speed (or whatever else came to mind). I also think playing around with the orange satellite dish is fun.</p>

<p>Accessories: As with all Ice Planet sets the Celestial Sled has storage spots for skis and a saw. And similar to the Blizzard Baron, the Sled has a rear detachable satellite unit to establish comm relays, telescopes, and on and on.</p>

<p>Minifigure: The &ldquo;chief&rdquo; minifig is pretty cool with his white mustache and bushy eyebrows. His torso has some gold colored printing and what look like small rank bars that aren&rsquo;t present on many other Ice Planet minifigs.</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>No real complaints from me. Maybe a joystick could have been added . . . but the Sled has a pretty cool control panel.</p>

<p>The Celestial Sled is small but packs a lot. I&rsquo;d recommend it for all ages as a standalone set or, of course, as part of the Ice Planet 2002 collection. The Sled might even fit with the semi-new City Arctic series.</p>
