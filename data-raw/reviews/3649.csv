"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-01T06:02:42Z","Neat Little Spaceship","Spyrius definitely has to be the biggest departure from the usual wings-and-rockets style spaceships.

The good:
-Very well designed.
-A good source of red inverse slopes and jet engines.
-Weapon can be used by minifig
-No controls? No problem. Note the funky headband on the minifig's head. It suggests direct brain-control.

The bad:
-Is there any point to having the monitor outside the cockpit? itd be pretty hard to see from a reclining position.
-Not enough pieces, i could easily imagine this in a bag set or as part of a combination pack.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Aaronlego","2006-05-29T09:35:44Z","Cool little saucer","This was my first space set.It is so neat because of the four wing parts!I like how it has a small mounted laser cannon thing on the front.The only downside I could mabey say is that the little moniter/control panel is on the outside of the ship. But other then that, this little ship should get a 10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-29T11:54:39.123Z","Buy a bigger Spyrius set!","I wouldn't recommend buying this set. It's nothing special. It doesn't even have a computer or a screen in the cockpit. There isn't enough space, but there's a monitor outside. But maybe you'd like to buy it for its pieces. There are four black jet engines. By disassembling it you will also have four red wedges, which you could use to build two boats for medieval soldiers. 

However, buy a bigger Spyrius set if you have enough money. This one is not so interesting and nothing special. It's not worth the money. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2008-01-14T14:13:22.28Z","5/5 cool little set","   There isn't too much to say about this one because you can see pretty much everything in the picture.  I like how they used the saucer idea in this set and the saucer centurion.  This idea is juat cool and original.  The gun on top is cool and so is the spyyrius figure.  It's cheap and easy to get a hold of.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DVDWow","2008-06-05T09:14:48.34Z","A Good, Fun, Small, Cheap Set","What is there really to say about this little Spyrius set? I picked it up for about $5 shipped on eBay to help complete my Spyrius set. It's obviously really small, and really cheap.

The best part of this set is clearly the overall design. The set feels and looks like a UFO, and it really fits in quite nicely with the rest of the Spyrius sets. The one minifig is great, with an oxygen tank, and he kinda sits back oddly to fit in the cockpit, but you could see that given the design of the craft.

The build of the set is quick and easy, there's no really confusing or difficult parts.

There are quite a few pieces for this cheap set, a very good value set, and it makes sense why it was re-released a few times throughout the 90s.

Overall, my only real complaint about this set is the computer piece on the outside, which seems oddly out of place. Otherwise, this set is a great value set, but it doesn't have a whole lot to it.

"krysto2002","2008-07-20T16:32:28.577Z","Awesome scout, I've gotta get more of these!","This is an amazing scout ship, despite its size. The ship has a tight cockpit, plus an actual seat unlike most ships. The ship is not over armed and has just enough firepower to be a threat. The mechanism on top is either a scope, a camera, a laser or whatever else you choose. Though the panel out side seems like a computer, it also looks cool as a front cover, rather than having all four ends exactly the same, taking away from the design and the playability, since you can't build much else without the computer. Also, the computer can serve as a security system, allowing the pilot in, or as a dataport for the found (stolen) information. But what makes this a great scout is that the four dual boosters make this ship beyond agile, since the thrusters make for movement in all eight standard directions as well as allowing the ship to turn on less than a dime, since if two thrusters fire in opposite directions the ship rotates. All this agility makes this a troublesome ship to chase especially in the Space Police ships...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-27T18:07:08.343Z","i feel sick!-saucer scout captain","Well this is a nice little set, but the design makes it look like it would spin in circles.

Pros: Good little scout in general. The spyruis minifigs look good and have great color, as does spyrius in general, and this set has a rare blue dome.

Cons: Well the biggest con is that, with the design of this set, the ship would spin in circles and make the driver throw up. I also wish spyrius had some larger ships. Don't get me wrong, but their largest ship is quite small.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"highzed","2009-05-19T14:38:57.607Z","Simplicity and good design! This is high technology","This is an amazing set. I consider it my favourite space set because this small saucer has two important points developed in the Space-Futuristic Tecnologies;
simplicity and design.
The four elements give the simmetry of the cross,  suggesting high manovrability. Minifig in the cockpit is seats in a stretched position and high visibility gived by glass dome is a caratteristics of a futuristic space ship.
Cockpit has not any instruments (we should imagine HUD on glass dome!) but it is very easy to modify this set in an interesting way...
On both sides of minifig in the cockpit it is easy to add a slope brick 2x2 with some instrument or computer, in grey color like cockpit is (you have to take away the 1x1 brick before...)
Result is wonderfull!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
