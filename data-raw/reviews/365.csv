<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>If I recall correctly, I found this on a peg at either the local V&amp;S Variety shop, or Toys R Us one summer afternoon. &nbsp;My Mom quickly relented, as she usually did for Legos, and I had this pack in my hands. &nbsp;Two small sets (like the picture), packed onto a flat.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing overly shocking via the parts for this. &nbsp;The two hook, the cool flat windscreen for the tow truck, and a ton of clear lights.</p>

<p>As for the race car/go cart,&nbsp;it was a simple build off a odd chasis&nbsp;that gave the car it&#39;s leaning forward look.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Each vehicle came with their own minifig. &nbsp;Both rather generic. &nbsp;Typical overalls and ball cap for the tow truck driver, and a simple red zippered&nbsp;racing outfit with simple white helmut. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The tow truck is a fun build, as the color scheme is quite cool. &nbsp;The striping sets this tow truck apart, and it&#39;s utilitarian looks with the large white grill, flat windscreen, and multiple headlights, and warning lights are very cool. I love the additional fog lights added below the chasis, and the tail lights as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With the go cart, there&#39;s not much too it. &nbsp;Although the printed piece with the speedy &quot;V&quot; is a nice addition, to an otherwise pretty plain build. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As stated earlier, the tow truck is the prize in this carded set. &nbsp;The red, white and blue striping on the body is what caught my eye 20 years ago. &nbsp;It still does today. &nbsp;There&#39;s naturally good playability with the tow hook, and this was a natural addition to my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6375-2/Exxon-Gas-Station"">Exxon Gas Station</a>, due to the color scheme.</p>

<p>The go cart does it&#39;s job. &nbsp;It&#39;s a fun little racer that was added to our <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6381-1/Motor-Speedway"">Motor Speedway</a>, group of cars.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The tow truck is the winner in this set. &nbsp;It still is visually fun, and is busy hauling cars back and forth 20 years later in our Town. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The go cart is a simple, yet fun, little car that exudes speed. &nbsp;</p>
