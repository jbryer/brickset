"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T10:10:26Z","Good.... for a UFO set","I think Ice Planet and UFO were two of the space themes where Lego started to get too specialized and less interchangeable. This was my favorite UFO set I think but not an excellent or unique model all-in-all. The android was kool though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-26T21:08:53.777Z","Old But Fun","I remember getting this set a long time ago while visiting relatives out of state. While the pieces aren't too original, it does come with that really nifty red cyborg guy. He's great alone if your a minifig collector. 

No doubt about it, this set was fun to play with. It's light and durable enough to mess with. If it breaks, it's really easy to fix. Perfect for smaller kids. 

So overall, with it's ease, durability, and cool minifig, this set gets a 5/5. 

Another uber short review. :P",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2009-01-22T00:40:36.373Z","Classic stunt fighter!","For such a small set, the UFO V-Wing is very aerodynamic and well constructed. It's simple, but the shape is well realized, and it's extremely swooshable. It's got three thrusters (one main and two smaller attached to the wings) which is a dramatic improvement from some of the older Space fighters which had almost none at all. It's also got some serious firepower for a small ship, with three frontal cannons. The open-cockpit design is acceptable because the pilot is a robot... which, by the way, is very cool. I like the alien ""heart"" that seems to be powering the body. I think it could have used some kind of helmet, though. 

Overall I love this set, I remember playing with it as a child. Highly recommended! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-07T14:25:26.59Z","Space fighter","This have TWO wings, and these are useful to any ufo set. Don't like very wings, but like a &quot;V&quot; letter and it is cool to play. The minifigure is an alien without armor or helmet, but is red, very rare. The ship do not have cockpit, like some old ufo sets, but still cool. This name appears in the Star wars movies, but Lego aren't making a fake thing. This is from UFO sets, very classic, and i rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2010-02-18T22:33:05.373Z","Very nice sample of the theme","<p>This set is a great example of the ufo theme. It has the laser pieces and overall looks very high-tech. The droid is a great figure, very detailed up close and quite futuristic. It has two large laser shooters which looks nice and add to the&nbsp;sleekness of the set. My only problems with this set is you need other sets to increase the playablity, and the UFO theme in general needs enemies; they have the weapons and nothing to do with them.</p>

"LegoAficionado","2010-08-17T13:44:56.8Z","My very first lego set (at least that I can remember)","This was my very first lego set that I can at least remember of, and let me tell you, it was the best. I played with it so much, that in the end I think I deconstructed it at least 5 or so times, so that I could rebuild it and have fun all over again.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Though this is one of the smaller sets to the UFO subtheme of the Space theme, it is a great set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigs:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">There is only one minifig in this set and it is not really that special unless you never had a UFO Lego Set. For the size of the set I am okay with having one minifig and the figure fits quite nicely with the overall theme and design of the spacecraft. So in the end, I like the minifig. Plus you can get some pretty rare body pieces and a nice rare head piece.&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></div><div><b>The Build:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">The build is, how should I say it, simple yet intuitive. It is nice to see a wide assortment of pieces being used and to finally see how every piece adds to the final product is nice. There really is no piece that feels out of place on the set, and usually most lego sets feel like some piece is put in some place for no reason at all.&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Back when lego sets, like these did not have all of those cool curved pieces, you had pieces that were really jagged and you had to do the best you could to make the sets look really fluid in design. I like that time long ago, as of now, instead of a simple few pieces to build an arch or a curve, you now have one piece that can do all of that and still look cooler. This ship is jagged and when you think of UFO's you really don't imagine jagged spacecrafts, you think slick and shiny. This set has none of that, but what it does have is originality and some pretty awesome blasters and cool neon green jets and pieces. The wings are also very nice.&nbsp;</span></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><br></span></b></div><div><b>Overall:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is a great set, and was definitely worth the price. Not only is the design fun and simple, it is still complex in its own way (I know that does not make sense, but it really does look awesome).

"LegoCollector125","2011-06-02T17:47:03.867Z","V-Wing Invasion","<p>V-Wing fighter was my first UFO set, I was&nbsp;quite impressed by it. UFO is a great theme, and this is a very distinctive UFO set. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Great parts selection 
<li>Nice sized set for the price 
<li>UFO Droid</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>No cockpit </li></ul>
<p>Overall, a nice set, but I would really have liked to have had a cockpit on the fighter, maybe like the one in Radon Rover [6829]. Also, one of the UFO commanders would have been a nice touch, instead of the Red Droid. However, the set still has a nice playability factor, and the build, while no special techniques are used, is still fun. The box is actually really cool looking, too. It also has a great parts selection, and hey, its UFO, what's not to like?</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
