"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T15:13:35Z","Okay","This is the one and only Insectoids set that I owned. It definitely sitcks with its theme (as the vehicle is shaped like a bug), but I don't really seem to like the Insectoids all too much. They seem just too thrown together. This set is cool for the magnetic orb, the minifig, and the big beautiful blue wheels. It's also kind of fun to put those trans-green insect eyes over my own. It makes everything look weird. Altogether, I don't like the Insectoids, but if you do, I would highly recommend this set. I'll give it a 7/10... ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's legs too, looks like very of insects. The colors are awesome, various green pieces, including the minifigure's body, and weapons. It also include blue pieces, like the wheels. The magnetic piece and a cristal are insectoids features.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's designed to be an ant, and for the most part looks good, though most ants I see have 6 legs and no wheels. (Though mine might just have issues)It has a magnet for it's mouth, which is a cool feature for Insectoids, as these magnets attract the crystals which are exclusive to these sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vehicle is an interesting little model even if it is odd that it has wheels and legs. The build takes no time at all. The control area is not closed in very well though, this is a vehicle that wasn't designed for harsh environments that's for sure. It does however have two nifty bug eye pieces and the magnet on the front to pick up the Insectoid Orbs using the magnetized sticker. Those insect leg pieces are fairly rare too I haven't seen them outside of Insectoids personally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is menacing and cool, it comes with the shoulder armor introduced in the UFO Sub-Theme and an Insectoid Helmet. Overall I'd say this set is nice to look at and fun to play with, but it isn't a must have. However since it is so small and cheap and gives a nice looking Mini-Figure you may find an interest in it even though it does have a few odd design choices. Either way you look at it, it's a set I used to own and therefore by default is one from the Space Theme that I personally still want for my display someday.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
