In retrospect I can see its flaws. The hinges are simplistic, the upside-down radars are poor survey dishes and the manoeuvring thrusters make no sense. Also, where is he reading the results of his surveying? On the other hand, the aesthetic was great and the walkie talkie was handy. 

I suppose the big difference between then and now is the blocks themselves. With more generic parts (like the radars as survey dishes) you were encouraged to take these sets apart and make new ones. I love my son’s Mars Mission sets, but I don’t feel like making new spaceships from the pieces – and isn’t that the point of Lego?

It set has some strange items. The thrusters are indeed  a bit strange. The radars are attached to the vehicle in a not so sturdy way. The swoosh when you ride the car.

But is has generic bricks that can be reused in other sets. For a small space vehicle I think this set is OK. It has moving parts. It has some colours added to the space gray. It has a mini figure. You can drive it around, you can look for minerals. You can play with it . And it is a nice addition to your space / moon collection.

All together for me a 5.
