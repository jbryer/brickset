"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-18T10:19:50Z","SWOOSH","This was our speederbike, although at the time it did not excist (yet). For so small a design it had a big swoosh factor. Also the fig is totally superb. It brings you back to &quot;when live was easier&quot;. On the other hand, now I can buy whatever lego I want (as long as my money holds out). I even have a great excuse for buying lego (having a daughter shuts everybody up). Also this set was very easy to expand and combine with other small (or big) sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

You can get the minifig from  A to B. But that’s where the playability end. No extra’s to do anything with. I have two in my collection (got them as presents), and they’re OK to have. But I wouldn’t buy one myself.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-31T23:27:28.873Z","Boring Vehicle","I just got this today and after putting it together, I feel like its the most boring little Lego set I've ever seen.  It has a clunky design that is neither very sleek looking, nor unique.  It falls somewhere in between both and fails at both.  You can't even do much with the parts to make a more interesting set.  For it's size it still only fits one figure, so doesn't even work as a shuttlecraft transporting Spacemen from one base to another or whatever your imagination can think up.  Ugh.  Disappointment all around.  Only buy it if you're a completist.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

Very well powered!","<p>I still own this wonderful ship.&nbsp; It had nice&nbsp;massing that made it feel very comfortable in the hand.&nbsp; It was well powered with a rocket on the back and four on the bottom.&nbsp; I very much liked its simplicity.&nbsp; Unlike other medium size ships this one was very rugged and did not break easily when handled.</p>

"PeteM","2015-11-02T17:32:20.77Z","Not every Classic set is a classic set","<p>Even though it was issued in a slightly lean year for Classic Space sets, this oddly sized set still nestles awkwardly between the generally more effective designs found in the tiny scout ships and larger spaceships elsewhere across&nbsp;the range.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>While the box has long since gone from both my memory and reality, I do still have the instructions &ndash; a simple sheet of paper, printed double sided and folded a few times. The 11 steps are clear and easy to follow, set against a sandy planet surface background. There is an alternate model pictured at the end, and has the dubious distinction of being one of the few that is actually better than the retail model!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Though none of the parts are particularly remarkable from the vantage point of 2015, getting four of the little booster rocket-type parts with a 2x2 connection point on top was quite a treat at the time as I seem to remember they were quite new. In addition, the white 2x3 slope printed with the now-iconic Classic Space logo is always a nice addition to any collection. Other than that, there is a fairly small selection of white bricks and grey plates, including two differently-sized wedge elements.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In&nbsp;my opinion, a&nbsp;general rule of thumb for <em>all</em> sets should be: if you&rsquo;re only going to include one minifig, make it a classic spaceman (think how much better those small pocket&nbsp;money&nbsp;Town and Castle sets would have been!). Here you get a red variant of the many&ndash;hued iconic figure, complete with colour&nbsp;co-ordinated helmet and air tanks.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is basic and quick with few surprises. There is a &lsquo;quirky&rsquo; technique very much of its time, which involves inserting an antenna through a ring attached to a 1x1 plate. I understand that this is generally now frowned upon in modern sets as to get it in place requires some force and removing it even more, often resulting in a single 1x1 plate separated from the ring section, which then remains stuck on the antenna for all eternity (or 34 years and counting in my case&hellip;).</p>

<h3>The completed model and overall opinion</h3>

<p>The result is, as could be expected, small and basic. It seems to have quite a few good things thrown in to the mix, but none of them really work particularly well on the finished model &ndash; using two different kinds of wedge plates should give it an aerodynamic profile, but doesn&rsquo;t; the black loudspeaker pieces used as exhausts just look awkwardly jammed on the side; and the random positioning of antennae produces a visual jumble at the rear. Even the large round cone element mounted sideways on the back as a rocket just adds to the generally unbalanced feel. And on top of all of that, the whole thing is piloted using a steering wheel!</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a passable attempt, but not from the top, or even second, tier of Classic Space sets. It can&rsquo;t carry anything, pull anything, it&rsquo;s neither sleek and exciting, nor robust and functional &ndash; it even looks ungainly when hidden amongst other sets as part of a larger diorama. Credit to the designers for at least trying something a bit different and still producing a fairly &lsquo;swooshable&rsquo; model, but I remember the main value to me was that it was quickly broken up so I could use the parts for more exciting vehicles. Nowadays, with such parts easily sourced online, I can&rsquo;t imagine it would hold much interest outside of those who need to complete a collection.</p>
