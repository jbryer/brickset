- The vehicle is quite big compared to my other 'space classic verhicles'
- It has an articulation, you can learn driving backwards aswell 
- It has cool tyres

Plus the austronaut on the instruction looks very funny and different to many of my other sets (the other guys are all just sitting). He seems to be happy to get the sismobile and not the surface rover (6804):

Unfortunately my instruction has a small rip.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The lights in front of the vehicle are good but look alot like guns. Overall, this set is good from every part of it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Anyway, enough with the spelling lecture, its time for me to tell you all about this classic and largely overlooked set.
It's a jointed vehicle, which I always like in space sets, and it has those lovely big wheels that many space vehicles of that era had, but unfortunately are seldom seen nowadays. The whole structure is sturdily built, and I know from personal expenience that it is difficult to break however much it is thrown around.
The colour scheme is simple but looks very nice and fits in with the grey/ blue/ yellow/ white colour scheme of the majority of 80's space sets. It also has just enough features to keep it interesting, with the scientist having two pieces of detachable monitoring apparatus attached to the back of the buggy, two hi-beam headlights, a long- range radio antenna, and two safeboxes to store rock samples or whatever.
It really is hard to find fault with this set, it's durable, nice looking, has playability, has decent alternate models, and the pieces are useul. The one thing that I feel is missing is something for the astronaut to hold. Something like a radio or a wrench/ screwdriver or a video camera. That one piece of equipment would have really made this set for me, but even withut it, this is a typical example of 80's lego design, fusing simplicity with substance, and a set that classic space fans cannot afford to miss out on.
