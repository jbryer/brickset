The building was easy and unique for a small set, I liked the folding wings and the laser gun that you move up and down, but regarding to the hinges brick that holds the wings it got loose over time and weak, so the wings are keeping falling off, also the black speakers that are used as exhaust on the back also keeps on falling,&nbsp;these are the only cons I&nbsp;faced with this set&nbsp;. However, since some of the parts are either lost or as I said got weak, I have done a slightly transformation to this set, not changing the set but sort of upgrading the set.<br />

Still the set is great</p>
