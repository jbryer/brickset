The seat is part of a slide-out detachable craft which blew me away when I first figured it out back when I was 6.  The only thing keeping me from giving this set a perfect score is the numerous antennae and such are prone to fall off.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-08-17T17:40:14.623Z","Only one review","I can believe this set has only one review, it is the best medium ship of the classic space era, the ship is really good looking and it has a small ship that can detach from the main one in a very claver way.
I was proud of owning this set as a child.
Please more reviews to this sets, it deserve a better rate.

<br />
Bought this set in excellent condition on EBAY.&nbsp; I have fallen in love with the blue and white colors scheme.&nbsp; Came out of the dark ages recently and only had the blue/light gray and white/gray color schemes and wasn't to interested in the blue/white color scheme but after purchasing this set I have found a new appreciation for blue/white.<br />
<br />
Great playability!&nbsp; you can create you own family of mini-ships to attach to the main ship.&nbsp; Having a detachable ship always allows you to survive a severe attack from your enemies, This is a rare feature in this size class of ships.<br />
<br />
Good looks!&nbsp; blue/white looks great!!<br />
<br />
Good variety of parts!&nbsp; Not having a lot of sets with this colors scheme has made these parts valuable in building MOC's<br />

Hard to comment on price as I bought on EBAY!</p>",TRUE,3,5,5,5,4

There was a Lego catalogue which featured this and it's grey space fighter counterpart (the Space Dart?) flying towards camera on the front page. I remember it being in the sale bin of a toy shop in Stevenage, UK in
 what must've been around 1985. My Mum didn't share my enthusiasm for the set and I missed out. Not long after, I got the Space Dart and this was enough to keep me going and before I knew it, a new range of Lego Space was out and the Tri-Star Voyager became a misty eyed memory.<br>In my adult years this was the first set I bought used online. Back then, there would've been at least a 20 year gap between my childhood dependence on my parents for Lego and my adult ability to by whichever set I want. It was worth the 20 year wait. I love the spacecraft, it as sleek and spaceworthy as I had hoped. I never grow tired of seeing classic Lego astronauts (apart from the white ones, I had a surplus of those) and then the little features; the drop down wings at the back which also free the escape pod. The pod, another nifty feature which, as others have already mentioned, is not something you'd expect on this size toy. The experience of finally netting this set and the freedom of eBay pushed me into getting some of my old sets, missed opportunities or pieces I had lost through the years, including the Galaxy Commander set which I had desperately wanted as a child. So thumbs up for the push back into Classic Lego too.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-01-10T06:57:50.023Z","One of the best and most detailed Classic Space ships ","<p>So buying the new Lego Movie 2 Classic Space set (70841) really got me desiring some more Classic Space sets as the new set left a lot to be desired but gave me a lot of minifigures in need of better ships. I still have 10 Classic Space sets from my childhood (which I believe was my entire collection of space), and I just pieced together 8 more Classic Space sets off of Bricklink. I chose sets that I could get for a few dollars without the minifigures, this one was the largest and easily the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ship is built off of a single large plate with angled cuts on both sides. It&rsquo;s really quite amazing how much detail could get built off of a single plate. This is largely thanks to the fact that it uses 7 of those triangular wing bricks, beyond these the rest of the bricks are fairly standard and not unique to Classic Space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to Classic Space, no other set of this size features so much detail and complexity. Larger ships may feature more detail, but it is spread out across the whole model, whereas this is jam packed with detail.</p>

<p>The set also has a very cool feature in that the seat/cockpit is removable (slides over tiles) and can become a mini ship. On its own it&rsquo;s not nearly as visually appealing, but it still works. I had never seen a feature like this before in Classic Space, the larger ships can get broken up into front and back, but they are usually connected via technic pegs, and certainly no other ships of this size have removable parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go as far to say it is my one of my favorites, obviously it doesn&rsquo;t have the sentimental value that my childhood sets have, and the larger ships are still better and offer more play. But other sets I have that are comparable in size are all terrestrial vehicles, it is very nice to get a ship of this size. Given how cheap it is to part together on Bricklink, I highly recommend looking into putting together this set, especially if you are going to be ordering some parts anyways.&nbsp;</p>
