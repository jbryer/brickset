It has a VERY wide axle.  It is wider than many of the older vintage sets are long.  Which makes it very sturdy and look exactly like it's a moonbase excavator.  It has TWO computers and some cool tubes on the side, as well as useful tools like a spanner and pickax.  Mine was missing the two red trans rockets on the back, but I hardly miss them because now it looks more utilatarian.  It even comes with four yellow 1X1 flats as 'alien rocks' to scoop up.   Despite it's low brick count, this is a fun little set. I enjoy it quite a bit.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set was no exception, though more of my enjoyment came out of taking the elements and using them in other MOCs. Still, this is a good set, you get a Classic Yellow Space Minifigure and a few accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was fairly simple though very ulitarian at the same time. Large oversized tires to suggest a Space Vehicle. yellow 1x1 plate elements to use as ore samples that the minifigure is collection, computer consoles, ""bazooka"" radar type mount for either scanning or protection. There's a lot of fond memories tied up with these Classic Space sets.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
