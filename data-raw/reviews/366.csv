There were many hours on the floor playing with these two sets that convinced my folks that this would not be a phase and launched my career into the LEGO System of sets beyond the Fabuland bricks.
</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>Both sets of instructions for this Two-Pack set are on folded sheets of paper, either side with LEGO's clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.</p><p></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 96 pieces in all in this set, mainly blue pieces. <br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get 3 minifigures in total - Classic Space Black, Red &amp; Yellow. 2 jet pack accessories and 2 vehicles. </p>
<h4>The build and completed models</h4><p>There are of course two sets in this pack - <br></p><p>1557 Space Scooter - I'll note that I long ago lost the instructions for set 1557 Space 
Scooter and until the advent of the Internet, I relied solely on my own 
memory for rebuilding it as it is that simple of a build.</p><p>1558 Lunar Rover - This set is fairly easy to build too and was always enjoyable for me. It's still fairly simple and it acts as something of a small mobile base for the two minifigures in it to operate from as they explore an alien planet.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div class=""description"">This is a good package set. I always and still feel it was a good bargain, getting two sets to play with and small assortment of minifigures and pieces to work with.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
