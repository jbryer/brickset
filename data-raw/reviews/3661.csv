"dim","2006-03-28T09:34:27Z","small is beautiful","This had a quite sleek look for such a small set thanks to the nicely put together canopy. Foldable wings were also a nice addition and the one-seater looked great with the wings both extended (which made for an aggressive bow-like plan view) and folded under the dome.
It was the last set I bought as a child and proved to be a favorite. Shame I lost it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2009-05-22T13:28:06.67Z","Well designed","For a mini-fighter with no accessories, this futuron set is a gem, making up for its flaws with a well designed ship with plenty of features.

The ship actually appears well armed, contrary to other sets.

Pros:
- Sturdy windshield
- The bar in he cockpit makes for a cool air tank-holder
- Great detailed parts and handy windows which are great for base construction.
- Well armed
- Cool fold out wings
- Great color scheme
- Cockpit lock

Cons:
- Futuron figures still feature gold that rubs of with wear.
- The levers don't go anywhere when folded up. (Note: this can be fixed by putting the levers on the opposite sides, so that the pilot can actually use them)
- Open cockpit (if you're one of the people who care)
- You need to open the cockpit to move the wings in or out.
- No form of propulsion (unless you have an imagination)
- No accessories

Overall, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, making this an excellent  set for any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"T79","2014-08-05T09:44:50.083Z","A VW Beetle... IN SPACE!","<p>At least, that&#39;s the vibe I get with this set: a complete, compact&nbsp;spaceship for little money. It cannot hold a candle to the classic&nbsp;#6932 Stardefender-200 but it&#39;s playing in an entirely different class, it would be like comparing the VW Beetle&nbsp;with a&nbsp;Porsche 911. And when seen as the Beetle, it&#39;s not too bad although it has some issues.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As is standard for these small sets, a folding sheet. This time&nbsp;with&nbsp;10 steps to complete the set. A child could do it (and in fact, did).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Probably the highlight of the set: one rather unique white 3 x 2 x 6 panel with printed grille and two trans-blue 3 x 3 x 6 convex panels, a couple more of these sets and you could build a space station! Two of those 1 x 1 bricks with a stud on&nbsp;the four&nbsp;sides which were still rather new back then and finally lots of hinges and wings. I would have liked more trans-red pieces though, you could never have too many of those.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One yellow Futuron astronaut, which are basically just an update of the classic spacemen: two-tone uniform and modern helmet with visor but still the same (brilliant) logo. He comes without any accessory but since you usually don&#39;t see him anyway that doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, very easy. The only problem for young children is properly&nbsp;aligning the swing-wings during construction.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The smallest set we had with an almost fully enclosed cockpit, unfortunately the legs of the astronaut&nbsp;are not protected but from the right angle (like the one shown&nbsp;on the box ;-) it looks completely closed. It still is a huge improvement over the previous generation of small ships without any protection at all. Also, no steering wheel in this set but a printed control panel. On the other hand, there is no visible propulsion system and the cockpit is prone to detach entirely when you try to open it. The biggest flaw is that those swing-wings cannot change position when the cockpit is closed: you have to open the cockpit to arm the weapons! #6886 Galactic Peace Keeper did a lot better in this regard but did have a piece count three times that of this set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>On its own, there isn&#39;t a whole lot you can do with this but swoosh it around (at least most other small spaceships had some sort of tool for the astronaut to do something when getting out of his craft) and it&#39;s annoying the wings can&#39;t fold in or out without opening the cockpit. So I would have given a &#39;three&#39; but since you get so many useful parts out of such a small set&nbsp;I went with &#39;four&#39; in the end.</p>
