There is also a space police officer with a lasr blaster. It's not supposed to be a megaphone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

If you’re an intergalactic criminal and you think that your lines of communication are secure, think again, because here comes Space Police’s Sonar Security, proving that the sky is far from being the limit as far as intrusive surveillance goes. I can only assume that Sonar Security roams around on the surface of the planet, listening in on civilians going about their daily lives until <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">BAM</span>, this lone Space Police operative finds a guy talking about harbouring a secret desire to rip the tag off of his mattress.<br><br>To be honest, though, I never really associated this vehicle with surveillance when I was a kid (which was when I had this set). The vehicle comprises of two parts: the six-wheel all-terrain-looking front part that houses our brave Space Police officer, and a trailer-type-thing that connects to the front with one of those socket joints. This gives the whole vehicle a much more fluid feel when it is on the move, the downside being that the trailer at the back does not stand up on its own when detached.<br><br>The front of the vehicle is functional enough, although space purists will undoubtedly criticise the very obvious fact that our poor police officer is HIGHLY exposed to the cosmic elements, with his cool transparent dark green windshield protecting him from little more than space bugs flying into his face. A SNOT bracket behind the driver’s compartment holds a white loudhailer accessory, presumably for shouting at the bad guys. It’s a standard Space accessory, alright, but come on - no weapons? What’s a Space Policeman supposed to do without any weapons?<br><br>That’s where the trailer comes in, you see, because sitting on top of this trailer is a detachable, missile-shaped object that I really think has nothing to do whatsoever with sonar security. It’s a NUKE is what it is, and I’ll be darned if I don’t get to use it as such! Yes, when interstellar security has gotten you down, just nip the problem at its source by nuking everyone. Trust me, it’s much more efficient that way.<br><br>Jokes aside, Sonar Security is a nice, one-person vehicle that’s a lot of fun. It doesn’t look terribly pretty, but it works. If you’re looking to beef up your galactic police force, get some guys on the ground and pick up this set. <br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"James83","2017-08-17T14:53:29.75Z","Satellite Tractor ","<p>Most ground vehicles in the Space theme around this time were either massive landcrawlers or tiny buggies so it was nice to see something in-between in size.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This six-wheeled vehicle was styled like the Space Police spaceships with a similar wing-shaped nose section and an opening dark green windscreen. The six wheels attach easily via Technic pins. The vehicle features rocket/jet engine bricks and a handy clip to stow the hand-held loudspeaker and a radio antenna. The driver has a standard steering wheel.&nbsp;At the back of the cockpit is a cylinder that might be a petrol tank or another rocket booster. This two-part vehicle includes a two-wheel trailer which carries a small satellite. The one flaw with the trailer is that it can&#39;t stand upright when detached from the vehicle. Also when driving over rough terrain (like sofa cushions) the trailer can topple over. The satellite looks good but the swiveling antenna dish arms are fragile and can be easily knocked off.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Space Police 2 minifigure with a printed head brick featuring a radio headset and brown eyebrows and come equipped with airtanks and a loudspeaker (ray gun?).</p>

<p><b>Personal Developments</b></p>

<p>This is a good looking vehicle, its no Blacktron chasing buggy, but it is a workhorse vehicle doing a job (transporting and launching spy satellites) so make a nice change from police chases. My only bugbear with this set are all the wheels, unless you use them on an eight-wheeled creation you have too many.&nbsp;</p>
