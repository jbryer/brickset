"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T13:31:01Z","Great Rover","This set is a great rover set and packs a big punch for a little set. It is a nice addition to your Explorien Collection and the magnetic crane is what makes this set awesome. Two thumbs up! Although, I will have to say I am much more fond of older space themes and don't think the colors, or minifigs, etc. of the explorien theme are too unique. It's the elements that make sets great.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I'm not much of a fan of vehicles that can't support its front or back, but this one counters that effect with the smooth-bottomed booster in the front. The hose linking the pilot to the ship is very unique and adds a great touch plus, for a small set, this one also includes a magnet, being the smallest SET to have one (score)! The set also includes all needed accessories: a scanner and a magnetic tile (exclusive to the series). The set also includes two decorated slopes and a round tile with the holographic star pattern (also exclusive to the series). The set tops off with plenty of hinges and a set of four space wheel (love them or loathe them...). One of the coolest features is that, when exposed to one of the two colored 4x4 dishes, the tile appears different. Overall a great set with plenty of cool parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"William_the_Conqueror","2011-02-20T20:42:32.31Z","Nice ""Under $10"" Set","This isn't a bad little set at all. Back in the '80s and '90s, it seems like ""smaller"" sets that had around 100 pieces and were fewer than $10 were a lot more common. This set falls into that category.<br><br>For under $10, you could get an Exploriens Minifigure, a printed Exploriens slope piece, a printed slope piece for the control panel, transparent red and blue radar dishes, 4 black space wheels, the white ""space gun/ray"" piece, the white engine piece, the white hose piece, and black and white hinge pieces, not to mention the magnet pieces, which LEGO no longer produces.<br><br>The set's design isn't all that great, but the magnets, turntable, and fingered hinge plates (which haven't appeared in sets since 2006) are great features that give the set ""playability.""<br><br>I'm still not sure what purpose the white hose piece serves, or why the box art and set instructions attach it to the astronaut's helmet, but it's a cool piece to have.<br><br>All in all, this feels like an Exploriens parts pack. It has most of the pieces and features that distinguished Exploriens from other Space themes, most notably the magnet function, and the vehicle itself is sturdy. It would have been nice if the astronaut had room to sit down on the vehicle, but for a set of this price and type, it's hard to complain.<br><br>Final Word:<br>If you're a Space fan who likes Exploriens and you can find this set cheap, I'd recommend picking it up for the part selection.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-18T12:57:32.68Z","LEGO Space (Exploriens) - Alien Fossilizer Review","This set is a small set but it's a cool little set to have around. I like the minifig which comes with this set and we also get a few stickers which you have to put on. You also get a magnet which is attached to an arm which does sviwel and the two stickers can be picked up with the magnet piece as well. The arm also has a laser gun. The built is very easy and this set is very sturdy too. If you put the plates with the stickers under the translucent red and translucent blue piece you can see that the picture of that stickers will change. I think it's a cool little set with a nice play feature - even if this model doesn't have many play features...<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Alien Fossilizer is a model that uses some fairly standard pieces and a few not so standarad ones. It rolls on four large black tires&nbsp;and has a crane arm with a magnet brick attached to it for picking up the fossils (just ordinary plates with magnetized stickers on them.), it also has a small laser weapon for the Mini-Figure, at least I assume it is, and two large transparent circular pieces. I think they were for sensing the fossils that the Exploriens were searching for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is a nice looking figure from the Explorien line, he comes with a helmet and oxygen tanks, plus the vehicle includes what appears to be an air hose that attaches to his helmet. I was never quite sure what to make of that really, is the Alien Fossilizer capable of resupplying his tanks with oxygen or does he need it in order to breathe on the strange alien world that the Exploriens have discovered? Either way it is an interesting method of interaction between the vehicle and the Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set to Space enthusiasts who enjoy the strange looking vehicles that LEGO Space of the late '80s and early '90s offered up. And as far as Explorien sets are concerned I don't think this is a bad set, although once again you are getting an open air land based vehicle. Some of these could be improved a little with some cockpit/driver's area covers, I think MOCers might like trying to build different vehicles using the parts included with this set. I once attempted to combine this set with the Hovertron, but it didn't go so well.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
