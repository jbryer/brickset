The only fighter escort cool enough to be the permanent wing-man for my Galaxy Explorer, this powerhouse was always  in the thick of any fight. I remember it well, and I am glad I still have it and many other Classic Space sets today to remind me of the many hours of imagination I used to put into them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is rather easy to build and quite rugged, and its fighter jet-like appearance worked very well for the sci-fi craze of its era. I scored an immaculate example on an eBay auction in mid-2012 as I tried to build my Space Classic collection (which includes the one Space Classic set I had in childhood - 483, Alpha-1 Rocket Base).</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I actually received this set complete with its box. The box is fairly compact, and has the set design on the front and alternate build ideas on the back, typical of Lego sets of the early 1980s. One clue that this set is from a different era: there is no bar code, and instead there is a blank space where the retailer could write in a price.</p><p>The instructions are easy to follow, on a folding sheet. My immaculate set even came with a second sheet that was Lego's mini-catalog for 1981 or so, with a good overview of all the key sets in the three Legoland lines (Castle, Town, and of course Space) offered at the time plus a few other lines like Scala.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Typical early Classic Space - lots of gray parts, with strategic use of angled and sloped parts for a look not too different from Star Wars spaceships. All parts are quite standard.</p><p>In particular, four sloped large tiles are used to form the wings and the front fuselage of this vehicle, and four 2x2 cylinder bricks are used as the landing gear.</p><p>As usual, a steering wheel piece is used as the control column.</p><p>One unusual, and nice-looking, touch is a 1x2 transparent green brick as the windshield.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One red astronaut minifigure comes with this set. For pretty much all Space Classic sets before 1982, the red astronaut was the default driver/pilot, so this is par.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>More or less pretty straightforward, once the wing shape is formed. The interesting builds are the two gigantic engine-gun assemblies, which flank either side of the astronaut.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Even though the fighter jet look is impractical and useless on the airless lunar surface, this set looks just very cool. The look definitely is very science fiction appropriate, and thanks to the oversized engine-gun assemblies, the vehicle definitely looks very high-performance, ready to perform just about any kind of mission the player can think of.</p><p>The parts and the assembly are all fairly robust, so this set can definitely take on the abuse if needed to perform those missions. Fortunately, my example has virtually no play wear, and appears to have come from a grownup's static display collection, so it is immaculate, complete with intact, unfaded Space Classic logos on the cockpit sloped piece and the astronaut minifigure torso; I am a single adult as well, so this set will remain strictly a display piece and continue looking good for years to come next to other Classic Space sets.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>One reason why Classic Space is so charming is because it used rather simple, standard parts to portray futuristic space vehicles and bases. The X-1 Patrol Craft sticks to that formula, and comes up with a robust, cool-looking vehicle that is fun to play with, or even just to look at. This set could even be an inspiration (or even a parts source) for a custom build project that stays faithful to the essence of Lego play - using everyday parts to make imaginative projects.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
