A great set.
Worth buying the three sets again to make it.

Onto the fun review part:
Secret Space Voyager

Crew: Three seems just right.  Two in cockpit and one ready to deploy.
For Movement systems: The SSV has two of the black rockets, and 4 smaller rockets about its frame.  Sadly, I would believe this would make the SSV slower than the Particle Ionzier. 

Maneuverbility: The SSV has at least 6 different thruster looking engines.  The SSV is very nimble.  Three Vertical fins, and two sets of wings plus two in the front probably means the SSV was made for atmosphereic flying as well as space.

Armor: The SSV looks beefy, and would most doubtly be able to take a beating considering how slow it may be.
Weapons: Plenty.  I can count at least 7 energy weapons and one launcher on the top.
Firecontrol, sensors, communication: There is one Mtron computer tile and I added another inside for extra.

The Little Lander is very cool.  I added clips on the back with tools, and either the little lamps in the front are weapons or lights, haven't decided.
This super set in my opinion beats the superset for Blacktron II.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
