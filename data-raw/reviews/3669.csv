But I never understood the &quot;loudspeakers&quot; in space or who's receiving the info send back to the wagon as there is just one fig. I think it's too bad no one is reviewing the smaller sets. The smaller sets were all I had growing up. And looking back they made me do what lego is ment for. Use this one and others along with the regular lego to build big spaceships.
And stop giving everything a 10, that's not helping the rating.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T01:11:17Z","more than one minifig short of classic","In response to the previous review, i would like to say that:

Those are not loudspeakers, they are supposed to be manouvering thrusters, as seen on early spacecraft such as the lunar lander. I'm not sure why the ground vehicle would have them. perhaps they are sensors or some other form of equipment.

On to the review

The good:
-Good ol' classic space charm
-Useful space elements

The bad:
-too MUCH Good ol' classic space charm ........very very basic design that more or less looks like some parts together. But that's to be expected from the first space sets. typical of early small classic space vehicles
-NEEDS another minifig

Conclusion:

Try not to go out of your way to get this one... save up for something more substantial like a 6930 Space supply station or something more quaint like an 886 space buggy",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-19T01:19:51Z","My first ever set!","Maybe this set explains why I'm such a huge space lego fan, as it was my first ever lego set.  

It's a great set, although I agree with the other reviewers in that it really needed another minifig.  I really liked the small craft itself...it was pretty simple, and just looked extremely nice.  Although why spacecraft had steering wheels in these early sets kind of puzzles me.

The launcher does the job.  A nice articulated body so you can steer it and the actual launch ramp is hinged so you can lower it or elevate it for launch.

There really is nothing wrong with this set.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-14T19:16:45.287Z","Nice little set","I was given this for Christmas in the early eighties so it holds special memories for me.  A nice, well-designed model with plenty of useful pieces.  Alright, so it needs another astronaut to look operate the launcher, but that doesn't detract from the set.

"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-17T22:18:56.25Z","Design FAIL","Ha ha! So the guy drives this thing out in the middle of nowhere, then climbs up in the Probe and launches.  So the ground delivery vehicle just gets abandoned? FAIL!

I just picked this up today, and I have to say, I'm much more impressed with it's successor, the Star Patrol Launcher (6871).  Both the spacecraft and the ground vehicle are very rudimentary designs with not much going on aesthetically.  The spacecraft actually looks like something I, as an unimaginative six year old, would build out of spare parts.  I would have to say don't drop too much on this set and either pick up the 6871 instead which is the same principal design (small craft on a small mobile launcher) or save up a little extra and get a larger set for more play value.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blitzr","2009-11-14T23:04:04.31Z","To be young","I know this was the third ever Lego set that I got...for the life of me, I have no idea who gave it to me and for what reason.

What I do remember is spending hours playing around with it.

Sure, the flex joint in the middle made scooting it across the floor a bit of a challenge. The little space ship on the back was my main point of focus. I reckon I spent days zooming around my back yard with this before I remembered that I also had two others that could join in the fun.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
