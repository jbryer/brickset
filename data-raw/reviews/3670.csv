"sabpol","2007-12-14T21:55:57.327Z","Cute!","This set is like having 2 in one - a little blue flying patrol and an all-terrain moon vehicle.  The back of the flyer sits on a hinge piece, so you just tilt back the flyer, and it's ready for take-off.  A rotating plate connects the front part of the vehicle to the back, so it is easy to maneuver.  And the set comes with 2 spacemen.  Cute set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-17T22:33:11.857Z","A Big Improvement","I bought this today at the same time as its predecessor, the Space Probe Launcher (6870) and this show remarked improvement.  First off, it has TWO Minifigs, one to drive, one crazy enough to get slingshot into space.  I like the aesthetic design of the two vehicles complimenting each other with similar nosepieces. There's a little computer to monitor the launch or track things or whatever, which adds to the play factor given enough imagination.

The only reason I didn't rate it higher is I'm not super impressed with the launch mechanism. I've seen better designs on other sets (including the 6870) And it's a smaller set with limited playability due to the number of bricks it has.  I see these smaller sets as companion pieces to larger playsets like moonbases and such. 

A fun, decent little set.  Good, but not great.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
