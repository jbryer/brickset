I already had a lot of Space sets at this time and this was a great addition to them, it was very welcome to join my collection...

With a narrow front towing a wide landing platform and scout ship, it was certainly a strikingly different look&nbsp;for such a small set.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are a simple fold out sheet detailing the 17 steps required to complete both vehicles&nbsp;included in the set. Set against a yellowy sand dune background, they are clear and straightforward.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts selection for such a small set is pretty good &ndash; with a number of the pieces I most associate with &lsquo;Space&rsquo; present and correct, including &lsquo;moon&rsquo; balloon tyres, spaceship seat (bracket), a round stand/support and the small 1x1 with fins. The blue and silver printed &lsquo;Space Nose&rsquo; was introduced in a few sets in this year, but then never appeared again, making it a strange graphic design cul-de-sac&hellip;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two minifigs, both in the mould (quite literally) of the original classic spaceman. One red, one yellow, there is nothing remarkable about them besides their deserving pop culture appeal. They both have their colour-coordinated oxygen tanks and space helmets and, though visors were still a year away, they looked as jolly as ever with the classic smiley face.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As could be expected with only 63 pieces, the build is a rapid process, but the pace at which the instructions proceed ensure it&rsquo;s not boring. The shuttle is complete in six steps and is&nbsp;based almost entirely around fixing a few bits onto a white spaceship seat/bracket. The rover itself uses a large hinge at its core, with the length of the vehicle extended with the strange nose section at the front and plates at the back.</p>

<p>A raised platform is constructed using a stand and some novel (for the time) sideways building, with two blue fence pieces being mounted horizontally on a plate to create a small landing pad. Two cones are then inserted upside down into the fences to create a more secure stand for docking the shuttle.</p>

<p>There is liberal use of white pieces for a bit of early greebling (a hose, some loud hailers as boosters or exhausts and various other protrusions), and then some trans yellow and red dishes to finish the model off.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>With the main body of the rover being only two studs in width, but 16 studs (+ hinge) in length, and with slopes and a wide platform bulking out the rear (and providing a tenuous link for the review title), it has an unbalanced sinewy appearance which I love &ndash; like it is genuinely designed for a landscape very different to anything on Earth.</p>

<p>The small shuttle is a wonderful lesson in economy &ndash; a perfect (if basic) little scout ship is created from only a handful of white and black pieces. It dovetails perfectly with the rover, though the upturned cones jammed in the fence pieces don&rsquo;t keep it stable over anything rougher than a medium pile carpet!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With its strong blue and white colour scheme, this set is a definitive and&nbsp;deliberate move away from the use of grey and trans yellow with which Classic Space is most associated and more towards the colour scheme used by the yet-to-appear Futuron sets. But while the colour scheme clearly points towards the future of the Space theme, the inclusion of the classic space minifigs gives the set a charm that the subsequent updated &lsquo;zip-up&rsquo; Futuron figures lacked.</p>

<p>If I was scraping around for faults I would say that, despite the balloon tyres, the vehicle wheelbase is too long and has too much of a wide&nbsp;overhang at the back to cope with any particularly rough lunar terrain, but that doesn&rsquo;t impede play in any way &ndash; in fact for any child who likes their scenarios to involve crashes and the like, it only helps!</p>

<p>The set sits well with rest of the &lsquo;ground fleet&rsquo; of vehicles available at the time, and alongside the subsequent Space sub-themes which came along. It&rsquo;s equally fun just by itself, as the inclusion of the detachable scout ship widens the scope of the set and provides plenty of opportunity for multiple play scenarios in a way that other ground-based sets can&rsquo;t match. Quite simply, a classic of the range</p>
