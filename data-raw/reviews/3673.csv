Space was the way to go!</p><p>This set is pretty sweet overall. Great ""swooshability"" and removable side things (we'll call them satellites) and a canopy that locks into place.</p><p>I remember hours of playing with this set, wrecking it (for it is fairly fragile) and rebuilding it.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Plenty of moving parts<br></li><li>Detachable satellites on sides, which can link together</li><li>Few if any ""proprietary"" pieces, of course this is true with most classic sets<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Relatively fragile, weak links on the canopy, would disassemble itself quite easily<br></li><li>Could have been bigger, but it was perfect when I was only 5<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>Now that I'm back to building with Lego again I think I'll revive all these old sets in my collection that have been dormant for 20 years.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
