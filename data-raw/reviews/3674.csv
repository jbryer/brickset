What I hate about this set is it's a little flimsy and has no indoor hatch, so it's not as good as an Alien Moon Stalker set.  It's still good for it's size though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-09T02:33:42Z","Blacktron 1 Memory","When I think about Blacktron 1 the Alienator is one of two sets that come up in my mind. I loved this set as a kid along with the Blacktron 1 Invader. What you can't see in this picture is the hidden compartment inside the body of the Alienator. The body would flip back, and inside you would find a wrench and a hammer (i think) that the pilot could use to either mend his Alienator, or club Futurons in the head with. Great!

The only bad thing I can remember about the Alienator was the way it walked. The legs where always sliding against the surface and would gather alot of dust from my mom's floor on the front of them. :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bonz","2006-03-23T21:27:33Z","Great set!","I really like the design of the colors (black/yellow) and how it looks like a AT-AT walker from Star Wars.
Another thing: the cockpit with the canopy can be seperated from the body with the feet.
I also remember that it is possible to put the whole mini figure into the hidden compartment in the back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-04-06T13:52:19.403Z","You'll never walk alone.","Lego's 'walking machines' are usually good, and this one is a classic amongst smaller space sets.  With its well-thought-out design, its legs can be moved in a 'walking' motion.  Other features include a cockpit which detaches to form a spacecraft and a back which lifts up to reveal tools.  With its dramatic Blacktron colour scheme, it looks great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zzoreil","2006-11-16T07:38:27Z","My first Blacktron Set","The Blacktrons are really a nice serie of the lego and this one was my first of them (and my only Blacktron set when i was a child). Now i got the other sets but this one still have a particular place for me.
Overall, he looks good, has a cool fig and i love this kind of walker like 6940,6882 or 6878.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-05-07T14:03:58.967Z","A classic.","The Alienator is the smallest Blacktron set, and it is a very nice one.

The legs of the vehicle can slide back and forth to simulate walking. The mechanism works pretty well and has been imitated in several Space sets (And in other sets) since.

In the back of the vehicle is a small compartment made up of two corner walls usually seen in Castle sets. The compartment opens to reveal two tools: A yellow laser gun, and a yellow wrench. Both of these elements are hard to find in yellow.

The figure included is a Blacktron figure like any other, completely suited in black. The design on the torso is one of the nicer minifig torso designs I've seen.

This is a real classic among Space sets. No Space collector should pass this set up!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-08T14:39:02.187Z","Small, yet still the blacktron feel","This set was one of the smaller ones out the orginal blacktrons, yet it still has the intimidating blacktron feel. The black minifigures are designed very nicely and look very futuristic. i like how this one looks like a hovercraft designed to travel small distances. Buy if you find it online!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-31T05:36:01.28Z","Alienated","With dwindling pocket money through an expansion of 'wants' as collecting kids in the 1980's, Lego sets we pursued came up against the likes of Transformers, Action Force, video games and regular bags of sweets. Painfully there were many wastes of time, money and plastic in the form of regretfully purchased short term toys. Much of Blacktron, Futuron and Space Police too easily passed by, the best sets remaining unaffordable or I would complain really hard to find. Here's one we managed to grab.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Black visor.</li><li>Black everything!</li></ul><div>Surely one of the best Minifigures of all time?&nbsp;His Vaderesque tubes and tech-plates detailed in white on the torso looked cool yet lift his sinister visor and even as a kid you could not help but like an 'enemy' who smiled this nicely.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Lego Zoid</b></div><div>This strange but cool sci-fi robotic beast walks on two large feet via four legs. Its a clever visual effect and its a better straight robotic design than many named 'Robots' that were often inferior. A chunky seat and cockpit is built on a base with the guns straight ahead. The rear of the seat gets red search lights for targeting prey which connect to the sickly yellow canopy hinged from the front. Each giant black wing shaped foot gets yellow turntables to hold the stanchion like dumb bell shaped legs. These sit lower and higher giving the appearance of a sinister lurch. The back section is on plates and there sits a chunky black hollow carapace that are sideways sat double diagonal panels. Hinges fold it down to sit between mounted red scanners while covering a little unit holding a yellow tools. This cavity could carry many things including a prisoner and its front end gets slanted off neatly. The entire cockpit clips on to a pegged front making two vehicle sections and a mini craft which is highly adaptable and good value play wise. The back definitely has boosters of sorts but the top holds clipped on lasers/batons/jets, I don't know.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Black Foot Forward</b></div><div>Where can you go wrong with a Blacktron set? They are all consistently uniformed as part of the same black and yellow army with a dominating dark presence in the entire Lego range that is rarely so predominantly black bricked. A really good build and imaginative design ensure a worthwhile purchase with this set but its in competition with better Futuron choices I would argue. It doesn't matter though, Blacktron did not improve with an updated design a few years later and so Blacktron collectors will love this, others may find it a useful introductory set to Space, and its continued silver age past the now categorised 'Classic' subtheme.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3
"Jack_Pumpkinhead","2020-06-19T04:22:04.233Z","Excellent set","<p>Space was never a big set for me growing up, but this guy was part of my modest collection.&nbsp; I always appreciated the look of this guy, it was so different from all my space ships.&nbsp; Honestly, I think part of me always got major AT-AT vibes off him.&nbsp; And even today, it has a nice, sleek design to it, giving it an old retro look.&nbsp; The back opens up to reveal some tools &amp; space for extra figures.&nbsp; The head can detach &amp; be it&#39;s own tiny ship, allowing for some nice extra play value as a scout or escape craft.</p>

"Gamlebilrokker","2020-06-23T11:55:35.02Z","Buy only if you are a completist.","<p>This is one of the worst sets of all times. I owned it as a kid, and it was in a lot I got recently for my son, it has five functions, and none works well.</p>

<p>The walking? Yea, no. The head comes off, but usually with half of the stuff that holds the neck in place (as in, 9 out of 10 times you break either the head, or the body of that thing).&nbsp;Opening or closing the windscreen will usually break something, probably the window will come off at the nose.&nbsp;The back opens on two fingerhinges that can bareley hold the cargo door open, the clips that hold the tools are not locked in in any way, so they tend to come off whenever you remove the tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are someone who wants to have everything from Blacktron, or have whatever else reason to complete your collection, get it. If you want this to play, leave it. Seriously, what a hopeless set that is. Not even 80ies nostalgia can save it.&nbsp;</p>
