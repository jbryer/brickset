Come with all the trademarks of M:Tron, transparent neon green pieces and a magnet holder and box. Its a great looking space craft as well, deffinately worth buying.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2008-01-12T21:33:37.123Z","4/5 great source for wings","   This set is really cool and has 5 great wing peices to use for other things .  The actuall set has a nice logo on the front, a typicall panel, two antennas that have two rotating hook bricks to lock down thye windsheild, a single m-tron figure, and 2 antennas.  It's not a bad set and i really enjoy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

As it is an M-Tron set, it's obviously used in some way to support mining of trans-neon green nodules. Of course, it has a small lockbox that attaches to the back via magnets, but I can see it also being used to scout for possible mining areas using the two side scanning cone sensors next to the pilot and transmitting the coordinates back to Mega Core Magnetizer using the two antennas on top. Then there is the possibility of defending M-Tron areas and vehicles with the two dish shaped weapons up front.

Pros:
-Great locking mechanism for the windscreen
-Two antennas mounted in a cool looking fashion
-Overall good form

Cons:
-Magnet in back should have been moved out a bit so it could easily haul the large equipment pallets found in big M-Tron sets
-Needs a place for a miner to sit behind the pilot",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p><b>The Vehicle</b></p>

<p>This search craft is a good looking&nbsp;spacecraft. There are several wing bricks which give a futuristic aerodynamic shape but with biplane wing charm. The nose cone features&nbsp;two green dishes (radars or lazers) topped with a printed M-Tron&nbsp;sloping brick. The top wings have thruster units attached underneath and there are two cone-shaped rockets underneath the main body. The cockpit spacious enough to allow&nbsp;the minifigure to sit with his airtanks on and the control panel is a standard M-Tron computer brick. The canopy is hinged at the front and has an ingenious but very simple locking device attached to the two antennas at the rear. Magnets and M-Tron&#39;s&nbsp;are an inseparable pairing and at the rear is a magnet holding a standard M-Tron container, you get two green light bricks to use as cargo. The magnet&nbsp;wobbles slightly but is securely fixed. Overall this isn&#39;t a complicated build but it does include a lot of wing and fin parts which are handy for building other craft with. It is also a&nbsp;sturdy build, even when flying it around the room by hand. The only nitpick is that there is nowhere to stow the hand-held&nbsp;Radio so the pilot has to carry it all the time.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard M-Tron&nbsp;figure with a hand-held&nbsp;Radio piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>Being of such a sound design with cool looks I kept this set intact until I could resist recycling its wing parts no longer, it&nbsp;needed few additions beyond a clip brick to hold the Radio.&nbsp;</p>
