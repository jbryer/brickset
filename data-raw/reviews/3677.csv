"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-09T17:51:33Z","Stevolteon@aol.com","I tend to overlook this model for some reason, but when I think about it it's actually very good. It looks good and is well put together, with a good selection of pieces. The radar assembly on the back ties it in to the satellite communication theme at the heart of Ice Planet, and can be put on Ice Planet - Commander Bear (6834). It has some unusual features - the reversed wings, the angled landing gear, the angled bricks concealing so much of the wing, but they all work. It suffers from Ice Planet open cockpit syndrome, but if they're going to ski about in those suits presumably they're nice and insulated anyway. Slight drawback in that the radar dish has nothing to stop it from spinning about in flight, and if the minifig's skis are a tight fit they tend to pull the modified plates they're attached to off, but those aside a very sound model for its size.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-04T11:35:55Z","Another good addition to an Ice Planet collection.","This is one of the sets that in my opinion made ice Planet Great. Its cool features like the detachable end make it cool to play with. The cockpit could be better but isn't bad. The main problem with Ice Planet is the lack of medium sized sets. The rocket launcher is bigger than this but isn't that big. Only two sets of the theme have more than one person in them. Apart from that this set is great and is a good addition to anyone's collection though it would be hard to find this set nowadays.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The movable skis enabled you to give it a crash landing which sometimes turned out alright as the skis would catch some of the shock.... or else they would break off and your Ice Planet dude would be stranded and/or dead.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

On both side flaps it shows a picture of the back of the vehicle with the satellite detached and the rear booster attached where the satellite usually is. The other two sides have the name in white ""alarm-clock style"" lettering, warnings, set number, and bar code. The back has three things that you can build using the pieces in this set. The three models pictured are a small base (in my opinion the coolest) that uses all the skis on a ski rack. There is also a satellite on top. The second model is a ground-based ski vehicle that uses the minifigure's chainsaw as the saw in the front of the vehicle. You can also build a satellite on top of a mound of snow. The third model that you can build is another base but this time with a laser and a smaller satellite.</SPAN></p>

<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">The completed model is well worth the $10.00 I paid for it. The ice saw is a pain because you have to swich the saw piece to the other side when you want the guy to hold it. The thing that holds the saw is pretty ingenius, though. The skis and satillite are easy to take off. One of the weirdest things in this set is that the control panel in the cockpit is in front of the steering thing. How's the guy supposed to get to them? Also, the cockpit is almost completely open.&nbsp;Other than these minor flaws the rest of the model is so well built it doesn't matter. </SPAN></p>

<p>This is one of the best Ice Planet sets and if you get the chance, you should get it. I also recommend getting at least one more to build the&nbsp;small base on the back and/or the other models. It can also be seen flying above in the Ice Planet track&nbsp;of the ""Lego Racers"" video game.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;a great set to add to any Space, Ice Planet 2002, or Lego Racers&nbsp;collection.</SPAN></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"KarolWes","2020-12-03T12:22:36.657Z","Ice planet rules","<p>Ice Planet 2002 was and still is one of the best subthemes of Space line. There are still many fans, who are making their models in this classic, white-blue-orange scheme. This set is a great example of whole series.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hkr3dFQKI7NCmC11WnJharqeQriPpj1w1l4gM2CNrdJVgUopcCvUEmbzUinNC5s2WHRugqJAZpWA8cGks-X4IvQVe70i3RYq86mCb-wdekdrCoTWvGKEh8pxuposieO33IKIQeEi3Z0=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Back in the days (set is from 1993) LEGO was making sets rather simple and not so big as now. But still, they always manage to add some nice features to the model.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iRpjZISx7j-E6-yUpP71_qgEOPcpnkJY3HxYrvRkotJd8WgSXuRvdg4PXOq_2dSgRG1XbzEWae3HkLcGHgRGESEk7VMX7yOAld05UBgpca6CmNlAW8YIe_JslW7LpWxSk8e4iBMEfH8=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>This set is medium (around the size of a hand). It has a space for one pilot. Astronaut is protected with a thin windshield, that doesn&#39;t necessary get its job done, but looks great. The nose is shaped well using 6x6 wedged nose plate. On top of that we got a blue 2x3 slope with a beautiful logo printed on it. In the cockpit there is a simple, printed console and a weird looking steering gear. On both sides of the canopy there are 1x1 bricks with stud on side, that are meant to be accessory holders. They work pretty nice, because attached chainsaws make a good &#39;walls&#39; for the ship. Unfortunately though, in the set there is only one chainsaw.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Oclb732WlldJ41dgJrIJgUmAYK1LntRfZ564o35FaiYU3bsvnjWd7R1W3EVVYfDQK7tpzh7u65-F0t9zTyLE_AXhOuW5guHVDoIvYHqwQwqANVrPl-EAGYpDGepQv_mp00wMxn-zwSQ=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>Moving to the back we got short wings with a blue grill tile as the only detail. Then,&nbsp;the whole build goes up, using very old, nearly spherical bricks. Those parts look&nbsp;great and I wish LEGO give them to us in some more recent set. At the top there is a pair of engines with trans orange dish, which looks cool, and a pair of ski holder. Also, there is a third grill, this time in white.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YwkwuyLOfN8d5UTlB5rIVmcH-_mC8Mf-6ScVsXlpisJgMxwg_hYNg7iGRfLjoj3lGv_GM2AePHqOJF-m7MF7UmbEGcIe2pkLiHu1a5i3vLeeVhgear1jt7osQcIJxhThWBteDMGT6FY=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>At the back of the whole structure, there is a brick with a technic pin hole, that allows to attach an additional segment to the build. This part is a sort of computer/communicator. It has a printed console tile and rotary antenna and satellite dish, both in trans orange. It looks very good, and expands a playability of the set. At the very rear of the ship there is a small additional engine in trans orange. It can be easily detached from the computer segment and add to the main ship. The whole craft can land on three pairs of translucent skies. Each one of them moves independently up and down.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>We got only one fig in this set, and this is a main character of the line. He is simply called &#39;Ice Planet male&#39;. He has plain black legs with blue belt. Torso has a logo and some breathing apparatus printed on. Also, near the neck there is a small imitation of a fur collar. Arms are white, hands - blue. He is equipped with old type oxy tank. His head has a simple print. It is a standard smile face, but with a long fringe added. It looks quite good, but to be honest, I never liked this face. Astronaut has also white helmet with trans orange visor and comlink - just like in every other set of the line.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/maMFokaTTXsjtfCczWRl0HYwlxbCW5ibtycJH4TwZRgLo-eVn0EYlHzru-IL_4mQEvgh38vSSh-qKycSFeLonUOvOCWch7Z3_nh2DnhOhm1L-ODuWmnfBov60qIoEGl8xduD6WcOq_s=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This is an old set and that means that there is not so many parts in here. 82 including minifig. But still, some of them are great. We got many bricks in trans orange. And though some of them (8 skies for example) are not so useful, the rest is quite unique and can be used in many models. Also printed nose and consoles has their potential. I also mentioned 3x3 quarter spherical part. It is a great part, but requires having four of them to make a full dome. We only got two in this set, but they are still nice. Rest of the parts is pretty generic.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set is one of my favorite. Probably because it was one of my first sets, but still, after 15&nbsp;years it looks great on my shelf. It has many nice features and overall has an interesting shape. So, if you are a fan of classic space (but not Classic Space) than this set should find a way to your collection at some point of time.</p>
