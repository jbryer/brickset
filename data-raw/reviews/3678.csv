It's very utilitarian with it's high raised platform, plenty of wheels to traverse any surface,  dual oppositional steering mechanisms for any terrain.  It digs up strange yellow moonbricks, or grabs odd black stick objects, then analyzes them on the lower computers and transmits the info up to the computer on the deck.  Which then gets beamed back to the main base via a big radar/comm array.  

It rates higher than a 3 but I can't justify a 4 because of its size and brickcount.  But overall its a great little set that could afford many hours of fun in the right imaginative hands. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I was more a town kind of kid but this space set was so different than any other that I had seen.  First off it was the first yellow spaceman I had seen.  The vehicle had tools all over it, and it seemed to be bristled with lasers.  I'd take the rifle off of the radar and that yellow guy was a space sniper.

I&nbsp;remember how excited I was that it had a yellow spaceman. All previous&nbsp;sets featured either&nbsp;red and/or white little spacemen!&nbsp;I also remember the mid-sized radar dish, and that strange new&nbsp;accessory that&nbsp;looked like a bazooka. This was also the first set that featured the new balloon tires.&nbsp;So much cool stuff in a medium sized vehicle!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My original set is missing many pieces, and the ones that are left are heavily worn. However, I&#39;ve managed to get a hold of another set on&nbsp;Bricklink. One that&nbsp;haven&#39;t been played with as much. The plastic has obviously become&nbsp;brittle with age, but the surfaces are shiny, it actually looks brand new! It is smaller than I remember, but the same can be said of other vintage sets as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play value is great, and it really lives&nbsp;up to its name. Those wheels make it able to tackle surfaces many previous sets had difficulties with. The long armed shovel made it ideal for gathering&nbsp;minerals. The grappling arm was also useful for loading ships, such as the 924 which lacked a ramp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no real front or back on this vehicle as there are steering wheels in opposite directions to each other. Although it only came with one figure it&#39;s practically a two seater. One spaceman can work the grappling arm while another spaceman can work the shovel. Effective! :-D</p>

<p>It&#39;s a unique and cool design! I love it! My kids love it! A true classic!</p>
