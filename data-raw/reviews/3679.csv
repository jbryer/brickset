","<p id=""yui_3_3_0_1_12998797328701926"">I honestly can't remember about  having this set until I was going through my instruction booklets. This  is one of only two space theme LEGO &reg; I have.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is long gone now, but I have kept the instruction and catalogue (as a wish list) all these years.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>I see blue, and lotsa blue! </p>
<p>This set features some exciting selection of parts, in blue. The very unique 2x1 blue brink with printed grill marks, rubber tubes, torch pieces, rocket parts, hinge pieces, red laser dish, sloped computer brick (mostly blue), and the articulated piece (in blue). </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>This spaceman dons the vintage helmet, but no visor. He comes with a walkie-talkie and video camera (!) which was a pretty rare accessories then.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I can't remember what I felt when I first built it,  but putting it together for the first time after nearly 20 years  certainly brings such nostalgia! Looking for the parts amongst a decade  worth of LEGO &reg; took much longer than the build, obviously.</p>
<p>The rubber tube gives a very nice random bending effect. But the rocket cradle can come off quite easily. A design flaw won't let the rocket sit horizontally, the cradle must be raised slightly to avoid having the rocket hitting the front part of the truck.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>

</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Full set of #6881 - Lunar Rocket Launcher with instruction leaflet.</span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I'd imagine playing this articulated vehicle, and a rocket could be a lot of fun. The two accessories to one minifigure ratio also scores high in my book. </p>
<p>Overall this set has a high playability. Unfortunately I'm just not into the whole space theme.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"Gamlebilrokker","2020-06-23T12:29:09.46Z","Meh...","<p>Many great bricks come together to become... This. What an odd set, the tip of the rocket keeps falling off, especially because when the ramp is down, the minifig hits it with his head (yea, even wehn he sits down). Then the rocket&#39;s boosters (the four 1x1 round bricks) are held in place only with the force of hopes and wishes, and have virtually no clutch power (why not have a 2x2 round brick there with some red 1x1&#39;s for &quot;exhaust&quot;?). And why does the&nbsp;rocket always wants to nose dive? Ehhh...</p>

<p>This was a part of a giant lot I got for my kid, so we simply have it now, but if it was a set we got based on the looks (looks cool), I&#39;d be disappointed...&nbsp;</p>
