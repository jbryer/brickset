"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-18T13:02:48Z","Looks Odd, but Has Great Playability","Now this is an original set! Back then, Lego was creative and this proves it. Two Windscreens close up vertically to form the cockpit of the Driver, who is a Black Spaceman :). The arm can be used to scoop up many things and can place these things into the blue storage containers. It will reach to the containers. The blue, gray, and trans-yellow color scheme is great, there are soo many rare parts. I am a proud owner of this model which I got MISB. I love the Astro Grappler and the Black Spaceman! Do not Hesistate to buy this set if you see it MISB, you will no regret it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-28T15:45:17Z","Woohoo! a Mecha attack vehicle! ","I went crazy over this set and bought something like 5 or 6 of them.  It's not *that* good...I mean, ok, it is! But it's simply not worth a 10/10.  You get sick of them after a while!  You just can't do that with truly good sets. 

I like this set a lot because the parts in it are cool...the black space figure is particularly good, and I like the grab arm.  I still feel the set is a bit flimsy though and lacking in content.  Perhaps if the set had included a robot figure or something it would have better.

I have the box and it's *REALLY* disappointing.  Earlier classic space sets featured lots of good alternate designs, even smaller sets.  This one only has 3 alternate designs.  The only one I really like is the spaceship one.  The alien design is pretty ersatz and not as good as all the classic space robots in other sets.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T21:14:41Z","A grabber arm that actually reaches the boxes!","  The thing that stands out in this model is the cockpit.  That's an inventive use for the window piece, just like in Space Dozer.  But what I really like is that the arm goes all the way to the compartments!  I can have it pick up stuff and stick it in there.  
Unfortunetly, the hind leg on mine keeps falling off!  I don't know if this is because of set design or a really old turntable.  But this is still a great set.    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-04T21:30:04.483Z","A real gem.","One of the most unusual Classic Space sets, this is an inspired design.  It has a walking mechanism and a fully jointed arm with a claw for picking up crates and equipment.  I think this would be the ideal set to use in a Lego stop-motion film.  Other points of interest are the unique cockpit design (pity this wasn't used more), the useful pieces and the nice colour scheme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Full credit to the designer of this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"T79","2015-08-21T09:26:24.69Z","Space Oddity","<p>Ground Control to Major Tom - er... wait, that&#39;s a different Space Oddity, no weirder than this contraption called &#39;Walking Astro Grappler&#39; though. A very unique design here, parts of it have later been reused in&nbsp;vehicles like #6925 Interplanetary Rover and #6876 Alienator but never again to the same effect.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No box in my attic, fortunately the instructions are still around. Another standard folding sheet with the&nbsp;sandy moon background guiding you through the build in 14 steps and with just enough room to feature a picture of one alternative build: some sort of ore (brought in previously by the Walking Astro Grappler itself, no doubt) sorting/refining station? I do like the small hoverchair with cargo container featured there though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A similar situation as in #6930 Space Supply Station: there&#39;s not a lot of parts, but what there is certainly is nice. Two windscreens (one opaque blue and one transparent yellow), four gray supports, a blue space chair, two transparent yellow hoses, two blue containers and of course that grappling arm. A ton of&nbsp;special pieces, standard bricks and plates amount to maybe one fourth of the included parts! A special mention for the ten blue turntables, I don&#39;t think we had another set which could rival this one in terms of turntables included. Certainly no blue ones, I think these ten were all we had in that colour.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The rarest of the classic spacemen: black. He still looks as good today as&nbsp;he did back then, and having the helmet with thick chin strap ensured that these at least did not crack so easily as so many others we had with the thin strap. He could have come with a tool though, there are two gray robot arms included but they are used in the build. And while we&#39;re at it, a printed control panel in place of that steering wheel would have been better too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>From the start it&#39;s made clear that you&#39;ll be needing a lot of 2 x 2 turntables. Those turntables in combination with plates and tiles is what makes the &#39;legs&#39; move. The same basic mechanism is used in #6872 Alienator but slightly refined (that&nbsp;set only needs six turntables and&nbsp;it uses less pieces overall for the walking mechanism). A nice addition at that time were those technic bricks with a half pin inserted allowing a robot arm to be connected to it. But especially worthy of mention is&nbsp;the cockpit: two 6 x 4 x 2 canopies placed vertically gives this walker a distinct appearance (in fact, I think we called&nbsp;it something akin to &#39;Space Dromedary&#39; when we were kids). Set #6925 Interplanetary Rover later used one of these canopies in the same way which was one of the best parts of that set. Interestingly, contrary to what you would expect, the space chair is not used to seat the astronaut but to create a rather random rocket engine - maybe?</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Did I already mention that this set looks decidedly odd and unique? That grappler was very popular back when I was young and it still is with my kids, it really is fun to move around (it can actually pick up pieces lying on the ground and store them in the containers, no need to imagine it)! The walking function works in a way, but only on flat terrain. No scaling crater plates with this walker, which kind of defeats the purpose (fortunately, imagination&nbsp;<em>does</em> come to the rescue here). The small robot arms and transparent parts on the back look nice but their function is less clear, unless that function is<em> </em>what can only be described as the lego equivalent to &quot;sois belle et tais-toi&quot;?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll not find another set like this, so if you&#39;re looking for unique vehicles you will certainly get what you want here! Or if you just want to keep the children quiet, this set still does that too :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: I have just found an old catalogue from 1987 and this set was actually&nbsp;called: Ruimterobotdrommedaris (sic, literally this is Space Robot Drommedary, spot the error)</p>

"rab1234","2018-07-13T18:36:15.803Z","Not the Best of Classic Space","<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>Originally I wrote this review and gave it a lower rating.&nbsp; After reading another review and looking at the set again, I came to a realization (I think) 30 years in the making.&nbsp; This is supposed to be a rocket sled and articulation on the legs is just to set direction?&nbsp; I always looked at it as a failed attempt at a AT-AT from star wars or something.&nbsp; I had this one as a kid as well, but I recently picked it up again in a bulk purchase of space and castle from the early 80s. The articulation is not what I expected and it is a bit of a silly design.&nbsp; Why would the back of the canopy not be clear as well?&nbsp; Why would anyone design a mobile unit to move by shuffling along like this (unless it really is a rocket sled)?&nbsp; Why is that spaceman so happy to be in this monstrosity?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>Nothing particularly wrong with the build on this one except for the realization that this thing is not going to be able to actually move in a traditional sense and is going to look silly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>A decent selection of classic space parts like canopies, gold hoses and a great spaceman, although it also has 4 of the large gray &#39;legs&#39; that are sort of useless in building your own stuff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>When I had this as a kid, I&#39;m sure it only lasted a week or 2 at most before being destroyed.&nbsp; This thing was not fun to play with due to the inability to make it move realistically. Even if you assume that it&#39;s a propelled sled, it can&#39;t really slide over lego base plates so why design it that way?&nbsp; The grabber arm provides a little bit of entertainment as well as the fully enclosed canopy, but this really deserves low marks overall on playability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>The only reason this gets 3 stars is that it&#39;s currently selling for around $25 for 1 minifigure and 87 pieces.&nbsp; If you happen to have purchased one at the original price, you can get your money back now.&nbsp; Even though I plan to sell mine (this comment will be against my own interests), I can&#39;t recommend anyone buying it over other sets, unless you&#39;re a completist of classic space.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-08-10T05:53:07.493Z","The most unique and dynamic Classic Space set","<p>This is without a doubt the best terrestrial Classic Space set out there and one of the best Classic Space sets period. It is completely unique as it is tall, wide, and lacks wheels. Even more unique is the way in which it moves, the legs swivel and the arm is snake-like in the way it bends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where the design of most Classic Space sets are easily imaginable, this set&rsquo;s design is completely out of this world. And it isn&rsquo;t just the way it walks, the vertical cockpit is awesome as well. The flexibility of the arm is incredible for a Lego set, and the hand can easily grab loose bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint is that it is very easy for the legs to fall off and come apart. And that isn&rsquo;t due to it&rsquo;s age, I remember that being an issue as a kid as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Cosmic Fleet Voyager (6985) is my favorite Classic Space set, this one is a very close second. There is no other Classic Space set like it.&nbsp;</p>
