I love transport space ships, and this craft is a small transport great for transporting droids and androids.  It is more of a hovercraft than anything, because the windsheld is far from airtight, but who really cares if it's airtight? I hate it when people complain about air tightness.  Anywho,,, the set is great and comes with a droid and a blue astronaut.  it is one heck of LEGO space ship.  Get it if you know what's good for your colection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Despite the fact that I like Blacktron series much better, <br>this extraordinary shape is actually how space ships should lok like (not only cargo ships) since <br>there is not important to have aerodynamic shape that suites Earth atmosphere.<br>Blue panel is great and there are just enough controls. We must accept that time when such crafts <br>will be flying around there will be revolution in development of commands.<br>All in all great set - from my point best futuron set. there is nothing to complain on this set.<br>Great refreshment in space series. When It was relished, I wanted desperately that my parents buy this set, <br>but had to wait for my 37th birthday to got it as surprise from my wife. <br><br>Just imagine how cool it will be in blacktron colors<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
