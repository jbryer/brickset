"T79","2014-08-19T12:53:07.243Z","Damn fringe world yokels are all alike, don't know where your priorities lie","<p>I don&#39;t remember playing all that much with this set, I guess most of the time it was disassembled and used to build a moon base (a few of those big panels go a long way). My children seem to like it but they are young and easily impressed ;)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Another set I can not find any instructions for anymore, fortunately they are on peeron. At first sight, only nine steps isn&#39;t much but they include numerous sub builds. A curious detail is the minifigure being assembled not at the beginning as is usual but only somewhere in the middle (he still has to wait until the last step to actually occupy the vehicle, him being assembled at step six seems to be purely to save space).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>At ~100 pieces this is not really a big set but there are several nice pieces included of which the main ones are the two white panel 4 x 4 x 6 corner concave and two transblue panel 3 x 3 x 6 corner convex (combine this&nbsp;with #6850 Auxiliary Patroller&nbsp;and start building a&nbsp;space station, if you have two of each you can get a fully closed station with just those big&nbsp;panels included). There are some more big parts: a black 2 x 4 - 2 x 4 hinge, two white bar 1 x 8 x 2, a white 6 x 10 plate and some big and very big tyres. No really rare parts but the blue parts are not too common: a 1 x 2 control panel, a 1 x 1 brick with studs on the sides and two taps. I&#39;m quite torn here, combined with some other sets you can really go wild but on its own it&#39;s a rather limiting selection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Again, only one. But what sets&nbsp;him apart is the colour of our Futuron astronaut: black! This was one of the rarer colours just like with his predecessor, the black Classic Spaceman. He also comes with a radio and robot arm tool thingy.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This, actually, is not too interesting. Mainly because it is over so soon with those big parts. And the &#39;cockpit&#39; (for lack of a better word) does not convince me and just seems slapped on to try&nbsp;and (fail to) balance with the rear. That rear dome is rather good if a bit fragile, and the small drone is nice too but overall I&#39;m not too fond if it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the spaceman&#39;s seat does not convince. Some bars mounted on loudhailers, preventing him from entering or exiting, surround his space chair&nbsp;which&nbsp;is left open to the vacuum of space. Unless those white disks are&nbsp;generating a shield&nbsp;he is left totally unprotected, a &#39;feature&#39;&nbsp;which is seen on more contemporary space vehicles but&nbsp;in contrast&nbsp;the robotic probe is protected by an almost&nbsp;fully enclosed dome. Now we know where Futuron&#39;s priorities lie (and it&#39;s not with their astronauts)! The rear lights on the dome point forward but I doubt present day traffic regulations were a concern at all here.&nbsp;The controls for the driver&nbsp;are a&nbsp;bit minimal, though. For the robot there is a control panel, for&nbsp;the entire vehicle one lever?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A rather unimpressive vehicle, it&#39;s not bad but not worth going out of your way for. At least there are some useful parts here and&nbsp;the black astronaut is also nice. Best part of this set&nbsp;is the playability which kept the total score at a &#39;three&#39;: it is fun shuttling the drone around and launching it to investigate various phenomena, the big wheels make for a pleasing ride over rough terrain. Only the connection of the dome&#39;s hatch is a bit fragile and prone to fall off when trying to open it or even align it properly.</p>
