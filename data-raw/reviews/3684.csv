"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T10:38:33Z","Not large, yet fun","For a patrol ship, this set was perfect. It looked a little slow in that it didn't really have enough engine power, yet was narrow and sleek enough that the design still worked. The little laser prison cells of the Space Police were ingenious, as were the small folding combat fins that could be stored inside the round black pods during interplanetary travel. I cannot tell you how many times this dude saved the peaceful, industrious Futuron people from the conspiring Blacktron -- note that he was always carrying another Blacktron prisoner.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T01:24:47Z","One of my all-time favorite sets","If not my ALL-TIME favorite ships.  It has pretty much everything you could want.  Removable prison pod, check.  Folding wings for extra fire power, check.  Cool hammer-head nose design, check.  Two mini-figs, yup.  This guy was ALWAYS my ace pilot, the best law-man in the galaxy.  

Dang, I feel like pulling out the set and remaking it...oh wait, I think it's still made, even though it's in storage.

This set has two minifigs and a prison pod. The two lasers can be moved inwards. Then they are hidden under the big black pieces with the &quot;Space Police&quot; print on it. So it's really a great set. Buy it if you are a fan of the Space Police series. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-16T19:42:27.817Z","5/5 gotta love the classics","   this set is a perfect example of a great set with endless playability.  This space ship is small, has two figures, and loadds of nice peices.  The trans red windsheild is my favorite part about this set.  The figurs are cool and come with pretty much every space plice 1 set.  the prison pod doesn't tend to fall of like it does in the picture.  The sets printed corner dome peices on each side are genious and make the set look that much better.  Two lasers swivel out of the domes when needed and retract just as easily.  There is only one small problem with this one.  The set looks a little plain when the prison pod is detached.  Which can be avoided very simply...leave it on.  Overall, a great set and remains cheap to get to this day.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cornwell","2008-05-03T20:52:13.153Z","Best kit there ever was","Whenever someone mentions LEGO, there are a few kits that always springs to mind. This is definitely one of them. One of the most excellent kits ever made.

The overall design is slick, and the extremely swept-back windshield makes it look built for speed. The weaponry is nicely tucked away underneath the pods on the side, and the drop-pod cell must be one of the coolest ideas ever. 

This craft was always locked in a deadly struggle with the Blactron &quot;Alienator&quot; (6876), which in a personal redesign had two missiles tucked away under it's hood, ready to launch.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This one introduced everything. It was the perfect toy for me at this time and it was great to play with it. A good and a bad guy (just to remember the police guy is the good one) a prison chamber on its back with feet to put it vertical. And a weapon system I just knew by Airwolf at this time (If sombody remember that TV series).
A very nice speedy shape makes it the mother of a good space ship design.

I just love it and it forces tears in my eyes when I think about the moment I got it. Thanks Grany!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-08-15T21:08:12.873Z","A classic","6886: Galactic Peace Keeper

This set was released in the year of 1989, and is a part of the Space theme, and &quot;Space Police 1&quot; subtheme. I personally considers this set (and the subtheme, too) as a classic, and I know that more people also consider it as a classic. This set at the first view looks like a bit simple, but not much simple. It is really simple, but isn't like a small set, It is like a medium sized spaceship.

It includes 115 pieces, all useful and with good color scheme. Some pieces such as the black colored panel 1x2x3 have printed details. In this case, it have a &quot;police&quot; (Space police) logo. Also, this set don't includes stickers.

The building, playability and design are very interesting, all makes it a classic set. I don't know why someone said that this set is multicolored, this have three main colors (blue, black and some translucent red parts), like in the current mars mission theme (mars mission have the orange, white and translucent blue schemes as main colors). This set isn't multicolored, it features a nice color scheme and design, like a classic set.

All the contets included are useful, of course, but this set don't includes tools or weapons to equip the minifigures. But it at least have accessories like jetpacks and helmets with visors for the two minifigures included. About the minifigures, I really like the idea to put two different minifigures from different subthemes in a set, in this set for example, you can get a space police minifigure and a futuron astronaut minifigure.

Both minifigures have differences, but their faces are the original minifigure faces, with few details but awesome in design (though simple). The minifigures have different colors and details, and are really classics due to their simple details and Lego original style.

The pieces included don't looks like to me as special pieces (called sometimes as &quot;overspecialized pieces&quot;), some are a bit different from bricks (like the 1x6 bar with studs open), but aren't special pieces, they aren't huge pieces with few studs, or Bionicle pieces (some Bionicle pieces being used in other themes looks like sometimes as &quot;special pieces&quot;). And some as the pannels with printed details are common, so are by extension useful especially among this theme. For who don't know, special pieces are pieces with big sizes and with few studs, or basically pieces without much good uses, just used in the set to increase the design but at the same time , these pieces can affect the building. 

The building is a bit basic. With instructions you can build it easily. The base of the prision (the &quot;prision&quot;, or the &quot;cage&quot; is a part that is fixed at the spaceship's back, where the futuron minifigure goes) is made by some plates and a  4 x 4 inverted slope brick. A window and two pannels with printed details increase it, making the little walls at the side and at the back. A black 1X4 plate without studs is fixed at the lower front part, and it reduces the space for the minifigure to a space of 1X2 studs, space enough to a minifigure stay in feet. Of course, it is a small space, but it is because the building here is a small prision (a cage).

Above the window (you can put a translucent red piece on the window), there are two plates connecting the pannels of the sides, and at the middle, there is a 1X2 plate with arm, to connect it after to the other part of the spaceship. The teat of the cage is made by a 4X4 slope brick, and it is connected in the cage by a hinge tile 1X4. It is also increased by other small blue plates, and above by a 2X2 black plate without studs. 

The part that makes the &quot;door&quot; (not exactly a door, because it is made by four red laser pieces) is a 1X6 bar with studs open, connected at the teat of the cage. Below, there are the red laser pieces, making the &quot;door&quot; of the cage. And at the sides of the bar, there are circular 1X1 red plates, just to increase it. The cage is very playable, and don't dismantle easily. The &quot;door&quot; is impressive, the laser makes it looks like more sci-fi, and it opens very well. Is a basic system, though works good.

Now, the other part of the spaceship.
The building is now a bit more complex, but still easy with the instructions. The base is made by a 2X8 plate with blue color scheme, and it is increased by some inverted slope pieces above. After it, the black long plates can be fixed. Some small black panels are used to increase a bit more inside, and some triangular blue plates (exactly one at each side) increases outside the spaceship.

Inside, some red light pieces are used to increase, and two Panel 3x3x6 corner convex with Space Police 1 logo printed details connects the back and front of the spaceship, using two 1X1 bricks with redlight to support, and these are fixed in each lower side of the spaceship (lower side, but inside the spaceship) by some 1X2 plates without studs.

At the front, a wing 3x4 with 1x2 cutout without stud notches (in other words, a small wing piece) increase this set a bit more (in terms of aerodynamic), helped by triangular plates at the sides. After this part of building, you just need to use a brick at the back, and some 1X2 plates with one stud, to fix the hinge plate 1x4 and after use the windscreen piece, finishing the cockpit. After it, you just need to connect the cage at the back of the spaceship, that is also very easy to do. 

The minifigure can stay sit at the cockpit very easily, and it have inside space enough to put a minifigure and have no problems of dismantle inside.

The building is very easy with instructions, and all the building involved in the set is well made, the spaceship and cage are hard to dismantle if you be a bit cautious. But of course, some old pieces can lost the resistance during the time, so you can have few problems with the windscreen and with the cage's &quot;door&quot; (laser gate, in other words). About the building, it is a 4,8 out of 5. Good for a medium sized set, only could be a bit more increased inside, but still nice.              

The playability is also very good, as a medium sized spaceship, of course it shows a good playability, it don't dismantle easily as I said before (but you have to know that sometimes the old pieces can lost the resistance due to the time), and as a building toy, you can make your creations or what you like with this, is very funny to play with. 5 out of 5 in playability.

The design is also very nice, but the windscreen is a bit strange, it could be a bit more increased, to don't show only one red translucent scheme. But, the color scheme still very good. It just needs few improvements in the sides and at the front. The design still around 4,6 out of 5.

So, here are the basic Pros and Cons about the set:
-Pros:
Good color scheme
Great playability
Decent building
Useful contents (especially in this theme)
-Cons:
Few tools to the minifigures 
A bit simple in building

Now, if you search this set, you have first to know that the rarity makes the prices higher than before. But a easy way to get this set is by the internet. You can find it at Ebay (currently) by $10.45, and it ships by worldwide. But as Ebay is a site with bids, the price usually changes to higher. But this price is very good, as a rare and cool set, it worth really. Also, you can find it by Bricklink.com by a price around $15 to $20. You just have to know where the store ships to. All these prices are good, this set worth the money, and have exactly 115 pieces. I recommend it for any Lego fan (of course, especially Lego space fans) who are searching for an old spaceship with a decent size (not so big and not so small).

Overall, this set is nice, I saw no much problems on this, the color scheme (design), contents included, playability and building, though a bit simple, makes this a classic. It is so a 5 out of 5.
Hope you enjoyed the review.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-29T07:49:38.5Z","Keeping the peace, sheriff?","This is another set that shows space police from 1989 was the best one. First of all, it has one of the detachable brillian blacktron jail cells. It also has the perfect number of laser gun (four) which is way better then space police two, because most of the ships had two weapons or less. The only thing about space police I i don't like is the color scheme of the minifigs, but since he's in the cockpit of this amazing ship, that's not very important.

These bars lift with a partially slanted roof that allows access. The feet are like small thrusters with two more hang in above like lamps. This suggests it can be jettisoned and even have a degree of movement alone.</div><div><br></div><div>I never liked the blue colour in Space but it worked fine for me with Space Police. More slanted gullies in blue hold a sturdy black plate frame. This structure takes on smooth low panels to slide in the prison pod and mounts wings, hinges, red lights, retros, an onboard computer and odd diagonal badged black side panels, tailor made to lock into two spaced headlight bricks.

"SharpFranc","2011-06-19T18:02:29.36Z","Younger brother of 6781","At the time when space police appeared I was dreaming about 6781 but unfortunately it was too expensive so I bought this set. There were many reasons at this time to like it, for instance the new type of long windscreen, the color scheme was wonderful, you got the jail cell and two minifigs. And hidden by default weapon was another advantage.<br/>This space ship at on the box looks rather small but it is not. Especially when you get weapons out of these pods.<br/>It is rather cheap and worth it's money although i still can't say why it is ranked higher than 6923 - 6886&nbsp;provides definitely less features and is smaller. 4.5 should be enough.",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
