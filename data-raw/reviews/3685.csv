"KDog","2008-02-24T22:01:30.263Z","Fierce Little Fighter","This is a neat little ship that looks fast and fierce. It also has a bit of an insect appearance, like it's a precursor to the Insectoids. I suppose it is the replacement for the Blacktron I Invader (6894) as a mid-sized, one-man fighter craft. The Allied Avenger is stubbier than then Invader and does not include a middle section and robot. However, the front bubble and back section do separate. I'm not sure what purpose the back section serves, but the little bubble-craft the front becomes is nifty and a trademark of Blacktron II. Another nice touch is that the wings fold together. Al in all, a nice, pleasing design that's fun to swoosh.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T17:15:32.17Z","About 20 years after the X-wing was born","Obviously this does have an x-wing like appearance, due to its x-shaped wings, but I doubt that's this sets designers were thinking of at the time. This is a really cool starfighter, not lacking the signature Blacktron II cockpit (though no official printed tiles or slopes were made like in most other space series, only the large panel with the B on it).

The ship has the awesome control stick and what's cool is that the arrows add a nice effect to the detail on the ship. the twin antennae are also a nice touch and the two &quot;torches on the outside of the cockpit make a cool detail, almost like a tube or vent. The two cones at the top dont take away from the look, they just add to it. Finally, as a last touch, when landed, the back part does not tip over, even when the cockpit is detached.

Any LEGO space fan should want this (or already have one).

Unfortunately, this set, due to its age and poplarity, is kind of pricy nowadays, so if you see a decent chance grab it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Amazingly designed and in only 100 pieces + 1 Blacktron II minifig.<br><br>Black and white, with yellow translucent as Blacktron identity. It's perfect. The cabin is removable and could be rotated 360 degrees if not for this piece (Black Wedge, Plate 3 x 4 Without Stud Notches). The wings (hold to some hinges Plate 1 x 2 with 2 / 3 Fingers) are hinged but 2 to 2, ie there are 90 degrees fixed between the side wings. However wings can do different positions -up&amp;down-. The arrows are serigraphed.<br><br>It is a simple craft with tremendous playability, and also modular (detachable cabin).

"T79","2016-03-10T10:28:26.053Z","Doesn't look like it is made out of only 100 pieces!","<p>While not the last Lego set I received and played with, this set does have the distinction of being the last Lego spaceship I&nbsp;got before it all went into plastic boxes to be stored in the attic. That is, until a little over a year ago when I took it all out for my children to play with :)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I no longer have the box, but the instructions are a small booklet with 10 + 14 steps and a few small sub builds. Considering the low part count these are quite a lot of steps for the time. The instruction&#39;s background is still an evocation of&nbsp;sandy moon dunes, similar to the instructions of all space themes which came before but not entirely the same (colour and texture of these dunes varied slightly between instructions from e.g. Classic Space, Blacktron I and M-Tron, and now again with Blacktron II).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Only 100 parts but they included some good spaceship pieces of which several were quite new to us:&nbsp;one black 2 x 4 x 2 brick with studs on the sides, one white round 2 x 2 x 2 brick with fins, three black 4 x 2 x 2 tails, five black 2 x 2 - 2 x 2 brackets, two black 2 x 2 plates with engine,&nbsp;nine 1 x 2&nbsp;tiles with grille and finally four black wings 8 x 8 with 4 x 4 cutout.&nbsp;That last part&nbsp;only came in this set aside from one in #6923 Particle Ionizer! There were five printed tiles included, one quite common 1 x 2 with arrow and four less common&nbsp;round 2 x 2 with arrow which could only be found in Blacktron II sets and an accessory set. Also some transparent parts, all in&nbsp;trans-neon green: a pair of&nbsp;whip antennae (very common), a 3 x 2 x 6 panel (common) and a pair of 6 x 6 octagonal canopies (only found&nbsp;in Blacktron II sets but in rather large quantities). The strangest part for me was the inclusion of one very standard, very plain,&nbsp;white 2 x 8 brick -&nbsp;which was our first, for some reason.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One Blacktron II minifigure, as far as intimidation factor is concerned a&nbsp;huge step&nbsp;down from Blacktron I (maybe those minifigures&nbsp;were judged <em>too</em> evil so they were toned down a bit?) with all the white, the big &quot;B&quot; logo&nbsp;and the transparent visor. Then again the entire line&#39;s colour scheme is toned down, from the&nbsp;black/(trans-)yellow/black/trans-red/more black of Blacktron I to the black/white/trans-neon green of Blacktron II the&nbsp;new look is decidedly less dark. He doesn&#39;t come with any tools, though included in the spaceship build are two torches and (our first) a chainsaw body.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Construction starts with the cockpit module, a variation of which was found in most larger Blacktron II sets and could be swapped between spaceships. Using the trans-neon green panels it made for a fully closed cockpit (aside from some tiny gaps, it <em>is</em> made&nbsp;out of&nbsp;Lego), in fact this was our smallest spaceship which could boast of having an &#39;airtight&#39; cockpit. The chainsaw body is used nicely as controls, reminiscent of #6982 Celestial Forager but without a printed tile which is a bit of a shame. I quite liked the white 1 x 1 cones used on the panel which look like they power the opening mechanism of the cockpit and the torches which look like a cockpit venting system. Then comes the engine module: bricks, hinges, brackets&nbsp;and wings&nbsp;build a long, slender form with 4 wings in an X-shape. Just why it has to be detachable is not really clear but it allows for an extra play feature by having the engine module used for interstellar travel or the cockpit module as an escape pod.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It definitely looks the part: a sleek, powerful spaceship; the movable wings are a nice extra. They do not move like the wings on an X-wing, rather each pair of wings moves as one so what really changes is the angle between the upper and lower legs of the X, not the angle between the right and left legs (which is fixed at 90&deg;). The spaceship is rather undergunned - as are most Blacktron II sets - with only two 1 x 2 plates with handles as &#39;weapons&#39;, so we usually gave Blacktron I and II different roles: Blacktron I as brawny pirates and Blacktron II as stealthy thieves. It&#39;s a small spaceship but still a lot larger than its humble piece count would lead you to believe, for example, #6824 Space Dart I and #6830 Space Patroller are both around 50 pieces but look a lot smaller than just half of the Allied Avenger, while #6886 Galactic Peace Keeper has 20 pieces more and still is the smaller of the two.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With&nbsp;just 100 pieces the designer(s) managed to create a nice and, for it&#39;s piece count, rather large spaceship with a fully closed cockpit to boot, a rarity&nbsp;among our&nbsp;small spaceships! Detachable modules and movable wings give it some extra playability besides just swooshing it around the room. I agree with a previous reviewer,&nbsp;this is as good as a spaceship can get with only 100 parts!</p>
