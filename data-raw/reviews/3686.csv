This set almost required that you had a friend or a brother who also had it, because then you could engage in ROBO-FIGHTS! On the downside, the back wasn't armored so the enemy robot could get behind you and kill your pilot. But still, TOTALLY SWEET!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2008-01-14T14:18:15.733Z","5/5 best of spyrius","   I like this one the best for several reasons.  The first being that the figure has a control station in the robot to give the idea that he controls it sort of as a battle machine.  I also like that it comes with the spyrius cheif.  The trans. red panel is also great.  It also has a carrying case, 6 wheels, cool accecories, and a good selection of pieces.  No cons as far as i can see.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-12-17T13:39:14.81Z","One of the greatest LEGO Robots around!","I got this set off of Ebay for fifteen bucks. After building it I realize it was worth every penny. The set is extremely well constructed, study, and detailed. It comes will cool decal tiles, accessories, moving arms and six wheels. This is the kind of thing Robo-Force should have been- neat designs with wheels instead of legs that don't work! 

You get one minifigure, which is good, but I wouldn't have minded another one. The head is nice, if a little goofy looking. It has no obvious weaponry, but who cares- it is a RECON robot after all! 

Awesome little set and recommended if you can get it for twenty bucks or less. I was very pleased and I think most Space fans will agree! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-25T02:28:50.81Z","When Classic Becomes Legend","This model had to be one of my favourite models as a child. I think I spent more time with it than any other one particular model. Being aware of this I will try to keep this review as unbiased as possible.

This is the smaller of the two Spyrius robots. I wanted the big one but I grew to love this one and yes it is a sweet model to make an army out of. I will be buying another couple. The colour scheme of the robot is mainly back with some red and a touch of neon yellow.

Firstly unlike today's robots he is on wheels. Six to be exact. This is great for rough terrain or in the even of loosing traction on one wheel there are five others to pull it out as opposed to three. Also they make a very the robot very stable, not top heavy it the case of a fall over and don't have week points like ankle and knee joints. 

It then thins slightly in the waist to give it shape and make room for two lasers at head level. Also a compartment at the back for weapons that is 3x2x2 hidden in the robot and a box at the front for storing small things. Above that is the manual controls for the droid, with a place for the controller to sit and see through a pain of red glass (Very dramatic). 

Te robot the really broadens out into the arms, which by today's robot standards look quite thin and weak but, due to the hinges and design used they are actually quite strong. They move 180 degrees at he shoulder up and down and about the same at the elbow and wrist, giving him the ability to reach 360 degrees at some points. He can also reach from his wheels to above his head, allowing for full frontal attack and defence. Each arm has twin laser guns mounted at the wrist allowing for shooting to be done in every direction.

His head rotates 360 degrees and is made up from one big block and lots of little blocks to make up the facial features. The hose running from the back of his head to the front of his face can be used as anything from a speaker to a flame thrower depending on how violent you wish to get with this thing. His eyes are round neon yellow 1x1 and really stand out against the model.

The controller is dressed in black pants with a red waist line, blue shirt, red helmet, black oxygen tank, red gloves and a neon yellow visor. His shirt and helmet both have a pattern on them and his has a blaster ad a remote control. The remote control is for the robot and helps extend the imagination during play and increases playability.

Overall this model was just the best. I had so many hours fun with it and im sure others did too. The instructions were simple, it's aesthetics and playability are through the roof for being as old as it is. Places to put things and lots of flexibility you just couldn't go wrong. I feel this model is a definite 10/10. If you like space this is a must and for anyone who like top quality models this ones for you. A must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-01T15:03:21.937Z","better then the other one","This recon robot is really cool because he has a face. The minifig he comes with looks truly ready to go steal techonalagy and valuble data. The robotg has ten wheels and two arms and really looks quite futuristic. So this set gets a 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"NickBrick","2010-11-12T17:08:02.343Z","Spyrius. You got it. We steal it.","<p>I recently got into Classic Lego space sets, so I bought this off bricklink. The recon robot is a fine set. And pretty unique from Newer stuff like Space police III. I will start my review from its wheels up. The recon robot rolls nicely on six wheels. just above the wheels are some heavy laser guns. in the back is a little hatch to store the Spyrius chief's Laser gun.</p><p>&nbsp;In the front is another hatch to hold some stolen tech. above that is the cockpit. This robot was like a version of Exo-force, nearly a decade before Exo-force was released&nbsp; The chief can be seated in the back. Now comes the bad part of the set. The arms. While they can pick up mini-figures and stuff like that, they are skinny and make the set look a little weird.And finaly my personnel favorite part the Recon robot. Its head. It can turn at a 360 degree angle, And it can take secret video from a camera on top of its head. And now we come to final part of the set. The mini-fig. It definitly has a classic space look and has a printed helmet. The face is also quite good to.</p><p> One of the most important things to me in a set is,does it look aged? I am happy to say that it doesn't. it could work with almost any Space theme quite easily. I am enjoying this set and I hope you do to. With only one fault and a boat load of good suff I can definitly Recamend this set for you. Thanks for reading my review and I hope it was helpful.</p>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
"James83","2017-08-25T15:14:36.353Z","Wrong Arm of the Law","<p>This was the first Spyrian set I brought, I think I was attracted by the novelty of the robot and this proved to be better set than I thought it might have been.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The robot is quite tall and scales quite well against the Lego minifigure and is very stable despite its height. It rests on six wheels which provides the stable base and plenty of traction. The lower section contains a small 3x2 stud storage space, ample room to store the hand-held torch/weapon and a few other items of stolen loot. The door is nicely detailed with vent bricks, my only nitpick is that it doesn&#39;t lie flush with the back of the robot when its closed. One each side can be found a torch/lights that can be swiveled up and down. Further up there is a container for storing stolen computer chips etc., with some nice detailing behind it with circular bricks.</p>

<p>Sitting above this is the cockpit with its recessed red windscreen, the use of the inverse sloped black bricks look particularly good. The cockpit is equipped with a 2x2 sloped printed computer brick showing an outline robot which is neat. It is small however and again a minor nitpick is that when the pilot is sat inside it, his airtanks stick out of the back. The roof of the cockpit forms the base of the arms. These are more sturdy than they first appear and the grabbing hands are actually quite effective at holding small items (these should have been used on the 6939 Saucer Centurion&#39;s grab). The is more than ample movement with three sets of hinges so grabbing and moving items is easy. The head cleverly resembles a face and turns 360 degrees and has an array of vents and lights for &#39;eyes&#39; and a flexible tube which looks like some form of&nbsp;camera unit. Two radio stalk antennas completes the head. Another good point is that the Spyrians were the last sub-theme to rely on printed bricks rather than the sticker-heavy themes which followed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with the Spyrian&nbsp;Chief, who unlike other sub-themes was less rare, appearing in four sets. He has the same torso as a standard Spyrian, the only differences being the red helmet with printed circuits and the printed face with black pointy eyebrows and stubble. For hand-held tools he gets a torch/laser gun with neon green light brick and small printed circuit board brick.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>The basic design is sound and is quite interesting and is well executed with no major flaws at all and its actually more usable than you might think at first. The arms work very well and this robot has enough size for a mid-level set to be quite imposing. You can make it bigger if you wish by adding another stage or making the chassis longer, so its really quite adaptable. This was inventive Lego at its best.&nbsp;</p>
