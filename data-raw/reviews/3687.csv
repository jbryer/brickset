"vynsane","2010-05-24T13:10:35.03Z","A classic among classics","This set was a mainstay of any space fleet I played with as a child. One of my earliest Classic Space sets, it REALLY set my imagination whirling and made me a LEGO Space lover for life (even if I forgot for a while). My recently reignited love for all things LEGO caused me to look for some of my favorites from my childhood and this was one of the first sets I looked for. Having reacquired it, I now present my review as untainted by nostalgia as possible (probably not very).<h4>Figures</h4><div>This set only comes with one figure, but it's a classic red Spaceman, full with 'Classic Space' logo emblazoned upon the chest. There's not much more to say than that.</div><h4>Accessories</h4><p>The minifigure gets a color-matched airtank/jetpack (I always pretended it was a jetpack as a kid - that's just way cooler than an airtank, seriously).</p><h4>Build</h4><div>The build is pretty standard fare for Classic Space, with a body shape mainly made out of 4x8 wings (this time in white). There are some surprises, though, including the split-wing design (two 4x8 wings on either side, with a 2x6 opening in the middle) and the secondary vehicle, a speeder bike sort of rover that docks inside of the larger ship, locked in place by a 1x2 hinge-driven mechanism. This was a design revelation to my young mind, and still remains one of the coolest features of any LEGO spaceship. Other classic touches like the control thrusters, the 1x2 plate w/handlebars (I mean, w/LASER GUNS) and printed pieces are all accounted for. I do have to point out, however, that as a kid the gaps in the bottom of the ship bothered me, since that means it isn't air-tight.</div><h4>Parts</h4><div>I was surprised to find out how rare some of the pieces included in this set are. The 3x6 'windshield' slope in solid blue, with the SMALL printed 'Classic Space' logo is actually exclusive to this set (seriously, it only shows up in this set)! Similarly, the transparent dark blue 3x6 windshield slope is only found in a handful of sets. Other cool parts include the transparent dark blue hinge plate used as the roof of the ship, the rocket boosters on the 'speeder sled' secondary vehicle and the&nbsp;maneuvering&nbsp;control thrusters. There are six printed pieces in all:</div><div><ul><li>Classic Space logo torso in red</li><li>3x6 slope w/small Classic Space logo in blue</li><li>2x3 slope brick w/Classic Space logo&nbsp;in white</li><li>1x4 bricks w/grille pattern&nbsp;in blue (x2)</li><li>1x2 brick w/grille pattern in gray</li></ul></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>This set is a great example of how cool Classic Space was, even in the smallest of sets. The fact that you can still find this set for a decent price after so long is great, because future generations can continue to appreciate the true classics. It's easily one of my 3 y/o daughter's favorites!</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<p>The color scheme matches his big brother 6980 which appeared one year later in the catalogues.</p>

<p>The small shuttle looks like a light version of 6842, which is not a bad thing.</p>

<p>The idea of inserting a shuttle into a bigger spaceship (for longer journeys?) is great, and it is among the first modular models lego released. It might even increase the play value compared to its predecessor 918, which i absolutely love for its design and aesthetics but which is also more static.</p>

<p>The part selection is useful, the look is futuristic. It was not common to include little robots at that time, those appeared three years later. At that time, this little gem has already disappeared from the regular sale. So the inclusion of one single spaceman is a good choice. And to be honest, whoever built one classic space model will buy more and more, so an army of spacemen wil be there sooner or later&nbsp; ;)</p>
