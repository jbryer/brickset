"Jupiter","2007-02-28T16:12:56.013Z","Meteor Hunter","... as it was called in my language. This ship looks dangerous!
It contains a lot of interesting pieces: the green window, the wing parts, the laser cannon on the rear, the rocket engine, and the gray and black engines under the wings. The black spaceman is one of my favourite minifigures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-03-30T13:30:48.047Z","Lovely craft.","This was known as 'Dark Star' in the UK Lego catalogues.  It's sleek, well-designed and really looks capable of fantastic speeds.  The front detaches to form a smaller craft, the back contains a cargo hold and the colour scheme looks great.  Nice little android as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jsosse","2009-05-28T22:43:13.95Z","Oh, what a ship!!","It was not my first set, but it was my first fairly sized one - before that, I only have had smaller sets, since all Lego were imported (and therefore expensive) here in my country.

And, boy! What a thrill it was to get, build and play with this one! 

It was amazing that it could detach in two different ships, one for fast ""hunting"" and the other for more lenghty and important ""missions"". The mid-ship reactor, the hoses connecting it to the flapping wings and the little blue robot were just amazing. And, if I'm not that much mistaken, this blue friend stands alone - or almost alone - as a Legoland Space robot.

The amount of new odd-looking pieces, such as the reactor parts, the smooth tiles and the wing shapped plates opened a whole new world of possibilities.

And, as somebody already said, its color scheme was just awesome and standed alone among other space sets. It really gave the ship a kind off 'stealthy' look - or so I claimed while playing with my brother!

Although I donated this set in the early nineties to kids on a orphanate, I never forgot how much I loved this set. So much that, today, I feel almost as anxious as when I was a kid, waiting the used set I bought on an auction gets delivered...

"K_nut","2011-05-23T19:59:12.35Z","Commander Schwartz's own starship!","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Oh that's right! I'm a follower of KDog's hilarious space comic too!<h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Minifigs</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This&nbsp;set includes one of the best minifigs of all time, the spaceman. No, he's not the <i>classic </i>spaceman, he's the one, true spaceman. The spaceman always had that certain charm to him. Though nowhere as detailed as the new Space cops or ADU soldiers, the spaceman is one of the best minifigs ever. The spaceman was equipped with&nbsp;air-tanks&nbsp;in black, (Which&nbsp;I thought was a&nbsp;jet pack&nbsp;until recently) and a classic black crash helmet. This is Commander Schwartz.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The blue robot is simply a master piece! Known as G-bot in the comics, This was back in the time of brick built robots, and it was certainly one of the best.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Front Ship/Cockpit</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>As the title says, This is Commander Schwartz's craft from our own member&nbsp;KDog's</div><div>very own space comic.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.drunkduck.com/Lego_Space/index.php?p=358243"">http://www.drunkduck.com/Lego_Space/index.php?p=358243</a>. The front cockpit has a rare green colored windshield and and a front blaster that looks like kissy lips. This set is the twin of 6931. There is a nice <i style=""font-weight: bold; "">printed </i>slope for a control panel. I bold printed because I am one of the many who loves printed pieces and hates stickers. There are some nice trans-red bits on the front of the ship to. The back of the front section has a nice black laser cannon.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Back Ship/Cargo</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>I split the front and back into two sections because they are setachable as you can see here.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.drunkduck.com/Lego_Space/index.php?p=396037"">http://www.drunkduck.com/Lego_Space/index.php?p=396037</a>.&nbsp;The front of the rear section has a small cargo bay. If you take the robot apart, you can barely squeeze it in there. Right above that is a weird, web looking thing. I'd say it's solar power tile, but you can't get solar power in space, can you? Moving to the very rear, there are two wings made of black and light grey/bley parts. On the top&nbsp;of&nbsp;the ship there ships rear there his a huge honking gun! Itself has some very useful parts. Fried aliens anyone?</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Conclusion</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The Gamma V is a very nice starship, back in the beginning days of Lego. It's design has that very classic feel to it. The best part of it is that in those days minifigs had no names! Your imagination could roam free! It is sadly underrated, but it is a very great ship if you can find it nowadays for a reasonable price.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"bricksofcanada","2021-02-16T13:50:26.997Z","Beautiful. ","<p>one of my favourites, this set is the perfect spaceship for its time. I tend to prefer sets from 1980-1990 because of the simplicity, (not because i cant build well) but because newer sets seem to have too much detail for me to handle. with a nice blend of play features, (the robot has got to be the best part)&nbsp;this set is definitely&nbsp;on my list of the greatest. interesting features include: front part snaps of, robot, and side doors. not much, but fun for its age.</p>
