I loved the colour scheme and the shape of the model and the fact it would split into 3 parts was an added bonus. I was quite disappointed after building it, as very little thought appeared to have gone into the model. The front section has no visible means of propulsion and there is no method for getting the rear section onto the ground (although, there is no reason to detach the rear section as there is nothing in it). A small number of similar pieces limits the alternate models which could be produced. Detach sections, re-attach sections . . . yep, thats about it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It is certainly a nice-looking set, but unlike 6926 the ground-base is completely empty and almost totally exposed.  Not only that, but the detached mid-section serves no apparent function.  Still, a nice model and a good selection of useful pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

But the overall set is ugly and looks as though the designers had spare parts and came up with this thing.  On the plus side, the set adapts to its namesake; that is, the front and rear sections can separate from the mobile section.  The front detaches and acts as a mini craft while the rear functions as a base of sorts.

After that though, the set pretty much lacks clear purpose.  The wheeled section seems to be something that just gets the two space guys from point A to point B.  Well, why have a flying ship attached?  Then the little rear base-like section really is a pointless item.  It's very hollow, slides into the back and is secured with a hinge that lowers.  But the rear tends to easily come apart because it's just really flimsy in the design.

I've always felt that the parts have more value than the design.  You could easily combine the parts here with another set to add more value.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"HappyStikBeaver","2012-02-21T22:31:53.753Z","Descent set, not much to it.","<p>This set had potential, but it is very simple and not that interesting. The designers added a modular aspect, but it doesn't work perfectly and it leaves the set looking somewhat unfinished. The back section, which is removable, has a nice shape but is completely uncovered and left as a shell. The details are lacking and there is next to nothing on the inside. Another problem is the fact that when on the ground, the removable section doesn't even come close to lining up with the vehicle, and it must be lifted to put it back on. The cockpit, which is also removable, looks very nice on its own. As always, I'm a fan of clear yellow windows, and this one looks great. This portion has a cool printed control panel which looks nice with the other blue pieces. The blue half gates make a nice look for the sides of the pod. On the color scheme, I'm not a big fan of blue paired with white, and I prefer light grey much more. However, this set maintains a good balance of the colors and it'e not as distracting as some similar sets.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Clear yellow window</li><li>Modular</li><li>Hidden wheels</li><li>Nice selection of parts</li><li>Printed arrow pieces</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Very little detail</li><li>Technic bricks showing</li><li>Somewhat hollow</li><li>White instead of light grey</li><li>Modular sections don't line up on the ground</li></ul>
<p>All together, this is still a great Classic Space set, with a nice parts selection and a few decent features. However, I would suggest a few others before this one.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
