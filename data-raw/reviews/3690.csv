It is a one of new genaration  LEGO space. The astronauts had a helmet with really moving sun shield. In the trailer is a drone. Backside doors you can open and in the back is ramp. This set are ideal for intermediate builders. Much  special space piece,two interest mini-fig and space ship in three diferent form. I was played a long hours with this space ship - it is a space truck or fighter bomber or a flying caravan... I preffered always -city and especially a police sets -but this set is one of my best toys across a time.The yellow astronaut i have today -after sixteen years is still as new!!! Oh,this is a really good quality!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I have lots of memories with this set. I have build 100s of different space ships and discover the unknown spaces in a kids brain :) Not lots of pieces but very great opportunity to create several dreams.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

These are still nice builds today with a distinctive design and great playability.</p>

<p>To me, this specific set is a bit odd (or special) in <strong>design</strong> &ndash; being less &quot;dynamic&quot; than the other futuron ships &ndash; i remember this as the camper or caravan in my spaceship collection, used for vacation :-)</p>

<p>The <strong>build</strong> is interesting and non-repetetive. The instructions from that time are a bit harder to follow for children, but of course it&#39;s not really a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong> in this are rather standard, except for the two big octagonal shells in the back part of the spacecraft. There are also some nice windscreens and blue dishes which are always welcome. Parts with design are printed like all from that era. You get two futuron minifigs, but only in the most common colours blue and yellow &ndash; red would have been cool to match the colour scheme of the spacecraft.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong> is great with this: as usual, you can split the spacecraft in parts &ndash; the front and central part can act as spacecrafts or rocket seats of their own, while the back part could serve as a housing on a planet surface. (It would have been specially cool if one could have split the front part into left and right subsections ... potential for a small modification.) There is a small wheeled robot that can be packed away in the back part of the craft for transport and be unloaded over the rear. The &quot;shells&quot; on the back part can open, but there is not really a function attached to it &ndash; guess they only can do that as the parts used provide this, not because it&#39;s intended.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t say a lot about <strong>value</strong> for money from when this was released. Today, bricklinking might cost some dollar as the octagonal shells are not cheap, but it&#39;s definitely not too painful if you are eager to complete your futuron fleet.</p>
