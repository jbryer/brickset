"zinkk757","2007-12-28T18:07:36.937Z","10 instant classic","     I just got this one pretty cheap but it was a great deal and worth the money.  The color scheme of blacktron 1 was put into use very well in this set.  The robot in the center compartment is pretty cool as well.  I love the design of the front cockpit and the 4 fins in trans. red on the back section.  overall, it's a great set.  You should definetely get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-04-06T13:45:23.34Z","Fantastic.","As with all the sets in the first Blacktron range, this has a dramatic colour scheme, a well-thought-out design and looks great.  The ship can be seperated into three segments, the middle one containing tools and an android.  Those posable transparent-red wings are a nice touch as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dim","2010-03-10T15:44:40.92Z","Sleek and nicely resolved","<p>This was the second from last set I bought as a kid. At that age I must have been slightly dim (hence my nickname), because I hadn't realized that Blacktron were the long anticipated villains of Lego Space and I was puzzled by the&nbsp;unusual for a Space theme colour combination and the lack of the Classic Space insignia, replaced by the triangular badge. I was also a bit disappointed because to my eyes Blacktron looked more conservative than Futuron. However this set changed my mind:</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Design</em>: This set looked as sleek as it could get with the parts available back in 1987. I think it would look even better if the more tapered windscreen of early 90's&nbsp;was available back then, but still the ingenious usage of castle corner walls that formed the cargo section gave a beautiful, stud-free, roughly octagonal section. The rare transparent rear winglets looked also very futuristic, something between wings and solar panels. Also a great plus&nbsp;is that the cockpit is airtight, which only makes the spaceship even sleeker. Something that the larger <em>Renegade </em>did not offer. Somehow I feel that the <em>Invader</em> was the most intimidating of all Blacktron I vehicles. </li>
<li><em>Modularity</em>: Connecting cockpit and tail creates a useful smaller flyer that doesn't look bad at all. And of course one can combine parts of the <em>Invader</em> with the <em>Battrax</em> and <em>Renegade</em> to form some really cool models.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Almost none. If&nbsp;one can be&nbsp;really picky, I would prefer that the spaceship doesn't taper so much from front to rear. It starts taller on the front and every section becomes lower, particularly the somehow undersized tail section.</li></ul>
<p>I would probably vote this set&nbsp;as the most characteristic first generation Blacktron. It makes generally a thought through impression.&nbsp;I'm glad I still have it, the only set to survive intact since my childhood years!</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-17T00:53:20.687Z","Blacktron yo!","This was big for me when I was a kid. Its got a lot of features therefore great playability.
The way it seperates is really cool,as is the robot. Everything about the Blacktron is cool,I reckon its a great set and well worth hunting down

"andy87","2008-12-01T18:08:37.64Z","Its pretty ok","First of all, the little robot that comes with this set is really neat and looks like he is mining for precious metals. The ship itself is ok looking, but a little too sleek. The minifigures never fail to amaze me. :) Blacktron is so cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2009-05-22T13:48:45.857Z","Modularity at its best","Another great Blacktron I set, with few or no flaws depending on what you like about spaceships.

The invader has a fully closed cockpit, a robot worker, a modular body, tools, and plenty of decorated parts.

Pros:
- Great minifig design
- Modular design can combine with other sets, and adds loads of playability
- Closed cockpit
- Plenty of decorated parts
- Cool wing design
- Storage compartment is cool but can be flimsy
- Robot!
- Folding wings in front and back
- Tools
- Sturdy build

Cons:
- Engine part is rather small
- Storage door is kind of flimsy at the hinge
- Robot isn't very pose-able
- Wasted space behind seat, but can easily be used for tools and accessories (so this is kind of a pro)
- the sturdy build can sometimes be too sturdy and interfere with pulling off modular components.
-Hard to get back wings in line with one another.

Overall a well built star fighter that looks sleek and is loads of fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SharpFranc","2011-06-19T18:34:18.837Z","One of the two best middle size space ships.","<p>So you heard it 1000 times that blacktrons rule? Sorry... I will have to repeat it. Blacktrons rules! This set price was set in Poland to 14$ - yes! For this money i was able to buy this cool set. </p><p>Why it is so cool? <br>So when i bought it i was still impressed by the Aliens movie and this really recalled the dropship from that movie. The best thing about it is color scheme. It is hard to believe but when you keep it in your hand your smile to yourself. How long and why so long lego was wating to reveal sets with this color scheme. This scheme makes these sets look real. <br>Not a colorful c**p like you can see recently. Black... with some small yellow/red and trunslucent parts. That's it!</p><p><br>Now from the playability perspective. When i saw it for the first time in the lego book i didnt realize it consists of three parts.<br>So when i entered a shop and took the box my jaw fallen down... I had to buy it!<br>Playability of this set is simply incredible or you can say i am not demanding person. <br>Many movables, robot in the middle part and these four red translucent parts. You can stick part 1 &amp; 3 and fly away leaving part 2 with robot on their own.<br></p><p>To be honest if you have this set you better have other blacktrons. Then you will really know why people say blacktrons rules. You can mix ship-parts from different sets!<br>Maybe i am wrong but this is the only series that is capable of such thing!<br>One might say that this set doesnt contain any special bricks, blah blah blah. Honestly - i don't care. It is simply one of the coolest ships in this size. <br>The only competitor to me is mtron particle ionizer :)<br>I really recommend this set - a must have!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"PA4KEV","2022-01-28T20:22:59.33Z","A ship for a Bounty Hunter","<p>I was looking for a ship for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71025-11/Galactic-Bounty-Hunter"" target=""_blank"">Galactic Bounty Hunter</a> minifigure and the Blacktron 1 Invader was the right one to pick. As a kid, I never had any Blacktron 1 sets, but their colour scheme and minifigures look awesome to me!</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>As an adult who had LEGO as a child, the building of this set was very satisfying to do. Modern sets usually have specially created parts to create its look. But when you put the bricks and plates together for the Invader, it just feels you are building a robust spaceship.</p>

<h2>Parts &amp; Playability</h2>

<p>For a set from 1987, this is a very modular set. You can appreciate how LEGO designed their sets in the 80&#39;s to create a modular, robust and sleek look with the limited pieces LEGO used back then. Still, the rectangular brick shape may throw off some LEGO fans because it may look a bit boring for today&#39;s standards.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Front of the ship</h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The trans-yellow canopy can open, but it is attached to a hinged roof that opens an area behind the cockpit. Ideal to put the Bounty Hunter&#39;s <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=24093pb025&amp;idColor=17#T=C&amp;C=17"">trans-red wanted tablet</a> and the <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=95199&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">pistol</a>. Inside is a <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3039p33&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">sloped brick with a yellow computer with buttons</a>, a real nostalgic thing to see, when computers with many lights and buttons looked important. The black wedges on the sides have 2 hinges each, that can create a different dynamic to the ship. It has two cannons on the front, with <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3957&amp;idColor=17#T=C&amp;C=17"">trans-red rods</a>. Finally, the nose is a <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=4858p01&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">wedge with the Blacktron 1 logo</a> on it, very useful for MOCs.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Middle Cargo area</h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This area houses the <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sp078/blacktron-droid"">little droid</a> that comes with this set. Inside are a <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=4522&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">black mallet</a> and <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=4006&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">black wrench</a>, ideal for fixing high-tech space equipment! It has <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2345p44&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">two corner walls with the Blacktron 1 logo</a> on it, which are unique to this set. The cargo area can detach from the front of the ship and the rear engine part.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Rear part with fins</h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The rear of the ship is interesting with its <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2419&amp;idColor=17#T=C&amp;C=17"">trans-red fins</a>, which do not appear often in other LEGO sets. These fins kind of create the menacing, alien part of this ship. This part of the ship can directly connect to the front of the ship, to create a smaller ship without the cargo area.</p>

<h2>Value for money</h2>

<p>I paid &euro;<font face=""Tahoma,Arial"">49.50 for this set in 2022. To me, that was worth it, but would be way too expensive for this set nowadays if it were new. In 1987, it was sold for a price of </font>&euro;10 to &euro;15. Which shows, inflation included, how this set has hold a good price. You can try piecing the set together yourself, because it has many common parts. In the end, this set is worth its current price.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I really like this ship, it will be the base of a MOC that I will make for a unique Blacktron 1 ship that my Bounty Hunter will fly around in to scour the Galaxy. Nostalgia makes this a great set nowadays for adult LEGO fans!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
