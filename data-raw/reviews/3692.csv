The prison pod and figures are very decent though and redeem this set.  I got this set as part of a space police collection and it's only really worth getting this one to complete it.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T01:26:31Z","The steering is still cool","And the prison pod which is interchangable with all the other Space Police sets from that year is nice...but yeah, wasn't always my favorite, though having that at the Galactic Peace Keeper was always nifty.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-28T14:12:37Z","Cool steering","  I wasn't very impressed with this set before I built it, but I like better now it's built. It has the coolest steering.  When you press the 'POLICE' brick, it turns!  Still, the cocpit is very small and open.  The driver's legs are hanging out.  Something else that surprised me, though, where the wheels.  Aren't these the same as those from the Mega-Core Magnetizer?  They're a lot bigger than in the picture. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-17T23:02:30.07Z","Arresting set","This was the first Space Police set I owned, and I just loved the little prison pod with its 'laser' bars.  The ability to steer the vehicle is great and well-designed as well.  The Space Police 1 was the first range to include those extended cockpits, as well as those chunky wheels.  This vehicle looks as though it could be on its way to a Monster Truck Rally!  Nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"davidazevedo","2006-02-06T11:06:31Z","Good","This was one of my first space sets. I broke my arm in several places when I was 10 and the only way to keep me in the bedroom was giving me legos. It was the first time I saw an axle. I was actually gonna throw it out untill I realised it was needed in the construction. I still have the BIG wheels somewhere.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-05-18T22:04:07.197Z","Nice steering mechanism.","The Spy-Trak I is a good Space Police set with one Space Police officer and one Blacktron outlaw.

The way the vehicle is steered by pressing on one of the 'POLICE' slopes in the middle of the vehicle is ingenious and fun. It's a little feature that greatly increases playability.

On the back is a Space Police prison pod to keep the Blacktron prisoner. The pod can detach and can fit on other Space Police sets.

My one complaint with this set is the cockpit. The bottom of the cockpit is not covered, and so the pilot's legs are exposed to the elements. This adds a small feeling of emptiness to the set.

Nevertheless, this is a good set worth around 20$ to me. Space fans shouldn't hesitate to pick one up for such a price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-09-06T15:16:24.45Z","Personal favorite","This is my favorite set out of the whole Space Police 1 line. The design is sturdy, the steering is innovative, and it just plain looks cool. What's not to love?

PROS:

- Awesome steering mechanic. The midsection can be tilted left or right to move both sets of wheels. And it works! O:

- Two figs.

- Sturdy construction.

- Great look. 

- Cheap.

CONS:

- Gappy cockpit... but then, it's not a space vehicle. 


I was very happy with this set. Highly recommended! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-07-29T15:43:02.69Z","5/5 classic","this set is definetely a cool space set.  i love the whole space police 1 series but this one is one of my favorite.  the steering mechanism is really cool and unique to the set.  the windsheild is also really cool and great for custom made sets.  the figures are also one of a kind.  the capsule is also neat the way it slides onto the back of the vehicle.  the black wheels are neat too.  no cons about this set.  i greatly advise the purchasing of this set.  i'm sure glad i did.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-13T18:13:34.793Z","One of the Best Out of All Space Police sets","From Space Police 1 to Space Police 3 sets, there are only a few great sets from that theme. This is one of them. I really like the design of this set. The wheels are cool, the jail cell that comes with it is pretty awesome and has printed elements. This set probably is one of the best Space Police sets ever made.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-20T16:55:54.61Z","Awesome! Atrue ground vehicle, redefining space sets","This set is unique, and it isn't a legend... yet... (I think the Legends series is also discontinued, ha ha). The steering is unique, since it actually works, and allows for smooth turning. The capsule slides into the back and has a futuristic jail cell feel, but the fatal flaw with both Space Police series is that there was never a mass-storage facility for the containers, a REAL base would be nice (unlike the small outpost for one man in SP 1). This set has only one flaw, and that is that the cockpit is incopmlete, but the lightweight frame has a style of its own. Tools included, a great set (and no stickers, YAY!!)

P.S. I've noticed that, although it was never marked in any parts catalog, older space wheels that were large or giant size had an inside frame of four bars in the newer wheels, especially those in SP II's solar snooper. (A common misunderstanding like the radar dish thing)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"The_Mad_Vulcan","2014-01-02T13:24:15.997Z","Great Set With Interesting Parts for the Creative Builder Type","This could be the best/most nostalgic set that I received as a child. It really stands out because these parts became the mainstay for future builds. After getting this, my brother and I built sets in particular around these parts (for years), just adding new sets to these.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>In particular; the giant wheels, the cockpit, the window (on the jail cell), the swivel pivots, and the laser coloured pieces are great additions to any block pool. The colour scheme of blue and black is interesting and easy to get parts to match.</div><div><br></div><div>The set itself is one of the few that I built, kept built, and played with for more than a day. What's more, it is designed to work well with and interact with the other Space Police 1 sets (which I still need to fully collect).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One flaw is that the set itself seems slightly incomplete. That is, it seems like the original build was even better and that a restriction on piece count (to match the price point) caused it to be slightly simplified. Compare the nose of this to 6886 - Galactic Peace Keeper and 6781 - SP-Striker, which have the same cockpit, and you can see that what is missing is a black boat hull piece which would go under the cockpit and close it up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'll see if I can't link pics of this set + pics of the set fixed with minimal pieces.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"GemaskerdeMuchacho","2020-04-09T20:09:34.15Z","Stunning build and interesting technique","<p>I&#39;ve build all my sets and i iave to say, this is at the top 10.</p>

<p>The build is good, but it is mostly the mind blowing technique how the wheels turn opposite to each other..&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can turn this vehicle with the mibble part and this works so good!</p>

<p>Those wheels feel like a Hot Wheel, what is s very good thing. These are my biggest wheels.. Perfect!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also lots of fun with the small prison at the rear. And those colors are stunning!</p>
