I used to think it was a little ugly but i bought a couple and now i just love this set.  The crane in the back is a really cool mechanismand the steering is just like the mega core's just a smaller version.  The pilots cocpit is really coll with the dual control panels conected to the m-tron logo nose cone.  For anyone who owns or is getting this set i would also suggest trying to take off the crane and parts around it and leave the fence.  It then makes like a space troop transport for like 4 guys maybe.  overall another great m-tron set.  buy it or you're missing something big.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T01:26:04.39Z","Big wheels roll over hostile planets","I got this set at a yard sale with a few others from the late 80's and really like it. The vehicle is hinged in the middle so it turns or corners with a unique style. The wheels are big, but not near as big as the 6 wheeled vehicle from the same theme. The size of the &quot;car&quot; is out of proportion to most of my other space themed sets. Still a good set, one I was happy to stumble across.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"M_Tron_Hero_Kodiak","2008-12-23T00:27:01.437Z","Forageing for more fun with this one","The Celestial Forager is a great space/M-Tron set.
I recieved this set for xmas along with the Six wheeler and a few others one year.
A good little set to get if you can find it.


A Crew of one is all this little four wheeler gets.
For Movement: Wheeled.  Fast.  Needs to be in order to escape any Blacktron while out looking for green nemotodes (green rounds)
Maneuverbility: The Split chassis is excellent for turning, and allows it to move the same radius backward or forward.
Armor: Lightly armored, Driver completely exposed.
Weapons: No weapons in site.  I could assume that the right driving arm could be one if taken off?
Firecontrol, sensors, communication: Only what I see on the driving controls. 4 Buttons and 1 Screen.  Not to mention radio.  The dishes in the back I am sure are for sensor and communication.

Any kid would have a fun time with this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"nateholio","2009-08-10T13:01:09.263Z","Simple Set With a Ton of Uses","This set was my first M-Tron set, and is outstanding. I remember being amazed as a kid with the magnets and turning mechanism.

This set fits in well with the rest of the M-Tron line, using its ""bed"" to ferry miners between the Mega Core Magnetizer/Stellar Recon Voyager and far flung mining sites. With that said, the centerpiece of this set is the tow arm, as silly as it sounds. The tow arm can also be used to carry the small lockboxes like the set came with, or the larger equipment pallets of other M-Tron sets between larger vehicles and the same remote mining sites. Another use for the tow arm is to retrieve stuck vehicles or carry smaller vehicles to remote sites.

Pros:
-Cool turning mechanism
-Useful tow arm in the ""bed""
-Unique controls for the driver
-Plenty of ground clearance

Cons:
-Being called a ""forager"", I'd assume it would have at least one piece of mining equipment",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"T79","2014-11-24T13:33:32.317Z","A worthy successor to #6885 Crater Crawler","<p>This M-Tron version of a hinged ground vehicle is really a lot nicer than the earlier Futuron set (well, except for not having a&nbsp;small drone) although just by having those bulky plastic space wheels every comparison is a bit unfair. It also was part of what seemed a trend back then where several space sets included a gimmicky feature&nbsp;that took up too much space for its own good, perhaps epitomized in #6986 Mission Commander where a large part of the ship was used just to lift the cockpit.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Neither of them are still in my possession but luckily they can be found online. Again the standard sandy moon-like ground surface as background, it does not detract and the finished vehicle looks quite nice on it too. Fourteen steps with several sub builds for about 90 pieces seems about standard for the time.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are certainly some nice parts here: a round 6 x 6 radar dish, two black 1 x 8 x 2 fences, some trans-green parts, lots of plates etc. but above all four magnets! For a set this small this is quite a lot, at least it&#39;s our smallest set with more than two magnets. The&nbsp;medium plastic wheels are probably a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; item, I&#39;m not too fond of the look and feel but they sure make your vehicle&nbsp;appear big(ger) and&nbsp;in this case they actually work rather well. The main reason to dock some points&nbsp;in this category&nbsp;is rather the tiny mailbox used as cargo here. Not that it is a bad part, far from it, but a bigger cargo item&nbsp;looks so much&nbsp;better: that huge tow arm for a tiny box? Really?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One standard MagneTron (couldn&#39;t resist, really) astronaut. It&#39;s a small set so one is enough. Back in the days individuality was not something that was valued highly in legoland, on the flip side this certainly&nbsp;made it&nbsp;easy to have a completely uniform faction. In this case he comes with a radio and two space chainsaw body parts for the controls.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a rather nice build for such a small model, the turning mechanism especially is ingenious and works really well. Also the way the controls are created by using some printed tiles on those sideways connected space chainsaw body parts&nbsp;looks good, and at least is a step up from the single lever used in #6885.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks suitably industrial and can be used in a plethora of functions while playing:&nbsp;to tow damaged vehicles (if you have #6989 Mega Core Magnetizer one of those small onboard craft is a prime candidate, if not attaching a magnet to #6811 Pulsar Charger works too) or heavy loads (again, using bigger cargo items from other sets in stead of the tiny box included here), or you could remove the tow arm and use it as a space pickup truck with cargo boxes or astronauts in the back. The only downside here is the tow arm which takes up the entire rear half of the vehicle and is only used to carry a small box, it looks a bit incongruous. As mentioned before this&nbsp;sort of play feature&nbsp;seems to be something that was included in several space sets of the time, taking up too much space for what it actually does.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, a nice little vehicle that works as an industrial multi-purpose carrier (although <em>foraging</em> only works if you have another vehicle to extract the minerals, all this one can really do is ferry them around). And some bigger containers are easy to do, we usually built a copy or two of the container from #6923 Particle Ioniser as that one does not use too many special parts and looks suitably heavy and bulky for the tow arm here.</p>

"Uspez","2020-03-01T17:23:47.23Z","Give it a roll!","<p>I had this set as a kid and haven&#39;t had it built in a very long time and&nbsp;just recently built it to hopefully keep it all together for a while.&nbsp; I&#39;d say that even without nostalgia being involved that this set is perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asthetically the Celestial Forager looks great in person with nice details all around.</p>

<p>The main draw of the set are the play features.&nbsp; What you do is grab the 2x2 round brick in the middle and then you have total control of maneuvring&nbsp;the Celestial Forager every which way very easily.&nbsp; This play feature is totally satisfying and fun.&nbsp; It would already be great even without the magnet features but those are definitely&nbsp;nice.&nbsp; If you want a great meduim size rover to add to your LEGO SPACE collection then this would be the perfect choice.</p>

<p>Interesting side note: according to the description of M-Tron in my little LEGO catalog, they locate and transport vital resources and those must the&nbsp;1x1 round trans-neon green pieces that go in the box.&nbsp; My other M-Tron set also has those in the box.</p>
