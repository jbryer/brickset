"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-19T00:00:00Z","","As far as I'm concerned this is just about the best medium sized ship Lego came out with. It is definatly one of the best looking spaceships. The model looks like the ideal pursuit and patrol craft The hunter looks fast and powerful. The way the ship folds when the prison cell has been ejected is totally unique. Mini figs from two different themes is also a nice touch. My only complaint is for a warship it could do with a little more weaponry besides those guns mounted at the front. I don't know why people consider SP1 to be better than this, I mean where are the engines on those ships? This is and always will be one of the best Lego spaceships.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-11T00:37:11Z","Very good medium sized spaceship","I've never liked medium sized spaceships much, but this one is pretty good.  I love how it's yet another Space Police set with a Prison Pod.  There must be a lot of captured Blacktron figures somewhere! 

I just love the support pieces in this set, and the spaceship is quite sleek.  On the down side, the parts are still juniorised when compared to earlier space models, and when you take the prison pod away the set looks a bit flimsy.  I loved this set at first, but I've somewhat grown out of it in preference of bigger spaceships. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"StormSworder","2007-04-21T02:10:45.617Z","Interesting design","When compared to the original Space Police line, Space Police 2 don't hold a candle, either in terms of colours or design.  Taken on their own, however, Space Police 2 are great sets.  This one, for example, is a spacecraft designed for transporting a prison pod.  The mid-section opens up, either to collect prison pods or drop them - in lava or ice flows, presumably.  It's also good to see grey bricks and green windows returning to the Space line.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2009-01-06T19:06:26.95Z","An excellent Space Police II sampler. ","This is my first Space Police II set, and now I want to get the others. The sleekness and design is great, with a high swoosh factor and a well realized shape. It a good size for the piece count, too, and it includes two minifigs.

I notable feature of the set is the shape-shifting prison cell release element. It's every bit as weird as it sounds. The outer walls of the ship's midsection move outwards to release the cell, collapsing the back half and creating a much smaller ship. It's a neat idea and I like the innovation, but the ship is a little weird looking when it's collapsed. Also, the prison cell will also tend to unlock itself in a bid for freedom if you fly it around holding it somewhere besides the midsection. But it's not a big deal since you will almost always hold it by the midsection.

It should be noted that, while LEGO tries to pass this off as a stunt fighter, it's really more of a prison transport barge. It's swooshable enough to play like a fighter, but in terms of aesthetics it looks like it was designed with something else in mind. 

I wouldn't pay an outrageous amount of money to get this MISB, but used it's a great addition to any Space fan's collection. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-16T19:47:29.753Z","4/5 pretty cool yet a little juniorized","    Not a bad set for the most part.  The space police 2 series is dwarfed in coolness to the first series, but this set is pretty cool.  The prison pod holding mechanism is what saved it from getting a 2/5.  The cockpit and tail sections come closer together, folding out the sides releasing the pod.  The mechanism works really well and  is why i love this set so much.  The space police 2 figure is great and you can never get enough blacktron 2 minifigures.  I also like how the four boosters are made up of support stanchions.  Overall, it isn't that bad of a set and is definetely worth a shot at getting it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-07-22T17:30:50.95Z","Awesome SPII set","This is one of my favorite space ships, and it is obvious to see why. If you compare this to SP I, it probably isn't as good (or expensive) but this doesn't have a 9V battery pack, lights, a light up CPU monitor, and the awesome laser bar effect, but this is still a 5/5 ship no matter what.

This ship does have two figures, a bad guy (blacktron) and a good guy (space police), which in terms of any set is the most ideal condition, gi&#180;ving you a taste of each! The cockpit is really cool and if you look at the computer monitor you can actually tell the ship on-screen is the ship itself. The back of the ship has an accordion like hinge system, allowing it to fold and unfold to grab and release the cargo: the signature space police jail cell, with a panel at the bottom just sized to hold the figure's feet. This cell, however, is more roomy compared to the SP I's tiny cell. The coolest part to the set is, in my opinion, the wings. The wings are awesome with each one being a stanchion support with a booster at the end. If you want these are the perfect foundations for a base!


The cons to this set are that
- the cell sometimes falls out (lucky break for the prisoner)
- the cockpit has a hole at the back.
- and lastly, the very back is bare, a bracket under the tailfin with a booster or cone would have fixed that though.

Find one if you can get a good deal, no more than $20 used, though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-10T13:32:29.217Z","Not the Best Designed Mid-sized Ship","Having collected nearly all the space Lego sets sold in America, naturally I would buy something like this.  However, compared to many of the other mid-sized ships up to this point, this set feels slightly lacking development.  The main feature (outside of the integration of colors and the feeling into the Space Police 2 theme) is that you can use hinges to house the prison.  It's a very daring concept because the bulging hinge part keeps the prison piece &quot;locked&quot; in, under the arch section.  However, I found using hinges for more than opening compartments or castle sections to be a bit iffy. Sometimes, hinges would come loose and that could potentially make the prison a bit flaky in terms of being secured.

Also, a few axle pieces are employed to allow the rear section to move forward when the prison isn't secured.  It's not really pretty and is a very bizarre way to do something like this.  I guess it works out in the end and is very unconventional, which makes the design here unique and something a person like myself would never think about (for numerous reasons, including practical and aesthetic).  But I suppose for unique playability reasons, it's an interesting concept.

Besides that, the ship itself really is nothing.  With the prison attached, the ship looks cool but really there's nothing special outside of it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Batmaniam","2009-03-25T14:01:22.903Z","Deploy The Escape Pod!","This an awesome set! I love it. My brother was bif into Lego, when he was a kid, so he got lots of Lego, so this set was his, but he left so now it is mine. Okay onto the reveiw:
The minifigs: 
Two of them, only one can fit in the nose though, th other one has to go into the escape capsule. Look at the picture above.
The Ship:
Very nice fighter ship, lots of swooshability, if you push the back in, the escape Pod falls out. Lots of nice pieces.
The Escape Pod:
Just a little thing that a minifig can fit in. With a little bit of modifaction you can make this into a bomber.

Very nice set. Can't wait for Space Police 3!

"mstratton28","2014-02-12T23:02:46.043Z","A great mid-size ship.","<p>I received this set back when it was new from my godmother. I no longer have the box and the instructions might be around here somewhere. I recently re-built this set from scanned instructions on the web. They are pretty straight forward and it was a fun build (again).</p>

<p>The set has a good variety of parts in either gray, black or red colors. A few pieces like the green canopy and the pilots&#39; controls were the only time I saw a part in that color/design. A few parts have the &quot;Space Police&quot; logo but none were applied with stickers. My only complain is the lack of a steering input. How did the guy fly the ship? Did he push buttons on the control pannel? Did he fly with his mind?</p>

<p>I know it is a small gripe, but my younger self was always confused with that tiny detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set came with two minifigures. One is a standard Space Police 2 figure and the other is a standard Blacktron 2 figure perfect for&nbsp;sci-fi Cops n&#39; Robbers.</p>

<p>Overall I liked the set when I received it. Most of the space sets had a canopy that opened and closed and different parts that moved, but none of the space ships that I had would completely fold in half. I though this was a creative design, however it was a shame that this was my only Space Police set.</p>

"Faefrost","2014-07-28T21:02:50.513Z","Sleek and Distinctive","<p>A recent E-Bay addition to my Space collection. The smaller Space Police 2 Rebel Hunter. First up this is one of the more awesomely named sets in the SP2 line. That dart board random naming selector nailed it this time.</p>

<p>The set is in a word sleek. The front is the standard SP2 trans green, grey black and red trimmed down to a distinctive nose. The flaring green corner pieces behind the pilot actually look good on this one comparred with teh awkwardness of them on the Solar Snooper and Galactic Mediator. The rest of the design is oddly yet pleasantly symmetrical&nbsp;with the 4 wings mirrored not just side to side put front to back. Giving it a stylish yet solid utilitarian feel. This feels like a ship that means business. It was built under government contract to do a job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most distinctive feature of the set, in fact the only play feature besides opening the canopy, is the way the ship accordian folds in the mid section to pick up and secure the standard SP2 style Prisoner Pod. Building it is a bit finicky in this area and can cause some frustration until it is all locked in place. However thanks to the three technic axles that form the three bars across the top of the ship the folding on this baby is rock solid. Those three bars act as rails to support everything while it is in transition. Otherwise, as seen on the little Flyer in the Solar Snooper this mechanism can be flimsy and frustrating.</p>

<p>Play features with this thing&nbsp;are literally all about the swooshing. You swoosh the ship, pick the prisoner up, swoosh the ship drop the prisoner off, repeat endlessly. But in its defense it is a really good swooshable ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are 1 standard Space Police 2 Officer and one typical Blacktron&nbsp;2. Both refugees from their lines most garish era&#39;s. (why oh why did Blacktron trade their awesome black outfits for what look like hockey jerseys? ) And the Space Police outfit looks like is shares a stylist and fashion designer with Elton John... from the early years.</p>

<p>Overall a very solid and desirable set. Not to the level of shear awesome of the Mediator or Solar Snooper. But it hits everything right. This would have been a fantastic must have set while still new on store shelves hitting that perfect value point. These days its worth picking up aftermarket if you can find one and collect such things. It displays well. Swooshes well and doesn&#39;t take up an insane amount fo shelf space. Plus you can never have enough trans green</p>
