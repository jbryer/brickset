"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-20T19:46:36Z","High playability factor","Despite not being terribly big this model certainly packs in the features. A full ski and ice saw set, a satellite and the rocket to launch it - and a radio aerial thing to keep track of it, some surreal tools, a crane to lift the rocket into place and a tilting platform to position it for launch, it really supplies everything you need to launch a satellite from wherever you want (speaking of which, what's with all the missile talk? You people are weapon obsessed!). It looks neat too, I love the cockpit slung low in front of the wheels, especially since it offers more cover than most Ice Planet vehicles and has a good number of control panels to account for all the functions. It has a couple of slight flaws though, primarily that the rocket doesn't actually quite fit in the lowered position, only by a small amount, but that makes it all the more annoying! Also... the crane is kind of pointless, not actually having the strength to lift or hold the rocket, it's only a cosmetic thing really - a good cosmetic thing, but nothing more. Also, a steering mechanism would have been nice, but hey, it's a relatively small set. Very close to getting a 10, and well worth getting, especially since they're not too pricey.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-03T14:37:27.363Z","5/5 great from all perspectives","   This LEGO space set is one of my favorite ice planet sets and is great with the color scheme.  The playability of this set is so high it's almost ridiculus.  The overall peice count and how they are used is phenominal. The set has its own crane, satalite, rocket, a cool figure, and lots of accesories like a blue chainsaw, a light, and some weird tool that i'm not sure what it's used for.  The coolest feature that i like about this set is the back part that holds the rocket.  It can do a 90 degree turn backwards and the rocket is then facing upwards.  You can then launch it from the back.  The crane on top is also very usefull due to its design and placement.  The peices, the figure, the rocket, the everything.  THe set just gets cooler and cooler the longer you look at it.  I would highly advise you to get this set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2009-01-13T23:15:57.343Z","Great little vehicle","I got this set off of ebay for a reasonable price, and I wasn't disappointed at all. The aesthetics are very nice- it looks pretty good when the rocket is stored in the docking bay with the crane attached to it.

However when you move the crane you find that the joints aren't even capable of supporting their own weight, much less that of the rocket. I realize they didn't have a preferred alternative at the time, though. 

Despite this it has some things going for it; the cockpit snaps into place, the eight-wheel drive is cool, and the aesthetics are great! 

All in all this is a nifty set and any Ice Planet fan should snatch it up, since it's one of the best in the theme (though not THE best). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-03T16:40:40.787Z","Ohhhh! Orange!","This set is awesome! The orange, blue and white color scheme makes it very attractive! The rocket is awesome. It can turn 90 degress and be lifted up to &quot;Launch&quot; the rocket. It doesn't look bad for an eight wheeler! I love how it comes with magnets! There so rare now-a-days. The minigfig is awesome! I love the orange visor. The saw is good! This set sure packs a punch for the price! I highly recamend it!

"Captain","2008-09-26T18:36:07.733Z","An awesome vintage set with a sweet color scheme!","Ice planet is one of my favorite themes, and this set is awesome. Essentially it's an 8-wheeled truck with equipment on the back for launching giant rockets. Although I believe the rockets are meant to be satellites or something like that, it's always more fun to pretend that they're nukes. The colors consist of white, blue, and trans-orange, with a bit of black thrown in. The set has a decent build with nice parts and an awesome minifig. With lots of hinges and moving parts, there's plenty of playability to this set as well. The back tilts to point the rocket straight up for launch. Besides that, there are several tools that clip on the sides for the guy to use.

Overall, this set is great, a classic that is worth tracking down.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's got a lot of great features-it's also the third largest Ice Planet 2002 set. For a space vehicle, it's pretty good. The best feature is the rocket launcher. The magnetic arm attached to the rocket and has a good range of motion. The trans neon orange parts holding the rocket are great keep it in place. There is also a satellite to attach to the top (sputnik?). The front is decent, but it's got a great design. The only annoying thing about this is the skis attach to a part and can be difficult to take off, but that's no big deal compared to the rest of the set.</p><h4>Building</h4><p>Not much to say-not really any techniques of interests, although it's pretty fun.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Lots of blue, white and trans neon orange (great colors)-the crane arm parts, the windshield, the rocket base, the wheels, and the minifigure accessories are all great.</p><h4>Playability</h4><p>Very playable.Overall:</p><p><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Barely any issues</li><li>Great colors</li><li>Good land vehicle for a space theme (the only ones I prefer at the Spy-Trak I and the Mega Core Magnetizer)</li><li>Great parts</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4></p><p><ul><li>Trouble with opening and closing cockpit</li><li>Trouble taking snowshoes on and off the rack.</li></ul><div>I recommend this set to any and every Space fan.

"James83","2017-08-18T16:09:43.373Z","Launch Yourself Some Fun!","<p>This rocket launching vehicle is the largest Ice Planet ground vehicle and is an imposing and fun vehicle and essential for any Ice Planet research mission.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>This eight-wheeled vehicle is a rocket transporter-launcher. With over a 130 parts it is a reasonably satisfying build and takes some time to fully assemble. The basic chassis is all in one piece and is fairly stable despite being quite high when fully assembled. The cockpit is spacious and has a large opening neon orange windscreen and is flanked by orange headlights. The driver has a steering wheel and two printed Ice Planet computer bricks on either side to control the vehicle and the rocket, there is really no need for him to leave the cab to set up the rocket launch. Behind the cab is the magnetic crane. It sits on a lower section that has several clips and hooks for skis, icesaw&nbsp;and another tool and an elevating radio antenna (which is quite flimsy). The retro-looking satellite also clips the side of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crane itself looks fragile but actually is quite robust and has a magnet which holds the rocket securely and can place it onto the ground. The rocket sits securely on an elevating mechanism, held in place by the two neon orange panels at the rear that open. The only design flaw is that even elevated to 90 degrees, the rocket cannot rest on the ground and will fall out, unless the crane is used to help it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Ice Planet figure with printed male head with white hair, helmet with snow visor and airtanks. He comes equipped with an icesaw, neon orange skis and another odd neon orange cone tool to prepare the launching site.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>There was not much else to add to this set and it gave many happy hours of rocket launches. I did build a couple of different rockets for the vehicle though to give some variety and you can make different satellites too. Overall a highly&nbsp;versaitle and playable set.&nbsp;</p>
