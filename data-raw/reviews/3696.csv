The antennae on the top could easily turn the spinning top section into a neat little gun turret.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-15T17:07:05.69Z","5/5 best 15 dollar set available","    Not a bad set at all.  It has the figures and tools to man the whole base.  The set has a lot of great peices.  I think you could build this into anything.  The two exploriens figures are great.  The only thing that I really don't like about this set is that the base doesn't have many places to put the figures.  The way it has the booster engines on the bottom is cool which suggests the possibility of flight in this set.  The top come off also, but i don't feel that it was a good mechanism to the set. Overall, this set is worth purchasing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-20T17:28:52.39Z","Nice little base.","There weren't that many small-ish bases in Lego Space, which seems a shame, but this one is a great set.  The top half detaches, there are nice opening walls and hatches, and there are plenty of interesting little features such as the blue/red thing for viewing those holograms.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-10T17:23:10.61Z","awesome hologram","i really liked the piece with the sticker on the bottom because the sticker was like a hologram with the guys head and the satellite. also i think the lenses are cool when you move the piece with the dinosaur really fast under them it looks like its biting the bone. the figures are cool even though there practilly the same. all the wind shields and all the pieces are awesome. the discs on the bottom tend to fall off though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aqualize","2010-01-07T07:33:28Z","Nice with small space station but fragile","Pros:
I like the coziness of such a little outpost. The turnable guns (or telescope?) and other things are cool. A lot can be moved on it.

Cons:
It is way to fragile to be a quality product from Lego.
The black pieces underneath falls off and the two foldable white support frames falls off.

Good for display but not so fun to play with as one need to be very careful with it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"clundsberg","2011-07-10T16:32:47.22Z","If an outpost falls over in space, can you hear me scream?","<p>This is a perfect example of a great concept but unstable design.&nbsp; For example, the building experience is fun by when you look at it, but frustrating when pieces fall off with the addition of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving oneself a nice flat, non-wobbly surface to work with helps, but even then sometimes the slightest of pressure will pop a piece off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts in this set are pretty great.&nbsp; A basic black &amp; white structure&nbsp;(no literally, the base is black and white)&nbsp;complimented with non-brick shaped ""uniques"" with flourescent yellow and blues.&nbsp; Some nifty hologram stickers (my fav part) add to the world of LEGO making this piece seem that much more realistic.&nbsp; The 2 figures in this set are very cool looking with their different helmets and detailed Explorien space-suits, however, the faces are the same and the figures seem to be&nbsp;identicle to&nbsp;other Explorien minis, so either these two scientists are very, VERY busy or there's been some cloning done in the Explorien faction.&nbsp; This can be pro or con depending on your preference with minis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability is (again) technically great. Lots of different functions: red/blue sticker decoder, hologram stickers, magnetic stickers, detachable tools, 2 minis, top of base detaches from bottom, flip up panels/windows for ease of access, etc. but (sigh) AGAIN, this is only fun providing some of the structure doesn't disintigrate in ones hands.&nbsp; I blame LEGO space rust :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion: Fire - Bad, Tree - Pretty, Nebula Outpost - Unstable.&nbsp; I'd have given this an average of 3 which is...er...average, however this is a very cool looking outpost.&nbsp; The heart was there when they designed it.&nbsp; Best use - on Display.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-27T10:16:56.837Z","LEGO Space (Exploriens) - Nebula Outpost Review","This outpost is a very cool set from the LEGO Space (Exploriens) theme. It has lot's of great play features like a sviwel screen which has a shiny sticker, opening walls, opening windows, a laser cannon and two translucent yellow antennas on the top which sviwel. We also get two plates with a sticker which you can put under a translucent red and blue piece and then the picture on it will be different which is really awsome. The top does sviwel as well and I love the design of that model. I also like the set for the two minifigs. The built of this base is cool and easy. This model is very sturdy, too. I really can't complain much about this set. As I told you: It's lot's of fun!<br><br>All

"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-24T15:17:15.763Z","Outer space outpost","<div>I always wonder what it’s like being a person assigned to a remote research station, whether that research station may be in the frozen wastes of Antarctica or perhaps in the Himalayas somewhere, and I’m sure that none of those could possibly compare to life on a space station or perhaps on some sort of base somewhere in outer space, where human contact could be limited to nothing but radio or email for something for months or years at a time. Actually, I think I might kind of enjoy that.</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, none of this is of any concern to LEGO Minifigs, who have conquered the furthest reaches of the globe and far beyond it. Although it’s relatively common for Space cultures to establish a major base to support its various vehicles and spacecraft, smaller outposts such as this one are pretty rare, which makes the Exploriens pretty unique in this regard. With its <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=UFO"">UFO</a>-like radial symmetry and two Minifigs to keep each other company on whatever desolate rock they’ve been assigned to, Nebula Outpost is a fine addition to any Exploriens research fleet.</div><div><br></div><div>The Exploriens were a pretty feature-heavy subtheme of Space (perhaps at the slight expense of aesthetics), and there’s a lot of cool stuff to do with Nebula Outpost. Two Minifigs is pretty generous, since there’s really only space inside the outpost for one, so I guess one has to man the tower while the other goes out looking for those weird fossil things that the Exploriens seem so interested in. The standard transparent red and blue pieces for “filtering” the fossil things that are standard equipment for the Exploriens are, of course, present, along with an excellent hologram sticker that is really among the only use of stickers in LEGO history that actually vindicates their use.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the top of the outpost sits a turning and detachable lab that houses a star chart - another cool sticker from the Exploriens era - as well as a piece of equipment that I suppose must be a receiver or transmitter of some kind, but, to my pre-adolescent self, I was perfectly fine with interpreting it as some sort of laser cannon to destroy hapless foes. Your choice. The transparent blue “windows” that fold over the lab are attractive as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Space purists will probably note that the Nebula Outpost is completely exposed to every danger that hostile outer space territory has to offer, and some stuffy grown-up collectors may knock it down a few points for that reason. This nuance never really occurred to me as a kid, so I never had a problem with it, and really, the whole point of its openness is to facilitate playability. Less forgivable is its slightly flimsy construction that doesn’t inspire confidence if one is living in a dangerous environment. I don’t have much to offer by way of justification on that point except perhaps for OMG HOLOGRAM STICKER</div><div><br></div><div>I wasn’t particularly enthralled by the Exploriens at the time, but Nebula Outpost has always stood out as a particularly memorable set to me. Every fledgling space colony could use something like this, and you probably couldn’t ask for a better place to start if you’re getting going with the Exploriens line; this together with the Hovertron (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6815-1"">6815</a>) makes for a pretty sweet starter base.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"AlHazred","2011-08-24T11:20:08.493Z","A Lonely Watchtower At The Edge Of Space","<p>Space is mostly empty, a vast wasteland speckled with stellar phenomena. One of the types of stellar phenomena of interest to scientists is the nebula, a large collection of gas and dust. It is thought that nebulae grow over time; as more gas and dust collects in the same volume of space, the gravitational pull of the nebula increases until eventually it gets large enough that the mass forms a new star system.</p><p>Needless to say, nebulae are all located pretty far away from Earth. So I always pictured the Nebula Outpost as one of the most distant Exploriens facility, visited only by far-traveling scientists who visit by spacecraft, do a few days' worth of science, and then head on to their next destination.</p><p>The mental image of men and women so dedicated to knowledge that they would brave the formless depths of space to seek it out always filled me with a weird sense of awe. Of course, this is just a LEGO set, and a relatively inexpensive one at that, but even as a child I knew instinctively that such people existed. These are the real astronaut heroes.<br></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I got this without the box, and with heavily-worn instructions. Nevertheless, they are clearly marked. I love the backgrounds they used in the old Space sets, and this is no different, showing a beautiful artistic interpretation of another world.<br></p><p>This set comes from a time when the last page would show alternative builds using the same pieces. The alternatives include a striking space ship/radio-telescope and some sort of open plan mobile research station. Both look like worthy additions to the Exploriens armada.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The kit contains some unusual parts. The overall Exploriens color scheme of white, black, and trans-blue offers a lot of opportunity to create classic-looking spacecraft and NASA-style facilities. There aren't a whole lot of standard building pieces, but that's alright -- at the time, you probably already had those, so this kit offered excellent MOC material that was difficult to find anywhere else. Even now, it's one of only two sets in which the three-facet side panels can be found in white.<br></p><p>The holographic and magnetic stickers are beautiful, really making the facility stand out on the shelf. This set includes a magnet so that you get full use out of the magnetic stickers, and also has the red/blue panels to see the hidden images.</p><p>I got my model used, and a few of the parts at the base (the large black disks the Outpost stands on) have started to lose clutch power. Fortunately, the parts making up the base are extremely common and easy to replace.<br></p><p></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Two Explorien minifigs are included. They have the same head, but one of them has a more elaborate breathing apparatus and slightly different uniform. The figures are not really that special, but nice to have.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The construction process for this model has a few places where the whole structure is relatively weak; it's very easy in those steps to break the model apart if you're not careful. Younger builders could easily become frustrated in these steps and give up on the model. I think it's a mistake to stop there, however; the payoff at the end is having a unique-looking model that really stands apart from the other Classic Space bases.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>A thing of ungainly beauty, the Outpost is obviously meant to be standalone research instrument, not an actual base where the Exploriens would live. The top section rotates, the panels open, and the telescope can be moved and pointed in just about any direction. The bottom section has a large viewscreen with a holographic sticker, perhaps a communicator, and also has panels that open.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is my favorite Space model of all time, so I may be a bit biased, but I think the value you get for the money is high. You get a number of odd parts to make your own MOCs. This set is easily worth it if you can find it for $15; Space enthusiasts might go as high as $20 and it will still be a bargain.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"James83","2017-08-24T11:57:59.253Z","Lightweight Space Station","<p>This was the only Exploriens set I owned. I never really got behind the theme. It seemed to be a reincarnation of the peaceful&nbsp;scientific M-Trons and had some magnetic elements but also the clever red/blue filters. The Expolriens&nbsp;were heavily reliant on stickers,&nbsp;the hologram and&nbsp;changing red/blue images on the magnetic stickers were a novel touch but its a shame the fun elements of the theme relied on stickers.</p>

<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>

<p>This set is a small observatory outpost for conducting exportations from. This is not a fully fledged base set but rather a smaller stand alone facility. The Exploriens&nbsp;colour scheme of black and white looked good and reminded me of NASA and the dark blue window elements looked good too and made a change from the brighter neons of the early 1990s, although the neon green still had a role in lights and dishes and radio antennas. The overall effect worked quite well.</p>

<p>The entire building stands on four dishes, its not a terribly stable set, especially when turning the top section and the entire structure is quite open and flimsy. The lower section has two opening panels and also has a hinged magnet which is pretty close to the ground but can be raised in elevation. It was only meant for picking up the magnetic stickers on the flat 2x2 bricks and so isn&#39;t as versatile as the earlier M-Tron magnets. It can be detached and used as a hand-held tool though.&nbsp;The lower section is largely empty and useless for anything due to the big central pillar supporting the upper section. It does contain a swivelling and titlting hologram sticker communications screen and a stalk antenna control, but that&#39;s it. No tool racks, no computer elements and&nbsp;no lab equipment. I think with more foresight they could have used the opposite side for a similar swiveling&nbsp;mounting for something extra. Of course you can easily make this modification yourself as there is enough space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upper section swivels on a turntable and features a cool looking multi-purpose&nbsp;telescope/scope with larger and smaller dishes, a tilting&nbsp;screen with another hologram sticker&nbsp;plus a movable antenna/ray. All four window panels open up to give access but there is little room inside for the man to stand and not much else to access. Again, it just feels most of it is wasted space. On the roof are two radio antennas. Overall this set promises more than it delivers. Yes, as an isolated outpost it probably does the job but the lack of equipment and the reliance on hologram stickers and the reliance on folding sections that don&#39;t reveal or access anything are disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with two minifigures. One Explorien&nbsp;with a printed radio torso, printed head with brown hair and eyebrows with radio headset, grey legs, helmet with neon green visor&nbsp;and black airtanks. One Explorien&nbsp;with a printed air equipment torso, printed head with brown hair and eyebrows with radio headset, grey legs, helmet with an air hose attachment and neon green visor&nbsp;and balck airtanks. I assume the latter guy was meant for outdoor missions but both had airtanks and many other Lego spacemen make do with normal helmets when spacewalking so I&#39;m not sure what the distinction was, although the diver helmet did look cool.</p>

<p>The figures have an array of hand-held equipment, the magnet can be hand held, as can the red/blue colour&nbsp;decoder, this come with two stickered&nbsp;bricks to use. Also there is a video camera with a blue-green cone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>The Exploriens&nbsp;theme had some potential but it just seems that the reliance on stickers (there are no printed elements at all) and the minimum bricks as possible were a cost-cutting exercise by Lego and it shows. This tower is rather flimsy and wobbly compared to earlier sets.&nbsp;This set, and the theme,&nbsp;had some nice features but lacking the space needed for major personal modifications I ended up dismantling this set and building my own larger building to house the same equipment and more. It has some nice bricks such as the white panels so its easily possible to reinvent the concept into something bigger using other standard white and black bricks and Space elements.&nbsp;</p>
