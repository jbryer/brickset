The landing gear and other interesting components make this set very unique and sets it a part from its larger counterpart, the &quot;alien avenger&quot; and also unlike the avenger, it only contains 4 small saucer parts. Many have compained that these are overspecialized but the ones included in this set are small enough and versitile so that they can fit into other models requiring domes and the like. I must say, the stupid looking decals on the 2 grey sections are unatractive and do limit compatability with other sets however. All in all, This set has lots of building opportunities and if your not creative, it can be good on its own using the original design. I give this a 7, because while it is good there are much better sets to consider.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-04T17:52:23Z","A great set","I thinks this set is a great addition to anybody's space collection.  With all the rare pieces you can get it is without a doubt a great choice for anybody to get. Also it's fun to find out what the UFO's head looks like.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-05T22:28:37Z","good classic UFO","I think this set is very original. it is cool because you get an awesome looking alien and many neat pieces. The saucer even spins! i got this set a while back in 1998, and i have liked it ever since! The only problem is the legs of the ship. They are creative and all, but seem to give it the more bulkier look. There should be an easy way to fold them in. But other than that, It is a great set that i recommend to anyone who likes legos!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-13T10:36:57.64Z","Classic space set","A classic set, my second lego set. It like very a UFO, and have some pieces to create machines. The green pieces i have used in weapons like lightsabers and spaceships, they are very cool to make creations. The minifigure is one of the greatest lego characters, his colors like much a alien, and his helmet is very cool to be used in pilots of battle machines, and of course, UFO and spaceships.

"WiseWarrior","2008-11-15T19:03:23.64Z","Awesome UFO set!","Of all the UFO sets, only 2 really look like UFOs. Of course, if everyone did it wouldn't sell well, because you can only do so much to change to looks of UFOs. 

Anyways, this is a fantastic set. I got it for 10 dollars, and it was well worth the price. The actual UFO has 4 &quot;legs,&quot; and it can rotate, which is a cool feature. The color-changing brick on the top is quite cool, and so are the 4 bending lasers. The figure, like all UFO mini-figs, is very well designed and looks superb.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T15:29:23.733Z","UFO's have been spotted orbiting LEGO City.","<p>Set #6900 Cyber Saucer: Once again this was a set my brother had that I absorbed into my LEGO collection after he lost interest, ironic really since I'm the older sibling, but he grew up and I guess I never fully did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cyber Saucer was one of my favorite Space vessels that we had, it had a lot of interesting looking pieces that were unique and different and the vessel could actually rotate thanks to the spin disk that attaches the cockpit section to the landing gear base.</p>
<p>The ship will take you a good thirty minutes to build on your first try, once you know where everything goes it will most likely take you less time to build. For a ship of this size though it is unfortunate that it only included one UFO Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is a better bargain than the other release of the Cyber Saucer though, I mean aside from the large plastic UFO Alien helmet that set is just the same as this one, but it cost less. If you want some funky looking UFOs in your Space theme you can't go wrong with the larger ships of the UFO Sub-Theme. And the Mini-Figures are nice too, even though you only get one it is one of the armor wearing aliens with the helmets instead of their cyborg foot soldiers piloting this craft. Also I believe this is one of the only sets that features the transparent green saucer pieces, so for MOCing you can't go wrong with this beauty. Oh and did I forget to mention that none of these ships used stickers for details? I think LEGO should release a few Space based Legends sets soon and some of these nifty printed pieces should be brought back in those sets.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"ETAV8R","2012-11-25T19:06:36.42Z","Out of my dark ages...into the Cyber Saucer","Wish I had more of the UFO Theme. I got this set from ebay a while back and recently started to look more into old space themes. There were some really unique sets, parts, and play features. I finally decided to build my Cyber Saucer and it is great! The figure is uniquely scary and it has a targeting circle on globe of the saucer cockpit. I can imagine being a child again and how much fun I would have had incorporating this theme with my classic space sets. UFO would be the perfect silent nemesis of the exploratory space crews.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The bottom or top of this set rotates depending on which way you hold and spin it. The trans green pieces seem to glow on their own. Only three stickers and in fairly good condition on the set I purchased. All the other pieces are printed. Something lacking in the sets of today.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I qualify this statement by saying that when I say “all of us”, I’m really referring to me, but the point still stands. We (I) wanted aliens, and UFO was the first subtheme to deliver them.</div><div><br></div><div>Sadly, only one Minifigure comes with Cyber Saucer, but boy is he cool. His transparent-green head actually makes him more thematically coherent - as opposed to his orange-headed counterparts from Interstellar Starfighter (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6979-1"">6979</a>) - and his helmet and armour were among the greatest Minifig accouterments that had been released up until that time. Not only that, but I believe that Cyber Saucer was the cheapest set in which one could acquire one of these alien overlord, save perhaps for one of this weird bagged sets that you can only get in Japan or something like that. That’s just cheating, like they're prone to doing in Japan. But even so, it takes away from none of the greatness of this guy.</div><div><br></div><div>His flying saucer is more than appropriate for a Minifig of this stature. There are not many LEGO sets that are radially symmetrical, but this is one of them. It has a docking stand thing for easy landing, but, most importantly, it SPINS. There’s no point having a UFO if you can’t spin it while making <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-YG9g_4GzY&amp;feature=related"">Dr. Wily noises</a>, and Cyber Saucer allows you to do just that. Construction-wise, this set comes with a number of speciality pieces that were sort of the norm for late-90s Space sets, but I find that the speciality pieces that came with UFO were pretty cool, especially the iconic curved quarter-discs that later found a home in <i>Star Wars</i> sets. The greatest part of this is that the large pieces are actually printed and not stickers; come on, LEGO - if it was possible back then, why the sticker fixation now?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cyber Saucer looks great as a standalone set or with a fleet of UFO companions, a far more menacing intergalactic threat than anything from Alien Conquest, if you ask me. If you have any kind of LEGO town at all, do yourself a favour and get this set as the starting point for your alien invasion, because these people mean business.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
