I think it was an error and this ones model number was entered in wrong. To see the original 6901 use the search bar at the top. Been trying to review this model for a week but every time I go to review it I keep getting stuck doing something else. So now I got a few minutes here it goes.

The ship itself is quite flat spanning 8x9 studs. It has two jets, one either side of the driver, A control panel to steer and the team logo is printed on a flat plate which looks really good. No stickers here. Also an aerial laying flat down the vehicle, which is different.

The mini-fig is black and red with design printed on his pants, top and face. He has no helmet or oxygen tank.

The only thing I didn't like about the model was I get the feeling the jets are too close to the fig and force him to lean forward when he is flying.

Overall it's another general space vehicle and put with other provides hours of fun. Has one little flaw but its easily overlooked and would still recommend it to any space collector or someone who wants a red mini-fig. 5/10 from me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The minifigure in red i think that is one of the most rare. Little pieces like the ufo's logo and reds that are compatible with the weapon used as jets on backs were included in some sets later, and previous, in space themes. Cool, it have a 5/5 rate.

Second, it looks more like a starfighter than an airplane. Finally, it should have another laser on the other side. Besides that, this set needs improvement.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
