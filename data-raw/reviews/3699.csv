"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-10T18:03:54Z","Unique and Fascinating","When I got this one as a gift, I was kind of disapointed. It was definitely the ugliest Lego kit I had seen up to that time. But, after building and playing with it, it took on a certain fascination for me. Certainly no other vehicle was as radical in design, with the raised chassis, the flexible arm, and the roomy interior. It was perfect for swamp adventures and hostile-area sample collecting. It could act as a rescue vehicle with plenty of room for extra astronauts inside. The two big doors increased access to the interior of the lab, and the trans-green &quot;radiation shield&quot; in the front protected the scientists from the rare isotopes they were collecting.
The equipment clips on the sides were a brand new element for me, and I thought they were a great idea.
 
One drawback of the design is that the &quot;sensor device&quot; often came loose and fell off of the arm, the join between the pieces is badly designed. The shovel head works much better; but unfortunately, while you could neatly stow the shovel underneath, you didn't have anywhere to put the sensor device except inside or on top, where it looked pretty silly.

I always thought of this thing as an elephant on wheels, but it was a crucial element of my Outworld space colony.
Highly recommended!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

 i bought a few bulk lots of space lego on ebay and ended up with spares to build this gem. ugly it may be but this is space after all and function over form is the key here. good companion to 894 mobile tracking station and has good playability. it is one of the vehicles that i want to have fit into a super galaxy explorer i am currently designing along with 894. a rare set if you find it and one to pick up if you can get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2014-09-03T03:37:48.827Z","A concept too ambitious for its time...","<p>This set is a fascinating anomaly.&nbsp; It feels strange to be writing a mixed review of a classic Space set, given this theme is (rightly) so revered amongst Lego fans of all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when compared to classics like 928, 6929 and other sets which surrounded it from the early Space years, the Mobile Lab simply doesn&#39;t stack up. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The set does contain an interesting array of parts - an impressive number of hinges, landing struts, homemaker arms and trans-green elements in particular.&nbsp; And the overall&nbsp;design concept&nbsp;of the set - like some sort of beetle rolling across the alien landscape as it surveys for minerals - is undoubtedly interesting.&nbsp; However the set is simply let down too much by annoying flaws:</p>

<ul>
	<li>there is an unaccountable gap where&nbsp;the front windscreen should be - Classic Space sets of this era are&nbsp;either &quot;space tight&quot; like the 918-928 space ships, or exposed to the elements, like 897 for example, with the astronauts&#39; space suits left to do the protecting, and hence far more lightweight and manouevrable.&nbsp;This set is a frustrating blend of the two concepts whilst satisfying neither - it is ungainly yet unprotected at the same time.</li>
	<li>Despite being described as a &quot;lab&quot;, and clearly designed to conduct surveys of alien worlds, there is no technological equipment inside for the astronauts to analyse their samples.&nbsp;Decorated 2x2 45 slopes (standard and inverted) were available at this time and their absence in this set is a serious omission.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Larger diameter tyres were available at this time (see the Town sets for 1980) and would have been far more appropriate for what is obviously intended to be an all terrain vehicle.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>As we all know, even the great Lego Group is capable of error, and this set - even in such a legendary theme as the early Classic Space years - is one such example.&nbsp; Buy it only if you&#39;re a collector, and if so place it last on your list of early Space sets.&nbsp;</p>

What I don't like about it is that it's not really a ""Lab"". Just an empty interior with a steering wheel and room for the two Minifigs. Where are the computers and the storage compartments? And the opening doors are nice touch, but it doesn't really open the interior up that well.  This comes across more as a trial run for later sets that allowed opening roofs, and more accessibility for playing.  If it had just a couple two or three studs longer it would have allowed for a lot more interactivity.

What I did like about it was the Green trans and Grey aesthetic that Lego would go back to in later sets.  And I liked the articulated armature on the front with the ""scanning tool"".  It was a unique and inventive look that was lost in later sets.  And finally I enjoyed the wheel set up.  Not so much the actual wheels which were the old school tiny versions, but the raised cab and the multitude of wheels gave it a nice unique look.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>This space rover is a bit weird looking and impractical, but it&#39;s got great playability and is a welcome change from the more common shuttles and ships.&nbsp; There&#39;s lots of good parts in the original grey color as well.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>There are only around 100 pieces so it comes together fairly quickly.&nbsp; It&#39;s not a bad build though for the size.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty standard for a 1980 set, and I enjoyed it.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Lots of good classic space pieces here.&nbsp; 4 printed pieces in light grey with moons as well as 6 of the supports which have become quite valuable in light grey.&nbsp; Plenty of other useful pieces like trans green bricks (which I loved as a kid) and a trans green windshield as well as the grapple arm and shovel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>As mentioned above, playability is great considering the number of pieces. 2 spacemen in different colors is a good choice and they&#39;ve got plenty of accessories and options with the opening back end of the rover.&nbsp; Combined with Galaxy explorer or another base set, this would make for a fun afternoon.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>No idea what this cost when it first came out, but it&#39;s fairly rare now with only 8 listings on Bricklink as of this writing.&nbsp; It seems to go for about $75 used.&nbsp; I would say it&#39;s good enough to pick up if you&#39;re a fan of classic space and can find it around $50 or less.&nbsp;</p>
