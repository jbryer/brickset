"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-22T13:40:48Z","Highlight of any City or Town","I had the original but re-purchased this set for new pieces and to make it the center of my train layout.  MODEL/DESIGN (9.5): I love the single-sided buildings, esp. the auto repair shop. This building could be used for anything. The detail and architecture of the 2nd floor is what I like most (arches, multi-color, and roof top design).  A closing garage door or maybe a large optional window piece would have been nice to close it up, but the building is still my favorite; and because of its color and height, it really stands out. The Legoland Hotel is also a nice building.  Built with modular construction, the walls can be quickly built and disassembled with the crane.  It does lack furniture though. The crane is a nice addition really adding to the city feel. Nice construction and easy to slide back and forth. The truck is nicely done as well as a little yellow car. I don’t mind the new plastic wheel pieces at all.  The set also includes a nice assortment of seven minifigs, four road signs, a nice lamppost, and a popcorn stand.  These also add to the nice detail of the set.
PIECE ASSORTMENT/COLOR (10): Great standard 1x1s, 2x1s, 3x1s, 6x1s, and 8x1s actually allow you to build walls. I also like the assortment of windows and two traditional doors (one in blue and the other in white). The color assortment is nice primarily consisting of red, white, and blue.  
ALTERNATE MODELS (10): With an abundance of standard pieces, this set provides a multitude of alternative models with some great ideas on the back of the box.
COST (8): This set costs $65 with another $5-$8 for shipping driving the price up to over $70. It’s a great set but I still find $65-$70 a little pricey for two buildings, crane, and accessories.  It’s probably in line, however, with the new World City sets.
PLATABILITY (10): With two buildings, vehicles, figs, and a working crane, this set offers much fun and hour of play. It’s fun just setting up.
DISLIKES: I had to swap out the old gray road plates to match the newer green w/yellow line plates. This may be a legend, but it should be compatible with the new sets. As mentioned above, the auto shop needs some sort of closed garage and the hotel is absent of all furniture. I like the figs but would have like new modern figs with detailed faces. Lastly, I don’t like stickers.
OVERALL, this is a great set, and aside from just a few dislikes, the set is a 10 in my book. I see why this was re-released as a Legend and it’s a great addition to any town/city.

"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-29T11:37:00Z","WOW!","Ahhhh, what a relief.  I just finished building this main street.  I never had in in my youth, because it was not available over here, but this is a true classic.
When I was a kid I used to own several town sets.  The 588(381 Euro) police station, and several other sets.  Well, building this brings back childhood memories!  This is just like the way it used to be in the late seventies early eighties!  I love it!  Great to build the car and truck!  All the small pieces rule!  This is awesome!  I would highly recommend  this set to everyone!  You will learn what true Lego building is with this set!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T13:16:24Z","Instant town!","This set seems rather basic, with rather standard (but good) 80's figures, but it just epitomises 80's town at it's best.  

I like this set because it has 2 buildings rather than 1 like a fire station or medical centre set.  It can thus make your town more of a town more easily because it takes up 2 baseplates.  It also means more places for minifigs to go and check in to.  Overall, A great set with not bad versatility, but a little lacking in style and special touches. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

To anyone to answer: How do you put together the sign on the top of the hotel? there were no directions.

Also the construction workers were good but the crane was stupid!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-01T18:41:12Z","The set is great!","They give you pics on how to make the sign, they figured it was common sense and didn't put diections to it.

The set is great even through it doean't use the new road plates.  The two biuldings are emty, but it doesn't take too many bricks to make they real nice.  The crane is amazing, I'm going to make a truck or something for it so it can be portable.  The people are great old fashion kind, they look like the village people.  :)  No big pieces just the small great ones that everyone loves.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-06T14:20:48Z","WOW!","great set! it would of been better if there was a mechanic and a hotel clerk. but it still deserves a 10 and you have to destroy the crane if you want to finish the hotel and add the stuff inside it like the bed and chair. also it would be better if there was a police car for the cop and pop corn for the pop corn stand",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-16T15:00:51Z","The best set ever made in LEGO history!!","This is the one...The only...MAIN STREET! THe set itself is just plain awesome. I'm so glad Lego released this as a lego legend. The old one looks a little boring. It deserves to be one! The minifigures and buildings in this set make it a true calssic!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-11T18:34:03Z","Great set/awesome alternatives","I love this set as much as everyone else.  I just wish they had put the original train crossing rails in it instead of using the tiles.  It would make building the crane and hotel sign so much easier.  It's confusing to look at the pictures from the old original set, but not have all the original pieces (i.e. check out the girl they show her with black pigtails, the crossing rails used for the sign and crane rails).  All in all though, this is what Lego should be creating more of.  Lots of the small pieces that can be used to build hundreds of other models from one set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-22T17:50:30Z","A Darn cool set","One of the best town themed sets LEGO has ever produced.  The LEGOLAND Hotel really is a great touch.  It's too bad, though, that you have to dismantle the truck to make furniture for the hotel, but then again you could always make your own furniture and keep the truck.  I only wish they had made some kind of sepcialized hotel manager minifig, but then again the earlier lego sets weren't into customized lego figs.  All in all a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-14T12:40:16.973Z","Endless fun","Forget the dumbed-down, juniorised, over-specialised  or film/TV tie-ins of today.  This is an example of what real Lego sets were like.  This set consists of two buildings - a hotel under construction and an auto-repair centre.  There is a crane working on the hotel, and the street is well-detailed with such features as an ice-cream stand, chairs, trees and a lamp post.  The weath of pieces mean that there's no limit to alternative building.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
