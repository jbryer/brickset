"Blade","2007-09-05T23:47:42.863Z","One Big Blaster","I cant believe that out of 124 people that own this set no one has put in a review. Well im going to be the first.

The spaceship itself I very solid with good think block to bulk it up. It has a massive light or laser at the front which is really awesome. It has the Insectiods logo on it, handles over the controls and the control panel seems slightly alien. It also has a long thin laser on either side of the vehicle.

The mini-fig has black pants and tank, grey shirt and head and green arms and mask. I really felt the green should have been blue to match in better with the vehicle but might have made him too much like the UFO series. His head has lots of detailed metal bits on it and the mask is very different to the normal mask. Also he is holding a fluoro yellow, triangular device which seems very suited to the set, but despite all the printed parts all over the model, this piece needs a small sticker!

Overall its a great model. Very aesthetically pleasing colour scheme and shape. Not much playability alone but together with another Insectoid or other space set is really good due to the parts. So i feel this set is a 6/10. Above average but still just a small 90's model. Definitely pick one up if you get a chance. Great addition to all space sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The glow green pieces like the UFO series,and the cristal, a good magnetic piece can be magnetized with some insectoids. It contains blue parts, with gray make a great color scheme.

"WiseWarrior","2008-10-30T17:47:38.687Z","Not that Insectoid like","The Insectoid series is based around aliens piloting robots in the shape of common bugs. It's a simple, yet awesome idea, and most sets carry it well. However, this one doesn't. 

It is basically a tiny spaceship, which is fine for any normal space line of sets, but for Insectoids it isn't. It would have been nice to at least have 2 wings, even if it had no legs. However, as a spaceship it really isn't that bad, it simply doesn't match the theme.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BasiltheBatlord","2009-04-02T20:47:34.623Z","Shere Scout","I got this set along with Beta Buzzer, and I think they make a good scouting party together. Some people complain that it isn't much like an insect. I agree, but it's still very nice. It includes a Green Insectoid, with an energy sphere. The craft itself is equipped with two percisions lasers, and one large energy cannon. A small craft, but it has a sting!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The only cool things which you might like about this set are the unique crystal which has a sticker and the minifig. It's also good for the other pieces which you can use for MOC's or brickfilms and it's a good army builder as well. The transparent dome in the front looks the same as the one in the LEGO Power Miners - Fire Blaster set. The only difference about these domes is that the one we get in this set has some bubbles in it. There's a nice computer for the figure and the antennas on each side are supposed to be lasers which is very nice too. As I told in the beginning: This set doesn't have any play features but it looks very nice and it's a good addition to your LEGO collection anyway.<br><br><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ideas:</span><br><br>This

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T15:37:55.323Z","Bug Zapper meet Bug Blaster","<p>Set #6903 Bug Blaster: The best thing about this set aside from the price was that it gave you a chance to troop build Insectoids and gather lots of Insectoid Orbs at a good price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said the model is a little bit on the weaker side of Space ships. I once built a duplicate of this model minus the unique Insectoid dome pieces using spare parts to have two. (I hadn't considered buying another one at the time since I was after all only allowed so much money for LEGO back then.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say if you get this model in some sort of Insectoid lot or something you won't be dissapointed too much, but it is a limited set, there is very little you can do with it on its own, there aren't any gimmicks and LEGO did not include a magnet brick of any kind to pick up the orb. I still recommend it, but only to those die hard Space Theme collectors looking for some spare pieces or another new model to craft, for the casual Space Theme collector I'd say you can do with just one or two Insectoid sets, probably the Arachnoid Star Base and one of the small ships, and that'll hold you over&nbsp;for your&nbsp;display. Of course you may change your mind, after all once you start it is hard to stop at just one.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-01-07T22:27:50.56Z","Bugs in space.","<div>Ostensibly, the design goal of the Insectoids faction was to mimic the look of various insects (surprise?), and, for the most part, I feel that the line succeeded very well. Unfortunately, the smallest set of the line seems to suffer from a fatal flaw in that it really doesn’t look much like anything, let alone a bug of any kind (or perhaps one hitherto unknown to science).</div><div><br></div><div>I suppose that the constraints associated with having to design a set with 30 pieces or less might partially account for this, although, conversely, the Beta Buzzer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6817-1"">6817</a>) succeeded in at least incorporating wings and a stinger into its design in spite of having only a few pieces more. Bug Blaster, for its part, looks barely aerodynamic.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not all bad, though. The colour scheme works nicely with all of the other Insectoids vehicles, and you do get a cool transparent-green half-dome piece, along with one of those Insectoid-crystal thingies that are ubiquitous throughout the subtheme. The Minifig is your standard Insectoid trooper, although I do prefer the light green/blue Minifig slightly more compared to this guy. All the same, the Insectoids Minifigs are all hands-down cool, almost approaching the coolness of their UFO predecessors.</div><div><br></div><div>If you happen to have a few other Insectoids sets and need a small vehicle to augment your fleet, then Bug Blaster will fit right in; if not, you could certainly cannibalise its pieces and put them to use elsewhere. Otherwise, it would be quite forgivable to give this particular a set a miss.</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
