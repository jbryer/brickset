The Sonic Stinger is a giant fly, complete with giant wings and sound, though the noise can get annoying. It looks very realistic, at least as realistic as a robotic Lego fly can get. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCollector125","2011-08-08T18:02:17.27Z","A Great Example of the Insectoids Theme","<p>Insectoids is a theme often underrated because of the one use parts and strange concept, however, this set is one of the hidden jems of this theme. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box and instructions, as usual, show the set well. The instructions also show the color differences well.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set has an incredible selection of unique parts, most of which are unique to this theme. These include the wings, Insectoid logo piece, crystals, and the large space cannon. The set also includes the light and sound brick, which flashes and makes 3 different sounds. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The one minifigure in the set is the leader of the Insectoids, and shows the elaborate printing featured on most of the series's figures. She also has a gray armor piece, and a trans-green helmet. Overall, a great figure. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build of the set is fun, showcasing various techniques to attach the special pieces and light brick. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished product is great, and looks just like a giant insect. The one issue may be the durability, as the joints that attach the wings have a tendency to break as they get older. The light brick adds a lot of size to the set, but also good playability. It also fits the fighter perfectly. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, a great set of the Insectoids theme, showing many great pieces, and being a good example of the theme as a whole. The figure is great, the set has a good value for the money, and great playability. I highly recommend this set to any LEGO fan, and it is a must have for space theme collectors. </p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

The build was short but sweet and after a while of having it I cant stop using it.</p><p>Its light and sound makes it 10x better&nbsp;but replacing the batteries is a slight pain. The set is a very bad price with high price per peice but like the celestial stinger the playability makes up for it. </p><p><strong>Pros -</strong></p><p>Very good structure.</p><p>Light and sound.</p><p>Good minifigs.</p><p>Nice playability.</p><p>Insectoid classic.</p><p>Good addition to your space/insectoid theme.</p><p>Nice build.</p><p><strong>Cons -</strong></p><p>Price.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
