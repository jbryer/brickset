I have always been a big fan of the UFO sets, and liked everyone of them, but this one is about my favorite. It has a Star Wars x-wing type of model. The cockpit in the back is neat, and all the lasers on the front and wings of the ship make it a force to be reckoned with! The tubes connecting the front to the back make it look stylish and awesome at the same time! A great combination. The front window where the alien sits is unique with the targeting system, and the back engines are a beauty! If anyone can get a hold of this great set, You must!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-11T14:08:26Z","An excellent fighter set","This compact set combines excellent desgin with great playability. I really like the colour scheme and don't mind the pre-pritned saucer pieces too much, though that may irk other enthusiasts. Except for the fixed landing gear, this set is just about flawless and feels very sturdy. The UFO minifigs are my favourite minifigs because their transparent heads are simply awesome, and their masks/shoulder pads give them a regal look--this set happens to come with the red pilot. A pleasant surprise is the weapons droid in the rear of the craft! That makes 2 minifigs in a medium-sized set that has an excellent design--probably the best set in the UFO lineup.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-23T15:14:44Z","Awesome!","I got this for Christmas (Thanks Bricklink!) and it is awesome! It was reasonably priced when it first was released, and it has a lot of play value! Also the trans-orange head on the alien is really cool! I give this set a 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"haoye","2007-07-29T05:04:40.52Z","Maybe Lucas made them change the design?","An excellent set.  It had good design, two different, minifigs, and somehow managed to even incorporate the small saucer pieces and still have a ship that looked sleek and fast.  I was a little disappointed when I first got it, because a previous sneak peek catalog showed it with four &quot;lasers&quot; instead of the two that are on the bottom wings only.  (very x-wing inspired design, I imagine)  I dug up the necessary pieces from my collection to restore it to its original badass-edness. :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-24T10:26:17.27Z","One of the better later space sets","Lego's space sets went downhill a bit in the mid 90s imho. The UFO theme was not quite as good as the Ice Planet theme for example. However, this was one of the better sets. Its design is sleek and it has a lot of the pieces that were introduced in this line of sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-08-20T11:58:50.67Z","Amazing set!","First off this set is amazing... the details are awesome, and the decorated parts are cool too. The set does have tools and plenty of cool parts. Two minifigures fit this set fine since three would grossly overdo it. The only major flaw is that the setails (antennaes) are flimsy and pop off to often. The set has a cockpit for the pilot, a lock (which also holds the tools) for the storage which houses the droid. The three main boosters in the back are also really cool, but what the set doesn't have, which would make it perfect, is a hinge for the landing gear, instead of just a pillar. All in all a great set for any space related collection since the design is just plain cool, but is generally overpriced today, so $20 and under is a fair price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2009-01-22T23:45:47.5Z","Best set out of the UFO theme, without a doubt","This set is amazing. It's got a ton of detail, an awesome design, and plenty of neat features. UFO is a great theme, and this is a great set! 

To begin, the construction of this set is quite sturdy. The only flimsy parts are the antennae/laser guns, which fall off if you're not careful. But the mainframe is build like a rock- those unpopular UFO plates really did make for some sturdy structures, despite their excessive printing. 

The construction in this set is unparalleled by any other 1997 Space set, as far as I'm concerned. The cockpit is compact and airtight, with a printed control panel and a cozy fit for the alien. The front half of the ship is sturdy and sleek... even if you hate the printing on the quarter-plates, you have to admit they make this set look WAY better- would have been boring if it was just gray. The back half is complete with THREE awesome thrusters as well as additional propulsion on each wing AND some more besides that... this ship is meant to go FAST. It sure looks fast, too- I can see this speeding into battle against a fleet of Rebel Hunters... and in terms of firepower the Warp Wing has the Rebel Hunters trumped! It's got four main cannons as well as some kind of additional ray thing on top of the ship, which can open up to reveal the android seated in the midsection. 

I really like how stylishly that feature is pulled off, too- rather than throwing the ugly ""arrow bricks"" everywhere, you can't actually see the arrow bricks on the doors to the midsection unless you open up the top. Nice touch. 

Another thing I love about this set is the level of detail. It doesn't just rely on excessive decals; it has several nice touches. First off it's got four hoses connected to the guns and the secondary thrusters. These do pop off sometimes, but they lend it a great look. It's also got some greebs on the midsection that you can't see in the box art; cool touch there. The back have of the set has a ton of propulsion and weaponry, making this a very intimidating fighter. 

This set isn't perfect though. As I mentioned some parts do pop off, and unfortunately all of these parts are located exactly where I would instinctually pick up the ship. Also, I feel like the back end is a little short- it should have been extended a little longer to reduce the ""sort"" look of the fighter. 

Otherwise though, this set is excellent. The minifigs are AWESOME- the alien is amazing, with a cool printed body, awesome alien neck-dress thing, trans-orange head and a great helmet to boot. It also comes with a robot, which is nice, but not as good as the alien.

Love or hate UFO, it's hard to deny that some of the designs were very inspired. This set is the best in the UFO theme, including two minifigs and some very rare printed parts. If you can't get behind this set, then UFO will never appeal to you- UFO fans, though, will celebrate this as a Space classic! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-04T15:23:36.45Z","Woah!","This set is incredibly sleek and good looking. It probably could go extremly fast. The minifigures are awesome, and this ship is finally a break from all of the boring human space themes. It is probably the best ship in this entire theme, and tis deserves a 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"unitron6991","2010-02-27T12:05:56.077Z","The best LEGO Spacefighter","<p>My grandparents gave me one of these for Christmas one year, then the next year they gave me another one! I just can not get over the awesomeness of the UFO theme. The only thing I do to improve this is to add another set of&nbsp;antennas to the top wings. That makes it look even more menacing. A good match for any of the *human* ships. Why doesn't TLG come out with more like this?</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-29T03:02:14.607Z","An excellent addition to any space fan's collection!","This set is currently the highest rated in the entire UFO theme. While I still think that the Alien Avenger is the best, this one is very good too. I happened to get it, along with Radon Rover and an incomplete Cyber Saucer for only $21 bucks from an awesome seller on Bricklink!

Now then, on to the features. This set has 2 Mini-Figs, a Red Alien, and a Red Worker Drone. Each is, like always, very detailed and cool-looking. The Drone is hiding toward the back of the ship, and can only come out if you open 2 doors, and lift up the back of the ship. I like the idea, but that's a lot of protection for a Drone...

The overall design of the ship works very well, and the many lasers and rockets make it look very powerful, which I'm sure it would be if it was real. Overall, if you can find it cheap you should pick it up right away.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T15:51:23.73Z","Does it Warp or Wing?","<p>Set #6915 Warp Wing Fighter: UFO introduced us all to the saucer piece and then LEGO just up and decided to vanish it from all future Space Themes. What a shame, but at least they milked that sucker for all it was worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Warp Wing Fighter is yet another large ship that I have particularly fond memories of. As far as spaceships go it looks a little like something that might fit in right at home in the Star Wars or Star Trek universe. It has a front saucer section, large sweeping x-wings loaded with firepower and three massive engines to propell it through space.</p>
<p>Building this particular model was a blast back in the day, I hope my cousin enjoyed it as much as I did, the Mini-Figure is a nifty little touch too, but I believe there is a secret in this set. Is there? Oh you bet your life there is... The rear section can open up to accomodate both Mini-Figures in a secret compartment area. I think you might have to take his armor off in order to close it back up again, but I'm confident that both Mini-Figures in this set could be placed within the ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should take a moment to discuss all of the printing of the UFO Mini-Figures. I would have to say that all of their printing looked very nice, even though they did not come with double-sided torsos. Their chests, legs, heads, helmets, everything looked neat and stood out amongst similar Space Mini-Figures. LEGO was a bit bolder back then and trying new things, well they never really stopped, but I think some of their choices in those days were a bit better than the more modern attempts at unique Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd strongly recommend this set to everyone who enjoys LEGO Space sets, and even those who only collect LEGO Star Wars, the Warp Wing Fighter could almost pass for a crude attempt at a LEGO X-Wing, and as a bonus it features some interesting Mini-Figures to put in your Mos Eisley Cantina or where ever else you should choose. It would be nice to see a few sets from the earlier Space Themes brought back as Legends, but it has been eight years since LEGO gave us the Legends. (2002 was when they made Legends available and I think that was the only year they did too, but I could be wrong.) Still LEGO should reconsider bringing back some of these sets so that modern collectors can know the joy of such sets without haveing to hunt for them on E-Bay or similar sites.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-05T13:06:56.94Z","UFO Invasion!","<p>Well, I'm a little annoyed because when I got this set, it was missing the minifigures, the best part of the set, along with a host of other parts. So, I will be reviewing on the set only, not the minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Warp Wing Fighter is really a cool set, and a set has to be pretty great for me to still like it without it having the minifigs. In the fron of the ship, there are some great curved UFO pieces, and an awesome cockpit. Behind that is another thing that opens, which I suspect would be four the red android minifigure, though, I don't know. I really enjoy the black chord pieces running on the outside of the set, along with the giant antenna-like lasers. On the top is a great cannon and two pieces with really cool sticker effects. The circular&nbsp;color changing UFO piece and the multicolored other piece. Though both of these pieces were missing their stickers in the one I got, they are still cool pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the Warp Wing Fighter is an amazing set, although it must be much more amazing to have it with the minifigs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
