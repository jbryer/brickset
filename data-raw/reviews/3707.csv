Not much to say about this set, it contains enough straight pieces to cover about 4 and a half 32 x 32 baseplates and two long curves. There are 8 low and 8 high supports included making it possible to make a low and high loop. The only criticism is that it could have usefully included 2 up and down ramps ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
