"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-10T06:33:38Z","Great Set!","This set is a winner! There are so many great parts to this set like those wings in the middle, the storage box and the M:Tron logo pieces. I got in MISB, and I am so impressed with this set, I will not let it get damaged! I do not have many of these sets but I am catching up!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SweetBoy","2005-08-04T08:02:59Z","The fun is in the details","A brilliant set and the first M-Tron lego I owned. The model has plenty of little extras, the two sets of hinged wings, the crane arm with magnetised toolbox and the central compartment with robot. Plenty of playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-22T20:52:46.747Z","Nice set.","I was apprehensive of M-Tron when I first saw the sets in a Lego catalogue years ago, but the models really are good.  This is no exception, is a well-detailed spacecraft boasting a crane for moving a container, a compartment for an android and helicopter-like blades (which are incidentally fun to twirl around).

The ionizer has a stroage conpartment, a detachable robot, an awesome rotor assembly, a crane , and 1 figure.  I just like how it was designed with so many functions.  You can also easily make it carry a couple troops in the mid-section.  Ot's a futeristic copter and worth the money to purchase.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bvk122","2010-01-07T16:00:27.513Z","Great example of why the middle-age Lego Space was so fantastic!","This set has to be one of my favorite models ever, so it's fitting I do my first review on this set!

The model looks like a helicopter with a single rotor. Interestingly, this model was revised a year later with a change in the rotor connection. The newer model didn't break as easily. On this picture you can see the old type. The new type had the rotor head connected with two clips on the black bracket on front. 

The craft holds one person, a robot and a cargo container. Additionally, there are tools attached to the vessel and to the container.

A nice detail is the double control panel. Often a LEGO cockpit will have only one control, but here you have a small gray square, and a M:TRON controller. Attached to the cockpit is some sort of tool. It looks like a gun which doesn't really fit in with the M:TRON theme (which are miners/scientists) but it could also be an analyzer or something similar. Above the cockpit there is an air-intake (in space?! maybe in atmosphere) or an heat exhaust. Next to it there are also two smaller vents connected via pipes to the lower part of the rotor assemble. As in the helicopters we know, the rotor can be tilted forward, though not that far. Below the rotors there are wings that stick out with the red wings attached sideways which hold the logo and grills. A nice thing about the set is that it has the M:TRON logo 4 times!

Behind this we have 2 gray wings which open to reveal a space for the robot to be stored. To place it in, it needs to be folded The robot itself is a great design and has no special pats, so you can make more and change the colors to go with any other theme! Between these wings and the cockpit there are 2 clips (one on each side) that hold a transceiver and a wrench (which doubles as a tool to split stuck LEGO parts!) The wings also have extended red wings on them with extra boosters/steering rockets/ or whatever you imagine on it. On top of this, there is a rotating crane with a magnet on it. The reach is quite good. 

Behind this section is the container holder area, which fits the container very snugly.  You use the crane to lift in in and out. There are two further wings on the sides which can swivel up and down. Again there are small rockets on here, these are even better because they have back plates. 


The container also has an antenna, a hammer, and two other tools. Inside the container is a finned rocket back! One of my favorite yet very small details are the exhaust nozzles on the back. They are very small but really finish the model of nicely.

Below the ship you find 2 larger exhausts.

If you compare this model to it's bigger brother, the Stellar Voyager, you get so much more value, features and quality! I have all 7 M:TRON sets (8 if you include the super vehicle) and this is by far the best executed.

PROS:
- many details
- lots of tools and playability buffers
- very functional, every part has a function

CONS:
- the exhaust tube connectors come off easily.

On a more personnel note, I'm also very fond of this set because my parents bought it for me when we visited LEGOLAND in Billund on holiday when i was a lot younger. My father also remembers that it was very pricey there compared to the normal shops back home!

Really, get this! They don't cost that much on eBay and such, and you won't regret it!

I have all of the M-Tron sets and would say they are probably my favorite space faction, but this set was a miss for me.<div><br></div><div>The design is blocky and not very sleek. The cargo box doesn't rest in the rear bay and is always lopsided. The ""propeller"" baffles me. What the devil is it? Even the robot was a disappointment for me.</div><div><br></div><div>If you can only get one M-Tron ship go for the Stellar Recon Voyager. I'd only pick this one up to have the parts to build the secret model.</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,4
"Faefrost","2016-12-21T19:34:11.857Z","One of my favorites of the old school Space ships","<p>This is just a wonderful little ship. Something about it just keeps drawing the eyes and the hands. It is a nice clean distinct little lego cargo hauler or scout, with a bit of a Space going Helicopter vibe to it. Everything about this model just sings to the child in you. A nice sleek yet slightly chunky and greeblied design. Cargo action and plenty of storage space for a small ship. Other than the rotor the build is rock solid. Lots of what are now unique and rare parts. An Mtron fig plus Robot. A+ all around. If you are looking for an entry point for early Lego Space ships or are branching out past Classic Space, this is a fantastic starting point. A lot of value in a little space.</p>
