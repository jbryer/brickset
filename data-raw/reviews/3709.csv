<p>Apart from that I played many hours with this one accompanied with some other space sets.</p>

<p>I like the mini spacecraft hidden in the back!</p>

"LordDunsany","2020-12-14T06:08:23.003Z","Futuristic-looking Rover â€“ could use more in the middle","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is the largest Futuron land vehicle (excluding the monorail).&nbsp; It has a nice futuristic look, with a mostly white build, vertical canopy, and interesting headlight assembly.&nbsp; The wheel suspension using technic bricks, hinged design, and sensor dishes located at the sides of the front and back sections are reminiscent of 6928 (which I feel is a superior vehicle, subtheme aesthetics aside).&nbsp; The driver&rsquo;s cabin contains 2 computer tiles on either side of the driver and is unfortunately very open at the rear corners, with large gaps between the two white tail pieces and the 2-stud wide rear support (you can see how bad these gaps look in side and side-rear views in the 3D viewer).&nbsp; Behind the cabin there is a docking station for two brick-built droids that almost look like they belong in Blacktron with their all-black build and trans-yellow bug eyes.&nbsp; Interestingly, this is the only appearance of trans-yellow parts in official Futuron subtheme sets although trans-yellow does appear in the aesthetically proto-Futuron Light and Sound sets from late Classic Space (6750, 6780, and 6783).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The rear trailer section contains a covered garage that lifts to reveal a small flying craft piloted by another yellow Futuron astronaut.&nbsp; The craft, while fairly simple in design (little more than a flying chair with control sticks), fits fairly snugly in the closed garage with the pilot seated, although I do wish there were some transparent pieces built into the garage walls so that the pilot can see outside before preparing to launch.&nbsp; There is a lot of empty unused stud space in front of the garage (as well as a bit behind the droids) that, combined with the squared-off plate corners, makes the middle of the vehicle look unappealing and incomplete (6928 had a better-looking connection design).&nbsp; Adding a tool rack, computer station, and/or mini-ladder plate elements along the sides really helps with the look of this section (although having ladder pieces here does make the set more difficult to pick up as this area is a natural hand-hold). &nbsp;As noted by an earlier review, the black hinge elements that connect the two sections can be fairly weak during construction and may make it difficult to build the upper sections without inadvertently separating the hinge and detaching the trailer section (which does not stand up on its own due to the design of the wheel suspension).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Playability wise, the set is great, with vehicle suspension (allowing it to easily drive over obstacles), two astronauts, two droid companions, and a mini flying scooter for scouting (the addition of some cargo and/or tools would have tipped it to 5 stars for this criteria).&nbsp; Aesthetically, however, the gappy driver&rsquo;s cabin and the awkwardly insubstantial mid-section are serious enough flaws to make this one of the weaker designs both in the Futuron line and among other Lego Space mid-large land vehicles.</p>
