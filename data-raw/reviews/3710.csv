Once it arrived I realized that it has a lot going for it. The vehicle has a base chassis which also has a small &quot;science station&quot; attached and then a command module that can detach with small &quot;jump&quot; jets. It is easy to imagine that it is some kind of search vehicle and that the home unit can be stationary and use the command module to lift off and do an aerial survey.
As far as design, TLG hit a home run as this set is well constructed and the big wheels really can float over just about anything (this thing is way more &quot;all terrain&quot; then the 6927 which is one of my fave sets!) It also still has that &quot;classic space&quot; coloration and the parts are pretty useful for other models( lots of long technic beams and pins) I have one and will probably buy another when I see a good deal. I like this set, it is a keeper.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Classic space reached its peak in the mid-eighties, as this set demonstrates.  The model splits into three smaller models - a spacecraft, a two-man buggy and a ground control centre.  As well as a lot of useful pieces, there is endless play possibility and limitless scope for alternative building.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Has the 3 ships and it is sleek looking.  Unfortunately, you  cannot fit 2 people on the lower chairs, but what I did, I flipped the chairs facing back and then they fitted well.  A great way to start your lego collection",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
