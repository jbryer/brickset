"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T20:05:30Z","","Simple set.  Only problem was that there are 2 small special blocks that got sucked up by the evil vacuum cleaner.  These blocks were needed to have the lab properly lifted into the bay of the tranporter. :(  The transporter by itself without the lab was a bit front heavy so it didn't really roll well.  Plus the wheels weren't normal as they snapped into the technic pieces so they didn't roll well to begin with.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Completely new, unopened, real MISB ! STILL NEW !!!
I remember all the joy I had with it when I was a child, 23 years later, the pleasure is the SAME.
Everything works great (wheels, lock system, ...), the Space Minifigs are just... PERFECT with their gold planet on it.
It is really REALLY a great Lego. Probably one of the best in all history of the Lego Company : concept simple, beaucoup de fun, possibilit&#233;s infinies...

"David1971","2007-03-11T13:12:13.467Z","A perfect set","Ahh, I had this in 1981 when Peter Davison was Doctor Who on telly and i loved space things. This was incredibly cool, I loved the way the lab module locked neatly into the back of the vehicle, which seemed to be a James Bond style level of technical genius. This was a vehicle that really *did* things. Brilliant.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-25T14:13:23.17Z","A Great Classic Space Set","Classic Space fans should have this set by now. However, if they don't, read my review. Although I don't own this, I can predict what it might be like. This set has a great outpost with some radars and some computers. I really like that alot. Onto the vehicle, this thing could conquer any terrain on the moon or on the trails back on Earth. The design is very good too. Overall, this is a very good set to have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"polyester","2009-10-06T13:12:44.217Z","1980s Classic Space perfection.","Back when I was a kid this thing was the ultimate space set.  Not only was it fun to play with (and split into two sets so my sister and I wouldn't have to fight over it), it has tons of key parts which can be used to build completely awesome spaceships.  Big canopies, trans yellow panels, giant rocket engines, space windows, radar dishes, landing legs, tons of computers... they're all here.

There are a few nits to pick:  the astronaut in the back section needs to take his air tanks off (or wear them on his front) to sit in the seat.  Both sections are exposed to the elements.  Those tiny red headlights would be completely useless for night driving.  And why would a ground vehicle need huge rocket engines?

But in general the pluses of this set far outweigh the minuses.  Back in the early 80s this was the primo set to cannibalize for decking out crazy homemade starships.  Ours met the same fate, until I reassembled it a few months ago and gave it to my five-year-old son.  He's just as dazzled by it as I was at his age... wonderful stuff.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-20T17:16:10.92Z","Serious Wheels","I see this vehicle as the land based counterpart to the Star Fleet Voyager(6929).  They both have similar white and blue trans aesthetics with the cocoon canopy on top and bottom.   I was torn between giving this a 3 and a 4 because there are some things I love about it and things that could be improved.  

What I don't like about it is the tight fit in the ""lab"" area.  Barely enough room to sit in the chair, and the computers end up being under the guys feet. And the computers in the back, there is hardly room to stand in there.  There's no back door on the lab either.  I like the flip open roof, which could possible be a solar collector(?) but even with the extra access, it's tough to get your fingers and figures in there for play value.  For the carrier part, I wish they had thrown an extra computer or two in that big empty area behind the driver. And the open cockpit feels wrong to me. Even another 6x2 flat blue trans or a plain white flat would have looked cooler, and you could have ""greebled"" it up a bit.

What I did like was the look of the Carrier.  It has this mean, serious, low to the ground no-nonsense look about it.  It looks very fast with the jet engines and the six wheel design which I find very pleasing. The mechanism for locking the lab into the carrier is a great design and a lot less convoluted than alot of other sets both before and after.  Despite it's cramped size, the lab itself looks very nice with the blue and yellow trans hearkening back to the earliest vintage sets.  It has lots of windows and a trans roof.  Put the two together and you have a unique functional fun vehicle/playset.

What finally tipped me towards the 4 is ultimately, the parts are greater than the whole and this set has a lot of great pieces to build something even more unique.  I only have the one that I bought on ebay recently, but I could see myself augmenting my fleet with a couple more. 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"michaelvader","2010-01-20T18:24:56.653Z","A very good ""old"" set.","I like this set alot. You want to know how I got this? I was not alive in 1981 but My Uncle was. He got A few of these old sets about 20. He gave most of them to me. The rest are in my Grandma's house. Well I found this set on January 17 while I was looking around and I built it there.

the Build: Well the little instruction books back then were like Maga blocks instruction's now. That also proves how bad Maga Blocks are. But I messed up the 1st time but it was easy to fix. 

The Minifigs: you get 1 red astronout and 1 white one. they are pretty cool. The white one has a faded logo.

The set: I like this ALOT! It has old (new to me) wheels. It has blue and yellow trans pieces. But the top is not coverd though. It has lots of new pieces. new controls and NO STICKERS! It also has 2 printed space logos.

I like this set alot so I give this a 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many cool, unique parts you would not find in Lego Town or other themes. The blue windows on the vehicle, the yellow see-through roof with two satellite discs,&nbsp;the computers,&nbsp;the rocket boosters and of&nbsp;course&nbsp;Benny&#39;s two cousins: all cool parts.</p>

<p>Building it was&nbsp;cool I think, but it is just so good looking! And with 2 minifigs, a vehicle and a station, you can play with it even without owning any other space set (but yes, owning more space sets is a plus for sure).</p>
