"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-15T22:16:23.39Z","Yeah, Lots of Wheels","I recently picked this set up and look at it a successor to the early Mobile Lab and Surface Explorer sets sort of mashed together.  The rear ""lab"" area is definitely the highlight of the set.  It has several greebles attached to the front and the rear, which are very vague in their purpose.  I suppose that could be a good or a bad thing.  The cockpit is a little ""eh.""   The wheels are very multitudinous.  The wheels on the set I got stuck quite a bit and didn't actually roll, but I attribute that to production issues (the black cross beams don't turn freely in the blue bricks with holes) and not a design flaw.  I like the fact that the suspension on the vehicle allows for crossing ""terrain"" quite well.

It could have used a little more multi-tasking of later sets like the cockpit maybe detaching and turning into a flying craft or the two halves separating a tad easier for separate play, but overall minor quibbles for a decent set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I will&nbsp;never&nbsp;forget how amazed I was with all the new and unique pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>Fast forward 25+ years and I still have it! I just finished building it after a long, long storage period. Amazingly I only have one piece missing and the instructions are still intact. I&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;built any of my old sets for a very long time and I forgot how different the old LEGO instructions were. The new ones seemed so dumbed down. These ones you have to pay close attention to or you miss adding a crucial piece&nbsp;during&nbsp;the build process.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the details on the set are a bit finicky and can fall of easily if you are not careful, but the&nbsp;overall&nbsp;design is very good. I really wish LEGO would bring back some of these sets from this era. The new space themes leave little to the&nbsp;imagination&nbsp;it seems.</p><p><br></p><p>This set has lots of wheels, full suspension, lots of unique pieces for its time and NO stickers, only painted bricks where needed.</p><p><br></p><p>A classic worth owning! However, I may be biased with my emotional&nbsp;attachment&nbsp;to my first space set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"fclef","2021-10-31T22:09:02.063Z","Finally got it after 25 years","<p>I remember myself&nbsp;as a 9-year-old&nbsp;looking at the picture of this set in 1984 Catalogue that I still own in a very good condition. Unfortunately I haven&#39;t&nbsp;managed to own this set until 2019. I bought it from Bricklink, but some bits were missing (trans red antenna, one&nbsp;trans red shield, one grey dish, one plate 1x4 offset) and stud receptacles of some of the&nbsp;modified plates (aka space wings) were cracked. I recently bought all missing and cracked parts from Bricklink, completed the set. Now it looks like a brand-new set. After 27 years it is still one the best Lego sets ever produced. What more a kid can ask for? 16 wheels, lots of antennas, radar dishes, detectors, jet engines, and the very rare black astronaut.&nbsp;It is also a perfect classic&nbsp;space parts lot for your MOC&#39;s. It has lots of opportunities for play scenarios. And the set itself is&nbsp;the jewel in the crown. I&#39;m glad to be able to add this set to my collection along with 6880 Surface Explorer which is the perfect companion of Uranium Exploration Rover.</p>

"MrMajestical","2019-10-15T21:53:56.82Z","6928 Uranium Search Vehicle","<p>I remember seeing this set in the catalogs I got with other sets I bought in the mid-80&#39;s. My first one was in a large lot of vintage pieces I bought and was about 94% complete. I recently bought one 100% complete with box.</p>

<p>The highlight of the set has to be the Black Astronaut, as it was only in 7 other sets. That alone makes the set worth buying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set consists of 196 elements. There is a good variety of pieces, like 2 metal detectors, hammer, wrench, CB, trans red castle shields/radar dishes, and several trans yellow parts. As well as &quot;gold leafed&quot; planet 1x2&#39;s and printed grill and computer terminal.</p>

<p>The build is fairly simple, altho I have built it a couple times and always leave the 2x4 modified offset piece off the rear unit by the hinge piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability is good, with drivers canopy and rear areas that open. The 16 wheels add realism and stability to the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I said at my opening, the Black Astronaut is the star of the set. There is also a White Astronaut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pricing can be a little steep. I paid $110 for my boxed set. The &quot;gold leaf&quot; parts are perfect, and most bricks are in very good shape. The trans yellow parts are clear and minimally scratched. I looked at other sets in the $40-$80 range. Sealed sets can approach $1,000.</p>

<p>Overall this is probably one of my favorite sets. I would definatly say it&#39;s worth adding to a collection.</p>
