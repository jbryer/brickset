"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-07T14:21:23Z","Another classic","I've got some of the best starships that lego have made - 928 up to the big ice planet one! I remember seeing this one in a catalogue but never asking for one at Christmas. Managed to get one off ebay for a good price. I really like the adjustable nose piece. Its a shame the cockpit doesn't really fit the figure - are you meant to take off the oxygen tank? 

Have subsequently acquired a 6880 and combined to create the super (rubbish) ultra rare ship.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-11T18:21:14Z","a classic","The first large spaceship I can remember owning.  I recently (finally) got all the pieces so I could rebuild it, and what fun it was!  Great design and construction, there's not much I would change.  I especially love how the midsection is in 3 layers, built with small parts and with red lights as accents.  The opening rear area with the boosters and removable supply box, the folding nosecone, and the sleek winged design are just a few highlights on a magnificent example of classic space.

I never got this as a child, and missed not having it.  This set is a perfect complentary (and essential) set for those owning a 928 and 924 in my opinion

A great parts source (use this plus 6880) for the super-rare 1593 spaceship (which can sell for over $360 with instructions!)

This set can be bought cheap at ebay and I've managed to acquire 4 so far, including a boxed one!  It's just too good to pass up! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Or I would turn the cargo box into and escape pod. My favorite thing to do, was to seperate the cockpit from the reas of the ship. Seal off the hole made in the back, and add a landing gear piece under the from nose cone. Now I had a one man star fighter that was super awsome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Skut","2014-09-04T03:55:33.41Z","One of the best Classic Space sets","<p>For a number of years while living out of home, my &quot;on display&quot; Classic Space collection consisted only of 918, 924 and 928.&nbsp; I would be rich if I had a dollar for every time a visitor said something like: &quot;I didn&#39;t have any of those ones when I was a kid, but I had an awesome blue and white Lego spaceship...&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;awesome blue and white Lego spaceship&quot; is, of course, the legendary 6929.&nbsp; This was the flagship of the second generation of Classic Space ships.&nbsp; In looks, I consider it to be equal to or better than the first generation - the &quot;wasp waisted&quot; shape, tilting nose and iridescent trans-blue canopy give this ship the feel of some sort of menacing insect shooting through the blackness of space.&nbsp; This is a ship not to be messed with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a number of little features which add to the play value: the tilting nose is simple but surprisingly fun feature, seemingly inspired by Concorde but, unlike the real thing, doing nothing to assist the pilot&#39;s visibility.&nbsp; The hinged closing mechanism for the rear cargo bay, and the way it latches onto the cargo container, is not exactly innovative but still fun.&nbsp; And of course the larger cargo container itself is a big step forward from 924&#39;s tiny little &quot;space esky&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blue/white colour scheme was used relatively sparsely in the Classic Space line, and this fact makes this set all the more unique.&nbsp; Unfortunately the white parts tend to fade with age, so this ship tends to look a bit tired relative to the first generation ships such as 928.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course the set has a few small drawbacks: only one astronaut; no vehicle and a frustrating lack of visibility straight ahead for the pilot.&nbsp; None of these are enough to offset the perfect &quot;5&quot; rating, though.</p>

<p>A magnificent set and well worth the money of you can pick one up - expect some fading of the white parts though.&nbsp;</p>

"wildwill","2018-11-29T22:32:24.777Z","My Personal Holy Grail and Now I have it Again!","<p>I was gifted this set as a child, probably when it was new, let&#39;s say 1980 or 81, and it was my first Lego Space set ever, and obviously my most favorite.&nbsp; I had my original set for years and may still own some pieces, though over time they have been damaged, and once i even drilled holes into them to simulate battle damage.&nbsp; Ahh youth.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been searching for a decent copy of this set that wouldn&#39;t break the bank for years, and I finally found one and pulled the trigger.&nbsp; All said with shipping I paid just about the price that&#39;s listed to the side for used ($43).</p>

<p>The set was mostly put together and had the original instructions, but I took it apart and quickly remade it, not remembering much about the actual construction.&nbsp; I recall the play features vividly, that opening cockpit, the Concorde type nose swivel and the cargo box, but I couldn&#39;t remember how it was basically a layer cake construction.&nbsp; There&#39;s virtually NO SNOT techniques on display here, it&#39;s a throwback to an earlier time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So swooshable.&nbsp; So much fun!&nbsp; Can&#39;t wait to get it home and join the rest of my collection.</p>

"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-16T21:33:58.67Z","Flagship of the Fleet","This was my second Space set ever and one of only two of the  ""larger"" spacecraft (The FX Patroller being the other) I had so by default it was my fleets' flagship.  It is a very, very sturdy craft with a hefty well built hull.  The storage unit hooks into the back with a clever topcatch mechanism and the blue trans cockpit is a very cool design and totally different from the primarily blue and yellow trans ships up to that point.  The only drawback I can think of is that the ""lasers""  on either side of the cockpit are rather fragile during play and come off, especially the radar dish with the green bulb on the front.  The same goes for the antenna on the front of the craft. Considering how sturdy the rest of the craft is (you'll see what I mean if you're ever fortunate enough to add one to your collection) it's too bad the greebles aren't as sturdy.

Still one of the most unique designs through the years, this is a great set.

"jalex_jason","2010-01-24T19:17:25.75Z","The most time spent flying around the room, in this ship.","This was so good I had a fleet of three of them, lined up on the runways all next to each other. 
They were so versatile, the concorde nose dipped down for landing like the real concorde, and the back doors opened you could build the mini containers and modify them to carry pods with buggys and equipment.
So much fun, so much time, we renamed them on our estate the priate ships, meand my friends together must of own about nine of them together, and spent a lot of time out back, I needed extra runway space for when any came around.
It had a very sturdy frame and took some good crashes and the space guy never fell out and I never thought it weird he had a steering wheel to fly this thing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"GalaxyExplorer928","2019-11-27T17:15:13.323Z","Good, but for me, 928 Galaxy Explorer pips it","<p>I had this set, and there&#39;s much to commend it, the sunken cockpit and transparent under belly piece, the pinched waist in the middle, not to mention&nbsp;the Concorde-style nose.
