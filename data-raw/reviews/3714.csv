"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-22T06:35:31Z","MY FIRST SET","too bad i was way too young(3 years) to appreciate it the first time around, but i recently acquired another one and it still rocks. Lots of unique classic space bits.... ladders, struts, dishes, tools, storage compartments, and 4 vehicles too! Plenty of minifigs for such a small set, in fact more than nearly all late-space sets. The only downside i see is that theres nothing really on the backside and the station would be abandoned if all 4 vehicles were being used... but then again we could ALL use more minifigs, cant we?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-17T04:14:23Z","Better than it first appears","If I had never seen the models on the back of this box, I would have given this set a 7 or 8/10.  This set is difficult to find cheap now, but in the 80's this set would have been great play value because of the baseplate, 4 figures and nice box. 

This set has great versatility, especially when combined with other classic space sets (great for space buggies/trailers and rockets!)

Sits proudly with a variety amongst a variety of classic, unitron, and space police craft. The little hover craft are brilliant. The other good thing - it came with about 5 blue figures that the seller chucked into the deal! Great!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-04T21:34:05.95Z","A classic base.","This brings back many happy memories.  My nana got me it for Christmas many years ago.  It comes with plenty of vehicles (two ground buggys and two little hovercraft, all well-designed) as well as a control room with computers and the like.  Interesting use of those webbed radar dishes and lots of useful pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bcrookston","2009-10-15T19:04:36.2Z","Hour after Hour after Hour...","Although not the first Lego set, I certainly got a lot of mileage out of this one.  I used to spend hours playing with it, searching for minerals, exploring, base activities, and a rescuing lost spacemen.  Brings back many good memories.  I remember having the instructions memorized, which was a good thing as they became so used and worn that they were very difficult to read.  (They have since been replaced with a crisp new set!).  In my opinion this space set represents exactly what a Lego set should be. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Speninator","2009-08-29T16:44:23.28Z","awesome awesomme awesome!!","   This set, as I said before, is awesome! It includes 4 figures, and four vehicles. Two hover crafts and two buggys or rovers, or whatever you want to call them. There are two people in red and two in yellow, and there is an area where you can take off two figures air tanks, store them in the storage area, and seat them at the controls.

FIGS: these people are nice, and much better looking than the space police 3 or mars mission, beacause, the only gear they have are the tanks, they have helmets, of course, and even though there are places for visors, they don't have any. the torso has a space logo, and I guess this evolved into the mars mission logo.

HOVERCRAFTS: These vehicles, are very us3eful, allowing our inch high friends to access unbelievable heights above the planet. it can store a radio and a radar, it is driven by a steering wheel and has two laser blasters. I don't see why they have these, because this was before aliens existed. it has a sick at the back to contact the base , but I don't see why this was included, if it has a radio.

SMALL VEHICLE: This car is very small and could be a set on it's own. it has four 
all terrain wheels,a storage area in the back to store any thing that'll fit, and this car has two small holes in the back to keep a mineral detector in and a radar can be stored here as well.

LARGE VEHICLE
This is a little larger than the other car, and can turn, with the rare hinge piece. The front half of the vehicle is very boring, all it is is a steering wheel on a 2x4 with a hinge with wheels on the bottom, but the trailer is much better. it has a laser gun that is stored with an ax and it even has a place to store your minerals.

BUILDING: The building included in this set is the main feature. first off it includes an area to park all of your vehicles, it has four radars to scan the surface of the planet, and it has several sticks for communication,and it has a place with two seats, and two control panels and two places to keep your airtanks when you sit in the chairs , and it has two pieces of clear plastic that can open and close to put in the figures


You have to get this set if you don't have it already, even if you don't have any lego land space sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-18T09:25:44.5Z","Exponential Play Factor","When you have 4 vehicles, 4 MiniFigs AND a homebase to have them leave and return to, the possibilites are indeed endless.  This was my first actual baseplate set when I was little, and it did not disappoint.  The two ground vehicles are different enough from each other for a wide variety of ""missions""  and the little hovorcraft are very cool, small spacecraft.  

The base itself has a proto-Futuron look to it with the white and blue trans motif, as well as the blue struts which were the basis of many a MOC moonbases when I was a kid. 

For a ""base"" set is has relatively few pieces, but they are utilized to such a maximum effect in the set, the whole thing seems grander than it actually is. Lots of playability here.  Very very highly recommended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-10-21T11:30:03.203Z","LOST TO THE VOID?!","This Space set was/is a wonderful set that was much admired and probably requested by many, my siblings and I included.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>Ketchup or mustard? Thats right its red or yellow, two of each.</li></ul></div><div><b>Moon Base</b></div><div>The attractions were many; multiple coloured spacemen, mini and medium vehicles, hover pad style craft, a control centre, exploratory equipment, radar dishes, a material collection point and the all important moon rock base with its brilliant craters.</div><div><br></div><div>The bricks involved to build this shared wonder (we managed not to fight too much) were interesting and diverse- weird space theme brought weird space bricks. The real stand out part is the blue stantions. These work fine unless, over years, you grind them in a box of broken down sets. Their destruction was in our case sadly inevitable but they remain bent and exist I am sure, around the old boxes. The buggy wheels were always adorably fat and perfect for the vehicle purpose; the high rolling buggy goes anywhere with a set of these on.</div><div><br></div><div>Watch out for too many moon buggy trips wearing down the edges of those craters, we obviously loved this layout and so gave it hell overtime! The construction ub from that crater base is very skeletal to an extent. It is essentially a platform for two airlock cockpits and two craft launch pads.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The two buggies include a more industrial type for collecting rock samples and an excellent little speedster close to Apollo mission types. The two hovercraft are inspired simplicity being built on the back of face down radar dishes. Thats it, stick on a steering wheel and an aerial and its almost ready to go!</div><div><br></div><div>Red and green lights adorn the station and vehicles while an accessory features in the shape of a scanner with a red light stud for the imagination to provide a flash for.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Far Out</b></div><div>There actually is not a huge amount to this build and imagination can only fill in for a lack of form, no bad thing in my opinion but finding this set now could prove difficult or costly. I think smaller, cheaper Space sets with good minifigure torso prints are worth more than a complete expensive set like this with wrecked/scraped parts.&nbsp;It does though remain a really great station set for the early Space theme and has a warm place in many hearts no matter how battered the poor old thing became.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"tone76","2010-11-28T02:32:39.943Z","One of the all time classic LEGO Space sets!","This is one of the all time greats from the LEGO Space line.&nbsp; It doesn't have a lot of pieces, but what it does with those pieces is exceptional.&nbsp; 2 space craft, 2 ground buggies, 4 minifigs and a structure where all vehicles can be safely parked once play is finished for the day.&nbsp; It doesn't get much better than this.&nbsp; <br><br>The design itself is timeless - the cool radar and satellite dishes, along with the neat computer consoles located in the office with those really neat blue tinted windows, still look pretty futuristic and space-like in 2010.&nbsp; <br><br>As I pointed out before, there's not a lot of pieces, but it still takes a fair while to build as there is a ground station + 4 vehicles to put together.&nbsp; With all those vehicles, this set is VERY playable, as my 4 year old son can attest to.&nbsp; 6930 has quickly become his favourite LEGO set!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"T79","2015-06-19T10:07:34.24Z","More than the sum of its parts","<p>At about 200 parts this must be one of the smallest bases in the entire &quot;space&quot; range, it is a lot smaller than for example #6972 Polaris I Space Lab. That doesn&#39;t have to stop the fun though, quite on the contrary!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Your standard &quot;bigger set&quot; booklet at about letter size or slightly smaller with a photograph of the set on the front page, all other pages are taken up by the instructions on the regular space dunes background. The small size of the base is accentuated by the low number of steps required to build it: 12, by comparison you first spend 6 (small ground vehicle) + 8 (larger ground vehicle) + 7 x 2 (flying vehicles) = 28 steps to build the small vehicles included. Strangely, the instructions for the vehicles tell you to add the minifigures while they are put together only once you start on the base itself.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There may not be a huge amount of parts in this set but those that are included sure are nice! Four gray webbed 6 x 6 radar dishes and two smaller 4 x 4 dishes, sixteen blue round 2 x 2 bricks, eight of those&nbsp;tall blue supports, two trans dark blue 6 x 4 x 2 canopies, eight&nbsp;balloon tyres, four 1 x 2 bricks in white with a black grille print, four blue and two gray antennae, some 2 x 2 x 2 containers, more printed parts (computers, arrows, classic space logo)... A veritable treasure trove of space parts! And of course a crater baseplate, when did you ever have enough of these? Another part to mention are two of those inverted, hollow&nbsp;2 x 3 slope bricks with towball which did not come in many sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For a base this small a rather generous supply of four classic spacemen, two yellow and two red. They also come with a good&nbsp;cache of tools: a small axe, a metal detector, a loudhailer, five torches / space guns, two radios and a camera / bazooka. No shortage of equipment here!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Well, this is where the set is lacking a bit, especially since it&#39;s supposed to be a base. The two ground vehicles are basically #6823 Surface Transport split in two with some other parts added (in fact, #6823 fits nicely in this station too) and are decidedly bare. Especially the front of the larger vehicle consists of a steering wheel and nothing else. The two flying vehicles are nice though, a lesson in simplicity and still interesting. And then there is the station itself which is ready before you know it, all there is to it is setting up pylons supporting a layer of plates with a few bricks and slopes added to the mix. Even the control room is not exactly challenging or even interesting, at least the designers set the chairs back so the astronauts can sit down without taking of their air supply (this was a set&nbsp;from before those space chair brackets I assume).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks decidedly bigger than&nbsp;the small part count would suggest but that is mainly because it is set high on those pylons, take out the pylons and it becomes painfully obvious just how small this &quot;base&quot; is. But where this set shines is in playability (even though those old plates with round clip broke if you did as much as look at them), with four vehicles to scurry to and fro you have plenty of options to mount survey missions, rescue teams, mining&nbsp;operations&nbsp;or even a combat squad!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>So don&#39;t let part count and size fool you, sometimes good things come in small packages! The multitude of options ensures that the kids like it a lot too even now, 30 years later.</p>
