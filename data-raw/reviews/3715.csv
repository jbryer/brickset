The little rover is very cool and useful in exploring unknown territory. The robot is good too. Nothing is bad about this and will make a Space fan happy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-10T13:24:13.56Z","fun midsize set","This year had a plethora of well designed sets.  This probably was the best of them.  Similarly to the Galaxy Commander, this set's front end could separate, but used the connector piece, which practically became a standard in Lego for adding a sense of modularity to their sets.

The rear was kinda neat since the wings were built on flaps, adding a bit of playability.  The new hoses in this series added more detail to the space craft along with the arrow pieces that started from this year.  Most importantly, the rear could lift up, revealing a small wheeled patrol vehicle, in which a little robot scooted around lunar terrain.

The robot was another nice element that this year presented.  The previous year saw the Robotic HQ, giving hint of Lego's attention towards robots.  In this series, there were a few sets that had little robots you could build.  Here, we saw the new arm-like pieces, antennae/controls and head piece.

Really wonderful set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ra226","2012-01-28T00:29:33.69Z","My all time favorite, a classic from the past","<p>This is simply my all time favorite lego set. &nbsp;I still remember Mom letting me choose between it and the Gamma-V (6891) while at Toys R Us. &nbsp;I of course wanted the Gamma-V too, but I&#39;ve never regreted choosing the FX over it--the FX still has more play value with the roller stashed in the rear section. &nbsp;This set, more often than most, is what ended up coming with me on the car trips to grandma&#39;s house (I&#39;d &quot;fly&quot; it as we drove down the highway).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great looking ship, with nice lines and styling (and actually has a lot in common with the Gamma-V). &nbsp;The rear wings have a slight downward tilt which is very elegant. &nbsp;When separated, the front section looks great by itself. &nbsp;I always imagined ditching the rear, perhaps leaving it in orbit when you had to make a fast get away. &nbsp;Like several other ships of this era, the nose piece could &quot;detach&quot; (I suppose it wasn&#39;t really designed to be, but it just begs for it) and become a mini-spy while the rest of the ship stays hidden around the back side of a moon.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Modular design: Front and rear ship sections, Robot, Roller, Minifig</li>
	<li>Good color scheme, well representative of Classic Space</li>
	<li>Great, classic details--the missiles on the tail, plenty of engines &amp; transparent pieces</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Mom made me choose between it and the Gamma-V.</li>
</ul>

<p>This set is just an absolute classic.&nbsp; In terms&nbsp;of Classic Space, it has it all: color scheme, suspiciously missile-shaped thrusters, transparent dishes, a robot, modular design, hoses in illogical places, and if you like tiles with arrows on them, boy are you in for a treat!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved this set, it&#39;s just perfect in every way.&nbsp; Not too big to take on a car trip, not too small as to get boring quickly.&nbsp; It&#39;s fast, fun, and great looking. &nbsp;Oh, and this story has a happy ending: when I got to college, I bought the Gamma-V on Bricklink.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-04-01T17:58:24.34Z","Wonderful larger set, but maybe not the best investment ","<p>So this set is comparable in length to the Cosmic Fleet Voyager 6985, offers many of the same features, but uses half the bricks. That said, it is still my largest Classic Space set after 6985, and my next largest ship is half the size.</p>

<p>Among the similarities to 6985, it can separate into front and back, and the back portion has a garage door that holds a lunar buggy. The main difference however is that it isn&rsquo;t so bulky and lacks the large interior that can hold numerous minifigures. As a result, despite its size, it is still a single minifigure ship, although you can hold another minifigure&nbsp;on the lunar buggy, the robot that comes with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>This set comes with a very good selection of classic space parts. Lots of printed parts, especially arrows. While there are a lot of angled plates, the set only has a few large plates, making it difficult to build more robust ships. The only large brick is the one that connects the front and back portions of the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Design</b></p>

<p>the ship looks great with both sections combined, and the front section looks great on its own as well. The back section however does not hold up to well on its own, instead it looks rather awkward with the large connecting beam sticking out of it. And unlike the back portion of 6985 which can be turned into a lunar base once you land, the back portion of this ship is just to small and ship-like to serve a similar purpose. For this reason I hardly ever took this ship apart.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I do like this ship a lot, although for a set of this size, it would have been nice if it could accommodate another minifigure or two. The detachability of the ship isn&rsquo;t too useful so for a pice count of this size, I feel it would have been better to have a shorter ship but with more interior space. While the length is impressive, it unfortunately reduces the playability of a set of this size. This is a set I own from my childhood, but if you are looking to pick up a larger Classic Space set I&rsquo;m not sure that the playability of this set could justify the price. 6872 would be much cheaper, comes with a robot, and is very similar in size to the front of this ship. Maybe instead buy that cheaper set and save up for 6895 which will offer you everything you could ever dream of in a Classic Space set.&nbsp;</p>
