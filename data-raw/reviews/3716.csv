"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-06T12:06:14Z","Small detail, but important!","   First, I love the design of this set.  It's highly origonal I like the two escape pods design.  It also is a grest fighter, it's bristling with guns.  But, I'm only giving it a nine because of a small detail that bugs me, though.  How do they drive this thing?   If they control the ship through the pods like in Aerial Intruder, where are the controls?  Even a keypad brick on the sides of the pods would do it.  Also, in the '88 catalogue and in the picture, it shows a futuron spaceman in the middle when the rover is dispathced.  But the computer brick is out of reach! However, I can attach the controls from the rover to the main section, but then the rover just becomes a 2x4 on wheels.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"SweetBoy","2005-08-04T07:58:45Z","Classically Simple","Complaining about lack of controls? The Millennium Falcon had no joystick or control wheel, just the hyperspace lever!!  This set was the best of the Futuron series, itself one of my favourite themes.  The detatchable pods, the dinky little rover, the space men with visors, it provided hours of fun and entertainment",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zzoreil","2006-11-16T06:18:00Z","Wonderful!!","<p>I got this set in 1989 as a christmas gift and he quickly became one of my favourite. Now i have three of them (maybe 4) and i add a panel brick in the main cockpit.<br />
But everything else is perfect : the main part is really well designed, with or without the two cockpits, and these two cockpits are one of the best ideas the lego designers ever had! The colors are beautiful. The big trans-blue cockpit is amazing.<br />
&quot;Stardefender 200&quot; is in french the &quot;Triple Vaisseau Modulable&quot; and i like this name too.</p>

"krysto2002","2008-07-20T15:15:08.153Z","A true match for the aerial intruder","Suprisingly similar to the Blacktron II set, this is in my opinion the Futuron flagship. The fact that the pods detach and attach to one another is great!! The overall design is nice and has few flaws, but the flaws I'm talking about are what separates this from being 5/5. The most annoying flaws are that the main window opens only oh-so-far and if pushed to hard, comes off! Also, the most annoying problem in my opinion, and where the set loses its playability, is that the cockpit in the center, which I use for the rover, does not have an entrance large enough for a minifigure OR the rover to come in. This would be much better if there was a loading ramp and a hole large enough to fit a minifigure into it! Otherwise a great set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-08-28T18:13:52.497Z","Best looking Ship","<p>This is the best looking ship of all the space themes in history.<br />
It is my only futuron set, I hope to be able to have some day the monorail.<br />
The two space pods are good and were new when it where introduced in the 80s.<br />
The small car is simple but great and can be carried it in the back of the ship with the two yellow futuron minifigures.<br />
Overall a great set</p>

"dim","2010-03-19T14:34:54.31Z","'The Revenge of the Futuron'","<p>This was by far my favorite set when I was a child; I still remember when, ten years old, I opened for the first time a 1987 catalogue and I made my first acquaintance with the new Futuron line and then I saw the Stardefender 200. I had such a strong surge of excitement that I still haven’t forgotten, over 20 years later.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This set has a very unique shape; it looks directly out of a Star Wars movie. At that time it was completely different from any other configuration presented by Lego Space; it was based on the massive transparent blue panels that arrived fresh with the new theme. In this case this panel is placed horizontally and spans over almost the entire length of the spaceship to form the fuselage in a similar way to the smaller 6884 - Aero Module. However in this set the idea is more complete; the cockpit appears airtight (it’s not entirely in reality) and on either side of the main body, instead of wings, there are two detachable, roughly octagonal pods (similar to a TIE-Fighter cockpit) that can be attached to each other to create a smaller flyer. This configuration gives to the spacecraft unique proportions; it is much wider than it is long. Generally the design is very well proportioned with the front blasters at the correct height in relation to the canopy and the pods at the correct distance from the main body. The spaceship is rather heavily armed for a Futuron set. Apparently, as the name also reveals, this was thought as the defensive machine of the Futuron against the Blacktron until the Space Police would arrive. Particularly the black lasers on the sides of the fuselage with the external pipes look very neat.<br/>The set comes with two yellow Futuron astronauts that can occupy the twin pods and a tiny rover which fits in the main body. The problem with this configuration is that the pods are devoid of any controls whereas the only controls of the spacecraft are in the main cockpit. Which leads to the conclusion that the rover should pilot this machine…? This issue needs a bit of imagination to be resolved. The rover itself is nothing special but at least it comes with joysticks that look more space-like than the steering wheels used in older space sets.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Pros:<br/><br/></strong>Beautiful and unique shape, extremely successful proportions<br/>Good playability for its size<br/>Good parts for alternative models<br/><br/><strong>Cons:<br/></strong><br/>Not entirely airtight cockpit<br/>Lack of controls in the pods, hard to reach controls in the main cockpit<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/>This set is in my opinion the most characteristic of its subtheme and one of my favorite Lego Space sets ever. Minor complaints about the lack of controls cannot change the fact that this is a true gem of its time. I think Lego Space should look back again to such designs.<br/>It was also the set that triggered my renewed interest in Lego. I had to find it in my old toys after it was brought up in a discussion with a friend; every time I look at it I become ten years old again.<br/>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"andy87","2009-06-21T22:01:17.937Z","One of the better futuron sets","Many of the futuron sets leave a lot to be deisred compared to other themes at the time (blacktron and space police) but this one hits the mark! First of all, the shape is unique and it has blue domes which give a nice touch. It also has plenty of guns and is therefore well defeneded and includes and driod and two minifigs.

The only thing that bothers me is that futuron is supposed to be helpless (which is why the space police protect them from blacktron) so why does this ship have weapons?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
