I think it is a good set, with great playability.
 
I like the 6 big tires, the 4 spring-suspension, and the special yellow glasses. These are all very rare. The car could be steered with the rocket at the back. The vehicle can be combined in many different ways, as it consists of 3 main parts. Without the top black-and-yellowish part, its looking even more good. 
If you have 6957 space police set also, that is the greatest!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

THe schocks are pretty cool as well but the back pair needed them also.  I like that it comes with two figures instead of one and that the front cocpit bulb can detach.  THe sattelite is also decent.  The top of the vehicle is pretty cool with the cargo pod and the other figure at the extra controls.  I can't see any major problems with this set, so get if the chanse comes by.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-24T20:11:02.513Z","A well-designed set.","A six-wheeled vehicle, this set's cockpit (one of those nice-looking globe-shaped things) detaches to form a smaller craft.  There is also a detachable ground base on the back, and a unique feature which involves steering it via a rocket booster at the far end.  Functional and nice-looking set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"andy87","2009-06-26T23:24:13.53Z","hmm...this one has me thinking","this is one of the blacktron two sets that wasn't bad!

Pros: Well it has a nice design, and i've always loved the large wheels. It also includes TWO minifigures which is better then the blacktron one sets that only had one. It resembles a giant rovor in my eyes, i also like the cockpits.


Cons: the antenaes go up a little two high, and i say this on every blacktron two review, but the blacktron one minifigure was much better (these aren't even black, making the name very odd)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BrickPiet44","2008-12-30T06:54:17.967Z","Best Blacktron set, great playing, with riding and flying parts","This is my favourite Blacktron set. A lot of pro’s. no serious con’s.

Pro’s:
- Vehicle consists of three different parts. There’s a driving part (with the big wheels), a small flying set and a top set with a sort of laboratory. The three sets can be combined in different ways. 
- This gives a very high rate of playability. It can be used as a driving vehicle but also as a flying vehicle, and in different combinations!
- Four of the six wheels have shock absorbers. This works well.
- Two minifigs.
- Nice colour scheme.
- Good design, with parts use in inventive ways. Look at the front part, and the top part (“lab”) that can be opened to put a minifig in or to use the storage box.
- Steering of the driving set at the back.

Con’s:
- Two of the wheels do not have shock absorbers. 
- General con of Blacktron II series: different colour scheme from Blacktron I series.
A solution for this problem is to give all sets from Blacktron I and Blacktron II the same colour scheme. I took the white from Blacktron II out, added yellow to Blacktron II and added dark grey to I and II to give a uniform look. Works very well!!

"James83","2017-08-03T13:38:09.447Z","Appearances can be Deceiving","<p>I must admit that I was always disappointed with this set. It came out one year after M-Tron&#39;s&nbsp;6989 Mega Core Magentiser/Mobile Recovery Centre (presumably the Blacktron&#39;s got envious)&nbsp;but this set is not a patch on the larger 6989. It has several really good features but they are let down by poor design.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The vehicle comprises three parts; a cockpit section that can be removed as a spaceship or joined to the centre section pod to make a larger spaceship and the main chassis.</p>

<p>The cockpit looks great, with its bug-eye canopy with a three&nbsp;opening sections so seating the figure is easy. The controls are a Space chainsaw brick and behind are two thruster units and a fin with a radar dish on top. Despite being detachable this section is doesn&#39;t wobble when on the ground. It can be used either as a small spacecraft on its own or connected with the pod stowed in the middle of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The pod looks great&nbsp;but has some flaws. The two side hatches&nbsp;with their integral window frames look cool and give a real airlock vibe. The rear wall and roof open to give further access, the back door having two handy rocket nozzles as handles. The top door also features a handy arrow brick to tell you which way to pull! However, it&#39;s still tricky to place a minifigure inside as its so confined and the floor is quite deep and opening and closing&nbsp;the container door with your fingers is also difficult. The other disappointment is that the pod contains nothing but a container with a M-Tron&nbsp;computer provided as cargo inside. The pod is detachable from the chassis and is sturdy and easy to re-attach. Combined with the cockpit section the two parts make a large spaceship which can be flown by hand without fear of the two parts coming apart.</p>

<p>The chassis is very sturdy and rewarding to build as it features a steering for the rear wheels controlled by a rocket nozzle at the back. The four forward wheels have a neat integrated&nbsp;suspension brick which was quite rare and new for this set. However, I often found these were stiff so the wheels never moved unless the model was pressed hard. Two clips for the hand-held radios is a neat touch but I really found it odd that so much of the vehicle was taken up by the grid at the rear. This holds another chainsaw brick as a secondary control position but to me this should have been a landing platform for smaller mini-craft. Once the spaceship elements are detached the ground vehicle has no tools or elements It&#39;s odd that there are no computer control panels other than the stolen M-Tron unit inside the container.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Two standard Blacktron&nbsp;figures with airtanks&nbsp;and two&nbsp;hand-held radios.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This set looks great and promises so much but compared to the M-Tron&nbsp;6989 this lacks playability. By combining a spaceship and land vehicle you think that&#39;s going to be&nbsp;twice the fun but really the spaceship is the main playable aspect and the six-wheel chassis just feels like a means to drive around if the Blacktron&#39;s&nbsp;run out of rocket fuel. I added a few computer bricks to this set but mainly I used the two space ship elements and the chassis was broken down for other own-built models. The set does come with several interesting bricks that were quite rare so that does add some value.&nbsp;</p>

"Plasmarelais","2017-05-29T22:28:33.357Z","Great Blacktron II Set with one minor issue","<p>As the reviewer said before it is indeed a great set, that no serious collection of Blacktron II should miss. So I&#39;d not repeat what has been told truth.</p>

<p>Pros for me:</p>

<ul>
	<li>brings the modular concept of BT2 ahead for it comes with the pod like some other sets of that theme, enhanced by some type of cargo pod that can be attached on the standard pod or the vehicle itself. Great idea!</li>
	<li>works with a steering, that uses a minimum of technic parts, brilliant. like it even more that the steering system in&nbsp;6896&nbsp;Celestial Forager or&nbsp;6895&nbsp;Spy Trak.</li>
</ul>

<p>Con for me:</p>

<ul>
	<li>lack of compatibility with the other pods from other sets. Playing with this set along with 6887 Allied Avenger and 6988 Alpha Centauri Outpost, we figured that the pods from 6988 won&#39;t fit on the lower connector while they go well on the upper connector of this vehicle. A minor issue, but it puts a little shade on the brilliance of the theme&#39;s modular concept&nbsp;</li>

"wellyred","2017-01-02T03:53:06.773Z","6 wheels","<p>One of the 1st set that always comes to mind when i think about really loving lego as a kid is the Spectral starguider. Not that I knew the name till I hunted it down on here. Too me it was just one the big 6 wheel blacktron set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What most clearly sticks in my mind with this set is playability. From the time I made this set on Christmas day till the time I finally took it apart it must have been months and months if not a year of joy. The way the cockpit and main cabin disconnected and could be connect as a separate spaceship I thought was the best thing ever. The other thing i loved was the shock absorbers on the front and back wheels. They have been re used in endless mocs. Same goes for the big wheels and door/hatch elements.Not as minifigure heavy or diverse as you would expect now and fairly low on the piece count for its size. It&#39;s from another era of lego though and that is to be expected.</p>

<p>It is a set I&nbsp;often consider rebuilding. Just too see if it lives up to the memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great set with a lot of memories attached.</p>
