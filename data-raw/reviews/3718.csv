"Ovid07","2007-07-19T10:30:57.06Z","Let's detect some scorpions!","This set may not look look much, but after you build it, you come to like its array of gizmos and gadgets.  I mean it has so many it could detect a scorpion from a mile away! First off there's the main vehicle unit, with a cool cockpit and arms (don't forget the &quot;detectors&quot;).  Then behind it is a trailer with a giant telescope on it. Overall I give it a 8 out of 10. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-10T19:36:16.03Z","worth while","i dont get why brickset has people review 1737 seperate from this one. there is no difference in the pieces like some sets. anyway, this set is awesome! it is shaped like a scorpion with the arms being the claws and the telescope being the tail. its cool how you can store the fossils in the back and the control panel is awesome. the piece that supports the telescope is really cool because it can also be used as a booster. also the stickers are cool and the cockpit holder (the piece that goes around it is cool too). also the 2 antenna can be the scorpions well... antenna if folded out. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ClassicLegosAreBetter","2011-03-03T23:36:59.05Z","One of the Sleekest and Most Equipped Space Tanks","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Front Pulling Tank:</span> Extremely sleek and powerful looking. Although while I have the 6938 version box, my box shows the arms for the tank to be 1 brick wide and have 1 x 4 white smooth tiles covering them. Even the pictures on the bottom and side of the box if you look closely you will see the arms are just 1 brick wide and the 2 arm pieces are stacked on top of each other. Also the lenses and magnet apparatuses are assembled differently than the way they are in the instructions.(look closely)<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Back Laser/Telescope Trailer: </span>At first when I saw that giant super laser looking thing on the back it always looked like it would be a good ""drill"" to find the alien fossils as it would easily slice through rock. And if that is what it does to rock, just think what it could do to an attacking 6915 Warp Wing Fighter trying to ambush it from above! However according to the official Lego description it is a telescope. Which would make more sense to be honest as the Exploriens are supposed to be civilian futuristic astronauts. None-the-less it is equipped with a decent amount of lasers to a make a dreaded opposing Blacktron tank think twice before striking.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Minifigs:</span> Classic lego looking space guys unlike those very wierd new Space Police 3 figures. Looking at these brilliant minifigs brings back those nostalgic late 90s memories, when lego was in its glory days.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Overall: </span>I much prefer a classic lego box to the open ""container"" type of box you get in 1737. So this is the set to get if you ask me, although the bottom and side pictures of the tank's arms are a bit confusing, this set is a brilliant 90s lego masterpiece! Equipped with lasers and armor the Space Police tanks will definitely have a little help if the Blacktron tanks should try to attack this civilian tank!<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"charliebucket","2016-06-10T00:52:04.847Z","One of my favourite 90's space sets","<p>I got this sealed from&nbsp;Bricklink!!! :D</p>

<p>Now, onto the review.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The &nbsp;box was smaller than I expected with the System logo on one side and the Exploriens logo on the other side. &nbsp;The back shows one of the action features and 4 alternate build&nbsp;ideas. Opening the box you will find a cardboard slide&nbsp;out with&nbsp;3 bags that are not numbered, 2 sticker sheets,&nbsp;some loose parts, the instructions,&nbsp;the catalog, the order form and a poster&nbsp;(handle all with extreme care). &nbsp;The instructions have the box art on one side and 2 alternate builds on the other. &nbsp;The instructions are pretty&nbsp;straight forward to follow with a nice design for the background. &nbsp;The poster is really a bunch of ads for the sets but it has a nice retro feel.&nbsp; The order form does what it says... until December 31&nbsp;1996.&nbsp; Anyway the catalog is great and (even&nbsp;though&nbsp;I was not born back then) kind of nostalgic.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set has 196 parts which is not that great but most people&nbsp;nowadays would not buy this for parts. It does have some old and rare parts - probably the only two&nbsp;of note was the windscreen piece for the cockpit&nbsp;and the magnet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The 2 minifigs&nbsp; are not the most detailed in the world, but the old feel of them is so nice ( but you should just get them from&nbsp;Bricklink by themselves not with the set if you do not want the model).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Does not take long (it&#39;s no modular!) but is still a good build none the less. &nbsp;It took me about half an hour to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks so nice. I&nbsp;like every aspect of it, but my favorite part has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the magnetic stickers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It costs a lot to get it sealed from&nbsp;Bricklink but it is&nbsp;worth every cent!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this helps you choose your next Lego set!</p>
