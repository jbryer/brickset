"brickzone","2007-05-06T09:52:02.513Z","Flying saucer is my cup of tea","It's not everyone's cup of tea, but I like the black and red colour scheme. I'm not sure the transparent blue is best shown off against these colours, but it is a good colour in itself for the canopies/lasers/dishes.

The construction of this saucer is clever, it has a mechanism allowing the two halves to snap apart a crack, allowing the little buggy carried in the ship to land. You can very easily lower the ship onto the buggy again and snap it closed. Then there's the cool &quot;claw&quot; that expands out from the saucer. This uses an interesting custom &quot;arm&quot; and a sleeve part for it which the arm ratchets along.

As far as I'm concerned, this is how a Lego &quot;flying saucer&quot; should be, rather than those UFO sets with large pieces. The pieces used for this set are very versatile; the black and red flat L-shaped boards in this can be used as floors etc. in buildings for example. This set is underrated, you should be able to get hold of one easily and it is great as is for a spaceship, or just even for the reasonable amount of useful space parts in good colours.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Tanager","2007-10-19T14:29:08.937Z","Excellent spaceship, good parts, very creative design, fun build","This is a really nice set.  I don't believe the Spyrius theme ever had a really big ship a la Deep Freeze Defender, etc., but as the &quot;flagship&quot; vehicle set of this line, it doesn't come up sort, in my opinion.  The design is highly creative - a very sturdy (deceptively so) ship that will split cleanly down the middle, but only so much, to allow a small wheeled scooter to be released for, say, exploration.  The ship doesn't tend to come apart just from being looked at, something I had feared (that seems to be all too common), and when together, it's really sturdy - I can let my 3 year-old play with it mostly w/o fear, as long as I don't mind reattaching the antennae (I don't).  I agree with an earlier reviewer that the dark blue canopies aren't necessarily set off against the red/black color scheme, but that doesn't bother me overly - it gives the ship a sleek, dark look that wouldn't have been there with, say, trans-neon-green windscreens.

I also have to agree with the comment of both prior reviewers that the piece selection is excellent - lots of useful pieces, and if you have a really big collection, you might even be able to build this out of your spare parts bins, b/c there are pretty much no parts unique to the set.  It's very anti-4Juniors and just a nice set overall with tons of both play and build value.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2009-02-08T16:46:10.34Z","Excellent surprise","I am a big Lego fan and especially Classic space fan.

I don’t have any set from the Spyrius theme but searching in E-Bay for classic space set I found this set for only 2.5 pounds, I put a bid on it and forgot all about this set.
3 days latter I was the owner of one of these sets, to be honest  I was very busy at the time and didn’t  built the set for two months.
Today I finally built it, and what a great surprise, the set is excellent, it has a very interesting and clever mechanism to insert the space car into the ship that I have never seen before.

The color scheme is great and the form of the ship is the best, it deserve a big 5+ as a review.

I don’t like to much the other Spyrius sets therefore I don’t think that I am going to buy more of these, however this set is excellent and it deserve a good place inside my space collection.

"DVDWow","2008-06-06T13:57:08.827Z","A Superb Medium-Size Spacecraft","I remember the Spyrius Saucer Centurion from 1994 because of it's sleek design, and it's neat dual cockpit design. It was an easy decision to purchase this from eBay to relieve the set that I adored in my childhood, and is really a brilliant design by LEGO.

First off, the set comes with both a Spyrius pilot and a Robot on his buggy-thing. Both are great minifigs, and are a lot of fun to play with. The set also comes with a ton of great bricks in Red and Black, along with 8 jets, 4 antennas and more. All and all, there are a ton of great bricks in this set, and are a great value because none are specificly Spyrius pieces, so they can be reused in any other theme.

The build of this one is pretty good overall. A few parts for me were tough to get together without some figiding. Though the overall design is extremly sturdy, surprisingly so. Given some of the recent LEGO sets, I sort of expected this one to fall apart with some play, but it will not come apart unless you pull it apart (to release the buggy), and makes this set extremely playable.

I personally made a few (very simple) alterations to this set. For one, I switched the Antennas (the ones facing back and up) to face straight forward to act as 2 additional lasers. I found they fell off too easily facing backwards, and facing foward make the set look more aerodynamic. The more substantial, yet easy, alteration is removing the buggy and using a 4x12 red plate to make the two sides of the ship identical, and not have the wheels sticking down. Overall, I like to keep the buggy seperate and use this set just as a dual cockpit spaceship.

Overall, this is just a great, fun set made out of traditional LEGOs (you could probably build everything but the arm (which you could replace with another set of lasers) if you have a fairly big set to begin with. Additionally, there's a lot of opportunity to expand this set and add onto it due to it's design structure. All and all, a well-deserved 5/5 for this set.

"spursfan2690","2008-07-25T23:54:25.873Z","Great Memories","My dad bought this set for me when i was 4, and i still remember building it with him
though i broke it and made other things with it, i still have the pieces and the memories i had with it.
As im packing up all my legos to stow away, not sell or give away, its nice to sit back and remember the good times i had with my legos.
I didnt remember what this one was called so i had to literally browse through this whole section of about 9 pages until i found it.
This set introduced me to the great world of legos and i truly am greatful i started off my lego building with this set.
What an amazing ship for 1994, i still can't believe i got this set 14 years ago, its hard to imagine
The ship was fun to make and if you're a true lego fan and had a chance to get this set, though highly unlikely, perhaps ebay, i would recommend it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brixton","2009-09-06T17:12:20.25Z","Attack of the Flying Saucers","There are many things that lego got right with this set.  The flying saucer itself is amazing and contains a lot of interesting pieces that you don't usually find in typical sets.  The large red and black pieces that make up the saucer are unique to this theme and give the ship a sorta round shape.  The only problem with those pieces is that I can't find any use for them in building other things.  The ship looks very menacing, loaded with weapons and engines.  The ability of the cockpit to open and close is a nice feature.  Too bad there isn't another minifigure for the second cockpit.  

The arm on the space craft is another nice addition as it can be used to pick up objects.  I also love the computer screen like pieces and the navigation piece included in this set.  The rover is sturdy and contains 4 sets of wheels.  Very useful if you want to build a lot of cars.  The minifigures in this set are great.  The pilot of the saucer has a cool looking gun while the robot is a nice addition.  The first time I've encountered a robot minifigure.  The uniqueness of the robot makes the set worthwhile.

"James83","2017-08-25T14:19:31.863Z","Spyrius UFO!","<p>The age-old goodies Vs baddies in space continued with the Spyrians replacing the Blacktrons as the bad guys trying to steal Ice Planet and Explorien&#39;s technology and secrets. The Spyrians&nbsp;may not have been as cool as the Blacktrons&nbsp;as villains but they did have some neat vehicles, including giant robots and this circular&nbsp;spacecraft, to pull off their nefarious plans.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>I really like the looks of this set, probably the first time Lego actually made a circular UFO-style spaceship. It looks menacing and is deceptively large once you start &#39;flying&#39; by hand. It must be said that its not the most robust spaceship ever, drop this onto the floor and something&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;break, but generally its easy to reassemble. The basic frame is made up of eight 10x10 corner plates, quite rare pieces and ones that are quite useful in other builds of spaceships and even buildings. These form a craft with two halves, more about that in a minute. The upper and lower corner bricks have a gap between them, the main purpose of which is to house the extendable grab on the right-hand side. This is a neat touch, enabling the dastardly crew to grab satellites in orbit. However, the big flaw is that the arms of the grab are actually quite flimsy and easily break off and they fail to grip onto most things, the two circular blue bricks on each grab not helping matters either. I feel a different method of gripping or even a magnet would have been of more use. The left-hand gap is filled by two blue radio antennas which annoying fall off easily but are very hard to reattach. The craft when on the ground sits on five 4x4 circular bricks, functional and stable but not very elegant.</p>

<p>The craft is powered by an array on engines, two on each side (doubling as handles when pulling the two sections apart), four behind the cockpits (again fiddly to reattach if they fall off), two large cone and dish rockets between the twin tailfins&nbsp;and two cones with blue cone flames which can be tilted up and down at the rear. The overall aesthetic looks good, perhaps being over-endowed with engines certainly gives an impression of a fast getaway vehicle, also aided by the two raked antenna on the roof. The nose is decorated by two blue dish lasers. The two tailfins&nbsp;are topped with small wings featuring a printed flat 2x2 brick which I assume to be a computer screen of some kind (as its carried by the buggy too), which is an odd location for a computer!</p>

<p>I really liked the feature of the two side-by-side cockpits, it reminded me of one of the enemy helicopters in the Mega Drive game&nbsp;<em>Urban Strike</em>&nbsp;which came out around the same time. The pilot sits the spacious right-hand cockpit, which was equipped with a printed computer sloped brick and a chainsaw brick used as a controller (perhaps for the buggy or Droid). The cockpit even features a safety barrier to prevent the pilot from falling out when the ship is opened. The left-hand cockpit contains the eight-wheeled buggy which the Droid rides. The buggy itself is nicely detailed and a&nbsp;figure wearing airtanks&nbsp;can also be seated if you want to leave the Droid piloting the spaceship. The main feature of the set is that you can pull apart the two halves to drop, and pick up, the buggy. The craft is surprisingly sturdy when being opened or closed and when closed the buggy is held securely.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with two figures, a Spyrian with printed torso, head with printed long red hair and headband and blue trousers, and a Spyrian&nbsp;Droid with printed torso and legs and head with a clear helmet allowing you to see the all the head detailing. I thought that was a nice touch. The Droid has a nice retro feel to it, like something from a 1950s sci-fi film which I quite liked.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I quite liked this set and it had many an adventure in stealthy robberies and high-speed shoot-outs with the Space Police. It looks the part and despite its flaws and fragility the overall result is quite good and the split fuselage with the buggy is a neat feature. Eventually though I actually put a floor in the second cockpit and equipped it as a two-man cockpit, there being ample space to sit two Spyrians&nbsp;in comfort. Eventually I broke this down and re-used the pieces for another self-designed Spyrian&nbsp;set, you get enough elements with this set to build a decent spaceship without having to dip into your stash of bricks. So if you can see past the flaws this is equal to any of the best Lego spaceships.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is somewhat square and not very deep,&nbsp;with the front and sides showing different angles of the model. &nbsp;The back has 4 rebuilds: 3 different spaceships and a robot. &nbsp;Opening up the set there is&nbsp;a cardboard pull out with the model and instructions inside. &nbsp;If I had got it&nbsp;MISB&nbsp;then the set would probably&nbsp;have come with a catalog and an&nbsp;order form, but it didn&#39;t. &nbsp;The instructions are easy to follow with a beige&nbsp;background to it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is nothing too special in the way of parts apart (geddit?) from the blue&nbsp;canopies,&nbsp;the trans blue large antenna pieces and&nbsp;some printed pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 2 minifigs&nbsp;with this set and both&nbsp;are great for their day! &nbsp;Although, nowadays the&nbsp;prints on the minifigs are quite basic by comparison.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took longer than I expected,&nbsp;but, it is very easy. &nbsp;Maybe&nbsp;20 to 30 minutes&nbsp;depending on the skill&nbsp;of the builder.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The end result of 20 to 30 minutes is nice! &nbsp;An interesting design&nbsp;for the dual cockpits. &nbsp;And the action feature (pull and a small rover pops out) works well. &nbsp;The rover could have used some work but hey, the spaceship is more important, and I understand why they did what they did.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This model is good to play&nbsp;with (due to fun action features)&nbsp;and good to display with (due to a nice retro feel).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this helped you choose your next Lego set :)</p>
