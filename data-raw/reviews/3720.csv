Anyway, who cares, it's so cool, the way the legs move is fantastic, absolutely silky smooth. The only possible flaw is that it could have done with say an extra minifig and a little car, but I guess I can just drive my 886 around with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-10T07:36:19Z","One of the best ever lego space sets! ","This set is simply great.  2 great classic space figures with gold logos, a fantastic war machine design resembling an At-At from Star wars, 2 detachable spacecraft, and 2 cute little rockets! It even has 2 &quot;boxes&quot; for storage as part of the front legs! 

The parts in this set are very versatile and great for building other things, and the box the set comes with has those nice plastic craters inside! If only they still made boxes like this! 

I have several of these sets and will maybe set them up on a lego space battlefield one day! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

What a great design... I liked the trans-green and black windows and the rockets inside. The moving of it is very cool, and the two space ships are also great. One of my favourites for a long time...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-09T14:34:27.09Z","An all-time great.","Why does everyone assume anyone who designs a walking machine is ripping off The Empire Strikes Back?  Such things have been around since some scientist designed a 'walking truck' back in the 1950s.  But anyway.  This really is one of the best sets Lego has ever released.  The walking mechanism is great, the head and back-end can be removed and combined together, the body is a silo for two rockets and the whole thing looks fantastic.  There are plenty of little details such as containers in the front legs for rock/mineral samples, and the 'tail' is a fully-moving mechanical arm. First-class.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My uncle bought this back from Europe for me about 3 - 6 months before it was released in Austrlia.  What a gift!  The design the versatility and coolness factor definitely have this set at the top of the list.  As it also reminded me of a walker in the Star Wars movies, that made it all the more worth while.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"abertr","2010-08-20T23:08:31.01Z","A new review for an old toy","This was a set i have had for years. &nbsp;I kept it assembled and never stripped it for parts. &nbsp;I was one of those kids who saw Empire Strikes Back later, and always saw this lego as an AT-AT (even if I didn't know its name at the time).<div><br></div><div>Looking back on this set, it is a truly amazing set. &nbsp;The leg movement is awesome (it actually works better than the motorized AT-AT in my mind), and has some unique pieces.</div><div><br></div><div>The ""missiles"" I believe are actually supposed to be satellites and the green and black plates are to disapaite the gasses.</div><div><br></div><div>My only complaint about the set was the rear spaceman had to have his oxygen tanks on the front to sit properly in the seat. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A great vintage set.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"Heisenberg","2017-12-06T18:32:22.283Z","Moonwalker","<p>This was my first space&nbsp;set and I was given it on my 8th birthday. &nbsp;It must have been old stock in the toy shop as it was seemingly retired 5 years before. &nbsp;It&#39;s probably why I remember it so well as it was my only classic space from that time.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;original didn&#39;t survive my younger self. The good news is that I&#39;ve obtained another. &nbsp;How does the set&nbsp;stand today?&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The&nbsp;build and parts</strong></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Lego Instructions very&nbsp;different back then compared to now. These ones where&nbsp;printed in what was West Germany and are good quality.&nbsp;No showing you what pieces to use and&nbsp;you really have to concentrate on the pictures. &nbsp;A lot&nbsp;of nostalgia building this. Classic Lego experience.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">You start with&nbsp;the ships and then onto the main body. Interesting use of hinge and turntable&nbsp;for the action feature. All the builds are modular and fit together to form the mech walker.</span></p>

<p>A lot&nbsp;of interesting pieces, most notable are the trans light and dark green windows. &nbsp;The frame for these are in grey&nbsp;which makes them quite rare. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The mini-figures</strong></h3>

<p>Classic red and&nbsp;blue spacemen. &nbsp;The&nbsp;helmet chin&nbsp;straps from this time where slightly thicker but they would still break all the same. &nbsp;That&#39;s&nbsp;what happened to my&nbsp;childhood ones but these are great figures none the less.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model and playability</strong></h3>

<p>The model looks great and really stands out. The walking feature was really advanced.&nbsp;Yes it does look a bit like a certain vehicle&nbsp;from Star Wars, but this kind of animal machine hybrid was really popular at the time. I would say there is a bit of a transformers influence in there&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>Loads of fun to be had. &nbsp;There was no real explanation to what things where. &nbsp;The ships could be detached leaving the middle as a base. &nbsp;You had rockets/satellites to launch. &nbsp;The windows&nbsp;can be opened to gain access/vent gas.&nbsp;Compartments on the legs which could be opened up to repair/refuel. It really was left to your imagination.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall</strong></h3>

<p>This set is great but it does have a lot&nbsp;of faults. &nbsp;The build for the walking feature causes stress on the pieces and will damage them over time. &nbsp;The window frame elements are easily bent and won&#39;t usually survive the toy box. &nbsp;In fact a lot&nbsp;of the elements are easily broken which is why a lot&nbsp;of them were&nbsp;discontinued.</p>

<p>As a toy I mark it down as it would not pass quality control these days. &nbsp;It&#39;s probably why they are so rare as not many of them would have survived being played with.</p>

<p>As a collector it displays well and the&nbsp;set really&nbsp;speaks of its time. Really enjoyed building and I&#39;m glad to have it. &nbsp;Thanks for reading.</p>
