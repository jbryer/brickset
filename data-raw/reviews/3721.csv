The rear wing assembly and the front cockpit individually seperate from the chasey to join into a small ship. Best thing about this set? The cockpit canopy is an absolute must for anyone looking to put together a cool helicopter or whatever. Very cool set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-04-06T13:43:16.233Z","Another great Blacktron set.","This is a fine set.  Its back and cockpit can be dis-connected and put together to form a spacecraft, it comes with various tools inside those cabinets, a great design and plenty of useful pieces, all in Blacktron's dramatic colour scheme.  A must for fans of Lego space.

<p>This set&#39;s got a few neat elements-- Mostly, it&#39;s full of basic black and yellow pieces that aren&#39;t terribly rare, but a few pieces stand out as really cool:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Printed Blacktron logo nose slope</li>
	<li>Canopy extender (a new piece at the time)</li>
	<li>Blacktron figure</li>
	<li>Yellow hoses</li>
	<li>Black window shutters</li>
	<li>Several printed tiles and 1x2 bricks</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on piece count, it should probably come with another minifigure, although given the vehicle design, it&#39;s understandable that only 1 was included.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<p>As with other original Blacktron sets, this set comes apart into 3 modules, which seem to be suited to turning the cockpit and rear section into a small fighter, leaving behind the larger vehicle frame on the ground.&nbsp; The sections fit together with other Blacktron vehicles, of course, making this a great addition to a Blacktron collection.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a few other features like a swiveling body, opening cabinets, folding wings, a double-hinged cockpit, and some bending &quot;piston-like things&quot; on the body.</p>

<p><strong>Design:</strong></p>

<p>The design is probably the best of any of the original Blacktron sets, managing to look sleek and cool in both land and &quot;fighter&quot; modes.&nbsp; Its color scheme also helps contribute to the model, giving it an aggressive feel.&nbsp; The &quot;wings&quot; on the rear of the vehicle resemble more of a &quot;spoiler&quot; when attached to the body, making them look less out of place-- as well as giving it a sense of speed.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>I expect the hinge design on the body would not be a legal build by today&#39;s standards, as the hinge pieces used could put a lot of stress on the elements if bent too far to the left or right, since the rotation axis is not at the center of the circle! (This might be why the flexible hoses were positioned across the gap, to provide automatic straightening of the body)</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>While not a flagship model for the Blacktron lineup, this set really helps to solidify Blacktron&#39;s reputation as being one of the best designed Space subthemes.&nbsp; A simply fantastic set.</p>

Pros:

Huge vechicle

sweet minifig

nice details

blacktron has an excellent color scheme

cons:

the instruction book, because it is 20 years old, is incredible hard to understand compared to today's

"krysto2002","2008-07-20T16:43:55.217Z","A truly formidable foe","If the Blacktron still uphold the &quot;villan&quot; status, than this is a really powerful ship, since it is large,  yet quick (especially with that engine!) and also turns into a space ship. The fender on the front also makes a great plow when this machine drives through walls making a sudden appearance. Also the tool cabinets are a nice touch. The only gripes are that the set is too valuable nowadays to aquire, you're better off buying the parts individually and self assembling the set. Also on the cons are:
- a sideless cockpit like in the unitrion sets, can easily be solved with a few slopes.
- the hinge-like center tends to buckle slightly.
- the tubes come off too easily, but add a nice touch.
- the &quot;wings&quot; at the sides are cool, but must remained unfolded while driving since the tubes are in the way, and don't look that great wolded when in spaceship-mode.
- Finally: the wheels are nice, but look cooler in yellow, try it, the yellow wheels are cheaper, easier to find and add a nice touch.

"vynsane","2010-06-04T13:14:23.17Z","Scourge of surface trade routes throughout the galaxy","<p>After the original Space theme ran for about a decade, Blacktron was the first distinct faction to emerge with a distinct color scheme and logo, unified figure designs and play features. Obviously, with the menacing colors and designs, while not necessarily outwardly stated by LEGO themselves, Blacktron became the de facto 'evil' faction, pitted against the relatively peaceful 'Classic' faction.</p><p>As a child I had three of the four original offerings from the Blacktron faction and recently&nbsp;reacquired&nbsp;this set. As BT was my absolute favorite subtheme of my favorite theme, I was ecstatic to have it back in my newly&nbsp;burgeoning&nbsp;LEGO collection.</p><h4>Figures</h4><div><ul><li><b>Blacktron Pilot</b> - The sole figure in this set is the driver/pilot of the craft. In all-black with relatively intricate white detailing, this starkly-clad spaceman cut an imposing form in relation to the previous (generally) brightly colored, smiley classic spacemen.</li></ul></div><h4>Accessories</h4><div><ul><li><b>Helmet</b> - To my knowledge, Blacktron figures were the first to feature the redesigned, sleeker helmets that accommodated the more angular visors than the old standard 'bucket' style helmets.</li><li><b>Visor</b> - Color-matched to the helmet, this solid black visor added that menacing touch to the whole figure.</li><li><b>Hammer</b> - Rather self-explanatory, this is stowed in the side cargo bay of the vehicle.</li><li><b>Signal Paddle</b> - Also stowed in one of the cargo bays.</li><li><meta charset=""utf-8""><b>Wrench</b>&nbsp;- Ditto.</li><li><b>Spacegun (torch)</b> - Stowed in the cargo bays and the only 'lethal' accessory.</li></ul></div><h4>Parts</h4><p>Weighing in at 284 pieces, in 1987 this probably originally cost somewhere between $20 and $25 in The States. The fact that I got it for $24 and change in 2010 is remarkable, if only to boast ;).</p><p>The color&nbsp;palette&nbsp;(like all of series 1 of Blacktron) consists mainly of black, with yellow accents, some smattering of transparent red, and a transparent yellow canopy. There is a modicum of Technic parts that are used to connect different sections together, but mostly the set is comprised of black plates and bricks. There is are eight printed pieces in all:</p><div><ul><li>1x2 Brick w/yellow grille pattern in black (x2)</li><li>1x2 Tile w/black grille pattern in yellow (x2)</li><li>1x2 Tile w/black arrow pattern in yellow (x2)</li><li>1x2 Tile w/computer pattern in yellow</li><li>4x4 Tapered wedge w/Blacktron Logo pattern</li></ul></div><h4>Build</h4><p>The build is modular, with the main chassis being the initial focal point, with the cockpit and rear engine/wing assembly constructed separately and then connected to the chassis when finished. There are some interesting design cues used, such as the hinged assembly of the front and back half of the chassis, to enable steering. In order to keep the model from turning wildly, four yellow hoses are connected on either side of the hinge to enhance rigidity so that it only turns when one wants it to.&nbsp;</p><p>Four 1x2 hinge bricks provide for some detailing to the 'engine' of the chassis - their orientation hinting at some sort of piston or exhaust capacity, each adorned by two round bricks in black each then topped with a transparent red 1x1 round plate.</p><p>The cockpit seems rather large to only accommodate one pilot, and the bottom is gappy, meaning the cockpit isn't air-tight. This can be assuaged by the addition of some 4x2 inverted double-slope bricks, but it isn't a deal-breaker. Since it's most likely an in-atmosphere vehicle only, it doesn't need to be air-tight.</p><p>The engine module is interestingly detailed, with wings that are hinged so as to swing out to full wingspan, or tuck in towards the body of the vehicle, though the full range is inhibited by the four yellow hoses.</p><p>The cargo bays on either side of the vehicle are a nice touch, adding storage for the accessories and adding to playability.</p><h4>Action Features</h4><div>While this is before the era of flick-fire missiles, spring-loaded guns and brick-built button mechanisms meant to break the vehicle apart, there is a rather cool action feature - the front and rear modules can detach from the chassis and converge to form a small flying vehicle. In this state, the wings of the engine module can fully close upon the cockpit module, or still swing out to full span. It is also intended that you can mix-and-match modules from other Blacktron sets, which is even detailed in the instruction manual.</div><h4>Conclusion</h4><div>With the recent re-emergence of Space Police, who originally came upon the scene in 1989 to counter the threat of the growing Blacktron Dominion, we can only hope to also see the re-emergence of Blacktron to the galactic&nbsp;milieu. There have been hints throughout the bad guy ships in the Space Police 3 theme, with&nbsp;graffiti-style stickers spelling out ""Blacktron"" on the side of the Space Truck in set 5972 ""<a href=""/detail/?Set=5972-1"">Container Heist</a>"" (also known as ""Space Truck Getaway"") and markings similar to the pattern of the original Blacktron Pilot with the logo of Blacktron 2 on the torso of bad guy ""Rench"" in set 5981 ""<a href=""/detail/?Set=5981-1"">Raid VPR</a>"" there have been rumblings that the Black Hole Gang may become a more organized force.

<div class=""description"">
<div>
<p>4/5. Overall this is a great Lego set, but there are definitely some flaws in my opinion with the finished build, and enough of them to deduct a point off of this classic space set.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The completed model does not quite live up to the images in my opinion as there are a few gaps here and there.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I like the modular design to this, but they don&#39;t quite pull it off.&nbsp; The cockpit area detaches via technic pins, but when separated, neither part would appear to be realistically usable.</li>
	<li>The tail section also detaches via pins, and even though the box art would show this as a flying spacecraft, it doesn&#39;t make much sense... the radar dishes become engines and the engines become guns?&nbsp; There also aren&#39;t any control panels on that section so the Blacktron guy is flying this using his mind?</li>
	<li>The vehicle may look a bit better without the 2 black support structures and radar dishes on top, but could just be my personal preference and is easily changed.</li>
	<li>The yellow hoses tend to push the vehicle&#39;s front end in one direction or another so you have to drive it with both hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the things noted above, I still think this is a great set and would recommend anyone interested in classic space and Blacktron pick it up.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>The build process itself is pretty enjoyable compared with other sets from the 80&#39;s and I would give it 5/5 if not for some of the things that I consider design flaws noted above.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>I give this set a high rating for parts. There are about 80 unique parts spread across the 270 included which is fairly high for that era.&nbsp; There are lots of great classic space elements such as the canopy extender in trans-yellow, the yellow and black hoses, classic blacktron printed elements, and even black windows and shutters (only available from 2 other sets).&nbsp; You also get a Blacktron minifig which is of course excellent.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>4/5 for playability.&nbsp; This is a fairly large set for the era in terms of pieces incluced, but it only has 1 minifig.&nbsp; You have the ability to detach elements, but then part of your set is left stranded with no one to operate.&nbsp; There are also the issues noted above which impact playability... especially problems with steering.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find what this sold for back in the day, but would assume about $25 since the Renegade ship from the same year had an extra fig and more pieces for $30.&nbsp; $25 in 1987 is about $55 in today&#39;s dollars and the set currently goes for about that price used.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s worth it for nostalgia and for the cool collection of parts.&nbsp; This Battrax also predates the first Michael Keaton Batman movie by 2 years, so is it the first modern Batmobile?</p>
