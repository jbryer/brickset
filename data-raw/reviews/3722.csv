The blue and gray are awesome too, i think. The builting of this set is good. The design and color scheme do a great effect. This set is small and have few pieces, but is playable, with useful pieces and cool to play. The alien minifigure included is simple but nice and in the original lego style. I rate so, the Zo Weevil, a small but cool old space set, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-07-07T00:52:54.047Z","So Evil?","Firstly I have to say that the name of this model really makes me smile. It sounds like a bug but also sounds too similar to &quot;so evil&quot; to be just a coincidence. The vehicle itself is different to most little craft as it doesn't use that standard one large piece and then build around it, it is all small individual pieces. I really like the way they have not only used small turbines on the side but have used other pieces on them to add in more detail.

The vehicle is controlled by a control pad which is very different to previous series. All pieces are printed so NO STICKERS to annoy you with. The way LEGO have used six pieces around the vehicle in neon green really enhances it and makes it look a treat.

The mini-fig looks like he is out of this world with black pants, grey top, green hands, black hands, green see through helmet and weird dots and symbols all over his top and face. If you like space men this is one to have.

Overall its quite a good model for it's size, excellent aesthetics, lovely colour scheme and no flaws that I can find. I fell this model is a 6/10 or Above Average as for some reason I find it just so appealing. I would say this  is a great one to get for someone who likes space.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
