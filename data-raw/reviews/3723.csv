"clundsberg","2010-09-06T23:36:56.88Z","A fun little lego jaunt","I give this an overall 5 becasue it's a neat, fun little set to have as an addition to your space collection. It's a very fast build but that experience is easily countered by some unique slightly retro parts that you just don't see a lot of in legos these days.<br/>Due to the limited pieces this set is basically confined to being the basic speed sled model, but I find this to be comforting at times.&nbsp; I think there is a niche for these smaller sets that allow a kid to build it on a road trip without the risk of losing many pieces or consuming too much time with the build and not the play.<br/>Cool figure, very nice decal-painted pieces,&nbsp;neon parts and some unique shapes make this a nice little set.",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5

 (6943) is a LEGO Space (Insectoids) set which came out in 1999. It comes
with 1 minifig and 20 pieces. This set does include no decals and 
there're no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces.<br><br><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/6942-1.jpg[/img]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigures:</span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><br></span><span><span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cyborg:</span></span>

We get some unique pieces which I've only seen in the LEGO Space (Insectoids) theme which are the 2 curved lasers in the front. On the front you can see the laser and a nice slope piece which has some nice printings on it. On the top of that slope you can see the controls and on the back of that model is the engine. It may be a good army builder and also good for pieces but it really doesn't do anything...<br><br><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ideas:</span><br><br>This
 set also comes with 3 ideas which you can build with the pieces of this
