","almost unbelivable! this is realy greate ,because of real desire of creating a real thing. here the autors created the conditions to accomplish an idea: the big number of elements.elements of oll kinds.here is many decorative elements with firmly trans-color.but disadvantages are exist!not enought moving elements confronting to whole mass of mashine that is belt of wild quantity of stative basic elements or just stative elements.ant more of that: comparing 6949 and 6889 creatures it is not hard to figure that &quot;robo-guardian&quot; is faceless.it is a great disadvantage.i think why do thedesigners in lego gone mad on wheelled drive system?!i think they will not suffer very much in rebuilding wheells to the legs(but normal legs!!not as &quot;Roboforce&quot; theme!!).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-04T16:24:13Z","Mighty Mogul","This set is almost certainly the &quot;face&quot; of the Spyrius space sub-theme. It has several different features. The main focus of the set is obviously the Mighty Mogul-a large humanoid robot. There are three mini-figures which come with the set. These are the Mighty Mogul commander, a Spyrian soldier and a man-sized robot. The Mighty Mogul is very easy to play with and wheel around due to ten wheels that are on the base. These allow it to turn 360 degrees on the spot. Just above the wheels is a chamber with a gun hanging above it. The chamber has a grey ladder hanging down in front of it. Above that is another small chamber, which is a perfect size for the small scout craft which is included in the set. This chamber even has pieces to stop the scout craft falling out. Above that is the mechanism which allows the arms to remain in a position. This has been designed to prevent the &quot;arms&quot; of the Mighty Mogul from falling back into place after they have been raised. Above that mechanism is the control centre of the Mighty Mogul, the head. It contains a cockpit. It is possible to detach the head from the body, and affix the front parts of the arms on the sides of the head and place the scout craft on top of the neck to form two separate vehicles. On the ends of the arms are two different attachments. One of the arms has a pincer arrangement, whilst the other has a magnet on the end. I think that this is overall one of the most iconic and well-designed models in the entire Space theme, not just the Spyrius sub-theme. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pythonkid","2005-08-08T23:15:11Z","KICK HIS RO-BUTT!","This is the face of the Spyrius theme, as everyone else has stated. This is one of my favorite space sets. I still remember the explorien commercial with the Explorien Starship diving right into this thing. That was neat. So anyways, to the set. The set has three sections. The bottom section has an area for the droid, and for the box that has the computer things in it. It is magnetic as well. It is like an Aquazone crystal box, but a different color. Then, the middle section. In the back, there is an area to store a small mini flying vehical. This vehical can be a replacement head for when the actual head is in the flight mode. Above this is the arms. The arms use technic places, so that you can &quot;lock&quot; the arms in place when they are lifted up. You can make them go back down by pushing up on the lever. The arms are detachable and can attach to the head. One arm has a magnet, and the other has a grabber hand. Now finally, the head. The head is a small, but fancy cockpit. it has two computer things inside. it is also roomy. As mentioned before, you can attach the arms to it, and detach it from the body into a neat ship. 

Overall, this is a very sturdy robot. This is my favorite Syrius set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-17T19:47:06.427Z","5/5 cooler then in the picture","     This set is really cool compared to some other robot sets in the mid 90's.  The first thing about this set is the amazing color scheme.  I like the way that LEGO used old dk gray, red, black, trans neon green, and trans red instead of the usual spyrius colors.  I don't know why the color schemes are different but it just look cool.  The figures in this set are great.  You get them all.  Three is a good number for this set.  The little vehicle that goes in the back is pretty cool to, and fits in quite snuggly.  the carrying case in the front atop the 10 small wheels is pretty cool too.  The &quot;body&quot; section of the robot is ok with lots of space, but is kind of big and bulky.  The top part that comes off has spots for the arm sections to attach.  The set can be purchased for cheap prices nowadays.  Every single cent was worth it.  You'll be pleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legomaniac_jacob","2011-12-29T21:05:14.57Z","Robo ""Big Dawg"" Guardian","Robo Guardian is an epic space set, probably my favorite lego space set of all time.&nbsp; This was another birthday present for me, it magically appeared that morning, my parents must have set it out the night before so I discovered it immediately after waking, while they were still asleep.&nbsp; <br><br>In true lego style, the set comes complete with 3 minifigs-- a captain, a scout spyrius dude, and a black-faced slave droid who seems to live in the backside of Robo Guardian himself. <br><br>As someone else noted, Robo Guardian has a fantastic color scheme, lots 
of cool features like a magent, many moveable turnable hinges and joints in 
his arms (I seem to recall his arms being detachable??), and even Robo's 
head detaches from his body and turns into a small flying craft with the
 captain inside.&nbsp; I love the red translucent shield.&nbsp; Robo guardian also has some gears and axles inside of him that make clicking noises as you move his arms.&nbsp; <br><br>Robo Guardian is very well constructed, so much so that it can be a pain to have to disassemble him, almost like how annoying it is to disassemble a complex Technic set.<br><br>Overall though, i highly recommend this set and consider it one of the finest Lego has made over the years.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Jakenej","2015-04-23T05:23:16.917Z","straight from the golden days of LEGO","<p>I always wanted this set as a kid! The playability with this set really contrasts compared to modern genres similar to this series.</p>

<p>I was really surprised with the detail and effort in terms of design that LEGO put into this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing new about the instructions, except that it demonstrates the functionality of the set on the back. The box is standard with alternate models on the back; those are always nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set includes parts like magnets,&nbsp;45 degree sloping corners, mostly printed tiles except for the sparkly sticker on the front. I like the older space sets a&nbsp;lot more because you don&#39;t see as many stickers on the builds, so I give the parts a good rating because you can use most the parts for other builds, without having to take off the stickers and abandoning them as they lose stickiness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In my opinion, LEGO has a rule for how many minifigures can be put in a set depending on its proportions. This set outdoes that rule seemingly with an extra minifigure, giving it a better value for your money. It includes a spyrius commander, usual generic spryius, and an android. The leg/joint printing was not common at the time and so praise for the android. Its transparent helmet was also not common.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It took me a generous amount of time to build the robot, but it was enjoyable. I especially like the &quot;evil&quot; color scheme of the series, black and red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There is a&nbsp;lot of separable parts with this model, seemingly was/still is a common trait of the genre. The head separates and combines with the arms to create an independent spacecraft. The mini flying vehicle is also compatible; which&nbsp;can then replace the standard head.&nbsp;Even though this set is even older than me, the functionality lives up to modern standards.</p>

<p>The arms can attack via a simple gear system which locks the arms in place, counterclockwise, so that they only go in the up direction, and then can drop on their opponent. The extra supports at the bottom make it harder to tip over. The top set of the wheels spins in the opposite direction as the latter, like a gear,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a neat little feature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>sturdy, nice looks, intimidating, and looks like it&#39;s ready to take on the Unitron!</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend this set, not only because of the rating of the set itself, but also because the price on this sort of vintage LEGO&nbsp;is multiplying, and I was lucky enough to have bought it for 60 dollars. For the worth of the set, that seems a little steep, but I&nbsp;would expect such a high demand for&nbsp;sets like this. I especially like how back then they could put an entire series and you on one side;&nbsp;the bad guys,&nbsp;the good guys, or the in-between, and could include more in the sets than&nbsp;a half-and half. Apart from that, there isn&#39;t really anything significant I&nbsp;can point out wrong with this set.</p>

"Mlyneck","2018-08-29T18:31:06.223Z","Spyrius' Engineers' Masterpiece","<p>I remember the time when I was a kid, and I look over the catalog pages with Spyrius and Ice planet over and over again. Robo-Guardian was one that I dreamed of. I cannot afford it of course, but I had Reckon Robot which was also pretty cool.</p>

<p>Anyway, when I found this set in a very good price I haven&#39;t a second thought about buying it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Build</strong></h2>

<p>The build is mainly vertical, although there&#39;s a lot of pieces to use during building it, it&#39;s not boring at all. It is very sturdy too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About Robot</strong></h2>

<p>The robot has two pretty long arms with a claw on the left and magnet on the right.</p>

<p>They can be swing up, down not really (i will get to this), hinge inward, and that&#39;s it.<br />
I would like them to be able to articulate more.<br />
Speaking of arms, they also have one pretty useless feature, which is locking when turning them backward. After that, they can be released by pushing a little lever on the back of the robot. It could be used for kind of smashing things on the front, I guess.</p>

<p>The robot has two &#39;storage compartments&#39; on the back. One keeps the little pod with the second Spyrius member. And here&#39;s my favorite feature of this Robot: Head can be taken off and part of the arms can be attached to it, making it a separate crab-like small spaceship. Then, the small pod can replace the head so the Robot still will have &quot;a face&quot;. This is a small thing but I love it.</p>

<p>The second compartment is a little space for the Spyrius Android, and for one more figure if needed.</p>

<p>The robot is moving using 10 wheels (5 on each side, but only 3 are touching the ground) I think this was a good idea, as it is making the build more stable and sturdy. The friction between the top and bottom rows of wheels is little to low, so the top ones are not always turning when moving a robot around</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The set comes with three minifigures. Spyrius Chief, regular Spyrius Crewmember, and Spyrius Android. The first two minifigs are good, but the Droid is more interesting. It has a transparent helmet, silver printing of robot-face on the head, printed torso AND legs (which was not that common at the time). The color scheme of minifigs goes well with the whole theme, which I really like. The red and black are a timeless connection, and the trans-lime details work with it very well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Overall this is a great, interesting build, and most importantly, a great toy for kids.&nbsp; It is a good display set as well. I don&#39;t know how to feel about release price since I don&#39;t know how much 36$ was in the US on 1994. I wanted this set since I was a kid, and I&#39;m more than happy to have it.</p>
