"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-21T08:59:26Z","An all-terrain delight","I first got this set when I was a kid. I remember driving it around my cousin's house shortly after christmas. It was a favourite as it had yellow spacemen which were a new and exciting addition to my legion of red and white ones. It also included many parts which were brand new to me at the time.
I recently re-acquired this model second hand from the internet (curse my parents who sold my massive lego collection when I was 17!!!) and I don't think it has lost any of it's excitement or playability.

The Mobile Rocket Transport is a monster 8-wheeler vehicle with pairs of wheels linked by beams to 2 central axles. Each wheel pair can move independently of the others which makes the vehicle easily driveable over obstacles such as rocks, living room rugs, and small family pets. The front axle pillar is fixed while the rear one is steerable and this rear steering system can take a little getting used to. The vehicle appears to be driven by a rocket motor mounted on the rear axle pillar.
The driver is coccooned in a front cockpit of trans-yellow which gives a good all-round view, but the roof is open so breathing apparatus is required on your spacemen.
The vehicle's cargo area consists of a large rocket and satellite payload, carried in a cradle. The rocket is transported horizontally, but gear is provided to move the rocket into a vertical position behind the vehicle ready for launch. Then the cradle opens allowing the vehicle to move to a safe distance before launching commences.

The set is full of nice little touches, from the vehicle's headlights to swivelling positioning boosters on the launching cradle. I also loved the 2 large minifig tools that came with this kit - I guess they were supposed to be TV cameras but in my world they were large photon cannons required to fend off the advances of the evil squad of space minifigs controlled by my childhood friend!

I begin the process of order the pieces using Bricklink in February this year, some part like the wheels were very hard to find in England but today in August I received the final bricks and I am a proud owner of this set.
The set is amazing, it has very big wheel that make the car look great, and the canopy in front of the car is great with the classic space transparent yellow colour.
The rocket is made from a lot of pieces and looks vary nice.
It has 2 cool yellow minifigures, as usual in all the Lego sets it would be good if it came with more minifigures but two are ok.

Overall the wait was worth it and now I have another addition to my classic space collection.
5 from 5
Also I can’t believe that this set has only one review and it is a 4, please this set need more reviews!

great set with a nice design and there are good alternate models on the back of the box. there is also a rare piece in the lower trans yellow piece of the cockpit which is usefull for building moc's. goes well with the large base that came out at the same time. if you see one cheap grab it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T01:03:50.047Z","Special Set for Me","I won this set at a Lego competition at my local KBKids back in the day, so it holds a special place in my heart.  But this set is just an incredibly versatile set.  My standard for space has always had the formula: rocket, car, base and flying vehicle.  If you had a set that could construct all four of those elements, then you had a very well designed space set.  If you've seen the alternative designs on the back, you can see how many permutations of designs there are for this set.

The set has a nice set of 8 mid-sized wheels along with a long rocket, which is well constructed.  The rocket has an axle to keep it from easily snapping apart and the rear neatly unfolds to set the rocket on the ground gently.  The cockpit is really unique too as it is composed with the only clear yellow lower cockpit piece of that era.  You have two sets of wings for a small space craft.

If I have a major complaint about the current Lego sets, it's that they're far too large and somewhat not economically feasible for the hardcore collector to handle anymore.  Back then, this type of set would've been considered a &quot;large.&quot;  These days, it would be considered a mid-sized vehicle.  But you could easily place one of these vehicles nice on a lunar base plate, whereas most space vehicles are so vast that you can't house them anywhere anymore, except on large shelves or flat surfaces.  A set like this had a good number of diverse elements, was a fair size, and very reasonably priced.  I really wish that Lego would downscale their sets again in some ways because sets like this are sorely missed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"HappyStikBeaver","2010-03-22T19:41:17.5Z","One of my favorite classic space sets!","<p>Wow, this is just a really fun set.</p>
<p>Not only does it look great on display, it is also is fun to play with! I like the large tires, and how they can move (not to mention, their are EIGHT of them!). I think the design of the set is good too, even with the simple parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: 
<li>Nice features, like the lights, antenna, and a radar. 
<li>Good design, I especialy like the steering wheels and ""blasters."" 
<li>A nice diamond like shape, and many movable wheels. 
<li>A great rocket to launch. 
<li>Awesome clear yellow windows and good computers.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top of the rocket falls off easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard to steer using the back wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall a great set, and I am very happy to own it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Skut","2014-09-03T12:26:53.027Z","A buzz lasting decades","<p>I still remember staring dumbfounded at the tiny picture of this set in the 1982 Lego catalogue. I simply didn&#39;t believe such a cool set could be possible - and were those astronauts really YELLOW?!</p>

<p>Months later my birthday finally rolled around and I was lucky enough to receive this behemoth. The reality was even better than the anticipation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How to describe this set? It&#39;s very hard to find the words to do it justice. But here goes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The transporter vehicle itself is magnificent. I suspect it owes something to the ICBM transporters of the 80s, but Lego found a way to transform those weapons into a peaceful application. The tyres and independent suspension, with massive ground clearance, make this just about the most rugged Classic Space vehicle Lego ever built. Plus the rear wheels had a rocket booster for an emergency dash (perhaps to reach minimum safe distance after a launch failure?)</li>
	<li>The colour scheme uses the old grey/blue/trans yellow combo well, with some black thrown in to good effect.</li>
	<li>The yellow astronauts were deployed for the first time this year and their colouring really makes them stand out.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The rocket is a step ahead of anything else Lego did in rocketry in Classic Space. The four side boosters are especially effective and work better than the four- finned piece that was introduced in later sets.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The articulated rocket placement arm and clamp are a great step forward from 897. Now you can place the rocket, retreat to a safe distance in your massive vehicle, and let it rip!</li>
</ul>

<p>A truly brilliant set which captures all that is great about Classic Space. A worthy addition to any collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
