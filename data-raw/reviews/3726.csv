You really have to have owned one as a kid to appreciate it.  Looks stupid but it has a lot of really great pieces.

It looks like it would topple over easy but it doesn't, the litle engines for feet are a bit weird but it just adds to the charm. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I love the blue colour, the yellow windows, the transparent red shields, and especially the blue &quot;windscreen&quot; pieces at the sides.  I have to admit it looks a *little* odd, but it has so many fantastic pieces!  

The design of this set obviously isn't as cool looking as the 6940, but the bricks are more compatible with other classic space sets.  It also comes with 3 figures instead of 2, and has a rocket, buggy, and folding spaceship!!  Just as much fun, and more cool pieces!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It has so many great pieces and the way it all clips together is superb. It may look like the lesser known brother of the &quot;Lost In Space&quot; robot, but it makes a great addition to any space base.

The colour scheme fits in very well with other sets of the same era and this is worth getting just for the novelty value alone!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Chompins","2014-01-06T23:54:22.35Z","Quirky favorite","As a kid growing up in a fairly rural area, this was a hard set to track down. At some point, it showed up as a mail-away offer in a Lego catalog or publication of some sort (can't remember which) and somehow I convinced my parents to let me send away for it. So glad I did because this ended up being a big favorite of mine, the start of a lot of great adventures and stories. <br><br>Last week I was at my parents' house and was able to locate and reconstruct this set. Such a fun, quirky design. I can't remember ever thinking this was an ugly design as a kid and I find it really charming as an adult. The over-sized ""head"" of the robot, the design of the dashboard, the rotating satellite dish, the pivoting dishes, the strange ""chomping"" blue compartments flanking the head, and the great robot arms make this so much fun to play with. I love the modularity of the set, too, with the mini rover, the flying craft, and the missile, er, I mean, rocket on the back. So glad that I was able to resurrect this set. A real gem.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Derfel","2015-10-15T21:05:17.937Z","A face only a mother could love ","<h3>6951: Robot Command Center,&nbsp;</h3>

<p>WARNING: this is one of those gushy &lsquo;my first LEGO memory&rsquo; type reviews, I apologize in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout 1983 I had gazed adoringly at the 928 Space Cruiser as the few sets slowly disappeared from the shops. &nbsp;My mother couldn&rsquo;t afford it, so I went for broke and asked for the 6980 Galaxy Commander instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To educate me in the ways of finance my mother arranged payment for chores (I&nbsp;shoveled&nbsp;coal and polished floors to get this set). &nbsp;I saved and saved from my chore money and by the time I had accumulated the capital&hellip; they had all sold out.</p>

<p>I began 1984 with a bag of silver coins and even some folding money torturing my adolescent mind. &nbsp;When the new sets came out 928 was nowhere to be seen and 6980 was still too dear.&nbsp; &nbsp;I bought a job lot of Technic for &pound;10 from a boy in our village: 850 fork lift; 851 tractor; 853 car; 854 go-cart; 857 motorbike with sidecar; 858 engines.&nbsp; All complete in box, virtually un-played with.&nbsp; Impressed with my haul my mother got me the Robot Command Center because it was on sale.&nbsp; An unloved set even then.</p>

<p>I hated it.</p>

<p>It was ugly, didn&rsquo;t fly, made no sense and wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted.&nbsp; Then I put it together. &nbsp;I cannot remember any build before or since being so interesting and enjoyable, or playing with a set so devotedly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dense with intriguing parts it was my first brand new big set, it was my first taste of technic/classic brick cross over and suddenly my haul of colorful technic pieces came to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the Robot Command Center I was able to build a Galaxy Commanding Explorer Cruiser with far more modular sections, cubby holes, twirly things and antenna and it was V6 powered.&nbsp; The Classic Space blue clashed wonderfully with the bright yellow technic bits.&nbsp; LEGO had been a toy before 6951, afterwards it was a passion.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I remember the box had a lid and was used to store the most valuable LEGO pieces for many a year. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember if there were alternate builds on the box &ndash; I usually enjoyed reverse engineering those builds, but for me this one was always the set itself and the endless MoCs it spawned.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It says 295 pieces on the Brickset database and I cannot remember a denser collection of useful parts.&nbsp; It was light on windows, two great big yellow sloped windows and two 4x4 yellow hinged doors.&nbsp; My MoCs would suffer from a lack of windows for years as they were based on this set, technic and pocket money sets which didn&rsquo;t really have windows.&nbsp; I remember always being on the look out for Br.Blue windows when I was young. &nbsp;The 2x2 mailboxes were new to me, the blue arms, solid blue cockpits, various dishes, turntables, trans pieces and the rocket feet were all used again and again.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Yellow, Black and Red spacemen.&nbsp; I had collected a few pocket money sets for which red and white spacemen were common.&nbsp; The yellow guy looked weird, more like a robot.&nbsp; The black suited spaceman was king &ndash; rare and obviously the hero of his own twisted back story.&nbsp; The closest LEGO got to a baddie back then.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>I had never seen such a cross over between technic and standard bricks before.&nbsp; Clever little pegs and&nbsp;beams which enabled the fun stacking of the auxiliary vehicles.&nbsp; Looking at it now, there don&rsquo;t seem to be very many, but they made their impression.&nbsp; Unfortunately my burgeoning interest in Technic took a back seat while SPACESHIPS ruled the living room.</p>

<p>The two sensor pods that swing from it&#39;s knees were a very early SNOT technique that I remember having a big effect on my building&nbsp;plans thereafter. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed model</h3>

<p>The box art made it look silly, but if photographed from below its towering presence (to a young lad) would have given it&rsquo;s size and heft a more favorable portrait. &nbsp;It had a face only a mother could love and that was why I loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looked great and played brilliantly.&nbsp; The space ships were prone to fall apart if I remember.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When Benny finally got to put together his Spaceship, Spaceship, Spaceship it was the coming home&nbsp;moment that every LEGO fan within ten years either side of me remembered.</p>

<p>While the classic spaceships were great, the MoC&rsquo;d spaceships that this little set enabled were far greater in my world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEGO designs had been prone to conservative blocky builds.&nbsp; The Classic Space series exploded those restraints and the big friendly blue Robot was the maddest of them all.</p>

<p>Probably my favorite set of all time.&nbsp; My LEGO collection was handed down to younger cousins when I moved out of home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should and will get a replacement, but I&rsquo;ll need the yellow Technic forklift and engine sets to make my proper ship.&nbsp;&nbsp; And more windows.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Score</h3>

<p>My own LEGO scoring system: 4x4 - The first 4 concern how many building phases you had to go through: 1) first build, according to the instructions; 2) rebuild and try to improve it; 3) rebuild because you have to improve it; 4) give up and turn it into a spaceship.</p>

<p>The second 4 concern how you keep it: 1) a thing of beauty, put it on display and disassemble only if absolutely necessary; 2) disassemble carefully to enjoy putting it back together; 3) disassemble to work-in improvements as required; 4) disassemble and turn it into parts for a spaceship.</p>

<p>My system is based on the premise that even the worst set in original configuration were a good source of spares and ideas, therefore a good kick for the imagination.</p>

<p>This was a 1x1 that was so ugly it was beautiful, it went through each stage until it turned into the most perfect 4x4 and spawned some of my favorite MoCs.&nbsp; Even if it wasn&rsquo;t my first, this set makes you think about the endless options for stacking the bricks.&nbsp;</p>

For years my Lego&#39;s&nbsp;all sat in one big bin and now that my son is getting into the Lego age range. I have cleaned them all and have built this set from all the parts that I still have. The only missing parts are the clear red antennas&nbsp;on top. I broke them lon long ago. The set was still a joy to build and and play with. The small vehicles that attach to the set are a nice feature.</p>
