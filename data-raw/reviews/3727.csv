"regosmat","2006-04-16T19:49:16Z","One of my top 10 Classic Space sets","This is an absolute gem and porbably one of the most versatile (porbably number 1 for me) for its size. It is very sound in terms of its structure and it came with plenty of mini figs. I give fulll credit to the designer of this set.  Plenty of typical spacey bright colours (eg. trans red and trans green) as well which I really like.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

While it may not be up to todays standards (open-faced space helmets?) this is the set that I credit with starting my long-standing affair with the hobby.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-03-30T13:26:42.543Z","One of the greats.","This is, for me, one of the real icons of Classic Space.  A large buggy which, due to a modular design, can be separated to form a smaller buggy and a space station or a space station with two spacecraft.  Each of the spacecraft is constructed from one of the two 'generators' on the top of the midsection and one of the cockpits, the wheels being relocated under the wings to form boosters.  An inspired design and lots of fun.

"bluemodern","2012-09-16T02:37:55.83Z","Excellent modular classic space set","I had this set as a child and it was one of the biggest space sets I owned (which I still have). This set came with 4 minifigures and 1 brick built blue robot. Just with this set, you get every color of classic space minifigure except blue. It is nice to get the black classic space minifigure here since it didn't come in many sets.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/cP4gU.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>You also get some nice parts with the minifigures, I believe the blue jetpack and blue robot arms are </span></span>rare.</div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/bFh1e.jpg?1[/img]</span></span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>There are no stickers on this set. It comes with quite a few printed tiles, slopes, and bricks. Most of the printed pieces have arrows on them showing where the set connects and disconnects.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/YoxTu.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>One of the nicest aspects of this set is the modular design. The middle section can stand by itself. It has black hinge bricks that come down so it is stable without either of the two cockpits. The two cockpits can hook together through the use of technic pins. The cockpits can also hook to the panels that are on the top of the set.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/iBi3q.jpg?1[/img]</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Overall, this is a very nice looking set that has quite a few fairly rare parts in it. It has a great deal of&nbsp;playability&nbsp;because of the modular design, where you can make three different configurations. With over 300 pieces in this set, it takes a while to build. The building process was fun, though the two cockpits and structures on top are identical to each other so that can be repetitive. This was larger than most classic space sets at the time so it really stands out. I think the price was expensive for the time but you do get a lot with the set. If you can find this set at a good price I recommend picking it up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
