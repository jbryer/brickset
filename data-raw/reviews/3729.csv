"krysto2002","2008-11-13T16:41:11.857Z","King of the shadows","By far, this set makes it onto my top ten space ship list. A mid sized ship from the old blacktron series, the Renegade (great name, too) is a really fun set, shame it's so expensive nowadays. The ship, like its partners, the Invader and Battrax, is modular, inclusing a detachable cockpit, cargo crate, two boosters, and something that resembles a radar or a large laser cannon. The set connects perfectly in some amazing looking combo models. The color scheme is also appealing, but at the same time doesn't lack playability. Although the set has very few available tools, it makes up for that with the moon rover and two small hover cars (which could use som  reinforcing, since they don't stay together when you remove them) as well as plenty of decorated parts and (thank you) NO STICKERS! Sure some people complain about the cockpit being open at the bottom, but it adds a unique touch to the series that doesn't happen very often, but besides, nobody said where they were stationed, use your imagination, please!
If the set had some of the rare trans-red wedge-plates from the invader, the set would be even cooler. What's even cooler about this set is that unlike nearly every LEGO spaceship, this one is asymmetric, so if you cut it in half, the two sides wouldn't be mirror images. If I were to make the set better, I'd exchange the two castle wall/container lids for the ones from the Invader, and change the framework of the container so that it can accomodate some tools. I'd also reinforce the hover scouts and maybe add a few details, but other than that the set is a beautiful relic of a bygone age of LEGO which could easily surpass anything mars mission could cook up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2010-01-25T14:40:01.92Z","A True Original!","Anyone who picked up this set will probably fondly remember the modularity of it.  The number permutations for things you could do with the different sections that could separate were pretty amazing.  I believe there were 9 separate sections, but 6 of them had connector type of pieces you could use to reconfigure the ship, or create new ships.  For instance, the rear thrusters could both be separated and you could use one for a mini escape cruiser from the front right section and the front left blaster section.  Or you could make a small/mid sized voyager by removing the cargo bay and joining it with one thruster and the front right cruiser.  Truly genius at the time!

Prior to buying this set, I conjectured that the winged side sections (with the yellow slim nose cone) could be removed.  I was a little surprised when I found out that the part just behind the 3x2 roof piece could be extracted and used as a tiny getaway type of vehicle.  It was an interesting technique that they used for attaching the vehicles.

Another nifty piece for that period was the introduction of the large angled wings in the rear.   A few years before the airport series began introducing longer winged pieces, but they had a limit about them because of the angle.  This large angled section I think was easier to incorporate into a design because it was more ""blocky"" in terms of how it opened up.

Overall, this was just a fantastic set.  The fact that the two front sections didn't run parallel gave it a unique, ""alien"" appearance whereas many sets up to this point relied on symmetry.  Also, this series just looked cool in terms of the color schemes and the introduction of helmet visors.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dim","2010-03-09T07:34:23.75Z","The ugly duckling of Space - still a favorite","<p>Strangely enough, I have to give an average rate to a set which is actually a favorite of mine. But I feel there are a few issues with this set and reviews need to be objective.</p>
<p>Being European,&nbsp;I didn't know this set as a child. I found out about it through Brickset some 20 years later and I felt I had to have one for my vintage Space collection purely because of its rarity, so I bought a used one in great condition (even the box was in pristine condition) and&nbsp;had it sent&nbsp;all the way from the USA.</p>
<p>Now to the pros and cons:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>-Largest Blacktron spaceship; Not as big as the largest spaceships but still above average.</li>
<li>-Asymmetrical design; Very unique. The amazing Blacktron colour scheme is also a big plus. The buggy design is also great for such a small vehicle.</li>
<li>-Modularity; This set offers the main frame to attach components from the 6894 -<em> Invader </em>and the 6941 - <em>Battrax</em>, so it was&nbsp;a must-have only for this reason. Which makes the US-only availability completely incomprehensible, this set&nbsp;was really the backbone of the whole Blacktron modularity idea, but reserved only for the US. Hallo?</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>-Design; I have a feeling this spaceship looks better on the box picture than 'live'. In reality the spaceship is very long and the wingspan looks a bit narrow. Also the cockpit and the engines on the rear stand a bit high and make it look a bit like a wild goose in flight, not that agressive really.</li>
<li>-Space usage; this set is relatively large and comes with two Blacktron astronauts but there is really space only for one in the (unfortunately not airtight) cockpit. The cargo area is reserved for the buggy, so the only place where the other guy can take a seat is on one of the two escape pods on the wings, but having him exposed in such a big spaceship? This may be acceptable for smaller sets but not for the Blacktron flagship. </li>
<li>-Construction; the aforementioned pods on the wings are really lame, it's impossible to remove without breaking them (the similar escape pods on the 6986 - <em>Mission Commander</em> are a much better design <em>and</em> covered). Also the cargo is very stiffly inserted in the main frame, very hard to remove.</li></ul>
<p>All in all this set has&nbsp;quite a few&nbsp;disadvantages but the fact that it is the Blacktron flagship, the excellent models that one can create by combining the other two Blacktron vehicles and its skeletal, intimidating looks save the day.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"davee123","2015-02-18T03:05:41.32Z","An Amazing Classic Set","<p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>

<p>The elements in this set aren&#39;t all that amazing, although there are a few unique elements that are really helpful like the decorated black slopes, and some unusual pieces in yellow.&nbsp; It is nice that there are 2 figures offered with this set (the only Blacktron I set to come with more than 1 other than the 6987 Message Intercept Base).</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<p>This set really showcases the modularity of the Blacktron I theme amazingly well.&nbsp; The ship separates into 6 different &quot;pluggable&quot; components which can be mixed and matched with each other.&nbsp; By itself, it can form many hundreds of possibilities (not all of them sane), far more than any of the other Blacktron vehicles.</p>

<p>Additionally, it has 2 small &quot;escape pods&quot; and a small surface vehicle that don&#39;t work in the modular system, but add extra playability.&nbsp; (Plus, the folding wings, opening hatch, and bending radar dishes add even more play features-- making this one of the most playable models of the time)</p>

<p><strong>Design:</strong></p>

<p>The ship is one of the extremely few asymmetrical models that LEGO has come out with, but it&#39;s pulled off pretty well.&nbsp; The color design is excellent (of course, being Blacktron).&nbsp; The body is a little thin, which can make the extended &quot;neck&quot; on the cockpit look a little awkward, but it more than makes up for it with a sleek cockpit and menacing forward bending wings.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong><strong>:</strong></p>

<p>The dark colors and asymmetrical design caused it not to be sold in Europe (European moms objected to how evil it looked), but was still sold in the USA.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>As a whole, this is an amazing set-- the flagship of the original Blacktron lineup, and arguably one of the best LEGOLAND Space sets of all time.</p>
