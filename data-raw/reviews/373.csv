However because it was small and inexpensive, it was possible to have this little set and several other small car sets.  What did this mean?  Extreme races of course!  This coupled with another car or two, led to some fabulous imaginary races and provided hours of fun.

I was never a big fan of the knobbly tires on the race cars, however.  That is a small con though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the spoiler and it has no studs. The minifig has a matching torso to go with the car. This is very good for a car like this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Well today its number 4.</div><div><br></div><b>Minifigures:</b><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Light blue tint visor.</li></ul>An all black, zipper topped speed demon. He gets the clear bluey visor though and a smiley face. Black gloves would have perfected this chap for me. (Call me boring but I think I preferred it when all townsfolk looked the same, racers seem to grimace a lot now).</div><div><br></div><div><b>Red Stripe For Speed</b></div><div>What more is there to know about these repeat kit cars?! Well they all have little tweaks and mild differences, the obvious being the colour. Where one may have a large exhaust, another may be stunted or have a diminished wind spoiler. In this instance the front spoiler is actually a really nice 'tweak' and makes a smooth tile stand out as an emergent red stripe. Those white hub caps stand out very well against the darker bodywork.</div><div><br></div><div>The all black design is a neat look with this and the yellow '4' on the three stud long slant, used in so many of these racers. Its nice that this design incorporates, a front and very good rear spoiler along with well place standard exhaust pipes in grey and a safety bar for a seat. Packing all this in earns this one some extra brick points in my opinion and is preferable to 'wacky racer' style F1 with oversized exhaust etc though custom car designs should have their own well deserved subtheme.</div><div><br></div><div>The build remains the same essentially. Seven stud chassis, hub caps and tyres, plates for the red stripe, slants and more plates with the exhaust along with tiles for the spoiler. Playability is always good for little pocket money racers. Most kids would love older Lego racers even if an AFOL parent dusted it off and brought out of the attic or basement.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a pretty handsome one and deserves some recognition despite a same old experience. If you like them, its doubtful you will get bored of the endless colour combinations and of course collecting a favourite of each number car. Thinking of which, I never saw higher than a number '4'?</div></div>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,2
