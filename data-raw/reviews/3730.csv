This set is sooooo cool, when you turn the crank one way the landing pad and police cruiser deploy out the front, and the radar dish rises!  Then when you turn the crank back the other way the prison cell pops up on the roof AWESOME!  A must have for any space police fan!!!!!!!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-25T16:18:42.14Z","Nice Space Base","This set is very cool and also fun to play with. I like the jail cell alot which is pretty nice. The small hanger is OK but could be bigger. I like the use of blue and black pieces in this set. The little hovercraft is nice too. This is very good for a Space set and should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bluemodern","2012-11-11T02:01:35.047Z","Interesting space police outpost","This is an unusual set. It comes with three minigfigures (2 Space Police and 1 Blacktron figure). In addition to the main base (which I will get to later) there is a jail cell and a very small ship. One figure can fit in the cell, and the cell can attach to the back of the ship to be transported. The ship isn't designed that well but it does its job.<div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/iVjMl.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div>The ship with the jail cell on the back.</div><div><br></div><div>The ship fits inside the station/outpost and when you turn the wheel on the side the platform goes out so you can see the ship.

There are also no stickers in this set, the Space Police names on both sides of the cell and the slope on top are all printed along with the control and arrow tiles. The set is nicely designed, the platform cannot fall off the front of the station or go too far backwards. It is an interesting build, particularly putting together the parts that move.

"ra226","2014-10-05T08:52:56.033Z","Cruel and Unusual?","<p>I don&#39;t suppose the 8th Amendment applies to these guys, but I still feel the Isolation Base lays out a rather strange scenario. &nbsp;You have a prisoner who&#39;s either&nbsp;on display&nbsp;in his cell above the base for all to see, or reclined on his back for who-knows-why&nbsp;while the radar dish is in transmit position. &nbsp;There are more&nbsp;questions, but if you can avoid asking them, the set is a fairly standard Space Police set with some decent play value.</p>

<p>This is the one base for the original Space Police theme and as bases go, it&#39;s a bit small,&nbsp;the baseplate itself only being half the size of a typical one. &nbsp;I would have expected a base four times this size, with acomodations&nbsp;for perhaps 4-8 prisoners--ie, a full-on&nbsp;space prison.</p>

<p>Components include&nbsp;the main&nbsp;base, a standard prison cell, a small craft (essentially a flying fork-lift), and three minifigs: two Space Police, and one mean-as-ever&nbsp;Blacktron. &nbsp;The transport craft is designed to hold the cell flat on its back, which was common throughout the theme, and&nbsp;in fact, all but the smallest SP1 set came with one of these standardized cells, and all had the prisoner laying down during transport.</p>

<p>The colors are standard Space Police and look good, with just the right amount of trans red hilights. &nbsp;SP1 was the last Space theme to use a more muted color scheme--starting with M:Tron in&nbsp;1990, just about every space set had at least a few parts in&nbsp;these neon hilight colors.</p>

<p>In terms of design, I like how the entire base is raised above the the ground;&nbsp;this really aids in the whole &quot;isolation&quot; concept. &nbsp;I also like the open cage-like design with gaps between the panels (it reminds me of the rear section of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6973-1/Deep-Freeze-Defender"">#6973 Deep Freeze Defender</a>). &nbsp;The interior of the base, while sparse, does have a computer console so at least that makes sense. &nbsp;The transport docks at the front of the base and there&#39;s a lever that comes down to lock it into place, another nice little feature.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Well executed SP1 color scheme</li>
	<li>Comes with 3 minifigs, including a Blacktron</li>
	<li>Very interesting play functions, though their purpose is questionable...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A bit small for a base--especially one so important as a prison</li>
	<li>Treatment of prisoners? &nbsp;I mean, I know they&#39;re Blacktrons, but hey...</li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Put simply, the set is fun enough, but makes very little sense when you think about it. &nbsp;How does the prisoner&nbsp;eat? &nbsp;Sleep? &nbsp;If the planet has no atmosphere, does he have an oxygen supply? &nbsp;Are there hundreds of bases like this, or perhaps only the worst of the worst end up here--or maybe it&#39;s a transfer point before prisoners make it to the main jail? &nbsp;Bottom line, though I&#39;m not a fan of bases in general, this one is alright, though there are several better from this era--<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6953-1/Cosmic-Laser-Launcher"">#6953</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6972-1/Polaris-I-Space-Lab"">#6972</a> come to mind, and of course&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6987-1/Message-Intercept-Base"">#6987</a> though I&#39;ve personally never owned that one.</span></p>

"joshcvt","2015-04-02T03:33:51.293Z","Somewhat odd overall design, but inspired details.","<p>It&#39;s tough for me to treat this set analytically -- it was at least tied for my favorite large set with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6990-1/Monorail-Transport-System"" style=""font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">6990:&nbsp;Monorail Transport System</a>&nbsp;as a child, and I loved the design of the Space Police I theme. &nbsp;That said, let&#39;s go!</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Generally OK instructions in the standard A4-ish&nbsp;size. &nbsp;They earn a&nbsp;few minor markdowns because the sparse design,&nbsp;long plates and predominance of dark colors&nbsp;in this set make it very easy to misalign&nbsp;the odd&nbsp;1x2 or 2x2, particularly ones attached to the underside of a long plate. &nbsp;Guide lines through the attachment points&nbsp;or bracketed stud counts would have been nice, but TLG didn&#39;t generally do that in this era.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Long plates. &nbsp;SO MANY long 2 x&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;plates. &nbsp;The side brackets (black and trans-red) are nice, and black angled supports are good for plenty of things. &nbsp;Good black/blue mix, and the half-size baseplate&nbsp;is nice to have. &nbsp;Bonus points for not relying heavily on the interlocking-finger hinges so common in the era, and so easily broken as years of attic&nbsp;temperature fluctuations&nbsp;and/or UV exposure take their toll on the ABS plastic.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two SP1 officers and a Blacktron baddie. &nbsp;Classics. &nbsp;Not a harsh word for&nbsp;these guys.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s the good stuff. &nbsp;Especially on a design so visually sparse, the design techniques were a revelation for the time and level of set&nbsp;and&nbsp;upped the grade of what could have been&nbsp;a pretty boring build.</p>

<p>The mini-ship looks weak and pancake-flat until you mount the jail cell (horizontally, of course) on its back -- but it goes back to the&nbsp;strength of the mount design that a ship largely just 4 plates thick holds it securely&nbsp;without requiring stud lockdown or a Technic pin. &nbsp;With the jail cell attached, the ship has a solid presence and feel. &nbsp;When the ship lands, the fueling post&nbsp;swings down and locks it into place. &nbsp;Everything around the little ship just works despite it looking simple at first glance -- a microcosm of its parent set.</p>

<p>The jail cell doesn&#39;t require much breakdown -- excellent use of tiles for solidity despite the hinges swinging open and closed, the trans-red antennae as cell bars hold their alignment unexpectedly well, and the mount points on the back are unobtrusive and secure. &nbsp;Good work.</p>

<p>Then you get into the set itself. &nbsp;Unless you studied the cover closely, for a good long while you won&#39;t really understand where the opened-out satellite arm is going or why the giant hinges are required. &nbsp;Keep going. &nbsp;The point where the satellite arm&nbsp;swings up, mounts&nbsp;into place against the pins on top and the crank finally moves&nbsp;the entire assembly&nbsp;through its paces is one of the great&nbsp;<em>eureka</em>&nbsp;moments in Lego building. &nbsp;On top of those mounts, using laid-down fence pieces to secure the antenna farms&nbsp;to vertical&nbsp;(and locking down on studs adjacent to the antennae) is the technical cherry on top. &nbsp;Unusual, satisfying, and good-looking.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s been said, but the concept of this set is a little odd -- mounting the prisoner&#39;s cell on top of the base, exposed to the elements? &nbsp;No real enclosed space for the officers to relax, maybe take off their helmets&nbsp;and have a space donut? &nbsp;May as well not think too hard about that. &nbsp;Just enjoy turning the crank and swinging the entire system through a full&nbsp;range of motion (and one securely blocked at its ends -- you&#39;d have to work hard to break it&nbsp;or take it off the rails).</p>

<p>You can make it&nbsp;a little more visually interesting by building on a classic moon crater baseplate -- the support mount points nicely straddle one end of the ridge.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It seems like there should be more negative things to say about this one, but they&#39;re hard to find after you work through the build. &nbsp;About the best I can do for criticism is that the reliance on long plates makes for a sparse look and maybe a bit flimsy structure -- I do recall it not being very secure against assault by 4-7 year old siblings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On the whole, though? &nbsp;A classic. &nbsp;Zero regrets making this the pinnacle of my&nbsp;recent rebuild project.</p>
