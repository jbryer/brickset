"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T23:31:32Z","","This is a very strange looking set, what can I say, but it is one of the coolest M-Tron sets there was. The thing I like best about it is a cool double front window that bends in half. IN any case, I feel like kicking myself in the head every time I think about how I destroyed mine like an idiot when I was little... Oh well. Nice set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-02-27T10:44:02.11Z","Star Wars Envy","This was a great set.  I still have all of the parts.  Recently I was building something with the pieces, and my wife wanted to know why so many of the black pieces I was building with had caked on dust all over it.  I told her it was because the Voyager spent much of it's 27 year career in my care, built as the Voyager.  It was a big set with some very unique pieces.  Those almost glowing flourscent green pieces were outstanding, and with magnets all over the ship to hold boxes and the little rover, it was amazing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-22T20:43:33.013Z","Interesting and great fun.","This is one of those sets which is unconventionally attractive.  It has an unusual and interesting design, makes good use of pieces (including magnets) and it's nice to see those double-angled wall/window pieces again.  It's also nice to see Space sets making use of red pieces (maybe it's just because I'm a fan of Red Dwarf).  The only thing that could have been improved on is the positioning of the buggy - the spacecraft flies through the stars with a car sticking out of its nose.  Still, it's a great set, and easily blows away those ugly Star Wars ships.

"M_Tron_Hero_Kodiak","2008-12-23T00:32:52.7Z","Good Ship.","I feel that this set, is the ultimate in all space ships in the lego space catergory (save for the old school space cruiser).

M-Tron can transport their goods fast and far.
This set is very fun and will provide long hours of fun.  Over time though, the hinge for the crane becomes weak from use.  Only bad part of the entire set.


A Crew of two seems to fit very well.
For Movement: The SRV has a lot of power.  This ship would be able to beat Tie Interceptor speed!!
Maneuverbility: Only a few space thrusters, but more than enough of atmospheric control surfaces.  
Armor: Pretty beefy, again should be able to take some punishment.
Weapons:  I can only see 4 weapons total, or at least look like weapons.
Firecontrol, sensors, communication: Has two antenna's, and one computer tile.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-20T17:14:34.2Z","Out of the ordinary is good on this ship","An unusual design serves this ship wonders (though in my opinion the particle ionizer looks cooler). This ship is great. The rover is cool, but without the minifigure on it, it cannot hold the crates without tipping over. The crane is awesome and the use of magnets makes this set very fun. The design on this ship is great, just enough boosters, and the cockpit is really cool since the doors on the side defy the standard bottom top cockpit used in similar ships later in SP II. This is one of the last sets to use the classic space windows and convexes which are slightly bulky but don't over complicate the cargo hold, plus have plenty of other uses when rebuilding the set. I can't imagine the horrors of what would happen if the set had three figures...
My worst gripe is that the tools are hard to get out of the crate, and the wrench tends to slide partway into the holes. The crate could have been used for another purpose, but is fine the way it is.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"fff","2010-11-29T04:45:00.65Z","When M-Tron ruled the galaxy ... ","The photo of the ship in the booklet is tricky. The view is terrific, it does not look it has morea than 100 and fewer parts. However it is 233 pieces and 2 M-Tron-friendly minifigs. So it is really not that small.<br><br>Red and black, beautiful, accompanied by a transparent yellow appearance, giving it a luminous feel which fits very well. And like its fellow the bigger Core Magnetizer, with 7 / 8 magnets. Too many perhaps?<br><br>Typical space pieces. Great!<br><br>As extras artifacts we could highlight the trunk of tools hanging on the crane and incorporated into the rear of the ship, 2 mini kits, also magnetized and a small land vehicle.<br><br>So the spaceship it is reaaly worth the money. It won't disappoint you.<br><br>Additional photos (you can have a better look)<br><br><a href=""http://ligandoladrillos.blogspot.com/2010/03/lego-6956-stellar-recon-voyager.html"">http://ligandoladrillos.blogspot.com/2010/03/lego-6956-stellar-recon-voyager.html</a><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"ezehogan","2014-01-19T23:36:26.813Z","Strange but Great Set","A friend of mine had this set years ago when I was a kid back in the mid 90's. I had always wanted the M-Tron sets but had received mostly castle sets in my younger years. When I finally saw this beauty in person the M-Tron sets were long gone from store shelves. In the mid 90's discontinued LEGO sets were not easy to come by so I had to long for this for years.<div><br></div><div>The design is great. Very interesting to look at with a lot of play features. Magnets, the crane, storage containers, and the largest ship cockpit I have ever seen make this a kids dream come true. I remember my friend had 4 M-Tron figures crammed into the cockpit of his vessel as we took it on straffing missions against an enemy chemical plant.</div><div><br></div><div>The set is not without its flaws. The car on the front is a strange decision, and the rear does have quite a bit of wasted space. I can't help but feel that the rover could have fit back there in the main design, but these are all minor gripes.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this is a classic design from a great era in LEGO Space.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
"Faefrost","2014-09-15T01:14:28.163Z","The chunky yet attractive trash hauler","<p>Ah Mtron. If only they would revisit Legos delightful merchant marine corp. the 6956 is the largest regular flyer of the Mtron theme (the Flagship being the wheeled Mega Core Magnetizer). I&#39;m not sure if the Mtron &quot;super ship&quot; is technically larger as I never had a chance to build that 3 into 1 design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This baby is Lego Spaces one true dedicated trash hauler. Moving goods across&nbsp;the solar system. As such it lacks the sleekness of the explorers and war fighters. Yet that just adds to its charm. It sports that reach out and grab you Mtron color scheme of red black and trans neon green (yellow?) that just makes the whole thing glow like the cover of a bad 90&#39;s comic book. (Google Tony Stark, mullet).</p>

<p>it sports a crew of two, but the cockpit is spacious enough for a few more. The basic lines of the ship somewhat recall the 6985 Cosmic Fleet Voyager, with the chunky angles in the corners and its&nbsp;mostly wingless linear design. The SRV is a bit sleeker than 6985 however. Sporting an assortment of fins and sensors and antennae all slaved around a rear biplane type small wing arrangement that really prevents it from being too boxy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 4 magnet connect points on the ship. One on the rear cargo lifter, two on each side of the cockpit for small cargo boxes, and one between the nose mandibles to hold a small magnetic cargo mover buggy. Basically a space forklift. The front position of the buggy is strange and off putting at first, but it grows on you. It more than anything else is what grabs you and screams this is a working cargo ship. It emphasizes that this is civilian and not another space fighter. &nbsp;The use of the red lattice fence pieces along the cockpit also add to the distinctive non combat look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back half is aesthetically odd. It is a large open enclosure made from those angled space wall/window frames with no glass. Sitting inside is a strut with a magnet sitting on top of a hinge plate. This acts as a cargo lifter. It tilts down to grab the cargo pod from ground level and lifts and holds it in the bay. The downside is the rear bay has a lot of unused real estate even with the cargo loaded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The he ship, much like the Deep Freeze Defender sits on an array of small jet engine pods that act as landing skids. Not my favorite design but effective in this case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons, other than they probably could have made better use of the cargo bay by forgoing the lift crane, my only other negative is it rattles a lot when swooshing. All of the cargo is simply dangling from magnets without actually sitting supported on anything. But once again it adds to the charm. This is a chunky hauler. Not a star fighter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a spectacular mid sized ship. It only suffers in comparison to its theme mates because of how awesome the entire theme is. It&#39;s a great ship but happens to be parked between the Particle Ionizer and the Megacore&nbsp;Magnetizer. Two of the all time great Space sets.</p>
