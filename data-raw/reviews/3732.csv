"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T14:58:58.89Z","another great SP2 set","This set has great form and function, and I fondly remember many hours rolling it around the house as a kid.  I like the fact that it has several parts: command cockpit, trailer, and a small craft that can carry the prison cell.  It's even better than the Galactic Mediator because it has none of the big ship's shortcomings.  If you don't have this set, I strongly recommend picking one up!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I don't get why there is a Blacktron minifig in this set. Maybe he was arrested. Besides that, this is very good and gets a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2009-02-12T19:48:30.873Z","A Fun Set with Great Colors","This set is very awesome!  The construction is simple, yet fun.  The large plastic wheels roll nicely, and the trailer/joint give it a snake like movement.  You get 2 cockpits on the main ship, and a detachable cell for prisoners.  The trailer has a breakaway spaceship that transforms between scout and hi-speed modes.  The best part about this set is the color scheme-- the black/red/grey with trans-green is a match made in Lego heaven.  The decorated slopes and tiles add a superior touch!

If you don't have this set, get it!  I love it so much that I have 2-- 1 for play, and 1 for show.

Pros:  Lots of wheels, cool colors, multiple parts

ONLY Con:  Blacktron fig was an afterthought",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-24T16:53:02.03Z","not too shabby","this set shows that space police 2 had some decent sets

Pros: neat design and little ship

the name is perfect for the design

nice wheels

cons: still has the bad space police 2 color scheme

blacktron minifig should have been a space police one",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"wakproductions","2009-07-25T17:46:04.937Z","Awesome ""tank""","This set is a great for ground battles.  It is perfect for tank combat with other land vehicles such as the Spyrius robots or the Spectral Starguider (Blacktron 2).  the trailer detaches, allowing this to separate into two ground vehicles, or, to launch the airborne reconnaissance vehicle.  Like the Rebel Hunter, the airborne vehicle can pick up the holding cell.  Another cool feature is that the flying part has great swooshability like Rebel Hunter.  

However, I always wondered how the Space Police would transport their ground vehicles between planets?...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Faefrost","2014-07-28T20:10:09.883Z","Very cool very strange vehicle","<p>One of the better Space Police 2 sets. A strange yet awesome land crawler Police vehicle. It is an absolutely incredible space ground vehicle that looks perfectly at home roaving over desolate alien landscapes. The colors are fantastic. The parts amazing these days. That trans green is to die for. The dual canopy is fantastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is a 2 part tractor trailer arrangement that we have seen many many times in Lego Space. Most recently in the totally awesome 7066 Earth Defense HQ from Aliens Conquest. This is one of the better interpretations of the layout. The lead tractor has the sleek pilot compartment followed by one of SP2&#39;s modular prisoner cells. The real trailer is mainly a flatbed that carries a small to mid sized flyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest disconnect with the set comes from it&#39;s name and also from the theme to which it belongs. They call this thing the &quot;Solar Snooper&quot; which leaves one suspecting that the naming committee back at Lego HQ was simply throwing darts at words taped up on a dart board. Because this thing has nothing to do with &quot;Solar&quot; and beyond a pair of basic antennae&nbsp;is completely incapable of snooping. Even weirder it is a Space Police vehicle, which seems to really have no effective police purpose? This massive 12 wheeled ground assault military vehicle to transport 1 prisoner? Looking at it the closest guess I have for its intended purpose is someone looked at one of Lego City&#39;s ubiquitous semi annual &quot;police helicopter transporter trucks&quot; (absurd in and of themselves but loaded with play value) and said &quot;let&#39;s make one of those IN SPACE!&quot; (please feel free to insert heavy baritone reverb voice for those last 2 words).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truck is fantastic even if it has no interior and few major features besides being a massive planet crawling truck. The flyer has a few issues. The biggest being the strange way it accordian folds in the middle and uses just the curved hinge nub on the inner facings of its two arms to lock in and hold the transport cell. This is a design that it shares with 6897 Rebel Hunter. Unfortunately unlike the Rebel Hunter which had some technic axles along the top stabilizing the whole accordion mechanism front to rear, this flyer does not share that feature. Making it a bit tricky to keep in one shape. It is inherently&nbsp;unstable. Abd loading and unloading the prison pod is awkward, with it having to be done at an arbitrary point mid transformation with the whole thing flexing and folding every which way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are 2 Space Police 2 officers and 1 Blacktron 2 prisoner (who seems way too creepily happy about the whole thing. It&#39;s like they&#39;ve captured the Joker.)</p>

<p>Overall an awesome set and one of the best of the arguably strange SP2 line. Sleek and Menancing as it crests over the alien landscape.&nbsp;</p>

"BelgianBricker","2019-11-11T13:53:18.713Z","In search of a worthy successor","<p>Lego has - in the past -&nbsp;&nbsp;managed to give us great follow-ups of existing themes: The second pirate wave, Blacktron next generation or the second Western wave just to name a few. They managed to follow in their &quot;parents&quot; foot steps and tilt the themes to a higher level.</p>

<p>Space police II&nbsp;however, the successor of the first brilliant Space Police theme, did not. The sets missed creativity and inspiration and&nbsp;the color-scheme was anything but pleasing to the eye, thus failing&nbsp;both aspects the first Space Police wave mastered in:&nbsp;fabulous sets (SP-striker, mission commander) and a superb color scheme (trans red, blue and black)</p>

<p>Things got even worse in the third wave, but let&#39;s not go there: the real world is a bad enough place as it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;Solar Snooper&quot; - what&#39;s in a name? - is probably the worst of the series. I got this for Christmas a long time ago and even then, being a child,&nbsp;did not like it one bit. I built it only once, and then kept the entire thing in a box on the attic for about 25 years...<br />
I don&#39;t blame my parents: little did they know: the thing probably looked cool in their eyes, I had a bunch of SP I sets and set 6086 black knight&#39;s castle was probably too expensive.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the review.<br />
<br />
There are so many things wrong with this set:</p>

<p>-lame build: few interesting pieces and most of them being giant, 1-piece monstrosities. It is devoid of every bit of genius or magic that sparkled the original space police theme. Sure, the trans-green windshields look&nbsp;nice, but the trans-red onces look/looked&nbsp;so much more vicious and mean. The 12 tires are also sweet, but it is not enough to count as a redeeming factor.</p>

<p>-uninteresting split into two even lamer vehicles: seriously, the ground vehicle seems to be nothing more then a flatbed truck transporting a flimsy airplane. A plane, that is so badly build, you cannot keep it to stay in one&nbsp;form or shape. It wobbles, twists and turns, wrinkles en folds non-stop...arch....<br />
The &quot;truck&quot; is not much better: you get a double canopy and......that&#39;s about it. No extra tools or computers, nothing to ad play-value, no extra interesting rooms or spaces...nothing...it&#39;s an empty shell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-boring color scheme. Oh where did the aggressiveness go from the first wave? That trans red in combination with the blue and black was so in your face. It screamed law and order, it made clear that these guys did not fool around. A few years later, nothing has remained: Instead of aggression, viciousness and speed we get sloth, boredom and a color scheme that would be more suitable for a Jamaican hippy circus than a police force. Even the set names make clear that Space Police II are made up of a bunch of wussies: the &quot;snooper&quot; and the &quot;Mediator&quot;!? Where did the &quot;striker&quot; and the &quot;commander&quot; go?</p>

<p>No no NO! Space Police II is a theme that must be forgotten, as fast as possible and no amount of printed &quot;space police&quot; pieces, green windshields or&nbsp;wheels will ever make me change my mind!</p>
