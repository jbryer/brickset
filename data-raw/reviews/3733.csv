The base seems like it was cut in half, so i bought 2 and put them togeather. this gives a much more satisfying look. The base overall is good, the rover has a telescope, but im shure everyone uses it as a gigantic death lazer killamabeam. The V craft is cool, and the magnet can hold its own wait, so stick it on the fridge :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-21T02:17:28.333Z","Great-looking base","The Explorien range contained some good sets and this is no exception.  The base, with its clever opening mechanism and its blue-and-red containers for examining the hologram pieces, is great, and there are some nice vehicles as well.  The little spacecraft, with its magnet, can be attached to anything metal.  A great set which looks as though it could almost have been one of the Futuron line-up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-04-24T19:45:20.907Z","Great base, although somewhat empty.","The Android Base is a fairly solid, medium-large base. It includes many white, trans-blue, and trans-neon-green Space elements, the usual Explorien fare.

We'll start with the main base unit. The base has a large radar dish assembly at the top, complete with holographic stickers. The dish can raise, lower, and rotate. Underneath the radar dish is an assembly of Technic elements that allow the doors of the base to open, while moving the radar dish forward (Cool!). Inside the base, there is a 2 x 2 slope brick with a computer screen on it, and a 4 x 4 plate with a large holographic sticker to make up the screen (Also cool!). The base itself is largely empty, but this is so that it can house a telescope-carrying vehicle included in the set.

The aforementioned vehicle is a standard Space rover piloted by a single astronaut, but it has a large telescope on the back that can be manned by a second minifigure. The telescope raises, lowers, and rotates just like the radar dish on top of the base, not to mention there is another plate with a holographic sticker next to the telescope, presumably for relaying the image.

A small V-shaped craft with a magnet on the front is also included in the set, and can be used to pick up fossil plates and put them in a small storage area near the base.

Figures include The Explorien chief, a standard astronaut, and a cool android.

Now for the bad part of this set: It is only half a base! If you look at the back of the set, you can see that it looks like a larger base cut in half. If you want to buy a second set, this could be fixed.

Nevertheless, the Android Base is a great Space base worth around 40-50$ to me. If you see it going for such a price, I would encourage you to pick it up!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-01-05T20:22:21.61Z","Paranoid Android ","This is one of the best space bases to ever come out from the Lego Company. Space was still a great theme and the Exploriens sets showed us that the theme can go on. The windshield is very cool and is also a rare piece which is great if you own it. The vehicle is also a nice part of this set with a moving turret and the spacecraft is pretty good too. If you had only ten Space sets, this should be one of them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-21T10:12:57.06Z","SWEET","This set is awesome! My mom got it for 5$ at a yard sale. Unfortunately, some pieces and the hover craft were missing. Anyway:
Pros:
+Awesome doors
+Tank fits perfectly inside base 
+Pieces change color
+Ann Droid included!
+Press button and doors close
Cons: 
-Tank weapon is a little to big

But over all, 11 out of 10. If you don't have this set, get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-19T10:48:01.777Z","One of my Favorite Sets","<p>The Exploriens Android Base was my first set of the Exploriens theme, and I'm definietely hooked now. A great set if you can get it for less than $60. With nice Classic Space parts and some cool minifigs, this is a very good set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explorien Chief: He's nice, but not the best space leader I've ever seen. The helmet's cool, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explorien: A nice minifigure to enhance the playability, but nothing really too special. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Ann Droid"": The pun is rediculous. LEGO officialy named it ""Ann Droid"", because it's a girl android. I'm not sure how androids can have genders, but whatever. The figure is actually the best figure in the set, though. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is mainly a control center enclosed with some kind of crystaline dome, a fossil examination station, the commander's private vehicle, and a laser/fossil finder vehicle. The control center has two very nice pieces inside: a control screen with a planet and a red dot on it, and a really neat hologram piece. The hologram, when moved back and forth, changes color and shows an Explorien spaceman. Outside of the base is a fossil viewer, with two very rare pieces. Believe it or not, the red viewscreen piece is only found in two other sets, and the blue viewscreen piece is only found in three other sets. The fossils inside are O.K., but a little difficult to hold since they're stickers. This was when LEGO entered ""The Dark Times"". When they began to always use stickers instead of printed pieces :). The first vehicle is the commander's private space ship, and it's a nice little vehicle. The second vehicle, in my opinion, should be kept in the base at all times and never taken out, since it adds so much to the base. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, LEGO Android Base is a nice set, although you really need like a UFO or Insectoids set to have it at its full potential. The Warp Wing Fighter, which I have, goes great with it. The set, though, without one or two of its concurrent factions (In this case, Unitron, Roboforce, UFO, or Spyrius) is really not that playable, but still a nice set. Overall, this set is great, if, and only if, you can get it for the right price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
