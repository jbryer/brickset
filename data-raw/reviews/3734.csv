The ships are nice too! The trap door is awkward, but is nice. The cool baseplate with the window are sweet! NICE SET!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-03-24T19:15:04.98Z","5/5 get or you're missing out","i got this set on ebay for about 20.00 ( relatively cheap for it nowadays), and have loved it ever since.  The set was the king of the spyrius' reign in my opinion.  I always loved the bases because it gave all of the space ships and saucers and rovers and other craft a place to stop to rest or exchange information.  the base has pretty much everything it requiers.  it has an elevated baseplate, a rocket launch station that is cleverly hidden inside a rock pillar, two vehicles ( a small rover and a small reconaissance saucer craft), three figures to man the base and its vehicles, a large window panel with radio equiptment, and a platform behind the windowpane with controls and other equiptment.  Some of the down falls may be that the large sticker peels if you do not place it right, and the base should have had a little more behind the panel and some larger vehicles ( as stated by another reveiwer for this set).  Overall, i highly recomend this set, because you will absolutely love it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickzone","2007-05-07T06:40:48.967Z","This rocks!","I did not appreciate Spyrius at the time, it seemed weak compared to the previous themes. I shouldn't have let that influence me. If you see this set firsthand, it is every bit a proper Lego space base. It may not be as extensive as a custom model, but for a Lego set it is good.

First the &quot;hidden&quot; rocket inside the rocks is a nice touch, and the focus of the base. The control room is pretty plain, but on the plus side there's plenty of room (it's a good layout) so you can add your own touches. Also there is a kind of control area on the &quot;launch pad&quot; behind the rocks; this interestingly has a trapped floor that can be retracted. Not immensely clever, but straight out of a stereotypical movie; great for play value! The kind of tower structure at the back looks well too with the support pillar, lights, tubing and radar dishes. Finally, this particular baseplate colour; black with the grey craters, is pretty cool.

I do find the colour scheme quite smart even if not as distinctive as say Blacktron II, Ice Planet 2002 or Space Police II. On its own merits it works well. Certainly black and red parts are very reusable for custom sets!

If this set had been cheaper at release, more people might have got it and been pleased with it. I think it is at present, like other Spyrius sets, underrated.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-31T18:05:13.28Z","A Perfect Base","The villians in any spy film should have a base like this. You get a missile launcher and the rocks cover it up which is very villian like. The driveway for the vehicle is pretty cool, but Lego didn't have that in mind. This is a perfect base with no flaws and deserves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2009-06-27T18:10:43Z","It doesn't quite hit the mark, nevertheless, it isn't bad","The spyrius base just doesn't look very....spyrius.

Pros: the little rover have a nice design, and i like how the base has a ramp for it. I also like how the base is high-tech looking and has a bit of an ""evil"" look, which fits.

Cons: the base itself isn't much of a base, and i HATE the ""technalgy in the rocks feature ""also present in the unitron base.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"holeymoley85","2009-12-09T09:01:50.78Z","The anti-climax","I loved the spyrius range, it is my favorite of all the space ranges, i had every model and could'nt fault them(the saucer centurion was a wee bit flimsy, but that just added to the effect if you had to 'crash land'!) this was the very last spyrius set i got as a kid, it was also the last of my spyrius collection to get.

so when i got it i was well excited! The box looked fantastic, and i set about building it.

The bule glass section is pretty cool, with its little control center, but compared with other space bases, its rubbish! Why a satellite? why not a fighter craft, you can't put a minifigure in a satellite! in fact all you could do with the satellite was launch and waggle the 2 aerials on it. Wheres the multi levels that other bases have.

It gets 2, 1 for being made of lego, another for having that funky blue quarter dome androck face elements.

It certainly is'nt the worse set ever made by lego, but considering how much play value was packed into the other spyrius range models, this is a certain dissapoint. one for the space collectors methinks.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"davee123","2016-08-19T22:01:11.59Z","A Collection of Play Features","<p>This set is largely on par with the other space bases of the time-- there isn&#39;t much structure to it, it mostly revolves around several play features.</p>

<p>The main feature is the opening mountain, which I didn&#39;t think was as impressive as many of the other comparable bases of the day.&nbsp; The forward section of the mountain pulls forward when you move the docked spacecraft, and a &quot;lock&quot; releases the rear half of the mountain so that it can tilt backwards slightly.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another panel underneath the rear half of the mountain, which initially appears to be part of the mountain mechanism (and had me excited that it would be nicely complex), but it turns out simply to be a &quot;trap door&quot;, allowing a minifig to fall into the pit below.&nbsp; This may be the only space set with a trap door, interestingly!</p>

<p>A small gate blocks the top of the ramp, allowing the rover to roll down-- cute, but again, not terribly interesting.&nbsp; Plus, there&#39;s a wall/door that opens behind the large canopy, and a small knob that allows you to spin the radar dish on the top of the structure.</p>

<p>There are surprisingly few elements in the set, although there are a bunch of large ones (4 BURPs, the raised baseplate, and the large canopy).&nbsp; Apart from the sticker, none of the elements are unique (although its red-finned rocket used to be unique), and most are fairly common.</p>

<p>I felt rather underwhelmed by this set upon finally building it, especially when comparing to other Spyrius sets and space bases of the era.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-28T05:23:03.9Z","LEGO Space (Spyrius) - Lunar Launch Site Review","This is a fun set and a collector's item. It's also the only LEGO Space (Spyrius) set I've got so far. It comes with three rare minifigs which looks really cool. I like the way how LEGO designed the face for the cyborg minifig who has the red torso and red legs. The next cool thing about this model is how LEGO printed the base plate. The mountain can be opened if you pull a lever and in there you can see a small rocket. In the front of the mountain is also a platform where you can put the saucer which comes in this set. The windscreen can be opened and there's a cool laser gun in the front. The third vehicle is a rover. The rover is very small and it has 6 tyres. If you dont want to use it you can put it on the top of the base plate. The If you want to get this vehicle up you can open the gate on the top. <br><br>Another cool piece is the translucent blue window which is a huge big piece which I haven't seen in any LEGO sets we got today anymore. This window piece has one stickers. It's the only sticker we get in this set by the way. The wall with the antennas and the radar does open and the radar on the top sviwels full 360Â°. It's a cool set and worth the money. It's a fun set to play with and a fun build.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
