"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-25T20:40:51Z","Too Expensive but SAAAAWWWEEEET","Found these at the local Japanese market in Los Angeles where I buy all my toy with candy (or Gashapon or Chogokun).  They're $7.25 apiece, and since the X-Wing and Slave 1 look to be reuses, this set was the only one I purchased.

The set has a TON of pieces that really make a sweet looking Tie-Interceptor to go along with your Tie fleet.  Plus it comes with some odd-tasting gum...and a Japanese language catalog sheet, which is nice.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-22T09:24:25Z","Just gotta love this","Really cool, stands nice with my other TIE mini's. Especially like the painted hatch piece on top (you get two of those, used the second one on my mini scale TIE Fighter 3219). 
O and Will, if you want to have em all, only the X-wing is actually a re-issue, the Boba Fett Slave I has completely different colors than the Jango Fett Slave I you may already own.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:41:30Z","Fastest Ship in the Imperial Arsenal!","       This ship rocks! It really sucks that they havent released a regular scale TIE-Interceptor to complete the TIE family, but I assume they will! This imini-model is the only lego resource of the Intercepter! It has the pylon light lasers and the cool dome as the cockpit canopy! Very nice starfighter! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-10T18:20:25Z","Very cool mini"," I got the mini tie interceptor as a free bonus when I bought the droid tri-fighter at Toys R us. It's definitely one of my favorite minis. It's accurate, well built, and just looks awesome. I also like the detailed hatch piece, and the fact that it comes with two of these pieces so I can put one on my mini regular tie. A must have for every Lego Starwars mini collector.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Doctor_Sinister","2007-05-09T14:51:17.523Z","Wow!","Four days ago, I didn't even realise this set was out there...amazing how you can go from total ignorance to complete lust in an instant.

Anyway, one eBay transaction later and here I am, the proud owner of one of these little kits and having only possessed it for five minutes, it's already one of my favourites.

I like this site...

"vezon8764","2008-10-23T19:13:59.717Z","Sweet set!","This comes with a new 1x1 tile panel that looks like a cockpit cap, and unfortunately, the viewport is just like the others: a clear dish. I do like the wing design, and how it looks so like the minifigure-sized Tie Interceptor.
Pros:
Cheap
Sweet
Some new pieces
Cons:
Even though it is a mini set, it is too small, and the Imperial Shuttle(mini) has it beat.
See you next review!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legoz","2009-01-02T16:08:21.357Z","pretty cool","This set was really cheap and probably worth the price. There are no stickers, thank you lego, but the designs are printed on the pieces. This set collects dust on my shelf, but its good use is for making a lego movies. Still a pretty good set over all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Suukorak12","2009-03-29T15:24:01.95Z","Very cool star wars tie","I really enjoy this set. it is very small but very fun. it looks just like it's supposed to! The wings tend to fall off and there are no stickers! I reccomend you buy this set. I give this cool set 5 stars.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
