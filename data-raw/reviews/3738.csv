"Korik4","2009-11-04T13:42:11.5Z","Rather good space set","   First off, this ship looks very cool once built. Very slick and the colours contrast with each other nicely too. I am a fan of the large speceships that detach into smaller ships, (The Ice planet Deep freeze defender being the prime example) and this is a fine addition to that group. The wings are a splendid little touch, it gives the model a slight degree of personalisation, that some models tend to lack.

   There's a lot of interesting pieces in this set, unfortunately I'm petrified of any of them breaking, especially the wings and antennae. The magnets are a nice idea, although the sliding storage compartment tends to come loose and rattle around a lot. The sounds on the electronic part could have been better too.

  In all, this is a very good set, although there are some slight negatives which stop this from being a great set. Definately worth a look if you see it cheap.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"robuko","2010-02-14T00:16:10.123Z","This set has converted me to become an insectoids fan","<p>This is my first insectoids set.&nbsp; I had stayed away from them because of the specialised pieces, and I have to admit that only I bought this because of the very cool minifigs.&nbsp; The set was a very positive suprise.&nbsp; The colour scheme looks really good, much better in reality than on the box picture.&nbsp; The nose piece is trans yellow not orange as shown, though it lights up red.&nbsp; The magnetically attached scout ships are simply brilliant for playing, and the detachable front ship is very swooshable, especially in the dark where its pew-pew characteristics are at their best (although I agree the noises are not that super).&nbsp; All 6 printed wings are movable front-back and up-down, though not rotationally, and the sight of all of them extended for interstellar journeys is quite magnificent.&nbsp; The main body has plenty of computers and dials for the droids to puzzle over, 4 engines, and the secret crystal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost everything is printed, there are only 2 or 3 stickers on the crystals and they are tiny.</p>
<p>Any negative points? the front of the nose looks unfinished to me, it's not clear how the droids get out of their scout ships and on to the main ship, the cockpit is not enclosed, and the legs on the back don't do it for me; they are not well integrated into the design&nbsp; and they feel like an afterthought.&nbsp; When you buy insectoids, it is basically a bunch of specialised pieces and the trans yellow pieces are not to everyone's MOCing tastes.</p>
<p>I am giving this set a 5 brick rating overall because the playability is awesome.&nbsp; My 4 1/2 year old nephew spent all afternoon classifying some of my Christmas sets and his conclusion was clear, &quot;kore ha ichban kakkoi no&quot; which means, this is the coolest. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-31T05:15:59.727Z","LEGO Space (Insectoids) - Celestial Stinger Review","This is my largest and favourite LEGO Space (Insectoids) set I own. It comes with lot's of cool stuff like a sound effect for the big laser piece in the front (I don't know if the batteries you need come with this set or not). We also get some rare pieces like the translucent blue fins. We get a few smaller ones and two bigger ones. We also get some translucent yellow crystal pieces which have a sticker. These crystals are the only pieces which come with a sticker and they're also exclusive to the LEGO Space (Insectoids) theme so far. We get two gliders which have a nice screen and a cool translucent yellow dome. They also have a magnet which you can use to attach these gliders to the big spaceship. The big spaceship comes with some lasers, a small cockpit, very cool engines and a cargo area where you can store some crystals. The whole set is very sturdy and a very fun built.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"TheLEGOshogun","2012-05-24T13:06:40.897Z","A real insectoid classic!","<p>After buying this set via ebay I was very impressed however after a while the wings become loose and that does make this craft slightly bad. I love the wasp/bee style design and it really makes it a perfected insectoid classic. The build was boring but the playability kicks in after and I had a blast with this thing. The ship itself has 2 subcrafts which can be attached via magnet and this makes the set very cool. The light and sound feature is very impressive and it is also a customizeable ship.&nbsp;The value for money is slightly bad but there are many things in this set that make up for it. All in all 4/5 out of 5. </p><p><strong>Pros - </strong></p><p>Customizeable.</p><p>A real insectoid classic.</p><p>Sticks to the theme design.</p><p>Amazing playability.</p><p>2 subcrafts.</p><p>A good thing to add to your space/insectoid collection.</p><p>A real blast of fun ;3.</p><p><strong>Cons - </strong></p><p>Loose wings.</p><p>Expensive cost.</p><p>Slightly boring build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading :)</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
"Faefrost","2014-09-15T01:57:45.437Z","Distinctively different in Space","<p>The Celestial Stinger is one of the larger mid sized Space Ships Lego has put out. It has a nice sleek design, some rather interesting theme specific parts, and a kinda questionable gimmick that seems to work in context.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much like Mtrons&nbsp;Stellar Recon Voyager this is the Insectoids largest space ship. Their flagship set being a ground crawler. It&#39;s crewed by three. One Insectoids and 2 droids. The droids stand out as they both sport the trans clear 2nd gen space helmets. I think the only time those have appeared in a trans color? It gives them a really cool look.</p>

<p>the most noticeable element of the ship is the electronic &quot;Stinger&quot; that the whole thing is built around. It&#39;s a big piece about the size of a TV remote. In appearance... Let&#39;s put it this way, I had to back peddle and explain to my wife that &quot;no there was not some sort of exotic &quot;adult toy&quot; sitting on my Lego bench&quot;. She didn&#39;t believe me at first. The bulk of it is a large tapered slightly pointed shaft with two engraved clear pieces up the sides, which ends with a square Lego brick base. The shaft holds batteries and there are three buttons on the side which produce flashy lights and spacey laser sounds. Hours of enjoyment until mom yanks the batteries out to get some peace. The Stinger is by itself the front&nbsp;third of the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Behind the stinger sits the main cockpit for the Insectoid pilot. It is a partially enclosed cockpit in a neon green. The bulk of this area is constructed using dark grey Explorians type wing pieces. Behind and to either side of the main cockpit are two faux cockpits, which is one of the ships bigger disappointments. It would have been nice to seat the droids there. Everything from the three cockpits forward is modular and can detach to be a sleek fighter blasting away with the stinger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back section is a somewhat open cargo area with a cargo pod to hold energy crystals. Also in this section are two of the sets cooler features. The large blue insect like wings and the mini flyers. The wings are very adjustable but give the ship a sleek variable wing look. Somewhat resembling an F 14 Tomcat. They really are striking. Sadly they are also designed around the last generation of finger hinges, making the parts that hold them on among the most fragile Lego has ever made. I can&#39;t image the hinges held up well under heavy play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside the wings we have two neat little flyers held to the sides if the ship via Mtron magnets. The neon green 4x4 golf ball type domes give a nice impression of alien nacelles when docked. These also provide the seating for the droids. Sadly this seating is sideways. So you have space sick droids. You will find yourself obsessively popping these on and off to swoosh around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rear is dominated by a loading platform for the cargo pod (based on a trans blue half cylander) and a pair of mechanical grasshopper legs to maintain the whole insect look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall not a bad set. It is sleek yet exotic, with just a touch of an organic feel. I far prefer it over the later Galaxy Squad insect ships, which tend to just make me itch. The sets biggest cons are the stinger so dominates the set and there really isn&#39;t a lot in the way of interesting build. But it&#39;s got a rather varied grouping of unusual and interesting parts. (Granted not always the most useful, but interesting)&nbsp;</p>

<p>i think ink my biggest complaint with this set is I wish they had gone bigger. It&#39;s a nice mid sized set. But if they had poured a bit more budget and resources into it to make it the flagship it would have been one of the most memorable Space&nbsp;sets ever. I might take it on as a MOC / MOD project to scale it up and flesh it out. Fully realizing the three cockpits. It&#39;s got such gorgeous lines to it. It kind of reminds you of something from classic Anime like Macross. Not a perfect set, but good and affordable even aftermarket on Bricklink, and will stand out on your shelves.</p>
