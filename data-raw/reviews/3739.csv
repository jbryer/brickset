"ratz","2005-06-17T03:01:00Z","aint got no idea?","this seems to be the last of the idea books, sold seperately with a sticker sheet. it contains some fine models for trucks, but covers other themes like aquanauts and pirates a well. lego should definitely publish a new idea book, containing replacement stickers and ideas (of course...)!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The instruction are not very detailed and give you some general ideas about how to combine sets at the time of release to make new and interesting models. Its ok but not something you can't live without.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"dudeski","2022-07-11T16:44:46.98Z","Probably the last Idea Book and certainly the worst.","<p>In 1997 I got to&nbsp;my Dark Ages, but Lego was on the brink of them&nbsp;too. There were still some nice &ndash; though&nbsp;nowhere near great &ndash;&nbsp;sets being released, but also some real crap (e.g. 6554, 6549, 6250, ...). And Idea Book 697 is a clear illustration of the direction Lego was headed for in the next few years. There are a couple of decent&nbsp;builds in here (especially those in the Town and Space themes)&nbsp;but few&nbsp;that compare&nbsp;to the&nbsp;ideas in Idea Books 200, 250, or 260.Same goes for the dioramas on the pages. They just look like stuff any kid could do with random bricks. In the older books, the pages were full of elaborate buildings and vehicles that were truly inspiring, something to strife for &hellip;</p>

<p>The decay of the Castle and Pirate series is definitely visible in this book. The&nbsp;idea for Pirates in here is two canoes and a rowboat connected by a rope bridge and&nbsp;with a stone structure on top. Who came up with that? And WHY? The Castle idea is a gatehouse that cannot be closed because of a lack of doors or fences. If a kid comes up with that, that&#39;s fine, but an adult who gets paid to design Lego?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I still collected the Lego catalogues in the next few years, but I didn&#39;t see anything in there that I would have bought, even if I had been only 10. So this Idea book was a symptom of Lego not having a clear direction. I&#39;m glad that in the early 2000s, they got their act together and that I can now build a lot of great stuff &ndash; both new and old &ndash; with my cousins.</p>

It was released around 1997/8, and I clearly recall walking into the local department store with my parents as we browsed the LEGO. Then, in a stack, I saw a large group of these booklets and assumed I could just take one, so I did.</div><div><br></div><div>10 minutes later, we were out of the shop and I still had booklet in my hand. My dad wanted a look at it as we walked, so I passed it over, and as he glanced at the back, he suddenly realised there was a price listed on the back!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In no time at all, we had raced to the car and escaped town. I can only applaud my dad for not just sticking up for his son, but to have the cool-factor of not going back to the shop and giving it back! Afterall, who wants to pay Â£4 for a damn booklet?</div><div><br></div><div>As it is, the booklet is simply filled with products that were available at the time, and is really only beneficial for nostalgia. Still, the artworks nice and its a lovely trip down memory lane if like me, you loved the 1990's.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
