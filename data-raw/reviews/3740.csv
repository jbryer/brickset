The set already look like a complete one. The space control centre is great, the small monorail and the 4 minifigures Are amazing!, the space ship is one of the best classic space designs.
Once again thank to bricklink for given us to possibility of remake classic sets like this one.
I have to thing right know which classic space I want to built when I finish building  this one.

I think it is the best Classic Space station made, it has so many excellent details like the big screen and the monorail to get to the space ship. I found it very cool to have beds in the station and the trans-clear cup was nice too. I also liked the Classic Space flag. The radar dishes are great too.

"oldfan","2013-07-24T17:18:46.427Z","OMG! long before OMG! was a word...","I never had this set when I was young; it was too big and too expensive for my family to afford, so I had to make do with the likes of 462, 6861, and 6870 to satisfy my need for Classic Space LEGO. &nbsp;While those sets are fantastic and I'm glad to have them, you couldn't help but drool over the pictures of the mighty 6970 Beta-1 Command Base in the catalogs that came with the smaller sets, a larger-than-life image of the ultimate space base that made quite a large impression for being such a small picture. &nbsp;Oh, how I longed for a set with two (count-'em, two!) crater plates, a large building with multiple windows and state-of-the-art computer screens, a spaceship every bit as large as my 6861 (with about 95% parts compatibility between the two, just enough to transform the X-1 into a passable rendition of the Beta-1 defender as a MOC), and--get this--an actual MONORAIL TRANSPORT! &nbsp;How cool was that? &nbsp;Remember, this was way before 6990 was a gleam in a LEGO designer's eye; for the Beta-1, those old-style train-rail pieces became a mighty mode of transport in the airless confines of the distant planetary space outpost. &nbsp;Never mind that the whole thing was only maybe 40 studs long, and that it was probably quicker to walk to the launching pad from the main base rather than wait for the vehicle to cycle back and forth; this base has a MONORAIL!<div><br></div><div>Mind you, all this awesomeness in a 9-year-old's view came from a single picture in a catalog, and a single diaroma scene featuring all the LEGO Space sets at the time. &nbsp;My little mind was blown, and yet I despaired of ever experiencing the magnitude of the flagship space set in person. &nbsp;I would have to settle for the pictures and the dreams of what could have been...</div><div><br></div><div>Fast forward to 1999 and the release of Star Wars LEGO sets (and a sizeable increase in my personal disposable income from the late 70's...). &nbsp;After regaining my love for all things LEGO thanks to the SW license, my next task was to re-assemble Classic Space for myself; not just my long-lost sets, but all the big ones that eluded me in childhood. &nbsp;My sights were set on 497 and 6970 at the top of the wanted list, and sure enough, in time the Beta-1 Command Base was finally mine. &nbsp;I was fortunate enough to snag a copy with the full box packaging intact, so my initial impressions were as close to brand-new as I could get. &nbsp;Here's what I thought after I finally assembled the Beta-1 for myself:</div><div><br></div><div>-LEGO sure knew how to package sets back in the day. &nbsp;The plastic tray, with a formed lid included, has large and small compartments for storing the specialty pieces and mini-figures separate from the bulk bricks. &nbsp;The clear plastic teases the viewer with a glimpse of the massive crater plates stored underneath. &nbsp;Looks great in the box, and no need to waste a set of plastic baggies for parts organization thanks to the sealing lid.</div><div><br></div><div>-The spaceship was every bit as cool as I imagined. &nbsp;The wedge design looks sleek and dangerous, the oversized engines provide ample power for intercepting the unseen bad guys, the weaponry packs enough energy to take down enemy cruisers without outside assistance, and the cockpit is sufficiently roomy for the astronaut-pilot. &nbsp;(In my opinion, the ship actually looks better if you substitute out all the black and white elements for gray, but with this line of sets Classic Space was starting its transition away from blue-and-gray color schemes, so I accept the design for what it is.) &nbsp;The 4x3 printed space logo slope piece is only included in one other set (1580), and is the perfect size for this vehicle (the more common 2x3 printed slope is way too small for this design, and I'm glad LEGO included the larger one here).</div><div><br></div><div>-The two-crater-plate base takes up plenty of room on the floor or the desktop, but in reality the base itself is pretty small and only covers maybe half of the available 32x64 studded area of the plates. &nbsp;As with all LEGO sets (especially from this era), most of the fun comes in the imagination, and you do need to fill in the blanks to convince yourself that the Beta-1 is some kind of huge command base. &nbsp;However, all the elements are present to start you off: &nbsp;swivel control chairs, banks of computer terminals and a picture of the rocket base from 483, sleeping areas, a coffee mug, the requisite selection of hand-held tools,&nbsp;and multiple radar dish assemblies. &nbsp;The set even includes an old-school TV antenna piece! &nbsp;Lifting the entire base off of the crater plates using supports is a nice touch that implies a very craggy and uneven moon surface, enables the main building to be built partially atop the molded crater, and also helps the base to appear taller than it really is.</div><div><br></div><div>-The use of several Technic bricks in the build is puzzling. &nbsp;Those on top of the roof are completely unnecessary, and the use of pins as a stop for the monorail car on either end of the track could have been easily accomplished using traditional bricks and plates (although the pins are probably a more elegant solution). &nbsp;Was LEGO was advertising for its relatively new (at the time) Technic line, or did the designer like the way the holes in the bricks let the light shine through for a more open feel? &nbsp;Whatever the reason, it always just seemed strange to me to use those parts in 6970.</div><div><br></div><div>-The small ground vehicle is the same design as the units in sets 886 and 497/928; in fact, all the early Space theme ground vehicles generally use the same basic chassis design (and include the gray oxygen tank on the front; always nice to have an emergency spare for your roving astronauts!). &nbsp;Looking back, I think it's really cool that LEGO Classic Space had such a common design across all the sets, unlike today's themes which have few design features in common from set to set other than color (and not even that, sometimes). &nbsp;Of course a space agency would only have a single design platform for its vehicles; it's cheaper and more efficient for design/manufacturing, training, operation, repairs, etc. &nbsp;There is a real-world quality inherent in that simple 10-piece car. &nbsp;(note: this has nothing at all to do with the more limited element and color palette available to LEGO in the 1970's and 1980's, no sir...it's a deliberate and elegant/real-world design choice!)</div><div><br></div><div>-And finally, the flag with its unique, ultra-cool dark-blue stickers rests firmly in the center of the base in the crater plate valley. &nbsp;The ubiquitous logo proclaims to all that this planet belongs to Classic Space! &nbsp;Thank goodness, because compared to other Classic Space sets, 6970 has very few elements with the printed logo (a single 1x2 on the roof, and the printed slope on the spaceship). &nbsp;But the flag more than makes up for this lack of advertising on the building itself.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm happy to report that the Beta-1 Command Base still brings a smile to my face whenever I build the set or just look at the pictures. &nbsp;It looks great on display either alone or integrated within a larger collection, and maintains its rightful place as the flagship base unit of the theme. &nbsp;No Classic Space collection is truly complete without this set. &nbsp;If you have the means, acquire your copy and be inspired!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"cmd","2015-11-21T06:41:34.637Z","The best, most stylish set ever made.","<p>To this day, the pieces from this set are some of my all-time favorites. The design&mdash;visual, functional, and system&mdash;are unmatched in LEGO.</p>

<p>I got this set in &#39;81 or &#39;82 and the set as designed was a staple build throughout my childhood. The building is a diorama with expanses of smooth lines and&nbsp;wide-open spaces giving&nbsp;the impression of size and substance. The sleek, futuristic design, with tinted glass, that big video screen and computers throughout&mdash;and that dish on the roof&mdash;well, it was like the Nostromo&nbsp;before you were quite old enough to see Alien. The colors pop: the stark expanse of blue brick, accented with translucent yellow and bursts of green and red, projects an absolutely otherworldly aspect over the barren expanses of the baseplates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The visual design of this set is the best thing LEGO&#39;s ever done. One could lie on the floor, and from each&nbsp;angle, the set presented a different vista of visually interesting and engaging mechanics. The inner courtyard of cratered dunes, whence vehicles departed for expeditions. The long monorail ride&nbsp;to the launch pad, and then takeoff and flyover. The brutalist&nbsp;blue exterior glinting silent and yellow, watching over the alien wasteland.</p>

<p>All of these elements tantalize the imagination&mdash;and because it&#39;s LEGO, they function well, too. The ship is thoughtfully&nbsp;cradled, the monorail includes bumpers, and the dish&nbsp;rotates. It all feels well-integrated, there is a sense of purpose to the set. These things aren&#39;t just thrown together, there is a logic to how the LEGO people would be living and working here.</p>

<p>The two baseplates, which serve not to bound the set but to expand it, are genius. The existence of so much unused real estate&mdash;some of which you can&#39;t even build on&mdash;opens the set up, makes it feel much larger than it actually is. The transition from building to&nbsp;vehicle, and out into the sky or across the ground (and thence the floor and across the room) is natural, even inevitable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When mixed in with a collection, this set becomes a cornerstone. The baseplates, of course, are obvious&mdash;as is the dish, and the rocket engines of which one can never have too many. But this was the first time that many of us had ever seen swivel pieces, angle brackets, or Technic bricks; we cherished those parts, and the techniques they taught and inspired. And who could ever after find those translucent yellow windows and blue walls in a bin, and not be satisfied that they be deep-space -worthy, or equal to alien sandstorms? The set is full of ideas that spread throughout a collection, adding&nbsp;interesting new possibility to the kinds of things and ways one is prepared to build.</p>

<p>The Beta 1 Command Base is the best set LEGO has&nbsp;ever produced.</p>

"PhilBuilds","2022-11-21T14:55:35.603Z","The set that has it all...","<p>When I began&nbsp;researching the Classic Space theme with a view to starting a collection this set from 1980 immediately grabbed my attention. I knew this is where my Classic Space journey would begin. It&#39;s&hellip;.perfect. Or at least very nearly so. A set that really delivers on all levels. We&#39;re given a substantial base, with a control room and a living area. It&#39;s&nbsp;adorned with an array of communication equipment and&nbsp;elevated above not just one, but two, cratered base-plates. A small crew transport monorail links the base to a launch area where a spartan, fighter-like craft waits poised for the crew&#39;s next mission. A mini rover for exploring the base area and beyond completes the set. And that flag&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of these features combine to form a set with immense playability, the hallmark of these early Classic Space sets. Even if this was your only Lego set as an early 80&#39;s child, you had everything needed for endless hours of play. Just add imagination, as they say.</p>

<p>The overall design is sublime. The decision to elevate the base and have it&#39;s supports straddle the raised crater&nbsp;a stroke of pure genius. Thoughtful and effective flourishes, such as the outward and upward ribs on the rear elevation and the choice of technic pieces for the long spars give form and purpose to the base. This is a serious functional place in a hostile environment where curves are not required! The trans-yellow roof and control room window surveying the launch area set the base alight. It&#39;s hard to imagine a more effective colour palette&nbsp;for the theme.</p>

<p>A relatively large set for it&#39;s time, the array of interesting elements and beautiful printed parts give an enjoyable, satisfying build. And in just 16 steps for the base! There&#39;s really very little I&#39;d change. The winglets on the spacecraft are fixed. Foldable would have been nice. A technic axle and small cog in the base of the transit would make it run smoothly across the toothed monorail. But these are small observations and not criticisms of what is a truly beautiful and effective set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the collector, the good news is that this one won&#39;t break the bank. Although a very worthy addition to any Classic Space collection, the Beta I Command Base is not quite as collectible as the first wave 1978/79 sets and this is reflected in the current&nbsp;value. Nice examples are on offer for around the &euro;100 mark, and often a good bit less (2022). The stickered flag piece, antenna and large printed blue screen are pricey elements that you really don&#39;t want to find yourself sourcing and should be considered carefully before making a purchase. One that I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t regret.</p>
