"A_Brickset_user","2001-12-20T00:00:00Z","","I Always wanted this set and never got it.  I tried building it numerous times with the pieces that I had and couldn't come close.  It's another great set from 1984 that features a rocket, a bay for the rocket, a space ship, a small ground shuttle, and a control room.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T13:40:57Z","My longest awaited space set","I waited 5 years to get this at ebay...and then won 3!  This set has a plethora of outstanding pieces you won't find in many other sets, and the good news is they're all versatile!  

The set is more exciting than the other early 80's space stations and the best part has to be all the different coloured space figures!  I feel it exemplifies classic space at it's best because of that, and also because of the yellow windows, rocket, spaceship, baseplates and cockpit pieces!

I dare anyone who poo-poo's this set to find multiples of those yellow windows cheap!  They're just not easy to find outside of this set.  It's worth getting this set just for them and all the additional parts. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-05T06:47:11Z","Great Space Station","A great example of classic 80's space, I still remember getting this at TRU for about 40 bucks.  Interesting and original design with lots of useful pieces and playability.  I think that 6970 and this would go great together(now if I could just to find a reasonably priced 6970!)

How anyone could dislike this set so much is beyond me.  Any true lego fan knows its worth.  Sure the design's a bit strange, but c'mon..it's space!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"4TUN3","2007-03-28T15:12:37.63Z","Oh, yes...","...those huge yellow windows. Rare parts, that's for sure! Once I realized one of them was disappeared... then found it much later in the Lego bin of a 'friend' of mine, while we were playing in their house! Relationship terminated.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"grobrick","2013-08-11T17:50:34.393Z","Complete Base","A pure Classic Set.<br>2 base plate, blue an transparent Yellow, launching ramps, computers, opening roof, sliding rocket but the most innovative and funny thing is the way the radars are built on the top: check well which parts are used to make them.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T14:38:32.77Z"," Space Station! Space Station! SPACE STATION!","<p>I am going to start by admitting, this set annoys me as much as I love it. In fact the annoyance is because I&nbsp;love it. Why design it so the rocket hanger doors can&#39;t shut over the massive rocket???!!</p>

<p>My personal version is modded to add another level to the base and solve that problem.</p>

<p>Another annoyance is the open window frames. I spent a minor fortune buying spacres to fill those.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why did the tracking dishes point at the ground with a rocket and small spaceship to track?</p>

<p>The truth is that I think this is a flawed masterpiece. Many of my classic space is intact with no changes. But this has been modified noticeable to meet my standards.</p>

<p>The build is uninspiring as lego was simplier back then.</p>

<p>The parts list has many notables, including trans yellow, big windows, some 8 by 1 smooth tiles and two of the ever popular luna base plates.</p>

<p>The playability is huge. Rocket with a satelite on top. mini space ship and somekind of space scooter. A mission&nbsp;control buried in the heart of the base. Brilliant.</p>

<p>Pros -</p>

<p>Great for play. Can sit at the heart of all the launch pads from the likes of LL928 Cruiser and LL6980 Galaxy Commander creating an instant super base.</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>I listed em above. Don&#39;t let them detract from my love of this set.</p>
