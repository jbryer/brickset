"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-20T00:00:00Z","","Of all the large spaceships Lego have produced the Ice Planet flagship has got to be the best. The design of this ship is just so awsome it's difficult to comprehend. The modularity in this ship is just amazing. The ship is made up of four parts, two cockpit modules, a cargo area to carry the rocket and a larger cargo area to carry a little runabout. The ship can then be seperated into two smaller but equally potent looking medium sized ships. You can even set up a rocket base with the cockpit modules acting as ski vehicles. The possibilites for this ship are just endless, my description has only really scratched the surface. There are many Lego ships that use modularity but never have I seen it as well done as in this set. As if that wasn't enough the ship actually looks really good. Some large spaceships tend to look too bulky but this ship gives the impression of being very fast and manuverable despite its size. My only complaint is the ship could use a little more weaponry, especially at the front (Most of the weapons seem to be located at the back) Otherwise this is an absoloutly brilliant space set and very possibly the best space ship ever",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-17T12:37:12Z","Truly a classic!","Let me begin by saying that I think the IP '02 color scheme is brilliant, ranking right up there with Blacktron I.  It just feels &quot;icy&quot; to me.  The modularity of this ship is astounding.  MANY different combinations are available from just the basic model; with twin detachable cockpits, a missle silo/storage area, and a separate bay to launch a smaller ship from.  This set is also extremely swooshable, as one commentor stated.  I've given this thing a beating and have only knocked a sled or two, and maybe a long whip antenna piece.  My only complaint would be that the bay for the smaller ship, while ingenuitive, is perhaps a bit too crowded and hard to negotiate.  But even with that slight problem, I feel that this set (as well as the rest of IP) deserve high regards for being great, non-classic, non-black-and-yellow, space legos.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-12T22:32:12Z","A flagship among flagships","I hadn't been seriously into Lego for long, but I thought I had Space more or less figured. Then, what I saw in the 1993 catalogue shook my expectations to the ground. I don't know what it was, the minifigs and ice gear, the rocket/satellite systems or the so-very-different colour scheme, but Ice Planet 2002 were what made Lego number one in my view, and the undisputed king of the theme is the Ice Cruiser Zycon IV. Visually it is superb, people complain that the Ice Planet colour scheme is largely incompatible with other Space... well good! If 1993's new release had been yet another predominantly black, thoroughly unremarkable subtheme chances were I would have been far more apathetic about Lego than I am (please note, I was too young to know about Blacktron I and Space Police I!) But Ice Planet broke the mould, they tried something new and it was something awesome. The six, striking white wings give the ship both a sense of size and of sleekness, added to by all the little wing and fin greeblies. This is a model with swoosh to spare and contains parts for a myriad of other, equally swooshy MOCs. I was always kind of annoyed that the rocket for the satellite was different to the others, although this shorter design fits better on the VX162 (6898) and works fine with all the other vehicles equipped to carry rockets, it's just the little perfectionist in me doing the complaining. I guess the back section is kind of big for what it contains, but it manages not to look unwieldy at all, and the little shuttle raising mechanism is great fun. Then of course there's the modularity, probably the best individual example of it to date. Granted there are no other models to switch parts with, but the cockpits make awesome little pods on their own, and the ability to separate it into two large ships is just fantastic, plus they actually hold together steadily, something which many modular ships fail to acheieve. And as if all this weren't enough, you get a rare touch of (obvious) femininity in space, in the form of the fabled &quot;Ice Planet Babe&quot;, boldly going where no (obviously) female minifig has gone before!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-20T11:05:07Z","drip drip drip","The DFD is in my humble opinion one of the best of the larger space craft models Lego has come up with. It's big, yet has components which are compact but not gaudy or odd-looking when separated from the ship. The DFD is made up of four components which I will term as the following: two command pods, central/silo section, and aft cargo hold.
Each command pod is identical to the other, a one-man thruster vehicle with skis for landing gear and outside clips and hooks to hold the driver's skis and chain saw/laser. Figures fit comfortably in the pod and with minor alterations to minifig and vehicle, you can even fit two figs to a pod.
The central section is a very cool design in itself, using two sets of wings to give a top-view x-type formation. This section's entire centerpiece is a holding/launching unit for a large probe/rocket. The section's hinged canopy has a connecting pin at the base of the hinge for the rocket. As the roof is raised, the pin holds the rocket in place and raises it at the same time so that with the roof raised at a ninety-degree angle, the rocket stands ready for the launch. This central unit's nose is a curious five-pronged assembly which could also be a mini-satellite or a multi-phaser weapon system.
The aft cargo hold is a little more bulky looking, but is probably the sturdiest of all sections. It has a segmented canopy/door (like garage doors for town system models) which slides back to reveal its cargo area. This area also holds a small scout vehicle and is constructed so that as the garage door is rolled back, the scout ship (loaded on a rotating axle assembly) flips up and points into the sky for a quick launch.
There isn't a lot to the scout craft (though it could be used as a quick escape vehicle) so I prefer to use this large, approximately 8x8x5 area to hold large amounts of cargo or passengers. (Side note: center and aft sections use white top-mounted thruster elements for propulsion, but the ships also actually rest on these for landing which I'm not too crazy about but I'll get over it.)
As mentioned, each component functions well on its own, or a command pod can be inserted into the front of the center or aft section to create a different looking ship. My preference is to use all modules as one large craft.
The set contains three figs (two men and a woman) with standard Ice Planet equipment, but I would rather equip my crew without the back-mounted tanks because I can get more individuals into a vehicle that way. (This also applies to other Space and Aquanaut sets.) I guess you need to decide how badly your people need oxygen (fuss, fuss).
There are no particularly unique parts here, it's mainly standard space stuff: tubes, antennas, transparent panels (corner and side), but the segmented garage door is not common to space (and never comes in bright orange with town sets) and it was very nice to get three pairs of wing-flats for alternate sets.

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The Deep Freeze Defender pays homage to the classic Galaxy Commander from 1983 with its distinct dual cockpit design. The two identical cockpits are detachable as independent flyers and feature the trademark for this series skis. The middle section hides a rocket under a hatch, which by opening lifts up the missile into launching position. The aft section is also detachable and serves as a compartment for a small flyer, like an escape pod. The surprise here is that by sliding the rolling roof, its mechanism pushes the escape pod into launching position. Both the missile and the escape pod come with magnets to further enhance the playability of the set. The modularity of this set is amazing; each of the detachable cockpits can be combined with the middle and rear sections to form two large and veritable spaceships with single cockpit. All in all the playability of this set is fantastic; it is packed with features and innovative functions, maybe the most versatile spaceship that Lego ever made.</p>
<p>Unfortunately to fit so many functions takes a toll on the design of this spaceship. &nbsp;To simulate the streamlined feeling of a spaceship with Lego bricks is always a challenge and this is particularly evident on this design. Although the general scheme is rather interesting, this spaceship is not as beautiful as a 6980 - Galaxy Commander or a 6986 - Mission Commander. It features too many flat surfaces and the aft section is relatively blocky and its wings look relatively small. And as already mentioned above the colour scheme is really not my cup of tea.</p>

"keithyw","2008-12-10T13:47:45.293Z","My Personal Favorite &quot;Large&quot; Ship","Occasionally, the twin cockpit design has made shown up through the history of Lego.  The Galaxy Commander, the Aeriel Intruder, the recent Mars Mission MX-81 craft and this one.  But I think if Lego was attempting to perfect that particular model/design, this comes the closest in terms of setting standards.  

This set is extremely modular and incorporates the Ice Planet theme.  I think the whole modularity of this set makes it an incredible buy.  You can detach the front two sections, detach the two rear sections and formulate two new space ships.  What more can a kid want besides two more space ships in one set?

Well, it has more.  There's a little hidden rocket/probe inside the mid section, which also has a detachable probe on its tip.  The rear section also contains an old dude with his tiny rocket sled that raises once the garage-like section is opened up.  That's the most original usage of a garage that I've seen!

Also, the common Ice Planet elements of chainsaws and skis are including with this set.  But the detachable front cockpits have longer skis themselves, really emphasizing the skiing metaphor employed in this series!

In terms of flaws, there are a few but not too glaring ones.  The main flaw/complaint I have with this is that the so-called thrusters on this thing are either too small or non-existent.  For the size of this craft, it's hard to explain what exactly propels it around.  Another flaw is just purpose.  Like the mid and rear sections of the craft.  Now, they house elements that can blast off, but it makes you wonder what the point is in some way.  Why would a ship be needed to launch a rocket?  And why is there a tiny sled ship in the rear?  The rear end especially is large and seems to waste a bit of space with the corridor-like elements bulging outward.  It seems as though that section could use a few computers to make it appear more base-like.

However, those complaints aside, I think the set is very tight.  It's stable and the only the skis themselves have a tendency to fall off (which is more of a problem with how the skis are designed than the set itself).  I remember setting my eyes on this set one Christmas at TRU and immediately snatched it up, even though other Ice Planet sets started to appear.

<p>This mammoth Cruiser is a four-section vehicle, two command modules/ski-speeders, a central rocket-launching module and a large hangar module. The two command modules could fit on each of the larger sections to make two smaller independent craft.</p>

<p>The two command modules/ski-speeders looked great with matching upper and lower contours, the sloped cockpit and canopy bricks made a perfect combination and provided a spacious cockpit for the pilots. The cockpit contained a standard Ice Planet printed computer sloped brick topped off by two vent bricks (electronics cooling/oxygen supply?). The module was fully equipped for land operations as high-speed ski vehicles. The underside had four studs and two skis for carpet running, the skis tending to be a bit fragile but easily re-attached and allowing for some interesting landing damage. Each craft comes with two rocket/jet engines and hooks for the pilot&#39;s skis, icesaw and a hand-held torch/ray tool. The craft attach securely to either of the larger sections securely without wobbling in-flight. The action is crisp and there is no danger of damage when pulling the cockpits off from the main sections.</p>

<p>The rocket-launcher module has one major neat feature, the roof holds the small rocket which when opened tilts the rocket into the vertical firing position. When flying the rocket is securely held. The front of the roof is a cool looking printed blue windscreen brick with the Ice Planet logo and was unique to just this set. The roof is easy to open but won&#39;t swing open unintentionally even if the craft is flown upside down.&nbsp;On each side of the roof is a tailfin brick with a vent brick at the top. The external stowage of the satellite seemed a bit vulnerable and cheap, but I guess other than making the rocket section even longer there was no alternative.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outside, the module has two large wings, one sloped inwards and one conventional backwards swept wing, the former holding two large circular radio/radar antenna (always reminded me of a mini-AWACS type radar aircraft) and the other wing had two flat Ice Planet printed bricks and two vent bricks for decoration. The overall effect of the wings looked great. The bottom of this section had no less than six rocket engine pods attached which also doubled as ideal resting points when landed on the carpet/sofa/bed. It can be landed and used as a ground-based launching facility easily enough as its perfectly stable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hangar section is a large module with two wings. The main body is a large hangar with some several neon-orange window sections and a roller garage door roof section which opens. The front of the module cleverly has both pin and hole bricks to allow the module to securely attach the centre module (with the aid of two hinging arms to add further support) and allow on of&nbsp;the smaller command module to attach to it. The wings feature radio antenna at the tips (these parts are always fragile), thruster rockets with flexible pipes leading to two rear nozzles and two further sloped printed bricks with the Ice Planet logo, just in case you weren&#39;t sure this is an Ice Planet expedition. On the bottom are no less than six more rocket pods, plus two more doubling as handles for the clever hangar door locking mechanism. The two tailfins also feature thruster rockets.&nbsp;The main feature of the hangar is the clever tilting launch mechanism for the smaller craft inside. However, I always found this quite stiff due to the use of the technic plugs and always feared the flimsy garage door elements would break or pop off the runners. Also, getting the craft onto the launching mechanism wasn&#39;t always easy. Some kind of computer terminal inside would have been good, I always thought the space was slightly wasted and that a small command post would have been better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The small craft is a pretty neat design incorporating a magnet on the port side and hooks for skis and controlled by a computer panel and a stalk antenna. The only odd feature is the lack of any kind of engine.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with three minifigures. The Ice Planet Chief (Commander Bear) with different torso and printed head with bushy eyebrows and mustache, a standard Ice Planet figure with printed male head with white hair and a standard Ice Planet figure with a printed female head with red hair, earrings and lipstick. This was probably the first specifically female Space figure and a welcome addition, it was a pity she was only offered in two sets. Peeron indicates the head was only used in two Ice Planet sets but I&#39;m sure the head was a re-used pirate female head. Each figure has a pair of skis and plenty of hand-held tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This was among my most favourite sets and in my view represents the pinnacle of the 1990s Space sets. It was big but cool looking design and was almost perfect, the few minor nitpicks I&#39;ve raised above are not serious enough to detract from the enjoyment of this set. The Ice Planet theme integrated land and space adventures in a way the other sub-themes didn&#39;t do as well, in this set both are combined nicely and the rocket can be used with set 6898 Vx162. I think its a pity the Ice Planet sets didn&#39;t make more use of magnets. I often wondered if this was the Zycon&nbsp;IV, what the Zycon&nbsp;III etc. looked like, when you break this set down you have everything you need and more to make your own creations to imagine what the rest of the Zycon cruisers might have looked like.&nbsp;</p>

"Faefrost","2014-07-28T05:00:43.133Z","Easy contender for Best Lego Spaceship","<p>Wow! As an AFOl I recently added this set to my collection used via Bricklink. Wow! A good case can be made that this is easily one of the best Lego Spaceships ever made. The only other sets that can touch it are the venerable LL&nbsp;928, the classic Blacktron Renegade, and the latest and greatest Benny&#39;s spaceship Spaceship SPACESHIP or LL 929 if you prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the build and construction. It&#39;s astonishingly solid. I had to do a double take several times when looking up the date of this set. This is one of the most solidly build utterly swooshable sets Lego has ever come up with. It is stable. Rock solid. (With the exception of the cockpit skis a minor nuisance). Every major structure is solidly connected and reinforced. The Explorians Starship this is NOT. Heck it passes the &quot;shake it&quot; test. This thing is not coming apart until you want it to.</p>

<p>The design itself is striking. It is a somewhat classic 2 cockpit Y shape that Lego has done several times. Most notably in the Classic Space Galaxy Commander and the Mars Mission Hypersonic Operations Aircraft. The DFD is the one they got 100% right. It looks and feels like a complete ship. No or few glaring holes. No skeletal undersides. No vast open spaces. It is a sleek enclosed ship from head to tail. The few gaps are more styling at the rear to break up the trans clear orange a little. You can see how good it looks from the top in the picture. For once the underside looks and feels just as complete.</p>

<p>The colors are amazing. They just pop on the shelf. The trans neon orange adds a splash that I was not expecting. The alternating trans orange and white of the horizontal&nbsp;sliding roll up hanger door is truly striking. The blue and white both give it a classic space look and feel while bringing it forward in an unexpected way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In spite of how solid and enclosed it is the ship is extremely modular in ways representing the best of Classic Space. The ship separates into 4 sections. The two individual cockpits, the X shaped mid section / rocket launch bay. And the rear square cargo / hanger bay. The cockpits can dock directly to the rear pod. The front and mid sections make a nice ship to themselves, and the rear can be used as a landed base.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play features are pretty compelling. Aside from the obvious multi ship swooshability, the X shaped mid section opens up to reveal a Ballistic Missile Satellite&nbsp;Launcher. The top striped section of the rear module is a sliding garage type door. When it opens it triggers a mechanism that lifts a little flyer into launch position. Both the rocket and the flyer have magnets, so you can send the flyer out to retrieve the rocket following a launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are great. 3 classic Ice Planet figs. Including the Ice Planet Chief and Lego&#39;s first ever female astronaut. So amazingly this set not only had 3 space figs. It had 3 distinctly different space figs. Well done Lego 1993!</p>

<p>Cons - What few complaints I have are exceedingly minor. Each cockpit has a pair of long white shkis underneath as landing skids. They give the separated cockpits a kind of Star Trek &quot;speedboat&quot; shuttlecraft&nbsp;kind of look. Which is cool. But they are very light, long, hook shaped and only tacked on with their two studs. So they get knocked off a lot. The only parts on the set that do that. the set is surprising clean. It lacks the forests of protruding antennae and &quot;absolutely positively not wink&nbsp;wink laser guns&quot;&nbsp;that so populate so many other sets. (Like the Galaxy Commander and Hypersonic Operations Craft.)</p>

<p>My only other minor complaint is the lack of any real interior. Each pilot has their place. But there is no internal lab or launch control etc. The entire back is taken up by the hanger launch lift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall - A truly grat set. One of the best that Lego ever produced. One that you will fall in love with the moment you get it into your hands. I was not expecting to love this set so much. I saw an affordable one and grabbed it on a whim. But damn! It is gorgeous. It stands up favorably to modern set designs 20 years later.</p>

"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-12-15T13:55:25.13Z","‘Classic’ Spaceship comparison reviews.","<p>The <em>6973-Deep Freeze Defender</em> from the 1993 Ice Planet 2002 subtheme is the third of the large classic spaceships I own. With 417 pieces it&rsquo;s slightly smaller than <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49541""><em>6986-Mission Commander</em></a> &nbsp;from the 1989 Space Police subtheme, and less than half the number of pieces than <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49540""><em>70816-Benny&rsquo;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!</em></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is 20 pages, 3 of which are cover pages with various pictures of the set, which leaves 17 pages for the 2 cockpit pods, the middle launcher section, and the rear garage and mini flyer. Averaging 25 pieces per page, the build proceeds at a quick pace, and is pretty easy to follow, even without part lists for each step.</p>

<p>The colour scheme is White, Bright Blue and Transparent Neon Orange (not sure what colour that would be officially these days). It contrasts nicely with the Black and Blue of the Space Police, and certainly looks the part for an Ice Planet theme. There are no bad guys in this set (or I think this whole theme), more along the lines of the classic exploration theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 2 detachable front cockpits on skis, with minifig skis and tools attached to the outside. The middle section opens to reveal a missile/rocket on which a mini satellite can be launched. The rocket also has a magnet so it can be retrieved and transported by the mini flyer in the rear garage. The garage features a clever opening mechanism, unlock the back &#39;garage door&#39;, and sliding it back raises the mini flyer into a launch position. The mini flyer also has minifig skis for the pilot and a magnet to retrieve and transport the missile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set (and theme) also features some of the first minifigs with face printing (I think Space Police II just beat Ice Planet 2002 to this the previous year). We get a &#39;Chief&#39; with white moustache and eyebrows, &#39;Blond Guy&#39;, and &#39;Ice Planet Babe&#39; with red hair and lips!</p>

<p>This spaceship seems a little more complete than 6986, with no real empty space. It&#39;s not quite as solid as that ship, mainly due to the multiple detachable sections, but it&#39;s still very swooshable, with plenty of playability with the multiple sections and vehicles.</p>
