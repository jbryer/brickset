"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-22T11:40:58Z","Alien Avenger","     All in all, this set is great if you're a space LEGO collector. It's got all the best mini-figures from the space UFO collection, and with all those pieces you can make just about anything from it. On the down side though, it's kind of on the pricy side (last time I checked) and NOT very portable. Plus those UFO guys are so cool with their freaky helmets and that body armor. I give it a 8 out of 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It comes with a lot of rare pieces like magnets, boxes, the aliens themselves, and many more.  This set is so cool and by far exceeds all other UFO sets.  The aliens are my favorite part of the set.  There freaky masks are the greatest.  Personally I like the black masked alien the most.  His face is so cool.

Main reason why I don't give this a '5' is because those colorful designs are printed on those big grey bricks. Hard to use them for something else, say non-alien, when you have those designs staring back at you. Also, the cannons aren't that cool to me.
Still this is a very unique and original set. Perfect for invading any Lego Town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Awesome pieces.

Colour changing bricks (they change with heat)
Magnets
Extra features
Great minifigures",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-15T19:12:20.59Z","Best UFO set!","This set has it all--an awesome design, tons of cool features, detailed mini-figs, and even a cool name. There's so much in this set I couldn't possibly write about it all without taking up 40 pages.

As size goes, it's pretty big. The top half, which can detach from the bottom, is the same size of the other UFO in the series, the Cyber Saucer. It looks pretty magnificant wherever you put it.

But a great UFO wouldn't be complete without lots of features, and this one does. Like I mentioned earlier, the top detaches from the bottom, and it does so via 4 magnets. This system works quite good, though there is a little gap. 

There are also 2 vehicles, which can be stored in the UFO. The bigger car has a magnet on it, and can be picked up with a big arm, and be placed in the UFO. The smaller is really plain, but it is still cool.

The figures--all 4 of them, are very well made. They look great, full of detailed design. The helmets are very cool, though you can't see their faces at all under them. Though that may be good, since their faces are pretty ugly...but still cool.

There is much more to talk about, but that sums up the basics. Buy this set for sure if you can find it at a good price! :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Commander_Jaller","2009-11-09T16:20:57.403Z","An incredible saucer!","This is my biggest UFO set so far, and it is AWESOME!
Includes four minifigures:
Alpha Draconis, the leader of the aliens that were in the UFO line, other than him there also is a red colored alien, a blue colored alien and last but not least, the blue droid.

The saucer itself has many awesome details, including panels, antennae, magnet pieces, and a bunch more! It also has a cool name, the ""Alien Avenger"".
Let's get on with the pro's and con's of this beast...

PRO'S:
- Alpha Draconis minifig
- The top can be detached and easily put back again with the use of magnets
- Some round plates change color with heat
- One small wheeled vehicle that can be hidden in the saucer
- One bigger wheel-vehicle (car?), which can be hidden inside too
- Magnetic crane that pulls up anything else magnetic
- One main cockpit, and two cockpit-like things on the sides (one on each)
- Laser things on the front
- EVERY single minifig can be put inside!
- Two extra panels not used on the set

CON'S:
- NONE!

OVERALL:
This is a great set and highly recommended to any space fan!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-21T08:08:13.8Z","LEGO Space (U.F.O.) - Alien Avenger Review","This is one of my favourite LEGO Space (U.F.O.) sets. It has some nice weapons and a cool look. I like the way how LEGO designed the turrets on the front. On the back we get some small engines which look really nice, too. This saucer comes with an arm which has a magnet and the other side has a trunk which you can open to get the rover out. The cockpit on the front and on the back can be opened but there's nothing much in it. The coolest thing about this set is that you get a smaller saucer which you can attach to the magnets on the bigger one. After you've taken it off you can see a bigger rover in there which has a magnet as well but no controls. In the inside you can also see two boxes where you can hide something. It's an awsome set and it's very sturdy as well. There're also no stickers which you have to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-21T00:38:58.983Z","Jewel Of The Krell","<h2><strong>*GOLD BRICK SET*</strong></h2>

<p>If you ever wanted a classic sci-fi&nbsp;craft in the Space theme then this set provided it. Invasion and abduction and mystery was all possible thanks to the Alien Avenger.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>Stunning mini aliens here, the little range included&nbsp;is diverse for the UFO alien race with one of everyone except the red android who can be added easily. The prints are beautiful with the helmets adding a different characterisation&nbsp;from the very alien faces underneath. Mind&nbsp;you, all the faces differ so perhaps they can be the same race or not as you choose. The shoulder and chest armour&nbsp;concept introduced here was used over a decade later on aliens and space characters and still works brilliantly. Gold circuitry, trans colour heads and very high detailing. Give the designer a medal.</p>

<p><strong>Like A Record Baby </strong><br />
Once&nbsp;you&#39;ve finished drooling over the MFs you can get building the mini saucer. That&#39;s right there&#39;s a top to the saucer that magnetises on fantastically and is in itself the commander&#39;s break away pod-saucer. The trans bright lime green dome follows much of this excellent colour&nbsp;in Space on transmitters and the mini saucer, like the rest of the ship is resplendent in amazing alien prints on beautiful curved sections of fuselage and with holographic stickered&nbsp;receivers/ scanners and holo-tiles. Some universal symbols feature and the grey chair is a subtle&nbsp;offset contrast for an&nbsp;interior.</p>

<p>A hefty buggy is provided as a transport again with the superb Lego magnets that mean the buggy can get loaded on by the robotic arm of the ship. It is blue, grey and&nbsp;functional and this, in the end seems suitable for the design and how it fits on board which is pretty clever.</p>

<p>The main build is strong and includes more brilliant parts and prints. The trap door grate piece and a variety of brick types and colours making an imaginative and unique enclosed space. It is highly suitable for play and abducting scared people who can stare through the grate in hope of rescue! The gaps in the huge quarter round dome sections make for two bright cockpits for the characters to lie down in, a rotating mount for the robotic arm and a release hatch for the rover. That&#39;s right another buggy, tiny as a recon vehicle but can be ridden by a character. This hatch is a really welcome feature with another badge and handle atop. The underneath of the craft has many burners and eight directional boosters with a central rotating cylinder with lights that can be hand held so your saucer can spin through the air as you fly it. The cannons back on top of the mothership are on turntables also to lend yet more action with searchlights, speakers and various technology features. Two alien postboxes with erm, alien letters? are included on the build. Those holo-tiles&nbsp;are indeed heat sensitive revealing an alien face when pressed long enough.</p>

<p><strong>Ceiling Display Saucer</strong><br />
Alternative builds are shown on the box, even one where the android gets a hat. Its not regularly that I find myself wanting only the main model. A flying saucer is&nbsp;so defined and here, so well executed that I find this hard to match and it raises the bar for high quality toy designing. The play features are varied and excellent and this set is a credit to an old theme when I found so many later sets were poor in their definition regarding space and sci-fi. The crew and model with its transports and a little spare space makes a comprehensive set for all collectors who appreciate a decent UFO flying saucer.&nbsp;I could mention small vehicle flaws but they are fine as secondary loaded gear working with the main spacecraft which is&nbsp;beautiful, much fun to build and ultimately a wonderful children&#39;s construction toy. Simply brilliant.</p>

"LegoMunchy88","2011-09-07T17:12:23.85Z","""Take Me to Your Leader""","<p>Lego Alien Avenger is my third-favorite LEGO set of all time, only beaten, in my opinion, by 6093 Flying Ninja Fortress and 5988 Pharaoh's Forbidden. I don't have Pharaoh's Forbidden Ruins, but you can read my Flying Ninja Fortress review <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=40315"">here</a>. Anyway, onto the review. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p><p>Alpha Dragonis: The commander of the UFO aliens and the best figure in the set, he looks just awesome. The black helmet looks really good, but my only issue with him is that his face looks like he has buckteeth. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Red Alien: Also a very good figure, and the red makes him look much more like an alien than the black on Alpha Dragonis. Once again, the only problem I have with him is his face, which looks like he's got a perma-smile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue Alien: I think the Blue Alien looks most like an alien, and the blue looks very nice. I actually think that the face looks good on this one, much more like an alien. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue Android: I can't see that this is a bad figure, it's just that he's not that great compared to the aliens. Although, when the only UFO set I had was Radon Rover, I thought he was pretty cool. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p>The set is mainly made up of the base of the ship, a detachable vehicle, and two ground vehicles. First, the vehicles. The smallest vehicle is only a 4x4 plate with some tires, a control panel, and a space for the android. It's not that great, but it fits well into a compartment in the set. The second and larger vehicle is really nice. Driven by the Blue Alien, it have a nice design, and one of those heat-sensitive pieces that are unique to the UFO seriese. There is also a magnet, which allows the vehicle to be picked up by the crane and place inside the ship. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the spaceship. The spaceship is built pretty well on the bottom, and has a handle that allows it to be held, although the handle feels very unstable to me. The next part of the ship is the curved pieces that created the UFO effect. Between the pieces on the four sides are a crane, the compartment for the buggy, and two compartments that fit the Red Alien and the Blue Android. There are also two thrusters on the back, and two very large cannons on the front. I find the cannons a bit excessive, but they're nice. Inside the ship is the control room and the space for the vehicle. The area looks very nice once the vehicle is taken out. Inside the control room is the controls for the crane, some compratents, and the magnets that allow the other part to attach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the top of the set. The top is Alpha Dragonis's starfighter, and it can attach to the avenge when it is flying, and then detach to give access to the base. The vehicle is very nice, with some nice curved pieces, some shiny stickers, and another heat-sensitive piece. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p><p>Overall, LEGO 6975 Alien Avenger is a great set, and I got it for a great price. It has some great figs, and a very unique design that is so much better than the new Alien Conquest sets. Don't waste money on those, buy the originals. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks, </p><p>LegoMunchy88</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Faefrost","2014-09-14T22:21:21.73Z","Solid and Fun UFO set","<p>While the Interstellar Starfighter was a bust, this one is quite charming, A somewhat classic old school flying saucer. An idea that Lego would revisit in the Alien Conquest line.</p>

<p>of the pros and cons with this one? Well under Pro&#39;s it is without doubt the best of the UFO line (Not a particularly high hurdle to jump). It is a coherrant design that plays well into the theme and offers a lot to do. The top section is an independent ship help in place by Mtron type magnets. The bottom is a nice mix of mothership and mobile base. while there are some odd flourishes on the ship (seriously why use the triangle clip pieces and holograms? They look grossly out of place. Like they were just churning through excess parts to amp up the &quot;cool&quot; factor on the marketing departments checklist. )</p>

<p>The robot arm is kind of neat although would seem exceeding fragile and kind of breaks up the exterior flow of the ship awkwardly. It would have been great if it folded up into the cavity below the top saucer. The little rover that the arm lifts out is a nice sleek design. Very stiking looking. It inly suffers mildly for having very little ground Clarence so not rolling well on rough surfaces.</p>

<p>The 4 minifigs&nbsp;are the standard UFO fare. 2 UFO dudes, one UFO leader and a robot. While each is distinct in colors paterns and markings they still manage to not stand out well from each other. On the plus side all three aliens have the printed helmets, which are truly cool, and each has armor. 2 black and 1 grey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the set is really just 8 quarter dishes that sit like a salad plate stacked atop a dinner plate. Lot&#39;s of neat trans neon green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want something from the UFO line, this is probably the best option. It lacks the Interstellar Starfighters&nbsp;gimicks like fiber optic lights that do nothing, and feels substantially different from all other Lego Space Ships. Far from a great Ship, but an acceptably good one.</p>

This UFO set is average at best, like the Interstellar Starfighter. It has a nice traditional sci-fi saucer shape, but the design is pretty tacky. <br><br>Like many LEGO spacecraft, the interior is seriously lacking in substance and detail, with basically nothing except 2 storage boxes, a few gimmicky heat stickers and an empty spot for the rover to sit. If you like the exterior design, go for it, but otherwise collectors should give it a miss.<br>",TRUE,2,4,2,3,3
