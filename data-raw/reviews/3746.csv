The not-so-good: There are too many big pieces, making alternative building difficult.  The design is flimsy.  Building the set was a nightmare.  I put one piece in place only for several others to suddenly 'pop' out of place, or become disconnected.  The fibre optic device was a stupid gimmick which just put the price up.  Mine, despite being brand new, failed to work anyway.

Summary: A nice-looking set.  Has its faults, but in its defence it's certainly nowhere near as over-specialised as the sets of today.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-20T23:35:59.273Z","Interstellar Invaders 150th Review","<p>Set #6979 Interstellar Starfighter: My last review for today/tonight will be my 150th Review on Brickset, and how fitting that it be for a ship that I truly enjoyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Interstellar Starfighter was the largest Space Themed set that my brother or I ever recieived (it originally belonged to my brother, then it came to me, now it is still at my cousins house I think.) and it is also conveniently the only light and sound brick using set that we ever owned as well. It was massive, at almost 300 pieces, a lot of them unique from the UFO Sub-Theme the ship took up quite a bit of room. (Hence why I let it go during the Great LEGO Purge.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building this ship was fantastic, it took a good length of time and when it was finished you had a ship that could take your UFO Mini-Figures on invasions of other Space realms, such as Blacktron territory or the treacherous Insectoid Hive System. If there is one flaw with this vessel though it is the fact that some of the pieces refused to stay locked down due to the weight of the large saucer pieces, and the landing gear was easily lost/fell off while you were playing with it. I'd have to say it is much better as a display piece than anything to actually play with it, even though it does have some impressive gimmicks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all there is the light &amp; sound brick, which takes a 9V battery and lights up the clear tubes which attach to the rear of the ship from the central section, where the battery holding brick is installed. There were a couple of transparent holding containers for alien pieces... I have no clue what they were meant for, but it was just something to do with the Mini-Figures, have them gather up the small&nbsp;rectangular plate with the printed alien tech and slide it into the container... Almost like mailing alien mail. The best and last gimmick was the ability to detach the rear saucer section (mounted on by magnetic pieces.) and use it to zoom around the room with your UFO Mini-Figure. If not for that one feature this ship would lose a point on the playability scale because it is rather cumbersome to hold in your hands, even for an adult, hence why I said it's more of a Display Set as opposed to Play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UFO Mini-Figures were some of the best of the bunch. I really liked the helmets and shoulder armor that the higher up commanders wore. And if I was an unscrupulous cad I would have kept them when I gave my cousin the ship, but I knew she'd be dissapointed and it was wrong, so I let them go on to their new owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this set is almost perfect, if not for the cumbersome awkward nature of the set and the weight issues while playing with it I'd recommend it to any Space Theme loving child, as it stands I'd say that if your child prefers to display their LEGO on a shelf then this set would be a good buy, otherwise you might prefer a more streamlined Space vehicle for play times and leave this one for the older children in the house. (If they happen to still like LEGO that is.) True it scores high, fives all around, but I think the Warp Wing Fighter is a better UFO based Set for people who like playing with their ships and not having to hold it up with both hands as opposed to dogfighting between two vessels.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"BigMac","2010-12-28T23:15:46.953Z","It is a great set with many special parts at the present price.","First of all, space and UFO themes are not my favourite. I bought the set, three months ago, just because of the optic fibre, the flash lights, the micro motor and the battery box. I won the complete set in almost new condition on ebay for just USD 32.5. Usually this set can be bought at about $35 - $40. The original price tag of $80.0 was too much.<div><br></div><div>After I finished, I do not want to take it down and is still being displayed on my shelf. From time to time, I would turn off the desk lamp and press the button of this UFO to watch the fancy optic fibre, the flash light and listen to the humming noise of the micro motor. It is beautiful, wonderful and gives the great feeling of mystery in the space.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros</div><div><br></div><div>1. Mini Figs:&nbsp;I am in my fifties now, I do not have much interest in mini figs, I still love the mini figs of the set as they were design in great details, like the helmet shoulder armour and the body printings. They are really complying to the theme of UFO.</div><div>2. The lights: the optic fibre and the flashing light in the control cabin enhances the beauty of the set to almost perfect.</div><div>3. The detachable saucer shuttle is very cute, which can be easily detached or attached &nbsp;by magnets to the mother ship, a very clever design.</div><div>4. The use of transparent cockpit is also very smart, as you can see the flashing lights and all the beautiful mini figs inside without open them.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons.</div><div><br></div><div>1. To some people, the noise of the micro motor is annoying, other than this I cannot think of any.</div><div><br></div><div>Modification</div><div><br></div><div>Because of this one, I bought the warp wing fighter 6915, it is very easy to combine these two sets. Remove all the black stands for 6915, and remove the detached saucer shuttle of 6979. Place 6915 on top of 6979. A much bigger model is done. It looks very pretty especially from the back. In the case you want to make it even bigger, add the saucer shuttle back to the top of 6915, it needs a little bit of modification work, but not difficult at all. It is now a three level giant UFO. You will love this.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading.</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"richselby","2011-06-25T19:14:11.58Z","Everything you'd want in a Spaceship","<div>I never really understood why the UFO sets had a bad rep amongst AFOLs. &nbsp;&nbsp;UFO sets never seem to cost a lot on the secondary market, even the large ones. So I purchased this one on ebay for a very reasonable price and gave it a whirl.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>A big ship should take a while to build, and indeed it does.&nbsp;It took my 6 year old son and I a couple of hours to put together.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A big should should be, well, &nbsp;big, and indeed it is, occupying a satisfyingly large chunk of table space when done.</div><div><br></div><div>There were parts in the build I've never seen before, e.g. funky magnet connectors which allow the back section to be easily detached. This worked very well in practice, allowing my son to break and reattach the rear easily in play.</div><div><br></div><div>It lights up! It comes with 8 fibre optic cables and a battery box. When you press the button, it puts on quite a light display. Each of the eight cables light up in sequence, and there's a firey glow emanating from the trans green cockpit. Think re-purpose as Christmas MOC, come December.</div><div><br></div><div>The large dome sections might not have any obvious re-use value outside of a flying saucer, but by golly, they look terrific in one.</div><div><br></div><div>If there was one teensy thing I would moan about, &nbsp;it's the noise the engine makes when you press the button. Space ships should swoosh or roar. This whines.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So there you have it. What's not to like? I loved it.&nbsp;It was a lot more fun than some of the overpriced Star Wars sets. And it looked even better with a couple of Empire baddie minifigs inside (my son's idea). &nbsp;So don't let the poor reputation of UFO sets put you off. Snap them up before everyone else decides they're actually quite cool after all.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-17T14:41:44.26Z","A stellar spaceship.","<p>For obvious reasons, the UFO subtheme of Space pioneered the use of large, quarter-circle pieces to give an imposing sense of curvature to all of the larger starships in its line. The two flagship, er, ships of the UFO line are this one and Alien Avenger (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6975-1"">6975</a>), and, years&nbsp;later,&nbsp;I was actually mildly surprised to learn that Interstellar Starfighter is, piececount-wise, the smaller of the two sets in spite of being more expensive. Naturally, this is due in large part to the ""fiber optic"" gimmick that will be discussed shortly, but it must be said that, unfortunately, I am not able to compare this set to Alien Avenger because I was never able to get it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clocking in at just under 300 pieces, it's actually kind of surprising how large Interstellar Starfighter is. A lot of this is plain deception, of course: the large quarter-circle pieces add a lot of bulk to a frame that is essentially four studs wide along the main, its skinniness becoming readily apparent when one removes the battery box. The end of the ship consists of a complicated set of boosters, missiles,&nbsp;and an escape vehicle of sorts whose size is also inflated due to the use of a pair of quarter-circle pieces at the back as well. The effect of this lopsidedness is that the ship ends up having a sort of vulnerable feel to it, in which a potential aggressor might fire at the battery box and thereby rend the ship in two, but fortunately this is much more of an illusion than an actuality. While there are fiddly bits - such as the ""landing legs"" - that are liable to fall off in transit, it's doubtful that you'll ever find this ship breaking in half on accident. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Central to the Starfighter is, as previously mentioned, is a light-and-sound feature that helps you make alien invasion noises as the ship strafes beleagured City Minifigs. Sadly, the light-and-sound components of my set no longer work, and I don't remember what their shelf life was exactly (though I suspect that someone with a rudimentary knowledge of electrical engineering would be able to fix it in a jiffy). The pulsating red fiber optic veins may seem like a little bit of a gimmick to grown-ups, but as a kid, they were pretty cool, I have to say. I don't know if this specific&nbsp;feature was ever implemented in any other sets, but the effect worked extremely well with the UFO aesthetic, and it is a shame to me that mine doesn't work any more. Getting to the battery box, though, was a colossal pain,&nbsp;so much so that it was one thing that I dreaded before purchasing any of the modern train sets; this design flaw&nbsp;has fortunately been corrected since then (at least as far as trains are concerned, anyway). &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A true highlight of this set - and of the UFO line in general - is the Minifigs. Those pathetic Chitauri menacing Captain America (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6865-1"">6865</a>) don't hold a candle to the UFO aliens. The generic red alien goon is all well and good, but it's the two elite commanders that you get with this set that&nbsp;make this set shine. I'm not sure why the UFO theme flirted with blue aliens for some of the sets, but I will say that I find the black/dark grey and the red/light grey combinations to be the superior&nbsp;colour choice&nbsp;here. They have sweet helmets, sweet armour, and, best of all, <em>trans-orange heads</em>. Beat that if you can.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's not the nicest looking spaceship in the world, but I think Interstellar Starfighter succeeds in pulling off a distinctly ""foreign"" look that one would expect from a non-human race of alien invaders. It's a toss-up between this set and Alien Avenger to act as mothership for the UFO subtheme, though, to me, this set is more than capable of holding its own. UFO is awesome. </p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,2
"Faefrost","2014-09-14T05:28:28.327Z","A rather strange bird","<p>i&#39;ve recently added the UFO Theme 6979 Interstellar Starfighter to my increasing collection of Lego Space Capital Ships, and I gotta say this one is far from the best of the lot. While distinct it is at best a strange beast that seems to be serving many design masters and ultimately feels more than a bit disjointed. Like somebody simply asked an 8 yeold&nbsp;&quot;what would make a cool spaceship&quot; and then just built the random explosion that came out of their mouth, bypassing that whole messy design refinement and aesthetics stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is one of the larger Lego Space main ships, with an overall length that is approaching but not quite passing the Explorian&#39;s Starship and Benny&#39;s ssS. The main ship itself is designed and built in three sections, which give the distinct impression of having been designed by three different people, working in unrelated departments, who only brought them together late on a Friday after happy hour at the local Pub.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front section is the main command saucer. It holds to the general aesthetic and features of the other main UFO sets. Large Light Grey Saucer pieces with overly elaborate printing, including some interesting metalics. Sadly the printing has that very fine line overly scribbly feel that so plagued the UFO and Insectoid lines. So much of it that the saucers are pretty much useless for MOC&#39;ing. The actual shape of the saucer section is interesting and well achieved combing 2 large saucers at the front with two smaller radius ones at the rear giving a broad rarrowhead shape. It&#39;s topped off with a roomy 2 seat cockpit and canopies in Trans Neon Light Green. (Same colors as MTron). The rear of the command pod connects to the neck. And the connection point like the neck itself is a mishmash of plates wings, battery boxes and electronics. Facing forward from the neck is a 9V light module that illuminate the cocpit&nbsp;when a button is pressed. Red light under lime green cannopies...Yeah its bleah! But proceeding rearward the electronic abominations are not done. The spine contains a 9V Micro Motor spinng&nbsp;aFiber&nbsp;Optic controller from which 8 kinked and twisty fibres&nbsp;hooked in. When the button is pressed&nbsp;they light uo 1 at a time in rotation to the loud&nbsp;growling noise of the motor.&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole neck took me 3 days to get right. Including 2 additional Bricklink orders. The Fibre&nbsp;and micromotor parts are small and fragile and often have not aged well in used sets. If you lose or break one they are godawful expensive to replace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the rear&nbsp;of the neck we reach the engine pod with detachable fighter. It&#39;s just a jumbled mess of specialty wing pieces that barely stay together topped&nbsp;off by a small fighter built into a half circle saucer piece. It attaches to the main ship via magnets, where it shakes rattles and rolls.</p>

<p>When it is all brought together it is... more or less all together. The ship has three minifigs. One UFO dude, One UFO Leader Aloha Draconis and One UFO Android. None are unique to this set. The aliens helmets are distinctive. I think they share chest armor with the Insectoids.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a set well appointed with gimmicks but far lacking on playfeatures.&nbsp;</p>
