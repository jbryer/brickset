"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-11T05:58:35Z","One of the best ever Lego spaceships","I wish I had had one of these when I was younger...This set has great figures and the back of the spaceship has a nice laboratory section in it with transparent blue 1x4 bricks! Excellent! All the parts in this set are flawless, with no mega-juniorised pieces or distasteful colours, and the colour scheme in great, and a change from the earlier classic space sets. 

I should also mention the box for this set features other great designs that can be made from the versatile bricks in this spaceship! If they rereleased this set tomorrow, I'd buy another 2 immediately! 

I've now bought my 3rd one of these! I sold a MISB one a while ago, but managed to find 2 cheap boxed ones at ebay totalling half the price!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-28T07:27:26Z","STRANGE BUT COOL","I bought this one by 1989, many years after the end of the fabrication of this set.The design is a bit strange, not as classical as the 928, and less beautiful than the 6929.
But this spaceship got lot of features and good pieces !!!
The 2 little rover are very cool too.It's a large spaceship which is a truly classic !!!
This set, in my opinion, has got two follow-up: 6973 and 6982. The 6973 is great, I own it too.But I don't like two much the 6982 (That I haven't)

A bit heavy at the back but the mobile lab thing that comes out is pretty cool. Sort of looks like a big version of 6890, but it doesn't quite work for me withit having that much white.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-06T16:10:54Z","Great ship but . . .","This ship was a wonderful creation. It was the first big ship in classic space to split up into different sections. The design and the colours were great but some of the pieces (mostly the white appendages at the front and the antenne on the ends of the wings) were either very fragile or caused bits to bend and break after a time. I had to periodically get a lot of spare bits when assembling this model. Great all the same!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-07-27T09:43:43Z","Classic Command Flagship 2.0","When this ship came out in 1983, I was totally amazed by its cool features that were, in my opinion, way ahead of its time! The two-seater pilot section is detachable as a sleek and formidable-looking flyer. The mobile lab concept is fun. One would imagine this ship dropping the lab on a planetoid, and the red spaceman hidden in the lab doing his exploration work by driving the lab around until it gets picked up by the mother ship again. Oh, yes, it does come with &quot;airtight&quot; cockpits and lab too -- a concept that got dropped by the mid-1980s. One drawback is unlike its predecessor 928, it cannot bring along its buggies. This excellent ship was replaced by a more boring 6985 in 1986.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

So much to ofeer and the coolness factor make this a must own set for the classic space series.  I love the split section and the size of the lab in the back.  Full credit to the designers of this set, you truly set the standard.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"robuko","2008-04-17T08:26:37.45Z","Sweet flagship","My favourite space set.  Fantastic design, good shape, good colours, good moving parts, swooshable, good parts for alternate models, lots of transparencies, no bad parts.

The ship splits into 3 pieces.  The twin cockpit ship extends back to the white tail wing.  It has trans blue cockpit pieces above and below the pilots so they can see, and is a very cool ship on its own.  2 steering wheels but no computers so the pilots do it the old way. Not sure how they would manage interstellar flight like this, or turn all those lights on. 

The white box on the back is a mobile lab with a hinged roof and satellite dish.  There is one guy and a couple of computers inside. 

The way the lab fits in to the blue winged cradle is sheer genius.  As the rear doors close, the lab gets lifted off the ground so that the ship can take off.  Awesome.  The link in to the white front ship is pretty robust, with a bunch of flat plates sliding together and locking in position.

The 2 buggies seem a bit of an afterthought.  One features a cable for refuelling but it isn't big enough to carry fuel, the other is just for getting around in.

There are 5 minifigs - 2 yellow pilots, a red computer guy and 2 white buggy drivers.

The set comes with a landing pad baseplate and landing lights.

This is a fantastic classic space set.  If I were to offer any criticism it would be that the white cameras on the front are pretty fragile and easy to break (and rare), the pilots don't seem to have any instrumentation, and the thrust of the 2 main engines might melt the docking cradle.  But overall, this set is a wonderful 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"speed27","2009-06-21T07:05:59.543Z","had a hard act to follow","the follow up to 928 was always going to be difficult. a brave new colour scheme and modular design are pluses. the lack of a ground base like 928 is its only drawback. the ground vehicles are cool as is the pull apart design. i have seen one of these done it the classic grey, blue and trans yellow and it looks awsome see (http://www.neoclassicspace.com/image/classic-galaxy-commander)
loses a point for no ground base like 928.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2015-07-20T09:35:06.793Z","The biggest and one of the best Classic Space sets","<p>This set wins the award for the largest piece count of any in the Classic Space theme - a full 30 parts more than 6985.&nbsp; (Okay, this disregards 70816 Benny&#39;s Spaceship (2014) but strictly speaking that&#39;s a Lego Movie set).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When reviewing sets such as this, comparisons are obviously and inevitably drawn between the various huge spaceships released by Lego over the years.&nbsp; Such comparisons are generally odious so I&#39;ll simply share some thoughts about the key features of this ship and call out some of the differences.</p>

<ul>
	<li>this set is the first to embrace the concept of modularity.&nbsp; The set splits into the front &quot;fighter bomber&quot; section and the rear &quot;mobile lab ascent/descent&quot; module.&nbsp; This rear module in turn can unhinge to deploy the mobile lab.&nbsp; This modularity was, at the time, a revolutionary concept and its success is demonstrated by the long line of Classic Space sets which followed it.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Along with 928, this set is one of the only large spaceships to include a large landing pad.&nbsp; For an apparently inert piece, the landing pad adds a surprising amount of play value.</li>
	<li>The inclusion of two vehicles in the set is a strong point in itself, but&nbsp;leads directly into one of the set&#39;s key drawbacks: the spaceship cannot carry a vehicle like 928 can.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Speaking of 928, it is the better set.&nbsp; If you have limited dollars and a choice between this set&nbsp;and 928, get 928.&nbsp; 6980 is a classic set; 928 is an icon that was a key part of turning Lego from a successful toy company into a global megabrand.</li>
	<li>This set is on a par with 6929 in terms of quality but is considerably larger.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The five included minifigs are a perfect number for this set and come in three colours (red/white/yellow), which were all that were available in 1983.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>There are some annoying flaws - there are some frustrating &quot;non-airtight&quot;&nbsp;gaps in the rear of the cockpits&nbsp;of the front section, and in the mobile lab (at the point where it joins the blue section and where the roof closes).&nbsp;&nbsp;However a&nbsp;few spare bricks and plates added in strategic places cure these issues.&nbsp; The laser guns (or whatever they are) on the front of the spaceship are also annoyingly&nbsp;fragile and are indeed very prone to cracking, particularly&nbsp;after all these years.&nbsp; The set loses a point on parts for this reason.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>This set is better than anything in Futuron.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you face a choice between any&nbsp;Futuron set and this one,&nbsp;get this one.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall this set deserves its reputation as a classic and should be near the top of your &quot;must get&quot; list if you are interested in collecting Classic Space.&nbsp;</p>

"Hitokiri_2000","2021-08-01T15:57:16.737Z","Long awaited set in 1983","<p>As I have written in my previous reviews, I&#39;m not really the typical reviewer.</p>

<p>I have always loved the Lego Classic Space theme.</p>

<p>Born in 1979 I was 4 years old when this set came out and I still to this day remember the long wait from the release of the new Lego Catalogue every January.</p>

<p>Now I know this set was released in February and February comes right after January. But for a four-year-old kid that&#39;s like a whole year. at least it was for me. So when it finally came out, I was ecstatic. And I have no shame in admitting my mom assembled it the first time and I played with it for hours and hours on end along my other Space sets. I remember that I got some extra crater plates&nbsp;and Space road plates too, so I could make a moon surface layout on the floor in my room.</p>

<p>Sadly my original 6980 set has taken a lot of sun damage. I still have it, but I really am sad about the fate I gave it along with most of my other classic Space sets. Lots of sun damage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have later got my hands on another set that was not damaged by sunlight. And I won&#39;t lie should I stumble upon another set that&#39;s in good condition at a fair price I will buy it in a jiffy. One can never have too many of the same set.</p>

<p>Should anyone fancy a look at some of my classic Space collection then you can follow this link.&nbsp;https://www.rcgalleri.dk/fotoalbum/off-topic/39345-klassisk_rum_lego It&#39;s a Danish Radio Control Forum site, so the writing is naturally in Danish. Should you feel the urge to flip through all the 104 pictures, you will eventually see Benny&#39;s Spaceship from the first Lego Movie and although it technically does not have anything to do with the classic space sets from the late 70&#39;s and up through the 80&#39;s I still feel it does have some small connection to the classic sets. Especially sets like 918, 924 and of course 928. The 929 number on the side of the cockpit fits right in with the classic lot.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T14:16:00.603Z","A very old Favourite! Spaceship!!!!!","<p>The Galaxy Commander. Owning one is a dream of nostalgic AFOLS everywhere.</p>

<p>I love this set for a multitude of reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building classic space requires no special techniques. It&#39;s great for the young and old a like, but possibly a little boring if not coated in nostalgia. Hence the score of just 3 for building.</p>

<p>This set got me some great parts. The blue cockpits, numerous slopes and fins are all great for other sets you can make in the same style and highly interchangeable with other classic space stills. I for one miss hinged cockpits in modern Lego.</p>

<p>Playability is out of this world. Literally. There&#39;s a sensor pod with a minifig, two moon buggies, the separable cockpit section. There is so much play to be had with little direction. We still had imaginations in the 80s..... Didn&#39;t need our themes spoon fed to us.</p>

<p>Pros -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iconic set!</p>

<p>Many space minifigs.</p>

<p>Lots of options for play with buggies, ship, landing pad etc...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>Guns / sensors on the front of the cockpit section are very loosely attached.</p>

<p>Blocky simple&nbsp;construction (that I love but has limited wider appeal)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As internet prices show, still a popular kit, in part due to the limited supply. This model brings a smile to my heart&nbsp; and lives in the centre of my Lego Lunar City.</p>
