"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-07T19:07:30Z","A good BT2 set, but more a fighter than a flagship","Lets start out with the good:  
Large, neon-green BT2 windscreen

Two rovers that can be lowered to the surface by a ramp that is automatically triggered by the opening of the aforementioned BT2 windscreen. 

Two of those detachable pods that are the trademark of the theme.  

And now the bad:   

For the second largest set in the theme, it's really not very large.  In that, it is really inferior to other second-biggest sets such as the Deep Freeze Defender and Robo Guardian.  I've compared it to the Saucer Centurion and Star Hawk II, and it seems more that size.  However, it costs much more.

When the pods are removed, the main ship has no controls.  You'd think with that giant windscreen there would be a huge amount of space for 'figs, but that area is used to house rovers, not serve as a cockpit.  

One annoyance:  At the back of the ship (you can't see it in the photo) is a 0ctagonal canopy.  It LOOKS like it could be used to house a minifig, but nooo, it backs up onto a solid wall of bricks.  As near as I can tell, it's for storing the jetpack that comes with one of the 'figs.

Bottom Line:

Looks good, but it doesn't use its interior space well at all.  Form over Function.

Hence, when I was five and my mom brought me the parts for several Blacktron II sets, I was in awe. Unfortunately, there were no instructions or box I could go by, and all those sets stayed in pieces for almost  ten years...

It was in 2001 I discovered Brickshelf, and using the instructions found there, I was able to recreate many Blacktron II sets, including this Aerial Intruder. I only lacked one part, and that is one of the white booster rockets underneath the ship. Nevertheless, I was extremely impressed. The ability of the ship to be opened and release two small vehicles was pure genius, as were the detatchable pods. The storage room in the back is a bit loose when it comes to holding the jetpack, but it still works. Aside from that, the ship is mostly eye-candy. It contains some very nice parts though.

To think it sat in storage as spare parts for my MOCS for so long! Now, it is one of my prized possessions. I will never rid myself of this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Aaronlego","2006-07-07T07:26:51Z","AWSOME ship","This ship is soooo cool! I love how the GIANT window opens up and out rolls two nice cars down a ramp. Also, the two pods deteach to protect the ship while its loading troops and stuff. The creators used a great selection of Trans-light green windows! The only downside is the jetpack storage. Whenever I try to pull the jetpack out, the whole back just crumbles. Also, who needs a jetpack like that anyhow?? Overall, the set is a very cool ship. Its recommended by me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-15T16:53:44.833Z","5/5 great structure","This set is definetely my favorite blacktron 2 set that i own, and for very good reasons.  The way the cockpit opens and the two rovers slide down is just down right cool.  I love the two pods that the drivers sit in.  THe white jetpack that was common to blacktron 2 sets never really attracted my attension.  I like the black airtanks way better.  It is, however, cool the way that the white jetpack can be stored in the back octagonal dome section.  If there was more overall space in this set, then it would be a lot cooler.  It looks almost semicircle shaped.  The picture that brickset has doesn't show it from the top, but I just love that veiw of it.  Two figures, great oeices, and overall a great LEGO set.  Don't pass up a single chance to obtain this masterpeice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"haoye","2007-07-29T05:30:32.94Z","Redesigned 6932: Stardefender 200","This was the first set that I ever requested (I had previous sets that my parents had just bought), which I got for Christmas 91.  The design is quite impressive, specifically the ramp mechanism for the two rovers, as well as the size given how few &quot;actual&quot; pieces there were.  I was also impressed with the design for the two detachable pods, later modifying the design for MOCs by adding larger wings and body.  The one bad part about this set is the lack of reusable pieces.  This was evidenced by the MOC designs on the back showing lots of large hollow alternate constructions.  Still, the actual design of the set itself is quite noteworthy and works well as a complement to other sets.

Whenever I looked through older catalogs, the Stardefender 200 (6932) always seemed like a predecessor to this set.  (Both share the two pods and one large translucent panel.)  I think this set pulls off the sleek look a little better.  The Stardefender 200 always looked like it had bulky side pods.  (Admittedly, I never owned one, but it just looks that way.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-24T20:03:45.763Z","A great set.","When I first saw the Blacktron 2 sets I was disappointed.  They look nothing as dramatic and sinister as the original Blacktron range, and those stupid 'B' logos on the astronaut uniforms look like a 7-year-old's sweater with the first letter of his name on it.  That was the problem with attaching the Blacktron name to these sets.  People are just going to compare them to the original range, which is unfair, as I honestly think that these sets are good enough not to need the Blacktron name tacked on to help them sell.  This set, for example, is a fantastic model.  The two control pods detach to form smaller ships and the big half-arch piece can be raised in order to lower a ramp for two little moon buggies.  There is also a jet-pack in a storage compartment at the back of the main spacecraft.  All in all, a fine set, and those globe-shaped cockpits are an all-time masterpiece of designing.

"krysto2002","2008-07-20T15:24:29.577Z","The brother to the Stardefender 200","This set has an obvious similarity to the Stardefender 200's design, with two detachable scouts with the absolutely amazing control stick (really looks cool) plus the design for the scouts is stunning! The overall design of the set is amazing and blows away the Futuron set by a longshot! What always has and always will continue to impress me is that when you open up the main compartment, the ramp actually lowers and raises (when closed) all on its own!! WOW!! Plus to top off the playability, the two rovers are sloped (you don't see that much!) and the extra jetpack keeps the second pilot from suffocating since his white pack does not fit in the scout. Plus the ship has a spare compartment in the back for the extra pack! The set is also great for parts since it can easily be rebuilt into a base.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aqualize","2010-01-07T07:18:47.843Z","Good but could be better","I must say I'm not totally satisfied with this set. It could have been improved. First of it is quite large but much empty space and two shuttles and two rovers makes (duplicate parts) it actually not so massive (comparing the parts count of this and later space themes' man ship it's not so many).
Yes, it is cool with the automatic lowering of the ramp and the rovers roll out by themself. But when the shuttles have detached the whole thing is just a big dumb hull. One would expect some cockpit and having a third minifigure included.
And its a disappointment that the dome on the back of the ship only holds a jetpack, it could have been more things.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"ClassicLegosAreBetter","2012-12-10T02:53:51.733Z","I always did want a dual cockpit Lego spaceship...","<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Minifigures:</span> Vintage Lego spacemen agents with the famous Lego space logo, the green ""B,"" on each torso. The very first Lego Space antagonist organization featured cool-looking real minifigures unlike the weird grotesque space villain minifigs in Space Police 3, Galaxy Squad, and other recent space themes.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Rovers: </span>Small recon vehicles made for taking one agent each on spy missions. These little rovers are very maneuverable and look great for infiltrating enemy bases while trying to remain low-key and hidden from Space Police officers. My only complaint here is that one Blacktron agent gets an armed jet-pack while he rides a rover, but there is no weapon for the other agent to hold while he rides the other rover. The rovers are themselves weaponless so if the Space Police discover the rover with the unarmed Blacktron agent he is in big trouble and has no defense.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Detachable Fighter Craft:</span> No need however for armed jet-packs or weapons when the agents are in command of these. These two fighter craft look fast and highly maneuverable wielding a set of space guns on each wing.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Dual Cockpit Spaceship: </span>Put them all together and you get the fearsome Blacktron flagship. Each fighter craft attaches to opposite sides of the vessel and the rovers are loaded in the central bay. Behind the ship is a cool storage unit to put in the armed jet-pack and other accessories the agents may need. Mine has an extra space gun in it for the non-jet-packed agent when he rides the rover or goes on foot reconnaissance. Finally the front of the ship wields two of the most powerful looking lasers I've ever seen on a Lego space vessel, tank or ship.<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Overall:</span> As stated before my only concern with this set is that there is only one weapon in the storage unit so only one agent can wield a weapon while they are out on the rovers. This weakens its ground assault capabilities greatly and causes the other rover to become an easy target when they are on a mission. That however is easily fixed by simply packing an extra space gun or two in the storage unit. Ultimately this is one well-equipped Lego spaceship and when properly armed, the agents in control of this ship have the capability of taking on a whole Space Police troop single-handedly.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"scrocchiazzeppo","2022-07-23T12:19:16.183Z","That fearsome glare!","<p>When you come to blacktron 2 sets, it&#39;s always about underrated sets. Aerial intruder is often seen as the copy of Stardefender 200. But.. what if you try to put them side by side? When you give a closer look at Stardefender 200 you can see all the flaws of its design, such as the main cockpit does not close, the pods without any control panel or whatever control grip, and so on. Then you look at the aerial intruder and you see two side pods which are the main control units, the central cockpit transformed into a cargo unit with an interesting giggle mechanism to land two buggies as soon as you open the big central glass, also some big thrusters on the rear so that classic space fans can feel relaxed. Let&#39;s keep it simple, aerial intruder has a brilliant design.</p>

<p>Moreover, it can be displayed to look really cool and deathly. You can appreciate it in full when you put aerial intruder suspended inside your display: I used two fine threads knotted to my Ikea display lateral supports to suspend the spaceship without any transparent stand, so that the Aerial intruder can fly over some goofy solar snooper. Just put the aerial intruder to look straightforward with its nose tilted a little down and it feels like an apache helicopter sneaking out of a hill, ready to blast some space police vehicle and free the prisoners. This peculiar look is mainly given by three elements: the big blacktron print on the big trans neon green windglass which feels like a big eye; the two rotating white blasts over the central windglass; the two black supports used like wings, resembling the side weapon supports of the apache helicopter.</p>

<p>Overall it is a great add-on to a collection because it is still relatively cheap and it creates a very dramatic scene which captures the interest of everyone, even if there is a galaxy explorer on the next shelf!</p>
