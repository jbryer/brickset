I somewhat regret not getting one of these MISB at 1/3rd price.  However, this set has too many poor parts, the figures are mediocre at best, and there are no rare pieces in this set to rave about.  Not even the alternate models on the back of the box can save this set from being a disappointment.

For those who are as disappointed as I am, there is a nice medium sized spaceship in the 697 ideas book used from parts from this model.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-20T11:08:55Z","drip drip drip","Exploriens were sadly the last of the traditional space lego ranges, but we can be thankful they were mostly great sets. This, for example, must be the biggest spaceship the lego company ever designed. The craft is of colossal proportions and comes with three cockpits, a little ground buggy, folding wings, a rotating laser/transmitter and a wealth of pieces and elements. And with its first-rate colour scheme you could almost believe this is a revival of those classic Futuron sets.
I had not seen this set until the day I bought it. When I was looking at all of the new 1996 sets I saw this one and was totally amazed at the size of this set. Seeing how I had some money to spend I picked it up immediately. When I got home I ripped open the box and spilled all of the pieces on the carpet and built it as fast as I could. The overall look and feel of the set is really good.
The set consists of a front pilot area, a skinny middle section with some areas to hold weapons and the back area, which has the gigantic laser beam. The very back of this huge ship even has a place to stick a small ground vehicle. 
The front area, which is the pilot area, has the front cockpit for the chief to sit. This cockpit is quite spacious and has a lot of controls for one cockpit. The odd part about the cockpit is that there is a pin that holds the cockpit upright but when you pull the pin in the cockpit will tilt a little bit. I found this to be a cool function but the purpose of doing this is still confusing me. 
The area directly behind the cockpit is a very spacious workroom with a hologram in the middle for communication with other Exploriens. To the left and right of the workroom are two observation pits with 2x2x1 computer pieces, which I think look really neat. Pulling away two wing pieces and lifting a radar dish can access the workroom. Two Trans-blue sloped shields access the tow observation pits. 
Behind the workroom is another Trans-blue shield that really reveals nothing but you could hide some fossil tiles in there if you wanted to. 
Next is the skinny section that basically has two holding areas. One for fossil tiles and the other to hold lasers. The back part is by far the coolest section of the whole ship. The center of the section has a large laser that could easily blow up any ship that got in its way. There are two walls that can somewhat cover up the laser. The back section also has two long arms that can move up and down and swivel. One arm has a magnet to grab the fossil tiles and the other arm has Trans-red and blue discs on it to see what the fossil tile reveals (I think this is a dumb idea). The back area also has two very wide wings with very large missiles that can be taken off at the ends. One thing that you may or may not see at first glance is that you can pull out two pins located on the wings and when you do that AND lift the ship of the ground the wings will bend at a 45-degree angle. This function is very well designed and makes the ship look awesome when you fly it around. 
As if all of this wasn't enough this monstrous set also comes with a little rover, which is used to pick up fossil tiles by means of a magnet or a &quot;pincher&quot;. This rover has a very unique design in that it only has two wheels that are in the back and the front is held up by two booster pieces. This way of designing it surprisingly works well and looks pretty cool. 
By now you may be thinking that this is the perfect space set right? Wrong. There are a few things that could have been avoided in this set. First of all the work room and observation pits are not enclosed totally, there are a lot of openings which really bugs me because I think they could have designed it a bit differently to fix this. The other thing that makes the set look a bit ugly is the radar thingy that sits on top of the workroom. The form of the ship looks really sleek and cool until you put this thing on. If I were you I would put on at first to see what you think but I'm sure you'll want to take this thing off soon after.
Other than those two little complaints I think this set is a total blast! It is nicely designed and actually takes quite a long time to build up. I was very pleased to see this set giving away three Trans-blue slanted shields. If you are a space collector and you want the largest ship of all then pick this set up. I highly recommend it.

It has a surprisngly sturdy middle section that is supported by a few beam bricks. (I dont know the dimensions). The back section is way cool! It has a large laser blaster gun that can easily destroy any other vessels or targets like the Spyrius Robo Guardian. It has neat wings that can fold dependinging on were it is.

As a kid, I got extremely frustrated trying to get the wing-dropping mechanism to work right during construction, and gave up on it for a week, but afterwards, it was entirely worth it. The cockpit dropping feature is useless, and I always wondered why it was there, so I used it as an evacuation mechanism that would shoot the cockpit off in it's own little ship. The telescope in the back is very nice, as with the satellite, and I see no problem with the ship not being &quot;airtight&quot;. After all, if you took off your helmet, and the ship got hit and punctured, what would you do? Stability-wise, I never had any problems with it, until I cracked the ship in half manually once (direct blow from those dirty Spyrius scum!!), which significantly weakened the midsection. Eventually, we ended up fusing it with the android base and various other Explorien sets and making the Explorien base. Of course, the parts all got lost or stolen, and regrettably I lost all my LEGOs to charity. However, this will be the first set I'll be buying.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Cashcleaner","2007-02-27T15:38:22.84Z","Still my favourite kit","Even after all these years, the Expolriens Starship is still my top kit for building and displaying.  The overall design is bulky and utilitarian but it is still able to give off an effective impression of speed, as well.

The cockpit and forward fuselage is loaded with lots of internal details such as a communications panel in the central cockpit area and computer terminals for the pilot and command staff.

The middle of the kit consists of a long and narrow fuselage connecting the fore and aft sections.  While at first it would look to be a weak spot for the kit, I've found it to be quite solid and has yet to snap in half  from the weight of the rest of the model.

The rear section of the kit features a large communications array which folds out from it's housing and two heavy weapons pylons or wings which can fold down to give the ship a more sleek look in flight.  Lastly, a small land vehicle and robot operator finishes off the rear of the kit.

The cockpit redefines ships wth the single control stick. The main lab/base is though flimsy and too bare, it can easily be filled with computers and tools, plus don't criticize a ship that was not meant to be a base, since the exploriens ALREADY have a base!! The detachable pod seems a little lost in the back, but since the thrusters are on the outside that can be excused. The cabin in the back opens and colses nicely, although I can't seem to figure out what the sattelite like machine was meant to be! Use your imagination, I used to pretend it was a laser, that when amplified by the sattelite in the front (finally a use for it!) made an incredible laser which comically fried the Blacktrons! With plenty of tools and the center which makes a great handle for holding the ship, this is on my top ten list of sets. The most importantant flaws are that the sattelite, though necesssary (since it matches the one in the android base and makes sense that it would allow contact with the rest of the fleet), takes away from the sleek design. Lastly, the folding details of the cockpit and wings is nice, but the wings tend to fold down too far a,d make the ship look too much like a bird that is over flapping its wings.

"keithyw","2010-01-25T15:07:04.233Z","My #2 or #3 (Depending on the day)","I couldn't wait to purchase this set when I first heard about it.  It looked epic in the few pages from a catalog that I spotted.  Also, since this was before Lego.com, there wasn't any way to discern the components of this ship.  You could see the land rover, but where did it go?  Was the set going to be modular?  What secrets did it possess that a quick glance could not immediately reveal?

That's the type of set that really whets your appetite.  These days, I barely even bother looking at the rear to see what can be done with the set.  I want to be surprised to a degree.  So when I started building it, there were, indeed, many surprises.

The first one was that the ship for the most part is ""whole"".  Not as much modularity as you would believe, especially considering the sheer size and how other ships in the past have been constructed by Lego.  The front cockpit section, I thought originally, could be separated, but instead, it provides an angled ""dip"" that looks like a hawk or bird ready to pounce on its prey, once the little pin on the side is pulled down.  Besides the pin, there's really nothing besides gravity that holds the cockpit firmly in a straight position.

Behind it, sits what essentially is a laboratory or ""base-like"" component.  Surprisingly, this section does not separate, even though it feels that it ought to.  Because of the way the pictures were shot, it's hard to tell that the underside of this section is ""bare"".  You have wing type of sections vaguely providing the underbelly structure.  Here's one of those instances where if an astronaut suddenly removed their helmet on the moon while the group was exploring, they'd perish instantly.

I think there's a few instruments in this area, including an LCD-like monitor.  It's a very odd design, imo, because the top seems far more armored than the bottom.  But I don't see the purpose in that.  Also, the top's ""flower"" like radar/pod seems to function either as an antenna and/or a cannon, depending on its position.  During flight, you can actually move that section forward such that it can aim at a target while the wings around it unfold.  

One thing I do appreciate though, which made me an instant fan, is the use of the three blue canopies along with the winged cockpit.  That design had a great deal of aesthetic appeal.  It made the ship look like you had various people in control, guiding it around.  However, underneath it is a flimsy, and the astronauts are completely exposed from the waist down.  A well aimed laser blast will easily find its mark if these guys incite any aliens.

Then you get to the rear section.  Originally, I thought that the various hinged sections that covered over some hidden element would be akin to the Galaxy Commander's use of a vehicle roof element, that locked down the middle section to the primary section of the craft.  Instead, those are merely compartments to store discoveries.  The rear section (in a disappointing way) does not separate.  
Instead, it serves three purposes.  One is to provide a spot to connect to the little exploratory surface vehicle.  Another purpose is to house the laser cannon/telescopic device in the rear (which is odd described in such terms).  

Finally, you had the grand design of the set, which is the massive wing section.  That section borrows slightly from the Technic side because of the complexity involved.  You have these flaps that prevent the axles from sliding in, allowing the wings to fold down.  When the wings are folded down, along with the tilted front cockpit, the ship gives a more menacing appearance.  It's a very unique design that I can't recall being replicated anywhere in space Lego.  It does suffer somewhat because the wings are extremely heavy and the flaps can be broken off with the strong flick of a finger.  Also, the sides aren't heavily reinforced so with enough accidental force, you can easily snap an entire wing off.

One curious thing about the wings though is that they both bear detachable rocket pods.  I'm not sure why they would use a technique like this.  Since the rocket pods are the only thing that seems to be able to propel this monstrous craft forward, detaching them or launching them as a weapon type seems pretty moot. The craft does have some form of engines underneath, but without the large side rocket pods, the only purpose of those two engines would appear to be having a softer landing.

I consider this my #2 or #3 favorite large ship because there are some visual/design flaws and clear architecture flaws.  It's really big and unwieldy.  But visually it's impressive and original.  There's a lot of other elements going into this ship that are great.  The sheer amount of moveable parts add the playability factor.  Plus, it's just a fun ship to build.  When you finish, you have a really good sense of accomplishment and it's nice to admire.

"dim","2010-03-12T13:45:15.153Z","Not a favorite","<p>This has to be the poorest large spaceship Lego ever produced. Already judging from the box picture I had thought that it looked bizarre but I bought it because I had an idea&nbsp;of converting it into a (10 times better) Futuron flagship. However I built it once out of curiosity before creating my own MOC and I found it really poor.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This spaceship is actually very large, maybe the largest until the 5974 - <em>Galactic Enforcer</em> came out. The spaceship is divided in two sections; The front is by far the best part. It is primarily constructed by four Exploriens wing panels placed in a cross-like arrangement to create a rather interesting shape. The cockpit can tilt like a Concorde nose, which makes it very aggressive.&nbsp;The rest of the front section is a lab but unfortunately it is not airtight. Actually it is really exposed in a very unrealistic way which one would not expect from such a big model. Another drawback is that the overlarge radar looks like a flower and destroys completely the sleekness of the front.</p>
<p>The middle section houses some cheesy Exploriens holographic tiles and a toolbox in one of the most unlikely places imaginable.</p>
<p>The rear section looks like it can be detached but actually it cannot. It houses this Exploriens laser/radar thingy under a canopy. It also includes a mechanism that lets the wings tilt, and two explorative arms.&nbsp;The entire design is a disaster; it looks like a haphazard pile of bricks. The canopy can never cover properly the laser which looks like a badly squeezed Jack-in-the-box. It is also stupidly connected to the wing mechanism which means, once you tilt the wings, the canopy has to stay open. The wings look very splintery and end in two really ugly missiles that sit on transversally mounted car wheels (???)</p>
<p>The extra rover is on the contrary really nice; it looks deliberately 'robotic'. However&nbsp;there is no proper place for it&nbsp;in this overlarge spaceship, it has to hang exposed on the rear.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Admittedly&nbsp;the spaceship&nbsp;looks better live than on the disastrous picture of the box, but it's still no real&nbsp;beauty.</li>
<li>It has a nice colour scheme; like the rest of the series it is pretty much a re-hatch of the Futuron colours, so one cannot go too wrong with them.</li>
<li>The mechanism that tilts the nose is nice</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limited&nbsp;playability, not thought through functions, cheesy&nbsp;details (see description above),</li>
<li>Ugly design of the rear section</li>
<li>Space usage; the spaceship is one of the largest and it utilizes almost half of the length to cover (badly) a laser... </li></ul>

They were essentially space paleontologists who found holographic tiles, these gave three different views: naked eye, red lens and blue lens. The revealed xenomorph was a fun way to scan their finds.

<p>Near unbelievably&nbsp;good, Lego just kept upping their game through the mid 1990s. The hair prints enabled some character through a visor and they had radio link&nbsp;speaker prints too. The grey&nbsp;and white is simply stunning for a sci-fi&nbsp;design and besides the decent symbol and equipment prints, the droid is simply marvelous. Even better than the Spyrius&nbsp;droid.</p>

<p><strong>Space Goose</strong><br />
Here we have something of a beast to build. It feels like a giant bird-like craft. Main sections get a chunky, strong build but are linked by thinner structures. Amazing pieces are used to good effect and the craft takes shape in a way different to other spaceships. The multiple cockpits suggest an exploratory craft indeed and are arranged very nicely. The bridge is strong with an interesting roof that opens in three sections in different ways feeling like an airlock. Boosters and landing pads keep getting added while computers and lights are smattered throughout the build. A technic lock is featured and later reveals to dip the entire cockpit, just for sheer design enhancement and take off!</p>

<p>The bi-coloured scanner is portable on one robotic arm while a magnet is on the end of another. This can hold the tiles. The ship goes back further and further to a strange arrangement of wing or tail like rear with technic axles that bind it together. Side rolling&nbsp;wheels allow a drop-ship&nbsp;mechanism whereby the wings hang down when taking off to flight. These have locks and a reasonably pointless lock is added near a cockpit. The huge radar transmitter or cannon is stunning and gets a secure housing that like the cockpits is not secure from the vacuum. The first rule of being a Lego astronaut is &#39;don&#39;t take your helmet off&#39;. The extra gubbins on this spaceship just goes on; engine boosters, loads of floodlights, a beautiful radar receiver and a space beetling vehicle with a robotic arm and magnet, yes he can cling on to the ship&#39;s magnet for a ride.</p>

<p><strong>Special Effects</strong><br />
It&#39;s a credit to the product design that the instructions show how to operate the various locks for the flight motion and even include some alternative designs. Unusual: the instructions seem to repeat a cockpit roof step or did I not get something?&nbsp;The fluorescent&nbsp;extremities and classic blue cockpits and shields caught my eye and this was an amazing looking box and set to track down. Space had not appealed this much since the classic years so I took a gamble and tried something different much later than the release year. The clean white bricks are very attractive and suitable for such a design. It is reminiscent of many comics and sci-fi&nbsp;stories I have read or seen on screen. It is a mere flaw that the structures are too thin between sections and that the main holds are not sealed but the design remains attractive. I tried an alternative design but can not win yet and so I&#39;m tempted to keep what is a stand out superb ship that is not the best structurally built but is cool as Pluto.</p>

"Faefrost","2014-07-28T21:26:56.297Z","Large distinct ship is a mixed bag","<p>This was Lego&#39;s largest Space ship for a long long time. And it deserves extra special consideration for that alone. It is a very different&nbsp;very unusual ship. It would probably be one of the best sets Lego ever offered and a true classic save for the overall frailty of sections of it and the weird Futuron parts.</p>

<p>The set was going for something different than the previous Lego large capital ships. It appears almost skeletal on purpose. A large long and wide deep space exploration ship with huge radar and sensor arrays, the wings with main engines out on trestles a definite split between the living section (front pod) and the engines and support section (aft end) separated by a long spar. It brings to mind something out of 2001 a Space Odyssey, Silent Running, The Cygnus from the Black Hole, The Explorer class ships from Babylon 5&nbsp;and some other gems of classic SciFi. While still maintaining some semblance of the classic Lego winged space ship. Unfortunately the blending is not always a happy hybrid.</p>

<p>The ship has two distinct modes landed mode, where the entire ship is a flat T shape like most classic space ships. And flight mode where the wings pivot down to a distinctive 45 degree angle from the ship and the cockpit nose drops to give it a hawklike profile. This flight mode makes the ship look 100x better. Unfortunately you will never ever see it, except when you pick the ship up to swoosh it. Because in flight mode there is no way to set the ship down. Or rather setting it down returns it to landing mode. (see those wheels on the wingtips. They are to protect and retract the wings when you set it down.)</p>

<p>So it looks good while you are holding it and swooshing it? well yes... for about 5 seconds. At which point it starts shedding major components. There are so many frail and flimsy connections on this thing. Heck the fron cockpit is help on by 2 1x2 finger hinge pieces. Literally that&#39;s all that is keeping the nose on. The floor of the lab / living area is only supported by a small number of studs. so it frequently drops off into the vastness of space. There are no side walls in any of the crew areas save the front pilot cockpit. In the rest of the ship the crew sits with their lower halves completely exposed. And the whole of the front is made up of those big honking ugly sloped Explorian&nbsp;wing / cockpit pieces with few connection points, no reinforcement and the front is under almost constant strain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. The set has many positives. It looks much better than the picture would have you believe. It is play feature rich with lots to do. It has 4 great minifigs. And the ship as a whole makes logical sense froma sci fi standpoint. Moreso than most other Lego ships. It&#39;s just kind of fragile.</p>
