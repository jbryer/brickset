      Nice little vehicles
      Two rockets
      Ice Babe
      Some cool big pieces
      
Cons: Not much inside more off a site than a home
      Not much else to base

Verdict: One of the nicest Ice Planet 2002 sets in my opinion. Buy it if you can.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-01T06:17:00Z","One of the best bases.","A pretty substantial and beefy set with few flaws.

The good:
-Great color scheme, but then again i might be the only person on earth who likes it
-The icebabe
-Great vehicles, especially the sled-thingy, thats a set in on itself.
-great functionality. you can smoothly transport and launch rockets with the transport, crane, and launchpad without using &quot;the hand of god&quot; to make the rockets jump around.
-a white baseplate!
-one of the only subthemes with a solid premise, despite the fact that the rockets look a bit archaic in the superfuture of lego space. and 2002? is that the year 2002 or is there 2002 ice planets?

The bad:
-what is it with lego and being squemish about using more than 3 minifigs in a set?
-the transparent antennas on the security gate fall off alll the time
-as much as i like the sled thingy, the base needs a flying vehicle too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

(Big Ugly Rock Piece). Comes with a great rocket, cool ice planet veichles and choice minifigs. I love the snow shoe racks the magnetised rocket and the translucent orange quarter domes especially.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-22T07:55:24Z","Awesome","my favorite space set and probably my favorite set ever.  When I was younger I found it really hilarious to chuck the ice planet rockets at the spyrius sets I had.  They did some good damage too.  I like the rocket launchpad and the neat mobile arm that has a dock to set an extra rocket.  I didn't like the little antenna that moved up and down in the back of the base.   I was also disappointed with the vehicles that came with the set, but the base itself more than made up for it.  It would have been sweet to get some sort of vehicle with oversized white wheels and like several rocket compartments, but I guess I can't complain since I played with this set so much. Thank god I held onto all the pieces and still have all the instruction manuals !",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-28T19:42:21Z","Incredible!","WOW! This set rocks! The rockets are cool, I love the minfigs, (It needs more than 3 minfigs. More like 5.) The little rocket 
hauler thingie is awesome! Overall this is great set! Buy it if you can!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-27T19:01:37.223Z","Underated","This set is awesome. Ice Planet was imho Lego's best Space theme and not surprisingly, imho this is Lego's best space base. This set has a great mechanism for loading the rockets and two good vehicles. On the downside, there isn't much substance to this set and it lacks the pieces count of the Deep Freeze Defender, which is overall a better set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PepperPizzaMan2585","2009-10-27T14:47:05.92Z","One of the greatest sets of all time!","I got this set with the box and instructions, and I have to say, it is a pretty cool set. The base has alot of detail. It comes with two rockets, 3 mini figures, a rocket transporter, and a sled. I don't play with it alot though, I mostly just display it on my shelf. So overall, this is an awesome set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wander_eddie","2012-01-06T15:36:46.863Z","Ice Station Odyssey","<p>When I entered the world of Leg at large after first modest steps, thanks my premier catalog, it was a spring of 1993. Adventurous pirates battling outnumbered soldiers on ships or islands of Pirate theme were greeting me alongside enigmatic Dragon Masters, evasive Wolfpack or trickish Black Knights from Castle. Third big theme I could have never forgot anymore was the mystical Space. Legendary Space police, iconic Blacktrons and Ice Planet 2002. This set is about the main base of the last mentioned. <br></p><p>And by the way - a cup of hot tea or chocolate could come in handy. It is going to be really, really cold.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Ice Planet Odyssey is located in a chilly depths of our galaxy on the small planet Krysto, hundreds of lightyears away from Earth. It is a surface space station and it serves as an outpost with launching platform.&nbsp; Due to the hostile environment, there are only three astronauts. Comander astronaut, astronaut and star babe. They have nice thorsos, but the commander has a different one. The minifigs are very, very lovable, however I would welcome two more astronauts. At the number of computers (3), vehicles (6) and mechanisms they would fit the bill. The station is build on the usual baseplate, well know from castles (Dragon Masters, Lion Knights) or pirates (Guards, Pirates). The colours are blue and white, However, the hole in the middle has no uses. I can image there at least some case of storage or something, it is uselessly empty. When the two energetic gates are managed, you are at the very heart of the station. Computers, commanders´chair and controlling mechanism of launching platform are here. Becase the winds on Krysto are deadly icy, there are the red transparent windows located on the one side. When moving the launching platform up and down, it is also moving the satelite dish. Do not forget about the radar /But not the guy from M.A.S.H./ On the second, completely white platform, there is a magnetic crane. It is used to transport a rocket from the snow or truck to platform. Two rockets are present at the base. Even when the technology of Ice planet has already discovered the technology of faster than light speed travelling, rockets are still in the service as veracious transports of satelites on to the orbit. There are two communications satelites in this set. With rockets, snow truck and snow sledge they are in service of this base. So, what to say more? It is a good set, I am very glad to have it. Some may disagree, but I would prefer this one over many of earlier and later space sets too. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>- Unique and charming colours</li><li>- Plenty of playability, even without other sets<br></li><li>- Numerous vehicles such as rockets, satelites, sledge or snow truck</li><li>- Very nice minifigs</li><li>- Box and instruction</li></ul><p><br></p><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>- Small number of very nice minifigs</li><li>- As a solely base on Krysto, the central could have been equiped more</li></ul><br><p>But final thoughts are clearly positive. And not only because this set was one of those, which have welcomed me to Lego world. You know, this is the kind of set you can be starring at for hours and hours. Brilliant managed in terms of colours, with great idea of snowy, cold world the set has a drive. I dare not to say it is the best lego base. Maybe there were better. But it is the most original one and it is worth of every cent I invested to purchase it from Germany. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"krysto2002","2008-07-20T16:22:23.013Z","The best of all older bases (excluding the monorails)","Like I said this is more of an outpost than a base since it doesn't have much to speak of on the inside. This &quot;outpost&quot; is still my favorite yet since in addition to looking cool it has a function and a purpose. While ships like the SAT-V picked up the sattelites, the base is designed to recieve, process and launch them, and it has every thing you need to do just that. The cheif sits back (probably sipping coffee) and controls the lift for lanching the sattelites, while a robotic arm loads them, and a worker prepares them by attaching the uplink (what else can I call it). The arm functions perfectly and the use of magnets keeps the rockets from just falling off, like when held by a claw (cough cough Mars Mission cough cough...) plus the mechanism for launching the rocket has the hinges that hold it in place (so cool!) What's better is that once launched and the mechanism rests back in place, the sattelite dish behind the base rises probalbly to receive the sattelite's data. The security system is tight, suprisingly tighter than most other bases (plus the computer that unlocks the electric fence is really cool). With just enough tools, minifigures plus the collection vehicle and turbo-sled (as I call it) this set tops all bases! (not to mention it includes the rare female Ice Planet &quot;babe&quot;).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mi_ma","2009-03-06T06:53:19.67Z","The second greatest base ever","The greatest base (without monorailes) was old blacktron base. I think this one is simpler, but the color shame is the best of all space themes. I've plaeyd all houres with this set. I really like the way you prepare rocket to launch. The small satelites looks very nice. All sets hae a lot of moving parts, like crane with magnet, radars and launch point. The base plate got the very nice looking drawings. It comes with rocket trasporter, little craft and three minifigs. All next bases form lego wasn't so good... but maybe in future...;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-04T06:49:49.773Z","LEGO Space (Ice Planet 2002) - Ice Station Odyssey Review","This is my only set of the LEGO Space (Ice Planet 2002) theme I've got. It has some cool pieces and some of them are really hard to find in the sets we get today. It also doesn't have any stickers which you have to worry about. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set.<br><br>The vehicles are very nice as well. We get two rockets, a sledge with two big skis and a truck which can transport a rocket. The trailer of the truck can be removed very easily and the trunk does open if you want to put the rocket in. The base itself omes with a laser gate and a screen with a lever on the front. The base plate looks like the one we got in the LEGO Space (Spyrius) set 6959 (Lunar Launch Site). There're also two big translucent orange window pieces which looks really awsome and on the top of the window you can see a radar which sviwels full 360°.<br><br>Inside the base you get another laser gate, a place where you can put the translucent orange chainsaw and a sviwel chair with a dashboard which controls the landing platform for the rocket. You can move the blue cylinder piece if you want to lift the rocket up and down. The rockets also have a magnet which is used to get these vehicles on the arm which can slide on the platform. The arm can sviwel up and down and full 360°. On the ground you can also see a platform where you can put the rockets and on the back of the base you can find a radar which lifts up and down. It's a really cool set and it's worth the money for sure. It's also a must have for all LEGO collector's.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
