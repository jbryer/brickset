The modular design is great the colour is amazing and the wings are beyond cool The little ground vehicle was good to get with the set. My only complaints are that it needs another fig and it needs more computers in the second section, apart from that it's amazing!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T14:33:33.39Z","Space Police II has one heck of a command ship","Wow, this ship is incredible.  It's far better than the Mission Commander from SP1 without a doubt.  The lines are smooth and beautiful, the wings well done, and the function good.  There are some things wrong with it though: it needs more &quot;stuff&quot; in the section behind the cockpit, another minifig is a must, and I always thought it was a little overpriced (or underpieced).  But despite these drawbacks I can't help but give it a rating of 5, what a beautiful ship!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-08T12:12:55.343Z","Cool space cruiser","I loved this spaceship when I was a child. It can be divided into three sections. You can fix the front section with the rear part. This allows you to use the middle part as some sort of provisional space station. However, when you remove the front section you can see the middle part with - and this has been mentioned in other reviews - a hole, which is quite disturbing. It doesn't look good. And the space ship doesn't have many weapons fixed on its hull. It looks quite defenceless. 

Anyway, the ship comes with lots of parts - there are many engines at its bottom - and three minifigs, namely two Space Police officers and a Blacktron guy. There are also two prison cells, where you can arrest the baddies.

"andy87","2008-11-20T16:36:38.997Z","Where are the weapons?","This set is really cool, but it has no weapons to speak of, unless you count those tiny missle things on the front. How is it going to get into a dogfight with no weapons? The little car doesn't have any either, unless you count his ugly megaphone.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dim","2010-05-21T13:38:23.17Z","Almost excellent is not enough for a Space Police flagship","<p>This is my least favorite of the three Lego Space Police flagship vessels, but still one great large spaceship. </p>
<p>This set is a direct replacement of the 6986 – Mission Commander, but it’s rather more of a spiritual successor to the 6985 – Cosmic Fleet Voyager of 1986. Just like the Cosmic Fleet Voyager, this spaceship features a nice double canopied cockpit but sadly exactly like in the original, the second upper canopy doesn’t cover an elevated control room as one might expect but only empty space. Of course with a couple of standard bricks and a computer slope one can easily build their own raised control room. Also similarly to the Cosmic Fleet Voyager, the Galactic Mediator is very spacious in its middle and rear section, but rather empty and lacking in detail. The middle section features only one computer slope placed on the floor and the aft section fits the rover that comes with the set. One can remove the middle section and shorten the fuselage connecting the cockpit with the aft section but the remaining middle part is not convincing as a stand-alone, provisional base like the second half of the Cosmic Fleet Voyager.</p>
<p>The highlight of the set though is hidden in the wings. They are double-layered and therefore vaguely reminiscent of a futuristic version of a biplane. The trick here is that they are hinged and by unlatching the side locks, one can open the wings to dock and undock the two -trademark for this series- prison cells in position. &nbsp;The mechanism is simple, yet so efficient that the prison pods are even lifted into position automatically from the ground once you close the wings around them.&nbsp; The original Space Police vessel, the Mission Commander featured a similarly clever system of docking the prison pods between fuselage and wings, but their removal required the complete undocking of the rear section of the spacecraft, which then could not be reconnected without the pods in position. I think the solution of the Galactic Mediator is equally elegant but also more logical.</p>
<p>Just like so many other reviewers, I also have to mention how poorly armed this set is for a Space Police flagship. And generally design-wise, it reminds vaguely a futuristic version of a NASA space shuttle and is thus not nearly as aggressive as the Mission Commander with its bird of prey design. I also believe that with so much space provided, the set could do with one more Police officer. My major gripe though with this set is the crude split function with pins on the lower part and snapping bricks on the upper side.&nbsp; It makes it rather difficult to attach and detach the three parts of the spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful Double Decker cockpit&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<li>Good space &nbsp; 
<li>Ingenious docking system of the prison pods&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of detail in interior&nbsp; 
<li>Poorly armed&nbsp; 
<li>Crudely realized split function</li></ul>
<p>This set is with no doubt one of the great Lego spaceships but in direct comparison to the original Space Police flagship, the Mission Commander, this set feels a bit conservative and&nbsp; lacking in innovation, whereas in comparison to the new Galactic Enforcer it lacks in detail and realism. Therefore 4 out of 5 bricks.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"dragon_teenager","2009-02-05T23:01:29.717Z","Best LEGO capital ship ever.","I have both this and the DFD, and I think this is the better of the two. I'll reduce my review to a simple pro-con list for clarity's sake:

PROS:
- Amazing, complete look
- Tons of interior space
- Awesome double-cockpit design
- Impressive size
- Docks two SPII jail cells
- Includes great Commander minifig
- The back compartment opens to allow a small rover down a ramp
- Finally, a Space Police ship with some propulsion! 
- Some neat accessories included

CONS:
- Somewhat scattered brick placement 
- The ship splits into sections, but it would immediately kill the crew since it leaves a gaping hole
- Rover is a bit of a throwaway
- Rover rattles around while stored inside the Mediator

Overall the complaints are very minor and I'd recommend this to any Space fan, or LEGO fan for that matter. It's the star of the Space Police fleet and one of the best sets in LEGO Space. Back in it's day, it was the king, and today it still impresses with a well realized design and tons of interior space. They are a little expensive now, but it's way worth it in my opinion!

"keithyw","2010-01-25T16:03:25.373Z","Better Than Part I","The original big space police ship had a number of flaws as I pointed out in a previous review.  So just as Lego decided to come up with Blacktron 2, they too decided to expand upon their nemesis: the Space Police.  Space Police 2 seemed in earnest to improve upon some of the design flaws.  I think this ship by comparison did a much better job compared to the first one, although I consider both ships to be very handsome in general.

I think the biggest improvement over with this ship was not wasting space.  The first one used that giant crank to open and close a canopy.  While innovative you really wasted a lot of yardage on a rather novel concept without any potential benefits from a logical point of design.  Here, we still get the surface vehicle, but smartly, it's been positioned in the rear base module, using the more familiar folding flap that opens the rear up.

The second major improvement is the enclosing space of the ship.  It's airtight and as a result, much more sturdy.  In fact, the design of this ship is quite reminiscent of the Cosmic Fleet Voyager.  Consider for instance, the use of the double canopied cockpit, the rear section holding spot for the surface vehicle, the corridor-like central parts and the slightly angled green translucent parts of the mid section.  Even the rear rader/thruster, if reversed, would bear an uncanny resemblance to the Cosmic Fleet Voyager.  Well, if you think about it, the Cosmic Fleet Voyager was a VERY well designed ship.  Air tight, long but sturdy, even if it was ugly.  So with a better looking front and a nice pair of wings to boot, you could say that this set borrows from both designs and addresses the flaws of each.

The prisons for this series are a little better as well.  They use a newer canopy type of piece to deposit the prisoners, rather than the translucent red antenna/laser-like parts.  Those make the storage for prisoners seem as though they were made as cryogenic freezers for long voyages across galaxies.  Gotta make sure you can bring those intergalactic criminals to justice!

Another cool element is the large number of thruster/pods underneath the craft.  They serve both seemingly as 1) weapons; 2) fuel tanks; 3) landing gear; 4) thrusters; 5) all the above.  Hard to say what their purpose is, but having that many gives you more possibilities to use those as spare parts in those contexts.  And speaking of thrusters, I like how they have three distinct, large thrusters for this craft.  The previous ship seemed to just glide with a few really tiny ones.  The larger thrusters employed here imply that this craft can travel through galaxies as its name suggests.

Of course, as with anything, I have complaints about the craft.  First, I dislike the color scheme.  It works to a degree, but I wish they kept the color schemes consistent between series for compatibility.  Who wouldn't want to combine the previous large ship with this one?  But green transparent and red transparent colors clash heavily, so you eliminate that possibility.  Section, the mid section of the craft, while being separable doesn't seem to serve any useful purpose.   It doesn't even look cool on its own, so I can't tell what the designers had in mind.  Compare that to the Cosmic Fleet voyager where you only had two sections.  But those two sections made sense in a way.  One could be a surface unit, serving as a base of operation, while the main craft could seek out new spots on a planet to investigate.

Third, which seems to be a common theme in this series for me, is that the set just is plain boring.  It's a good looking set, it's sturdy and well built, but I guess when you have those idioms in a set, you do sacrifice a bit on the playability side.  Sure, the wings open up to allow the prison cells to be detached and you have three modules (only two having an obvious purpose).  Not to mention the surface vehicle, which can oddly enough hold up one of the cells using the hook mechanism on its rear.  But there's is a sense of boringness about this set that I can't put my finger on.

I still love this set.  I think they did a great job in general with it.  But nothing is perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Mr__Thrawn","2018-04-26T17:20:12.007Z","A Bit Unusual, But Not Bad","<p><br />
This is the second classic (ish) space set that I have acquired, and the larger of the two in terms of piece count.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Well done and easy to follow. They don&#39;t ask you to put on too many parts per step,&nbsp;which is nice.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty easy, as is normal or a &#39;90s set. The hardest part was the wings, which were still extremely simple.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three minifigures in this set. The&nbsp;<strong>Space Police Chief&nbsp;</strong>is a figure I am not too fond of. His torso looks a bit weird. The&nbsp;<strong>Space Police II Officer&nbsp;</strong>is great, though. The print is very nice,a nd he looks like a space police officer should. The&nbsp;<strong>BlackTron II&nbsp;</strong>figure is awesome! He has a simple blacktron logo print and a nice trans-neon-green visor.</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>The model actually looks pretty cool when completed. Although it does look a bit patchy in terms of color, the shape is perfect. The double cockpit looks very nice, and while some complain about the lack of seat,&nbsp;a standing figure works, and if you sit a figure facing towards the back, they actually look through a small window into the main interior. The shape is good, with some nice angles, although the wing antennae are a bit finicky.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This is where the set stands out. The rear opens to release a rover, the top opens in two places to access the interior, and the cockpit opens. The interior has space for lots of figures, plus accessories on the walls, and some computers in the front. It&#39;s a bit bare, but needs to be utilitarian; it is, after all, a police craft. The best feature, though, is the wing function.. The wings can pick up and hold the prison pods. This is ingeniously done and works perfectly. The pods themselves can seat a minifigure&nbsp;each, and there are two in the set.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I like this set, but I recommend getting other Classic Space sets i.e. Galxy Explorer, StarDefender 200, first.</p>
