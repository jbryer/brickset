"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-08T16:15:54Z","Neat Ship!","  I first saw this and thought it was pretty ugly.  But its' actually a great set.  It has neat hatches inside the ship and and the end comes off to make a mobile labratory or something.  It does look bulky, but it's a lot more streamlined than it seems to be.  I would have liked it to have one more figure,though.      ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-02T04:13:20Z","critique","This is a nice set, and I start by rating it a 10, but then there are a few problems which knock it down.
Firstly, the nose is way too tapered, it needs to be chunkier.
A lot of larger and some smaller classic space sets have a little buggy, and this is by far the worst, it's so flat and simple. This is so it can be squeezed in to the back and fit snugly but it's still ugly.
There's plenty of space to fit extra men into but the thing is that it is extremely difficult to get them in.
Finally, the 4th minifig is white and not yellow (it just looks yellow through the trans yellow plastic.
It's in the same style as the 928 and 6980, but not as nice.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-06T16:17:10Z","A very large shell","This was the last large classic space ship produced and from the outside was a very good effort. As previously mentioned, the ship is a lot sleeker than it looks and there are a large number of different parts in this ship, so there are a nuber of building opportunities. Sadly I felt this ship had a number of flaws when compared to the 6980 and 924. When separated, the ground module was very good, but the front section appeared very stunted and I never found the propulsion mounted on the wings very convincing. My main issue was with the emtyness of the whole ship. What you see is what you get, there are vast areas on nothingness in there, its just a shell. The picture shows a minifig looking out of the window, he's probably desperatly trying to find something to do before he dies of boredom! Nice ship, bit its just a shell.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-03-30T15:16:46.64Z","Finally after 20 years","After 20 years of wanted one of this set I was able to buy one on E-bay, and it only cost me 14.5 pounds.  
With this space ship I have the 3 large ships of the Lego Classic era: 6985 Cosmic Fleet Voyager, 6980 Galaxy Commander and 928 Galaxy Explorer(but I have the other two set since I was a kid).
The 3 sets are very different; it is difficult to say which one is better.
This set is very big, and the space lap and main part of the ship are very cool, also the colour scheme (white and blue) is excellent.
It has a lot of interior space for the buggy and the minifigures, I think one can fit almost 10 minifigures inside.
It is one of the only set with 4 different colour classic space minifigures (White, Black, Yellow and Red).
Also mi first Red classic space minifigure.
Overall a big 5 as the Galaxy Commander and Galaxy Explorer

A candidate for best Lego spaceship ever, it really looks as though it's made for long-distance voyages.  A corridor leads from the cockpit to the stern, and the stern can be removed to form a ground base.  There are lots of little details such as equipment-carriers which can be removed from the stern and fitted onto a little moon rover.  I still remember buying this in a department store for Â£14 (it must have been on special offer, was a bigger Lego set than the ones I could usually afford) in 1987 (an unforgettable year for me as far as Lego Space was concerned).  The alternative building possibilities of this set are endless.  I even built it into a Quark robot from Dr Who.

I have always liked the break off section in the lab, but what really impresses me with this one is the amount of space in them middle sections.  Would have liked to have seen some thrusters on the bottom of the ship.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jack75","2009-05-13T17:36:41.92Z","Classic Dreadnaught","There's so much to say about this set. First of all, I got this off eBay for a bargain price of $91. If I hadn't won the auction, I would have had to pay $130 for it off Bricklink. The ship itself is very good. It also has one of those 1x2 control panel pieces. The ship also has a door in the middle, but I found it to be pointless and took it out. It also has a lot of Trans-Yellow Pieces, which are very useful. My friend even made a pair of glasses out of the pieces! Unfortunatly, there has been a tradgedy with my spacemen. The red spaceman's airtanks are broken, although I intend on fixing it. The set also came with a small buggy to carry the tools. I also use it as a medical transport, for the forseeable future. The engine pieces on the wings are also very unique. Well, I hope this helps.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2010-01-25T14:28:34.39Z","Ugly on the Outside But Great Set","I think I was more used to expansive wing sets (like F-14s, X-Wings, etc.) that had an aesthetic appeal to me.  So when I first saw this set, my gut reaction (as a kid) was, ""eeek!""  But looking back, it's the grittiness of this set, the angled windows and corners that make it a uniquely designed set.  Oh, and did I mention how modular this set is?

For a large ship (at that time), the set is very sturdy.  It can split in two sections, with the rear becoming an exploratory type of base.  The little wheeled vehicle nicely fits into that compartment while two detachable sections of equipment are stored in the rear section.

I really liked how the set utilized the double canopy technique in the front section.  It gave the illusion that the set looked ""tall"", although you could get a guy to stand up in the rear.  I think at this point, most people were confined into sitting positions in many space ships, so that visual element signaled how big this set could be.  Another technique that I learned from this set was utilizing multiple connection pieces to ensure that both sections of the ship could securely be coupled together.  The rear section can be a bit weighty, so you needed the connector piece on top to reinforce the two sections being joined.

There's a lot of little details (for that period) on the set that add more realism. For instance, the usage of arrows, vents, grills, the space logo and hoses.  Also, the ship was pretty ""tight"" meaning that it had enclosed space, permitting the astronauts inside to take off their helmets (whereas some current sets show open areas during space flight).  I used to like combining this set with the Galaxy Commander because the color schemes were fairly close together and I could produce some wild, uber-huge ships.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rab1234","2018-07-09T21:24:40.553Z","Great classic space set despite BUSPS","<h2><strong>Building experience&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Part of my massive haul of 50+ sets&nbsp;for &lt;$300. &nbsp;Again my experience was rooting through a huge bin to find the right pieces so the build was spaced out over weeks, but always enjoyable. Nothing overly complicated so pretty standard build for the time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>The set does contain what I&rsquo;d refer to as BUSPS. Big ugly space pieces. &nbsp;The corners were particularly hard to use anywhere other than in the intended sets unless you&rsquo;re super creative. &nbsp;The double windows are again not easy to reuse. &nbsp;Other than those there are some good classic parts and the set somehow still manages to have over 400 parts despite the 10 or so BUSPS &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Excellent playability. &nbsp;Swooshable&nbsp;and the modular design plus buggy lend themselves to hours of fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Value for the money</h2>

<p>The set is a collectors item now so definitely worth the expense back in the day. &nbsp;I suppose the current value is in the eye of the beholder though.&nbsp;</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-08-10T05:34:04.02Z","Classic Space at its best","<p>As a kid it was always the space sets that were my favorite to play with, and they made up the largest part of my Lego collection. Of the 10 sets I had (still have) this one is the biggest and the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It truly is a massive spaceship. While other Classic Space sets may be long, they were typically very skinny, but not this one. While it does taper towards the front, the front still has a lot of bulk. The set also includes numerous special pieces that are unique to Classic Space with the space frame like corner pieces unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for playability, the ship can separate into 2 parts with the front part becoming a smaller space ship and the back becoming a landing module which holds a small rover. It also features plenty of moving parts so you can access the entire interior and lock the rover while in flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t exactly the strongest structure, and may break while playing with it, but typically can be repaired very easily. It is definitely a very fun build and more complex than most Classic Space sets &nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course all of my space sets are mixed up, but I see here that it comes with 4 different colored astronauts but no robots. It&rsquo;s really a shame there are no robots because Classic Space robots are very cool, but hopefully you have some from other Classic Space sets, if not they are easy to build from spare parts.</p>

<p>But there is no doubt in my mind that this is the crown jewel of Classic Space, and possibly&nbsp;even the best set from the 80&rsquo;s, although King&rsquo;s Castle (6080) is hard to beat. I really hope you had this as a kid, but if you didn&rsquo;t, perhaps you should consider buying it now.&nbsp;</p>
