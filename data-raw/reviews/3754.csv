"SweetBoy","2005-08-04T07:49:44Z","Bulky and Flawed","The largest of the original Space Police series this set held much promise. It holds two cells instead of the usual one, two of the great policeman minifigures with their red visors and a single Blacktron I figure. These minifigures may some of the most fun ever produced by Lego but this set fails to do them justice. The other sets in this range were innovative and compact. This one is big for the sake of it.  The nose opens like a cargo plane which is fun but the main body is bulky and empty, the detatchable rear section is again overlarge and very limited in playability.  Lacking the spark of the smaller sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"einsteinonthebeach","2008-02-09T17:24:09.06Z","Sleek ship with a poor use of space","Having just bought the Mission Commander from Bricklink for a hefty price, I must say that I am slightly disappointed.

The overall design looks sleek and intimidating, but upon closer inspection, the majority of the ship is empty.  The function of having the front cockpit tilt up to reveal a land rover is very cool, but it takes up about 50% of the ship.  There could have been many other interesting uses for the front of the ship.  It feels like a waste of space.

The back of the ship gets better in terms of use of space but still has flaws.  There is a detachable part of the ship that houses the two Space Lock-Up units, a couple of lasers and two trans-red shields that house small hover-crafts.  The ability to detach the back section of the ship is nice.  However, the space is completley empty.  A computer, walkie-talkies and some guns, tools would have really helped fill in the space and add playability.  

Overall the ship is quite nice, with some well thought out (although space consuming) functions.  The amazing color scheme and ingenious design of the Space Lock-Up units help raise the rating from 3 to 4.  I would recommend picking up this classic space set only if you can find it under $100.00.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dim","2008-08-24T14:24:46.67Z","My favorite Lego Space set","I guess this set is not everybody's cup of tea but I still think of it as the best Space set ever. I recognize the space usage issues that many have commented on and the complete lack of controls, but I think the innovative functions of this set were of a higher priority in the maker's mind rather than producing another spacious vehicle (like it's predecessor, the 6985)
The design is sleek and aggressive, whereas the cockpit lift kinematics and the overall 'naked' look have a strong 'Technic' flavour, as if a Technic designer got involved in the making of this set. This is also true for other SP1 sets. But the way that the aforementioned mechanism lifts up the (prison cell transporting) buggy, plus the clever way that the rear section locks without the need of pins and the cleverly integrated escape pods are all unique to this set. A true flagship",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"speed27","2008-06-15T00:27:09.09Z","Good Set to customise","i just got this on ebay (AU$100) with instructions which is pricey but this is a rarer set in oz anyway. it is a bit on the sparse side but this is what lego is all about. start with something and make it your own. so below is a list of mods to make it a bit more special.
COCKPIT
now controling the ship from the car controls is not on. so the tilt up cockpit section scored part 2342 (Minifig, Utensil Control Panel in blue) plus 3069bp25 X2 (Blue Tile, Decorated 1 x 2 with Computer Pattern) and a computer screen 3039p34 (Blue Slope, Decorated 45 2 x 2 with Computer Panel Pattern). i also repositioned the 2x1 black plates to seal the cockpit. now we have flight controls for this monster. i also added a ramp for the car using 4213 (Black Hinge Car Roof 4 x 4) and 4315(black Hinge Car Roof Holder 1 x 4). from the front it blends in but sort of stands out from the side.
ENGINES
so what propels this ship? well if you switch the 4x4 wings from side to side at the back you can mount 4746 (Black Tail 4 x 2 x 2, Rocket) with 4591 (black Brick, Round 2 x 2 x 2 with Fins) and now you have some go go for it.
REAR SECTION
the roof 4x10 is now 6x10 with an additional rear section to seal it up. also it gets two computer screens and a chair for the man in the back to watch the blacktrons. i have also added a ground vehicle or a small winged craft (complete with folding wings!) that slots in the rear section. the radar dish also scored a turntable.

these mods seem to complete it for me. i also added a blacktron figure to the other cell and a space police figure in the rear section.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BobaFett2","2010-08-24T17:20:39.06Z","A Highly Underrated Set-One of the Best Spaceships Around","I find that many newer sets are way overrated, while many older ones are underrated. This is one of those older ones that just isn't as popular as it would seem. The set itself is great, and is amazingly thoughtful. It has a lot of little features not usually seen in other sets.<br><br>I bought this set on bricklink for 100 dollars- It was well worth it, as it outclasses most ships around in many ways. The cockpit mechanism is great-with the opening bottom, and the car inside. The wings both has large trans red parts under which are twin vehicles (quite cool actually), and the back part detaches, forming a landing base. The color scheme is one of the best ever, and it's got some great parts.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Building the set was a lot of fun, with wierd and interesting techniques plus a lot of cool parts to use.

"ra226","2014-10-06T07:53:35.96Z","Still fun, still mean-lookin'--a Classic!","<p>Blacktron&nbsp;is a fan favorite Space theme (and my own as well!), but it left us with a bit of a problem--who&#39;s going to take care of these bad guys??? &nbsp;Enter the original Space Police theme of 1989. &nbsp;And this ship, the Mission Commander, was the capital ship of its day, an awesome ship then and now. &nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">And it&#39;s as mean a</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">s ever, too.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This one is a&nbsp;lot of fun to build--even by just a few steps in, you can tell just from the skeleton form that this is going to be a cool looking ship.</span>&nbsp; The end result is a&nbsp;ship which comes apart into seven pieces: the main ship, the cargo bay, a flat bed transport truck, two modular prison cells, and two small, personal&nbsp;transports. &nbsp;And of course, all the parts come together in some rather clever ways. &nbsp;The prison cells mount in the cargo bay in typical horizontal fashion. &nbsp;The small flyers mount under trans-red shielding on the wings and double for engines (while it may not&nbsp;make much practical sense, it&#39;s a very cool feature and one many kids will love). &nbsp;Turning a dial on the side of the craft opens the nose&nbsp;similar to a cargo plane, lifting up and allowing the truck to park via a neat mechanism that&nbsp;draws it in and&nbsp;locks it into position--thus the truck doubles as the pilot&#39;s seat.</p>

<p>The design is well suited to its function. &nbsp;It&#39;s bristling with lasers, has a nice, big radar dish for (what else!) mission commanding, and comes with two prison cells--the only set in the lineup to have more than one. &nbsp;About the only issue (and unfortunately, it&#39;s a pretty serious one) is that there&#39;s not a single computer on board. &nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of room in the back and it&#39;s a shame there&#39;s not an entire bank of computer screens for coordinating, eavesdropping, etc (what&#39;s that radar dish connected to, anyway?).</p>

<p>The colors are standard Space Police and look good, with just the right blend of black, blue, and trans-red. SP1 was the last Space theme to use a more muted color scheme--starting with M:Tron in 1990, just about every space set had at least a few parts in the new&nbsp;neon&nbsp;colors.</p>

"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-12-15T13:54:31.04Z","‘Classic’ Spaceship comparison reviews.","<p>The <em>6986-Mission Commander</em> from the 1989 Space Police subtheme was the largest classic spaceship I owned. With 478 pieces its 54 studs long and 36 studs wide. <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49540""><em>70816-Benny&rsquo;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!</em></a> Has almost twice as many pieces, but is only slightly longer at 60 studs, and slightly wider at 44 studs, plus 8 more studs with the wings extended.</p>

<p>It almost exactly the same size as <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49542""><em>6973-Deep Freeze Defender</em> </a>which has slightly fewer pieces.</p>

<p>With only a 16 page instruction book one of which is the cover picture, the build is pretty quick (averaging over 30 pieces per page) the ship comes together pretty quickly. The colour scheme of Black, Bright Blue and Transparent Red looks really good, and the slightly open structure along the middle provides an easy handle with which to pick it up for swooshing. That said; the open structure also seems like a fair amount of wasted space compared to 70816 and other newer sets.</p>

<p>The rear cargo bay is pretty big; with the very useful curved black and blue wall sections it quickly builds to a good sized box. This holds the two prison cells (one of which is occupied by the Blacktron bad guy), and space for the second Space Policeman. Again it&rsquo;s lacking any details &ndash; another vehicle could be parked in here, or some consoles, controls and even a seat would make it an excellent control centre.</p>

<p>The cockpit opens up, and the pilot can drive out the transport vehicle, which can be used to transport the prison cells (presumably to a more permanent storage base). There are also 2 cool mini flyers under hinged transparent canopies, and the cargo bay is held into place by hinged plates locked in by fold down rudder pieces.</p>

<p>The spaceship looks really good, and is very swooshable, but the lack of extra detail, particularly in the cargo bay does hurt it in comparison to 70816, and even 6973 which has a little more to each of the sections.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-27T22:01:53.01Z","Mighty Space Police","<p>Building this model was interesting, though slightly frustrating.</p>

<p>The structure is almost dominated by the mechanism to the make the front of the ship open and disgorge a small buggy. Consequently, there is minimal room inside compared to either the Space Police 2 or 3 equivalent models. It is very light for it&#39;s size.</p>

<p>There are some interesting parts included that will be very useful in further builds.</p>

<p>The build is very swooshable even with the weight of all the small ships and the jail cells attached. Once on the ground, there is ample room for the Mission Commander to act as a base whilst Space Police Officers go about the business of making arrests and opposing criminals. It is satisfying to look at once made.</p>

<p>The moving parts add nicely to the opportunities for narrative.</p>

<p>Overall, I love this model. I am lucky enough to have the SP2 and SP3 equivalents. They are all great fun, but this one will always have a place in my heart!</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Looks good</p>
