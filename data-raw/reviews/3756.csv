"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T06:20:26Z","A must have for any Blacktron fan!","One of only two Blacktron 2 sets I own, but definitely one of the best in my opinion. At around &#163;40/&#163;50 when it first came out, it is a great resource for an array of bricks and detailed building plates.
The ship is larger than it appears to be and the &quot;pod&quot; is detatchable. The rear of the ship features hinge bricks and a platform, allowing it to be opened. You'll find that the small buggy that complements the set fits snugly in there. A flag piece also supports the &quot;lock&quot;, ensuring that the buggy will not fall out if the hinge bricks have slackened over time.
The base itself stands tall and features a docking bay for another “pod”, which incidentally is very similar to the two included in set 6981, which along with more baseplates, you could expand this base to coincide with the rest of the range. The base also sports a prison cell, with a rare stair piece connecting the two levels and a concealed battery box to support the light system.
Definitely a must have set for any Blacktron or classic space fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zzoreil","2006-11-17T06:43:36Z","awesome set!","An other great set. The base itself is good with the electric system and the land pad. But i like more the ship, wich is the descendant of the old 6931. Same structure, with a buggy in the rear compartiment.
Lego definitely use the design of these cool cockpits at their best.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-09T14:57:37.077Z","Great spacecraft.","The spacecraft is great, has an interesting, unusual design and even a spare cockpit detachable from the base.  The ship has its own landing pad, which also looks good.  The main problem I have is with the base itself.  I understand that there's no way anyone could hope to compete with the first Blacktron base, but this second base is far too open and skimpy-looking.  The lights just seem as though they were put in as an afterthought.  Perhaps a better way of putting the price up would be to have made a more fleshed-out base.  Still, worth getting for that fantastic spacecraft.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"dim","2010-03-15T16:38:54.967Z","Good looking but with limited playability","<p>This set&nbsp;was a direct replacement of the fantastic 6987 - <em>Message Intercept Base</em> and it had a lot to live up to. To my opinion it is a decent set but it cannot compete with its predecessor. </p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The base:</em> This set is built traditionally on two base plates, but here the main one is a raised base plate (which was new to space at that time) and the second is a landing pad. The base itself is largely devoid of any function; it seems to be primarily&nbsp;a maintenance outpost for the spaceship that comes along. The recess in the middle of the raised base plate features a staircase and is covered by a hatch creating something like a prison cell, but mainly it serves as the hiding place of the battery pack for the lighting system. In front of the base there is an attachment point of a spare cockpit for the spaceship. The lighting system is&nbsp;placed behind the huge transparent panels that form the main bulk of the base.</li>
<li><em>The spaceship:</em> The spaceship is fairly large for a secondary vehicle and it looks like a reinterpretation of the 6931 - <em>FX Star Patroller</em>, particularly the aft section. The cockpit is almost identical to any other Blacktron II cockpit. The small rover can find its place in the cargo area of the spaceship.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The spaceship is fairly large and it could make a set on its own. The&nbsp;bulbous transparent cockpit&nbsp;is a great design, the best idea in the entire Blacktron II series.</li>
<li>The base is fairly good looking and it looks again very futuristic.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The building experience is not very satisfying; one feels that most of the time they decorate the raised base plate with&nbsp;parts and bricks&nbsp;here and there rather than building an organic structure. This is because of the fact that this base plate makes more than 50% of the bulk. Therefore the piece count is also much lower than other similarly large sets.</li>
<li>This raised base plate, apart from reducing the building experience, looks also very&nbsp;'juniorized' and together with the Blacktron II colours the entire set looks much more toyish than the original Blacktron base.</li>
<li>This set is almost devoid of interesting functions or building techniques. There are no movable parts on the base. Furthermore I think that the spare cockpit could have a different design to enhance playability by changing the look of the spaceship once attached to it. The base is also completely open with no defined enclosed areas (apart from the cellar). The lighting system was in the end a necessity to add&nbsp;some interest to the whole.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The spaceship has no connection to the base, it just stands next to it. Boring!</li></ul>
<p>Summing up, interesting design but functionally it doesn't live up to the task of replacing successfully its predecessor.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3
"zinkk757","2007-07-24T18:45:36.427Z","4/5 a true space set","this set is a decent example of the old days where space series were abundent and not so hard to get.  I got this set on ebay for 85 dollars along with 3 other blacktron 2 sets.  I think that the ship is great and the pod is pretty cool, but why is it wher it is?  the lights are ok but not in the right place.  if their should be lights at all, then at least conceal them behind the two green plates.  5 figures is an awesome bonus to this set.  unlike some other space sets, this one has a landing pad connected to it, making it extra cool, and on top of that, it has its own little transport ship also.  overall, it's a great set and worth buying any time.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-20T15:59:19.45Z","Great design but a little crowded.","The design of the base is great, with the landing pad, and the rover and all, but this set is a base, and we buy bases for just that, the base. The base is a little crowded, yes the modules all around it are cool, and the lights are awesome, and even the staircase into the basement is nice,  but what else? No control panels, no security (even the Ice Planet base looks tougher than this, even it has a GATE at least. I can just imagine the space police just waltzing up to the ramp flashing a badge and yelling &quot;you're all under arrest!&quot; and all that can stop it is a nearly harmless carrier, a rover and five men, PUH-LEASE... Oh well, otherwise great. The pros to this set are that the ship it does include is cool, and has an amazing cargo hold with the old fashioned swinging doors, but there's a twist, there is also a cargo box and a ramp! A few slight modifications and this could have been a 4. If you find a good price buy it (I got mine used for $40).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
