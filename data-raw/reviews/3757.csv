"A_Brickset_user","2000-06-24T00:00:00Z","","This was a lesson in not judging a lego set by its catalogue photo.  Before I bought this I thought it was just a few big pieces and a crane on wheels, but when I got it I was amazed at all its features.  There is a storage compartment in the back for containing a small buggy and two little spaceships, the crane is fully moveable and there are enough pieces for all kinds of alternative building possibilities.  The transparent neon yellow/green pieces and the magnets were an original touch, its nice to see a new colour scheme (red), the huge vehicle is fully articulated and the driving cockpit with its ascending pilot seats looks terrific.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-10T02:32:49Z","wow.","when building a large set, its really easy to get disappointed in the size of the end product... it always looks so big in picture doesnt it? Well the mega core is an exception. not only is it huge, but has loads of features and is amazingly solid. the windshield might be a little shakey, but the chassis is tough as hell. in fact it was downright hard to take apart! in catalogue pix, the vehicle looks like just a set of wheels but really is loaded with features.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I have to say I'm mostly disappointed by the models on the back of the box, it's a clear indication that by the time M-Tron had came out, lego space was basically dead.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The amazing features are the huge wheels and huge window screen which when I first saw in Red Balloon toy shop when I was 9 I just knew I had to have, Which of course I did and got all the rest of the models in in M-Tron range.Classic lego that I will never forget, just wish lego will go back to basics and do away with some of their recent ranges for classics like these!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-22T20:49:37.153Z","A real titan.","This was a bold attempt to make a giant ground vehicle, and it was in my humble opinion a great success.  It is hinged and so can be moved all around your living room/bedroom/garden.  It comes with a crane, various equipment and containers, two buggies and a small spacecraft.  The magnets are a good idea, and the front of the vehicle, with its unusual use of a quarter-dome and its ascending drivers' seats, is a classic piece of designing.

"nateholio","2009-08-10T12:43:33.437Z","Mega Core is Mega Fun","I remember having this set as a kid (and losing most of the parts like a dummy as a kid), and just recently purchased another.

Usually I just assemble the older sets I buy then shelve them for display, but this one was an exception - I forgot how neat it was! This set acts as M-Tron's mobile mining ""base"", and ties the rest of the M-Tron sets together, giving each a specific purpose in M-Tron's quest for the trans-neon green nodules.

Pros:
-Lots of neat tools to use for mining and making repairs in the field
-Two rovers and a flying scout craft for getting to mining sites where the main vehicle can't get close to
-Cool looking cockpit area with ""theater seating"" for three
-Huge trans-neon green windscreen that looks awesome
-Too many other pros to list here

Cons:
-Area between the middle axle could have been made useful instead of just being dead space
-Why would a a ground vehicle need rocket engines?

Too bad Lego makes bland, poopy space sets nowadays instead of sets like this with tons of function and great looks that capture the imagination.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"James83","2017-08-02T15:09:07.7Z","M-Tron Masterpiece","<p>This set is perhaps the one of the finest Lego Space vehicles ever made and certainly the best M-Tron&nbsp;set and made a very fine Christmas present too!</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The Mobile Recovery Centre a massive, not many vehicles were ever big enough to dwarf the minifigures&nbsp;but this six-wheeled go-anywhere monster really had presence. The styling is perfect, the red and black M-Tron&nbsp;colour scheme always looked good, although I was never entirely taken with the luminous green antennas and cones but the green dome section used as a giant windscreen/canopy gives a futuristic look which no other Space set could easily match. It is also a challenging build.</p>

<p>The vehicle is essentially three parts; cockpit, cargo section and mini-vehicle carrier/crane. The cockpit is roomy and sits all three mini-figures&nbsp;in a tiered arrangement, the driver having two sticks to steer with and the other two having a computer brick and vent brick beside their seats. The small barrier pieces beside the seats could also double as a handy too storage area. The cockpit is topped by the green canopy, my only grip being that the attachment to the back of the 2x2 turntable was too weak and often the screen would fall off and getting back into place wasn&#39;t easy.</p>

<p>The cargo area contains two areas for the pods and a tilting&nbsp;and turning antenna which doubled as a lock for the canopy to keep it in place when traversing rough terrain. This seems a rather complicated and unnecessary feature.&nbsp;Each pod was equipped with a magnet and had two flip-up doors with a cool sci-fi printed pattern. One pod was for cargo with two small 1x1 computer blocks as access panels. The other contained a large hose reel and two backpacks with hoses. What these were for I never worked out, unless the M-Tron&#39;s loved to wash their dirty vehicles often?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rear section, joined to the main section by two flexible joins was cleverly designed, the two mini-vehicles being held in pouches on either side and the mini-spacecraft in the rear hangar which featured a ramp door. The two-stage opening and closing process for the ramp was perhaps over-complicated but the two rocket nozzle handles looked cool. The magnetic crane was easy to use with a chunky tire button to adjust the reach and the whole crane&nbsp;tilted downwards using two 4x4 hinge bricks underneath the turntable. This was generally sturdy but sometimes the entire crane would come loose. I would have liked an operator station on the crane but it did have a radar on the roof, though the green cones were probably unnecessary decoration.&nbsp;I loved the fact you had not only two pods but three mini-vehicles to use with the crane and it really made the set feel a complete package. There was no research or reconnaissance mission you couldn&#39;t accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Three standard M-Tron&nbsp;figures with airtanks. All have&nbsp;a place to sit and each has&nbsp;an individual vehicle, so everyone is kept busy.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I had hours of fun with this set and it was a perfect M-Tron&nbsp;mobile base. I never broke down the pods and they had a long life with numerous other Space sets and own-built craft. However many parts of this set are bespoke and hard to fit into other own-built creations. The huge wheels are hard to use on another vehicle and while the green canopy made an excellent dome for other space stations it didn&#39;t really fit anything else unless you were building something M-Tron&nbsp;or Blacktron related. However, given this vehicle was so well designed and innovative its a must have for any M-Tron fan.</p>

"Faefrost","2014-09-14T23:35:17.217Z","The very definition of Awesome","<p>One of the best most mind blowingly&nbsp;awesome sets Lego has ever produced. One that burns its way into your brain and leaves a lasting impression. Legos first &nbsp;ground vehicle space flagship set is truly something to behold. And stands up really well over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It stands out as one of the larger system scale trucks ever. Moving along on 3 pairs of&nbsp;massive classic space wheels. The whole thing is hinged midship&nbsp;and gas a really neat HoG steering mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The colors are truly striking. Mtrons&nbsp;classic Red and Black (and really the vast bulk of the parts in this set are red or black, with only a small handful of light gray detail parts) &nbsp;ex entitled by what has to be the most amazing canopy Lego has come up with. A trans nean green quarter dome shifted sideways. It just glows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rear of the ship is dominated by a massive cargo crane with the chief Mtron functionality, a magnet. The crane is a little strange, but can move cargo to and from all lock downs to the ground. Also included and docked within the monster are 1 small cargo pod, 2 large cargo pods with different loads, 2 wheeled rovers and 1 hover scout. All with magnets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are 3 standard smiley face Mtrons. All three can sit in the front cockpit in line. Praying that they don&#39;t get sucked into the wheels. ( this thing could really use some sort of fender between the wheels and the cockpit.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>the he only complaint is minor. They used some rather innovative techniques for the time, to flip the dome to be the canopy. It is not a 100% perfect solution as the canopy has a lot of free wiggle. Plus opening the canopy, while hinged, involves moving a lot of stuff out of the way.</p>

<p>Overall one of the finest creations in the Lego Space theme. Easily near the top of the all time best Space sets ever. Sadly these can be pricey to find these days as the command good (well deserved) money these days. Keep scouring Bricklink and eBay for a good deal. This one is worth it.</p>

"doghead13","2013-05-02T15:41:47.373Z","A masterpiece of the set-designers' art.","<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Looking back, I think as a child –
and, now, as a 'born-again' AFOL – the greatest measure of a Lego
set is, how often did you tear apart dozens of MOCs to rebuild<i> that
one set</i> again?</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Most sets you'd only build once or
twice before it all got swept up into the general collection of Lego
and forgotten about, to the point that some sets you just bought for
the parts, you maybe bought several of the same set just because it was a cheap way to get a bunch of this useful part.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Not set 6989 though. <i>Never </i>6989. With that one set, parts were secondary to everything; again and again me and my brother tore apart dozens of other builds
to salvage the parts to put this beast back together – maybe as
much as three dozen times over a period of about a decade, vastly
outweighing even the favourites of our other sets – and each time we
found ourselves reminded that, no, we were <i>not </i>imagining it, the
six-wheeled juggernaut we dubbed 'The Crawler' (with an emphasis on
the 'The') really <b>was </b><i>that awesome</i>.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">To the point that every other use we came up with for the windscreen and the six wheels was regarded in reference to 'time until we rebuild The Crawler'.<br></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><br></p>What criticisms can I come up with... It could have done with some sort of mudguards between the front wheels and the cab seats cos it seemed a bit odd that those huge tyres were whirling away right next to the driver's figurative ears? Motorisation would have been nice? A few extra Technic connectors fitted inboard of the tyres would've made them less likely to pop off their hubs when navigating challenging terrain? Some reinforcement to the attachments for the windscreen would be good as it was prone to shear away during heavy front-end collisions; a few fiddly little details really, none of them detracting from the fact that this is my favourite-ever set and would take a great deal of beating.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
