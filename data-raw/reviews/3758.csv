"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T10:02:44Z","The Ultimate....","I remember getting this set and thinking it was Christmas. Oh, wait, it was! My parents must have saved for 4 months just to be able to afford it at the time. In my opinion, the greatest ever space set and indeed one of the greatest ever lego sets. There's something about the large blue transparent pieces that makes you feel like you're in space.... I used to wear the curved rectangular one as a visor and pretend I was a futuron dude.

The pinnacle of lego space sets, before they started getting too themed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-01T10:38:19Z","Best Monorail, but could use more track","  I got this set as a Christmas present, MIB!  I am really impressed with it.  The train is very elegant and the stations are very futuristic looking.  The domed building opens and you can move around the cargo containers from engine to engine and onto both stations. In addition the light has two patterns, a blinking light and a strobe.  Cool!  
  I only have one complaint, (you're thinking, that'll be the day) is that there were no switching rails and the basic oval is a bit boring after a while.  I would have liked for much more complicated track layout, such as the Airport Shuttle or Monorail Transport Base layouts. The bonus track set only had curved and straight.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-03T06:47:36Z","Finally got one","An amazing set. The colours are amazing and it really looks the part. 

Having finally managed to obtain this set through Ebay I was mighty pleased to see that that it came with the extension track. So now I can have a monster layout linking it with 6991. It even came with some additional lights and a couple of sirens!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T09:56:56Z","Problems...","Has anybody else tried running 6990 and 6991 running on the same layout? If you haven't be aware that 6990 can not run through the 6991 base/centre because of the rotating wheel that makes the satelite dish spin. Its really annoying. 

However, once both are set and running on the same layout its great. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"frechling","2010-08-24T16:20:56.637Z","Simply great!","<p>I was around eleven years old, when this set appeared under the christmas tree, and I loved it from the first moment. Hours after hours I spent lying on grandma's carpet, under the table of the living room, hidden by a table cloth and watched the lights going round and round through the dark. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both space-stations are very well designed, especially the one with the two large spheres. Its ability to change shapes is very fascinating and inspiring. The track-layout could be more interesting and variable, but does the job.&nbsp;The train itself is very nice and functions perfectly, speacially the cargos and the motor part work well, the cockpits are standard, but thats absolutly no flaw. The suits of the Spaceman really fit in, colours are superb, maybe a black one could have been inside the set. The small vehicle for transporting the cargo is simple but not bad. And not to forget, those antenna things among the track, which tent to break but give the track a more ""spacy"" feeling. Like them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall rating:</strong> definitely a 5/5, so much fun, so many memories, still have the box, every christmas the set has a comeback on my floor ;) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building&nbsp;experience:</strong> Its pure fun when building this set, no repetitions at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong> In that times, those parts very absolutly fantastic for me, especially those huge transparent spheres. Many of my own creations based on them. Nice colour-sheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong> What can I say? I don' t think, there could be more fun in one set. And as a space-fan, it makes my heart beat faster only when looking at a foto of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value for money:</strong> Hmm, I got it as a present over 20 years ago, so cannot really comment on that.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"BigMac","2010-01-08T22:25:16.31Z","Its a big space base.","During the Christmas break, I designed a three level monorail track with 6990, 6991 and 6921 ( tracks only), could be several extra track pieces also. I run both trains of 6990 and 6991 on these over this 13 m long and three level  track system. I also added several big sets of Mars Theme to make these a true space city, which occupied an area of about 2.5mx3.0m. Great fun!!

Come back to mention something about 6990. The train design was much better than 6991.  The white and blue color of the train and stations matches perfectly. The stations look great, the movable platform , the extentable antenna and the very cute cargo shuttle make this a very detailed and playable set. However, the only con to this set is that it did not have any track exchange like that of 6991. I have only two track exchange from 6991, which limited the flexibility to design different track system. Of course this drawback does not refuse a 5 star rating to 6990, as all the idea and all others of the set are just too perfect.

Actually, from my point of view, Lego's monorail system may not be the best but definitely is the most fun and playable set than all the other lego themes. However, there are only 3 lego monorail issued, they are 6399, 6990 and 6991, I bought 6991 more than 15 years ago. and recently through Ebay I bought 6990 and 6921, which cost me a fortune, anyway it is worth to expand my monrail collection with $230.00. It is too expensive to buy 6399 it costs over $500.00 plus another $50.00 to post this from overseas, cannot afford.

I really hope that Lego would issue new monorail sytems again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"speed27","2012-04-28T21:40:22.137Z","True classic","I got my set from an eBay seller without having to go through an auction. I won't say how much I paid cause I got it for a steal. It came with both the monorail expansion tracks so it is massive. I plan to have it run around my space setup (three 928s, two 924s, two beta one base, rocket launch, blacktron base etc etc). The set itself is simple enough. The direction change that is activated by the track is clever so you can have an open track with the direction change at each end. With a few spares (blue battery box, trans yellow canopies) it is easy to change the colour scheme to classic space. If you come across a working one get it you won't be disappointed.<div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Citizen_Piper","2011-09-03T17:56:47.053Z","runs like a dream 20 years after","I had to cut open my bamboo piggy bank to buy the space monorail...it was the biggest and most expensive Lego set at that time. I was so proud to carry that big box out of the store...and, until now, it still makes me smile every time I remember that day.<br><br>This set has a generous serving of bricks and elements put together in a ""simple"" way. None of those sideways building or half step elements that we see today. It was straight-forward mechanical building where each part simply did what they had to do. The train itself is 4 studs wide added with ""lasers"" on the side that gave an additional 2 studs. It is more of a utilitarian-cargo loading train rather than the passenger type--emphasis given on the cargo container could be noted on the functionality of both stations.<br><br>The stations are exceptionally big and well crafted where on the ""first"" station, the monorail comes in on the upper level. It is greeted by a hand cranked cargo lift which also moves up and down a communications dish. <br><br>Second stop would be ground level where the station itself ""moves forward"" to bring the cargo loading platform closer to the train. It is so cleverly designed that you wouldn't figure out that it actually moves until you're done building. It was a smart way of putting rotating pieces and smooth tiles together. This is where a small cargo-loading craft comes to park/land to pick up its next load.<br><br>This set comes with an oval track, half ground level and half elevated, with two stations, and five minifigures. This is the batch of minifigures where the helmet-with-visor replaced the open-type helmet--things started to look the way they do today.<br><br>More than 20 years have passed since I bought this set and yet it runs just like the way it did in 1989. Just pop-in a new 9V battery and it hums (and lights up) along its trusty tracks.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Lego7755Fan2","2011-05-12T22:36:41.14Z","The Monorail That started it all!","This Monorail started the whole monorail saga. There was 3 trains, and this one ranks #2, followed by the 6991 at #3. This monorail had lights and interchangable containers, the battery box is the same size so it can change cars or go onto the vehicle transport. The shape of the monorail ends is awesome because of the little parts that stick out on the side. The make the model a total 2 studs wider! The lasers are a great addition to. The little craft that fits into one of the cars is a small but cool detail. The space stations like great with the large glass sections. There even in a spacey blue color. The Arieal antenna in trans dark blue was exclusive to the set. The antennas along the track are a great detail. If you can find one, buy it!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"Gridley","2013-08-29T00:38:31.983Z","Wonderful set, years of playing","This was an amazing set. I rebuilt it hundreds of times, played with it for years. The track was fairly short, but running it as a point-to-point instead of a loop worked too. Combined well with other space sets as a centerpiece.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"naf","2013-06-11T13:13:52.96Z","Still great 20+ years later!","<p>Space was my favorite theme in the 80's. &nbsp;After collecting classic space for most of my early childhood, I fell in love the Futuron theme at first sight. &nbsp;The color scheme was fresh and different, and the new minifigures looked awesome with their blue visors and printed space suits. &nbsp;I think I started begging my parents for the Monorail Transport System in July, and finally had it in my hands next Christmas morning.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The art on the box is great. &nbsp;It shows the actual set on some distant planet, with stars and a grid of lasers in the background. &nbsp;The inset shows the entire setup, along with an explanation of the 9v battery system. &nbsp;Like all classic boxes from the era, the top flap opens up to reveal the special parts included in the set, along with the minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions are well done and easy to follow. &nbsp;The last page of the instructions shows some alternate builds for the monorail.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Lots of nice trans blue parts give this set a great sci-fi look, especially the large quarter-dome pieces on the ground level base. Most of the set is built with basic bricks, and it still looks great even by today's standards.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Futuron minifigures, still some of my favorite minifigure desings. &nbsp;The simple diagonal zip-up spacesuit still looks great, and this is the first space theme to have helmets with visors.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>&nbsp;For such a large set, it comes together rather quickly. &nbsp;The ground level base is probably the trickiest part of the build, as you have to align pieces correctly on a large gray baseplate. &nbsp;A kid should have no trouble putting this together in a couple of hours.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>Simply fantastic. &nbsp;A fully functional space monorail and two bases in one set. &nbsp;Great play features without having to resort to silly things like flick-fire missiles. &nbsp;The train transports a crate of materials to the lower base, which opens up via a hand crank to accept the cargo. &nbsp;A smaller manned transport is included to take the crate off to it's final destination. &nbsp;The upper base includes several computer terminals, and a working lift to load more cargo onto the monorail. &nbsp;Radar dishes are attached to the side of the track to further flesh out the base.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>This is a great set, and if you can find out at a decent price I would definitely pick it up. &nbsp;I just dug this out and build it after sitting in the basement for the last 20 years. &nbsp;In terms of looks, it still competes with anything put out today, and runs like a top even after all these years. &nbsp;I can't wait to show it to my own kids. &nbsp;The only thing I wish it came with is more track, the simple oval gets monotonous after a while. &nbsp;It does include two hills, which make it a bit more interesting.</div><div><br></div><div>After seeing it set up again, my parents said that they almost didn't get this for me all those years ago, they didn't want to ""spoil"" me. &nbsp;I'm so glad they decided otherwise, and I still came out alright ;)</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are nicely laid out, though they are a case of spot the difference and don&#39;t have as many stages as the current sets would. This makes for a very satisfying build experience as a bit more work is involved with it.</p>

<p>As with all of the sets of this eera, simple and basic. The helmets gave way oh so easily.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very satisfying and a whole lot of fun, even nearly thirty years on.</p>

"_Rpk74__Tamiyax","2014-08-31T01:20:29.737Z","The Famous Space Monorail","<p>I did a review on youtube:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ_jTBkckBY</p>

<p>I bought this set for 50&euro; in a car boot sale but&nbsp;unfortunately I don&#39;t have the box and the instructions! :(</p>

<p>When completed, I think it&#39;s a great set, because the track is really large, there are a lot of pieces, 5 minifigs, 2 bases and 2 vehicles</p>

<p>but let see the pros and cons!</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Large!!! more than 1 meter!</p>

<p>-2 bases, the&nbsp;main&nbsp;that has big windows, with a chair and mini computers, the second, with an elevator and two places with computers</p>

<p>-the train is fast, you can put 4 minifigs max in, the locomotive has the batteries&nbsp;but the other has a case</p>

<p>-a second vehicle, with a case</p>

<p>-5 minifigs! (2 different)</p>

<p>-2 speeds, reverse and forward</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-the&nbsp;main base was not interested to build... I think there was an error in the manual, for the part&nbsp;that moves... and difficult because you have to count the plots&nbsp;on the big plate</p>

<p>-difficult to assemble&nbsp;the rails too</p>

<p>-the car is ugly...</p>

<p>-when the train is working, it touch the&nbsp;decoration</p>

<p>_only&nbsp;3 accessories!! a&nbsp;talkie walkie, a wrench, a blaster</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has a good playability, but the parts&nbsp;that are moving in the principal base are useless, otherwise, it&#39;s one of the best set I have!</p>
