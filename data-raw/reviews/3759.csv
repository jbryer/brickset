"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-10T18:23:48Z","Jewel of the Unitron crown","This is by far and away the best Unitron set (granted, not a tough competition), no wonder it was the only one to be released world wide. The most obvious comparison to raise would be between this and its predecessor, the Space Trak Centre (6990). As far as the track goes this has more length, the benefit of points and more supports, but only the one long straight, and unfortunately it never had the support of an additional track set, something you really want with a set like this. One of the key points is the playability - the wheel set up which makes a radar assembly rotate as the train passes and most of all the systems which remove the detachable cockpits from the train, especially the lower station which also launches a vehicle into motion, great stuff. The base parts are adequate, nothing particularly special but good, solid construction all the same. On the down side, when the battery has run down a little the train can no longer get enough speed up on the hill for the automatic return mechanism to be effective. Also, the train's a little bland, obviously the battery has to take up a 4 by 8 space, but the pointless little thruster on the other car is just random and uninspired, there just to fill the space. It would be nice to see them do something more with the motor unit for a change too. I have a little thing about stickers, but there aren't many and they're fairly easy to place, so I'll let that slide. I don't think the price is valid grounds for complaint, it was at the time the biggest set around (and UK prices are much higher than US ones!). All in all it's a good set, but I'd prefer a Space Trak Centre (6990) if only for the far better designed, elegant looking and more functional train.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-01T00:40:52Z","surprise?","I actually prefer this to the 6990. This is mainly due to the color scheme, futuron looks nice but it did always had the feel of being classic space's poor cousin. This is different and unique, I'd love to give it a 10 but I'm not overly keen on the giant molded baseplate and stickers do annoy me, and if they get worn they are such a pain to replace. Anyway, it's like having a train set but without having to admit to being a train freak (just kidding, you train lovers out there!).
This would make a nice legend as opposed to classic space which would have all those new grey problems.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-10T07:30:29Z","Not classic space but still good! ","I also prefer this one to the 6990 monorail, but for a reason other than the colour scheme: 2 switching rails!! These are essential to build monorail tracks inside of tracks!!

I also like the tall raised platform on this set, it would make a wonderful space station with a few modifications!

Great selection of space parts, big window things, and cool figs. the part where the cockpit of the onorail detatches and goes onto the vehicle is kinda pointless because this is space, things fly not that. the monorail track selection is good, exept only one long strait. very good overall and cant appriciat it untill you get it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-26T16:15:41Z","my first and only monorail...","this is the seconed best monorail in my opinion(6399,6991,6990)This set has a cool land vehicle and the best bases of all the monorails. And a huge box. There are black baseplates and lots of buildiing possobilities. There is one bad thing, though. Only 1 long strait rail. O well, nothing bricklink and some extra cash couldnt fix. Its very much worth the money and can also get it pretty cheap on ebay.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T12:07:35.817Z","Union Station","This is the only Unitron set that's available outside of the US.  The other 3 Unitron sets - the land vehicle, the space hawk and the space station is US only.  This isn't the first monorail, nor is it the first space monorail, but it is the first with some interesting architecture.

The main thing is that the trains can take modular cockpits from any of the 4 Unitron sets and it will run happily and function with the reast of the special features of the set.  The midpoint station has a radar that rotates when the train passes through, and a rotating landing pad for the cockpits.  The tower, besides housing the control station behind glass windows, includes an automatic unloading facility for the train.  Likewise, the trains can also unload the cockpits automatically onto the rover vehicle at ground level.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lego4derek","2008-06-04T02:59:32.107Z","ASTRONOMICAL set","Wow I can't believe I finally have this set.  I bought it off bricklink about 2 weeks ago.  Sealed, box in excellent condition.  The colors of the windows fit perfectly with the other 3 unitron sets.  Space Station Zenon fits very nicely next door along with Crater Cruiser to go out and explore new terrain while Star Hawk 2 explores the space above.  Sorry imagination got carried away.  The most creative monorail track (other than the regular trains).  The Futuron rail is great as well but just like the old aiport monorail, its just an oval.  This layout consists of three levels, an internal oval on the second level and stopping points on the first and upper levels.  The flashing lights make another awesome space feature.  All in all, the set is just AMAZING.  Why has this not become a legend yet",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2009-08-18T23:56:16.733Z","I had to try to find cons!","For starters, I tried to find any possible flaw with the set's track and functions. The monorail track individually is flawless, the track itself is perfect. So to save time I'll split the review so you can decide what's worth reading.

Track system: Exactly the same as the futuron, airport and accessory track. No surprises there. BUT the track system as is is perfect. It consists of 9 basic pieces. I'll list them for you:
-Short Straight: 8 studs long
-Long Straight: 32 studs long
-Up ramp: 32 studs long, inclines track, required to level decline
-Down ramp: 32 studs long, declines track, required to level decline.
-Direction Switch: 16 studs long; stops, reverses, or continues motion with knob
-Large curve: 28x28 (?) curves track 90 degrees
-Track switcher left: Curves a track 45 degrees or stays straight
-Small curve left: completes a switcher (above)
-Track switcher right: Curves a track 45 degrees or stays straight
-Small curve right: completes a switcher (above)

The directional switch has an arrow conveniently pointing where the monorail will go. Also the switcher has a fail safe that resets the track should the train encounter a dead end.

Layout:

The overall layout of the track is somewhat simple, but uses what it has seamlessly. The layout is an oval design with two switches, each curving to the inside, one path curving up and the other curves down.

On the side is one base, a landing pad with a rotating elevator for the pilots. Here, you can change the direction, and the radar will rotate as the train passes. This is built on a ramp style baseplate and has a few radars and scanners.

On the downward slope is a dead end where the train must either automatically stop or reverse. When it does, the front cockpit will slide onto the included transport truck if it is in place.

On the top, the train will stop and release the back cockpit onto the pad above, please note this will reverse the engine. Underneath this is a small watchtower with a folding wall on the back. There are also two control panels inside. Behind this is a small radar.

Train and vehicles:

The train is a standard two sided model with the motor in the middle, and a battery box on one end. Unlike the futuron version, this one has no tool storage or tools for that matter. I'd also like a place to store the android other than seating him in a cockpit. Each cockpit is removable and lifts right off, it isn't even secured by any studs, so if you flip it upside-down, they will fall off. This isn't an issue since that is impossible, and this feature allows the cockpits, which double as unitron spaceships, to lift off onto the transport truck or the landing pad atop the watchtower.

The transport truck is perfectly sized for carrying one of the cockpits, and even has latches to hold it in place. Plus, the front is also a detachable hovership. The only thing I could want would be a small buggy for the ramp.

BONUS - the cockpit system will work with ANY of the unitron cockpits (1787, 1789, 1793). I've personally tested it, and I'd like to note the cockpit from 1787, the crater cruiser will not work unless the booster is removed.

Value: Overall, your getting a low part count, but a heavily modifiable track. This track system can be used with ANYTHING (even aquazone, I've seen it personally), so feel free to MoC your pants off. All in all, your getting a gigantic track system for a decent price. For the uses you'll get out of it, especially if your a train fan, space fan, or an MoC creator of either or both.
The best you'll get for this set now is about $200 US, so it is up to you...

Pros:
-Huge track
-Wonderful special features
-rotating radar
-Interchangeable cockpits
-Four figures
-Modifiable
-Three base plates
-Good motor
-Rotating elevator for pilots
-Cockpit release system
-Easy to control

Cons:
-Pricey
-Not as detailed as it could be
-No accessories
-Could use a little more... anything

Other than that, I'd recommend this to anyone, so long as you're fine paying the whopping price tag on it. Now, this much money will get you a remote controlled Emerald Night, but Emerald Night cant go uphill, doesn't have a station and won't turn into a spaceship. It's your choice...

I give it an 8.5/10, but I'll give it 5 stars since I'm a space fanatic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TheBrickGuru","2013-09-02T08:45:29.503Z","A Bit of a Disappointment... ","It was January of 1994 and I had just come in from a frigid sprint to the mailbox on a cold winter day to fetch the mail. &nbsp;The first Lego Shop at Home Catalogue of the year was in that days haul (this was back before the Internet so the quarterly catalogues were the first glimpses we would get of new sets). &nbsp;As I flipped longingly through the pages I came to the space theme section and was greeted by my first view of this massive sets. &nbsp;My little 9 year old heart skipped a beat and I knew: I. Must. Have. It. The problem, the price. &nbsp;$180 dollars (which is $280 in 2013 dollars when I am writing this review) was an insurmountable fortune for me. But two years later when I was lucky enough to win one of the contests they used to have in the Lego Mania Magazine made it became possible for this set to become mine. &nbsp;The night before it arrived I barely slept the anticipation was so high. &nbsp;But then I built it...&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Before I go on let me quickly say this, as a display piece this set is almost unequaled. &nbsp;Walking into whatever room it is displayed in and seeing it completely assembled is eye catching. &nbsp;The ramp baseplate which makes up the entire footprint of many sets from this era is but a tiny portion of this set and at isn't even the only base included. &nbsp;I also found the pieces to be fairly useful as a kid when I went to build MOCs, especially the many trans blue pieces. &nbsp;What then is this set's problem? Simple: playability. &nbsp;Lego did a fantastic job of making this set look impressive, but it is a veneer. &nbsp;The buildings are. Well. Empty on the inside, almost anemic. &nbsp;While it is cool that the monorail cars unload at the top and bottom of the ramps that feature doesn't really have a lot of play applications. &nbsp;At the end of the day it is just a base connected by train tracks. As a fan of Ice Planet at this same time I must confess that Ice Station Odyssey got as much if not more playtime than this set despite being much smaller simply because it had more playability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I just love Lego so there is no purchase or set I regret having, but there are some that I say if I had known then what I know now about the set I may have spent my money elsewhere. &nbsp;This set is near the top of that list. &nbsp;Lego roped me in with an eye popping display but under the veneer the sets appeal wore off pretty quick for me. &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,2
"Jay_Kenobi_ZX","2011-11-05T22:13:41.763Z","Best of the Classics","<p>I found this set while garage-sailing around the neighborhood, and got the entire thing for $5. Yeah, it's amazing (the deal and the set)</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>THE BOX IS HUUUGE! It has alot of nice pictures of the set from different angles and some other ways to build the set. The front of the box flips up to reveal more pictures, and some transparent wrapping exposes the pieces, nicely sorted in a plastic tray. The instructions are very clear and easy to read, also in the back are several different ways to arrange the tracks, which is very helpful and adds on to the playability and customization levels.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are many unique and different parts here that reflect the immanse creativity and quality of LEGO during the mid-90's. Lots of trans-blue elements, a lot of trans-green, and big supports for the tracks. The tracks themselves are nicely sized parts and fit together nicely. There isn't much of a variety in colors, though. But it does have a nice 'spacy' feel. There is also a nice elevated baseplate. I'd also like to add that there are a handful of stickers, but they are actually ok, and show very minor signs of losing their stickiness after almost 16 years (WOW).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>I got the set used from a garage sale, and it had all the minifigures but one, which was replaced by a classic pirate, and a Space Police (1995) minifigure as an added bonus. They have great detail (all of them really) and fit in with the set/theme nicely (except for the pirate guy)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build took me about an hour and a half, and I'm a very fast builder. Some of the parts were missing from mine (again a garage sale issue) so it took me a while to sort through my own collection for replacements. The build is fun, challenging, and engaging; I couldn't&nbsp; stop building!</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This thing is HUUGE, so build it near where you want it, because there's no lifting it. Just to give you an idea, the completed model takes up an entire table in my basement, which is a&nbsp;decent sized table that could seat up to 8 (real, not LEGO) people.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>If you have the chance to get this set, GET THIS SET! It is probably the best set of the 90's, and possibly one of the best sets ever. I've built this set 3 times, once before I moved, then in my bedroom (VERY BAD IDEA), and just today I rebuilt it in my basement as part of a base system for one of my full scale LEGO wars. It truly is an amazing set. If you can get it, get it. And enjoy. :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"elangab","2020-04-08T03:15:00.893Z","A review of this set, from the eyes of AFOL who never had it as a child","<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">I love Lego trains, had a lot of them as a child (12V), but never had a monorail. Just like most of us, I&#39;ve been hoping to own one as a child, dreaming of it while looking at the catalogue.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Fast-forward to 2020, and I manage to find a boxed used set for far below current market value price. This is important to note, as one can&#39;t ignore the fact it&#39;s a very pricey set on BL and eBay.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">After cleaning and sorting, testing and checking I built the whole set. It&#39;s indeed a very impressive set once built, as it&#39;s quite big and have lots of tracks.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Turning the monorail for the first time was exciting, and I was surprised to learn how fast does it move. It&#39;s a bit annoying to turn on and off but it moves nicely on the tracks. Sometimes it derails (when the monorail is without its &quot;heads&quot;/&quot;Space crafts&quot;), but all in all a very different experience to classic Lego trains.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">The switch section is really well-made, and the &quot;backwards&quot; feature is surprisingly working as it should :) There&#39;re no faults with the system itself.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">The other two features are the stations and monorail head auto-unloading.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">Both sides of the train can auto-unload into the launching pad and the space-vehicle. It&#39;s working as it should most of the time, and a really &quot;wow&quot; feature of the set.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">On the other hand, the stations are meh at best, which brings me to the main point - this set gets boring quite fast. There&#39;s not much to do with it, unless you have other space sets to play with. As a child, I would, but as AFOL, I mostly display and build &quot;real world&quot; city layouts. It&#39;s way too big to permanently display, and the buildings themselves are not that great to be honest. I don&#39;t have the nostalgic factor kicking in, so I just report what I see now.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">This was all great if the set was $250-$300, but it&#39;s not the case. I&#39;m happy with what I got for what I payed, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the $500+ asking price for it. There&#39;s just not much in it, other than the train itself and the tracks.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">I will convert the train to a MOC&nbsp;based on set #8404, and will use it as a light train for my city, but I don&#39;t see myself building the other section again, and will just store them.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">If you saw this set in real life, had it as a child or just an avid Lego Space collector - get it. If you never had it, I would suggest at least watching videos of it in order to learn more about what you get. If you find it for less than current used market value - it&#39;s a bargain, especially if you just need it for the motor/tracks/train base.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">I&#39;m happy that I own it, but can&#39;t wholeheartedly recommend it to as a blind-buy.</span></span></p>
