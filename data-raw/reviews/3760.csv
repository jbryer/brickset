Wasn't into the theme but picked it up at a discount, because a collector has a little of this and a little of that. I did have the mask but got rid of it(wish I had kept it now).  Has not been assembled in many years-doesn't really fit with LEGO town.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The transparent pieces are pretty cool but there are alot of them. The arms are wicked and great for abducting minifigs. 5 out of 5 for a detailed set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PepperPizzaMan2585","2009-11-03T21:12:12.577Z","WE COME IN PEACE!","This a very cool UFO set. It's a flying saucer that spins! The minifigure is also very cool. Also, the mask is cool and looks like it could fit anybody. Here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
Saucer
Alien
Can spin
Mask

Cons:
Is a little fragile",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

One thing i do not like about the UFO themed saucer plates is that it is difficult for the ship to take ""damage"" in combat... i guess that is good for the aliens!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
