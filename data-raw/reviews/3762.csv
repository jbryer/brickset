It comes with some nice head and tail pieces, it also comes with a scenery mat to play on (it is just printed to look like desert on the back of the instructions). It also comes with lots of black cones which are nice. Overall nice little set, and fun to play with, has a buch of nice pieces.

So I picked up the four cheaper and smaller sets, they were nice and all, but they weren't the same as those menacing looking canister sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Baby Ankylosaurus uses some oddly shaded pieces in its construction. These dinosaurs however didn't strike me as Babies, more like infants or smaller cousins perhaps to the larger canister models. The use of bricks in their construction of course limits their ability to strike any kind of pose, you could move the tail or the head and basically that was it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The models still achieved what they aimed for though. Imagination inspiration, you didn't need to build the models, you could take the pieces and make up any wild creatures you wanted. (Provided you had more than one.) I built some strange looking monstrosities once by combining all four of them into two seperate multi-headed creatures. It really looked creepy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say these are nice to have if you're looking for some different... not normally seen in those colors pieces. They'd be great for MOCing some stuff up, but they aren't must have hot ticket items. I donated mine away finally because they just didn't fit in anywhere with my other Themes and always looked out of place. But that of course is just me. Others may find these sets quite amusing and fun to look at.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
