It features simple and fast construction, but it has a tendency to cut a few corners... Also it doesn't resemble much the species it was aiming for, it looked more like another attempt at a Velociraptor first seen in the Raptor Rumble Studios set, only it didn't achieve its desired effect well either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set was cheap though and good for MOC parts, if you wanted some of those heads and things to build up your own wild and interesting looking creatures, that's why you picked these up. Putting those arms onto an older green dragon would have made for an interesting combination of colors I'm sure. (Not that I ever did that unfortunately.)</p>

<p>Overall you can easily skip this one if you aren't really into Dinosaurs made out of bricks.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
"drosteScincid","2011-06-27T02:23:59.813Z","Truncated Iguanodon","<p>I got this set a long time ago, and seeing that I like dinosaurs, I like it.</p>

<p>The overall look is pretty good if you take into consideration what they had to work with, as special body and limb pieces were only made for the bigger sets of the Dinosaurs theme. It&#39;s not completely accurate, but it does resemble a juvenile Iguanodon.</p>

<p>The pieces included are decent, with many sloped bricks in both light and dark gray. The set also includes several sand blue pieces, like the tail, arms and head. They could be used for MOCing.</p>

<p>The build is easy, I didn&#39;t have any problems with it back then.</p>

<p>The set has limited posability, with 6 single-axis joints. You can also reenact a Cretaceous hunt scene if you have a carnivorous dinosaur.</p>

<p>I recommend this to those who like dinosaurs and want a small set to prove it.</p>
