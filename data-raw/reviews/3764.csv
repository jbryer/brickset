Pros
-head
-neck
-tail (there are two tail pieces)
-Some good pieces (they have different pieces)

Cons:
-chunky body
-small
-legs don't move

But still a nice set, with good pieces.

(We'll get to the Dimetrodon problems in its review.) Baby Brachiosaurus and Ankylosaurus were the two best sets out of the group of four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brachiosaurus looks like a younger version of the larger canister Brachiosaurus, the colors even match. The build is fast and simple and fun, you can't move any of the limbs on this beastie, but you can turn the tail and the head, rotate them around I mean, the neck can be rotated to achieve various different angles for posing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say if you only get one of these sets it's a toss up between this one and the Ankylosaurus, but I like Brachiosaurs more than Ankylosaurs, so this one is one I would have kept if I hadn't decided to purge all four of them. Worth owning and recommended to fellow LEGO Dino enthusiasts.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5

<p>I think its even cuter than Duplo. This set does not come with much parts and its not much of a big building experience, thats why I rated this 4 bricks. I like how this comes with a play mat, it makes a good scene. This set is so easy to build that the instructions is&amp; one folded up piece of paper, the back is the play mat. I kinda like this theme more than Dino Attack.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
    <li>-Head</li>
    <li>-Play Mat</li>
    <li>-Tail</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
    <li>-Why does it look like he wears pants?</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this set is good, it only got 1 con, which is pretty good.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,5
