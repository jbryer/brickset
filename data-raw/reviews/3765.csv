It works well with the dinosaur sub-thme in the adventure theme and the pieces which are rare do like nice and are okay considering that there is still a lot of normal bricks and the normal and rare pieces go well together.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is not a Dimetrodon, first of all Dimetrodon has four legs, this one only has two with dragon hands for feet, secondly and more importantly I suspect LEGO was thinking Spinosaurus originally when designing this thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is a good source for some parts for creature building or MOCing, but as the model pictured on the box, forget about it. It cuts corners for simple and fast building and so suffers from this. I did like that big fin piece though, if I could have figured out how to incorporate it into a different MOC I probably would have kept it, but that would have dissapointed whatever child eventually wound up with my four Baby Dinosaurs sets because one of the pieces would have been missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoid this set unless you're looking for parts. I don't hate it, I just feel that it could stand to use another turn at the designing phase. Or at least call it what it is supposed to be LEGO, I mean seriously, Dimetrodon it is not.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
