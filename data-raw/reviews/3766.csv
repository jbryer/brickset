"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-02T00:00:00Z","","Well, for some reason I got it. I didn't like the cover model much, but I made a snazzy convertible (spoiler, low to the ground, etc...) out of all the pieces, minus one, and a few other pieces. I think I ruined that with the police stickers though. It doesn't egzactly fit in with my town. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-29T00:00:00Z","","A great set! I don't think Lego has ever come out with a police car as a separate set. Well I just want to say I have this set and it's really cool. (although a little overpriced, as all Lego is) The policeman is NOT a girl, it's a nicely detailed minifigure. Another good part about this set is you get two transparent 1x2 tiles!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-26T22:51:14Z","Nice car, nice parts","This is a great set for all town builders.  It's nice to see that with World City Lego is getting back to real sets and away from Town Jr.  As built, the car is too long. No problem, I took the pieces and built something more to my liking. The headlights and taillights are perfect as light bars on tow trucks, firetrucks, etc.  Buy two of these, one for your city, one for the parts bin.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-27T06:00:49Z","Cool car","Well I bought this for 6.50â‚¬ while being in Italy. It's a cool police car,but too long.Sadly it didn't fit to my other displayed town sets before getting the Train Station.
I miss the doors of older sets and this 4x1 Panel seems to be juniorized,but otherwise a good car. And all in all much better,than the juniorized ones I saw between 1997 and 2000.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is pure genius!
It is sleek and modern looking.
However, (as others have mentioned)there is no roof!
I honestly don't really care , as it gets annoying

"Jon_Brick","2007-12-15T21:01:25.123Z","Needs adjustment.","This set was okay considering it was  cheap I bought about three  of these and took off the headlights (to bulky and ugly ) and adjusted it so it had a roof (but I shouldn't have to do that. An okay set 6/10.

pros:
 walkie talkie
 cop 

cons: 
 original design",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"yaraelpoof","2008-08-15T08:50:50.39Z","A nice addition to your lego city!","This set has true playability, and if any kid gets it they will love it. The squad car was cheap for what it is and had a great build. The wheels go nicely with this set, and the roof tiles look great on the front and back. The policeman has a great smile and has a radio. This set is awesome and I give it a five.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-02-15T04:40:32.56Z","Nice squad car, but has its cons.","This was the first set I ever got. Anyway, onto the review.
PROS
Its cheap.
Nice police officer
Easy to build
Bright headlights, aswell as red and blue thing.
Walkie talkie.
Makes a nice convertible!
Looks nice with other World City sets.
CONS
Stickers! But i always say, atleast you can choose whever you have the detail or not.
Wheels are way too small.
Too long.
Very low.
Police officer is almost bigger than the car.

A nice addition to a lego town. You could get more than one and have a nice car chase!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-12T01:33:26.857Z","Police Cars get New Makeover","This squad car is very modern indeed. But if you are into realisticness, this car may not be the one for you. First, the car has no roof. This is wrong for police cars because they can easily get shot in the head. Second, the car is too sporty looking. There is no wrong here, but the car's design is like a sport roadster which gives the example that the police is the one speeding here. Also, the car has a killer shape (look at how many sharp edges it's got!) Apart from that, I must say that the minifig is excellent.

I received it as a gift but would never have chosen it myself.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>To me this police car represents a low point in LEGO City design. The car doesn't look very good even compared to cars from '80s LEGO! And I don't just say this because I grew up back then - I think the current LEGO City cars are great.</div><div><br></div><div>The head- and taillight bricks are terrible because they are just one brick. And the wheelarches, well, &nbsp;there aren't any really, which makes the car really not cool to look at.</div><div>Add to this the fact that because of the bulky bricks you can hardly change the car or create something else with just these parts... I cannot recommend this set.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,2,2,2,3,2
"iwybs","2018-09-27T20:38:26.767Z","A fun little Police Interceptor","<p>The World City Squad Car is a good example of set design during Lego&#39;s brush with bankruptcy in the early 2000s.&nbsp; Thanks to a plethora of new parts, sets from the time looked radically fresh and new compared to those of the previous decade, but the set designers were still learning to use new parts like wedge plates and curved slopes, so the results sometimes looked clunky and unrefined.&nbsp; World City itself is perhaps the clearest expression of the era, as it is the bridge between Town and City: short-lived and clearly with a foot in both eras, such that Brickset&nbsp;could easily classify it as a subtheme&nbsp;of either larger theme but instead classifies it separately.</p>

<p>The Town cars of the late 1990s, known pejoratively as the &quot;Town Junior&quot; era, were extremely simple.&nbsp; The sides were built up with bricks and doors; the hoods were simple slope bricks; the headlights were either 1x1 plates underneath the slope bricks or just printed slopes; small cars never had a roof or rear windshield; as often as not the tires were large balloons that didn&#39;t fit the chassis; and the cars were almost always built on an extremely limited vehicle base that allowed for no flexibility in the placement of the driver&#39;s seat or the wheels.&nbsp; Even as a kid, I thought them boring and ugly, because they didn&#39;t look like real cars.</p>

<p>Then along came World City, and suddenly we had a little police car that looked almost like a Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.&nbsp; The new curved plates used for the hood and trunk closely resembled the smooth curves of the second-generation police interceptor that appeared in superhero movies like&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man</em>&nbsp;and <i>Spider-Man 2</i>, and on the streets in my home town.&nbsp; Turned on their sides, the Jack Stone siren pieces became gloriously big headlights and taillights that matched the curves of the hood, again like a Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.&nbsp; The clever use of four white headlight brackets allowed a radiator grille in front! And bumpers!&nbsp; None of these features appeared in any of the Town Junior cars I was familiar with.&nbsp; The new trans-black windscreen matched the color of the glass I saw on cop cars around town.&nbsp; The wheels almost fit in the wheel arches, though they were a bit too broad.&nbsp; Finally, the police officer looked like a friendly guy this time, not like a grim bully hiding under sunglasses who would as soon send you to jail as cite you for speeding and would definitely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;help get your cat out of a tree.&nbsp; It&#39;s worthwhile to note, too, that the vehicle base used for this Squad Car had been introduced a few years before for Town Formula One cars, but had never previously been used in a regular car for wide release.&nbsp; Since 2003, it&#39;s been used as the base for an astonishingly wide variety of cars in different lines and scales.</p>

<p>This kit does have some flaws.&nbsp; The wedge plates used on either side of the driver&#39;s seat don&#39;t make much sense, the siren mount comes off too easily, the stickers are fragile and easily damaged, the wheels have extremely low clearance, and one wishes for a rear windscreen and a roof.&nbsp; The police car, taxi, and civilian car in the 2003 Spider-Man line didn&#39;t have these problems: they had rear windshields, roofs, and slightly more complex builds.&nbsp; But they weren&#39;t in $4 lunch-money sets, and this was.&nbsp; Later four-wide cars in the City line have much more substantial builds and more realistic detailing, but they also rely on specialized wheel arches and SNOT parts to support the front and rear fascias.&nbsp; For my money, the 2003 World City Squad Car and Spider-Man cars are the best brick-built 4-wide cars ever released, thanks to their realism and innovative use of new parts without relying on specialized molds to substantially define the shape of the car.</p>
