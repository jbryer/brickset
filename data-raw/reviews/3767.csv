This is the most realistic small lego helicopter to date and the pilot is amazing! He wears a sort of blue/black leather uniform and across his back reads &quot;POLICE&quot;. He has also got cool silver sunglasses and the pulley thing and the camera are good additions. Good propellors and tail, overall very good!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-25T17:26:30Z","Very Good Surveillance Chopper!","     World city needs a fast, police recon copter, and this is it! It is a very ncie set, but only has 87 bricks which is very nauseous. The cockpit is an easy-make because it is really only the 2 canopy pieces. The rotor is nice with the new blades and I especially love the tail rotor. It is more of a fan and lego finally made a nice, jettish looking fan! It can swivel down or around according to area of flight! The policeman is the good silver-shaded dude and has a nice police-customized pilot jumpsuit! The controls are okay and everything else is nice, so is the recon camera! 
A nice small set to add to the police force.

This is one of the, if not the worst, helicopters Lego has ever, it's terrible.  The cockpit doesn't close, the landing gear is weak.  It's pretty much a Technic set with a thrown in minifigure.

I whole 95% of the World City sets, this is easily the worst one.  Avoid at all cost, there are better sets.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-02-28T14:32:58.75Z","good set. period.","as it was quite cheap this was the first world-city-set i bought, and it made me buy even more. since any modern western society demands a big deal of spying and surveillance, it is a must for a contemporary town layout.
for a small and modern helicopter it has the proper design, and as one other review stated, there are a lot of technic parts involved, which makes is a interesting hybrid build. the large windscreens can be used for many other purposes, like spaceships or modern vehicles, if you don't apply the sticker.

"Falconhood","2006-07-26T08:57:29Z","EXCELLENT!","great pieces, very streamline, uses alot of advance pieces. i have had lego helicopters ever since the mid 1990s, and this is the coolest yet. (close second place goes to the Alpha Team Ice Blade that transforms like a M.A.S.K. vehicle)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T01:41:15.467Z","Good sized Copter with a few flaws","The parts that are used to make this set are a mix, seems some did come from the technics part bin. The cockpit is only two clear pieces, the sides are wide open. I do like the three blades on top because the can hinge upward, makes it easy to store in my 6&quot; deep LEGO display cabinet. The camera on the side is good and the winch on the other side can be used in rescue work. The tail rotar is very very cool, however this copter is very fragile. Mid sized helicopter is great addition to any police force in LEGO town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-13T22:25:36.967Z","Bad Copter","This is a really bad helicopter made back in 2003. The cockpit isn't that great and the legs are a bit weird. The rotors are nice and the minifigure is cool in the set, but everything else is just really awful.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"toofpikk","2010-02-04T11:56:45.67Z","ok.","This set came as one of the final sets for town. the only reason I bought this set is because I needed it to get every police set there was like this (in other words, all the other last police sets for Lego town). 

3? 3 because it doesn't really stand up, its very fiddly and delicate. 

it comes with 1 minifigure and a few rare pieces, but apart from that i wouldn't really suggest buying this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Plasmodium","2011-04-27T13:35:24.487Z","Good, but don't fork out for it.","<p>I got this helicopter for Christmas one year. It is a very easy and simple build, and ends up as a very modern (almost futuristic?) helicopter. I must admit that I quite like it's elegant design, if perhaps less realistic to more recent ones. It is a smaller type of helicopter than most modern ones, but on a slightly larger scale.</p><p>It includes a quite a few interesting pieces--notably the cabin, the tail prop and the video camera. It can be a little flimsy, though, and the stickers crack and peel after a while.</p><p>Mine has spent quite some time as a starfighter, the pieces lend themselves quite well to that. Unfortunately I lost one of the rotors (but altered it to work with just two)</p><p>The rotors themselves can be a problem, sometimes they catch on the cabin roof. The skids also seem to be the wrong length--the technics rods stick out of the casing, which is a little annoying.</p><p>However (as a starfighter or helicopter) this set has afforded me great hours of play these past years, with it's easy build and 'swoosh-ability'. I wouldn't recommend spending exorbitant amounts on it, but at a cheap price (or a&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;present) it's not too bad.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
