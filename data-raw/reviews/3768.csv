"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-16T17:50:02Z","This is a pretty good world city set","This is probably the best World City set so far. The undercover van rocks! not only does it have back doors, but the roof comes off. It comes with a agent that looks like the Matrix agents or a MIB agent. The 4WD is the worst part of this set. The back wheels are higher than the front and I don't like the way they did the front of the 4WD. With just a few modificatins, I made the 4WD into a good-looking police vehicle. The set also comes with a lot of extra acessories, but I don't think that Lego should have priced the set so high. Overall good set

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-29T00:48:47Z","Nice little set","The set is nice, I got it on sale for like 30% off. The sets main problem would be the price, it should not be more than $12 tops.The van is nice, with lots of room for thngs, and nice back doors. The car is a neat off road looking police car. The set also has cool looking cops, and tools. Another plus is that it has lights! They are not painted on like the last &quot;town&quot; sets were. It's just a great design mixing mostly old pieces with a couble new ones to make a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-31T12:18:47Z","This is the F.B.I! Freeze!","Excellent set. The 4wd is fine with a good space at the back to store things and I really like the van(FBI?). The back of the van opens up to store things but you can only fit one minifig (lying down) in the back of the van. The minifigs are great. I use one of them as the head of the FBI for my police force and the other I use as a SWAT. The only cons are that you can only fit on person in the front seat of each vehicle. Overall a nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-02T08:44:48Z","Where Do The Badges Go ?","I love this set ,but when the minifigs aren`t holding the badges I don`t know where they go. The secret agent is awesome and so is his computer. I love his van and how the back doors open . The 4wd is also good , but the doors on both cars are to small. Overall this is one of my favorite police car sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Flex","2007-10-11T23:28:20.047Z","Great!","This set has great playability, as it includes:
HW patol truck,
Undercover van,
Roadblock,
2 Cones,
Laptop,
Video camera,
Police badge(I got 2)

With all these accessories why didn't I give it a 5?
Well the major downer for this set is thet it's so small
for its $15 price tag.

"EL_Mo","2008-01-24T18:17:09.903Z","Nice addition to any collection.","I actually got this set for $1 at a yard sale. The box had never even been open. Anyway, the vehicles are pretty nice and seem to fit the people very nicely. I like how their are roofs on the cars unlike some sets.       The van is very nice and I use it quite often. I am not sure what happened to the 4WD, but I am trying to build it again. Although I really like it, I for sure would not pay full price. I mean $15, thats insane!
If you can get it for cheap, I would recommend it to anyone.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-03-20T17:33:15.043Z","super clandestine!","personally i have never seen an actual police 4wd, this one here looks like an updated reissue of the set 6533 from 1992, nothing special so far.
what really makes me smile is the undercover van, which is so inconspicuous that you hardly notice the HUGE camera on the roof to spy out the surroundings, not to talk of the BIG satellite dish that hardly attracts any attention. finally the agent with the big sunglasses would never ever make anyone think he was anything else but a nice guy :-)

make no mistake, i like the set, it has a good parts selection, including nice black train windows and a lot of useful standard parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T01:48:28.56Z","Two more Police vehicles to keep LEGO town safe","The set is what it is: two small vehicles with some style. Like the van kinda unique, mini figures are cool, lots of accesories to go with set - price could have been lower but I feel it was ok purchase. The vehicles add to the Police headquarters and the entire force because they are to scale. If you need to beef up your towns Police - consider adding this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-05-24T16:21:45.467Z","What do ya mean you can't get through the door? What, it ain't big enough?","This set consists of two cars, a cool undercover van and police 4X4. 
The minifigs are super, we get the cool agent with shades and cool hairstyle along with a brilliant NY type police agnet with the all too familiar angry face. I really prefer these police men to the current ones, which all seem to have an angry face (mind you, i can't say any different about World City ones...). Anyway, these police men look way cooler. One has a walkie talkie, the other a small keypad thing.
The undercover van is very nice, its all dark black except for the headlights and lights atop, calssic trans red and trans blue. The inside of the van has space for any gadgets (I filled mine with weapons!), and with a little modification it could fit a person sitting up. Like most other vehichles innthis theme, it has clip things on the sides for tools. This is a bit thin, at four studs wide unlike most city vehichles of today, but i like that, cause in this case it lets it slip down alley ways chasing FBI's most wanted!, and the 4 stud wide cars and trucks fit much better in towns. Atop the truck is a little video camera, storable in the truck/van. The back doors on this are very nice, like cabinet doors.
The police 4X4 is also good. I like how it is meant to be a high speed truck, the 'gate' on front for ramming through bad guys secret hideouts. It looks very powerful and heavily armoured. There is a little place at the back for some traffic cones, and again has clips on the sides for tools. One small con is that that man is pretty cramped in there! I should add on both vehicles the doors are tiny, hallf under the side of the windscreen, but they do add realism to both vehichles.
Overall, this a super addition to your town, and the great World City theme that got me into Lego. I would reccomend it to all City fans, and any secret agents type movie fans (who like lego aswell, ofcourse!)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
