"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-30T17:37:39Z","This is a big truck!","This set is really cool.  The truck is 6 studs wide and 16 studs long (not including the bumpers).  The mini-figs are great, and the truck driver comes with a bullet proof vest.  At 186 pieces there is a good amount of building, but the price, $30 CND or $20 US, is a bit steep.  Eventhough the instructions call for a utility box to be installed in place of the right hand door, the set does come with the right hand door and the extra sticker for it.  It also includes 3 money pieces, 3 jewels, and 4 gold bars.  The crook has 2 safe breaking tools plus a hook attached to a rope on his trike.  I recommend this set to any fans of Town, esspecially if you can get in sale.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-11T13:54:40Z","An Italian Job","MODEL: (9): Nice design. The detail is very good. I especially like the locking doors. The cycle is great two. The combination of colors adds to the detail. A few things that could have been better are 1) exclude stickers, 2) I would have preferred the old green safes as opposed to the plain gray that need stickers to enhance, and 3) the safes and gold bars need to be attached to close the doors. These kinds of items are better just setting in (usually on smooth pieces) to make removal easier.
PLAYABILITY: (10): Offers much play with the van, cycle, two detailed figs, and lots of fun pieces like the safe, money, gold bars, gems, and rope. Set is great to recreate the Italian Job.
PIECE SELECTION/ALTERNATE MODELS: (8) A small assortment of black/white parts and light bricks – definitely specialized to build this vehicle. The back of box does offer some other ideas like a boat and crane.
PRICE: (6): At $20 for a van/truck with a motorcycle, rather expensive. $10 normal price would have been much more reasonable. Soon, LEGO will be charging us in excess of $30 for single mini-fig vehicles.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-19T19:39:41Z","Great Set!!!","I just bought this set today I'm very pleased with it! What I like about it is that it comes with not 1, not 2, not even 3, but FOUR &quot;gold bars&quot;!! also some gems and cash. I also like how the back doors open up and when you close it you can lock it up. I thought that was pretty neat. As for the doors I didn't use that storage thing. I thought that looked kinda dumb. and I agree that this set could have gone without the bike.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I didnt mind the pricetag because i felt shelling out the &quot;extra&quot; cash was worth it, the minifigs great (Classic workman vest!) and the robber on the trike is a great add-on. The only complaint i have is the SWAT officer doesnt have a Stormtrooper gun to protect the van with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-31T12:25:58Z","World City criminals beware!","This set is brilliant. The van is amazing and with some minor removal of pieces you can fit 4 people in it. The slip-on armour is a lovely addition, the police guy in this I use as the chief SWAT. The bike is good, although one of the new 3wheeler types and the crook is great. The gold bars are well appreciated and so are the safes, gems, money and the rope pulley. Great work Lego!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-02T08:59:46Z","Great set!!","This is the first World City set that I purchased and it is worth every penny! An excellent set with loads of playability. I really like the six-wide vehicles lego is producing. Very nice designs.
I also love the armoured vest the security guy is wearing. I do prefer the older motorcycles to the new &quot;trikes&quot;. Plus it's not clear to me how the heck the criminal could have robbed the van as shown on the cover of the box.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-04T19:26:27Z","Make Way for Millions of $ in GOLD!","       This is a very neat set, seeing that lego has never rusted up a real armoured car! The car is humongous, just about too big to fit on a LEGO road plate, but it'll get through as long as no cars are in front of it. The driver is a cool looking dude with a cool suit, cool cap, and cool vest! He gets the joy of a roomy cockpit- and the envy of every crook in the way!  On the back side, is a roomy cargo area that opens using a unique mechanism! Inside is the real stuff, 4 gold plates (GOLD BRICKS, NOT JUST 
YELLOW), and a few safes with jewels and dollar bills tucked away in them. It is indeed heavily armored. The crook is the psycho guy with the gold teeth and the lumberjack garb! He rides a black trike with a tow cable, and chain saws to rench under that armor, (Nice try, pal, but you wont prevail). Actually, this car can also be used as a bradley assault vehicle, you can fit 3 minifigs sitting down in the cargo space, and send this car in the midst of battle, and then open up the cover doors and out scrambles troops, I think this is the best way to do stuff with it, but thats me!!!! A good 9 for some reason, I cant remember, but go ahead and get it!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-12T04:38:33.957Z","auri sacra fames!","its a pity this car is out of the catalogue already, it goes very well with the city models of this season. it is made mainly out of standard bricks, some technic parts, with a nice mechanism of the cars back doors. 
also you get a really mean-looking criminal, who probably needs the gold bars to renew his own gold tooth that is revealed by his disgusting grin. the security guy does not seem to have a solution for the whole situation, he is unarmed (i'm sure that a re-release of this set would include a broad selection of fire arms, perhaps even perhaps even torture instruments).

"mrmitch","2008-02-11T01:55:57.827Z","Love the 6 wide vehicle!","Armoured vehicles are supposed to be bigger and heavier to protect its cargo, this one does not disappoint. Fits in well with the &quot;force&quot; and gives you other play ideas with the robbery-recovery scene. Like the trike, mini figures are great, cool gold bars in the set.

"Hewkii1992","2008-08-23T20:10:36.873Z","One of World City's best.","I am not usually biased in my reviews, but in my opinion, this is one of the best LEGO kits the World City theme has to offer.  For twenty US dollars, you get a greatly detailed armor car, an attack bike, and two well detailed minifigures.

The Armored car is the crown jewel of this set, sporting many details such as plenty of smokey-clear windows, a neat black and white design, a well designed grill and head-lights, a neat 'locking' mechanism towards the rear, four gold bars on a plate, two compartments for storing two one-hundred dollar bills and a sapphire, emerald, and ruby, a working driver's door, and a compartment hiding a bullet proof &quot;SWAT&quot; vest and 'key' tools for opening the doors.  The vehicle is extremely well designed, and it remains one of my favorites.

The bike is nothing too special, however, it does include a winch and two tools.  The minifigures are also well designed, featuring a menacing burglar with a gold tooth, and a grey-clad security man.

A definite 9 out of 10.  If you can find this anywhere (possibly only online nowadays), I highly recommend it for your police force.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the gold bars alot because they are very cool. The body armor for the driver is pretty cool, but should have a gun with him. This is definitely the best World City set by far.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-19T12:36:49.967Z","Unbreakable! Very useful!","This set goes perfect with any police station. If your city doesn't have a bank and you need somewhere to store loot, this set is perfect.

Pros:

-Design gives an impression of toughness (it really is tough, doesn't just look like it)
-Opening door for driver! Something you barely see nowadays!
-Cabinet on passenger side stores the keys to open the back doors where the loot is stored
-There are two safes, one with 3 hundred dollar bills, one with a red, a green, and a blue jewel
-4 ingots of gold!
-Ingenious key mechanism! You take the ""keys"" (they are actually tap pieces) attach it to the grey studs on the side of the van, turn it, and the doors will open
-Comes with a trike, and it has a circular saw, chainsaw, and winch
-The set comes with a security guard with armor, and a crook

Cons:

-The overall design is a bit too simple and plain
-The front of the van where the grille is could use more work
-Tires of van could have mudguards

Overall this is a great set with high playability. The gold pieces are to die for! I recommend it to anyone, although you're not missing out on anything if you don't have it.

"bryck123","2011-08-07T22:02:50.377Z","GREAT armoured car...so so trike","<p>This was the first set I bought since I was a kid and its a gem in the otherwise so so World City theme. The build is fun and the parts are just ok but the design is spectacular. The one draw back is the trike it seems like a total afterthought. It seems like they blew all their design time on an awesome truck and then just kinda threw in a trike to up the part count at the last second before the design deadline.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Design of the truck is one of the best single Lego vehicles i have ever seen<br></li><li>Great value<br></li><li>love the opening door on the truck and the key system for the locked up part</li><li>Security guard with body armour is cool (why do they never include armour with the police sets?)</li><li>LOVE the red and blue lights on the truck....if only they would give those in the police or fire sets...<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Trike is an afterthought<br></li></ul>
<p>Buy this set for the armoured car plain and simple its a great model. <br></p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,5
