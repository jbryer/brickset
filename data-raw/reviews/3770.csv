"Jon_Brick","2007-12-15T21:16:48.64Z","Excellent!","This is one of the best sets from lego ever I've always wanted a set like this it's basicaly a mobile police station  and althought the biker can't be on the bike when it's in the trunk it's still a great set. I love the barriers and they are stored well and that the side opens up but it should have more cops 9/10

pros :
2 cops 
bike 
computers

cons :
bike storage (how do they get it out)
why don't the cops have guns?

"CrzyLCF","2009-06-26T17:34:16Z","""Probably one of the best mobile police station out there!""","I got this set for my birthday a couple of years ago and I must say I am extremely impressed by it! This set contains an amazingly detailed truck with a nice big trailer attached to it which is actually a mobile police station and at the back of the trailer is a hidden motorbike which can be taken out. There are also two police officers and plenty of accessories in the set. Let's get right into the thick of the action!<br><br>The truck is a neat little vehicle with a lot of exterior details such as the handles on the sides which the minifigs can grab onto and it has two stickers on each door. There are also two windows with white frames on each side. In front of the vehicle there is a Police sign and just above it there is a huge engine and above the engine is the windshield. The roof of the truck has two white side slope bricks on each side with a Police sign on them. Just above the signs are the police lights with 1x2 trans blue and red pieces and in between them are binoculars. At the back of the truck is a secret vault which you can open and close and there is also the number 7034 which is in fact the number of this set. A little further back is a 2x4 brick with three holes in them which you can attach the trailer onto it. If you want to take a look on the inside of the truck you have to remove the roof. There is nothing really special inside as there is only a blue steering wheel and a blue seat. My only complaints about the truck is that space is very limited inside and the stickers! (I will mention this more than once)<br><br>Now the most exciting part of this review, the trailer itself! The base part of the trailer is basically one huge piece. You can detach the trailer by tilting it back and then you can put the stands down to keep it in one place. At the top of the trailer there is an antenna which you can move up or down. A little further back on the roof there is a sattelite and two yellow lights which you can also move up or down. At the front side of the trailer there is a white door on opposite ends which features two white stands with 1x2 trans red pieces inside. You can take the stands out and put them beside the trailer so that the civillains don't trespass beyond that point. Just beside the white door there are two black doors with a white frame on each side. These doors contain four types of equipment; a white helmet with black glasses when the officer decides to use the motorcycle, walkie talkie , megaphone and binoculars which all come in dark gray.<br><br>Beside the black doors there are 3 walls and 3 windows on the left side, but on the right side there are only 2 walls. That is because the third wall is actually a handle which you can pull towards yourself and then move it upwards to reveal the inside of the trailer! Sadly, there isn't much inside as there is a 2x4 slope light gray brick on the left side and a 3x4 slope light gray brick on the right side which both have computers imprinted on them. Just above the computers on the right side there is a screen with a map on it. In the middle of the inside of the trailer there are 2 blue seats facing the opposite way from each other. Once again there is limited space inside the trailer which is a big disappointment. A little further back to the sides there is a huge police sign. At the back there is a black door with yellow and red stripes to the sides and once again it has the number of the set in between the stripes. You can open the door upwards to reveal the motorbike which you can take out! The motorbike is pretty small but it adds a nice touch to this set. The front wheel can turn and it has two wheels at the back.<br><br>Well that sums it up. I am giving this set a 4 because of the limited space in the truck and the trailer. The stickers were another big problem. But other than that, this set is really great and it's probably one of the best mobile police stations out there!<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
