PROS:
The new cops are good figs for SWATs.
The chief looks nicely surly.
The jail van is good and the ATV, though juniorised, is nicer in real life than in the pic.
A LOT of clear pieces. 
Orange jail clothes.
The 2X2 SNOT plate on the top floor is the most. detailed. piece. ever.
Tally marks on the jail walll.
Good accessory assortment.
Air conditioning!
CONS:
UGLY faces. The white pupils scare me.
Parking space is too small.
Too many stickers.
Some stickers cover multiple bricks.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Those are the only &quot;new&quot; pieces too for the most part.  Only the top of the cars, and the sides of the ATV, are new pieces, not over juniorized at all. The biulding itself is fun, you have the tower which has 3 nice doors in a good color. The bottom is ememty there, but the second and 3rd floor have computers, one with Windows on it. The cross-over is cool and has a safe area underneath. The garage is fine and the jailcell is nice with details and a sticker counting the days he has been in jail. The figures are really nice, and comes with four of them. The van has two door shelf things and hatch back. The ATV is the oddest thing, and the closest we might ever get to getting a Lego made tank. There's a nice computer in it, and has some nice pieces, like the wheels. If you want a police car then buy the $4 one Lego makes, if you want a helicopter buy and older one because the World City one is bad. I just changed the colour of my Alpha Team one and it looks good. It's not a perfect 10 but it's the best biulding Lego has made in about 8 years, besides the train shed.
