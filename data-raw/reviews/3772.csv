The minifig is great and I like how ths scuba tank is attached.  unfortunately, the odd light arrangement on the on the roll bar detracts from the appearance of an otherwise nice set.  I used a couple of plates with clips to lights to the front for a greatly improved appearance.

Don't you thing they should bring back the 2 wheeled motorcycles instead of the stupid little 3 wheeled trikes or aka motercycles??? Well back to this set... It could include a little area like a station (A little one) for the 4 wheeler to park and maybe a sharn vacationing mini figs maybe another 4wheeler or a little boat ... and maybe a person to save from the water for the helicopters because world city has nobody to save just the people that save them! And a heli. landing area I will stop seeing this is long enough see ya! :P ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

The set includes some 1x1 square trans bits which are pretty uncommon these days and an interesting little square bar thing among other things
The diver Mini-figâ€™s torso is a bright orange vest with respirator gear, the head is okay and does not look goofy like Some of the earlier World City Guys did.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-17T22:35:53Z","Great","My parents bought this set for the Operation Christmas Child Samaritain's Purse that my family will be sending this Christmas. Anyways, I was intrigued by this little set so I bought it Target for $ 4.30. I built the set and really like it. The driver/diver is cool and the vehicle is also very cool.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-24T20:12:01Z","Only Good with other CW Stuff","       I liked this probably just because we already had the Coast Watch HQ and i got this with the rescue chopper. It is small, a good little ATV. The guy is awesome, a head i can like, and I can finally get some scuba-diving stuff for a low price!!! He has a grey tank with regulator, orange fins, a grey helmet with jet-black vizor, a cool aqua-coast watch suit with neat navy blue sleeves and pants. The little ATV is only good with other coast watch sets, otherwise you cant go a really long ways with it. That is my only con about this. Get it, if you get the rescue chopper, which rocks like crazy!
All in all, tiny but great with something else. A solid 9 yo! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-10-18T17:18:01.25Z","no nobel-price for this one","just one of these tiny sets to fill the gaps in your shopping cart: inexpensive, easy to build and even easier to forget. as expected there are no major flaws, some useful parts, and those fat tyres that overcrowd anyones car-accessory-box(es). if don't own it, dont' be sad, go and get yourself a racer, they are way better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:00:34.14Z","Good value - add protection to the beachs in your town today","This set is cool, it has Coast Guard theme, a four wheeler to cruise up &amp; down the sand. Get gear to get into the water for a rescue. I really like the color sceme and the looks of this small affordable set. Have not taken it apart since I bought it new - I like the little dude.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-07-07T03:33:04.403Z","A Sweet Rescue Vehicle","I'm quite surprised this set isn't more popular. It is really a fully upgraded beach buggy, with lots of nice curves and detail. The front piece is printed, NOT STICKERED, it is controlled by handle bars, mounted spotties and diving kit at the back. This model has everything a small rescue vehicle could need, large tyres, high guards, spot and tail lights, oxygen tank and flippers. It even has a roll bar and a tow point at the front just in case.

The mini-fig is wearing an orange gloves and an orange safety vest, with blue sleeves and blue pants. He also has a grey helmet with a cool black visor. His face is smiling, confident and detailed.

Overall this model is very nice, in particular the orange pieces, which weren't very common and really add to the aesthetics and colour scheme of the vehicle. The price was right about $3.00AU and it doesn't have any stickers. Overall I feel this one is about a 6/10 or Above Average. A good one to add into your town or rescue collection. I feel it is a must have though just due to the mini-fig, especially with the cool orange hands.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-05-24T16:39:45.607Z","Coast Watch: World city style","Thi set is basically a jeep with gadgets. The fig is very nice, and comes with a helmet (black visor) and flippers, and an air tank, alll stowable on the truck. The truck is big and could go through sand easily, well done Lego, some of your vehicles are rubbish when it comes to how well they would work in real life.
There are spotlights on the truck, and a nice steering wheel, that looks kinda like a games controller in my opinion!
Overall, this is a very good set, nice with other World City Coast Guard sets.
4 out of 5, cause theres nothing special about this set, though it is very good. It will look good on your lego towns beach!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zako11","2010-08-13T16:23:59.207Z","Orange Hands","theres not that much in the set but it sure is fun to play with and is the 1st out of 2 sets to include orange hands(although there is also to make a 3rd the&nbsp;exclusive minifig in the lego universe game)i mainly got this set for the orange hands so i could make a custom mawhonic so he now has grey hands but im glad i got the set because its really fun to play with and also you can put the breathing apparatus and flippers on the diver to put him in an ""underwater"" mode ,this set is completely worth getting so get it&nbsp;",FALSE,4,5,4,5,5
