The style of the boat makes me think of a drug runner's boat instead of a fire fighters boat.  Others have made mention of the flip-down nozzle so I won't beat a dead horse about that.  The front of the hull is a new piece.  It integrates well with the rest of the curved pieces that were introduced last year.  The best and worst part is that the old style 4x4 plate with 4-finger hinge has been replaced by a click-hinge version.  I found that when you try to move the hatch, the stiffness of the hinge causes the 1x4 plate to seperate from the rest of the boat. On a positive note, the hatch snaps flat with out needing anything to prop it up.  I would recommend this as sleak addtion to your Lego harbour. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-08T12:06:10Z","An OK little Fire boat","I just got this set last night (May 7, 2004) and it builds a nice little boat, but it has some flaws.

   BOAT:Now lets get to the heart of the set. I hate how you use stickers to add detail to the set, which makes playing with it in the water a pain. Also it has no steering wheel it has been replaced by a new control piece(1x4).It has a little rack to hold the radio and binoculars.The old water cannon has also been replaced by a chainsaw body and nozzle which means you don't get two goblets when taken apart. The click-hing peice which houses the water cannon sometimes makes the 1x4 click-hing peice  sepierate from the rest of the boat. The boat has a drug dealer look to it which I like. 

    MINIFIG: The minifig in this set consist of a new body, black legs, the head from the world city helicopter
and the classic firefighter helmet and  a new lifejacket. The lifjacket is pretty cool but not as good as the oringinal.

   OVERALL: A good set that is a good addition to any lego town or collection. Despite some minerflaws I incourage you to buy it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-19T01:59:51Z","Great boat","I love the design and the sleekness with the nozzle retracted. The only downside is the quarter steps latching hinge for the nozzle, a classic smooth action piece would be better.

I have two other fire boats and this is my favorite.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:09:07.513Z","Mid sized boat to help the department from the river or lake.","Price is right, like the way the water cannon folds up when needed. Solid design and easy to build, could have used a second fireman. Nice looking set and has remained assembled since I got it. Valued addition to any Fire Dept in your town or city collection.

"legoguysw","2008-09-06T09:15:31.95Z","One of Worlds City's many good sets","The overall attitude towards World City from what I've heard is that is was bad. Those people obviously haven't seen all the sets.
This set is great. It has a firefighter with a life jacket, and radio. The boat has good hull pieces, and a hose hidden in the front. It doesn't come out very easily, a smooth hinge would have been better that a click hinge, but it is a cool idea anyhow. There are 'wings' on the back with lights, and nice curved pieces each side.
Overall a 4, nothing special, but still a great set, now getting to be pretty old, and more and more a part of Classic Town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-20T06:45:28.61Z","fire fighter to the rescue","This is cool.  It has a boat with a big water sprayser.  It also has a firefighter with life vest.  It is a =t no shortage of good pieces with the pre built botton and cool fins.  It also floats.  This set is so cool it is a must have for city fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
