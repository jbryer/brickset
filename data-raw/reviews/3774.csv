Atleast the two rescue ones out so far. I'd expect 20-25 USD. I especially like how this one seats two people side by side. One thing missing, a stretcher. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-23T13:24:44Z","Excelent","This is one of the best helicopters LEGO has ever made. It has a spacious cockpit, and is covered in little things to fiddle with, the winch is great especially when you turn it into a zip line. It has room for the stretcher in the back but unfortunatly not for someone to sit next to it and look after the rescuey, which is another minor flaw theres no one to rescue in the set nor are there any other world city sets that have people to rescue, just the people to rescue them!
It has a bouy which you can deploy (nice touch) and it generally just looks good.
The parts selection is good, I particulary like the relativly new cockpit piece. 
The only real problem is that the design is abit over crowded, the colours are abit mixed up and there to much stuff pocking out of it. If you just take the engines off the front it looks much nicer.
All problems aside this really is a very good set and I recomend getting it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-13T20:46:02Z","A nice Lego Chopper..","When you open the box you find yourself looking at all the sparkley new pieces and thinking stuff like..
Ohh I never had one of those pieces before, that bit should be useful, Etc.. and then about a minute later you painfully remember and discover that most of those “good bits” are printed in the disgusting new grey colours. &gt;_&lt;
It was a fun model to build though. 

The Helicopter itself is loaded with features like:
A working boom &amp; drop line that can fold to the side of the chopper, a stretcher that is stored in the chopper and can be lowered on the B&amp;D Line, an adjustable nose mounted spotlight, a opening rear hatch that deploys a buoy.
Two Storage boxes holding the winch equipment, landing-gear on the bottom of the chopper.      
One of the reasons I bought this was for a canopy that seats two figs as pictured on the front of the box, much to my surprise Lego used a pretty nifty trick to fit two figs side by side in a canopy that would normally only hold 1fig.
One of the Problems is that to get the pilots out or to put them back in requires you to remove the rotors and the front turbines.
The Mini-fig’s are awesome, they have orange rescue jackets with no huge logos on them or anything.
The first guy with the red pilot’s glasses is cool, the other Mini-fig’s head is okay (silver glasses with smile) but has been used about a thousand times before on other World City sets. 
Also Look on the back of the Box on one of the bottom pictures the fig with the red glasses can almost turn his head a full 360 degrees, creepy..

It does not have many large junourized bits in it so it gets points in that department, most of the pieces are useful, it has a good main model with cool Mini-figs
But it loses points for being made in the new greys though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-05T22:36:59Z","The best chopper... period.","What an awesome set to really bring out that LEGO is still LEGO. This one thankfully is what it took to break me from my Star Wars Classic daze :)

I really like the the bright yellow color scheme on this which feels balanced to me. The &quot;new&quot; darker gray colored pieces add contrast to the lighter gray pieces- it all looks great! The aircraft looks fantastic from any angle- LEGO particularly did a great job with the front- it looks so real. The first time I saw the box for this set, it had instantly grabbed my attention.

LEGO added some wonderful details that really put this set on top. The location buoy has it's own compartment in the back and there's a spotlight under the cockpit (reminiscent of the 6342 Beach Rescue Chopper) for instance. There's also landing gear attached to the pontoons and on the bottom of the fuselage, so that the chopper can easily taxi when it has landed on solid ground. The landing gear by the way is perfectly balanced, so that the model does not tip backwards, etc., and rolls smoothly. Also worthy to note, the winch mechanism folds back towards the fuselage for extra streamlining during high-speed manuevers. Storage chests behind each side of the cockpit hold extra equipment needed for optional configuration of the winch and stretcher (stored in the center of the fuselage) for other types of recovery roles.

Another BIG scorer on this set is the dual passenger cockpit. The cool orange mini-figs sit side-by -side (without their arms touching each other)- this is a huge rarity in any LEGO set, not just helicopters. Heck, not even the 4504 Millennium Falcon, which is like 5x bigger, does that! Even cooler still, the engines above the cockpit are actually hinged, so that they raise up when you need to access the cockpit (no need to take any parts off, aside from the windscreen).
The cockpit is also furnished with a cool looking instrument panel (first appearance?) that folds back so that mini-figs can jump into their seats at a moments notice.

To finish things off here, the main rotors spin effortlessly (it's a helicopter after all, so they better!). They are mounted solidly to the fuselage, so you can spin, spin, spin all you want without worries of the roof coming off during a mid-air rescue attempt. This set could easily be modded for air/land-superiority roles as well.

The devil is in the details, and this set is a scorcher. At just $20 US, LEGO has raised the bar on price vs. features to lofty new heights with this exciting rescue chopper.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T20:28:15Z","A pretty cool Purchase","
   I got this set from lego shot at home in July, I can tell you that if you like to pretend stuff with a half-realistic helicopter, than this is your deal. The two mini-figs are the regular world city heads, not to hideous, not to ordinary. I do wish that this cockpit, along with the cockpits of other lego helicopters, would be totally inclosed. The control panel in the cockpit is alright = to little control set for such big of an aircraft. Behind the cockpit is a rather small cargo bay that not even a mini-fig can completely sit down in. The rope/hook deal is pretty cool, but the regular hook thingy drops the stretcher too easily, so I replaced it with a three sided one + and it worked. Two the sides there are little pontoon things that are supported by a gear thingy. The helicopters tail is mainly sunken to much into the helicopters body and makes it short and semi-unrealistic. The 4 bladed rotors on this set are totally awesome. Thank goodness they arent just regular beam peices, whew!!! They will sometimes collide with the btail rotor but there are many ways to preventing this. The booy dropping mechanism is a bit cheesy, but as long as it works I am okay with it. This helicopter surprisingly lands on wheels, which is quit good unless toy make it fly with them. The wheels just make the copter look a little unreal, I would say that you should just take the wheels off and replace it when it lands, just as simple as that!!! 

         Well, I would easily recommend this set for anybody who likes lego branded aircraft. This is a solid 8, which is pretty good. I do think that I paid a little two much for it but 200 some pieces and 2 mini-figs do equal alot. I would tell you that you need this set if you have the Coast Watch HQ (Dont know set #). I think it was a good purchase overall.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-01T19:32:11Z","awesome set","when I first saw this set it cought my attention. I like the way both minifigs sit on the same cockpit without touching each other. I also like that the helicopter has...TELEPHONE PIECE x2! I like the way both engine thingys can be lifted to remove the windshield. the only problem is that theres no victim, and that the telephone parts are not white like in the picture.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I tok this chopper out into the rain alot of times and it was great. Even in a big storm I did and it was so cool. It once broke a little bit but who cares, probably from ware and tare. Well, the Coast watch is cool and this is a really cool helicopter. Atleast it looks real Chris! I hope you all read my review, if you did then thank-you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
