"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-17T04:32:27Z","7045 Hovercraft Hideout","I recently received two of these sets from LEGO SHOP@HOME.

I have posted some photos at http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=63361.

Components of note are the hinged cockpit, real rubber for the simulated air skirt, pivoting fan propulsion system, 2 minifigs plus the rat, and rubber band powered launching system on the back of the hovercraft and on DOCK 13 for the high speed jet ski.

The Shark motif and colors really enhance the smuggling theme of the model. Great MOC potential for riverine based military craft.

My only real criticisms of this set are that the simulated air skirt does not cover the rear of the hovercraft (to allow for the jet ski launnching system)and if you press down too hard on the launching assembly on either the hovercraft or the dock the models tends to come apart.

If Lego had included the extra pieces necessary to enclose the rear of the hovercraft to facilitate alternative designs I would have given this set a higher score.

Overall though a great addition to the World City Theme.

Okay here we go again.. 
Along with the WC rescue chopper the Hovercraft Hideout was also a set I wanted upon seeing a pic of it on the net, and just a week ago I picked one up at Big W for $46.90(aud) 
When I opened this up much to my surprise that it had the old Grey's instead of the new Grey's, I thought this set came out at the same time as the other 2004 WC sets which are all in the new Grey? 
Basically the set consists of the nicley built Hovercraft, one mini speed-boat thing, a small uninspiring little shed, two mini-figs and a rat. 
Also note the all decals in this set are stickers except the large black curve slopes with the shark pattern on them. 

Hovercraft, the good 
This is obviously the highlight part of the set, to start off with it looks allot bigger on the box-art then it does in real-life. 
Basically you slide the speedboat into the back and upon pushing a round thing behind the canopy the the speed-boat ejects out behind the craft. 
Another neat touch is that when you turn one rear turbine the other turns in the same direction as well kudos to Lego for adding that feature. 
Though I really don't like the two engines that stick out from the sides they would look more at home on an F-16 not a Hovercraft. 
The mailboxes/safes are really good they have a black base and a light Grey door, you get a really cool little keypad sticker to put on each of them but the problem is that it takes multiple trys to get them on straight usually resulting in the accidental folding of one of the sticker corners. 
BTW the safes contain two 100 dollar Mini-fig land bills (Man what a heist..) and three gems red blue and yellow in you were wondering. 
The Air skirt is a unique part you get 5 rubber bumper parts which slide onto a special locking part. 
The Hovercraft is great because it has a sleek and smart design that has only one or two small problems. 

The Speed boat, the Bad 
meeeeeee its a small feature of the set but I will review it anyway. 
Nothing much to it it seats one fig and has a storage compartment under the hood where you can store the jewels, money or the Rat. 
What really annoyed me about this boat is that it uses a piece that is just two 2x6 curved slop things stuck together to make one piece, why not just use two 2X6's instead of sticking them together grrrrrr.. 
There also another one underneath but inverted double grrr.. 

The Shed, the Ugly 
Lego should really think about what they name their sets if this shed is the &quot;hovercraft hideout&quot; portion of the set how come the hovercraft has no possible way to hide in or behind it? 
The shed contains a small launching pad for the speedboat like the Hovercraft did but this one dose'nt seem to work as well. 
You also get some trans-muddy-yellow 1x2 tiles for the lights which is nice, and some more black round parts which are always good to have around. 
Includes not many but a few large dark-grey bricks to construct the amazing 2 walls that only function to hold the roof up.. 
And on mine anyway the right window shutter stays such where as the left one flys open at the slightest bump. 

Mini-figs 
You get: The captain this guy reminds me of Captain Nemo from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (the book not the movie) 
He wears a blue jumper with gold buttons and black pants he also wears a black train drivers hat (Yay!) , and his head looks like an evil version of Mac the commander from the Lego LOM series a couple years back. 
The second guy is pretty plain, the head is a new goofy &quot;sawdust for brains&quot; looking criminal head he has a black tank-top and his pants are brown. 
In some pictures the second Guy is shown with huge Tattoos on his arms, mine did not and I was disappointed because that was one of the reasons I bought this set. 
And the first guy has a strange red line down the right side of his head not shown in catalogs 

In conclusion I give this set a 9/10 because of its great pieces and study main model. :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T00:02:43Z","Hovercraft Hideout a winner for 2004.  The Last of the true Light and Dark Grays.  Many new Pieces.","The box for this set in USA indicates 2003 release date and was available in 2003 in early November.  This set contains both Light and Dark Gray pieces of the old, true standard grays--possibly the last set produced by the Lego Company with these colors.

I rate this set a 9.  It is well executed and designed and builds some excellent models with good play-ability.

The color scheme is very good with just the right amount of Black parts and Blue detail pieces.  It is the first set ever to use a BLACK train door Type I and should be a popular set for that reason along.  It is also the first set to have Blue 2x2x2 cones and the new train-type cockpit in black.  This cockpit has a two-finger click-hinge attachement so it can be used in other models for opening and closing.  Unfortunately that feature is not used in this set.  The cockpit glass is Trans-Black.

The Rubber bumpers on the long sides of the craft are one piece about 18 studs long making that a new piece, also.  There is no rubber bumper on the rear of the hovercraft.  The big wedges on the rear of the hovercraft are painted, but otherwise this is the first set to use that piece in Black.

The black 1x4x3 window of the little shack has Light Gray winow panes.  We have never had Light Gray window panes before and due to the Lego color change, will likely never get them again.  The side walls of the shack are built using 1x3x5 Dark Gray bricks--a first (and last) time for this piece in that color.

So there are many new pieces in this set; some totally new, others in colors previously unavailable.  This set has some good pieces in traditional Light and Dark Gray and the rest of the colors are Black and Blue.  Only the big wedges on the Hovercraft are painted; the rest of the decorated parts are stickers.

I recommend this kit as a set and as good parts for original creations.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T22:59:01Z","Bad meat","This woild be a good set if the hovercraft was stronger and not so weak. I accidently dropped it and then I was screwwed because the pieces shattered into a heap of bricks. The minifigs are definitely funky and dirty but as crooks go, it couldn't be worse. Dock 13 needs more support because if there really was a hurricane, it would be like a cake hitting the hard cement.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:15:48.56Z","Floating hideout was my main appeal","The shed has big sliding doors, which I have rarely ever seen in any set. Not to crazy about the hovercraft although it is cool looking- don't know how useful it would be catching a jet ski. The hovercraft is large almost out of scale to most of my city vehicles,boats, etc. Due to its shelf space not one that I keep assembled. However the set does have some appeal, I am glad I do have it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
