The best thing about the set is definatley the little rescue inflatable, however it looks better without the &quot;water cannon&quot; on the front. Must note the new minifigs at last the brains?? atlego have joined the modern age of fire protection by giving them semi-luminous hoops on there tops. The faces are just weird. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

After assembling it, however, I've concluded that it's a fairly average vehicle that could have been better conceptualised.

The strong points of the kit are the smaller items of detail such as side-mounted and forward water cannons, communication aerials and computer terminals, and a storage locker located in the main crew compartment.  The smaller inflatable fire boat onboard is a nice touch as well.  When assembled the kit displays nicely, but does look like it's floating a bit low in the water.

The weak points of the kit are the juniorised cabin elements and rough edges along the sides and stern of the boat.  The biggest frustration I have is with the stern section of the kit which holds the inflatable   fire boat.  Instead of having a large plate to act as the bottom of the kit, there is nothing at all except a big hole when you remove the inflatable boat.  To me it looks silly and impractical, and all lego really needed to do was put in an 8X10 plate and finish the bottom completely.

I'm giving the kit a 3 out of 5 mostly because I didn't pay full rpice for it and despite it's drawbacks, it's still a nice display piece.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Secondly is about the rear section that fit in the inflatable life raft. It is unrealistic as the Command Craft will likely to sink if that opening for the life raft. But we had rebuild the rear section with mainly 4 plates 6X6 (ideal is 2 plates 6X12), moved the opening for the life raft to the very rear of the command craft. It had made it so realistic compared with the original. Added 4 accessory flame to the water jets (from Lego 7238 Fire Helicopter) to have a fire putting action theme into it. Configure the bed area to a working area without the bed but with some stands holding &amp; storing hand held tools. The total new parts we purchased for the reconfiguring add up to USD 20.00! 

How I wish that I can show you our end product here. Please feel free to contact me with your email address and we can forward to you some pictures. 

About this Fire Command Craft, it is the 2nd Lego Boat I own. It meant as a gift to me from my girlfriend. My first was the Lego 7899 Police Boat at a huge discount price of USD 20.00! I’m a Hotwheels collector not Lego and while shopping for Hotwheels, my girlfriend &amp; I found this retired model at a shopping centre during 2006. 2 years of shelf life and it is still unsold! We waited for 3 months because of the pricing and I dislike the rear section. After 3 months of consideration, we had finally decided to purchase it hoping it was still unsold! It is a decision we never regret and had started back collecting Lego and stopped Hotwheels. 

I would like to thank my girlfriend for footing the bills for me with this Command Craft and had bought back my childhood memories.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2007-11-22T14:55:27.077Z","Amazing Fire Boat","Well I got this set at TRU in 2005 and am really impressed. This is indeed my favorite world city set. Even the new boat doesn't match the standard. I especially like the minimal use of bulky pieces and the cannons. The flaws are minimal. Maybe the upper level cannons are not accessable to minifigs realistically, but that's it. A very good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-10T17:48:46.28Z","nice set, but no need for it","This is indeed a nice, realistic fire boat. It includes three fire fighters, sleek pieces, special boat pieces, control room, cockpit, bed, cup, computer, radar, axe, chainsaw, water cannons, mini boat and telephone. The mini fire boat can be stored at the back of the craft, and it doesn't fall when you lift the set up. Overall great set and reasonable price. Although this set is nice, my city doesn't need a fire boat.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-20T06:56:25Z","Wow lego","This is so  awesome.  This was my first real big set and still a favorite.  I liked these minifigures from the second I looked at the box on my 8th birthday and built it before school.  Lego did a great job on designing this ship.  My favorite parts are the cockpit and the water sprayers.  This is an all time favorite and has great pieces.  If you can pick up this set for a reasonable price, buy this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T08:06:06.327Z","Simply Awesome…","I had searched high and low for this set and looked everywhere for it.   I went into Toys ‘r’ Us and saw one left on the shelf.   I picked it up and it was an empty box!   The actual boat was on display in a glass cabinet and not for sale!   Anyway thanks to eBay I found one mint in box so that’s how I came to have this in my collection.   I have had many discussions about this set and it is still my all-time favourite set.   I doubt that it is actually based on any real fire fighting boats, but I could imagine something like this patrolling the harbours of New York, Hong Kong etc.   The first time I saw it was from the rear, and to me it looked like an oversize RIB (Rigid Inflatable Boat) and I thought how clever of Lego to adopt this style, if they even realised what they were doing with it!   Many of these RIBS are now being developed with cabins, control centres and used by various rescue organisations, how fitting that Lego should do the same.

I love the way that the boat sits low in the ‘water’ the trim is exactly right on it.   The colour scheme of red, white and grey looks great.   The outer lower cabin area is in white while the inner section of the lower cabin is in red, along with the bridge area.   The supports on the lower deck are also in red and support the bridge wings where the water cannons are mounted.   The funnel and radio-communications equipment adorn the top of the bridge and there is a large fire hose mounted on the forepeak.   

The cabin is easily accessible through an ingenious removal of part of the cabin top and houses a desk with communications centre, a sick bay area and an equipment locker.   There is also a coffee cup on top of the locker, I guess the crew needed their caffeine fix!

The skiff docks effortlessly in the rear docking bay which I am guessing is supposed to be ‘flooded’ so to allow the skiff to sail right in and moor up.   Each aft section hinges out sideways so that this procedure is made easy and then closed up and coupled back together when the skiff is secured.

This set is simply awesome, in my opinion, it works well with other sets of similar size and scale and has plenty of features that make this boat a real departure from the earlier sets.   I also like the cheeky grim of the minifig which is stationed on the forepeak!   

I don’t think this set can be improved at all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
