either way, perfect for this sort of set, or a pirate HQ ^_^

as for the pieces, they're pretty good.. lots of windows, and a creative use of that skateboard from Island Xtreme Stunts and the world city station(if you can't see, it's the radar)

an interesting, but limited function is the two mission panels, transparent pieces that can be inserted behind a transparent piece that displays a map... the result is a 'mission briefing' screen that could be used for rescue missions... too bad there's only a drowning person and a exploded boat mission

not that i personally am using most of the stickers... since i'm intending to use it as a base for my 'neo pirates'(take a wild guess), most of them won't be needed

as for an overview of the building, the lowermost floor has the aforementioned mission briefing screen, two terminal-looking things, and a hat rack that happens to have a third terminal on it(yeah, i know, it makes no sense, but...) the second floor has a pair of binoculars on a stand, a 'light', and another terminal... pretty boring

the third, is a spinny chair and a computer screen..

the stretcher-carrier thing is moved by a spinny piece at the top that is spun to raise it, and the whole unit can be  spun horizontally

as for the rest of it, you can see it there... the panel in front of the door is how you open the hidden containy thingy, there's a helipad and a dock, and a few other touches scattered around that aren't really worth mentioning

oh, and the life-saving floaty thingy is too high for a minifig, so it seems more suited to one of those evil 4juniors minifigs! evil! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I absolutely loved it, especially the helicopter. The set seemed so futuristic! I loved how they had a mini elavator. It was awesome. I put it together to my world city sets and I made so many adventures at sea. If anyone never owned a lego coast guard set, I highly recommend this one. You'll love it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T19:24:18Z","The Ultimate Base","The Watch is cool, the vehicles are awseome, and every little nudnik that likes water will love it! If I was you though, I would replace the regular helicopter, with the actual one in the other set. The set would be absolutely perfect if that tower would stand up strait and not fall, and replace that queery doctor with a rad head. 9/10 is the way to be with dis' set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-22T23:03:29Z","The perfect playset","I got this set for Christmas, an this set is so much fun. Just look at what's here:

On the outside:
1 helicopter,
1 speedboat with a stretcher,
a light that can swivel,
a baseplate that has two sets of stairs, and
a lif that works by turning a knob, which rases the lift to the 2nd floor of the tower(presumably, this is for raisng someone on the stretcher to the doctor's office).

Also, there is a tower which has three floors:
 -1st floor: This is the debriefing room, with 2 computers, a place to store equipment, and a debriefing sceen that has intechangeable missions.
 -2nd floor: This is the doctor's office, which has a computer and a table that has a mini microscope on it. Like I said before, there is a lift that goes up to this room, so patients can get to his office easily.
 -3rd floor: Tis isn't really a floor, but more like an air traffic control tower. It has a computer, a swivel chair and one lare window(made up of three windows)that surround the chair.

The set has 4 minifigs: a boat driver, a helicopter pilot, a doctor, an another minifig (I'm not really sure what he does; I normally make him the guy that needs to be rescued).
  
The only con is that the lift normally breaks. It doesn't really matter, though, as this set is worth every little penny.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-20T06:48:59.093Z","Watch the waters in lego city","This set is better than awesome.  It hasa chopper, an rescue boat, and a huge command centert.  It has 4 minifigs, a doctor, a chopper pilot, a boat driver, and a base comm.  The only thing missing is someone to be rescued./  Overall it is awessome get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JeremyWood","2009-08-12T13:44:49.42Z","Amazing Set!","This set is great! I got it for 20 or so dollars at Costco. Anyways, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:
Cool boat and helicopter
Lots of nice accessories
Several good minifigs
Great price!
Nice baseplate

Cons:
Elevator/lift thing is unstable
A whole sheet of stickers

Besides the two cons, this set is definately worth buying!
