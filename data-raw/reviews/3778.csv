"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-28T09:34:55Z","i know you'll all hate me for this but...","i kinda like this set. i stole his scimitar and gave it to a custom captain of rival pirates i will be creating. the lantern is cool, and the leaf isn't GROWING out of the raft. the chunky guy put it there so that the sun wouldn't beat down on his yellow hide. if you rearrange the catapult in a way that the figure can actually REACH it, then it works preatty well. i like the lantern, and the junior flag is going to be one of the flags of my rival pirates. however, i plan to give the raft to my new pirates and throw the clunky pirate overboard (aka stuff him in the grill when dad is serving my parents during the next cookout...).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legoman1993","2006-11-24T13:00:42Z","its  an ok set","   Goods : sliver sword , catapult piece ,leave piece , pole thing ,the light , brown roof pieces , Bads : pirate!!!    its only good for pieces!     If you can get it at a cheaper price!    The brown pieces can be used for roofs or something.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-13T11:16:30.5Z","I wouldn't trust this raft to get across a small pond","The raft could have been designed better. One must remeber these are aimed at 4-7 year old kids. Set retail price was around $5.00 US dollars, and it fit in nicely with the other 4 Junior Pirate sets we own. Catapult works well. Overall it is what it is, and who its designed for will enjoy it.

I got this set for about 1.00 so I'm not complaining. I really only use big-figs as bad guys fighting minifigs but it's good all the same. At first I thought this was a good theme until I saw it was for 4-year olds. It make a three because of basic and good design for a raft, silver sword(persian), and a pirate flag. I still play with it but reagular pirates would have been a lot better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-21T04:10:11.153Z","Shiver me timbers, I ain't no minifig!","For AU$5, this set is simply cool. I liked the chrome scimitar and also the raft. Actually, the raft design won't float in water because the base is like chain-link fence - there are many holes on it, although it could do well in a more modern, industrialized setting. The pirate flag is a nice touch - it's printed, which is good as I am sick of stickers. The catapult is not bad and you could fit it nicely into your Castle. The fig is completely useless, unless you have a young son or cousin to give them to. Overall, I think this set is very good except for the fig.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
