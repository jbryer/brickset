The two characters allow for interaction between goodies and baddies and make a great game with map found at http://cache.lego.com/2057/downloads/fourplus/pirates/map.pdf

I was randomly browsing through old Lego catalogues today and remembered getting this little set back in Christmas 2005. Being only 11 years old at the time I really enjoyed this set but it quickly became a lost memory.<div><br></div><div>The build was insultingly easy. If you are more experienced, you will get no satisfaction at all from building this set. Even a 4 year old can just look at the picture and slap the pieces together.<br><div><br></div><div>In this set, you get two pirates that are Jack-Stone style figures, plus lots of interesting accessories such as a rifle, clam, crab, parakeet, treasure chest, jewels, gold coins, palm tree, pirate flag, chain, barrel, and large oars and boat. The island simply consists of 1 large 12x12 brick, which is extremely disappointing as a more detailed island is preferred. However, this set was aimed at a younger age group so I am not surprised at the level of juniorization.</div><div><br></div><div>As a stand alone, there is not much playability to this set, it would be better alongside the other pirate sets. The boat can float on water, which is pretty interesting especially for little kids who may decide to play with their Lego during bath time.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this set is good only for the accessories but other than that it is pretty much nothing. The price for these sets were always ridiculous due to the large size of the pieces; this particular set cost $10. I would recommend this set to younger kids who are upgrading from Duplo, or to those who just want the accessories. Obviously Lego had stopped selling this a long time ago so if you want it you will have to go to eBay or Bricklink, but if I were you, I would not waste any effort doing that.</div></div>",TRUE,3,5,1,3,3
