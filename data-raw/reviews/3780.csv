However I was not into LEGO when the older Pirate sets were out. So we settled on a few of these sets. I do like them due to the theme, the do look good, and with alitte help from Dad my son can assemble alot of these sets. Would recommend to younger kids or serious  collectors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<h4>Overall:</h4><p>What can I say about this set? Well, if you are or you have a little boy, then you will like this. If you are older, stay clear of this set unless you are desperate for pirates and you really want to make a Treasure Island...</p><p>It also contains really big parts to speed up the build, and those ""4 Juniors"" minifigures! I like none of that!</p><p>Overall, I would only&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set to you if you are an infant or if you really want Pirate sets. If not, don't waste your money!</p>",TRUE,2,3,2,2,2
