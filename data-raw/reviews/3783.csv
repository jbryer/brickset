Not very many pieces, you can see its aimed for the 4-7 year old kids. Easy to build, except Dad had to help with the masts and sails. He loves it and with the other sets we have really has some high sea adventures.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Sure, this was a great set, but it lacked a bit. I turned it from an ages 4 and up set, to an ages 8 and up set. The space in the back that was used for storage, I made into a captain's quarters.
       Anyway, this was a great set and still is. Although $40 is a bit too much. It had a good group of figures and parts. Easy construction. Floats well. It should of included the motor the whole time. It isn't always gonna' be windy. It has the basic parts a ship should have. I'd say it WAS worth the choppy review I'm giving it. WAS, not IS. This ship is a lot like bread-it tastes dull by itself, but add a little butter,(or peanut butter, or jelly, or whatever you want, I don't care) and it tastes great!

"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-19T14:52:31.623Z","I turned it into a 10+ set for some reason","For little kids.  All I gotta say.

Pros:

-Treasure chest

-Fabric sails

Cons:

-Everything else

Meant for 4+, but I thought it would be cool.  No, it isn't cool, but a kid 4+ might like it.  Might?  No, he'll like it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"diehardlegofan","2011-02-09T09:34:52.11Z","From the Perspective of a Four Year Old","These sets are intended for ""4+"", so that's how I'm going to be reviewing them. &nbsp;However, I do believe this set could relate to ANY age. &nbsp;Most of my favorite pieces of all time came from this set. &nbsp;Such as:<br><br>The monkey.<div>The gate pieces.</div><div>The skull piece.<br>The map piece.</div><div>The swords.<br>The helm.<br>The anchor.<br>The poles.<br>The canon.<br>The boat pieces.<br>Those black pieces that make up the sides of the ship.<br>And the ropes.<br><br>Yes, even as a kid I was still a little disappointed at the size of the minifigures, but I'm not going to complain about them in this review. &nbsp;I do think they are a little cute. &nbsp;Like most 4+ sets, this has virtually ENDLESS playability. &nbsp;One of my favorite parts about this set was that you could take this in the bathtub with you and it wouldn't sink! &nbsp;If you thought that the boat was a little big, you could take out the middle piece and just attach the front and back to make it smaller! &nbsp;If you like building pirate ships without instructions this set is <b>ESSENTIAL</b>. &nbsp;I'm not even kidding. &nbsp;You'll love this set, and you'll <b>LOVE </b>the pieces that come with it. &nbsp;If you are a MOCer, this is a MUST HAVE. &nbsp;I HIGHLY recommend this set for any age.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Classic_Brick_Studios","2021-06-21T19:24:43.57Z","Sail away, sail away, sail away!","<p><em>Many rumours and stories spread about the lost at sea Captain Roger Redbeard, the most infamous cutthroat to ever sail the seven seas. But while he spent his vacation, drinking Tequila and writing down his story on Barracuda Bay, many imposters set sail on his ocean...</em></p>

<p>On request of lego_mini_fan, today I will review a set for you that I probably appreciate more than most, as it was a big part of my childhood.</p>

<p>To set a scene for you guys, the classic pirate era was over by 2001. That was obviously rather unfortunate, especially for a young pirate fan like me, so when LEGO released a pirate theme in 2004 I was all over it. Though I must say, that this ship actually wasn&#39;t on my wish list, but the Red Beard Runner 6289 was. I got this ship here instead.</p>

<p>We are in the dreaded Jack Stone era and these sets therefor haven&#39;t aged very well and many LEGO Fans hate on them for some right but also many wrong reasons. So now let&#39;s get into this high seas adventure and see if we can find any buried treasure, mateys!</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>We get none in this set. We do however get some kinda awkward looking figures in the same boat that Jack Stone was in. These figures, while far from perfect still look better than many off-brand minifigures even today. I would enjoy these guys as minifigures as their designs are pretty engaging and show quite an amount of character. My favourite must be the Scurvy Dog with the beer gut.</p>

<p>We also get a Redbeard imposter. How I can tell it&#39;s an imposter? Well he looks kinda sus, missing the iconic hook hand.</p>

<p><strong>The Pirate Ship</strong></p>

<p>Here we get to the downsights. This ship isn&#39;t exactly the finest design around, made up out of mostly really large element it misses the elegance of the pirate ships of old. It also lacks a captain&#39;s quarters.</p>

<p>I will admit though it has things going for it. For example, in comparison to other pirate ships LEGO did, this one actually floats really well, and I remember playing with it in the bath tub which was a lot of fun but wouldn&#39;t have been possible if this would fall apart in hundreds of small pieces.</p>

<p>The set has about everything you would need to have a little pirate adventure, however it is the level of detail that bothers me and most adult fans the most. I currently don&#39;t have my version build and the pieces are spread in massive boxes of unsorted bricks from my childhood. Maybe one day I&#39;ll rebuild it, though I don&#39;t really know what for any more. It is a fun toy for 4-year-olds but not much beyond that. It has to be mentioned though that I used the hull pieces to build a big exploration steam-vessel for my Adventurers which worked quite well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the sails, as I think the skull looks a bit too silly. However, when I was a kid, I found it funny, so I&#39;d say they achieved their goal.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the best ship around, but it also never tried to be. This was supposed to be a fun toy for kids, and I&#39;d say it succeeded and in some regards it even was better suited for play than the classic ships like the Black Seas Barracuda or Skull&#39;s Eye Schooner (those obviously have waaaaaaaaaay more display value, so don&#39;t hate me too much for saying this)</p>

<p>However, there isn&#39;t much building involved, which makes me question if it is a suitable LEGO product. LEGO itself is all about building but with what little parts we get here at the price point, it doesn&#39;t look too good. On the other hand it makes up for that with easy play, so in conclusion: A fun toy, but not the best LEGO toy. If your 4-year-old daughter or son loves pirates, you might want to get this on Ebay, as it won&#39;t run you a fortune, like the classic ships do. I think for being a fun thing for a kid it is really underappreciated.</p>
