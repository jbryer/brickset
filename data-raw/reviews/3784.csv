Pretty cool wine jug with the set, can always use another alligator in our LEGO town. Another Pirate to play or fight with the rest of our crew.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-06-16T23:47:48.403Z","blah","This is worse than the regular Pirates theme Lego made. The figures look too Jack Stone-like and the croc is smaller than the figure. Is the croc supposed to be bigger? I think so. This is only a 2 out of 5 and it needs work to be a 5.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

pros: crocodile
         jug thing
        cool sword


cons: its missing something...
         the prate looks a bit weird

overall   6/10
          
                     i would not recomend this to you but if you want
                   a crocidile and a cool jug i guess you should get it",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
