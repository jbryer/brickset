The pirate is not bad but he is a bit to large with my old pirates maybe he can be something like a giant pirate or so. The monkey and the brown round brick(2*2) are new brown, a little bit more reddish. The scimitars are good. Ther were 2 rubies or diamonds in this set. He was 3,49 euro, in other shops 3,99 euro. Maybe a little bit to expensive",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
