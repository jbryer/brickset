"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-10T09:18:34Z","nice li'l set for a nice li'l price, but that's about it...","First things first, it was no other movie than TPM that turned me into a Padawan into the Star Wars universe. before, I always thought that Star Wars was just like that other s-f story (please fellow SW fans, forgive me for even thinking that, 'trek' sucks) just some muttering guys on a space ship with little happening. But TPM drew my attention and all of that thanks to Darth Maul. He's just such a cool villain, doesn't say much but that's the whole thing. He doesn't impress with pretty lines to say, but totally blows your mind with that red/black face, the aggressive double-bladed lightsaber and those acrobatic moves of his. Unfortunately, the duel of the fates at the end was all that was good about TPM, plus that terrific pod race scene with Sebulba. So when Lego started with Star Wars sets for ep1 (the OT sets never drew my attention at that time, now they do thank goodness) i was crossing my fingers for a Darth Maul fig, and Lego didn't disappoint me... much. he was only included in the sith infiltrator set which totally sucked with the missing windows, controls and such. but i was desperate to get every Darth Maul figure out there, I definitely wanted the Lego Maul and was ready to buy it, when i discovered that there was another nice little set with wicked Maul, this one. and instead of a lousy ship i got a little cute speeder, another mini-fig and some kind of useless scenery backdrop, that i learned to be a moisture evaporator years later, when ep2 came out and i actually watched the OT to conclude that those rock the most!!!
finally, now onto the review

*i was never a big fan of Gui-Gon, but he was still decently cool and so is his mini-fig, the new hairpiece is nice, as is his face and i like him since I've only got one ep1 set (this one) and so this is my only Gui-Gon
*the speeder of Maul is kind of cute since it's so small and all but lacks almost every term of detail, its just a seat with a steer and something on the back, no details, no printed parts, nothing. Maybe the lack of printed parts makes other Lego SW fans happy, but i love printed parts. so the speeder was a disappointment, it's no more than a hovering seat for Maul to me, nothing sleek and agile that's very fast, like the movie
*the moisture evaporator has some detail thank goodness and is useful for Lego Tatooine environments (like the homestead or the outskirts of Mos Eisly) I guess. But including it in this set is just totally unnecessary and just raises the price. It's nice for backdrop, but not for this scene, so I built some kind of landing platform for the Maul speeder out of it, just to make it useful
*and now onto the Maul fig. Iâ€™ll say no more than: perfect!!!!!!!!!
Except for two things: his horns aren't moulded on his head (of course not, then his hood wouldn't fit) but his horns aren't painted on the head as well, which is a bit lame. Having Darth Maul without horns is like having a completely black Maul, a Vader without his helmet, an Emperor without force lightning, and so on. You can probably tell by now that the horns of Maul are a very important icon that, to me, makes Maul so evil and cool.
The other disappointment is that there is no second red saber blade included, Maul without a double-bladed saber is like... you got my point. i know why he doesn't have it, since he doesn't activate the second blade in that specific scene. but since there will never be a duel of the fates Lego set (if you listen Lego, please make it, and then with a horned Maul with double-saber, change nothing at Gui-Gon and give obi a new hairpiece with Padawan ponytail and braid) i kind of preferred to have a complete Maul useful for every scene. now i had to give him the two red translucent staves from the 'vleermuisridder', something of bat knight in Dutch, but i don't know the English name of that series, anyway, I used the two red staves from the bat knight (I've got two of him) and used those as Maul's saber blades. He looks much cooler now, not only because of the double saber, but also because of the rounded tips. Why Lego, why the heck are your saber blades cut off with a flat top, why not use those staff pieces with the rounded tops which resemble saber blades better, why? Ah well, I guess I'll customize my Lego Jedi &amp; Sith (got 7 of them) with those round staves myself

Rating:
The figs are near perfection and receive a 9 (despite the single Maul saber and the lack of horns)
The scenery just plain sucks for this set, use it for something else on Tatooine and the speeder is not detailed and sleek enough, receive a 3 together

However, I don't think it's completely necessary.  This set was for the minifigs.  Without the minifigs it would just be the speeder and the moisture evaporator in the backround.  And besides, any Lego with Darth Maul in it for only $6.00(USD) is a good deal.  Another complaint some people have is that Darth Maul doesn't come with a double-bladed lightsaber.  Darth Maul only using one blade in that scene is actually accurate to the movie.  Sure it would've been nice to get two blades, but I can settle for one.  Overall, a great set to reinact the Qui-Gon vs. Maul battle on Tatooine.

"ShatteredGnome","2009-10-06T21:02:58.53Z","A Classic Episode I Set","<p>This was one of the first sets that got me hooked on Lego Star Wars. Although its parts and elements are somewhat outdated, I still use them today and enjoy the figs and playability this set had to offer. For $5.99, I think this set was pretty good.</p>
<h4>Box and Instructions</h4>
<p>The set came in a very small box, probably half the size of the new Star Wars battle pack sets. The instructions are small as well, slightly smaller than the box when laid flat. Instructions were fairly easy to follow, but as in various sets, sometimes it is hard to distinguish colors (Gray from black, etc.).</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Featuring parts of various colors, such as dark and light gray, black, tan, and brown, the parts are color schemed to reflect the Tatooine environment. Some rare, special or handy parts are the grills on the vaporator, the antennae, and the tan 'chair' part and control stem on Maul's speeder.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The set comes with only two minifigs, which is a great deal, still. The first is Qui-Gon Jinn, and the second Darth Maul. Both have capes and lightsabers, with Qui-Gon's jedi robes and unique hairpiece, and Darth maul's all-black robes and hood. Both faces are well printed, and Maul can be reused with flesh colored figs if you want, because he is black and red faced. Both lightsabers are the same chrome handle; to date Maul's double sided lightsaber has not been made as a unique part. Also, this set only has one red blade.</p>
<h4>The Build</h4>
<p>This set is very easy to build; no problems there. For one of my first builds, it was good for a beginner or anyone who enjoys legos or Star Wars, for that matter. The moisture vaporator is not challenging but there's a few interesting simple methods that make it good for practicing. And Maul's speeder, while only a few parts, is slightly complex, with its one 'chair' part lending to this. Overall, not difficult at all to complete.</p>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4>
<p>The final model is good if you want a centerpiece or more for a display, or as a display in itself. It looks nice when together, and can be combined with other Episode I sets, or as a stand-alone playable set, because of the possibility for a 'lightsaber duel' between Qui-Gon and Darth Maul. I have to say, though, Maul's speeder is a bit too clunky and miscolored to be accurate. Oh well, it was in the beginning of Star Wars sets, though.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>While maybe not the greatest set ever, this small set gives you what you pay for, and is a great addition to any Star Wars collection. I'm not too fond of Episode I myself, but I found the set to have a lot of possibility, and it's the cheapest way to get both figs. Overall, an outdated Star Wars classic. They just don't make 'em this cheap anymore...</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); "">LEGO&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;is celebrating its thirteenth year as a LEGO franchise in 2012. As such, I&#39;d say it is time to review some of the theme&#39;s earliest sets, most of which I have from 1999 or purchased in the years afterwards. Starting this series of reviews, I wanted to go back and review a set that I did last year, and have now changed my thoughts on rather drastically. I present to you Lightsaber Duel from 1999.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>I really can&#39;t help feeling that the first couple years&#39; worth of&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;sets produced by LEGO were done rather hastily without much regard for the line continuing. I know that LEGO was suffering at the time and that&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;was largely responsible for pulling the company out of the hole, but the sets themselves were fairly unimpressive. In Lightsaber Duel, for example, the lightsabers, hood, Qui-Gon&#39;s hair, and the printing on the heads and torso were all new, but little else was. The set was...boring. There were no innovations that had not appeared in the standard Space theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Lack of Inspiration:&nbsp;</b>Being a boring set was a given. The set includes a fairly clunky and generic &quot;speeder bike&quot; which more closely resembles old Classic Space hover scooters rather than Darth Maul&#39;s&nbsp;curvaceous&nbsp;speeder. The only other accessory is a&nbsp;vaporator-type desert utility, that doesn&#39;t have any function other than aesthetic. And it&nbsp;looks very simple. Plus, Maul doesn&#39;t even have a second blade for his lightsaber.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>What It Got Right:&nbsp;</b>All that being said, the set got little right. Honestly, this little bit should have been included with a much larger Naboo Starship set. Without that, the only thing really going for the set was the advertising. With&nbsp;<i>The Phantom Menace</i>&nbsp;in theatres, most people could easily remember this scene: the first encounter of a Sith and Jedi in a thousand years. The box art shows the beautiful&nbsp;podrace-showcased features of the planet, and does a good job of it. The vaporator is rather a funny addition but does add to the aesthetic character, though the actual device can barely even be seen in the film. And though the bike looks terrible, at least LEGO included it. Not including it would have been much worse.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b>Future developments made this set not only obsolete, but sad. Newer versions of the&nbsp;<i>Sith Infiltrator</i>&nbsp;starfighter included increasingly better-looking versions of the speeder. The most recent model almost matches its curves, though still not precisely. The now-standard flesh-colored head is missing for Qui-Gon, though Maul doesn&#39;t need one. Maul&#39;s head, however, should be red with black tattoos rather than the other way around. The vaporator should have some feature, however silly, just to make it worthwhile. And Maul needs a second blade for his saber. Period.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Minifigure:&nbsp;</b>This set provided one important thing: a cheap way to get Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn minifigures. Darth Maul wears a generic black body suit with printed robes, a black hood, and a black cloth cape. His head is all black as well, with red facial tattoo printings on the front side. Qui-Gon wears traditional light Jedi robes, with brown pants and a brown cape. His head piece was and remains unique to his figure, with little braids of hair going over each shoulder. His face holds a stern expression with light brown eye brows,&nbsp;mustache, and&nbsp;goatee. Both figures were very well done for this first attempt and neither have changed significantly over the years.</p>

At the time, it was novel and cheap, but today it looks outdated and almost silly. Newer versions of Maul do away with the hood in favor of a better face printing with actual horns for his skullcap. Qui-Gon, too, has gotten some upgrades to his facial design and robes, though his hair remains the same. I still like the chrome-plated lightsabers that have gone in and out of style over the years. Ultimately, though, all of the components of this set have been released fairly recently in the&nbsp;<i>Sith Infiltrator&nbsp;</i>and Gungan Sub sets from early 2012. Skip this sad relic of 1999 and go for the new. I doubt you&#39;ll regret it.</p>

<p>I think a lot of reviews for this set are silly. People list a con as: should have included another blade for mauls lightsaber. Why? At this point in the film you hadnt even been shown that mauls saber was double bladed! And the 'silly tower' that is included is actually a moisture vaporator that is in the film, not some silly tower. So dont make silly critisicms people!</p>

<p>Obviously by todays standards this is a set that is lacking somewhat. But back in 1999 this was a pretty cool set, and was the only one I could get darth Maul in what with my allowance. It was very simple to put together, which at the time I liked because i hated to sit for ages constructing models, I just wanted to play. I liked the inclusion of a moisture vaporator and even today i feel privilaged that I am a minority who seems to actually realize what the tower is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can get ths set cheap, go for it, its not the best set ever, but its cool to have for nostalgic reasons, as I loved it as a kid. I won it off ebay for ten pound with P and P included. You get some cool old school minifigures and its generally a fun little piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pros: 2 minifigures</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moisture vaporator (i love lego wth scenery!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cons:&nbsp; The speeder looks a bit rubbish by todays standards. </p>

<p>overall this set does hold up to modern sets. Wish You could buy sets this cheap now!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5

He chose to give them to me. So I got to add this wonderful little set to my collection, sadly by then Maul had lost his Lightsaber blade and another piece was missing from the Moisture Vaporator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is good about this set? It is small, it was one of the cheaper sets and it comes with Qui-Gon and Darth Maul, one of only two sets released for Episode One back in 99 featuring the character of the Sith Apprentice. The other being the much costlier Sith Infiltrator Version One.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like all of my Star Wars sets, I think they are all great, even these older yellow Mini-Figure versions. There isn't much to construct in this set, Maul's speeder and a Moisture Vaporator, which wasn't in the actual scene this is intented to represent. The Mini-Figures are quite nice, Maul has a menacing looking face design and comes with a great looking torso. Qui-Gon gives us a fresh new hair piece design. And of course these earlier sets feature chromed Lightsaber hilts, which I find to be much better than the plain grey hilts LEGO has switched to with recent sets. The chromed hilts look more Star Wars, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that if you are a Star Wars enthusiast and a fan of LEGO then the LEGO Star Wars theme is certainly a great way to blend two great tastes that taste great together. Some think Maul should have come with two blades, but this scene is meant to depict his encounter with Qui-Gon on Tatooine, he only ever used one blade during that battle. So only having one blade isn't a detriment, if you can find this for a good price you should pick it up and include it in your Tatooine display. Also if you're looking for a Qui-Gon hairpiece to give to your Republic Cruiser pink skined Qui-Gon this is your best and cheapest bet, plus you get a Darth Maul for your troulbes too.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"LegoMunchy88","2011-08-08T09:28:53.423Z","My First Old LEGO Set.....","<p>Lego's Lightsaber Duel was my first older LEGO set, being that I got it off ebay in 2006 in it was released in 1999. I got this set not because it was old, but because it included Darth Maul. Then I became a fan of old LEGO and started to collect it. Yes, this is what started it all for me. This set was together completely, then torn apart. When it was rebuilt, it was complete, but a few pieces were the wrong color. Then, a few years later, I rebuilt it again, and, by this time, had some old gray pieces in new gray, and was missing Qui-Gon's hair and Darth Maul's torso. I used a hood for Qui-Gon and a Darth Sidious body for Darth Maul, and I had, once again, my Lightsaber Duel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>Darth Maul: He's Darth Maul, the best Star Wars fig, in my opinion. What else is there to say? Awesome head, good torso, and he's a Sith!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qui-Gon-Jin: Qui-Gon is also a good figure, though he pales in comparison to Darth Maul. He's a good person to duel him though, a was a cool Jedi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set consists of Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, a speeder, and a moisture vapor collector thingy. First off, the speeder, I remember when I first got this set and, being much younger, could never get Darth Maul in hi speeder. Now, obviously, I can,&nbsp;and he looks great in it. The moisture vapor thing adds some nice scenery and playabilty to the set, being that Darth Maul's speeder&nbsp;can crash into it, it can be sliced in half, and part of it can be forced at an opponent if you broke it off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, LEGO 7101 Lightsaber Duel is my favorite Star Wars set to date, but it begs for one thing: Anakin. Anakin was a very important character in this scene, even though he only ran off into the ship. But, since LEGO didn't make a Queen Amidala's Spaceship set, Anakin could stay with Qui-Gon and fight Darth Maul. Though, maybe I'm asking for too much out of a set that was once ten dollars. </p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-21T06:02:13.713Z","A good cheap way to get Maul and Qui-Gon.","<p>In summer of 1999, LEGO's second round of Star Wars sets, based on The Phantom Menace, hit store shelves. This was the first in the lineup, featuring one-movie wonders Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul. Both are nicely detailed, reasonably accurate representations of the characters in LEGO. Maul's head could have perhaps been done as red with black printing rather than the other way 'round, but LEGO was not ready to produce heads in that color at the time. His horns are printed, but having alternate headpieces was completely unheard of at the time and LEGO felt it was important to furnish him with the hood that covers his head through most of the film.</p><p>Accompanying Darth Maul is his ride, the Sith speeder dubbed ""Bloodfin"". It uses two tan pieces and one brown piece in addition to the dark gray. Which is alright; the speeder in the movie was entirely dark gray save for the backrest cushion, but it was kind of a mottled gray. This was LEGO's way of depicting said mottling. The use of the old ""seat with slot for jetpack"" piece here was clever, giving the appearance of a seat while allowing the speeder to have a back. The model captures the basic shape well enough, and honestly if you absolutely cannot stand angularized approximations of curves, you shouldn't be playing with LEGO.</p><p>There's also a bonus bit of scenery, a somewhat blocky moisture vaporator. While no vaporator was in the scene, some are seen in the movie, and it's nice to have some extra Tatooine scenery. It's nicely detailed, with knobs and condenser panels. Not bad for something thrown in because there wasn't enough non-minifig weight for this to qualify as a set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Cheap. The MSRP was a mere $6.<br></li><li>Includes the two cool characters from the movie near-universally latched onto, in one neat little package.<br></li><li>Includes a decently-designed model of Darth Maul's speeder, which can be broken up for useful parts should you have an extra.</li><li>The moisture vaporator is a nice bonus, something to give your LEGO Tatooine a bit more detail. It makes a nice companion piece to 7110 or any other iteration of Luke's landspeeder.</li><li>Qui-Gon and Darth Maul's bodies can be used to make generic Jedi and Sith (or Sith wanna-bes). Given that this was a $6 set, there was army-building potential in abundance.</li><li>Both minifigs have good accessories (Lightsabers, capes, hood). The black hood and cape are extra-nice because they can be lent to the Luke Skywalker from the first Desert Skiff set.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only one red lightsaber blade. It may be film-accurate, but the second blade would have been useful as a spare. I understand why they did it, of course; It was extra incentive to buy the bigger, expensive Sith Infiltrator set. Ergo, I'm not knocking this set much for this one.<br></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, a great set for the time. It was an alternative, cheap way to get Darth Maul rather than making it so that in order to get him you had to choose between one of two big expensive sets. The moisture vaporator is useful for scenicking, the speeder's nice, and the minifigures are great both as themselves and as custom material. If you can find the set for cheap, I think it's still worth picking up. I'm happy to have received mine back when they were still making it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
