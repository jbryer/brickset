"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-21T15:02:26Z","no issue with the crane folks, this is one of the best sets i have!!!","this is positively one of the best lego sw sets i have, i don't have much, but still, this is at the top. and all thnx to that li'l green long-eared muppet we've all come to know as the greatest jedi to have ever lived.
and that made me wonder, why is yoda such a great jedi, sure he is wise and can raise x-wings out of a swamp, but he never proved himself in battle. i'm so happy he actually reached for his saber in ep2 and showed us what a great fighter he was!
and this mini-fig is just as awesome as the fight yoda vs dooku was, the head, the newly printed torso, i love it, 

same goes for dooku, he may look a bit plain with his almost completely black suit with little wrinkles, but that's just like the real dooku, his cape, great headpiece. the beard! much like sean connery as king richard, you can use this head plus a long wizard beard for lotr saruman perfectly. (duh!)
i just don't like that generic hairpiece that comes with way too many figs. he should have come with a new slicked back hairpiece that could double count for count dracula hair, or maffia hair (hint hint!)

dooku's saber surprised me, after getting darth maul from the lightsaber duel set (check out my review), with just a generic saberhilt, i thought dooku would have a generic hilt too. but it's actually curved and has other details that definitely make this dooku's saber.

the speeder is awesome! i used it for a race scene with anakin's swoop from the tusken raider encounter (reviewed that one too) they look very neat next to each other. there is only one thing i don't like... and like at the same time. the sand-blue colour. hello!!! this thing is supposed to be copper with grey, which could have been turned into brown or orange with grey for the lego version, why the heck is it blue? ah well, on the other hand, his speeder looks very neat in sand-blue, it's just, as a dedicated sw fan, i'd like to see a accurately coloured speeder, though this colour is also fine.

now onto that weird crane thing. i forgive lego with all of my heart for keeping the crane in this set even after it was replaced with that collapsing pillar in the movie (the one that dooku uses to crush ani and obi, so he can escape while the greatest and greenest hero of them all saves obi and ani) sure, it looks way too small to crush two mini-figs, but since it's a pillar in the movie, i suggest you build the pillar yourself and use this crane for yoda to hang on while in the middle of a jump (thnx griggy &amp; johnny 430 for the great display tip)

so all and all this set is just perfect!!! these tiny flaws are completely forgivable, although... it would be even better if they had replaced the crane with obi and ani + their sabers and save the crane for maybe a geonosian droid factory set with a padm&#233; mini-fig in her hot white jumpsuit.
pleeze lego!

may the force be with you... always

I like Yoda in the movies but in lego, he just looks too artificial. Yoda has my favorite kind of light sabre, the neon green. It always seem to glow, so it slightly looks as if it is on! The little gadget that falls is kindof corny but can be used a nice trap for other things such as castles or anything else. Count Dooku's sleek blue Z-60Z Speeder bike is very nice. It is great but isnt quite compatible to the other speeder bikes acoording to the looks. Its more like a luxury zoomer! Count Dooku is a nice evil looking head and his occasional dark side red sabre. One thing that I dont get is that count dooku's head is right in front of the speeder's engine intake. I mean, either his head would block the airflow around it or his head would be sucked into it!

It was only fitting that their encounter on Geonosis would be featured as a charming little Lego set.  My mom got me this set way back when it came out, and it sat in my old closet for the longest time before I began collecting Star Wars legos.  When I realized it was there, I was thrilled to bring it home and officially add it to my collection.

Featured is Dooku's speeder bike which he uses to flee the chaotic battle that ensues after the Jedi arrived on Geonosis.  Overall, it's a decent little speeder, with an interesting light blue color scheme.  Scale-wise, it is a bit big compared to the movie, but that is a minor complaint.  Besides, you don't get this set for the speeder. 

Also included in this set is a little industrial crane of sorts.  Not sure if it is supposed to be that piece of machinery that Dooku topples with the Force to distract Yoda long enough to escape.  If anything you could use it for the extra parts.

Now on to the main reason you buy this set:  the great minifigs!
Dooku is well represented here with a simple black torso with small details like a cloak clasp around the neck.  His brown cloak stands out against his dark atire, harkening back to his former life as a Jedi.  Most important, though, is his signature curved-hilt lightsaber.  It's just awesome and one of a kind.  Compared to the sets now, the yellow skin is nostalgic, but definitely sticks out with the newer figs and their peach hued skin.

"Zacherano","2009-11-28T21:28:36.607Z","Rare, Detailed Minifigures; Questionable Set Design","     Despite some questionable set design and coloring, I think that the two extremely rare and valuable minifiugres in this set more than compensate for the other pieces themselves.  I am dismayed to see my fellow Lego fans going so far as to compare the Clone Wars Dooku and Yoda to these classic figures - although the Clone Wars minifigures are fairly movie-accurate, they in no way match up to the classic designs.  I personally am not a major fan of Clone Wars, as I think it undermines the more important and interesting classic movies and is repetitive and geared at young children (though I admit that when I am bored I sometimes find an episode to watch on the Star Wars official website).  The Clone Wars figures, however, are less detailed than the classic minifigures, and the appearance is somewhat unappealing - I am shocked to read that others no longer accept the class Dooku and Yoda, two of the best classic minifigures in my opinion.  
    I have spent a great deal of money and time in purchasing Yoda and Dooku, although I do not possess the accompanying speeder bike and other Geonosis contraption (the name escapes me, if it has one).  I am very impressed with the detail on both of these figures, which are uncannily movie-accurate and contain discontinued chrome lightsabers to boot.  Count Dooku's curved lightsaber is rare and well-designed, while he comes with a cloak in Jedi brown!  Yoda not only sports a custom molded headpiece in a pleasing shade of green, but the back of the figure is just as detailed as the front!  Both of these minifigures proudly stand in the center of my display case.  In addition, when the set is sold as a whole, the figures are far cheaper.  

In conclusion, I plea to other Lego collectors to not disregard the classics - in 2011, Lego's Lucasfilm license will most likely be revoked, as it has already been renewed, and the classic minifigures and designs are extremely worthy for the most part. In the form of Lego, Star Wars will never truly die, even if Lucas never gets around to publishing future episodes! Thanks for reading my lengthy review. :-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I never knew what to make of the old minifigs whose heads were molded, like jar jar and the ewoks, as they were all one colour and looked like a piece of plastic, not a character, but yoda was&nbsp;done pretty well. What could have been improved was some sculpting to the back of the head so as he had some hair, but I realise the more recent CW version has done this. Dooku is pretty cool looking, very simple, but deffinately a good representation of a lego Cristopher Lee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parts</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This set has&nbsp;one very unique piece,&nbsp; the curved lightsaber hilt. As far as I am aware, this is the only set to have a curved hilt like this apart from the CW set with dooku in it. The speeder bike is a nice touch, I think the colourings&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;off, like not screen accurate, but it does work. The crane on the other hand is totally pointless, as it does nothing! I think lego only put that in so they could bump up the price.

But its a fairly cheap set so I cant complain too much! This is a&nbsp;good set if you want someone to lead your sepparatist droids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In all, deffinately worth geting if you can find it cheap&nbsp;enough, as I prefer this dooku and yoda to the clone wars ones.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-01T12:50:26.89Z","Begun this Clone War Has.","<p>Set #7103 Jedi Duel: When Episode II was first released there were a number of brand new LEGO sets introduced in the Star Wars theme. Among them was this little gem of a set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jedi Duel feature two buildable items, Count Dooku's speeder and a small piece of equipment used to simulate the scene in the climax of the film when Yoda had to save Anakin and Obi-Wan from a falling piece of equpiment. This LEGO version is much smaller than the piece seen about to crush our intrepid heroes in Episode II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is simple and straight forward to build both of these two items. Two mini-figures are included, yellow faced Count Dooku and of course Yoda, the venerable Jedi Master. Both Mini-Figures are nicely done, and they both included chromed Lightsaber hilts, this set was the first one to introduce the Dooku Lightsaber. It can be stored on his speeder also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this is a nice set worth having, it gives you a cheap and easy to build speeder, some rare Mini-Figures and the rare Dooku Lightsaber curved hilt. If you can find it for sale at a decent price and don't yet own it I highly recommend picking it up, since this is the only set featuring Count Dooku without the Clone Wars animated look to it. Yes, Count Dooku is a Mini-Figure that should be revisted in the new style without the Clone Wars animation style. Perhaps in a special anniversary set for Episode II, or perhaps the upcoming Battle of Geonosis set might include an updated version of the original Dooku Mini-figure.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"The_Reviewer","2011-09-05T16:02:17.97Z","Better than the clone wars","<p>I got this set when I was seven,I foolishly took it apart and lost the minifigs.But with the miracle of downloadable instructions I was able to find the printed pieces and soon I re-built it.(I got the minifigs back&nbsp;on amazon)</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is small and nothing special</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>the curved lighsaber is rare and unique , and&nbsp;the speeder has printed decals(Which just keeps getting rarer and rarer) </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The Count dooku (aka Darth Tyrannus) is exclusive and is Waaay better than the ugly clone wars one.(He has a cape, a dark cloke and yellow skin) The yoda is more attractive than the hideous cw one (He has a tan robe,short legs, and back printing.)</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>It was hard to find the pieces in my old bins; so it was challenging, but if you buy this set new and sealed with all the pieces; it's no problem.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The speeder is innacurate to the film (it's brown not blue), but still is very sturdy and looks good. the wierd crane is fragile&nbsp;and whenever I lift it; it separates which is a pain.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>If you like star wars&nbsp;and you hate the clone wars than this is your kind of set. the only con I can see is how the crane separates if you lift it. You can find this set on amazon/ebay.&nbsp;&nbsp; -thanks for reading</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"PhallingPhantom","2017-05-22T00:34:05.25Z","Phantom Reviews - Jedi Duel","<p>What a good&nbsp;set. The set is small, but contains some iconic minifigs and vehicles. I like the fact of Dooku&#39;s speeder bike. A great rendition of this iconic vehicle. The brown load thing (sorry, forgot what it is) is a terrible thing to put in this set. I could be something better, like the pipe like thing that almost fell on Obi-Wan and Anakin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is offers for vehicles/builds - 3.2/5</p>

<p>Now the minifigures. It offers Count Dooku, palpatines&nbsp;Sith&nbsp;Apprentice. It has a good style for it&#39;s time. The classical Yellow skin is his tone giving it the nostalgia. He has his great curved lightsaber. He is my favorite Dooku out of the current 3. Now Yoda. The first Yoda looks great for it&#39;s first model. It has his strange ears and great detail. It even has backprinting, unlike the CW version. He has his awesome green lightsaber.</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- 4.5/5&nbsp;(Could use an Obiwan or Anakin)</p>

<p>Over all - 4.2/5</p>

<p><b>Good Set</b></p>
