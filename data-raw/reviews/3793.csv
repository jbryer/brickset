PLUS:
*Some nice pieces
*Nice minifigs (if you havent got them)
*If you get more than 3 and some guards (included in more modern sets) than you can make that great scene from Ruturn Of The Jedi

MINUS
*No guards or Lando
*A bit underscale although so is every Lego set
*Luke has a Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi face

We all know that the real Desert Skiff had lando, guards, and was bigger than this, and that Luke is too abundant in the SW range, but come on, people!  This set has just-unfrozen HAN!!  When you combine it with the 2003 jabba's palace sets, it really starts to shine, and you can fully re-create the Tatooine scene from ROTJ.  That said, the vehicle is a little half-baked looking. I added the Gammorrean guard from Jabba's Prize, and now my Skiff looks  A LOT better. Why was this set out of production when Jabba's Palace introduced?  Worth getting just for han.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It has only three downsides:
Lando Minfig missing?
No guards
Not big enough

Though all of the above is true it is great for a set and it is a really cool small set. Heck, forget what I said on other posts about my favourite small set I love em all.

You get the Han Solo with a cool, plain outfit and the dark Luke (Dark Clothes)! I wish it came with a Lando Calrissian or one of Jabba's alien goons. The spiff is cool to be attacked and destroy, quite easy to break! You get two super minifigs but I think you can get enough Lukes elsewhere. This is a very nice set and has some nice pieces.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-18T17:43:06Z","missed opportunity on some great figs, good set on it's own","Let's get this right out in the open: don't expect to find a Skiff loaded with figs, like it was in the movies. Nope, we only get post-carbonite Han and Jedi Luke. Fear not, for including Boba Fett and the Gammorean Guard from Jabba's Prize already makes this Skiff a much better looking vehicle. Had Lego included these figs with the Skiff, it would have been more expensive, and people would be complaining about figures appearing one too many times and having a huge army of Lukes, Bobas and R2s. Lego could have included scene-specific figs to this set however, like Lando and some Weequays and other guards. They would have been exclusive to this set and therefore, Lego could have made a better set while still avoiding supplying tons of the same guy in all sets.
Han is nice, dressed in his plain white shirt and armed with a spear. I like his crooked smile, which is quite appropriate of Harrison Ford's character. I like Jedi Luke in this set much better than in Final Duel II, since the Jedi garb is appropriate for this scene, unlike the scene at Endor base, where Luke only wears the black jumpsuit without the Jedi vest over it. I like the fact both his hands are yellow, instead of having one black hand. Yes, he wears one black glove in RotJ, because he got shot in his robotic hand during this fight and the blast burned through the latex skin of his bionic hand, so he covered the hole with the glove. But he wears this glove after the whole Jabba sequence, since he doesn't have time during the fight to put it on. That's why this Luke has two yellow hands. nice attention to accuracy and detail, Lego! He comes with his green lightsaber as well.

Now onto the Skiff. I must keep reminding myself that this set is a little on the old side compared to the ep2 sets, so there is less detail and there are no printed pieces in the set. However, what's there is a quite accurate representation of the real Skiff and i like the fact it has a flat deck, which can fit a bunch of figs. It's on the small side however, so there won't be much that fits on it. I now have it displayed with the included Luke and Han, along with Boba and the Gammorean and it's already quite crowded. If Lego is ever gonna make the Sail Barge, this set will be much more appreciated that it is now.
it's got my respect, but that may have to do with the price I paid for him. I bought him with the Droid Starfighter on clearance at the local drug store together for only 11.40 euros(13.82 dollars) great deal, nice vehicle, good figures. can't go wrong.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-20T20:00:55Z","Desert Skiff","This is a nice set for the price range, but personally I feel Lego could have done better by making it bigger and selling it for an extra AU$5-10. But still it captures the likeness of it's movie counterpart and was a good way to get Han in a cheap set. I find it funny that Luke has Obi-Wan's Phantom Menace head, but I'm not complaining since back when this set was released it was an easy way to make your own Obi-Wan without the hood if you never bought the Gungan Sub.

This set comes with Han Solo who has a spear and Luke Skywalker who has his black jedi torso and his green lightsaber. Actually this lightsaber is translucent yellow but it looks like LEGO changed that in the 2011 summer sets. This speeder doesn't have many play features but it's very easy to maneuver this vehicle around. The ramp is a little bit too small for a minifig to walk around and we also don't get Jabba's guards, Chewbacca or Lando Calrissian who had been in this scene in this set.<br><br>I also love the design of the instructions where you get a picture of a scene from the Star Wars movies on each page.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-14T13:04:11.07Z","I thought you were blind!","<p>Set #7104 Desert Skiff: Year two of LEGO Star Wars gave us many interesting new sets among them one from Return of the Jedi depicting a scene from close to the beginning of that film.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The titular Desert Skiff is admittedly an older take on this vehicle in LEGO form and does have a few minor problems. For one thing it is a tad on the smallish size and for another it only includes two Mini-Figures, but it is still an impressive and fun little set to build and play with. My only wish is that LEGO would have introduced the Double-Sided heads earlier on so they could have included a Han Squinting with eyes shut and a Han with eyes open head for this set. (Have they even gone and done that yet???)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building it doesn't take too long, and as I said before the vehicle is still amusing to play with or just add to the Great Pit of Carkoon Display on your LEGO Star Wars shelves. The Mini-Figures are nice too and include Luke as a Jedi Knight without glove and Han Solo, back in the day he was a rare figure to come by. In fact this plus the Han from Echo Base and the Han in Carbonite (Technically) are the only three LEGO Han's I own because of that fact. He looks nice too even with the yellow face, his brown pants and open white shirt are nice pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set to anyone who's looking for more pieces to build up a truly impressive Great Pit of Carkoon display, as a bonus you'll have another chromed Lightsaber hilt as opposed to the flat grey tone LEGO has stuck with for the past number of years and for some reason Han is holding a coveted Black Spear. If you can find it at a good price don't hesitate to snap it up. The rare brown elements in the set alone which make up the sides of the skiff are worth the cost of investment.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2013-12-23T17:59:57.56Z","Good Desert Skiff for the time - and price.","My dad got this for me back in 2000; I was a very happy boy that day. 
The battle at the Great Pit of Carkoon was one of my favorite Star Wars 
scenes, and so having a set of one of the skiffs (That included a Return
 of the Jedi Luke to boot!) was a delight.<br><br>The skiff is very 
simple, as in the movie. The colors never looked off to me; still don't.
 The pieces used do a very good job capturing the shape, although it's a
 bit small (Though granted, four-stud-wide one-seater cars were still 
the standard at this time). Making it six studs wide would have given 
more standing room, but I understand why they didn't; the slope pieces 
necessary to do the nose at that width didn't exist yet. The boat/space 
windshield piece used was a clever touch; it captures, in angularized 
form, the nose of the skiff without cutting down on standing room (which
 was already at a premium) very much. I have unfortunately lost this 
piece on mine, and the crude substitution I had to make is no match. The
 gang-plank, a 1x8 tile, is a bit narrow and tricky to get a minifigure 
to stand on, but it's in proportion to the rest of the set, and it being
 a tile makes it easier for Luke to hang onto. The tan 2x2 round bricks 
on the bottom serve two purposes: Giving the appearance of hovering over
 a sandy surface, and serving as the magnetic lifters that picked up R2 
and 3PO (Though a Technic axle-pin hybrid or 1x1 pin would be needed for
 3PO).<br><br>As for the figures.. We only get two, but that's good for 
the price. Including Lando as well would have been nice, but he was 
still in minifigure limbo at the time (LEGO was hesitant about moving to
 using flesh tones, but at the same time didn't want to end up being 
racist by making a Lando with the same ""Skin tone"" as everyone else). We
 get Luke, now using the same face as the Episode 1 Obi-Wan figures to 
represent his ROTJ serious face, and in his black Jedi tunic and pants. 
His hands are both yellow, but that's actually accurate given when in 
the movie this set takes place. The synth-flesh on his prosthetic wasn't
 damaged until partway through this battle, and he didn't pull a glove 
over it until after taking off for Dagobah in his X-Wing. He is armed 
with his awesome green lightsaber, ready to slice his way through 
Jabba's thugs. This was the only set to have him at the time. Also 
included is Han Solo, sans vest (as per the movie) and armed with a 
black spear, which LEGO felt fit the proportions of the vibro-axes in 
the movie better than their poleaxe piece. Chewbacca was still exclusive
 to 7190 Millennium Falcon at the time of this set's release, so I don't
 mind him not being in it. Skiff guards would have been good, but that's
 asking a bit much of the price. There may have been a Sail Barge set 
being designed at the time that got scrapped later; I don't know. <br><br>Overall,
 a very nice set to have. Would I recommend getting? Yes, if you want an
 old-style ROTJ Luke and can find it for close to the original MSRP. 
Certainly I wouldn't recommend paying $30 like I've seen some eBay 
listings priced for.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
