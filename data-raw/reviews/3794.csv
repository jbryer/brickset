"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-06T07:08:47Z","Look Sir, DROID","This set is wicked and is was the first set I got C-3PO and R2 in. I liked the set but I relised there isn't much you can do with it. It can be used to recreate the scene at the beginning of episode 4 on Tatooine combined with Mos Eisley Catina and the Millennium Falcon.
Pluses:
*R2
*3PO
*Good for combining with other episode 4 tatooine sets

Minus:
If your like me I now have 4 3PO's and 3 R2's.
The interior lacks of detail.
Overall it is a cool set and if you want to get 3PO and R2 cheap I recommend this set to you.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-01T15:40:14Z","Not my kind of set!","     This is a fine set, but it has nothing valued in it. The escape pod is by far the best thing. It is round and looks good. I hate the way C-3P0 looks, I always have. The R2-D2 is fine just like any other one. I must say that this would be alot better if it had a Sandtrooper on a dewback. 
I really think they should make a lego Jawa desert walker!!!!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

But actually, it took quite a while.  And that's not because there were a lot of pieces, it's because it kept falling apart.  The curved pieces on the pod are very nice, but they do fall off if you're not careful.  But in fairness, the minifigures are great.  You get C-3P0 which you gotta love and you get the classic R-2.  Overall, a nice little set with a pod that looks pretty good when it's completed.  4/5 ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The details of the set are cool, like the head of C3PO, different in comparision with the normal heads, and of R2 D2, made easily. The building included is only the capsule where the droid escaped. This have simple details like the printed images on it, but the upper part remembers in the movie. It don't have much playability due to the size, but is eay put the droids in the capsule, and it is a feature to this set without much additions.

Pros- 
Cheap

"AFOSL","2010-03-29T12:14:06.7Z","A Nice Little Set For The Collector","Droid Escape is one of those Lego kits that has a charm of it's own despite it's short comings.&nbsp; It has a lot of the hallmarks of many of the early Star Wars sets, and I am a little surprised to see this kit was released as late as 2001.&nbsp; <br>It reminds me of kits such as 7110 Landspeeder released in 1999, and compliments that set nicely.&nbsp; Both kits contain a similar number of bricks, are quick and easy to build, and are a cheap way to obtain minifigures based on major characters from the Star Wars movie.&nbsp; Whereas the Landspeeder contained old Ben Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, Droid Escape naturally contains C-3P0 and R2-D2.&nbsp; This kit marks the fourth appearance of the R2-D2 minifigure, but it is only the second outing for C-3P0.&nbsp; Threepio was only ever available as part of a much more expensive kit at the time; 7190 Millennium Falcon, released in 2000.&nbsp; For a child on an allowance or people with a stringent income, unable to afford more expensive sets, Droid Escape would have been a very welcome set indeed, finally bringing the Threepio minifigure within reach of a wider audience.&nbsp; Both Threepio and Artoo are charming renditions, Threepio in particular being a faithful design, with a new head mould and nicely printed torso with markings front and back.&nbsp; C-3P0's colour in the early Star Wars sets was of a much lighter colour than later renditions.&nbsp; Artoo's early design is also different from his new look.&nbsp; For ten years (1999 - 2009) Artoo's head consisted of a white dome with only the top half being printed accordingly.&nbsp; This never seemed to matter, as having a Lego rendition of R2-D2 was more important than his design...&nbsp; Until the new, improved design appeared towards the end of 2008.Whichever way you look at it, having both droids in such an inexpensive kit was a real bonus for any collector.<br>The pod itself is very simple and, once you subtract the number of elements it takes to build a minifigure, contains a mere 37 pieces.&nbsp; Even the instruction are simple and are printed on both sides of a single sheet of paper - 13 stages in all, not including the assembly of the droids.&nbsp; The escape pod consists mostly of four large quarter cylinder pieces, only two of which are printed, which seems a little odd, and perhaps, tight on Lego's part.&nbsp; The decision not print on all four pieces may have been down to costs or maybe down to overall design, meaning that there is more variety of elements contained in the kit.<br>Like most of the early Star Wars sets, there are a number of brightly coloured elements used during the construction, but most of these are hidden, and more realistic colours - greys and white - are used on the pod's exterior.&nbsp; Four small cones are used to simulate directional thrusters - two on top and two at the bottom of the pod, and one large cone piece used underneath the pod as a main thruster or exhaust unit.&nbsp; Unlike the pod in the movie, there is no window, so the droids are unable to look at the devastation they left behind.&nbsp; The inside of the pod contains no hidden features, in fact it's completely empty.&nbsp; This does mean that there is plenty of room for the droids to rattle around in, but a small storage cupboard or some kind of survival kit would have been a nice, if not logical addition to the set.&nbsp; After all, an escape pod would normally be used by organic life forms, not droids, so should be fitted with such ancillary items.<br>Overall, 7106 Droid Escape is a nice little set, but seemed to serve no function in it's day other than to get the droids into an inexpensive set so that more people were able to acquire them.&nbsp; And although based on quite a memorable moment of the film, I can't see the re-enactment of a pod falling through space being of much interest to a child.&nbsp; Playability, therefore, is minimal.Like the Landspeeder, this set will still interest the serious collector, but may not be much sought after by a child, especially now that the droids are available in so many other sets, and have also been improved upon.&nbsp; For me, this set is a part of Lego Star Wars history, and my collection just wouldn't be complete without it.",TRUE,4,4,2,2,4
"Kalhiki","2010-05-27T22:22:26.67Z","A cute little pod","<p>Now, I don't know how much this costs. $10 is the most I'd pay for it if you ask me, but that's even going a bit high.</p>
<p>Building experiece seems pretty easy. I got this a long while ago, so I don't remember much. Let's just say I'm able to build it without the directions.</p>
<p>As for Minifigs goes, you get the droids. These are iconic figures, so I'm not going to go into much depth because mostly everyone should have them. You have C3-PO who looks very close to the movies. He also has a very nice and detailed head mold. R2-D2 is also nice, but he doesn't have the third foot as usual. Despite this he does have nice printed on detailing that is a good representation to how he looked in the movies.</p>
<p>The parts are good. You get the nice rounded wall pieces, and some have printed on detail. Nowadays, we all know it'd probably be a sticker. There are also nice engine pieces and, of course, the droids themselves.</p>
<p>Playability... there isn't much to say. It's a pod, so there isn't much you can do with it without another set (probably the cantina). I have lots of fun with this set mainly because I've memorized how to build it, so I can crash it and make it blow up. But other than that, there isn't much.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not you should get it. You don't have to. If you're a completionist, then yes. If you want the droids, get this because you also get a nice little pod. But I'd say pass on this If you want to get an older Star Wars set...</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-12T11:33:02.717Z","We Seem to be Made to Suffer, it's Our Lot in Life","<p>Set #7106 Droid Escape: A New Hope time. I picked up this set cheap back in 01 or 02 and I was not dissapointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Droid Escape is a cheap fun little set that gives you C-3PO and R2-D2, two coveted Mini-Figures in any LEGO Star Wars collection. You also get to build up the escape pod from the Tantive IV. The escape pod doesn't use very many pieces, but it gets the job done of depicting this particular vehicle/vehicle accessory in your LEGO display. It offers up printed pieces instead of stickers for the details and is fairly straight forward. Although there isn't much to be done with this set as far as gimmicks are concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R2 is R2, the same Astromech pieces we've all come to know are used in his construction. 3PO is not gold, but he is impressive and unique looking and includes a double-sided torso.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set is nice, it's not blow your mind awesome, but it does offer up a cheap alternative to buying the more expensive sets to get the two droids. Of course if you don't have it yet, but already have both droids then there's really little point to adding this set to your display unless you are strongley influenced to be a LEGO Star Wars completist. It is a fun little set, but not necessarily a must have for the more casual LEGO Star Wars fans.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

Once completed, I was actually quite happy with the end result.
