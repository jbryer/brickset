This is smaller and comes with the good figures. It comes with aged Obi-Wan and Tatooine Luke.  The front is way more blocky than the new one and it doesnt look as fancy! It is an old color scheme, this is a light tan color, the new one is raw brown, and the pieces in this one dont compare to the newbie! One outstanding pro for this set is that you can get a landspeeder as one set, and not pay 30 duckets for the Mos Eisley cantina, but if you take my opinion into notice, if you have the dollars, go for the new cantina one, it looks faster and is alot more modern looking.

Luke even comes with a blue lightsaber! The newer land speeder is much cooler, but you don't have to pay so much money for this set. The engine pieces and the windshield are okay and a nice addition to my collection. Unfortunitely, more thought could have been put into this set, especially since all of the focus of this set was put directly into the landspeeder.

"AFOSL","2009-06-22T17:48:31.89Z","One For The Completist's Display Cabinet.","It's hard to be retrospective with this kit without wanting to compare it to the speeder found in 4501 which was released five years later.
After opening the box you realize that this is very much a what you see is what you get model as the box art holds no secrets.  It is as basic as it looks with very few parts and no surprises in it's construction.
Assembly is quick and easy, broken down into 15 stages, and shouldn't take any builder more than ten or fifteen minutes to complete the model.
The colour scheme, whilst suiting the model perfectly, is far from movie accurate. The abundance of tan pieces clashes with the red highlights a little, whilst the grey adds a little detail to the front of the vehicle.  It does look like an odd combination of colours, but collectors should bear in mind that this model was among the first wave of Star Wars kits that Lego produced and was therefore limited by their range of bricks and colours at the time.
Two minifigures are included here.  This is one of four outings for Luke Skywalker in 1999, appearing in different guises in three other kits.  This is the first time he is seen in his Tatooine tunic though.  He also has a blue light saber with chrome hilt.  
This will be the first time old Ben is introduced as a Lego Minifigure.  A charming rendition, complete with grey beard to match his hair.  On a minor note, the figure lacks a cape and hood.  The inclusion of these items would have made the figure more movie accurate.  And on the subject of accuracies, two major characters are missing - C3P0 and R2D2.
At the time this kit was quite cheap and certainly the easiest way to acquire Tatooine Luke and Ben minifigures, but this really was, and still is a lack luster set.  It seems as if Lego put very little thought into it's production, quickly throwing something, anything together in order to get it on the market.  Maybe if it was released in the second wave of models it's misgivings might have been rectified and a better model released to the paying public.
Despite all this, it does have a certain charm and a new in box model fetches three times it's original value, with used, good condition kits fetching almost double.  One for the serious collector only.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"whaleyland","2012-10-24T13:38:57.72Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: The Future is Often Better","<p>
	It&#39;s already been noted how the LEGO <i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;line seemed to be a bit rushed when it first released. That cannot be more visible in the terribly feeble attempt at the iconic landspeeder from <i>A New Hope</i>.<br />
	<br />
	<b>Innovations: </b>Clearly, LEGO was trying to keep the price down for this little $5.99 set. It only included 49 pieces (though four of those were lightsaber parts). For that price, LEGO got the basic shape of the set right, and made it clear what the vehicle was. They even made new pieces for the exhaust vents, which was nice of them. But that is really it.<br />
	<br />
	<b>Lack of Inspiration: </b>There is nothing here to really shout out STAR WARS! It is just a vehicle with no wheels. The two figures barely fit in the cockpit and there is no room for R2-D2 or C-3PO anywhere, which I find a rather large oversight. The whole vehicle is too thick and not long enough. LEGO was trying too hard to keep the price down and sacrificed the greatness this set could have been. The 2010 Luke&#39;s Landspeeder set (8092) was so much better than this that it is hard to compare the two. Even the ComicCon exclusive set from 2012 had twice the piece count and looked better.<br />
	<br />
	<b>What It Got Right: </b>I suppose that the only thing really well done in this set is getting the basic shape down. There are no special features at all. That&#39;s it. The box looks good and helps highlight the scene, but LEGO in 1999 was relying too heavily on its boxes to sell its products.<br />
	<br />
	<b>Possible Improvements: </b>For starters, the set needs to be slightly thinner and slightly longer like the 2010 model. The engines are great and I actually like them better than the later attempts. But the red and beige don&#39;t match the punk and grey of the actual speeder. I feel LEGO chose beige to make it look more deserty, but that goes against the film. The same mistake was made with the other two renditions of this set. Adding in R2-D2 and C-3PO would have been nice, and making the entire set slightly wider would have helped with the overlapping arms problem that Luke and Obi-Wan are experiencing. Adding hidden wheels on the base would have also helped this set&#39;s ability to glide.<br />
	<br />
	<b>Minifigure: </b>The figures included in this set were pretty detailed for being produced in 1999. Luke, especially, is nice. He is wearing his white&nbsp;overcloak which continues onto his legs, always a nice touch. Trouser crease lines are also printed on the legs and a utility belt is printed over his cloak on his torso. His hair is a bit short for Luke, though they overdid it in 2010 (2012 was perfect), and his facial expression is the standard yellow-faced Luke, which I never liked much. Ben Kenobi is wearing his Jedi robes, which are tan with brown highlights. No leg printing, though the hip is a different color, and he has grey hair and a printed beard. Overall, he seems a bit angry but otherwise mostly appropriate. I wouldn&#39;t fault anyone for mistaking Obi-Wan for Owen Lars, though.<br />
	<br />
	<b>How it Compares: </b>As with many sets from 1999 and 2000, this set can be skipped in favor of the 2010 version. 2010 is just better in every way. Although that version is not perfect, this version has so many faults that it hardly looks like what it intends to be. It&nbsp;almost looks like a tan blob cruising along the desert rather than a landspeeder. I loved it when I first got it, but hindsight has made it a set I rarely even build much less display. Skip this one and go 2010 before it&#39;s too late.<br />

Since this standard and licensed MFs have only become more distant, the recent bridge in effort being Collectable Minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sand Blasted</b></div><div>The Landspeeder builds up from the ground very solidly and features some pleasant bits and pieces. The new sand colour was a dream come true for many, heralding a wave of natural and variant colour bricks in production. Sandy plates form the base and top of the build with a rounded corners to produce that classic landspeeder front, designed in line with the existing curved bricks, grey used here.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Red bricks are then used with grey to form the sides rear and front and a clever 'plug in' plate sits in a hole brick so the side engines form outwards and look snazzily correct. It was great that they used the old Space theme jet engine, very suitable. The rear is a little flat but not necessarily wrong. A simple and ever effective dark grill is placed on the engine top surface with a clear six stud wide windshield.</div><div><br></div><div>An interesting technique here is the placement of two passengers side by side in a six stud vehicle. Its surprising this has not been replicated more often with doors for City vehicles and so on. It uses two stud tiles with the offset one stud in the centre. Get four of these and those two seats hold Luke and Ben central and spaced with the angled side panels tucking under.</div><div><br></div><div>It was great that the old 'smoothy' haircut made it in to the Star Wars theme. While newer pieces have created increasingly realistic representation, the range fulfilled the Star Wars project so many of us had already started in previous eras. The removable lightsaber beam was inspired and sits in its delightful chrome lightsaber. At this stage it was nice to be able to use the yellow heads in other themes too.</div><div><br></div><div>Misgivings are perhaps the size of the landspeeder, the exclusion of C3PO and R2D2 riding sideways in a rear section and some colour switches. This set ideally could have been part of a sandcrawler release but it otherwise represents some great new colour bricks, a charming early Star Wars model, a late 20th Century icon, the first Lego film license, an early chrome MF clutch piece and&nbsp;a first trouser print? It was also completely refreshing after eyeing just how poor 1998 had been for Lego sets. During your Lego dark age you just look from afar yet I struggle to find many sets I want from that year.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>20th Century Box</b></div><div>The landspeeder is obviously popular and garners many five brick ratings. Most sets are never without a small flaw and compared to a more comprehensive release, four seems fairer for ingenuity and charm with regard to increased prices for licensed sets and an imperfect set.

<h4>Minifigs </h4>
<p>First we have Ben Kenobi. He is wearing a robe most Tatooine residents wear. He has tan pants with a brown belt. He has a straight expression on his face, a grey beard, and grey eyebrows. He has grey, standard Town hair. He has his blue lightsaber.</p>
<p>Then we have Luke Skywalker, before he became a jedi. He is wearing his white robe he did on Tatooine. He has a grey belt. His pants are tan, but the top half of them are white. He has his original head before they switched to the more serious one in Return of the Jedi, and blonde&nbsp;Town hair.</p>
<h4>Landspeeder</h4>
<p>Now the Landspeeder. Let me start off by saying that the engines are great! There are two on the side, and one on top. Behind the seats, there is a space where you can place Ben's lightsaber. I wish it could fit two though. The one problem is that the seats should have a stud of open space in front too, so the minifigures&nbsp;could fit better. </p>

It may not have the number of minifigures the newer set has, but that's alright.

"orybloodmyre","2010-09-01T15:32:11.867Z","My first star wars lego set ever!","<p>This was the 1st star wars set&nbsp;I ever got. It is by no means perfect, but to me, it will always be a favourite because &nbsp;as&nbsp;a 9 year old&nbsp;&nbsp;it costed me about 3 weeks pocket money to get and I had to tidy my room before I was allowed it. It was worth it, as my parents had got me the x-wing fighter set as well which was a very pleasant suprise. </p>
<p>At the time, all I seemed to do was play with lego, or the star was nes game where you have to do a lot of driving in the landspeeder, so I loved this set. I remember being pretty bummed that I didnt have any bad guys like tuskens or stormtroopers so had to make do with 'bounty hunters' made up from old sci fi&nbsp; and pirate minifgures from my lego box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As a 9 year old I also added those slidey things on the bottom which made it slide across the floor as it was pretty useless just sitting there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never owned the more recent land speeders, though do want the current one. For me, this will always be a favourite despite the lack of playability as It came with luke, who at the time was the coolest character as I was uneducated and didnt realize the awsomeness of the fett man. I liked having obi wan too, even though he always ended up dying as he didnt have a weapon because luke (in my oppinion) was more worthy of the only lightsaber that came with the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pros</p>
<p>Luke and ben, cheap, lightsaber and lots of happy memories!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cons</p>
<p>Its not the most accurate piece, but it was early on into the star wars range. Cut it some slack! Having R2D2 and C3PO would have been nice but the 3po miifigure hadn't been invented then I dont think. It would have been weird just to include r2d2 as in the movie its both doids who sit in here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overview: Dosent compare to the current set on the market, as you get far more for your money. But if your after it for a more nostaligic reason, I highly recomend it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-12T11:40:46.297Z","Follow Old Obi-Wan on some Darn Fool Idealistic Crusade","<p>Set #7110 Landspeeder: This is the first attempt at a LEGO Landspeeder and it does a passable job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being exposed to only this set I can not compare it to future Landspeeder endeavors on LEGO's behalf, so I will discuss the set normally. Basically this is a small end LEGO Star Wars set with two Mini-Figures and some great pieces to build up Luke's Landspeeder from Episode IV. The Landspeeder uses curved plates and bricks to give the impression of blocky roundedness (an oxymoron I suppose.) and it does resemble the Landspeeder. I'm just not sure if it is the right color scheme to be honest, personally though I think it serves adequately enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are the real draw I think, you get Luke and Old Ben Kenobi, a figure that is somewhat rare... I've only seen two or three sets offering old Obi-Wan from Episode IV. You also get Obi-Wan's lightsaber and I think this was the set that came with a spare Lightsaber hilt for Luke, but not the blade for whatever reason... Although I could be wrong on that front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this set is nice for your display/collection and offers up the chance to get a rare Old Ben Mini-Figure, if you can pick it up for a good price I don't think you'll be dissapointed. True Obi-Wan is the original yellow toned Mini-Figure, but that just adds to the rarity of the figure and the greatness of this set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"RJSS","2016-07-25T07:30:06.73Z","A classic. Enough said...","<p>This set was part of the very first wave of LEGO Star Wars sets, launched in 1999. We&#39;ll see how it holds up as a set...</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Parts on this set are quite uninteresting. We could highlight the windscreen, chairs, and turbines for being unusual, but nothing else. Some people will like the inclusion of 2x2 &#39;macaroni&#39; bricks and profile grill bricks, both in old light grey (a long retired color).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures is a great count for a $6 set!&nbsp;We get Luke Skywalker in his good ol&#39; moisture farmer robes (y&#39;know, before he learns about the force n&#39;stuff...). The amount of detailing on this figure is rather good, considering the time this was released. Sadly, the white details on his upper legs don&#39;t quite match the white tone of the torso (this is a common issue, where the color of printed parts doesn&#39;t match properly, in this case, due to one part being cast plastic, and the other part being&nbsp;<em>printed</em>&nbsp;white. Very prevalent in minifigures, sadly). However, things get better! The expression is quite versatile, and common. It is seen in all Lukes until 2006, I believe. It&#39;s a human face, so it can blend in&nbsp;your City diorama quite easily. His hairpiece is the classic Town male hairpiece in brick yellow, to simulate blond hair. This, however, blends with the color of his leg bindings somewhat suspiciously...</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, on to old Ben Kenobi. Personally, I think Luke&#39;s minifig is vastly superior to this one. Printed details are not spot on, since the legs and arms are unprinted, brick yellow elements. The hips piece is brown... probably to simulate a belt, but still not very spot on. It&#39;s a nice breath of fresh air from the amount of brick yellow in this guy, though. The torso doesn&#39;t offer much, only very simple, and even&nbsp;<em>cartoony</em>&nbsp;looking detailing. There&#39;s some brown on his chest for his &#39;undershirt&#39; maybe, but the color is slightly botched for the same reason&nbsp;Luke&#39;s legs are. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a fine detail. The headpiece has some nice printing, showing a stern-faced old man (that&#39;s how Ben looks like in ANH, anyways!). Interestingly enough, the face on this guy would be reused as Luke Skywalker&#39;s face in 2006-2009 releases (conspiracy anyone?), minus the beard and in flesh color, obviously. His accesory is a chrome-hilt lightsaber (shame those died out in the mid 2000s).</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;ll probably look like I&#39;m asking for too much now, but something like a Tusken Raider, or even the droids would have made the minifigure selection mucb richer, and increased play value.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build won&#39;t feature much of interest, since it&#39;s a small, $6 set. Very quick and simple, and once you get the hang of it, you won&#39;t even need the instructions to rebuild it anymore in case you want to&nbsp;scrap it for parts. The seats, though, attach in a very clever way, using jumper plates to space them by one stud while keeping them centered inside the model. Nice! The side engines attach through Technic-System bricks and plates, whereas the middle one uses conventional SOT. However, it is placed&nbsp;one stud farther back than the ones on the sides to further achieve accuracy. It&#39;s the&nbsp;attention to such small details that makes sets like these so great!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></p>

<p>As blocky and simplistic looking as it is, it&#39;s a fair looking representation of the X34 vehicle. The sides are rather&nbsp;flat, since the flex-tube&nbsp;technique&nbsp;needed to give it a more 3D appearance was&nbsp;not yet available, sadly. The windscreen is also rather inaccurate, but it can be replaced with part 62360&nbsp;(which is the exact same size) to improve its accuracy and looks. The interior features nothing other than the seats, which is a shame because there is just about enough space to sneak in some printed tiles or studs just below the windscreen piece. The model itslef is quite hollow, with two gaps inside the nose and one big 2x4 space at the back. Since these spaces are covered by plates that can be lifted off, they could be considered storage compartments for Ben&#39;s lightsaber and whatever other accesories you&#39;d like to sneak in.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Right off the vat, let me say I&#39;m a big fan of this set. It&#39;s been in my collection for quite some time, and I have a soft spot for the older, blockier designs that LEGO Star Wars used to offer.While the parts are a rather mediocre selection, the finished model suits the $6 price tag just fine. There&#39;s no real play features here sadly. No Tuskens for Ben to scare off, nor any R2D2 minifigures to drop off the fuselage&nbsp;of&nbsp;a moving&nbsp;Landspeeder. Nostalgia aside, this set gets a 3.5/5 for me. It has some nice added value to it because of it being part of the&nbsp;<em>first&nbsp;</em>LEGO Star Wars wave of sets, and it&#39;ll definitely display rather&nbsp;nicely with other sets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written about this set before, but failed to link an image to the post, so I republished it.</p>

<p>I bought this set because it is <strong>cheap and easy to customize.</strong></p>

<p>Because:&nbsp;This set was not overly complicated by the designers.&nbsp;Unfortunately in the wrong sense.</p>

<h3>Landspeeder</h3>

<p>What strikes me first is that there is <strong>no steering wheel!</strong>&nbsp;If the 2x8 brick in the middle of its length had been replaced with a 2x6 brick, there would be enough space for the steering wheel.</p>

<p>The minifigures are sitting too high. Instead of a seat part, it would have been better to just make a backrest from <a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/2432/tile-special-1-x-2-with-handle/"" target=""_blank"">1x2 black bar handle parts</a>. And replacing the jumper plate with a black one.</p>

<p>Too bad the windshield is squarish. At that time, so many unnecessary large special elements were produced that could not be used later, it would have been better to design a <a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/62360/windscreen-3-x-6-x-1-curved-with-2-circular-stud-holders-in-bottom/47/"" target=""_blank"">6-brick wide curved windshield.</a> What they still use today.&nbsp;This sloping windshield is specifically for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/918-1/One-Man-Space-Ship"" target=""_blank"">first classic space theme</a>, just not yellow but transparent. There&rsquo;s a bit of a nostalgia factor in it, as this set is from the first Star Wars theme.</p>

<p>The<strong> vehicle was originally hovered</strong>, but here the designers did nothing under the vehicle. At least a <strong>2x4 transparent brick</strong>.&nbsp;Or if the kid wanted to slide the toy on the carpet, the designers could have placed three <a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/2654/plate-round-2-x-2-with-rounded-bottom-boat-stud/7/"" target=""_blank"">2x2 Gray round plates with Rounded Bottom</a> under the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>I like all 2 minifigures, especially Luke&rsquo;s painting.&nbsp;The chrome lightsaber is also beautiful, the only problem is that the paint wears off easily.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p><strong>There are good things too.</strong> The minifigures are beautiful compared to their age, I like that their faces are still yellow. And the boxart is beautiful too. Even with this small set, there is an alternative builds.&nbsp;And most importantly, it&rsquo;s a cheap, entry-level set. Easy to customize.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>It was already a huge change in the look that I put a curved windshield on the vehicle.</p>

<p>To fit the steering wheel, I replaced the 2 x 8 dark gray bricks with a 2x6 tan colored brick.</p>

<p>I put a basic detail, gratings and sloping bricks on the back of the vehicle because there wasn&rsquo;t nothing, just a 1x8 brick there either.</p>

<p>And I put three 2x2 gray rounded plates on the bottom of the vehicle to make it look like it was floating.</p>
