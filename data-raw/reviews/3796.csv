"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T18:21:47Z","Not bad for $1.70","I have noticed that this model gets a lot of flack.  I like it so here is my take.

This set has a good supply of pieces and until the Sand blue one comes out it is the only set with the Brown wing corners.  

The printed droid face is unique and the transforming ability is decent(not great).

I do agree with most people that the brown is hard to use but be creative it's LEGO.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T01:53:33Z","Cool","This is a all-right set but it has its limits when you fold it. I think its good the way lego made it so you can make it stand as well as fly, but the stand makes it a bit wonky and easy to fall over. Also in stand mode droid fighters cross their legs over.
This set is better with the naboo starfighter and I don't have that so I only use this from time to time. 
It is great for the brown pieces and the wings are nicly made.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T13:18:17Z","Better than the Vulture Droid","I Got this set a long time ago, and thought it was a great representation of the Droid Starfighter. I love the Brown wings, and really like the printed pieces on the wings and on the head. It is a great addition to my droid army. However, I'm confused as to what the read lights on the back are supposed to be (not visible in the pic), maybe guns? -1   I don't understand why lego has you remove the head and stick it on top, that is just a lock of creativity (lego did the same on the Vulture Droid). I don't have any better way to build it though, so I won't deduct points for this. I just recently got Anakin's Jedi Starfighter and Vulture Droid though, and I was disappointed that there were so many stickers. The reason why I mention the Vulture Droid is that it has been given credit in its reviews to be better than the Droid Starfighter. The printed pieces on the Droid Starfighter as opposed to those annoying stickers give the Droid major ups. Also, the Vulture Droid was said to be more sturdy. NOT TRUE! The Starfighter has a lot of bulk in its work, and other than the wings (which are meant to be moved to transform the droid) the Droid is just as sturdy as its more up-to-date counterpart, if not, more sturdy. Not to dis the Vulture However, as I would recommend you to get the set. Overall, the printed pieces and sweet wings make the Droid Starfighter a great set!

I totally recommend one, something I never thought of myself to do, since I never expected it to be this nice, until I got him on clearance (bought both this one and Desert Skiff for only 11,40 euros, or 13.82 dollars) the only thing that bothers me is the lack of any minifig. I know the real thing is a droid itself and doesn't need a pilot, but the Tie-Fighter got a Stormie as well, they could have given us a Battle-Droid to make it even better. But it's still good as it is, though it's not very usable for custom creations. Not that I mind, since I keep my sets intact. good job TLC",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2007-10-20T03:33:31.433Z","Transformers, Starwars In Disguise","As usual I haven't seen star wars so I had very little idea what this was until reading the other reviews so let me give you a non fans perspective.

At first glance all you see is a small brown spaceship. You ask yourself where is the pilot? Well if you look closer you realize this space ship is actually a robot that can transform into a droid type of form. Kind of like a transformer. So it doesn't need a mini-fig. Also I realized in playing with it how much fun they are when they blow up and they are quite simple to reconstruct. To transform is quite simple as well without trying it can be done in under 20 seconds.

I found it to be fragile but once you know what you are doing it is not a problem. This adds to the destruction and reconstruction of this model.

Overall it's a good model and I cant find problem. I think there is one similar with stickers, well this one has none so another plus from me. I feel a 6/10 is appropriate hear mainly due to the transforming part. This is another one of those models where it's really a personal choice. I say if it's cheap get it if not don't worry.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-13T16:09:20.077Z","My first set.","This set could be a lot better.But as it happens this starfighter rests in my Lego grave [R.I.P].

This set is a bit chunky and it lacks visible weapons, furthermore it is hard to transform it to walker mode.On the other hand this set is extremly sturdy and well designed.It is also very movie acurate and despite being replaced with the vulture droidfighter both in the films and in the stores this will remain the set that started it all for me.

Buy if you want a great army builder or set.
Don't buy if you'd rather have the more advanced vulture droid.

I then proceeded to order one along with my Republic Gunship for less then I paid for MSRP. I've got to say, you can build up quite a navy with these ships. The current Bricklink price is $3. For that, you get a ship with, though no standing droids, a pretty sufficient amount of playability. I have both the three copies of this set and one of the vulture droids, and I've got to say that even though the vulture droid is better in appearance, these ships are much better in value. Think about this... the price of one of these ships is less than one of the new battle droids. You can build a large navy with these, which is what I would recommend them for.

If you're going to play with it a lot, however, keep in mind it is an older set with not as much playability as the newer Vulture Droids.<br>BUILDING EXPERIENCE<br>It's an older set, so the building is simplistic. There's not a lot of SNOT techniques used because, once again, it is an older set. Also, there are no minifigs or droids what so ever.<br>PARTS AND GIMMICKS<br>The parts aren't that great actually. I would have only rated it a three, but this set does come with brown bricks, which I don't see very often. Also there are no stickers. All bricks which have designs are printed, most notably the head. So I rated it a four out of five. As for gimmicks, like all Vulture Droids, you can have it in a flying mode seen in the picture. You can also angle the wings down as legs, and take the head off and move it to the front of the body. Yes you have to take the head off which is connected by a Technic pin. There are no hinges on the head. Sure, it isn't as good as the newer Vultures, but at least it has the walking mode.<br>PLAYABILITY<br>With the gimmicks, playability improves. Without them, you basically would have a brick. No moving pieces. The lack of great pose-ability marks it down a bit, but it is fun to ""fly"" around and attack Jedi, clones, whatever.<br>OVERALL<br>For the price of six bucks? Yes that's great. If you really want this, maybe go up to eight but no higher.I do recommend it, but maybe get something else before it. The lack of pose-ability marks it down some, but it does look cool and it is the only brown Vulture there is. So if you really want it, get it, but you can pass it up and you won't feel bad.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

<h4>Minifigures</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The set's major lacking is that there's no minifigures. Had the Naboo Starfighter been implemented in the same set with this ship, like the 2007 version (and the minifigs included), things would have been okay. But with this as a stand-alone Lego could have simply put a battle droid or two in this set, which would have made things better.</div>
<h4>The Build</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>There is not much difficulty in building this set, and its only tough part for a young builder is something with how the hinged pieces get put on, otherwise I have had no trouble at all building the set recently. If you have all the parts together, it takes about 10 minutes to complete.</div>
<h4>The Completed Model</h4><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The finished product is just okay, by today's standards. Don't get me wrong, it looks nice, but overall the newer versions have all been much better. The four wings can be placed in two positions on the side plates, for cruising or battle, and they both rotate so you can stand the Droid Starfighter on its (now) legs. The head also pops off to reposition for walking mode. If you have figs to spare, this can be used for a hangar scene or Droid forces or whatever you want. If you happen to own other 'Space' Episode I sets, such as the Naboo Starfighter, then there you go. That's about as playable as the set gets.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This is a good small set; for $5.99 it has pretty good value. The fact that it has no figs is the main problem, but if you have other sets, there isn't really a problem.

Since then, many different forms of this set have released, though not all have been improvements.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); min-height: 14px; ""><b></b><br></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>With the original Droid Starfighter, LEGO was stuck with the problem of making the vehicle ""walk"" like in&nbsp;<i>The Phantom Menace</i>. It decided to use some mechanics, and some rebuilding to achieve this. The rebuilding aspect—basically taking off the long wings and spacing them apart—was actually a rather new concept for LEGO and it hasn't been heavily replicated since. The mechanical element, a simple hinge beneath the head to allow it to pivot, was well done even if it was simple. The new wing pieces, however, were nice and important and have been used in all droid starfighter designs since (except the micro builds).</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); min-height: 14px; ""><b></b><br></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Lack of Inspiration:&nbsp;</b>Rounding was simply not something LEGO was good at in 1999, and it clearly shows in this set. While the ""real"" droid starfighter—later dubbed the Vulture Droid—was all around rounded with a thin&nbsp;fuselage for the droid brain, the LEGO set comes off extremely bulky in the middle, with wings that seem disproportionately centered. The glowing red eyes are entirely lacking on the printed brain piece, which was a major oversight corrected in later sets. Overall, while you get the feel of the Vulture Droid, the set misses the aesthetics of it.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); min-height: 14px; ""><b></b><br></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>What It Got Right:&nbsp;</b>Yet the intent is obvious, and the set is mostly to scale to minifig-scale sets, including the Naboo Starfighter. The separating wings and ability to walk, even if crude, are noted inclusions that should not be overlooked. The fighter itself is more nimble and lithe than the LEGO set, but that is to be expected. And for all the lack of curves, LEGO has not done a great job since to clean up those curves.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); min-height: 14px; ""><br></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); ""><b>Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b>For all the possible improvements that can be suggested, most have been tried and failed. Making the vehicle more articulate sacrifices its structural integrity as in the case of set 7660 Naboo N-1 Starfighter and Vulture Droid. That set proved to have just as bulky of a fighter craft but the wings fell off incredibly easily. The 2005 7256 Jedi Starfighter and Vulture Droid set copied this design very closely, though it added weapons to the wings. The head was attached in a different manner to allow better mobility, but instead, it simply fell off easier. Perhaps only the mini Vulture Droid (30055) proved to fix all the problems associated with lose constructs, but in this case, the wings couldn't reconnect. Thus, LEGO never did much to improve this design except replace a solid build, in this case, with flimsier pieces to improve articulation.</p>

For an&nbsp;<i>Episode I&nbsp;</i>model created in 1999, the design of this set has changed little in its later iterations, suggesting that it was an extremely good design. While aesthetically it could certainly use improvement, LEGO seems to have been unable to find a decent means of doing that improvement without sacrificing structural integrity. Thus, this set I can only recommend as an appropriate addition to any&nbsp;<i>Battle of Naboo-</i>&nbsp;or<i>Clone Wars</i>-themed display</p>

"StraightMaton","2012-10-30T20:49:52.72Z","Neat build on the go","I remember getting this set at a gas station half way through a long trip in the middle of nowhere, Southern Arizona. My parents bought it for me to keep me busy for the rest of the trip and it definitely worked. It was a fun and cheap build. The final product is a neat little ship that you can ''fly'' around the room. The model itself lacks any real detail or features but this is understandable for such a cheap set. In all honesty I don't remember playing with it much and it ended up totally destroyed soon after I got it. Still, it left some interesting and unique pieces I suppose.<div><br></div><div>All in all it's a neat little set that kept me occupied.

"vikings","2020-05-26T07:02:03.317Z","Nice Droid Fighter","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. Comes with a little longer than normal small/medium instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a couple cool parts in this set. You get four 2x16x1 brown roof tiles used on the wings which are really cool. You also get six printed pieces which are: four 1x4 dark grey tiles with wire and tech printing on it, a 1x2 light grey tile with tech printing on it, and a 2x4x1 armor part with the droid fighters eyes on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great set. Even today it still looks good. Each wing can be moved&nbsp;into a landing/walking form. It is very sturdy in its walking form and looks really good. I have seen a lot of complaints about this set not coming with a minifigure, but I don&#39;t have a problem with it at all. I would have liked some sort of cannons or blasters of some sort, but it is an older set, so I can let it slide. I highly recommend this set to add to your Lego Star Wars collection. This set has held up nicely over the years and looks great. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this is extremely cheap and affordable set, it remains one of the best star wars sets from &#39;99. It is a simple build which can be assembled in a matter of minutes with only 62 pieces and 0 figures.</p>

<p>In terms of playability, it has a very light, swoosh-able build and can easily change between flight and walking modes. This is done by simply clicking the hinges down and moving the legs. There is very little in the way of detail and the design begins to look dated almost 19 years later, however this is excusable , given the vast changes within the lego group over the last 20 years.</p>

<p>Luckily it is very easy to still get hold of one of these sometimes under &pound;10 with a box and under &pound;5 without.</p>

This set does a really good job at depicting the fighter. the only problem I found was that the wings were bulky and would stand up in land mode.Overall, I think it is a good set, and suggest picking it up if you&#39;re a fan of the prequels.</p>
