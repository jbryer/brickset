"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-26T08:07:01Z","Right combination of ingredients","Like any recipe from a cookbook, a set needs the right ingredients to make it work. Here, all the right ingredients are there. And what's more, together they make a nice combination.

There's the good guy and a swoop to get him where he needs to be, there's two bad guys and a moisture evaporator to fight about. My interest in the Star War sets lies in photographing short stories like these, and Tusken Raider encounter is easily the most versatile one I own in this respect.

One oddness though, has anyone else noticed that bricks that are in non-standard colors seem to be made of softer material? Especially dark red and dark grey seem to be affected, and get easily scratched or dented when disassembling a model.

That's the only gripe I may have, but it's a minor one and not a fault of the set itself.

"ShatteredGnome","2010-06-14T14:23:39.263Z","Some Great Parts and a Fun Swoop","<p>I got this in 2002 when it came out, and I have memories of building and playing with this set&nbsp;along with the Jedi Duel set.&nbsp;There are some excellent and rare parts, including the dark red pieces of the swoop bike, and with 3 minifigures, it's a steal at $10.</p>
<h4>The Build and Playability:</h4>
<p>Building this set is fun, though not very challenging. The moisture farming spire is not difficult and more of scenery, but you can still use it as it has an opening top hatch that reveals a computer panel. The swoop bike is the main feature of the set, and the most fun to build. There are some interesting parts used, and once completed, it looks very nice, for an earlier&nbsp;Star Wars speeder. This is the only set so far that includes an actual ""swoop"" bike, and not a speeder bike (the swoop is the civilian version). The set has good playability, especially because of the swoop, and pretty good value for parts.&nbsp;Playability is enhanced by the minifigures: Anakin Skywalker(Ep.II) and two tusken raiders. Unseen (to my knowledge) in&nbsp;the Lego Star Wars video games, this set is made from Anakin's attack on the tusken raiders' camp, and you can have a sort of ""battle"" with Anakin attacking them, or use other sets to create a rescue mission, should you so choose. Other than that, playability is otherwise limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Minifigures:</h4>
<p>The minifigures included in the set are Anakin Skywalker (Episode II) and 2 Tusken Raiders. The nice thing is, this is the cheapest method of acquiring Anakin and the only set with Tusken Raiders. Anakin has a unique&nbsp;torso and face&nbsp;and includes brown cape and a blue lightsaber, and the tusken raiders are completely unique to this set, each with a black 'pirate' rifle. If you want to reenact scenes from A New Hope, or Tatooine in general this is a good set because of the tusken raiders as well.</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<p>-Cheapest set for&nbsp;Ep.II Anakin</p>
<p>-Very unique swoop bike</p>
<p>-Good value and rare/unique parts</p>
<p>-Only set with tusken raiders</p>

<p>It includes an updated Moisture Vaporator compared to the one built in the previous film's Lightsaber Duel set. This one actually has a new plate printed with a little water gathering tool and some water collected from the desert air... Or however Vaporators work. You also build up Clieg Lars' swoop, which Anakin borrowed to track down the Tusken Raiders.</p>

<p>This set is a must have, if only because Tusken Raiders are needed for any good Tatooine display, I think LEGO should revist a Tusken set theme, but with The Clone Wars taking over most of the LEGO Star Wars sets lately it is harder and harder to come by some good sets based on the films without the animation style of the Clone Wars mucking things up.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: This set is a partial recreation of Ep II when Anakin goes after his mother and meets up with the Tusken Raiders. The purpose of the set is obviously geared toward the rare minifigures and not the models, and it does a nice job as such.<br></li><li>Pro 2: You get a moisture vaporator, which is cool for your Tatooine scenes; and you get Anakin's speeder, which is nicely put together. I dig the sand colored pieces and the dark red pieces on the speeder.<br></li><li>Pro 3: Best of all from this set are the Tusken Raiders. As others have mentioned in their reviews these two figures are rare and don't show up often. I mainly got this set for them, and it was a worthwhile investment. The Ep II Anakin is also a good addition to your collection.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Being that this set is at the low-end price wise one should expect too much, but it would have been cool to have a Tusken tent, or a female Tusken raider as well. But those are minor points.<br></li></ul>
<p>I can't say too many negative things about this set because it is pretty basic, and was meant to be. Its a cool set for your Tatooine scenes and you get some really unique minifigures. If you can find one for a decent price I'd suggest picking it up.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
