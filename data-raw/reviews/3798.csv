They shouldn't have put jar jar in, even though he did become the general, I think they should have put in that Ct. guy who tried to save binks and binks got both of them caught.  They also should have had more for $9.99, they should have put in some droids or maybe some more gungans on foot. The rest I like though. The sheilds, and the animal... horse... things are cool.  The warrior is pretty much matched exactly like the ones in the movie.  Over all its a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-30T08:17:36Z","Good set","I like this set the figs of the Gungans and Kaadu's are very nice and not only for the space freak. I know some star wars fans hate Jar Jar Binks but the civilisation of the Gungans is very nice (and it has a bit of Jugendstil-style). It was only better if they had also 2 infantery troops in it. I've got 2 of this sets and both for half prize.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There are alotta gungans (Which I am not a huge fan of) and the kaadu they are mounted on. They apparently haul carts filled wityh explosive energy balls or &quot;boomers&quot;. I like the details on the gungan warriors! The kaadu are strange but they work. I would normally make the droids overcome them and strip the gungans but you know, they are the good guys!

"Gus_263","2008-04-04T14:25:12.187Z","Gungan Patrol","One of the small released in 1999, this set of the Star Wars episode 1 features the gungans. The set is basic but have a good color scheme, design, useful pieces and a basic building. The minifigures included are two gungans and two kaadus. The gungans are good detailed and the color scheme is good, altough the heads aren't coloured. The gungans also have two black spears and some blue pieces used as bombs. The kaadus are also good detailed but have only their color and aren't playable. Altough these are not playable, they stay in feet. Connected by cords to the cart, the kaadus can carry one minifigure like a horse carry one. The cart is solid and have a nice color scheme woth some blocks making it not much detailed. The solid building still cool because it looks like more the cart of the movie and carry the blue bombs. The wheels are big and it rolls very well. Overall, a nice small set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I can understand why you would not want 10 Jar Jar minifigures, but common, he is an awesome guy! This also includes two kaadus, and an opening container for all the blue ""bombs"".

This is because it didn't have any droids (which didn't actually bother me when i got it but i was about 6)also there's something about the bomb thing that is lees than satisfactory. Gunguns are good and the, uh. um. Horsey thingies?

"CFL_fan777","2009-03-07T15:39:03.577Z","A Interesting Set","This is a good lego set. It includes two kaadus, a jar jar binks and a gungan soldier for figures. The build is fun and it is interesting seeing how it is made. The storage compartment in the back of one kaadu opens up to reveal 7 energy balls. The energy balls slide out easy do to a ramp (wedge) lego piece inside. On jar jar bink's kaddu there are two tan poles that fit on the back of it making the kaadu look much better. They can fall off easy though. On the back of the kaadu there is also a printed lego piece that looks like a pouch (a nice assessory). There are two small green baseplates that also help keep the kaadus balanced so they can be put on display or be played with easily.

Overall, this is a good lego set but not a great one. It has good play value and looks pretty good on display. The price is a bit high for the number of pieces but it is reasonable still.

"Kalhiki","2010-08-01T12:15:06.81Z","A simple little set","<p>This is a nice set. Like most older Star Wars sets, it was simple, and more of part of the background in the movies.</p>
<p><b>BUILDING EXPERIENCE - </b>Really, the only thing you build is the wagon. Other than that, you have two, solid piece duck things that the Gungans ride (Honestly, I don't know what they are) and the minifigs. So, the building experience is so-so.</p>
<p><b>PARTS - </b>I really like the bombs. they are clear blue and look really good. I just wish they were minifig heads to make them rounder like they were in the movie. But you also get two Gungans, which are pretty hard to find in sets. And you get the duck things, which were only in this set I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p><b>PLAYABILITY - </b>Playability isn't that great. Without an enemy, what will you do with it? I guess it is good for display, though. By itself, the wagon can roll around and also open to store the bombs. But I do advise to get a droid set like the AAT or MTT. Maybe a battle pack even just to have someone to fight. However, what I have found out is that this is a great set for army building. Just think, get a few of these sets, and you have your own little squadron of Gungans!</p>
<p><b>OVERALL AND VALUE - </b>I recommend getting this or around maybe 6-7 dollars if you want it. Maybe go up to the actual price of 10 if you really want it. But only get this set if you have some droids to fight.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
"Shez","2010-06-13T16:24:33.577Z","Ready to Battle the Trade Federation?","<p>Even though many people argee that Episode 1 was a disappointment, I think the episode redeemed itself by bringing great possibilities for Lego with interesting characters, vechiles and scenery. Most of which were very colorful. Gungan Patrol is the stereotypical episode 1 set in this sense.</p>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>I've built quite a few lego sets in my lifetime and I have to saw this is one of the most enjoyable builds I have ever done. It&nbsp;only has&nbsp;77 pieces but with the new pieces and prints it is a great set&nbsp;to put together. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The best and most obvious parts in this set are the two kaadus included. Their orange color really stands out in a mass of Lego and they are only included in this set so far. There are other parts that catch the eye such as the tan tubes on the back of Jar Jar Binks' kaadu and a printed sack is also on Jar Jar Bink's kaadu that is quite interesting. This set also has a dark purple Gungan shield and two black spears for the figures. There are 7 transparent energy balls included that fit nicely into the carrier behind the Gungan Warrior's kaadu.</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>The kaadus are very steady and they also include a green&nbsp;4x4 flat plate for both of them to stand on for play. The back of the Gungan Warrior's carrier opens up to drop the energy balls. This is done by putting them on a brown ramp and closing the back of the carrier with a flap. The wheels on the carrier also move and the whole set is very durable. </p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>The set definitely represents what was shown in Epsiode 1 but it isnt perfect. Detail on the faces of the Gungangs is lacking and the shield was about twice as big being able to cover a Gungan's whole body. The kaadu was well exectued and looks very good. It has more of a hunched back in the movie but this one looks more then fine. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>In the year 2000 when this set first came out, Jar Jar Binks was in so many sets it was almost impossible not to have multiples of him. Now, Jar Jar Binks hasn't been in a Lego set for a few years and he&nbsp;is getting harder to find (some say this is a good thing). The Gungan warrior is my favorite out of the two figures because of the torso design. It is really unique and makes the figure look overall better. I would of have preferred two Gungan Warriors but I'm still quite happy with this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was really happy with this set and I'd reccomend any Star Wars Lego fan to purchase it. Like most Lego sets, it is a great play toy and collector's item. If you have any addition questions feel free to contact me. Thanks for reading. :)</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Gungans are too underused in sets. They are in 2 sets I believe. Not enough for a true battle!</li></ul>
<p>Overall I like this set. Quite a nice finished result with nice minifigs!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
