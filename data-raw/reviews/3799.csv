"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T16:54:38Z","Nice to have, but not a great model","Picked this one up relatively cheaply on eBay - I'm glad I've got it, but it's far from a must have.  Could be cool with another one of these combined with the Falcon, however.

The construction's just a little too blocky (I know, it's Lego) for this sleak - looking vehicle and the scale just doesn't seem right.  Also, the cockpit that isn't fully enclosed feels a bit rushed.

Also, why do we get Lobot, rather than a cloud car pilot - that was a bit confusing.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-24T15:51:29Z","Cool set","This is one of my favorite star wars sets.Even though he doesn't ride in it, it would be cool to include Lando.  
Pros:
Sleek design
Lobot minifig
cool color scheme

Cons:
Should have come with another minifig.
 Overall,great set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-12T13:45:45Z","Almost a Taxi!","This set must be cool, you can open the engine compartment, the sides of the pods, and the windows of the pods! Also, you get two Walkie Talkies, one for the driver, and the one for the passenger, so you can tell the driver where you're going! Don't forget, The model seems the same shape! (If you could take off the studs)  It also takes the same role of a taxi!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-08T23:23:56Z","Awesome set!","One of the best Star Wars sets! The design is still sleek and very accurate! The compartments are very neat and I love the design of the pod doors so it's easier to sit the minifig inside. The cockpit is pretty good and I like the windows. Color scheme is very accurate, too.

Maybe it would've been nice to have the acutal cloud car pilot as a minifig, but the Lobot minifig rocks!!!!!! There are some complaints that the model is not that sleek as it should be. It's Lego, so expect the 'edges' to be a little 'rough'. Good price, great design!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T18:05:49Z","Decent sw set","I got my cloudcar for clearance at about six bucks, but otherwise the retail doesn't ask for much more--starwars.com value is $10. In my opinion it's a good deal either way. We get a nice, detailed minifig-scale ship that's appropriately sleek. The cloudcars are a welcome addition to the sw line-up, and just the right size for a minifig-scale economy set. 

Any cons? 

The canopies aren't done airtight; they use pieces from the old space sets that leave the sides open. 
(I don't mind this one, though; it's actually hard to really see, and anything fancier would have driven the price up.)

And Lobot: the figure's great, but representative of Lego's pattern of minifigging characters and keeping as far away from 'extras' as possible, with of course the exception of those stormtroopers and the background jedi of the gunship set. I wouldn't have minded having a Bespin guard pilot, but Lobot's works.

good thing:
-the door was easy to open
-the minifig fits perfectly
-the engine thing can open
-cool Lobot

bad thing:
-it will be good to add Lando

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-01T20:34:42Z","Fairly Nice!","I love this set! I can't stop playing with it! It was the first Star Wars set I received, and it is awesome! The only thing I would change is the engine. Why does it open up? you don't even have anything to store in it. Other then that, this is an awesome set and I would reccomend this to anybody who likes smooth models!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T12:11:23Z","just a few flaws...","plus:

-great design and colour scheme

-engine, cockpit and sidedoors open

-fits minifigs easily

-comes with Lobot, who is a great minifig, and a nice addition to the Cloud City set

minus:

-some gaps between the canopy and the rest of the cockpit. too bad, but not too noticable, thank goodness

-while being a great fig, Lobot doesn't have much to do with Cloud Cars, sure, he works and lives in the city that is guarded by these Twin Pods, but doesn't drive them. the inclusion of two generic Cloud Car Pilots would have been much better. but even if you can get over the fact that Lobot isn't supposed to ride this thing, it's still kind of an oxymoron to get one fig with a twin-vehicle, why didn't they include another fig, like a Bespin Security Guard or even Lando, to further enhance this li'l inaccuracy?

due to this strange issue of one guy included with a double craft, and the fact that the guy's not even supposed to sit in it, I'm forced to take one point off.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-01T15:29:08Z","The Rare and Fine!","       These are fascinating and mysterious ships from the movie, in which you never see them often and you never get a close look at one! The Cloud City Air Guard has these things running around patrolling the Bespin airspace. The lego one is good! The pods can seat two passengers, one the pilot, one the gunner/navigator/passanger. The red color is a nice touch along with adding the cyborg Lobot. It is a good minifig but I just somehow dont like figs with blank heads with the holes in them. The pods are connected like the TIE Fighter pylons and are a bit shakey. They wont usually fall off in flight unless you shake it or crash it somehow. It uses some fine pieces to make it more aerodynamic and the engine slate is neato! For only 10 dollars, this set is very quality! I am not much for the Cloud Car but I must say that the lego model really follows through on a movie-realistic version! A nice purchase for the builder!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T16:15:11Z","Lack of Minifig clouds my judgement ","I bought several of these just for parts when they first came out . When I saw one the other day in a clearance sale for 5 GBP I thought I would actually make it up and add it to my SW collection. I feel it is a great little set fairly accurate - so far as I can tell, with nice opening cockpits and central pod. Like everyone else I wonder why there is not another Minifig?  For value and looks I think it rates a 9, but it could have been a little better â€“ maybe there will be an updated re-release one day like several of the other SW sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

However, I do agree with everyone here that a cloud city security guard is seriously needed! Good value, even with Ebay's slight inflated prices nowadays!

The door is cool to let the pilot in and so forth. I dont like the lobot figure, I mean, i like him, but in this set, a cloud car pilot would be much better.  The central part is quite shaky just like the TIEs and sith Infilitrator but they wont come of unless youy pull. Finally, an all red star wars craft.

"Yoda____","2008-10-28T15:38:47.717Z","Chunky ","Yes this set isn't entirely accurate but anyone who has cloud city pretty much needs this set. What I do is take the to cabins apart and just play with them.
I'd give the set 3 out of 5 as a star wars set but a 5 out of 5 as a lego set. Plus, Lobot does look pretty cool. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TinyHippo","2009-07-31T08:51:05.013Z","No sets like this one anymore!","This set was great value, when new. Especially considering it contained a unique, OT minifig. I'm personally a big fan of the colour scheme lego used, even if it should've been orange, perhaps. A second pilot would've been nice, but we can't have everything, can we?

The build is, as some reviewers already mentioned, really solid. Droppable, if you had a clumsy moment. On top of that it is very swooshable, the rounded prows adding to the effect.

The doors are a cute touch, as is the opening engine block.

For the price paid, you wouldn't get anywhere near as many bricks today. So it had value on it's side, too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-11-11T12:54:55.42Z","Strange...","  I am not a big fan of Star Wars and so never understood this set. I received it as a birthday present many years ago.
  I used to enjoy flying this around and fighting some of my younger bro's sets. I like the two pods so you can have a passenger, but I don't understand why a robot would be piloting a spaceship. And more importantly, how come his wires are clearly visible on the back of his head. That makes him WAY too vulnerable.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AFOSL","2009-06-23T10:46:42.293Z","Hit And Miss","Like a lot of things in the Star Wars universe, the Twin Pod Cloud car is of a peculiar design that doesn't quite lend itself well to Lego.  This certainly shows in this model which represents a good overall effort, but makes you think that it could have probably been done better.  A slight increase in size would help and possibly expand the range of pieces from which to use in it's construction.<br>Luckily enough, this set was released during the 2002 line up, a time that Lego had started to introduce new elements.  Some of these are included in this kit and help it come close to the look of it's movie counterpart.  It is certainly recognizable. <br><br>Construction is quick and shouldn't pose any problems.  The instructions are laid out in Lego's usual manner - that is, they are of the high standard I have come to expect from Lego - clear and precise.<br>Both pods are built at the same time, being mirror opposites connected by a central beam and power plant.  Both pods have access hatches to the side and their tops are also hinged.  The central engine unit is also hinged, so can be opened, but there is no detail inside.  Very strange.<br>Although the front section of the pods are sleek and smooth, the rear section and cockpits soon turn into a pile of standard Lego bricks and have a very boxy look to them.  It's a shame the sleekness isn't carried back from the nose into this area of the craft.  Improvements could certainly be made should this ship ever get a re-release.<br><br>The Minifigure is new and exclusive to the cloud car.  Here we have Lobot, the cyborg aide to Lando Calrissian from the movie, The Empire Strikes Back.<br>To be strict, Lobot was never seen flying a cloud car in the movie, but it is still nice that he is included here and recognized by Lego.  The minifigure also carries a CB radio, something the movie counterpart never had or needed, due to his cyborg implants.  The other inaccuracy is that the Lobot minifigure carries the faintest hint of a smile, something Lobot never did.<br>A true cloud car pilot or two would have been a nice addition to this set and would have filled the empty pod, made the model more movie accurate, and improved it's overall value.<br><br>Because this model is so ambiguous with regards to it's merits and it's shortfalls in it's design and presentation, I found it a little hard to score.  I give it 3/5 bricks.  It's neither so bad that you shouldn't own it, nor so good that it's the best Lego could come up with for this set.  There is certainly a lot of room for improvements.",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4

Nonetheless, this is one of my favorites, and a great deal for $10 when it came out. I actually found mine in a drug store in 2004, and got it for $5.&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Build and Playability:</h4>
<p>The build is&nbsp;easy, no doubt, for such a small set, but was fun, because even with the small piece count, Lego managed to make it as challenging as it could have been. Still in the&nbsp;earlier, more blockish parts era, this set still looks pretty sleek, and gives a whole host of nice parts, most of them red.&nbsp;Playability is limited with this set, unless you have other SW sets, but I would assume you do if you got this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>This set's only minifigure is Lobot, who is unique to this set still, although I don't know why he didn't appear in Cloud City instead. It's nice they gave us Lobot instead of a random&nbsp;person in the Cloud Car, though, because Lobot gives it value.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-14T13:01:07.03Z","LEGO Star Wars - Twin-Pod Cloud Car Review","This is one of the coolest LEGO Star Wars Episode V sets which I've put together. It's also the only set with the minifig called Lobot. Lobot has a double-printed head where you can see his face on the one side and on the other side you can see a screen. I also like the vehicle. The design and the colors of that cloud car are very awsome and I think there could have been a second minifig in this set because there're two cabins where you can put minifigs in there. The engine in the middle looks cool as well. The only problem will be that you won't find a place to store Lobot's walkie-talkie. I really can't complain about this set. The built is fun and easy and the cloud car is very sturdy too.<br><br>All

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-14T12:22:17.713Z","No I don't have a Landing Permit...","<p>Set #7119 Twin-Pod Cloud Car: What can one say about the Twin-Pod Cloud Car? I'm not sure if I can adequately describe it, but I'll sure give it a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off this set was fairly inexpensive as far as LEGO Star Wars sets go. It comes in a nice shade of red with loads of red and brown pieces used to build up this small Bespin craft from the Original Trilogy. The ship is built up rather nicely as well and it actually looks like a Twin-Pod Cloud Car, plus it has a very solid look to it once it's complete. Both cockpits can open along with a small storage compartment, or something, in the middle of the craft. Perhaps for the pilot to service the engine or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set offers up the extremely rare Lobot Mini-Figure as the pilot of this particular Twin-Pod Cloud Car. Some might question the inclusion of this character since he was never shown to be a pilot of this craft, but I suspect LEGO knew just how often he'd see release and chose him as opposed to a nameless guy. They could have included two Mini-Figures for both cockpits, but chose not to for whatever reason, still I'm not complaining, I have a Lobot and he's not easy to come by in LEGO Empire Strikes Back sets. Basically this set and I believe possibly Cloud City includes Lobot, that's it. (I could be wrong about Cloud City though.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd strongly recommend this set to all fans of LEGO Star Wars, especially if you can't afford the Cloud City at the moment, because it gives you the chance to have a fun and nifty looking LEGO Star Wars vehicle and a very hard to come by Mini-Figure for a secondary character from Empire. I don't know how much it costs in this day and age, but keeping your eyes peeled for good deals isn't a bad idea if you want a Lobot or this vehicle.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
