It is a great little set with many 1x plates. It is a solid and sturdily constructed flag that is atop my Cafe Corner as I type this. The technic pins used to give the appearance of stars is a nice touch. The amount of stripes are accurate but the set is too small to accommodate 50 stars so I can't knock this aspect. The set was highly affordable at the time of purchase and it is an easy set to create out of your spare parts. This would be a great idea for LEGO to produce flags of different nations (if they don't already). What a great marketing idea and way to show how internationally accepted the product is. Anyone from LEGO reading these reviews I wonder?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
