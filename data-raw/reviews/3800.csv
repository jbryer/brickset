It was the set episode 1 I ever brought and I played with it for ages. I was reading a DK book on the ep 1 transport and I noticed when I reached the STAPS that lego were a bit inaccurate. It had the guns and body but they did not include the foot rampo and they engines on the side of the STAP. What I liked though was the swamp and although inaccurate the STAPS were call to. By now I have thousnads of Qui-Gon Jinn torsos and Jar-Jar torsos but I was them to create othe jedi and people form the movies. I will probaly never rate a lego set under 5 and beens this was my first set I'll give this set a 7 and a half. I really liked this small set.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T12:26:00Z","More Droids and Jedi Knight!","       This a very small set, but a good one!  I like the STAPs (Single Trooper Aerial Platform). They have nice detail and are very easy to hold! The Jedi Knight is cool, you get Qui-Gon Jinn with the green light sabre, and 2 battle droids, and Jar jar Binks. One of him is fine, but twenty, is another story! The sawmp details look like underwater reef plants, so they look kinda odd. This is another good set to build up droids!

the only bad part is that lego had to but jar jar stinks in this set but luckly i found a use for him any way, i took out rocks the catapult in the Ewock Attack set and put jar jar in it and BOMBS AWAY! he went right across the living room. sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!!!!!! all in all this was a sweet set and worth the cost.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Oh well, this is from years ago.  STAPs are nice, another Qui-Gon Jinn, another Jar-Jar Binks.  Most Star Wars fans hate him, but I kind of like the guy.  The shell is really neat.

"sudorum","2009-05-17T16:41:44.543Z","Swampy? Not So Much","For a small set, I'd say this is average. It comes with a decent amount of minifigures consisting of Qui- gon, Jar- Jar, and two battle droids. Considering the time period in which this set was released, I would have to say this set is fairly decent. The small sliver of swamp that is included is really underwhelming though. I don't know why Lego chose to call it the ""Naboo Swamp"". It should have given a more proper title, such as the ""Naboo Ambush"" or ""Battle Droid attack.""",FALSE,2,2,1,1,3
"Gus_263","2008-04-04T14:33:24.78Z","Another Star Wars small","this set is another small set of the first lego Star Wars year. The set have a nice color scheme and a basic building. The four useful minifigures are two droids, Jar Jar binks and Qui gon Jinn. The droids aren't in the lego original minifigure shape, of course, but are in a good scale and design, with no much color and with details like the eyes and correct shape of the head. The Jar Jar minifigure is like other gungan minifigures, simple but with notable details. Qui Gon is one of the most rare star wars minifigures and is too simple, altough is nicely designed, that have also a cover, a cool lightsaber in green color and a hair. The droids still in two vehicles (i don't remember the real name now), that don't looks like much the same of the movie, but the minifigures stay well in it and it is playable. The few scenery builted above a blue plate is basic but with cool color scheme and pieces, looks like a simple lego style swamp. Overall the set is playable, altough have some old pieces, and it still good in design and have a simple building. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"CFL_fan777","2009-03-07T19:44:28.14Z","Naboo Swamp ","Naboo Swamp is very good for a smaller lego set. It includes four figures: jar jar binks, qui gon jinn and two battle droids with back plates. The naboo scene is very fun to build and includes two trees, three vines, seaweed and a clam. The staps are kind of bulky but are great. They fit the droids well and the triangular piece on front makes them look all the better. Overall, it is a great small lego set and the build is fun and not at all repetitive.

"knuclear200x","2009-05-20T21:21:26.53Z","""Meesa have LIGHTSABER!""","I got this as a present as with most of the sets I owned during the days before I had a job. It's a simple set with a small backdrop and four mini-figs. The backdrop's pieces aren't as advanced, mostly consisting of brown and green basic blocks with a few seaweed pieces, a few green whips and a blue plate for the ""water"". 

Now the better part of this set. The two droids come with their own attack aircrafts each consisting of two horns, rods, and transparent support so it looks like they're flying. Then there's the cloth caped Qui Gon Jinn with lightsaber and that annoying Jar Jar Binks. What's cool is that despite being annoying, he's pretty cool to have. And you can give him Qui Gon's lightsaber. His ears limit the articulation of his arms though. But being a minifig, he doesn't look as crazy or flappy as his movie counterpart so you can be creative with him or pretend lightsabering him like in the ol' vidja game ;)

So this set gets points mainly for its minifig collection, while the backdrop is simply just a backdrop or spare parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It comes with two nice STAP's which have a clear stand which makes them much cooler. This set includes two battle droids, Qui-Gon Jinn and Jar-Jar Binks. The swamp itself looks very nice as well. It's an easy build and we also get a rare shell piece which can be opened. It's a great set to have and it's also a good set for army building if you want to get it for the STAP's.<br><br>All

<p>4 minifigures make up this set, Qi Gong, Jar Jar and two Battle Droids. So it's a good ammount for the size and price, which'd factor in that while you get to Droid Attack Pods (?), you have just enough to suggest a Swamp Scene.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T22:03:49.577Z","Yousa Saved Me!","<p>Set #7121 Naboo Swamp: A small set depicting the scene from Episode One that introduced Jar-Jar Binks to the world. This set includes Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar-Jar and two Battle Droids. It is a fun little set and enhances your Episode One display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jar-Jar uses a whole new head piece, and Qui-Gon of course includes his trademark hairstyle. What you build in this set consits of a small portion of Naboo Swampland, with leafy covered tree trunks (I think.), and two STAPs. The initial version of STAPs look different compared to the newer ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this is a nice set to own, but it isn't 100% necessary for your Star Wars display, unless you happen to be a completist. Or want a lot of STAPs with various designs. The instructions also show off a few potential alternate models that can be built with the pieces in this set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
