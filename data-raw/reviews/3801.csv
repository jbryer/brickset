"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-31T06:41:09Z","A nice little set","It is quite good this set but does have many problems (they are all forgiveable):

PROS
1. Some nice piecs
2. The palace guard is a nice figure
3. Lots of hidden compartments 

CONS
1. It should seat four not two
2. Where is Panaka or at least another guard?

BUY IT IF...:
You want to have that smaller battle in Theed in your room

NO IF...:
You want to have  big battle, like the gungan one

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T12:21:27Z","Good, a fine speeder!","    This is a very nice set, but I personally wish it came with more Naboo Royal guards. It has nice green colours and an overhead light anti-infantry blaster battery! The Royal Guard is plain but has it's limits. I like the engine detail and with Destroyer Droids and battle droids, and all the other accesories from Episode 1, this can be a very nice shot!

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-08-08T05:27:12Z","Flashy!!!","After building this set, I began to wish the speeder had appeared in the film for longer than 2 seconds. This is a beautiful speeder, completely accurate and filled with cool pieces, not to mention the minifig and electro-binoculars. The detailed bits look good too, and there are plenty of alternate model ops. A great way to get your greens. It could have come with another fig though, maybe a battle droid ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-12-22T22:39:18.123Z","Ahh the Memories","This is the first set I got that came with a minifig it also got me hooked on Lego. It was about 15 dollars and came with a great selection of green parts that would be useful for building tanks and other military items. The Flash Speeder comes with one Naboo guard he has brown legs and a unique torso straight from the movie with a useful hat. He also has binoculars though it would have been nice for him to have pistol to fight of droids. 
The speeder is a quick build but the end result is very movie accurate. For controls there is a joystick and a printed slope. There are two actual seats and a decorative seat in the back which is okay since this is only a 15 dollar set. The two engines are connected to a 12 by 2 plate that runs underneath the gun for a secure connection. The gun is a simple but effective design, it can rotate 360 degrees, and is built on a hinge so you can access trunk. The trunk is huge and can hold several pairs of binoculars or guns (that weren’t included).
Overall for fifth teen dollars this is a great green parts pack though another Naboo guard would be nice even though it would bump up the cost a little. Still I would recommend buying this set if you can find it for a good price on E Bay. I have to deduct a mark because I think it should have another minifig or at least a hand held weapon for the guard featured in the set.4/5

"legolord909","2007-08-21T20:57:52.097Z","Small, but nice!","This is a fairly decent set.  One thing that Lego should have done is give it more features.  Sure it's only a 108 piece set, but I think there should just be one more little feature that would make it more interesting.  That's why I'm hoping Lego will re-release it. Make it a little bigger and have another cool feature or two.  But stil, I think it's a nice set how it is.  Small, but nice.  I'd recommend it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jon_Brick","2008-04-05T13:09:21.64Z","Cool little speeder","I remeber when my brother gave this set to me when it came out because he had bought the 7140 X-wing also and thought this was boring. I was so happy because this was my second star wars set ever and as soon as he gave it to me I started playing with this and 7121 Naboo Swamp (my first star wars set).The great thing about this set is that it comes with a rare minifig, the speeder has a little compartment, two seats (one for the gunner) and is very accurate it's also easy to handle. The only bad thing about this set is that it only has one guy but it's still good.

pros:
naboo guard
little compartment
accurate

cons: 
one guy (a extra droid would be nice)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T16:05:40.483Z","Good old small Star Wars set","This is one of the small sets of the Star Wars theme, episode 1 subtheme, released in 2000. The building have an old style that combines some old pieces and have no new features, but still cool due to the nice design, color scheme and playability. The minifigure included is a naboo pilot, simple but nicely designed and with a yellow skin. The Flash speeder building consists in a small plate used as base, with above some parts of the back and the cockpit. The back is good ixed and with few details and pieces covering,, but it is increased with a part that carries a long  but basic weapon. On the front of this part, the cockpit have a good size, can carry perfectly two minifigures, like in the movie. The front have some encurved plates and triangular blocks increasing, and with an awesome green color scheme. The set is small and have an old style of pieces, so, building, but it still in a cool design and with a nice scheme and have useful pieces, is too playable. A good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>anyway back onto the set,it also has a swivel gun a storage compartment (where you can place his binoculars)and a red gear stick in the cockpit it has some special pieces underneath so it can slide well across carpet.it cost me £15.00 on ebay which i think its original price was £9.99 which i think the price i bought it for good due to its size.its much bigger than battlepacks but was the same price(when it came out)so if you see this set chap get it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"Beskar_256","2020-10-14T20:25:17.867Z","Review 7124-1: Flash Speeder","<p>This set retailed for $10, which is around $15 in today&#39;s money. It was the first attempt by Lego at a Flash Speeder, which appears in Episode 1.</p>

<p>The box is very appealing. It shows its contents in and/or outside Theed, and it looks quite nice. The back of the box shows the minifigure taking apart the Flash Speeder. Next to it are some fun builds that can be made with the speeder, which at a helicopter and a frog. Included along with the instructions and parts is a ad for the Lego Club and a nice advertisement for other themes.</p>

<p>The build is fairly decent. It has a cannon on the top, which can barely rotate over the figures head. It is quite simple, but it is a nice feature. Lifting the cannon will revival a compartment which can store the figures accessory. There are two brown seats, but a third figure could also be squeezed in. A joystick/lever is provided as well as a nice printed piece displaying multiple screens and buttons. There is a strange gap on both sides of this, which is a little odd. The windscreen looks fine. It rests on a single large price which makes up the nose. The sides are built rather nicely, my only complaint being the exposed red. There are also prices on the bottom to allow it to slide on a surface. The model is very sturdy, which I am sure was great for play.</p>

<p>The set comes with one Naboo Security Officer who is equipped with some binoculars. The figures hat is the best they could do without making a new price, and the face is fine. The torso is the best part, as it has some nice printing on it, and the tan arms add to his outfit. He/she&#39;s accessory is fine, but a blaster would have been nice.</p>

<p>Overall, I like this set. It was made in 2000, so it does not fit the expectations for today&#39;s sets, but I think it was a nice attempt considering when it was made. A neat little set, would make a fine addition to any Lego Star Wars collection.</p>

<p>The set design is quite blocky, but it gets the point across,&nbsp;and you&nbsp;can tell what it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts in this set are quite nice! The front slope piece is unique in green to this set.</p>

<p>As for the Minifigure, it&nbsp;is quite simple looking but once again gets the point across while still looking nice. And as for the building experience, the instructions are very simple and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>
