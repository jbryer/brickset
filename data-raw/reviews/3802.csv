"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-05T01:39:10Z","Droid army builder","I agree with the review before about lego bringing out massive army sets. I'd buy a stormtrooper army set that included like 20-30 stormies but it is doubtful it will happen. Also this is useful as it gives you something to carry the droids to the battle  I wasn't sure whether to get this or the large AAT but this has the same amount of droids (give or take one, can't guarantee) and chose this. Very good design too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-24T22:50:36Z","droid carrier","Good, can get a 6 battle droids and a pilot droid for $10.00. But wouldn't it be awesome if they sold minifigiures in bulk. I mean think of the possibleties. You could have 100 battle droids for the price of 15 or 20 dollars. You could also have clone troopers, battle droids, super battle droids, scout troopers, and storm troopers numbering in the hundreds after only after only paying $50.00.
If anyone reads this, write to the LEGO company about my idea. The more people the see want this idea, the more they'll see it value in making more money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-25T17:22:13Z","Droids and more and more!","          This set is kinda like the desert skiff. It is the same type of construction and looks alike. I love all of the battle droids, although I wish therir legs could move, sometimes I like them better than men! The bay of the ship can hold 6 battle droids folded up in racking position or just droids standing up to be ferried into battle, ready for action! The droid driver is neat and comes with 7 droids in all. The carrier falls apart if hit in the middle body but otherwise, is a great in-heat transport, and with other Trade Federation vehicles, it can become a hit! 
A splendid 9.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T19:48:56Z","cool!!!!!!!!!!!!","I like this set mainly because of the  battle droids, but thats a good thing because I like them. If you get the trade federation MTT you can slide out the rack of droids on this set and put them in the MTT. Once again this is a great set and I recomend it to anyone who likes battle droids.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-24T08:28:37Z","Could have made it more interesting.","The only reason to buy this set is to get all of the battle droids and the pilot.This set has little playablity because it was only in a few seconds of the movie.It needed to be more interesting to get a 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-10T14:43:24.75Z","Recomended","This is an all time favourite set of mine. Possible the best all round army builder. When released this set was affordable, fun, and great to use. It’s very accurate in terms of representing the real thing and packs great features. The way the droids sit in the vehicle is fantastic, extremely realistic. 

It is a shame it’s not produced any more but this set can be purchased on eBay (but you will need to dig deep into your pockets) they come with a hefty price tag.

The droid carrier is a great little Piece of Lego and would make a great extra to anyone’s collection.

(Just a shame about the re make)

Anyway (still gettin' over that)  this set is an excellent army builder coming with a hard to find pilot droid.  the carrier boosts the rating b/c it includes weapons on it.  7 droids in all (70 for me) too bad the pilot didn't come with a gun.  excellent set overall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-08-13T19:57:25.647Z","&quot;If there down here, sir, we'll find them&quot;","I got this set in 2001, for the MSRP of $9.99, and I now recognise it as one of the best if not the best Lego investment decision that I have ever made. You get a huge amount of droids for your ten dollars, and also a rare pilot battle droid. This set is an excellent army builder, and a good addition to your droid army.

Pros:
-Rare blue pilot droid
-7 battle droids in all
-Fairly sturdy construction
-Realistic to the movie, in which you see it in the background
-Very price wise at MSRP (I dont know how much it is going for now, though)

Cons:
-None come to mind!

Altogether an excellent buy, and a good all around set.

"Jon_Brick","2008-04-10T20:26:17.107Z","&quot;Captain take them to camp four&quot;","This set is the dad of the droid battle pack. I got this set in 2001 and was so pleased because I only had about four battle droids. The coolest things about this set are that you can pull the rack and there are seven droids.I had a huge battle when I got home, pretending it was on Naboo (this set got blown up by the flash speeder). I can't remember how much this cost but it wasn't to much and was definitely worth it.

pros:
rack comes out
droid pilot
seven droids

cons:
can't think of any

"Gus_263","2008-03-28T13:57:03.653Z","Battle Droids...","This small set of the star wars theme includes some battle droids in a carrier, like the more new version, included in the droids battle pack. This version includes some weapons of the old style and the building is not the better, but the size makes it good. The battle droids minifigures are not totally lego minifigures, due to their likeness and hand positions, they carry their weapons in the size of their hands, but this is the better place to these minifigures carry it. The minifigures are too very poseable, and like in the movie they can shift when desactivated. The carrier have a long size but no much for these droids, without their desactivated positions, except for the commander, that stay in the front of the panel. Altough the set have no new things, this can make an great quantity of droids for increase the collection, the pieces are useful and the playability is like some other star wars sets of this size.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-08-29T17:35:23.543Z","MUCH better than the new one!","This is overall a great set and, as previously stated, much better than the new one. You get 6 regular battle droids, all with blasters, and a pilot droid which is very cool. The new one is junk, but I'm not reviewing that one, so I can't go on about it. If you are a Star Wars fan, this is a must own! Pros and Cons time!

+Pros:
+Plenty 'o droids
+Battle droid rack slides out
+Looks almost indestructible in battle
+A very classic set

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T22:09:37.96Z","Roger, Roger","<p>Set #7126 Battle&nbsp;Droid Carrier: This little vehicle does not appear in the movie as far as I can tell, though it may represent a type of vehicle that could have potentially been there in a quick shot or something. All I know is it is not the same as owning the giant MTT sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said it is a fast way to build up an army of Battle Droids. And by including a few of them next to the MTT you can enhance the overall look of any display. I am a bit worried though that the Battle Droids' hands will snap and break every time I build this set back up again, due to the way the figures are stored, but with all the spare Droid arms you get in every set which includes them it isn't that difficult to replace broken and cracked arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually don't mind the older version of the Blaster weapon, with it you can take the Battle Droids from this set and insert them into a Space Theme display and they fit right in, not like the newer blaster pieces from the new sets. I'd say if you are interested in this set you can't go wrong with owning it, the build is quite fun and the little droid carrier is a nice display piece.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
