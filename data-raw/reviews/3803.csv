I was thrilled to Finally have a chicken walker, Enough about me and lets get back to the set. The AT-ST has a really cool walking feature and guns that move down to shoot ground targets. You also get a walking hairball [Im talking about Chewy] which has great detail and is a great fig to have. Its a shame it didnt come with a few Stormtroopers or even a speeder bike. If you have the Ewok Attack Youve got the Battle for Endor. But sometimes the walker can fall down on carpet, Besides that, get it, its great set to have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Its amazin, you don't need to list everything down but...:
*Chewy
*I clever disign
*Some nice detail
*The cockpit, nice and roomy
*That nice little brick inside the cockpit showing another walker (similer to the one inside the snowspeeder showing the AT-AT)

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-03T20:18:04Z","cool","I got my moneys worth on this one ,heck I bought three!

       Ok let's evaluate this from the head to the feet. 
         The head while not being the most attractive thing has death and destruction written all over it.
I love the rotating knobs on top and then the legs , able to move freely and adjustable so...

               pros
             1. this thing is a walking death machine awesome to make your friends open thier eyes at the recreated battle scene with the Ewoks at the moon.

               Cons
              1.Coming from my standpoint, I now have three chewbaccas, I would like it much better to have a storm trooper drive it.


               In Conclusion...

                 Two thumbs up I like it and I don't care about anyone's complaints because I know this ship isn't made cheaply and has a bad design like the new x-wing fighter and the snowspeeder. and if I had sixty pounds or whatever that is equivelent to in dollars, I would buy more(if they were still out)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Nice colors are used. What I find a bit disappointing is the small &quot;head&quot;, it could have been made a little bigger. But this isn't very important once you see that the thing is well constructed, I like the way the legs move. Plus you get a chewie fig, that you can otherwise get with the much more expensive falcon...but as already said by someone else, what should I do with 3 chewies?? Lego should have either replaced the wookie with a trooper or sold the AT-ST with a trooper AND a wookie.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-27T10:11:15Z","Not the best ever.","I got this set for christmas and I was so suprised at how lego didn't seem to have put a lot of effort into it.  Of course I can't say I didn't like it, it's just that I could hardly recognize what the creation was supposed to be without reading the set names(AT-ST).  I guess I got bored of it because I used the pieces of 2 AT-STs(I got 2 for christmas, my parents knew it was my favorite vehicle in star wars)and built a whole endor dioroma.  My new custom AT-ST is so much cooler and detailed. Anyways don't get this set if you like sets to be movie detailed.  Get this set if you don't care what it looks like and like the Chewy fig.  I'll be nice and call it a 9/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T10:49:38Z","Fun, but lacking something...","That something, of course, is some Imperials! Where are they? While I appreciated the inclusion of Chewie in this set, as a cheaper alternative to paying way over the odds to get him with the old Millennium Falcon kit, I think the relatively small size of the set definitely would've warranted the inclusion of a second minifigure - like an Imperial driver or stormtrooper. Afterall, you can never have too many stormtroopers! As for the model itself, I think it's just dandy. Just about the right size in relation to the figures, and the minor innacuracies (like the oddly misplaced chin guns and non-swivelling head) were easily remedied with some spare parts from my Lego box. All in all it was a perfectly good set and a nice addition to any Star Wars Lego collection, but it could've been so much more...",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T20:07:32Z","Sweet","This AT-ST is wicked, espiecally because you can play with it alot and you can make it attack either the ewoks on endor and the snowspeeders on hoth. I think this set is wicked and I think its great lego made chewie come with it but I think it would have been better to include at least one Imperial driver and two ewoks. The face is detailed and the interior is o.k. 

Pluses:
* Chewie
* Nice set
* Cool features all over

Minus:
* No Imperial driver or ewoks
* Only one seat
* the head doesn't swivel around like in the movie.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-31T20:29:57Z","Nice Imperial Walker!","     I got this set for my birthday! I have just finished it and it is a quick build! One thing I instantaneously demised was that the walker came with Chewie! I was seriously hoping an Imperial Walker pilot would come up, but darn! I made a sub-accurate substitution for Chewie. The Walker is a bit skinny but the walking system works like a charm! It uses an interesting mechanism for the backward hatch! It has several unique pieces like the feet stabilizers, the backward hatch, and the control panel which shows another Imperial Walker in the aiming beacon. Anyway, it is a charming set and I would alloy anyone to use it! A good addition to your Star Wars collection or Imperial force!

pros...

-it looks like an atst u can tell obviously
-it has cool guns and it actually has traditional pieces not these new strange ones
-chewie must i say more?
-the legs are pretty sweet and mive nicly

cons...

-1 seat
-too colorful of an interior, i mean common yellow?
-not really &quot;chin guns&quot; more like mustash guns
-head cant swivel
-not very accurate according to the real at-st",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Tha 'baby' walker seen briefly in The Empire Strikes Back (ESB) and more fully in The Return Of The Jedi (ROTJ) the AT-ST is another of the classic Star Wars vehicles.  This set, unfortunately, is not a classic: the colour scheme is wrong, the head is a little too small and the legs, while they do allow the model to walk, cause it lean backwards.  Also, for some reason, the set comes with Chewie rather than an Imperial pilot.  For a better AT-ST, go for set number 7657 instead.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It has all the great playability that you would expect from Lego without being over-complicated with nobs and gears.

"AETerry","2011-02-20T02:08:20.057Z","Imperial AT-ST","<p>I can just see the scene that this reenacts from Return of the Jedi when Chewie's taken over the AT-ST and helping turn the tide of battle in terms of fire power for the Rebels &amp; Ewoks. Ya' get Chewie, so that in itself is well worth it for classic Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build isn't bad and works good for the pieces availabe for it's day and looks like the Mech it's meant to be. As a collector, this set has been well worth picking up and putting in my Lego collection, particularly with what I have for Star Wars.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-14T13:14:26.84Z","The Rebels are Fleeing into the Woods Commander","<p>Set #7127 Imperial AT-ST: Another cheap set from Return of the Jedi this is my first AT-ST and a fairly interesting looking LEGO Vehicle when next to other LEGO Vehicles on display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is Chewbacca the only Mini-Figure with this set though, is something someone most assuredly has asked. Well I say, why not? True if they'd included just an Impreial AT-ST Driver or both the set might have made more sense, but as is this set is great for what it is after all Chewbacca was one of the harder to come by Mini-Figures even in this day and age, so getting him with a cheap, out-of-scale AT-ST is better than not getting him at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AT-ST as I said is admittedly out of scale, compared to the larger and more impressive AT-STs that followed, but there is more than one size of AT-ST I'd imagine and besides this was an earlier attempt at giving us the much coveted Chicken Walker and is deserved of existing for that fact alone. I enjoy the set quite well for what it is and am not dissapointed with it in the slightest. It enhances my Endor display until such time as I get The Battle of Endor (Hopefully soon.) and I also get to have the much sought after Chewbacca. (I hear Jabba even has a bounty out on him.) ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that for what it is, this set is pretty good and if you're looking for some nice parts/pieces to build up another AT-ST walker, this is a good place to start fo MOCers. It's also a must have if, like me, you're interested in collecting the entire run of LEGO Star Wars sets including Mini-Figures. However it is a bit blockier compared to the more modern AT-STs that have followed, so if you'd rather have a streamlined version perhaps trying to track down the set from 2007 would be better. Still you can't go wrong if you're in need of a Chewbacca.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Beskar_256","2021-01-04T03:51:27.88Z","Not a bad first attempt, but has flaws.","<p>I don&#39;t have the box, but I do have the instructions. On the back, there is a interesting ad for the old Star Wars technic figures. The last page in the manual is a real treat, it shows lots of old sets! There are more on the next page, going back to 1999!</p>

<p>Starting with the build, I&#39;m going to start with the feet. The feet look fine, but they have a lot of brown and tan. This is an issue present throughout the set, but it does not make it look bad. It may be inaccurate, but it makes it look less plain. The legs have a lot of articulation when compared to the recent At-St. My least favourite part is the missing &ldquo;body&rdquo;. The part were the legs and head connect is gone, and two technic bricks replace it. They did this to add a walking feature. It works well, and despite being inaccurate, the walking motion look decent. The head is pretty interesting. It is purely brick build. The two main guns only go down, and the two guns on the side move too much. Those are not massif problems, especially the two front canons. The back opens up in a strange but good way. It&#39;s a bit to colourful for my tastes. There is a really cool inverted slope element that show an At-St being targeted.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifig is the old Chewy, and there is not that much to say. He looks good for his time, but could be improved.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I should give this a 3-star rating, maybe even 2, but its age makes up for it. This vehicle has been made many times, so this set is a really nice look back at Lego history. It&#39;s just cool. I&#39;m very happy to have it. I would have like some more minifigs though.</p>
