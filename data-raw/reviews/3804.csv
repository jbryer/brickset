That makes this set - it's obvious that the Luke &amp; 'tree' was a bit of an afterthought.  All the storm troopers in the movies look cool, and the scouts from RotJ are no exception.

Lego have revised the construction of the speeder bikes a bit since this set came out, so they look a little different from the one that comes with Ewok Attack, but it's still cool to have.

Yet another Luke - with black hand and lightsabre - is a nice addition, but not really a deal maker.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

(You can tell by the wig he is wearing).    Just the two bikes + figs would have been enough. One of those rare times lego puts too much figs in a box and a silly tree. Just buy this one for the bikes en scout troopers and you won't be disapointed. (I got a little lego SW poster in the box,nice)My review would have been a 7+ or an 8-.

Boy, I love those guys, they are so cool! The best part is that you can get two speeder bikes. Get a collection of these babies and build a little army. Luke comes too. He is wearing an unusual garb, some grey/black shirt or something. He has one of his advanced light sabers and is about to attack some biker. I am glad that lego didnt include lego Ewoks. I lovem in the movie, but plastic ones just dont looks straight. 
  I like the luke head, I would much raher get him in an X-wing or something.  Overall good, I love the starwars stuff. Get this if you like the speeder boys and luke. A decent 9, just the size.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T11:11:17Z","Ah, memories...","This one gets the ol` nostalgia flowing. The Speeder Bikes were the first Star Wars set I got my hands on, and they were a great introduction to the range. Back in the days before the wonderful, divine Stormtrooper minifigure, this was the only way to collect lots of Imperial soldiers, in the form of the two Scout Troopers. I'd say it's a safe bet I'm not the only one who still has a big surplus of little Luke Skywalkers as a result of repeat-buying this to build up my Imperial army. The Speeder Bikes themselves are great, although they were later much improved in the Ewok Attack set. But still, you got TWO of them, which was great as it let me recreate the Endor speeder bike chase. Also included was a piece of nodescript Endorian shrubbery, which was a bit blocky and boring but a good source of hard-to-find brown Lego bits. 

All in all, this was a little gem - many hours of fun to be had with the contents of just one small, cheap set. The only downside I can think of is that the steering vanes tended to fall off and get lost, and even now I still don't know what to do with all those darn Luke Skywalkers! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-15T16:10:26Z","A set of me!","       This set is very nice. I wish there was a set of all Imperial things but that somehow isnt possible. The biker scouts are very cool and so are the speeder bikes, although I hate it in the movie when they make farm-boy Luke Skywalker beat up these scouters but thats movies, in real life the bikers would have wiped the floor with him! The Luke is pretty neat but I dont get the one-hand black/white deal. He has the new light saber in neon green and wears his black slip-on robes. The little rock and tree thing is worthless but anyways, it is cool! I would like to have an army of scout troopers but I am working on my stormy number, I so far have 14 stormies, which is a little bit compared to what I have to have. This is a superior 10 because it has biker scouts, the snipers of the Empire!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The hair of Luke is a simple lego original hair with white/gray color. The bodies of the figures are simple but nice designed. Luke also have a green lightsaber, in a awesome lego style.

The build is very fun for the forest scene but the speeder bikes can get a bit repetitive (not as bad as linking chains though). The backpacks on the back of the speeder bikes are a nice touch and the folding landing gear on them works well too (landing gear on the front it is the grey cylinder). The forest scene is very small. It has just enough room for luke and a tree. The instuctions are a bit blurry for the making of the tree. In this lego set you recieve two imperial scout troopers and one luke figure (wearing endor torso). The speeder bikes are a bit bulky but they still fit together very well.

"whaleyland","2013-01-09T15:23:41.51Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: Speeding Around the Redwoods","<p>
 Only one scene from Return of the Jedi made it into the inaugural run of Star Wars LEGOs back in 1999. That scene was the iconic speeder bike chase through the Endor forest. Although much has changed in later speeder designs, the overall look has changed little.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Innovations: Taking advantage of the new LEGO laser strut used on the Snowspeeder and X-Wing sets, the speeder bikes use two each to link the back portion of the bike to the maneuvering flaps in the front. Snowshoes from the Ice Planet 2002 series act as the repulsorlifts underneath, while a backpack rounds out the rear. Overall, the set did a great job of showcasing what a speeder bike looks like.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Lack of Inspiration: Despite the success of the set, the speeders do appear rather bulky compared to their legitimate brethren from the film, and the small tree that Luke stands by is a joke at best. The branches are not suggestive of the types of trees found on Endor, and the brick-built trunk is more like a pile of brown squares. The laser canons underneath the speeders also leave a lot to desire, especially since LEGO doubles them as forward supports when the speeders are not whooshing.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 What It Got Right: The set still got the feel right. Two speeders were an excellent choice, since one just would make the set seem cheap. And at a price point of $9.99, the set wasn&#39;t too overpriced for including three figures. While the tree is lame, it provides the right environment all the same by grounding the speeders into a specific setting. The art on the box further reinforces this in a way that sets today don&#39;t always accomplish.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Possible Improvements: Rounding the speeder off has been tried in numerous later models, all to mixed results. The problem is that being only two-studs wide, the set cannot really sacrifice any more space for rounding. And because minifigure&#39;s legs don&#39;t spread, they cannot adequately straddle the bike like the scout troopers do in the film. This is something that can probably never be corrected, at least not at this scale. The decorative tree would have been better with a simple triangular branch rather than the tropical fern, and the trunk should have been made of rounded bricks rather than square ones.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigures: When this released, all three minifigures were new and unique to this set. Indeed, the two scout-troopers were the first stormtroopers available until the TIE Fighter set released in 2001 with a standard-issue trooper. That makes the figures in this set extra special. And they were well-done too. There is no doubt that the troopers represent those from the film, and LEGO even went the extra distance to provide the figures with real faces behind their visors, showing a stern expression beneath their visored eyes. Luke Skywalker, on the other hand, appears downright generic, but the inclusion of his green lightsaber (rather than the blue included with his other sets) and his Endor clothing still make his entry important.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 How it Compares: Speeder bikes have been made and remade numerous times over the years, the second generation appearing in 2002&#39;s Ewok Attack (7139) set. In that model, the basic build was followed, though the top of the bike was streamlined better with a curved piece, and the back used a slightly different, though unimpressive, race-car piece. 2009 introduced the current version of the speeder bike, and one that accomplishes a bit more detail at the cost of pre-built pieces. Almost the entire bulk of the set has been replaced with a three-wheeler chassis, while the forks are no longer laser struts. Still, it doesn&#39;t look any closer to a film speeder than this initial version. 2003 began the strange habit of including snowtroopers on speeder bikes at the Battle of Hoth, and to count, there are virtually the same number of &quot;snow&quot;speeders as there are standard-issue models. Sets in 2003, 2010, 2011, and 2013 all included a white speederbike, while sets in 2011 and 2012 included Endor-stylized speeders. It&#39;s only a matter of time until LEGO begins making desert, water, and other types of speeders. But in the end, and for all the additional curvature, the original speeder bikes do the job just fine. They blend in with the later models almost seamlessly, and are fairly simply to build from second-hand parts...minus the figures of course.</p>

<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The booklet is LEGO's easy, clear illustrated step-by-step instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 93 pieces, so the $10 for this set that it retailed at the time feels very reasonable. Most of the pieces go for the speeder bikes.<br></p>
