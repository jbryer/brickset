"A_Brickset_user","2000-10-05T00:00:00Z","","Pros:
Lots of really cool pieces, and a good ammount of parts for the money.
The model is fun to build, and looks great.  Its pretty swooshable.
I like the figures, one of which has an old-fashioned smile.  And another person has a brown visor!
No landing gear, so no comlaints in that department.
The entire concept- you don't see a lot of LEGO Space fighters that have places for two figures or a rear defense system.

Cons:
Without any badguys, its not much of a stand alone set.  Better get a Droid Fighter or something.
Confusion over where to put the lightsaber's blade when it is being stored.

Overall: I highly reccommend it, you will like the way it is built.

"A_Brickset_user","2002-03-31T00:00:00Z","","Ah, winter 1999, I can still remember the day I walked those cold aisles of TRU, looking for a models to suit my tastes, when I finally set my eyes on one, the last model at the store. As I neared the set, I could see another customer out of the corner of my eyes, heading for it too. Luckily, I got my hands on it first, and I never regretted it. This set is everything Lego should be, accurate, nicely priced, and a lot of bricks and plates for alternate building. Not only that, but It's one of the first Star Wars sets, too, making it a great choice for a plethora of assorted parts in gray and orange, perfect for thr space theme. The model itself isn't too large, and fits perfectly on a shelf, and even comes with an awesome Hoth Trooper, which would also fit well for rogue army, if you wanted to stock up on them. The Snowspeeder comes with new orange and clear gray elements to expand possible building, and makes for a great source of parts. The only downside? This set is nearly impossible to find as of now, and you may spend a nice thirty to forty dollars to get your hands on one MISB. A prime candidate for the best set of 1999, and a reflection of what Lego should be. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-10T00:00:00Z","","My favorite of all the Star Wars sets.  What I like most about this set is the small size, but great detail and placement for two figs.  Ships twice as large can't hold two people.  I love the three figs esp. the Hoth soldier.  I'm not big on Star Wars sets but this is just a neat set.  I also like the Rebel cannon.  I regret not buying a few more of these.  I don't have an AT-AT but this would be great to recreate the Battle of Hoth.  Only one recommendation: I would have loved a working harpoon or at least a piece that attaches to the ship with a string!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

LEGO Star Wars sets do hardly come any better than this set. An instant classic in the LEGO Star Wars toy line-up and even popular with Star Wars fans who are not into LEGO.

Of course it fails on a few parts; two cockpits instead of one, it might be a bit too big, maybe the nose is not spot-on.  Yet, this set is 100% Star Wars, and a favourite of many

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-23T04:27:42.293Z","LEGO Star Wars - Snowspeeder Review","This snowspeeder is one of my favourite LEGO snowspeeders which LEGO made. I don't have the other versions of this set but I think this snowspeeder has the best design. It's an easy built and it's very sturdy too. You also don't get any stickers which you've to put on. I like the three minifigs which you get in this set We get a cool looking rebel soldier with a white helmet and a brown visor. I also like the markings on the face of that soldier. You also get a gun and a binoculars for him as well. The other minifig is Luke Skywalker with his pilot uniform and his co-pilot Dack Ralter. The only thing which I don't like about Dack Ralter is that LEGO just gave him a basic smiley face. This set comes with a turret which sviwels full 360° as well.<br><br>The snowspeeder is very cool as I told you. The fins on each side are movable and you get a blaster on each side. The two cockpits where you can put in the pilots opens very nice as well. I also like the screens with the AT-AT walkers which you get in the cockpits. The back has a sviwel turret as well and some cool engines. There's also a place where you can store Luke's lightsaber handle. I can't really complain much about this set.<br><br>All

"whaleyland","2012-01-05T04:06:28.6Z","LEGO as an AfterThought: Simply Too Many Snowspeeders","<p>One of the inaugural sets of the LEGO&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;series, the Rebel Snowspeeder introduced the world of LEGO to the planet Hoth. It was simple and it was inelegant but it was the only snow speeder Hoth fans had for five years. It&#39;s enemy, the AT-AT, was not released until 2003, though an AT-ST set was released at the same time as this set.</p>

<div><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>This set had few true innovations over previous non-<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;sets. It used fairly standard components throughout to get the fee of the snow speeder. Of it&#39;s new parts&mdash;namely the canopy and the blasters&mdash;both were used adequately for the task, which is apparent since both are still used in the same capacity in the three subsequent snow speeder sets.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Lack of Inspiration:&nbsp;</b>The real failure of this set is in the lack of sleekness. Surely, cost was a factor in the design but still the ship just appears blocky. Most dangerously, though, it deviates from the actual vehicle it is attempting to replicate in some major ways. An important aspect of the snow speeder is the single long cabin in which the pilot and gunner can communicate. This set does not only skip that, but adds a bulky canister (to hold the lightsaber handle) between the two cabins, significantly separating them. Additionally, the bottom of the set uses a long and wide plate that lacks any inspiration.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>What it Got Right:&nbsp;</b>On the plus side, the vehicle still looks more or less like a snow speeder. It&#39;s color scheme, though boring, matches that of the real speeders seen in&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;much better than the later white models. It&#39;s guns are well fitted and are believable, and the detail of the moveable rudders on the wings are perfectly done. In addition, the Atgar Laser Cannon gives a sense that there is more going on here than meets-the-eye. It&#39;s a shame that this set had to wait three years for an opponent to defeat.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b>One very important improvement that this set needed was an actual winch and tow cable assembly on the back. All the successive sets included one but this did not. An elongated canopy that connected the two cabins would also have been more true to the films and provided a more realistic build. Lastly, the addition of rounded disks on the bottom would have provided the set with the &quot;zoom&quot; factor that kids are always looking for with these sort of sets. As it currently is, the set just kind of grinds along on the ground.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;</b>As an introductory set, three minifigures is not a bad pull, especially since one is Luke Skywalker with a lightsaber. Luke&#39;s figure is identical to the one found in 7140 X-Wing Fighter and comes with the same blue lightsaber accessory. His torso and legs are a generic Rebel pilot body (still in use today). His helmet and face are unique to this figure. The second figure is Luke&#39;s gunner, Dack Ralter. His is one of the most generic figures in the entire&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;line with a generic smily face, standard Rebel pilot body, and a white helmet with simple blue Rebel symbols on each side. The Echo Base Trooper was new to this set and had a new torso depicting winter gear. His face was an old Ice Planet 2002 mold with an Adventurers helmet and brown Space visor. His macrobinoculars and blaster rifle match the theme of this set perfectly.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>How it Compares:&nbsp;</b>Compared to the other sets, this one is probably the ugliest of the bunch. It got some things right, such as the color, the use of the canopy and the cannons, and the flexible rudders, but it also got a lot wrong. The 2004 reincarnation of this set was an improvement in many respects, though other aspects, such as the Atgar Cannon and the coloring, went amiss. The version included with Hoth Rebel Base improved on some of the 2004 flaws, while the Hoth Wampa Cave version was almost an exact duplicate of that set.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">FINAL COMPARATIVE SCORE: 4th Place among Snowspeeders</font></b></div>

<div><b>FINAL QUALITY SCORE: 6/10&nbsp;</b>(It gets the look but fails in the details)</div>

"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-31T17:04:45.467Z","Snowspeeder flies past turrent (Which I may say, rocks!)","Ok, my favorite thing about this set: THE TURRENT! It's awesome, spins, and I added a my own bunker (Made with white pieces), and the rebel trooper really has a sweet-looking face. 

The snowspeeder has an...unusual design. The two spaces (Pilot and co-pilot seats) are made seperately with a wall between them (Much unlike the real thing from The Empire Strikes Back). 

Price is very good, considering parts and build (I actually got it for $40, and still think it was worth that). Here are some Pros and Cons to summarize this set:

Pros:

1. Snowspeeder is very sturdy

2. Both cockpits open well, and minifigures fit well inside

3. Luke, Dak, and a trooper! All this set is really missing is a snowtrooper!

4. Mondular Build

5. Turrent is great!

Cons:

1. Seperate rooms for pilots, unlike movie

2. Turrent does break sometimes, especially the very front gun

All in all, this set gets a 4.5/5. Great set, easy build, good for younger children too. I recommend this set to any LEGO Star Wars fan, though not if you want the Hoth Rebel Base (That set's snowspeeder is alot more realistic, but breaks more).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-20T20:58:27.81Z","Snowspeeder Review","<p>I had quite a bit of fun getting this set and putting it together. One of the Classic Starwars vehicles at a considerably affordable rate. Three minifigures, you can't beat that. And the snowspeeder looks fairly realistic and true to the vehicle it's based on from Empire Strikes Back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I might have done differently is cut the third minifigure and that little radar build and have the set focus soley on and feature the Snowspeeder. Still, it's a great classic set and vehicle.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"ra226","2012-03-01T18:48:51.17Z","Good, 1st gen SW set.  Holds up well against newer versions","<p>This is another ""1st generation"" Star Wars set, though compared to the others of this era, the Snowspeeder is perhaps the best interpretation. &nbsp;The colors look good and the form is decent, too.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pretty good interpretation on the design (compare to the Y-Wing... ugh...)</li><li>Good color scheme--no inexplicable reds, blues, or yellows sticking out.</li><li>Comes with both minifigs, plus rebel defense gunner</li><li>No stickers</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No winch/cable</li><li>Luke &amp; Dack are not directly back to back</li><li>Useless compartment amidships--holds lightsaber handle but not blade (??)</li><li>A couple of easy details aren't quite right: engines, etc</li><li>Underside is rather uncreative--just a big plate</li></ul>
<p>The wings don't slope past the nose like they should (and do on the newer version, set 4500), but they still look fine. &nbsp;The engines are also not quite right as they should just be directly behind the guns and could have been done fine with just a 2x2 round brick. &nbsp;There's also no decent place to store Luke's lightsaber. &nbsp;(There's a compartment in the middle of the ship, but only the handle will fit there--the blade has to be stashed with Dack--careful with that, man!)</p><p>Still, these are easy enough to ignore--the ship looks good, and is deceptively well proportioned despite my doubts after seeing the giant plate that is the base of the model. &nbsp;And Lego had an annoying habit of using inexplicably ""loud"" colors unnecessarily during this era--this model does not suffer from that (unlike the 7150 Y-Wing with its red hilights).</p><p>The only glaring shortcoming in this set is the lack of a winch and tow cable. &nbsp;Lego really dropped the ball here and missed a huge playability opportunity. &nbsp;What's a kid going to want to do with this set? &nbsp;Wrap the tow cable around the legs of the nearest AT-AT, of course.</p><p>Aside from the lack of tow cable, this is a good set and in my opinion, the only one from this era that holds up well against the later redesigns.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"ChickenNWaffles","2016-01-24T04:15:51.127Z","One of the best Snowspeeders to date!","<p>This is a very nice set! Especially if you can get it under $40. I got this for $35 and I&#39;m quite content with it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box art is very nice! The front shows the set with some snow and an AT-AT leg behind the&nbsp;snowspeeder. The back of the box shows the&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;disassembling the&nbsp;snowspeeder&nbsp;and also shows alternative builds for the set.&nbsp;I appreciate how back then the sets included a cardboard insert so pieces won&#39;t roll around. Instructions are fairly good. Sometimes I missed steps because the were very inconspicuous. On the top of every page shows a scene from the Battle of&nbsp;Hoth. It gets me excited for the completed model so I can recreate scenes I just saw. Very nice touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Since this was a set from old times, there are no &quot;groundbreaking&quot; parts contained in this set. There are no stickers which is great! &nbsp;My favorite piece of this set is a 2x2 slope with an AT-AT printed on it to make it look like there is an AT-AT headed towards you. There are great pieces in here for MOCs and some really nice bright orange parts!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigs! The best part of a set in my opinion!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luke Skywalker: Ok minifig. He has his standard bored looking head that is found in a lot of yellow face Star Wars sets. His helmet has nice printing which is fairly close to the movie. His torso and legs are the same as every rebel pilot up until the redesign in 2010.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dak Ralter: I feel like I could take on the whole empire!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m always happy to have a Dak Ralter. This minifigure&nbsp;of him is as basic as it gets. He has a standard Rebel Pilot helmet which has two blue rebel symbols printed on both sides of his helmet. He has that standard smile seen on a lot of old minifigures and on the Creator Modular Buildings minifigures. His pilot suit is the same as Luke&#39;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hoth Rebel: Pretty good minifig. His head is an interesting pick for Star Wars. He has the standard smile but with eyebrows and red hair hanging near his eyes. That head appeared mostly in&nbsp;Aquazone sets. Torso and legs wise, I&#39;m not sure why they are grey. After watching Epsiode 5, Hoth troopers wear tan or white suits, I find it hard to tell. I like the helmet but not the visor. Again, not sure why they included a brown visor. The 2004 redesign has more realistic white goggles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The satellite dish was extremely simple as it only used a couple of pieces. The snowspeeder didn&#39;t require any complex building and was simple but enjoyable. It was a good relaxing build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set looks great! In The Empire Strikes Back, the snowspeeders&nbsp;look more gray than white so I think this one is more accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is well worth it for $20-$35! I got mine for $35 and I&#39;m well pleased. This set has great playability! It&#39;s easy to pick up fly around! Good minfigures, great parts, awesome playability! If you have the chance to purchase this set, get it!</p>
