"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-23T00:50:43Z","Its Got Its Ups And Downs","The Pod looks really nice and picies dont fall of easy. Theres just one problem. I really dont like the Big long Tan coloured piece that holds it all together. It shold be clear besides that its good detail. I also think Anikan should have the short legs. This way he looks like a kid.[i used Dobbys legs on him from harry potter]. The Droid is a bit Flimsy but very good. And Padmey is o.k. but nothing special. I would only get this if you really like the Podracers.[ i got mine as a preasent, other wise i wouldent of got it]. And if you dont have enough money to get the set Boonta Eve Podrace. So its this sets a 5. Nothing more, Nothing less",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T10:00:06Z","ok but you should just get Mos Espa Pod Racing set.","This was my first Star Wars Lego set ever and it was really cool back then but now its not all that great, mainly because your better off to get the Mos Espa Podracing set instead because at least you get more then one racer cause then you can acuuly have a race. But I did like engines and the...heck the whole set looks pretty good and accurate to the movie. but since I got the bigger pod racing set I took apart this set and used some parts of this set to make Anakins Jedi Starfighter from the Clone Wars cartoon. all in all this set was pretty good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T18:00:54Z","Nice pod racer!","       I laways have liked pod-racers and this is a good set to get one. It aint that expensive and it comes with one of the best pods, although Sebulba's, Gasgano's, and Quadrinaro's racers are much larger and involved. I like the flaps on the engines and the cannon pieces to serve as power couplings. The pod is cool and you get Anakin with the Tatooine garb, Padme Neberrie, and a pit droid! The racer is very nice ut I wish it didnt have those tan pieces to support the cockpit/engines! Anyway, this is a nice set and if you noly want one pod racer, this is the set for you!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2006-03-08T14:45:29Z","pretty cool...","especially those big engines in front (i can hear the fat sound just by looking at them ;-) )! if you remove the tan plates which are just to stabilize the whole thing, and use some transparent parts like panels or bricks the pod will look much more elegant and realistic. of course you need padme and young anakin with freckled cheeks.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedi_Master_Fangorn","2007-06-12T20:27:54.56Z","Great solid Podracer!","Compared with the other podracer's from Watto's Junk Shop set, this is a classic.  It actually stays together, and comes with 2 figures, Padme and Anakin.  This was I think the only set that Padme came in, and a really smart-looking pit droid (as far as pit droids go-not far).  Probably the best part of the podracer itself is that the flaps on the front can open and close.  A great set, the podracer cannot be improved upon.  Congratulations Lego, another solid, swooshable job well done!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legostarwarsfan12345","2009-10-04T23:18:08.543Z","hmmm","I'd buy this, its detailed and comes with Padm'e, but I still think Padm'e's going to come in a star wars the clone wars set and she'll look better, if your going to buy this for Padm'e, well dont, I got a feelin theres a set coming with a better looking Padm'e soon.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-13T05:31:23.987Z","LEGO Star Wars - Anakin's Podracer Review","This is a great set for little money. What I think is a little bit weird is that LEGO put this podracer in two different sets (the Mos Espa Podrace and this set which I'm reviewing). I think they did that because some people weren't able to buy the bigger podracer set. The old podracer doesn't have so many details as the newer ones but it still has some cool play value. There're also no stickers in this model which makes the pieces we get here more valuable. The yellow fins of the engines are movable and the minifig fits in the cockpit very nice and easy. We also get a flag in this set.<br><br>I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set. We get Padmé in Tatooine style from the episode I movie and she's only included in the podracer sets. We also get Anakin Skywalker in episode I style with this tan sweater, tan pants and his gray helmet. This model also includes a pit droid. Actually it's not a real minifig but I think it is. The podracer set is a nice and easy built and this model is very sturdy. I don't have anything to complain about this model.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Phantom","2011-01-04T18:48:36.833Z","A simple set from a non-complicated time!","<p>This is generally a small set, most likely cost £10(or $10-15 in the USA) which in my opinion is purely awesome.<br/>If your collection mostly consists of the newer star wars sets, you will probably critizise this magnificent little set that it isnt 'sleek', too blocky and the tan parts they put to help it hold together.<br/>Whilst i too agree that this set could instead have been constructed with clear pieces for the stands instead as they may match the sands of tatooine, they most certainly dont match my carpet!<br/><br/>This set lacks of what is now known as 'playability' but im instead grateful that there was a time without those stupid technic mechanisms or flick fires to make a set look like preschool toys!<br/>The flaps can move and that is all i would expect from a marvellous model like this so you could change the way it looks.(a pro for people who display sets)<br/><br/>The figures are generally OK for the time and nowadays they tend to look ancient to a modern collector.(they definetly needed more detail)<br/>Padme specificly looks unique in every way but to be honest, dosent resemble her very well and im still confused as to why they have not re-made her. Even a clone wars version would please me, heck, she's one of the main characters and has appeared in the tv series twice as much as other characters who were made into figs!<br/>Obviously there is something preventing LEGO from creating that fig again.<br/>Anakin is typical(a little dumb in my opinion) and has general torso printing depicting his slave robes, nothing special.<br/>The pit droid is too chunky and does not resemble a pit droid at all, he's also got no tools and i dont even know why he's even there! To stand around and watch maybe?<br/><br/>Now some of the bad points about this.</p>
<p>Lego were clearly to lazy to produce a purple energy beam so they left us with common trans orange instead, which i think makes the podracer seem alittle dumb but i guess trans orange is better than normal orange or whatever.<br/>The little flag is generally a pointless addition to this set and has no use apart from ending up somewhere in the bottom of your brick bucket!<br/><br/>Well, now to sum up my review!<br/>If you find this for a decent price, ide say get it but dont go too overboard as LEGO will be producing a new anakin's podracer which will most certainly feature a better designed and sleeker podracer but this is always going to be a legend in my eyes!<br/><br/></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"FloridaEggplant","2011-01-25T18:17:44.197Z","Good for Podracing","<p>This set is good for building a podrace, I used it for a podrace, I even made a stadium.&nbsp;This is the only set I own (from 1999) that is not broken, but its lego, it is a building&nbsp;toy, its sometimes supposed to break. Even without the handle, it does not fall apart,the solution is using 2 <a href=""http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/2780"">Technic pins (with friction slots)</a>, you connect 4 lasers with them.&nbsp;The minifigs are good,but they are remaking the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7962-1"">Mos Espa podrace, in 2011</a>, I predict that there will be better minifigs. &nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<div>-Minifigs</div>
<div>-Racer</div>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<div>-The flag pole fall down a lot.</div>
<div>-The podracer is fine without the handle.</div>
<div>-The pit droid should look like the one in Lego Star Wars:The Complete Saga.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Overall, this set is good for podracing, I predict better minifigs in 2011.&nbsp;</div>

"peti7788","2022-05-25T22:41:20.773Z","The best thing in Phantom Menace","<p>Pod racing...&nbsp;I loved it! The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNMS5G1lyZc"" target=""_blank"">video game</a> too!&nbsp;It was a very good idea to combine the style of ancient chariot racing&nbsp;with futurism.&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus#/media/File:Plan_Rome_Caen_Circus_Maximus_Colis%C3%A9e.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Circus Maximus</a> on the planet Tatooine. Excellent!</p>

<p>So I had to buy a set like this. Even the first version did pretty well, despite being quite angular.&nbsp;The only thing that&rsquo;s not my favorite is the big special engine piece, the same one that was used with the Naboo fighter.&nbsp;But that was the only way to keep the price of the set low.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>The mechanic droid was a good decision, funny.&nbsp;In addition to Anakin, Padm&eacute; also performs well in this set. It&#39;s true that their faces are still yellow, but I think it&#39;s special and the printing is good for its age.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Anyway, it was cheap set ready in 1999, I think it&#39;s a good buy even today.&nbsp;It would have been better if the &quot;energy field&quot; or &quot;force field&quot; between the two engines was transparent purple than in the movie, but that should be the least of a problem.&nbsp;I recommend!</p>

<h3>My mode</h3>

<p>I took the vehicle off the tan rack because I had to put it on the shelf, not to play.&nbsp;I preferred to place a 2x2 transparent clear brick underneath.</p>

<p>I put a little detail on the engine, a light gray technic gear. That&#39;s how it looks better.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the ebay seller did not send the yellow propellers, I temporarily replaced it with 1x8 tiles, but it is still not bad.</p>
