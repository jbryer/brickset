THE HOTROD SPEEDER
The best feature of this set, hardly any studs show, but the interiour.... well... lets just say that Obi-Wan and Anikin have to fly a ship without controls or seats!!!

ZAM'S SPEEDER
I love the colours, though they're not movie acurate. The fall off wings get extremely anoying, the same with the windscreen. However, on the plus side you get Zam yes ZAM!!! and she never looked better ( until you reverse the head). 

OVERALL 
Extremely brilliant!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-06T10:46:19Z","wonderful scene in the movie, wonderful set in lego form!","it's the only set that comes with Zam Wesell, and she rocks as a minifig! Ani and Obi are great too, but are common in SW ep2 sets (duh!) they all come with their weapons, but it was kinda disappointing dat Zam doesn't come with an unique long-range projectile rifle, as it's supposed to be. this is just a standard rifle, oh well, it doesn't bother me that much.

the yellow Hotrod Speeder is just perfect, no flaws at all, it's the right shape, colour and size, it has some nice printed parts (love those things) and even comes with a functional storage compartment for the sabers of Ani and Obi :-)

Zam's Airspeeder is great as well, but not perfect. the overall design and shape is okay, but the two prongs at the front are way too broad and the green used for this Speeder is much lighter than it's supposed to be, as its movie-counterpart was just as green as the Thunderbird 2. i love the canopy window and the li'l nice falling-off wings are a decent feature, and the mechanism is well hidden. however, this feature makes the Speeder feel wobbly and weak, not as solid as it's supposed to be.

rating:
the minifigs are perfect, sake for Zam's cheesy standard rifle and receive a 9!
the Hotrod Speeder is pefect and deserves a big 10!
the Aispeeder of Zam is very nice, but not perfect and receives an 8!

since the speeders are the 'main characters' of this set, they count twice and the figs only count once.

so we've got 9, 10, 10, 8 and 8, which is 45 : 5 = 9!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T10:07:55Z","Great Colours!!!!","This set really stands out on my selves of Lego because of its bright colours. I like Anakins speeder because, well the colour and some of the details in it, very well done.
I love Zems speeder it just looks so cool and i like the breaking of wings (even though they do fall of easly) and Zem looks really cool.

              over all Great Job Lego!  (would have gotten a 10 but there isnt any guns on the speeders and that would look cool, and theres no room to put Zems gun any were.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-15T16:54:59Z","Speeders All Around","         Yeah! This is a cool set by far. I like that this set if fairly low-priced and has two aircraft in it. The yellow hotrod speeder is nice and I love the cool engine features. It looks just like a car with jet engines. Its also great that you get the good Anakin head and you get the Obi-Wan too. I really think the Obi-Wan head and hair looks aweful, but you cant supress the facts! Oh Yeah, more light sabers included!! 

Zam Wesells speeder is even better. Having an inclosed cockpit, it looks just like a starfighter. It is mega-realistic and has the cool aerodynamic sloped pieces that make the speeders' arms. Zam is cool, she boasts a good helmet with goggles. She looks good, the part behind her head, the clawdite part, it isnt nearly as scary as the movies one so I give it the go-ahead. Anybody who likes starwars and likes that scene will like this set!!! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T22:25:20Z","Great speeder set!","         This set is in very great detail, and the speeders included are very real and good looking! The good Anakin head is included, along with the odd looking Kenobi head, and yeah, the mysterious Zam Wesell with the cool clawdite reversable head! First things first, da' speeders.
       Good Guys' Hot Rod Speeder ZK-7. 
   This speeder doesnt look very fast at all, but the good engine details make it look like a jet-car! The speeder is yellow and it seats two, but there are no seats that support Annie and Obi. The speeder has cool wind shield pieces and looks very cool, it can also be a very futuristic jet-car if you put it into a lego town. 

 Zam Wesell's Coruscant Speeder CPRJ-80.
    This speeder is sleek and fish-looking. It has excellant aerodynamics so it can slice through the air like a bullet. It has cool &quot;arms&quot; that stabilize it while airborn and two &quot;tails&quot; that moniter position and can steer it. The cockpit shield is awesome and Zam has the best suits. She has a good gogg-helmet, grey garb, and a masked face-and a clawdite side of it. Her speeder is more complex and in reality, most likely could have outrun any other zoomer in the Coruscant sky! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T04:20:21Z","high speed chase ","This set is really cool. The minfigs are wicked and the Zam fig with the double face head is also really cool. The hotrod speeder driven by Anakin has really good engine detail but obi-Wan and Anakin have no chairs and the hotrods controls are not moveable. 

Zams speeder is really cool as well although I don't think alll the colours are right. Also Zam doesn't come with a long-range rifle but with a black gun like the tusken raiders. The highlights on the wind shield is cool and the falling off arms are cool but can get annoying if your fingers slip on them at the wrong time.

"AFOSL","2010-08-07T17:13:54.093Z","Bounty Hunter Pursuit:  A Set of Two Halves.","<p>If you have actually followed my reviews over the past year and a half, you might have come to a small conclusion about me.&nbsp; I really like the 2002 range of Star Wars Lego sets.&nbsp; I probably have a favourite set from each year of the Star Wars line up, not that I could list them right now.&nbsp; That kind of list might take some serious thought and is not the kind of project to knock out in just a few lazy minutes.&nbsp; But I can tell you that 7133 Bounty Hunter Pursuit is not my favourite set of 2002.&nbsp; It's a good set and I like it a lot.&nbsp; In fact, I like it a lot more today than I did when I bought it eight years ago.&nbsp; It's grown on me and I'm more than happy for it to be a part of my collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>The Box and Instructions</b></p>
<p>The box of this set is as attractive as any other from the time period, with the main image partially separated from the rest of the box by a curved silver frame.&nbsp; The main image is of an appropriate Star Wars background - this time being Coruscant - with the fully assembled models composited on top.&nbsp; Because of the size of the box, and with the image, logo's and text, some might say that the overall design feels a little cluttered.&nbsp; Almost every inch of space is used and it certainly has a busy feel to it.One side of the box contains an image of the three minifigures, while the other contains a picture of one figure (Clawdite) and an image of the Jedi's acquired speeder.<br />
<br />
The front cover of the instruction manual contains the same image found on the box, although due to the manual's size, a small portion of the image has been cut off.&nbsp; What's more, the set's name has been imposed on to the image and on top of one of the speeders.&nbsp; Like I've said, some people might find the design to be cluttered, and this will be emphasized by the small manual.Like quite&nbsp; few sets of the era, the back cover of the manual for 7133 has us looking over the shoulder of Yoda, intently looking at his computer screen that is displaying information about Lego's Star Wars products from the previous years.&nbsp; The back cover also has website addresses for starwars.com and Lego.com.&nbsp; Very useful.The last few pages advertise various other Star Wars sets for that season such as, Jango Fett's Slave 1 and Jedi Defence.The construction pages of the manual are based on a gridded pattern over a light blue background, sprinkled with white dots.&nbsp; I guess it's supposed to be a star filled evening sky.&nbsp; It's subtle and attractive, and in no way does it interfere with the construction images.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<b>Minifigures</b></p>
<p>Any Star Wars fan will immediately know which minifigures are included in this set.&nbsp; Of course there is Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.&nbsp; There really isn't much to comment on with these two.&nbsp; Both figures depict the characters as they are in the film.&nbsp; Anakin is now a full size figure, unlike his pint sized Episode 1 incarnation.&nbsp; He has a torso printed with typical, brown Jedi robes and also has a padawan learner's hair braid on the right hand side.The Obi Wan minifigure, also with Jedi robes, but it tan, sports a dark orange long hair piece.&nbsp; Although this hair piece isn't movie accurate, and for some Lego collectors, is associated with female based minifigures, it does show that Lego have paid some attention, as the on screen Kenobi does now have the Jedi mullet instead of the shorter style he once had in Episode 1.&nbsp; It shows that Lego keep up with the changes and might also help any collector differentiate their figures.&nbsp; There is one thing that is a little odd about the Kenobi figure.&nbsp; In the manual, Kenobi is shown with a headset, even though the actual minifigure doesn't have one.&nbsp; It maybe the illustration that is also used in the Jedi Starfighter, as the Obi Wan in that set does wear a headset.&nbsp;The third minifigure in this set is also unique to it. The pilot for one of the speeders is the Clawdite, Zam Wesell. This minifigure is quite special, not only in it's uniqueness, but also because it is among the first Star Wars minifigures to have a reversible head. One side of the head is printed with Zam's human form, complete with purple veil and fluttery eye lashes. The other side is printed with her Clawdite, Changeling form, rendered with grey skin, big eyes, and various other alien features.</p>
<p>The figure's torso and legs are purple and have various accessories, chains and tassels.<br />
Zam is finished off with a grey helmet and a rifle - one of the few Star Wars minifigures to get a proper weapon at the time, instead of the usual megaphone with a coloured stud attached as often seen on battle droids and Stormtroopers.</p>
<p>It's quite a nice minifigure and goes some way to capturing the likeness of the on screen bounty hunter. <br />
<br />
<b>Jedi Speeder</b><br />
<br />
This set contains two speeders, each contained in it's own bag. Bag 1 contains all the parts required to build the heroes' speeder, as well as the minifigures themselves.</p>
<p>Construction is straightforward, starting with the base of the speeder and moving upwards.<br />
Apart from the base of the speeder, which uses black and dark grey, the colour palette of this vehicle is quite vivid. The dark tan almost clashes with the bright yellow, not to mention the lime green which is abundantly used throughout construction. Unlike some of the other new colours introduced by Lego this year, the lime green took me a while to become accustomed to. It also seemed to be the colour that permeated to almost every Star Wars set released in 2002, making it very noticeable when compared to other new colours like dark red and sand green.</p>
<p>The speeder has some nice elements used in it's construction. Plenty of smooth slopes and wedges give the craft a streamlined look and the use of a few Technic based elements help overcome some logistical building issues such as bricks mounted sideways.</p>
<p>Some of the elements are printed, such as the engine blocks, and the head lamps are created from chrome plated minifigure cups, each held in place with a 1x1 plate with clip.</p>
<p>The craft contains enough room for both minifigures to sit side by side, with the left side containing a control panel and some sort of steering element.</p>
<p>The finished speeder is a good representation of the actual craft, and the use of many smooth elements and tiles help it achieve a very polished and streamlined look, as there are hardly any studs on show.<br />
<br />
<b>Zam Wesell's Speeder</b><br />
<br />
Unlike the previous speeder, Zam's is a little more technical and the build is both lengthier and more involving, as it has moving parts.</p>
<p>The speeder is a weird design with a cockpit sandwiched between two long, forward pointing mandibles. With a twin tail at the rear, this places the cockpit firmly in the centre of the craft. Construction starts here. The cockpit contains at least a dozen small Technic parts, from pins to axles, to bricks with holes in them, and even a click hinge that holds the cockpit canopy in place.<br />
The canopy is moulded in transparent black, which is a bit of a shame as it is also has printing. When colours are printed on to this smoky base they do not print true, therefore tend to be much darker than the actual colours they're supposed to be. It's sad to say that the orange and green stripes printed on the canopy do not match the orange and green bricks they are based on.<br />
The canopy's mounting isn't perfect so it wobbles a bit and can fall forward when the speeder is given a good swoosh.</p>
<p>The internals of the cockpit contain a small control panel for Zam to navigate with, but no joystick or other control devices.</p>
<p>Behind the cockpit are the workings of the craft where most of the Technic elements are contained. The elements themselves help form the base of the rear of the cockpit which uses a sliding operation (back and forth) and are attached to the main cockpit with rubber bands. Unfortunately with time, these rubber bands perish so the back and forth action will not work forever unless you have a ready supply of bands. Perished and snapped rubber bands was a common problem with any kit that relied on them. Nowadays Lego seem to be using a silicon based band that is more resistant to the ravages of time and should last much longer than any natural rubber band.</p>
<p>The rest of the cockpit, or central part of the craft is built up using a lot of bright green slopes, lime green bricks and some bright orange tiles. Most of the inner workings and sliding elements are now contained within the ship and mostly hidden from sight. If constructed properly, the sliding action should be smooth, and the rubber bands should pull the sliders back in to their original positions.</p>
<p>Construction moves on to the front mandibles. Once again a lot of bright and gaudy colours are used including large, lime green 12x3 double wedges which are fully printed with orange, bright green and silver markings. The printing in this set is mostly excellent, and it's hard to see why Lego have stopped printing pieces in favour of sticker production in today's kits.<br />
Once both mandibles are made, they are then mated up to the centre of the craft, but are not fixed in place by normal means. Instead they are held by a pin mounted on the sliders built earlier. Move the sliders back and put the mandibles in place. Release the sliders, and they move forward, locking the mandibles in position. When the sliders are moved back again, the mandibles fall off the craft. It's a bit of a wobbly play feature which allows a simulation of Zam Wesell's crash landing, even though the mandibles never fell from the speeder in the film. <br />
The design isn't perfect, and since each mandible is only held in place by one little pin, you cannot turn the speeder upside down as both mandibles will just fall off.<br />
<br />
<b>Final Thoughts</b><br />
<br />
This set has really grown on me. It has it's good points and it's bad points too, but overall is a nice set to own. It has some unique printed pieces and a colour scheme that is unlike anything else in the Star Wars range of Lego toys. Looking around my collection, Bounty Hunter Pursuit stands out quite prominently amid a sea of grey and brown. Very few other Lego Star Wars sets can claim such a vivid, and initially sickening, colour palette. It almost beggars belief that such colours were used in the movie, but being a night time scene I guess the colours are not quite so vibrant as a plastic model in daylight.</p>
<p>Whilst Anakin's speeder is solid and a very nice piece in my opinion, Zam Wesell's speeder is let down by being somewhat wobbly with poorly fitting elements. This is mostly down to the sliding mechanism, and also the way the canopy is attached to the cockpit, which causes it to occasionally fall open.</p>
<p>And although it's nice to have so many printed pieces in one set, the printing on Zam's speeder's canopy doesn't match the colours used in the model and it really shows.</p>
<p>But the Zam Wesell minifigure should help towards filling in the set's minor shortcomings. She might not be as sought after as Jango Fett or Greedo, but she is another one in a ever growing list of unique minifigures produced by Lego. And there is no telling if Lego will ever produce another girl like Zam.<br />

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-01T13:10:31.03Z","I Hate When He Does That.","<p>Set #7133 Bounty Hunter Pursuit: Based on the opening action scene from Episode II Bounty Hunter Pursuit is a set worth tracking down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this set you get to build two speeders, the one Anakin 'borrowed' from some unfortuante person and Zam's speeder. Both of them look different from one another and are quite ingenious. As a bonus they make for an interesting display piece for your Episode II collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anakin's speeder is built primarily with yellow and a dull looking orangish toned color. There is a storage compartment in the back that can hold both lightsabers, though the hatch won't close completely if you stick them in there with their blades attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zam's speeder is built up with mostly green pieces in various shades, with orange thrown in to the mix and a bit of yellow to draw your eye. The speeder is sleek and fast looking, and on top of that it includes a fall-apart gimmick. Slide back the two top mounted transparent pieces and the wings will fall off for crashing in the bowels of Coruscant action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three Mini-Figures are included with this set, Episode II Anakin, Obi-Wan and the rare Zam Wessel. We haven't seen her yet in any new sets, it would be nice to get her in the pink toned coloring, but for now I'm happy with her as she is. Accessory wise you get both Jedi's Lightsabers and a black musket to represent Zam's fancy looking weapon. (It is much larger than the&nbsp;blaster she actually used while defending herself in the movie though.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say once again that I strongly recommend this set to anyone collecting the LEGO Star Wars theme. Not only are the speeders eye catchingly bright, but this is the only set LEGO has offered so far with the character of Zam Wessel. If you can get a good deal on this snatch it up right quick.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
