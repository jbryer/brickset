"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-02T05:20:37Z","A nice set for a neglected Star Wars vehicle","This, along with the B-wing, are the most under-rated ships of the Rebel fleet. If you have read some of the comments below, the A-Wing was important in the ROTJ, although it was only briefly shown.

A nice little set that comes with a pilot and a mechanic. The vehicle itself is solid and highly playable (the windshield and the hatch in the back open up). Although the overall look is a little on the bland side, this is made up with the high playablility and &quot;swoosh&quot; value of this set. Considering it has 123 pcs and was sold for only US$14.99 (although selling for a lot more now), this set was a great value and should be in everyone's collection!

"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-08T00:28:24Z","Highly satisfying set","A cool set, nice a solid. The colors are good and details are fine. Comes with an A-Wing pilot and a mechanic minifig. A good representation of the A-Wing considering it's one of the early releases. Now all I need is the Y-Wing to complete my rebel fleet!!

I agree with mofiman, considering the price, this is a good value and it's a fun little set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This little set, along with the Shuttle were the two &quot;must haves&quot; among the out-of-production sets so I was really happy when I finally managed to get my hands on one.

It's not an incredibly detailed model and the nose structure isn't quite there, but it is damn cool.  The construction is sturdy (probably one of the most sturdy of the minifig scale models) and it looks like what it's supposed to.  I wasn't fussed about the mechanic, but the A-wing pilot is a great figure to have.

I love the set, but I can't possibly give it more than a 7 due to the relative nature of the marks.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-17T04:31:40Z","cockpit","Cool set, but the nose at front is a little ugl and I still haven't warmed to the particular shade of red. Also, does everyone else have the problem that in order for the hatch to come down, the pilot has to sit back and can't sit upright?
the compartment with the box for the mechanic's gear is prett cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-05T20:00:26Z","SMALL, SLEEK AND SUPER","I love this set. The rebel A-Wing is barely seen in the movie and is one of the under-rated vechiles, as it is only featured in ROTJ for a short while. I forgot to mension in another thread (snowspeeder) about who much I like the A-Wing as a small ship. It has the storage compartment, the cockpit and the A-Wing pilot along with a maitanence rebel. I love this set and I reakon it has no downsides. This set is also nicely worked for a under-featured set.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:17:25Z","Fastest Fighter In the Rebel Armada","      This ship isnt very sleek, althgough is should be, it is hard for lego to design an ultra sleek model without using big molded pieces!  It has a nice array of heavy laser cannons on the side hardpoints and the minifig pilot is quit nice! You also get a rebel mechanic and tool box! The reddish color scheme is mighty nice and it uses some nice pieces and a cool back part! The A-wing isnt shown much but it is the hero in Ep6 when Lt.Jredda crashes headfirst into the Super Star Destroyer's bridge! This is an inspiring model that is hard to find nowadays!

The A-wing is very detailed from top to bottom. I like the cockpit and the little box for storage. This set is really awesome and should be owned by any Lego Star Wars fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-11T20:07:26.857Z","quite &quot;blocky&quot;","this set is nothing to me compared to the new, sleek a-wing. this set is lumpy and doesnt look like it should, i know the tipe of blocks in 200 were limited but still, im not happy with it. now the good things about it are the storage compartment behind the guy, the engines are pretty cool and i realy like the guns, even though theyre incredably basic.

overall, i injoyed this set for a while but now its doomed to an eternity of spare parts",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"lego_here","2009-09-13T08:36:04.81Z","great for being old","This set is simply the best before lego star wars started making special pieces.I love this set so much ,its small,nimble and great for any type of collection.Its also the oldest set I have ,even though I dont have the box (because i got it off ebay) its still in my top 10 favorites .

pros
2 figures
cheap at the time
storage box that can go inside(and if you have a crane you can load it on with that!!)
clear cockpit
printed bricks
tools like a spanner and binocles

cons
yellow people though it wasnt until 2005 when they changed it to cream
bit blocky


If you find this set either on ebay,sale or in your attic make sure you get it as its great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
