"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-23T17:36:52Z","Nice, cheap set, with good pieces potential.","I find that it's a great set. I modified the speeder bike a little, and switched a few pieces around in a few places, but overall, I like this set how it is. It's alot of fun having the scout trooper fall off his doomed bike, thinking he is going to survive, when he is covered with rocks the size of his head. (To do so, you need to pull some extra rock pieces out of your collection.) It's also interesting to think of new ways for the two Ewoks, Wicket and Paploo, to beat up the storm trooper. Try using those 1x1 bricks with vertical handles. The glider has fishing rods to heep the wings straight, not lances. I got mine on sale for 5 USD (originally 13 USD), from S@H. They should have ewoks in a minifig pack. Two ewoks and an endor Leia, that's what they should have. The ewoks are also good as creatures for your medieval realm, the wings on the glider make good sails, the fishing rods are useful for well, being fishing rods, and the stormie, give him a normal helmet with visor and call him a futuristic soldier.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-03T18:24:14Z","it's a nice set, with nice figs","i'm so happy i found this set, hidden behind many MANY other Lego sets that don't catch my interest. Sure, for 14 euros (16,97 dollars) it was a bit overprized for an older set. but i picked it up anyway, since i'm a starwars fan, and a lego fan.

this set is great mainly because of the minifigs.
there's this way cool biker scout, with a great helmet piece and nice detail on the torso, he comes with a megaphone-blaster thingie. there's a stormie, my first stormie and he's cute! :P he also gets a megaphone blaster.
then you've got two ewoks, named wicket and paploo, which is a bit perplexing, since wicket never used a hangglider in the movie and paploo didn't operate the catapult.
this is another example of lego's fear of including generic nameless characters, instead of two generic ewoks, we get two main character ewoks. but who cares, i'm calling them 'generic hangglider ewok' and 'generic catapult handler/archer ewok' anyway :D wicket comes with a small stone to throw from his catapult (though i still haven't found any mechanism on the hangglider to drop it) and paploo comes with his bow and two large rocks to launch from the catapult.
they're nicely detailed with a chewbacca-like clamshell piece to cover up the belly as well, and they've got shorter legs to make them look shorter (why didn't lego make longer legs for chewie then?) but the clamshell pieces are, just like chewie's and the gammorean's pieces, single-coloured, which detracts from the overall detail...

the speeder bike is just plain awesome and a definite improvement over the old model (which i don't have, but i've compared pics) it looks wicked fast and seems accurate enough for a system set.
the ewok catapult is a bit simplistic, but a good prop anyway, it's got some nice bits of foliage and there are these rotating 'steering wheel' type of handles to 'lower the catapult'. they don't actually work, they're not supposed to work, but they can rotate and are a nice addition of detail to the otherwise very plain catapult, with its junior throw piece.
the ewok hangglider features some nice 'sails' and the fishing rods holding it all together make for a great custom diorama you can make out of this set: make up a story in which wicet goes out there to catch a fish, and then hooks a stormie
the hangglider's overall construction feels a bit bulky and oversised and the ewok hangs from it in an inaccurate way. he sort of graps hold of the robotic arms hanging from the glider, instead of having a long bar against his belly as their movie counterparts have. the hangglider is quite flimsy as well, especially the fishing rods have a tendency of falling out pretty easily. there'll be not much ewok-swooshing around for this guy :(, but i can always put the furry li'l guys in a twinpod cloudcar.

rating:

the imperial minifigs both receive a big 10!
the ewoks, with their single-coloured clamshell pieces, both get one point less, 9
the bike gets a big 10 as well!
the catapult is somewhat simplistic, but works fine and gets a 7
the hangglider is too flimsy to work properly, though it looks fine, it gets a 6

the figs count one time, the vehicles/props/scenery count twice

10 + 10 + 9 + 9 = 38
10 + 7 + 6 = 23
10 + 7 + 6 = 23

38 + 23 + 23 = 84 : 10 = 8,4
this set gets an 8

The scout trooper has the cool speeder bike that has been upgraded for the better from the old ones.  The stormy has the traditional &quot;loudhailer&quot; version of the Blastech E-11 blaster rifle. Any set with Imperial's in it is an instant go-ahead! The Ewoks are stupid, you cant even see their faces because they are the same color as their hoods and vests, but otherwise, they shouldnt have dared to attack the Imperial's and in reality, the stormtrooper would have smoked them. The Ewoks have a catapult that hurls stones, and a crude glider that carries an Ewok overhead! Combine with the SPEEDER BIKES set and with the AT-ST to make the Battle of Endor.

The remade speeder bike is cool but it would have been good if lego included another speederbike. The Ewoks are wicked and it is a nice addition to get the stormy as well.

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-03-02T20:37:34.293Z","Not All That Bad","Quite a unique and now rather rare gem of a Lego set; this set is the only way to obtain Ewok minifigures. It also features three other “Battle of Endor” components, the most outstanding of which is the Ewok Glider which even comes with a display stand. I, for one, am proud to own it but regretful for dismantling it.

As I mentioned earlier, the “minifig reason” to get this are the two ewoks Paploo (with the tan torso) and chief Wicket in brown, both with the short, unbending legs utilized to portray Yoda and young Boba Fett, amongst others. The other two minifigs are special as well, a scout trooper and a stormtrooper. The Scout Trooper uses a visored minifig head instead of the usual solid black. This is a sufficient number of minifigs, but I was wishing that an Endor-costumed Leia or a rebel soldier would be thrown in as well.

There are three main components here: the Ewok catapult, a scout trooper speeder bike and the afore-mentioned glider. I’ll cover them in this order, so here we go.

The catapult comes with two 2 by 2 “drum” pieces for ammunition. Sorry to disappoint, but there’s not fancy elastic release or whatever as seen in the film, so you simply push down on the other end to launch. It serves its purpose anyway and, well, doesn’t look too shoddy either. It’s an easy build and quite easy to put together too.

Most fans who were with the line from the beginning probably remember that old  “Speeder Bikes” set from 1999. This set, Ewok Attack, may well be Lego’s first effort at doing redesigns of not-so-perfect sets. In fact, my opinion is that they did a mighty good job and this speeder bike ranks in as one of my favourite little Lego models. Simpler but altogether more sure of itself in design and structure, this model is actually very movie accurate. The most notable improvement is the sloping pieces at the front of. I was a bit puzzled when I saw the half-pyramid triangular piece on the earlier rendition. This design was so successful that it was reused – exactly the same design, though with different colouration – for the 2003 AT-TE and AT-AT sets.

The glider is the most complicated bit of this Lego set. Intricately detailed, the presence of quite a number of technic pieces makes it pretty impressive. To release the 1 by 1 cylindrical ammo, though, you simply tilt the model backwards. It can only hold one at a time, but that’s understandable. The translucent wings printed with fancy designs are unique to the set. I also like the display stand that you assemble out of transparent parts. The craft is allowed to turn and swivel upon the stand, thanks to a ball-and-socket technic joint.

“Ewok Attack” is a great set to get if you’re a huge Episode VI fan as I am, and also works as a wonderful beginner set. If you are a hardcore UCS builder this might be way too easy a set to build, but it’s fine by me.

"Gus_263","2008-04-15T14:40:53.11Z","Ewok Attack","This set was released in 2002, is another Star Wars set of the classic subtheme. This is a scene of the episode six, when the Ewok were attacking the imperial soldiers in the Endor planet. This set is small, but is well made and have also a nice design combined with color schemes like the brown, beige, some black details and white on the bike scouter and imperial trooper. Two ewoks are included, these are brown, with the little legs, and these are covered by a piece with some details of the Ewoks, and altough this piece have only one color (one have the beige and other the brown color on these pieces), it is good detailed. The bike scouter of the empire, included in this set, is too nice designed, like the imperial trooper (the both are the same, except by the different head) with details on the armor and well made head (the helmet is the head on the scouter and in the trooper, but each helmet have the differences), another Star Wars character well made in Lego style. Some itens like the longbow, used with the Ewok, and the trooper's weapon are included and makesthis set better, altough the weapon features an old style. The catapult included, one used by Ewoks, is too cool, and with a color scheme basically made by the brown color, but with some black details. The catapult's base is simple, with some blocks increasing the side, it still in a good weight, and the catapult launchs well the small blocks. Another Ewok's weapon is the system with the wings, that can carry an Ewok minifigure on it very well. The wings are large, and with the same material of some of the flags used on the sets from the pirates theme, and also on some wings of the ninja subtheme. It still good on the base, due to some sticks on the sides. The Ewok stay on the front of the wings, connected by the hands and some blocks on the back. The imperial bike scouter stay on a bike speeder, well made and with some notable characteristics of the other version of this speeder, released previously. Too with much brown, this speeder still well made, the base have a good size and is good to put the minifigure, above it, and it can reach the directions. The back is increased by some other blocks with different shapes, to it looks like the original of the movie. Under the base, there are two small pieces, each like  a ski, to make the speeder still in feet. The front is too in a good position, and it is made basically by two sticks on each side, and there are on the front, two triangular plates with brown color, like in the movie. This is another well made Star Wars sets, that includes useful pieces, combine these well in a nice builted small set, and it is too cool to play with, and increase other sets.

The hang glider is great but it can be a pain for young kids. It can easily be bent out of shape and fall apart. It looks great as a display item though. There is also a back lego piece on the hang glider tha can hold a rock (for the ewok to throw down). The catapult is done very well. I like how it has leaves sticking out from its base.

<p>Building this set is extremely fun, even with the small amount of parts, and you get what you pay for. A $12.99 set, Ewok Attack really delivers a diverse amount of good pieces to use in creating your own Endor battle, and with so many unique pieces, like the catapult, printed wings, and other parts, you really get the maximum for your money. The 4 minifigs contribute to value, and because you have a catapult, glider, speeder bike, AND 4 minifigures, playability is actually pretty good. Not to mention you could only get Ewoks in this set for about 7 years, until their redesign. For 2 Ewoks and 2 Imperials, this is sort of an old-school battle pack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction wise the build is fairly simple for all of the models included with this set, you get to make an Imperial Speeder Bike, a large Ewok Catapult and the Ewok Glider. Each object has easy to follow instructions and enhances any LEGO Star Wars Endor display. More Speeder Bikes are always a bonus. As are more Scout Troopers and Ewoks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike The Battle of Endor these Ewok Mini-Figures don't have painted eyes, so they can be anyone you want them to be. Accesories include two older style Space themed blasters, projectiles for the catapult and the glider (really just round bricks/round you know I'm not sure what those pieces are called. But they're really quite common.) as well as the coveted black archer's bow &amp; arrow. Which I believe is a very unique and sought after accessory for some, though I could be wrong about the sought after part, I don't really follow what's hot in the pieces department too much.</p>

Plus Scout and Stormtroopers aren't as easy to come by as you might expect. Recommended for all LEGO Star Wars fans and especially Ewok fans.

"Chills","2012-09-08T22:18:48.363Z","Pretty cool set, even after 10 years","<p>This is the most recent Endor purchase to find its way into my collection. I picked up all the newer sets first, then backtracked and grabbed this one on eBay for a decent price. All the pieces were there, all clean, and a good copy of the instructions was included. Even though this set is now 10 years old I really dig its old-school LEGO style.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Compared to the new Ewok Attack 7956 this set seems quite dated. Even so it takes place in an iconic scene from ROTJ. Ewok catapult, Ewok hang-glider, speeder bike, and two Imperials... they all take you right back to that epic battle where the Rebels are desperately trying to fight off the Imperials.</li><li>Pro 2: It was a straight-forward build, not much to any of the models. I will say that I like the old-school type of speeder-bike. I think LEGO should get away from the single piece used for the entire back half of the new bikes. However, I do like the new hang-glider that comes with 8038 a little more than the one in this set. But it is cool to have 2 different ones in my collection.</li><li>Pro 3: A small set and you get 4 mini figures. The stormtrooper and biker scout are not too unique but pretty cool nonetheless; the Ewoks... well they are unique but...(read 1st con)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The Ewoks, wow LEGO really dropped the ball here. The head pieces are from the same mold and just different colors. And they are solid colors, too! No detail on them at all. The Ewoks from the newer sets are much better.</li></ul>
<p>I grabbed this set for $15, which is a pretty good deal. If you're building an Endor collection then this old-school set is a must have. The details aren't as polished as the newer sets but that's where this set gets it charm. It has good playability, a good build, and unique minifigures to add to your collection.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4

I love the 1st edition imperial troopers and getting them in a small set is great. The Ewok figures, despite not having any printing are exclusive and I like them.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The builds are great, the Ewok glider is unique with its film like wings and has a neat transparent handle to swoosh around from. The catapult is lame, but I don&#39;t know what they really could&#39;ve done to make it interesting. The speeder bike is the highlight IMO, it is my favourite design to date, and it very swoosh-able.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall 9/10 set, and I am glad you can buy it pretty&nbsp;cheap sealed.</p>
