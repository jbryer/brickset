"A_Brickset_user","2000-09-03T00:00:00Z","","WOW! This lego looks so much like the real thing. The wings move from both flight (closed) to attack position (open). There is a cool littel spot in the back for R2-D2, who just happens to be included in this set. You also get yet another Luke figure, but this time he's wearing his orange flight suit. He still comes with a lightsaber though! This set is so cool you almost forget it comes with a maintenance guy with some tools and some repair sled or something. Every Star Wars fan must have one of these!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2001-09-01T00:00:00Z","","This is an absolutely incredible kit!  Near perfect.  Good assortment of mini-figs and a very solidly-designed ship.  My only complaints are that R2D2s compartment doesn't encompass him, ie. the ship should be wider in the rear so that his compartment is completely enclosed, and that they didn't include Wedge with the kit.  I know Wedge wasn't in that scene of the movie, but how else are we ever going to get a Wedge figure?  Either they'll make a ""Victory Celebration at the Ewok Village"" set and include a Wedge mini-fig in it or they'll include his figure in another Mini-fig 3-pack.  Nevertheless, the quality of this kit can earn it no lower than a 10.  Well done, TLG!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2002-05-16T00:00:00Z","","It's been a while since I've reviewed an sets here, but I've got 
quite a lot of interest about this set. Not only being star wars
gives it a good rating, but among other features, there is quite
a lot of impressive detail about it, and that is what crosses the line
between what I call a ""wannabe set"" and a ""solid model"". The X Wing
Fighter is yet another example of a solid model, with an excellent parts
to cash ratio, lots of rare and useful parts, as well as a large portion
of basic bricks. Although a lot of specialized parts abound the model, 
the awesome design, minigigure accuracy, and the all around great model 
more than make up for compromise, no wonder this set getting high prices on
ebay, quite similar to per se, the snowspeeder model. Alternate models for
this set are nearly limitless, and do quite well compared to other current
star wars models, some of them almost self deserving for the honor of 
a star wars model. My overall opinion on this set? It's a great all around model,
so if you see one at a decent price, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, get
your hands on a snow speeder, but avoid the new 2002 stuff. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My favorite Star Wars set so far! This set is a good value and can stand alone. If this was the only set you owned, it has enough pieces to keep you busy and produce many other cool creations. The main X-Wing model itself is straight forward and looks great. The scale is slightly small, but still allows for detail. Many LEGO fans dig the new locking hinges that finally keep those wings in place!

That said, it's a solidly built model, it looks like an X-wing and it has 4 minifigs in a low-middle price-range kit.  It also looks good next to the Y-Wing (whereas the new X-Wing - 4502 - looks too big).

The way wings open is nothing special, I don't see any wrong angle in it...still I'll be able to compare this set with the new x-wing in a few days.

Only thing I complain about is the landing system. The kind of arch under it is weird to me. Also the fact that you can't hide the front undercarriage sucks. i believe you are able to hide it in the knew set.

COMPARE!!!!!!!!!!
This set is a WONDERFUL set and i think that every Star Wars collector should have it. It comes with four figures with Luke AND Biggs. I like this because LEGO has a tendency of putting main characters with all of the sets which I HATE!!!! Like WHY in the world does chewie have to come with the AT-ST! it should come with imperials!
This set has great playability and goes right in with the theme. I suggest getting more than one (I wish I did).
Well, being a set it is good, but were in the world do you people get the idea that this is wayyy better than the new x-wing??? the new one has its flaws but is MUCH more movie accurete(besides the white).

I love X-wings and the fast that lego has made a model for the x-wing, i am deliberately happy. This set has some good details but it is a bit unrealistic. The wings are to short, the nose is probably just right, but the control panel inside lukes cockpit is trash! Say, what if he flies it not around the death star, he would crash and die, right? The laser cannons are always cool and the engines: Neato! The start reason I got this is because it looks like a jet fighter, and so it is!The thing to make the wings move into attack position is a little weak but it manages. I would say that lego needs to make a bigger, more realistic in color version of this one and i would be all set. Luckily, my wish was granted! WOOO-HOO! The 5402 X-WING + YODAS HUT!

The X-Wing is perhaps one of the most iconic ships of the Star Wars universe, and I'd even gone so far as to build my own version of one in the mid 90s, before Lego started their own line.  Like the newer versions, and unlike this one, I had attempted to have the wings open by some sort of mechanism in my own version: with this release, Lego took the different route of having each wing open independently.  Think this was the first set that I ever saw those toothed bricks used to keep them open!

Would give the set a solid five except I'm not too sure about the length of the wings on this set: think they are maybe a mite stubby.  Also wasn't too sure about the undercarriage on the model: there's nowhere to store the back legs or front landing skid when in flight mode.

Done up in the right colors (I hate the colors for version 2), with no stickers, a ground crew and shuttle, and Luke with a lightsaber.  No fancy compartments, no attempt to be fancy, just a good serviceable ship.  If anything falls off, it is not a mystery where the piece goes.  Sure, it can break, but you practically have to fly it into a wall in order to break off multiple pieces.  A little ground shuttle included has a mechanic as well.

The set is really nice to put together and it has some great play features. It comes with 4 minifigs: Luke Skywalker (who also comes with a lightsaber), Biggs Darklighter (the only set with Darklighter so far), an engineer and a very basic R2-D2.<br><br>I like the gray color which LEGO used in this set and how the fins can be sviweld in attack mode. When I've seen video reviews on YouTube I noticed that the newer x-wings have a gear which you can use to move the fins but this version does not. The engines on the back are very nice and you get some two cargo areas. One of them is on the front and the other one is on the back where you can store Luke's lightsaber. I would recommend you not to put anything in the cargo area on the front because it'll be hard to get the lightsaber out of there. The cockpit opens very nicely and on the back is a place to store R2-D2. This set also includes a cargo speeder which has some tools to repair this x-wing before and after the battle.

It had odd color highlights such as the beige on the hood, and the wings didn't lock in quite the correct angle to satisfy. The fuselage was also a bit bulky, which set the ship off a bit. And overall, there were strange little bits that just seemed out of place. To add to the problem, the landing gear was detachable rather than retractable, and that oddly hurt the image of the fighter. Even the cute little mechanic cart seemed only half accurate, though it remains the only maintenance cart of quality made by LEGO for&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>.

But the LEGO x-wing still has never quite captured the feel of a ""real"" x-wing from the films. The proportions are just off slightly. With the limited resources available to LEGO at the time, they did an amazing attempt at the model. Pre-printed canopy, number stripes, and nose all create a feeling of theme. The large engines definitely feel right, even if they also feel slightly underdone. The inclusion of accessories, while poorly implemented, is always preferred to nothing at all. And although the landing gear does not retract, it does still look nice when the ship is grounded.</span><br style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ""><br style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: white; line-height: 20px; ""><b style=""font-family: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.4; background-color: white; "">Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b><span style=""font-family: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.4; background-color: white; "">In 1999, I'm not sure if there is much LEGO could really do to correct the set's problems. The landing gear could certainly have been retractable, there is no doubt about that. The beiges should have been gone, though I think the grey is a better choice than white. The wing-locks, I feel, are half out of step and should have been corrected in development so that the wings lock in the correct positions. Lastly, a little more streamlining would have been nice, especially around the oversized hull. Possibly extending the nose out another two studs may have fixed some of the perspective problems.</span><br style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ""><span style=""font-family: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.4; background-color: white; ""><br></span><font face=""inherit""><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ""></span></font><span style=""font-family: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.4; background-color: white; ""><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;</b>The minifigures with this set are somewhat unique. Luke Skywalker first appeared in his pilot outfit with this set, but this specific Luke would later become one of the most heavily duplicated figures in the franchise. His helmet's prints are extremely well-done and the flight suit is so appropriate that it has hardly changed in fourteen years. His face is simple, but so were most of the 1999 faces. Biggs Darklighter remains unique to this set after over a decade. His face is an extremely simple design—basically that of a French waiter—but his helmet is to die for and is one of the best detailed of the entire series. The third man, a generic worker, has a unique outfit with a rare beige hat.

In lieu of making a new x-wing, LEGO re-released this model in 2002 with new packaging. 2004 saw the precursor to the current model of x-wing. Many of the early errors were corrected, such as the landing gear and the streamlined nature of the craft, but other mistakes were made such as the expanded use of unnecessary colors, the change from grey to white for the hull, and the addition of bulbousness to the craft. The addition of a gear to open and close the wings corrected the problem caused by the lock-hinges. Two years later, a similar version was released, but the misplaced colors had largely been removed. The bulbous nature remained. The fourth and final model of the craft, from 2012, removed virtually all of the misplaced colors and smoothed out most of the bulbs, while also adding a general stream-lined look to the set. Little details all around the set now give it a much more authentic look that the earliest version lacked. The 2006 version included a Wedge Antilles figure, while the 2012 x-wing included Jek Porkins, continuing a tradition begun with Biggs.

"Hamish100","2010-01-02T16:48:08.983Z","My first review! ","When I first found a picture of this set on Brickplumber's hoth base, (You should see it, it's fantastic) I thought it looked awsome. Three months later, I have the very same set sitting on my desk. It's proably my favorite star wars set so far, much better then any clone wars junk with out rageous price tags

1) The ship
I like the fact that it is very simple to build but also very strong and robust, using roof bricks for the nose. However, on my copy it was almost impsosible to move the wings into the attack formation, so I don't think I'll bother in the future. Some people have complained that the colour is wrong, but this was lego's first attempt at making an x-wing, and I can always rember them being grey. The other good things about it are the great storage compartmants. They are handy for carrying around other items like guns or tools

2) The figures 
We get three figures in this set, and one R2-D2. They are pretty cool, and each one has a diffrent facial expression which is good, and yellow skin (Which in my view is much better than the standard pink). Biggs Darklighter was always my favorite pilot, and so I am glad that lego put him in the set. Luke is pretty average (You can find him in most sets with the very same face, and uniform). Finally, the rebel mechaninc. He has a nice uniform, but unfortantly lego always change the design and colour so it's hard to get more than one of the same type.

3) The accessories
The main thing here is the train, or mechanic speeder. It is quite a simple build, and reminds me of the old blacktron sets. It is pretty easy, so I let my seven year old brother build it (And then break it when he got bored). It has a seating area for the pilots, a driving space for the mechaninc and a fuel area at the rear, where the tools are also stored. Tool wise, we gut a good choice of things to repair stuff with. 

And so to sum up, if you can find one of these-boxed or unboxed-that looks about complete for around £20-£35 than I'd recomend buying one.(I'm still trying to convince my mum that one isn't enough. I could only find a few problems with mine-one being we don't get a red three number for Biggs Darklighter, but you can easily make one. 
For me, this set has fufilled it's purpose-make people happy with hours of fun, and it looks great as a stand alone. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-26T09:50:42Z","X-Wing flies past little speeder thingy on the ground...And Biggs...","This set will show people that LEGO was NOT terrible back before 2005! This is the first Star Wars set released. The set includes Luke Skywalker, Biggs Darklighter or whatever his name is, and a mechanic. Biggs is good so that you can switch from Luke to Biggs. Because this set is no longer available, prices for it will be high. DON'T BE FOOLED! P+C=Pros and Cons:

Pros:

1. Wings come out

2. Back trunk for lightsaber

3. Small speeder transport thingy is awesome!

4. R2-D2 stays in the ship (Doesn't pop out)

5. Front trunk (What the heck is that for?)

Cons:

1. Guns and wings break sometimes

2. Hose at the back will pop off alot, then hard to put back on

All in all, an easy build, just hard to put the wings on (And that pusky hose in the back of the speeder). But it is worth it when this set is done! 4.5/5!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2013-12-23T05:21:31.253Z","Don't own, but have scratchbuilt to the instructions, and I find it quite good.","I was enamored of this set back when I first saw it in the catalog section of LEGO Maniac Magazine. I have craved it since then. I looked longingly at photos of it online, and at last (and belatedly) I looked up the instructions, so that I could follow them as closely as possible with the pieces I have and thus produce an approximation that would let me fully evaluate the design. And aside from color selection in some cases, my collection had everything needed.<br><br>The S-foils are mounted on vertical ratchet hinges, ensuring they stay fixed in place no matter which configuration they're in. The available adjustment of angles is not as fine as with other methods, but the engines make it too much of a task for even the black Technic pins (The angle used for attack position looks exactly right to my eyes anyway, and I've rewatched the battles of Yavin and Endor a great many times). There are some nice printed tiles on marking this for the attentive as Red Five's X-wing, a nice touch. The cannons look good, though they could have stood having 1x1 round bricks plugged into their backs to complete the look. The flashback suppressors in the movies aren't dish-shaped, but it's the closest as could be gotten at this scale. I've heard people complain of the engine tails being easily knocked out; I haven't personally experienced this, but I would ask them to check and make sure they connected the round 2x2 plate to the engine before connecting the round 2x2 bricks. The round bricks seem to not join as firmly to the engine as regular bricks of that size. If you've got the round plate where it should be and it still happens, try inserting a regular 2x2 plate.<br><br>I have heard some describe the main body as oversize, and that frankly leaves me scratching my head. I have looked at the area on this LEGO model, and on the actual film model, many times and from many angles. If anything, it's just a tiny hair on the small side. R2-D2's socket has no sides, but this is honestly very well disguised by the engines. Despite the photos I'd looked at I was unaware of it being sideless until I looked at the instructions. The cockpit piece is one of the few brand-new ones in this set, and looks the part perfectly. It is on ratchet hinges, keeping it tightly closed in flight. The lid to the rear cargo compartment is on a friction hinge, but that poses no problem when swooshing the ship around; the stern is the model's ideal grip point so your fingers make sure it stays shut.<br><br>The fuselage is very well done, and has another compartment in it for storing Luke's saber. And I think the use of roof bricks and inverted roof bricks does a better job showing the fuselage's shape than the hinge method employed by the newer X-wing sets. There is one visual fault her though: In the movies, the nosecone is noticeably just a bit fatter than the rest of the fuselage, but here it's flush with it. The addition of two 1x4 plates and two of those grey 3x4 angled plates to make it stick out more would have been nice.<br><br>The landing gear must be detached for flight, but there's honestly no way to do vertically-retracting landing gear on a System set. There just isn't. The later X-wing set's swing leg and giant non-canon underside landing fins aren't really any better, and in fact they look even less like the landing legs in the movie. The UCS version had accurate landing legs, but the UCS version is a giant set with a giant price-tag. <br><br>The colors are good. The tan honestly isn't that obtrusive (I actually think it creates a subtle optical color illusion to help things blend), and unlike all subsequent sets, this set remembers the little tiny fact that X-WINGS ARE GREY! Not white, GREY! It's a pale grey, but it's still grey! The Millennium Falcon is the same grey, but it hasn't been converted to white bricks, so why has this stupidity been done to the X-Wing? ARRRRGH! ...ahem. Sorry about that.<br><br>We get some nice mini-figures here. Luke with his pre-ROTJ face, his Rebel flightsuit, and his father's second lightsabre. Biggs Darklighter with a stock face but his own unique helmet print. A Rebel mechanic, with a re-used Pirates faceprint and beige coveralls. And of course, R2-D2. There's also a pilot carrier/maintenance mini-tram. A useful vehicle for one's personal Rebel Alliance base, and Luke and co. did ride one briefly in the movie, so it's nice to have that. A shame there's no port on the X-Wing to connect the fuel hose too.<br><br>Overall, a very nice set and well worth getting. It's a bit smallish, but if you remember the size of the average LEGO vehicle at the time... Plus, it's the only X-Wing set not to need a dip in an acetone-RIT dye mix, and you get good parts and figure value for the retail price... So if you can find it for a good price, get it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
