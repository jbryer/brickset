PLUS
*They are loads of brill pieces in this set
*buy thi and a few droid starfighters and you can have an ace battle
*that little crane thingy, i dont know what it is but its cool

MINUS
*the battle droids are extremely flimsy
*as someone said they should have made this set with a plain naboo pilot and a different colour droid, and becuse they won't go in the core ship, throw in a droid starfighter, now that would have been a set (11/10)

YES IF...
You want the battle of naboo, who doesnt

NO IF...
You would rather save up for somethng bigger

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-12T11:23:19Z","Star Wars Dogfighter","         I am totally in to fighter planes and this just may be hard to believe, but I think the Star Wars starfighters are the best lego ones, (basically the only ones). I like the yellow bricks and all of the slopes, it makes the fighter look streamlined. The young Anakin head is pretty cool but why does he fly starfighters in a little Tattoinne robe and an atmosphere helmet? Anyway, the minifigs dont mean much and you get two battle droids, which is easy to build an army. I like the green cones for guns and the cool canopy that must give Anakin alot of visual! Anyway, it also comes with an odd little cart but extra lego's are good. This has some super pieces and I strongly recommend this set to the Star Wars fan or someone who like starfighters and collecting then. A stomping 10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-14T20:28:47Z","Nice set.........!","            This isa  good set.  It has a nice color scheme of yellow. It has a sleek appearance but there are some blocky parts in it. I wish it came with a Nubian pilot rather than young anakin, but it is okay anyway. The lasers are cool but there is no launch tube for the proton torpedoes. Tis' cool and the R2 series is very nice. It heven has a stingray printed on a sloped plate.  This is nice and somewhat resembles the sleek fishlike naboo starfighters of the 1st episode.  Overall this is cool.....!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Jedi_Master_Fangorn","2007-06-12T20:43:33.03Z","Good, but not great","Once I got this set, I liked it a lot better than I thought I might.  It has a great look, with little points trailing from the engines, 2 battle droids, R2-D2, and Anakin.  I have several problems with this set though.  First, this set should have come with an explanation of what the cart-thing is.  I have puzzled over it for eight years now and still don't know what it is!  I had to change the droids' guns to the luminescent red studs instead of what they have originally in this set.  Finally, the cockpit should be able to either fold up or slide down, so that you don't have to take the whole thing off to put in and take out the pilot.  I assume the stingray-icon is the squadron insignia or something.  A better than usual set, but not the best.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-14T13:53:34.107Z","Not the better Naboo fighter, but this still good","This set is one of the star wars sets, and was released in 1999. Like other Star Wars sets from the same year, this space ship wasn't much like the original from the movie, due to some plates and old style pieces, but it still well made, due to the color scheme (yellow, gray, some beige and other colors) and playability. The set includes the minifigure of Anakin, during the episode I, and it looks like really, in lego style. Altough in this set, Anakin have a yellow skin, it is good for some other Lego minifigures, not much for Star Wars (currently, the new star wars minifigures don't have yellow skin). Anakin also includes a helm from the naboo pilots, and the set too includes the R2-D2 minifigure, completely, and with nice details and correct color scheme. On the set, there are too two droid minifigures, well designed, altough the arms don't have the same shape of some new minifigures of battle droids and the weapons are in a old style. A little cart is too included, with basically the beige color and some red or black details. The building is nice, and also the wheels usec on it. The Naboo fighter have the correct color scheme and uses a basic building. The plate under it is good positioned, and the wings, altough aren't the better in details (basically, two different plates with on each extremity basic builted &quot;turbos&quot;), still in a good color scheme. The cockpit is small, but a minifigure can still on it well, it is decent. The back have some blocks increasing, and the R2-D2 stay on it, well, but not the better, it isn't covered as it could be. The front is simple and increased with a block with a triangular shape, don't likes the original so much, and have also two green pieces on each side, making it odd, but it still good. Altough the set don't have a nice building like some new, this is a good option to increase your Star Wars collection and to have a Star Wars ship, good to play with. Overall, another nice (but too have some problems on likeness with the original) Star Wars set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thenaterater","2008-07-12T20:40:50.687Z","what is the tan thing on wheels?","overall, this is a pretty good set, although the new one is much, much better.  i like anakin, and the tan machine on wheels provides for entertainment when you are bored, although i have never been able to figure out what it does.  the ship has a nice cockpit, and i like the computer, it goes well in a car for a speedometer, the yellow antenna pieces fall off often, but look great.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-29T11:29:38.21Z","LEGO Star Wars - Naboo Fighter Review","I got this set as a present a while back. I was really excited when I put this model together and I'm really happy to have this one. It's part of the movie 'Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace'. I like the yellow and gray pieces on this set and you also won't have to worry about stickers. There're 3 printed pieces which look really rare. The whole model is very sturdy. You also get a little vehicle which you can use as a stand for the naboo fighter. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs. We get two more battle droids which can be added to your droid army and you also get another R2-D2 and another Anakin Skywalker in episode I style. Underneath the spaceship you can also see a big laser canon. This set is a must have for all LEGO Star Wars fans and collector's.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Vader_s_Fist_Leader","2010-01-26T02:57:48.357Z","nice!","This set would be good for displays as well as well regular playing use.

You can tell it is an older star wars set because of the blasters and the battle droids do not have an arm that is upright rather than sideways.

I don't really get the purpose of the car-droid type thingy.

I can't quite see what it is but there appears to be a marking near the cockpit.

I like the green cones as proton (or at least I think) canons.

"Plasmodium","2011-05-26T13:02:01.833Z","A classic--from when they used real bricks!","<p>When I was between the ages of 9 and 12, I loved Star Wars. My favourite film, however, was the first one-not the &#39;action packed&#39; (and slightly cheesy) later ones, nor the &#39;classic&#39; (and slightly cheesy) earlier ones. Within that, I always loved the Naboo culture-the architecture, philosophy, gungans, but especially their spaceships.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>I must admit, I picked this set up for about two pounds at a garage sale--at that price, any early Star Wars set gets five stars in that league! It was in a plastic bag, already built, so as soon as I got home, I took it apart and rebuilt it. Unfortunately, it was missing a few pieces, and the first and last two pages of the instruction manual. This meant that until just now, when I looked at the online PDF, I had no idea it was missing the slightly odd looking torpedo launcher from the bottom.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The ship itself is a little wide, and very flat compared to modern models, and looks a little odd, if not downright disproportioned. Thus, the main strength of this set, in my opinion, is the fact that it is built with much more &#39;normal&#39;, &#39;everyday&#39; bricks--I much prefer that to sets which invent new bricks for every situation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Well, what else is there?</div>

<div>Minifigs? Love the Anakin--though it means he looks a bit too tall, I like the bendable legs better. The original face is quite good, and the body is quite nice. Unfortunately, mine came with a plain smiley face, but it did have a grey helmet, which I think looks better.</div>

<div>Artoo: At least this one comes with an entire Artoo, not just a head stuck on the back of the starfighter.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Oh, and as a final note, the weird little beige car thingy: What on earth is it?</div>

"LegoCollector125","2011-08-07T15:57:44.137Z","Attack the Droid Control Ship!","<p>Naboo Fighter was, along&nbsp;with the AAT, my first Episode I set. I'm not really sure why I bought it, as it was never something I liked all that much. Once I had seen the set however, I appreciated the fighter a bit more. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box and instructions are, as always, nice looking, and the instructions differentiate between colors well. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in the set offer some new printed parts, as well as a few new parts in yellow, but otherwise, there isn't anything all that special included in the set. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The set includes the classic R2-D2 minfigure, and the common Anakin Skywalker, this time with a&nbsp; gray helmet. It also includes 2 battle droids.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build of the set showcases a few interesting methods in creating the engines, but otherwise, there isn't anything special about this build. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed fighter isn't bad, but is certainly more blocky that it's redesigns. It does have a nice look to it, and feels very authentic of LEGO. It&nbsp;includes some kind of tan colored repair vehicle as well (not really sure what it is). The set also has pretty good playability by including the battle droids to attack the fighter</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, not a bad set, but if you are looking for movie accuarcy, I recommend the later versions of this set. This one, however, feels more LEGO-like to me. Personally, I prefer this version. I recommend the set if you see it, but don't go out of your way to try and find one. </p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
"fatalleader","2011-06-22T14:59:57.57Z","Needs upgrading","I got this set when a friend gave me part of his Lego collection. I'm currently in the process of upgrading it to be more like the newer ones. Also, I've renamed little Anakin Skywalker to be Anakin Solo. I don't need more than one Anakin Skywalker.<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"peti7788","2022-05-14T23:09:26.697Z","Impressive as a child, disappointing as an adult, good base for MOC","<p>I wanted a Naboo fighter that has a sliding cab roof like in the movie.&nbsp;Lego hasn&#39;t officially released this type of set yet, so I chose the first Naboo fighter because it&rsquo;s the easiest to convert because of the type of windshield.</p>

<p>The Naboo fighter is always great!&nbsp;The shape and color are stunning!&nbsp;It&rsquo;s like a sports car from the 1930s, mixed with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262"" target=""_blank"">Messerschmitt ME 242</a>&nbsp;jet fighter.&nbsp;<strong>A beautiful streamline design.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>But, the designer of this set did not copy the forms well. There is no objection that in 1999 there were not many curved elements.&nbsp;I am not bothered by the sloping elements, it can also be used to build beautiful, and there is a classic space nostalgia for the spacecraft.</p>

<p><strong>What is wrong is the proportions.</strong>&nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t show up to me as a kid, but as an adult, the set was very rough.</p>

<p>The cabin and <strong>cockpit are too close</strong>. It is located after the wing on the original machine.&nbsp;The tail is too thick and slopes downwards, while it should taper upwards.&nbsp;And the lower part is rough, with big special elements typical of the period. Specifically, it is built from <strong>2 large ship parts.&nbsp;</strong>This could have been done with smaller hollow 4x4 or 4x6 inverted slopes.&nbsp;The engine is also a big yellow special part. The stand would have been better built from 2x4 transparent bricks.</p>

<p>Fortunately, very nice printed yellow tiles and sloping bricks are in this set.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>In the first edition Star Wars minifigures, I like the transition period that even their faces are yellow. They clearly indicate from which era it comes, giving it a character.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Not a nice&nbsp;set as an adult, but a durable and usable toy as a child.&nbsp;But more importantly, it is a very good basic set for a MOC.&nbsp;By the way, this is part of history, it was the first lego Naboo fighter.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>This is not a final version, just an experimental model to test the sliding mechanics of the windshield. Unfortunately, the ebay seller didn&rsquo;t send me the right color windshield, but the type is correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I put the cabin 2 studs back because it is behind the wing in the movie version as well. This gave way to the sliding mechanism, which is a technic axle.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52073533766_499f1c363f_k.jpg"" style=""width: 2048px; height: 1152px;"" /></p>

<p>Temporarily cover the technic axle with a 2x3 yellow plate while the cab is closed.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m already remodeling the spacecraft, I&rsquo;ve replaced the engines. I put in a technic gear for details, as in newer versions.</p>
