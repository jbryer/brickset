"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-03T16:58:29.38Z","Poorly designed","The x-Wing fighter was poorly designed! The wings were to short! And there are ski's for the landing gear! SKI'S! Come on! The speeder type thing wasn't the best. The engines were neat! The amount of minifigs were good! This is an okay set.

<p>Well thats pretty much it. I think you should get this set.&nbsp;And remember I DO NOT ACTUALLY OWN THIS. You&nbsp;cant get this in stores anymore.&nbsp;You can still get this on ebay and what not well thats pretty much it. Read my other reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
"DDenissssss","2012-10-17T12:36:20.427Z","Good old-school set","Of course, for those who are used to 6212-like X-wing, this set can look very poorly designed. But it is from old times, when Lego could&nbsp;make excellent sets from a little amount of details, and now it seems like they make a new detail in every case they don't know how to make a part of a set. I was choosing between this one and 4502 (they were only available at that moment) and I chose this one because of Biggs' chequeboard helmet. Yes, this X-wing is smaller and not&nbsp;as detailed as the new ones, you can't move wings simply rotating a gear at the back, but it's easy and interesting to play. You also have a techician from Yavin-4 and Biggs with his awesome helmet&nbsp;so you can make a scene in the rebel hangar.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,4
