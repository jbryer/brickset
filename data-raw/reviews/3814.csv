"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T16:57:36Z","nice","the shape is close to the original slave in the movie. The cool thing is that the wings always stay parallel to the ground, in any position. As in the film, you can put the carbon frozen Han into th slave thanks to a ramp which you can open/close. The thing that is anoying me is it's size. I find it too small, compared to the massive oder slave that you can get, though it's not a bad set and it is much cheaper. It's a good alternative if you want a boba fig with his ship for not too much money

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T11:28:01Z","A ton of errors!","    This set isnt very expensive and it comes with Boba Fett (I like Jango better but......). The first and largest error is it's size. In the movie, the Slave 1 is very big, and it seats more than one person.  The green and brown colors make it the theme color of Boba, and the laser cannons up front are a little too small.  The cockpit is tiny and it uses an odd canopy that should be used on some small town helichopper. The color scheme is a little awkward and it uses some odd slope pieces. I give this a 7 because it has so many errors, I would defanitely prefer the new 2002 Slave 1 that includes Jango with a reversable head, now that is neato! Get it if you want a cheap Slave 1,  or to use it as target practice fro the better Slave 1, your choice..............an average 7. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T20:40:23Z","Slave 1","This slave 1 is cheaper and smaller than the new one but easier to play with. It has everthing you need on this slave 1, a cockpit and a storage ramp. I don't think anyone has complained about its gadgets yet but it doesn't matter if it has no bombs, a jail, a engine and a bigger cockpit because all of them weren't relivant to the slave 1 seen in episode 5. All we new of the slave i back than is that it has a storage ramp and a cockpit.
Now I will move on to the pluses and minus.

Pluses:
* Easy playability
* Cool boba and carbonited han figures
* Nicely detailed and cool storage ramp

Minus:
* Barley anything but the fact that lego could have made it bigger

Overall I recommend this set to anyone who wants to get the origianl coloured slave 1 and don't mind if it doesn't have all the gadgets that the Episode 2 slave 1 has.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AFOSL","2009-05-02T18:19:10.5Z","The Oddest Ship In The Star Wars Universe?","The Slave 1 has always been a peculiar craft, somewhat illogical in design and seemingly impossible to fly, if the laws of physics are to be obeyed.  But this is the Star Wars universe where anything seems possible, even if it means having odd ships like B-Wings, YT 1300's and of course, Firespray patrol ships like the Slave 1.

It's odd design must have given Lego a real headache.  At the time, there were no fancy bricks, no rounded slopes, no smooth gradients, no single peice moulded cockpit canopies.  Not to mention a new, authentic range of colours.  These were all a year or two away.  Lego had to rely on what brick shapes and colours they had to tackle this strange design.  For that, Lego should be commended.  It would seem that the fans were crying out for a Slave 1 craft and Boba minifig, but when it was released, it was not well recieved by many, including myself.

I was on the fence for sometime before finally buying this set.  The look of the craft did nothing for me, but I had to have the all new Boba Fett mini figure.  And what a great little figure he is, complete with jet pack and a grey torso painted with green to match the on screen villain's, with clearly defined breast and abdomen plates.  

Sadly, the craft itself did not measure up to the minifig's high standard.  Those old fashioned bricks and colours were really only half the problem.  Size was another big issue, and the Lego Slave 1 is not to scale with the minifigure or it's on screen counterpart.  To do this with the bricks available would have pushed the model's price upwards, possible in excess of Â£50 and probably would have made the structure quite weak with little playabilty.  It would seem that Lego would rather concentrate on getting the shape right than making another expensive kit and keeping Boba away from a wider audience.
Despite the limited selection of bricks, Lego did manage to keep the shape of the ship as true as possible, as well as adding a couple of nice features which showed attention to detail, even at this price point.

The stabilizer fins are connected to each other via a technic axle that runs transversly through the ship.  These fins, although not connected to the cockpit, do keep their horizontal position whichever way you twist and turn the craft.
The cockpit canopy itself is a two piece hinged affair that allows you to place Boba into his ship without removing the whole canopy.  Boba lays in the cockpit with his feet in the air.  This allows him to be looking forward when the ship is in flight.  He is attatched to his inverted seat, so won't fall about when you pick up the model.

The other moving part on this model is at the rear of the ship.  It's the ramp leading to the storage area for the Han in carbonite brick - another new piece, first seen in this set.  The brick is black with a silver frosted Han painted on one side.  On top sits a 1x2 printed plate, representing life preserving electronic dials and lights.  There is no way for Boba to hold the carbonite piece or glide it towards the ship.

Overall this model reperesents a good effort by Lego to produce a ship so admired by the fans. But despite the effort, the model never really achieves the design it was trying to emulate, being something that is even more peculiar than the real Slave 1.  It's shape is close, but it's too angular, and the colour pallete is way off the mark, especially where the green is concerned.  But this is all down to Lego's limited range of bricks and colours at the time.
Since this model appeared, Lego have revised and remodelled their version of the Slave 1, each model improving greatly on the last. 

If you are a completist Lego collector or have a strong sense of nostalgia, you will have to have this ship. in your collection.  If you just want a Slave 1, I would advise scraping together a lot more pennies and buying the latest incarnation, 6209, which makes up for everything this older model couldn't pull off.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"thetrevmaista","2010-07-26T15:05:55.283Z","A great clasic set!","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set is one of my all time favorite lego star wars sets.I dont see why all these people keep giving bad reveiws saying ""its too small"" or ""it dosent have enough weapons"".Its really not that small, you have pleanty of room for Boba Fett in the cocpit and enough room for Han Solo in the cargo hold.Plus, in the movie we never saw the Slave 1's weapons, just the two gun turrents in the front.&nbsp;And its not like it was made yesterday, it was made 10 years ago as one of the first lego star wars sets! All of them were a little small.Well now that i hopefully proved those other reviewers wrong lets get on to the things i like about this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll start off with the minifigs.You get Han Solo frozen in carbonite,if you count him as a minifig,and my favorite minifig of all Boba Fett!He has a green helmet witch is atached to his jet pack which is really detailed.Especialyfor ten years ago.I also love the wings and how they stay balenced with the ship as you turn it over. And i know that had to be hard for the designers because back then they didn't have alot of speacial pieces to make it do that.Plus this set was really cheap to buy. Only 20 dollars!I wish sets today were like that because now you can't buy a cool set without you having to pay between 70 and 100 dollars or more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also like the cocpit,it has alot of controlls and enough room to fit Boba Fett and a gun.But you will have to make the gun your self because it dosent come with one. And that is the only thing i dont like about it.The boarding ramp is also pretty cool too.Overall it is a fantastic clasic lego star wars set that i believe this is a must have for any one who likes Boba Fett or lego star wars.So please dont listen to those guys who wrote the reviews saying its bad,because its not.Im sure if you buy it you wont regret it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>As I previously mentioned in another review, a while back I made the...decision (really trying to avoid the word ""mistake"" here) to separate my legos by colour in bins.&nbsp; This is a huge pain as most of my Legos are black and grey and finding certain pieces&nbsp;are not always easy.</p>
<p>This brings me to my first compliment about this model.&nbsp; Lots of various colours.&nbsp; grey and black, sure...but they are at a minimum.&nbsp; We have tan, brown, green and some nice clear pieces in this&nbsp;kit (I'll even recognize the 2 shades of grey)</p>
<p>Next we have the unique characters (frozen Hansicle and Boba Fett) which I believe were sold only with this set until the Jabba sets came out quite a bit later.</p>
<p>Lastly this was easy to build, very sturdy, and a great size for its non-gimmicky playability.&nbsp; (rotating turrets, double opening cockpit, auto-rotating wings, opening compartment hatch...)</p>
<p>The only slightly ""grrr"" moment I had with the release of the newer, more expensive&nbsp;version was that it came with additional bounty hunters.&nbsp; A nice touch. TouchÃ© Lego revamp, touchÃ©.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you like the original SW models, could use some more variation in your Lego colour scheme or just have an obsession with Boba Fett...this is the one for you.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set includes a decent amount and selection of parts, but nothing too particularly interesting. There&#39;s two 6x12&nbsp;angle plates in old light gray, as well as several slopes of various sizes and colors, especially green and brown. They don&#39;t add a lot to my collection (mainly since I never take apart my sets), but MOCers will appreciate those, especially if they focus on building natural scenes/scapes (I&#39;m looking at you, slope bricks!). Other pieces worth mentioning, minifigs aside, are the canopy (which comes in 2 hinged sections, the bottom one actually being an old System car roof piece), the printed tiles (5&nbsp;of them in this set, and in old light gray! Great!), the neon orange headlight bricks, and the old light gray classic bricks. We also get a 1x4 plate with 5 prongs, to acommodate&nbsp;the old-style swivel hinges (I always liked those hinges,&nbsp;no idea why LEGO discontinued them :S).&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>We get two minifigures in this set, which feels like an appropriate count for a $20 set. Boba Fett is definitely the protagonist in this aspect (and in the entire set, if you ask me). The torso is cast in old light grey, but has some good printing depicting his Mandalorian armor. It is fairly accurate and has insignias printed on either side of the chest. However, a bit of wear-and-tear&nbsp;detailing (as we would later see in the 2010 version) would have been nice. The legs and arms are unprinted and cast in both shades of old gray. The headpiece is a plain black minifigure&nbsp;head (MOCers and customizers&nbsp;might like the plain elements, especially the arms and legs). Now, on to our Han Solo in Carbonite minifigure (?). Basically, it is just a black&nbsp;1x2x5 column brick, printed with a silver distressed Han on it. It&#39;s not terrible, and it&#39;s fine for the time it was released. However, he&#39;s way too narrow for an actual minifigure&nbsp;(Fortunately, this doesn&#39;t show too much until you compare his&nbsp;width with that of a, well,&nbsp;<em>actual&nbsp;</em>minifigure). On the bright side of things, we do get a nice printed console tile on top to simulate some of the panels around the Carbonite&nbsp;block, that control the prisoner&#39;s hibernation.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build, as is the final result, isn`t particularly appealing or interesting. It begins with placing some angle plates down to create the ship&#39;s silhouette. Afterwards, some randomly colored bricks are added for some structural support, and then come the slopes, as well as the rest of the bricks. There&#39;s no non-SOT (Studs on Top) techniques going on, aside from the Techic used for the pivoting wings and the access ramp at the back. The instructions themselves are fine, easy to follow, and feature scenes from Empire and Jedi on the top of each page! :D</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As earlier stated, nothing outstanding comes from this ship. It&#39;s a sweet little model, but it has its flaws. The whole angular appearance of this probably is the most controversial aspect about this. Personally, I don&#39;t mind that too much, but it definitely detracts from the ship&#39;s accuracy ever so slightly. I do appreciate how the older sets had a blockier appearance to them, letting you know that this was just an approximation to the real thing and how you could as well build anything you wanted using the same pieces. New sets *sometimes* feel like they have some specialized parts... Anyway, the big bummer for many here is the size. The ship is obscenely small, and doesn&#39;t even count with a rotating seat for the pilot. the Han Solo brick slides inside the ramp at the back. It works most of the time, but if you push it far too back or too close and try to force the ramp closed, either the figure gets jammed, or the ramp falls off. The rotatory wings are a nice (and&nbsp;<strong>obligatory</strong>) feature. However, the wings assembly is pretty light and wobbles quite a bit when you try to swoosh it around. The swoosh factor, though, is pretty good here, since the whole ship is pretty sturdy, and the tail doubles as a somewhat comfortable handle for flying the ship around. The cockpit has a rather ugly look to it (many of the randomly colored &#39;skeleton&#39; bricks show in there), but some of it is covered by printed console tiles.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In general, I&#39;d say this set is on the decent end of things. We get a decent minifigure selection, although a third character would have been nice;&nbsp;say, a Stormtrooper (remember Boba&nbsp;hired a Stormie squad to assist him on Bespin), or a Bespin&nbsp;guard, which we didn&#39;t get until 2006. The pieces used for this set are good as well, but there&#39;s so many slopes that even if you&#39;re a habitual MOCer, many of them will just sit around, unused and unloved (especially the double slopes used on the middle of the base. Ugly, chunky big pieces :/).&nbsp;Twenty bucks feels like an okay price for a set like this. Sadly, this is a retired &#39;collector&#39;s item&#39; set, so you&#39;re probably going to pay more&nbsp;than 20 dollars for this set, even if it is used. I give this set a 3.5/5. It&#39;s okay, but not worth going crazy over. Go for more recent incarnations, like 6209 or 75060.</p>
