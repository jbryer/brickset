PLUS
*they make brilliant fleets, buy 50 like me and you'll see what i mean
*the cockpit is really roomy
*some rare pieces, not that you'd break this model up though

MINUS
*yes you new it was coming: th wing connection, suprise suprise its wobbly
* they used blue high-lights, ewww they'ar ugly

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T13:59:06Z","great!","Cool set, the tie fighter is to the empire what the x-wing is to the rebells. It is a must have to all SW collectors. Plus you get a storm trooper, which has actualy nothing to do with the tie, but I won't complain. I have to say I like the way lego always adds a little plus to the sets.

Only thing &quot;wrong&quot; is the way the tie gets attached, in the movies it is hanging on something, not put on some kind of structure.

Still a great set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T18:59:50Z","nice piece of work","This set is a staple for the sw line, and lego renders it in fine form, throwing in a stormtrooper too. It's definately a fun ship to have and has a lot of playability.

Good:
Besides the aforementioned, the canopy opening is absolutely awesome, probably the most satisfying canopy I've found on any sw lego set, just because having the whole front open up with the top makes it easier to get pilot guy in and out

Stormie Fig, as already mentioned

printed Imperial logo pieces, decorating the wings

Bad: 
swoosh factor; hard to fly for two reasons. First is it's big and cumbersome for a fighter plane; much easier to dogfight a micromachines TIE. Second is the wings.

accompanying stand; it's alright, but it doesn't really make so much sense and it's way too wobbly. The ship is better just sitting on its wings.

Because of the the previous two, the following is also a problem: Price. Retails for $20, but for $20 the snow speeder is much more detailed and dense.  

Finally, of course, the wings are wobbly. I don't, however, take that as a pure fault. Remember, the TIE Fighter is the most expendable ship in the galaxy. Who cares if you lose a few because they turned so hard the left wing fell off? In all seriousness, the wobbling also hurts the swoosh factor, but it's satisfying to see wings fly off in mid-flight.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T19:52:19Z","TIE Fighter, Oh Boy!","        I love the TIE fighters and the Imperial fighter jocks! Other than the X-wing and the Millennium Falcon, i love all TIE's. This one is good because it includes a real stormtrooper and a fighter pilot. The TIE fighter is pretty cool although it is a little small and weak looking. It has a little control case and uses the good canopies. I like the lasers cannons but I think the wings could be attached better. I also love the TIE stand. The TIE fighter stands on the little thing like a landing pad. I like reliving the battle of Yavin or Endor. Boy, I am an Impire dude though, so i usually favor the troopers and TIE's. A wooping 10!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T02:16:34Z","Tie fighters, coming in","The lego Tie -fighters are so cool and they really have good play value as well as display value. The stormy and pilot are cool figs and so is the tie-fighter.
It has a few downsides though, the tie-fighters a bit flimsy and the wings keep falling off and the colours are a bit wrong (mainly the blue).
Plus:
* Great Figs
* Great original set
* really cool

Minus:
* Flimsy wings
* Blue highlights (oh well)

Overall, get this set and get 100 if you want to this set is great.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T11:30:09Z","Almost perfect","I'm an absolute maniac for the Empire and all its glorious military hardware, so when I heard the TIE was coming out I got quite excited. When I finally got my grubby hands on one, I wasn't at all disappointed. The size is just right, it looks great, and it has perfectly chosen minifigures - a Stormtrooper, and of course the TIE pilot. Although the pilot is basically a Stormtrooper painted black, he's perfectly adequate and looks just fine when he's in the cockpit, and the Stormtrooper is always welcome. Really, Lego should put a Stormie in every SW set that's got anything to do with the Empire, so it's easier to get tons of them. Also included is a sort of refuelling pylon thingy which acts as a display base for the fighter - it looks flimsy, but in practice the balance is just right and it's never toppled over. There are some minor niggles -the solar panels, while they rarely fall off, are a bit wobbly and make the model feel somewhat unstable. Also the highlights are blue instead of the grey colour of the films, but perhaps that's just me being nit-picky - besides, that way it fits in with the other members of the Lego TIE family. All in all I thoroughly reccomend you get one, especially since it's just been re-released in the TIE Collection boxed set, where you get TWO of them along with Vader's personal fighter and an Expanded Universe droid fighter. None of the lovely, lovely Stormtroopers though... shame.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"BrickPiet44","2008-11-19T10:10:05.53Z","Good set, get some","This set has all the characteristics of the Empire ships

The wings are wobbly and come off sometimes when youâ€™re playing. This should be improved in future designs of SW sets.

Blue instead of grey. I have changed all the blue in all of these SW ships with grey. Does look much better. Blue is consistent with other sets but at one moment Lego should change blue for grey.

Nice on this set:

A black pilot and a white storm trooper. Always good for playability.

A standard for the ship to land on in a landing bay.

Best if you buy two or more of this set, so you can play better with the other ships like the MF.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-15T14:55:11.493Z","It's Not Over Yet","<p>Set #7146 TIE Fighter: This was my first ever Starfighter set from the LEGO Star Wars Theme, this and Twin-Pod Cloud Car were both purchased around the same time and I have not been dissapointed with it ever since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TIE Fighter is the bulk of this set's charm/piece count. You get to build a very sturdy looking and fun starfighter from the original trilogy. The design also looks quite accurate for something built out of LEGO, true it is blockier than the actual ship, but that's the whole point of LEGO. The ship features an opening cockpit to place the Imperial Pilot Mini-Figure, as well as&nbsp;a small stand for display purposes when not in use/docked in a larger vessel. The colors are quite nice as well and stand out well, in fact the TIE Fighter most likely could sit next to any vintage Space Theme vessel and look like it originated in one of those sub-themes. I wish I had a Blacktron to pilot this thing just to see what it would look like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the ship will take you at least thirty minutes maybe more, but when it's done you won't be dissapointed with the results. The TIE has been re-issued once or twice I believe, but all of the different versions are worth owning in my opinion. I think the TIE is a ship who should be coming out once again in all honesty, and I hope that LEGO has plans to re-issue it a third time in one of the new 2011 or 2012 sets. Overall this set is well worth the effort to track down, even if you have a later version of it, you can never have too many TIEs for your display. And the fact that you get not only an Imperial Pilot but also a Stormtrooper is a plus.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"wander099","2011-01-30T19:53:29.283Z","A bit fragile, but a decent ship","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are pretty easy to follow and I don't recall any particularly complex steps.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some pretty good parts.&nbsp; You get a lot of those 1x2 blue grill pieces (from the wings) and black flat plates (also from the wings) that could be used to build other ships.&nbsp; There is also the cockpit to consider.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two minifigures and both are good.&nbsp; The TIE pilot is only found in this set and the TIE Bomber set and the stormtrooper is an expected bonus.&nbsp; In short, it is a good way to add not only a ship to your fleet, but to get another stormtrooper and a TIE pilot.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly simple when it comes to the wings, but the cockpit is a little more complicated.&nbsp; Overall, I would average it out to moderate complexity, something that younger kids might have a bit of difficulty, but is a breeze for older builders.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The ship itself looks great.&nbsp; I know it isn't exactly movie accurate when it comes to the colour, but I do think that it is aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp; It looks especially good when it is set up on the stand.&nbsp; A word of warning though, the ship is not terribly stable on the stand and if you are not particularly careful, it will fall off and break.&nbsp; At least it is easy to reattach the wings, which can also fall off during play.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is better for older children or adults who will have an easy time building it and who will be more careful with it (less likely to break).&nbsp; It is a good way to add a ship to your fleet and a stormtrooper to your army.&nbsp; It also makes a nice display item if it can be placed somewhere where the instability of the ship on the stand is not problematic.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Baron1","2022-04-17T02:52:27.197Z","Decent early Star Wars ship","<p>For being the first of its kind, It&#39;s actually not half bad. Overall, It looks a bit strange in some areas, but if you are buying this for nostalgic or collectors purposes, it doesn&#39;t really matter. Some people have complained about the noise it makes and how it rattles. However, in person, the noise it lets off by shaking it isn&#39;t too bad. And besides, this thing is going to be on display anyway. One final note about the tie fighter itself is that if it&#39;s on a slippery surface such as glass, the wings may tilt outwards which can look weird. Next thing is the stand it comes with, I would never actually put the tie fighter on it as it looks weird, but having it sit next to it really adds a lot of value.</p>

<p>The Final thing about this set itself is the mini figures. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of going for it, but it&#39;s nice to add to the imperial collection. The storm trooper never came in too many sets, and also the tie pilot was quite nice for the time. It only came in one other set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;d give it an 8/10 for its overall display ability and what it was for the time. It is a bit pricey nowadays if you want to pick it up sealed. If you are looking for a good-looking tie fighter, this ain&#39;t it. But if you want to hit those nostalgia marks, this one checks them.</p>
