The incredible thing is, these vehicles fit minifigures!  Today's creator sets don't, and that's a big reason why I haven't purchased one for quite some time.  Sure you could MOD it, but this fits minifigs right out of the box.  A little short on the color scheme, but this was one of the first sets I can remember getting, so it has a special place in my heart. :]",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
