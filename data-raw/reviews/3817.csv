The engines alone are the length of an X-Wing. I like the markings on the helmet. The TIE is also well designed. The color coordination is an awkward approximation of the movie TIE, but the shape and dimensions are on target. A pleasant suprise was Darth Vader having a mean, gray face under that helmet. I liked the set so much I bought a second one.

"A_Brickset_user","2002-01-05T00:00:00Z","","This set has some good points, and with a few modifications it can be really good.  Comes with Vader, a real plus, and a couple cool ships.  No real complaints about the Y-Wing, it's good but the gun turret swings all over the place.  I would have liked to have a high-friction swivel that would make the guns rotatable, but stay put on their own.  As for the Tie Fighter, the design's a little weak.  For some reason, they have you build the thing in pieces, then snap it together.  Unfortunately, the wings are really loose.  Another complaint about the Tie is the moronic colour scheme.  A grey ship actually does look nice.  All the blue on the ship, as well as too many shades of grey make for lousy colour.  I heavily modified mine - replaced all the blue pieces, and streamlined it.  A few sloped bricks attaching the wings better make a more solid model.  I would certainly reccomend buying this set if you can find it, especially if you would have fun tinkering with the Tie Fighter, I know I did.  I also found this set after christmas at a nicely reduced price.  Definitely a worthwhile set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

As an early Star Wars Lego set the two ships are well represented, especially the TIE Advanced (Darth Vader's ship). Nice details and both ships are highly &quot;swooshable&quot;. The only drawbacks are the wings on the TIE loosen after time (a problem with all of the Lego TIE ships)and the laser cannon on the Y-Wing swing around too much.  Overall, a highly playable set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-12T23:57:15Z","Great Set, but easy to fall apart","I agree with everyone that this is a great set. Starts off as a ten in my book. However, the ion cannons on the y wing swing around too much making it look stupid when  playing makes it lose 1 point. the other drawback, which may not be is the Y wing engines come off too easily. I guess if you have tie/a on your butt, its good to show damage when playing but when you are just flying around, it always stinks to lose an engine coming out of hyperdrive. :(  I guess I deducted a point for losing the engine when flying.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-16T20:16:30Z","The Death Star Battle begins.","this is still one of my favourite sets off all time like the y-wing is cool and the tie advanced is even cooler. this is the first set with Vader and its one of the best one swith him in it. everything about this set is good the only reson it didnt get a 10/10 is because i usally save that for big sets and if its a small one it has to be realy good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"david001","2007-03-22T14:54:34.323Z","Double model set","One of the early Star Wars releases, this set contains both a Y-Wing and Darth Vader's TIE fighter (the TIE Advanced).  The Y-Wing model is kinda large, like others have noted the top gun is a bit loose and swivels all over the place.

The TIE advanced is a pretty solid model that is made in sections and then combined: about the only thing missing (easily remedied) is some sort of stand like that provided with the TIE fighter (set number 7146).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2007-10-04T19:55:15.31Z","one of my best","I got this set on Christmas Day 1999. This is a great set to own and to play with. You get a Y wing, Tie fighter, Vader, pilot, and a droid. The Y wing is a perfect companion to my X wing(1999) and the A wing(2000). This is one of my all time favorites and I still love it to this day.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thenaterater","2008-07-12T20:43:18.61Z","great classic","i love that they put two ships in this set, i think they should do that more often in sets.  i love the figures in this set, i love both of the cockpits in the ships, and i love the y-wing's landing gear, i think that if you can get your hands on this, buy it, it is awesome!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"ra226","2012-02-20T01:41:45.197Z","Poor representation--newer models are better in every way","<p>This set falls far short in many ways. &nbsp;First, why did they package the two together? &nbsp;Were they afraid the Y-Wing wouldn't sell unless paired with something more desirable like Vader's TIE fighter? &nbsp;This entire package feels like it was put together by a sales department and not a design department. &nbsp;Looking for Darth Vader? &nbsp;Hope you wanted to spend $50 on this set, 'cause it was the only place you'd find him for quite some time.</p><p><br></p><p>So yes, these models are below average. &nbsp;They suggest what they are, but are grossly simplified. &nbsp;Among other flaws, the Y-Wing's egine struts are off by 45 degrees (anyone who's ever seen the Y-Wing knows what I'm talking about here). &nbsp;The Y-Wing should look equal parts sleek/streamlined (the nose area) and junk yard (the engines and midsection). &nbsp;This rendition is blocky and bland all around.</p><p><br></p><p>The TIE Advanced is slightly better, but also sub-par. &nbsp;There's controversy over whether the TIE Interceptors should be blue or not, but there's never been a question over what color Vader's ride is--clearly black and grey (not blue). &nbsp;This ship, like the Y-Wing, is also over-simplified, but fortunately TIE fighters don't have nearly the detail a Y-Wing has so they can get away with it.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Comes with Darth Vader</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only set that comes with Darth Vader, and it's overpriced</li><li>Bland design: blocky, no detail</li><li>Y-Wing engine struts wrong</li><li>Inexplicable Red hilights in Y-Wing</li><li>TIE Advanced should be grey, not blue</li></ul>
<p>Fortunately there is a very happy ending to this story. &nbsp;In 2007, lego re-made the Y-Wing. &nbsp;7658 is a fantastic Y-Wing. &nbsp;Nice curves, tons of details. &nbsp;And even with the release of Gold Leader's Y-Wing in 2012, I still prefer 7658 (though that's subjective--Gold Leader's is a fine model, too). &nbsp;Further, in 2009 lego re-made the TIE Advanced--the resultant 8017 is much better looking version of Vader's TIE figther. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Final Verdict: Get 7658 and 8017 instead--they're awesome! &nbsp;This set earns 2/5 for a bland representation of two icons that deserved far better.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,3,2
"Chills","2012-09-25T13:26:35.82Z","Cool set in 1999, but falls short compared to recents versions","<p>I had been building Star Wars sets since I was a wee lad in the 1980s and when Lego started releasing sets I just had to break out my wallet. This was the first SW set I ever bought and having it brings back nostalgic memories, so I'm partial to this set. However, by today's standards it is lacking in many areas.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: You get two fighters instead of one. Another review commented that Lego put the two together because they didn't think the Y-Wing was strong enough to stand alone. That makes a lot of sense since the X-Wing was the most popular ship. But two ships for $50 was a good deal.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The builds are fun. You get nice colors on the ships (though blue on the TIE and red on the Y-wing are subject to debate), and a some interesting pieces. Nothing too exciting, though.</li><li>Pro 3: The minifigures were cool at the time, especially Darth Vader. But since Vader is in so many sets now one doesn't need to get this set to have him in your collection.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The ships aren't very movie accurate. First the colors, but also the details. I have the new TIE Advanced 8017 and it is much more accurate than this version. This one's fuselage is too short. The Y-Wing also has flaws, like the engine placement that's not level with the fuselage, and the flat bottom.<br></li><li>Con 2: Both ships (especially the TIE) suffer from poor design regarding the connecting joints. Just like every other TIE of this era the wings pop off easily and are wobbly; as are the Y-Wing's engines.</li><li>Con 3: There's just a general lack of detail with these ships. The bottoms are flat, you don't have any greebling, and the style used to design the sets is dated. Plus, they don't have the extra features found on more recent sets.<br></li></ul>
<p>I honestly like these sets a lot, but more for nostalgic reasons than as a fan looking for purist Star Wars sets. These sets are blocky, very LEGO-Y looking, and not very refined. I think that's part of their charm. If you're looking for a set that's movie-like and has a lot of features then you can pass on these. If you're working to complete an old-school Lego SW collection then I'd pick them up. I'm in the market for a new Y-Wing, not sure which set to pick up, but I'm reading the reviews. ;)<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4
