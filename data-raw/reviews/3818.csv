My only cons for this one is the cockpit has no controls, how does Maul fly this baby? And the landing gear does not fold up. It's an all around good set to own.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-01T10:37:37Z","Aw(no)some !!!","Nice construction, nice minifig. It's totally Dark Side!!
And about the controls, Maul flies his scooter in and this becomes his steering in connection with his infiltrator. I think it's perfect, nobody can steel your ship. Mayby something for car designers, an integrated bike!!
A deffenite must have!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-18T01:16:18Z","Sith Infiltrator","This is my first set from the Star Wars line. All around it is a great set, and pretty underated too. The design is good, Darth Maul is awesome plus there's plenty of playability. 

Pros:
* Awesome Darth Maul minifigure with double lightsaber
* Cool little Sith Speeder included
* Very sleek, mostly sturdy ship

Cons:
* Wobbly wings
* The cockpit has no flight controls",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Kiiranaux","2007-07-02T12:30:25.297Z","Looks better in real life than on the box art.","Even though it's not in my collection, I have this and plan on re-building it soon. This is an excellent set; good controls, sleek design. It looks alot better in realality than on the box.

Pros: 
Darth Maul
Double-bladed lightsaber
sith speeder
sith speeder fits nicely in ship
Fairly inexpensive

Cons:
It's too bad this was made in the 90s, and thus has the old color greys.

I would highly recommend buying this if you find it. It is far better than the 2007 remake.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Obi_Wan9994","2008-07-17T17:10:44.17Z","&quot;This is my apprentice Darth Maul, he will find your lost ship&quot;.","This is an all around great set.

Pros:
Darth Maul mini fig with double bladed lightsaber
3 Probe droids
Speeder Bike- Darth Maul must sit on this while in the cockpit.
Cargo hold- holds lightsaber, probe droids, and binoculars.
Opening and closing wings
Good-sized  ship.
Some good pieces
It's not too expensive
Good Playability

Cons:
Not much detail- but I don't really care
Cockpit isn't very big

I would recommend this to any Star Wars fans, Darth Maul fans(me), but if you aren't into Star Wars this might not be your ideal set. I wouldn't recommend this set to real little kids.

"chonkan","2009-12-01T17:08:03.653Z","this set is one of my favorite ships!","the sith infiltrator is definatly one of my favorite ships!, its better than the new one (my opinion) because then newer version is to slopey and smooth but other people might think im wrong because im not saying dont get it but im a fan of more bulky lego ships thats not to smooth, its very fun to build and i highly recommend this set, anyway lets get to the pros and cons!

"Crazybrick45","2009-06-18T19:43:10.547Z","Great ship... with some flaws. ","This is a pretty good ship. But it is very fragile. Not alot of functions, but still a good set. I watched my cousin build this set at his grandma's house. 

Pros.
Speeder bike
DAAARTH MAAAAAAUL!
Probe droids
Wings move up and down 
Storage compartment to hold accessories(lightsaber, probe droids)

Cons:
Very fragile. 
Darth maul has to sit in the speeder to fit in the cockpit area.


Other than that, it is a nice set. Looks very cool too =]",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Chills","2012-09-12T09:24:04.523Z","""At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.""","<p>I bought this set brand new and it was the 2nd Star Wars set to find its way into my LEGO collection. I was excited to get it because Ep I just came out and I loved the Sith Infiltrator and Darth Maul was an awesome bad-guy. The set has been assembled for the past 13 years, but I recently took it apart to move and got the opportunity to build it again. Fun times and a fun set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: This set has a very LEGO feel to it. It's not dark and sinister looking like the more recent version of the Sith Infiltrator, but that's part of the charm. It looks like the ship enough, but like the TIEs of this era it has stripes of color and isn't as sleek. I like that about this set.<br></li><li>Pro 2: It was a fun build, the instructions are the old-school type where you have to have a good eye to see what parts LEGO adds for each step. There are nicely colored parts, and the build took a decent amount of time for the size.</li><li>Pro 3: Good playability, a storage compartment for the droids and Maul's saber/blades. Plus there's the Sith Speeder that slides into the command section of the ship.</li><li>Pro 4: You get a good example of Darth Maul, a must-have minifigure for your collection.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Like the TIEs of this era the winds and two fuselage sections are held together by weak pins, so the ship isn't as sturdy as the more recent versions.<br></li><li>Con 2: Also like sets of this era there is a lack of minifigures. Recent sets have 3 or more minifigures per set, but this one has only Darth Maul. <br></li></ul>
<p>If you're a fan of the old-school Star Wars sets then this is one for your collection. Darth Maul is a great figure to have in your collection, and the build was a lot of fun. I'm just as happy with this set as I was the day I bought it oh so many years ago.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4
