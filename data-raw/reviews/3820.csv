"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-02T04:53:50Z","Cool set, ut a bit flimsy (which can be fixed though)","Wow. Boba's Slave 1 was already great, so what does that makes this? Very cool copy of the movie spaceship, with great features and secret weapons.  It can open up hatches in different parts, opening up other weapons and features.

The set is a bit flimsy though, especially just below the cockpit area (the white part).  However, LEGO admits this and supplies a reconstruction kit with a few elements to make it sturdier.  So call their hotline if you require this.

All in all it's an utter cool set. Too bad only that it only contains special pieces...

It has loads of secret comparments,Guns,Grenades,jail compartment i could go on for ever. Thats the Really great part, Heres the few problems part. If you want to chase the jedi starfighter through the Astoroid field where do hold the thing. The slave 1 has no where what so ever to hold it. Ive tried everwhere and each time something falls of. The figs are great and Jango looks cool with his Jetpack. And Young Boba fett is GREAT. You may not know but i LOVE the use of short legs like the ewoks. But Bobas hairstyle does make him look like a girl. Whats up with that.Good figs, Good size Good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The pieces are great and the way the cockpit platform turns to balance with the ship when it is held upright is a cool feature.  Should have been $10 cheaper, but still a great buy.  Really wide array of colors and lots of small compartments to store equipment.  At least a third larger than the original!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The two minifigure are great; I like Boba whit the short legs.
It had a lot of moving parts.
It is a great set but it deserve a 9, I think that my only reason that I don’t put a 10 it is because I bought at the same time that the 4504 Millennium Falcon  and it doesn’t compare to that set.

The ship is equipped with twin, pivoting heavy blaster cannons on the bottom, two long range ion cannons that can sweep into the fuselage. It has siesmic charges, a fuel tank, and torpedoes hidden within the fuselage! Jango is the best minifig, You can switch his head around for regular casual mode, and switch it around for the Jango Fett battle mode! Bona is nice but I sometimes despise those little legs. It is an extremely cool build with tons of large, curvy pieces and a humongous cockpit canopy. The stabilizer flaps on the sid are nice and if you turn those, the cockpit turns as well. A marvel of lego, a complete masterpiece by piece!It has some great pre-printed decals like on the back rim, and on some yellow tiles on the flap armor. Alot of pieces flip and show the innards and something hidden within! There isnt much walking room inside of the ship but it is just a  truckload of fun. I would recommend it for ages 10 and up, you wouldnt dare break this. The little cabinet pieces hold Jango's blasters, and they arent loudhailers!!!!! Jango is my favorite character! He is totally unique and awesome, I somehow like him more than Boba but oh well. This is a job-well-done and it has tons of waiting surprises in the construction. The cockpit is also very roomy, so you can fit a whole ton of controls in there. I fit a huge, green HUD screen from Island-Stunts, a lever, a small button tile, a TIE Fighter controller, and a regular control that came with the set!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-01T16:35:58Z","Excellent AOTC set- Get it NOW, since prices for MISB examples are on the rise.","(I got this set some time after it was discontinued, and already it had apreciated to above its MSRP, 50 USD.  For 358 rare, unique parts, though, the price was right.)

This set is a must for any Ep. II lego fan, with its varied and accurate (check your Ep. II Incredible Cross Sections book) complement of weaponry, and a dramatic improvement over the hapless year 2000 slave I.  For starters, the forward laser cannons located at the bottom of the hull have a ratcheting, almost-360 degree rotation.  It has two hidden 4-barrel laser cannons that pop out of hatches located directly below the tan &quot;wings&quot; of the ship--- Those laser cannons are a cool touch.  Near the forward laser cannons are two dk. grey cabinets that hold Jango Fett's blaster pistols, which are the same as the ones from the Wild West sets, not new moldings. :( 
  Another hidden weapon that Slave I holds is its cache of 2 concussion missiles, located benath the white panels that make up the front of the hull.  Finally, this ship has the ability to drop 3 trans-orange seismic charges, but only when resting on its &quot;back&quot;, not in upright flight position.  
  I have few quibbles with this set.  Here they are:
The seismic charges are orange, not blue, their color in Ep. II, the use of yellow bricks is far too extensive, the cockpit windscreen doesn't have a hinge for easy entry, and the set is *somewhat* flimsy.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Also, this set has tons of features including two little storage compartments, rotating blasters, and other missles that can be tucked away inside the ship.  One of the best features is the bomb-dropper.  It releaes three little orange bombs on the enemy.  On the whole, the ship is huge considering it only has about 350 pieces.  It also has many unique pieces which are worth getting.  But obviously, the best part about this set is the minifigs.  Jango is awsome!  I love the blue coloring on the helmet and body.

Let's see....aw yes! It comes with rare jango fett minifigure with helmet, pistols, and the works; oh, and his head has two faces: a black face for the helmet and his real face for his hair that he comes with!:D Also, it comes with rare young boba fett minifig too; however, his little legs can't bend which is okay. Now, on to the amazing model! Let's see his ship is MUCH better designed than the old Boba Fett's Slave I with rotating wings and a two-passenger cockpit. Also, the ship comes with other neat little extras such as hidden rockets and blaster cannons, dropping bombs, rotating guns, compartments for jango's hair and pistols, a magnetically connected box container in the back, and numbered bags for easy build. However, there is one small, tiny, little problem with the construction: in the beginning stages of the build, the model is very fragil and easily breakable.

"AFOSL","2009-05-03T18:15:29.437Z","An Excellent 2nd Try For This Challenging Design.","2002 was an excllent year for the Star Wars Lego collector.  A new film had just been released, giving Lego another year of great new models, many of which included the new designs in brick and whole new range of colours.  It was an exciting time, and with the release of the new film, the Lego Star Wars models were proving more popular than before.
One ship to enjoy this popularity was Jango Fett's Slave 1. 

From looking at the box art, you could instantly see that this model was very different from the earlier one released in 2000.  The box gave you a glimpse of what was inside - the new bricks, the authentic colours, the added details.  What it didn't give away was any real hint of the model's size.
No doubt a lot of people would be comparing this model to the first Slave 1 and had a lot of questions that needed answering.

The build starts, as usual, with the assembly of the minifigures.  Two are included in this set - Jango Fett and his young son, Boba.  Both figures are unique to this set, at the time of writing, Jango in particular, being of special interest for the collector.
Jango uses the same jetpack and helmet mold found on the earlier adult Boba minifigure, but is silver instead of green.  The helmet markings are painted on in black and two shades of blue.  The helmet slips over a black head piece as before, but Jango's head piece is printed on one side with Jango's face.  Remove the helmet/jetpack, twist the head, add the included black hair piece, and voila! You have a Jango Fett that can move around without all of his combat gear strapped on.  A neat little touch.
Jango's Torso is grey with silver armour plates painted on.  Very flash!  His arms are purple!  
This colour seems to have been added especially for the Jango Fett figure and the larger Technic model of Jango, released around the same time.
Jango's legs are also moulded in this new funky purple colour.  A very unique mini figure, indeed.
The young Boba figure is less spectacular, legs and torso molded in baby blue, the torso having some detail paintwork to depict the tunic Boba wears.
Boba's legs are of the short, non posable type and his hair is of the long type, not often seen in the Star Wars Lego universe.  It is molded in black, of course.

Moving on to the ship, and construction begins with the lower rear portion of the model where you are instantly introduced to a new part in a new colour - rounded slopes in dark blue!
As construction moves on there is some use of standard bricks in standard colours - bright reds, blues and yellows.  These turn out to be hidden in later stages, so don't panic.  This part of the build is in 16 stages and concentrates on the loading ramp and bomb bay doors.  These are mounted on click hinges, so won't fall open willy nilly.  Included here are 3 transparent orange globes (siesmic charges), more dark blue elements and even more new round slope pieces in another cool new colour - sand green!
The next stage deals with the lower front part of the ship and poses no problems in construction.  Once again, plenty of dark blue and sand green slopes are used, as well as white slopes and round bricks.
This front section then connects to the back section to form the overall base of the model.  Things are shaping up.
The next stage of construcion is fairly lengthy and deals with the bulk, center section.  Here you are introduced to some Technic axles and two 10x1 Technic bricks.  Along with a magnet, this little part of the construction seems to have no purpose, but lets move on.
This little section adds bracing to the conjoined front and rear sections you built earlier, and it is now apparent that the Technic axles will be used to attach the stabilizer wings.  But what is that magnet for?
This middle section also contains the cockpit which is mounted on  the Technic axles, so it can rotate with the stabilizer fins, thereby staying upright at all times.  What's more, both figures will fit into this cockpit at the same time as there is plenty of room. 
The rest of the middle section fills up with more bricks of various shapes and colours, including opening hatches which conceal hidden cannons.
At this stage, you end up with a rather non descript looking lump.

Moving on to the sides of the model and you are faced with a flimsy construction with the new slope pices in black, mounted vertically - two on each side of the ship.
Next up, you move briefly on to the underside of the ship and finally find out what that magnet is for.  It seems Jango's Slave 1 comes complete with a prison cell.  This is a box with hinged doors on either end.  On top of the box sits a magnet.  This small construction then slides into place inside the ship, from underneath, held by the other magnet.
This is a nice design which will add a lot of playability for younger collectors.

Moving back to the sides of the ship, and it is now time to build the stabilizer fins.  These are nicely detailed, using a combination of basic bricks and plates, Technic, and what look like parts borrowed from Bionicles.  I could be wrong. These are all moulded in the relevant colours - Tan mostly, with some greys and details in yellow.  
You are instructed to build two of these, and they are then attached to big grey cones.  The finished constructions then slide over the Technic axles, one either side of the model, between the flimsy upright black slopes.  It actually looks very realistic, and shows how much attention to detail Lego have put in to this Slave 1, and shows that it the design really benefitted from the use of the newly designed bricks.

Moving to the underside of the craft, you are required to add seven exhaust ports and a large radar dish at the front.  These also raise the craft off the ground a little and lift the prison cell clear so it is fully supported only by the magnet.

Topside again and it is time to add the tail end of Slave 1.  This isn't just a block thrown together with only the absolute minimum number of bricks.  Not a drop of imagination is wasted.
This top rear section contains storage compartments and an engine which is accessable via hinged service hatches either side.  It also houses the four cannons which are mounted on plates with an axle underneath.  Two cannons per plate.  These then slot into a brick mounted either side of the tail.  The cool thing is that these cannons don't swing freely, but click into place as you turn them.  This allows you to line up the cannons perfectly either side, making for a much more eye catching model.
This tail construction then fits into place on top of the rear of the ship and to finish things off, a large one piece canopy in a transparent smokey colour sits over the front half of the ship.

Overall this is a very enjoyable ship to build with engaging instructions, up to Lego's usual high standards.
Only two things stand out in my mind as slight flaws.  The first is the flimsy design of the stabilizer guards - the black upright slopes - which tend to fall off if the ship is held wrong.  The other gripe is minor.  Although the scale of the ship is better than that of the 2000 model, and the overall design is excellent and life like, I can't help but think that the ship is a little too short and stubby.  It needs stretching out by a few studs just to give it a more balanced appearance.
Otherwise, this is an excellent model and well worth it's original price tag.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Phantom","2010-10-19T13:38:53.83Z","Best set for the Episode 2 line, and best Slave 1 ever Made!","<p>I recently got this with both minifigs on ebay for just under £100 and as soon as i popped in the minifigs on the cockpit, i was very impressed.<br/>In my opinion, this has the most functions, i even prefer it over the new one which has an rrp of £80! RIP OFF!<br/>I bought this for about £90, and i understand the rrp was 44.99, this was long discontinued-and mine came with the minifigs! and im certain that the price was so high because of Jango's prescence, who we all know is very rare and sells for very high ammounts of money-some are even going for £40-50! In my opinion this is insane, but i do love Jango, and was prepared to pay that for him. Now, onto the magnificent set.</p>
<p>This has so many guns, secret compartments, the cockpit is the most detailed, ill start with the charges, located in the back of the slave 1, i was a little confused at first on how to drop the trans-orange minifigure heads out of the slave 1 in flying mode, but i soon figured out you're supposed to turn it to landing mode and flip the compartment and they drop out! God knows how many times ive lost them!<br/>Theres also hidden guns, which you can pull out of the side of the ship. Most probably cant tell they're there, but my friend managed to guess theres atleast something behind the panels, and believe it or not, he actually knew they were probably guns or bombs! Spooky? or just a bad way of hiding guns. Luckily, lego's brains were still working back in 2002 and the stupid flickfire missiles did not exist back then! Bravo!<br/>There are some rotating cannons at the top-not much to say-they move! and thats about it!<br/>Right next to the cannons however, are two panels which you can open to reveal two rockets or possibly bombs(they look like rockets!But i could be wrong) and a...engine? Hyperdrive? Im guessing its an engine-but its TINY, i prefer to call it a hyperdrive, just so when people see it, they dont start giggling at my beautiful starship which is supposed to be very menacing! But anyways, on to one of my FAVOURITE parts, the prison cell! I just love it! genious invention, with a magnet too so you dont have to fiddle with attaching it to studs which is not very proffessional-or effective as jango would get blown to bits if he came out of the ship to re-attach the cell-it also makes a good escape pod!<br/>The cockpit is very good-for the time, and the best one(sadly) out of all the slave 1's released, you can fit both figures(jango and boba) in the cockpit-staying true to the move of course! it rotates with the balancers(yes i did forget what they were called) as you turn the ship from landing to flying mode! Very clever! not really but hey! its still good!<br/></p>
<p>Now for the....not so good parts of the ship, lets begin!<br/>Well, one thing is that, it needs definetly more surface detailing, the new one has covered that already but c'mon lego! just because it was 2002 does not mean skipping out a few of those small grills to make the set more attractive to the human eye.<br/>And number two-now this here is a really big fault and ive spent countless hours trying to fix this and make this look good! Why o why Lego did you make a gaping hole in the back of the ship? Its all messed up! Gah! Yes you can call it an entrance, but what kind of entrance on this planet has 2 cannons and a hole the size of a minifigure on the floor of it? This was clearly being lazy! Atleast add a flat plate to cover it up.<br/>and lastly, the engines are a letdown, i mean, a couple of round bumps can barely make a car go 10mph, yet this is supposed to be a very fast bounty hunter starship that can go into hyperspace? Really? The 2006 vers had more detailed engines but, considering they improved it in 2006 and 2010, i forgive lego.<br/><br/>Overall: This is something you should buy, its great in all aspects, the cons are really just me being picky on this wonderful set on why they made some of the features quite weak-and silly! but overall-this gets a 5/5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legofan266","2011-07-10T23:30:03.19Z","""Dad Look!!""","<p><strong>Jango Fett: </strong></p>
<p>Jango Fett is an exclusive figure and only ever comes in this set. He is a very popular figure for many reasons; he comes with a really awesome jet pack/helmet piece with blue and silver marks on it. He has a double sided head which not many Star Wars figures have double sided heads. On one side he has the black face and on the other he has his real face ;D He also comes with his hair piece which means you can take his jet pack/helmet&nbsp;piece off and turn his head around and put his hair on like in the movie ;P also he&nbsp;has a very nice armour piece&nbsp;and this figure also comes with 2 pistols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Young Boba Fett:</strong></p>
<p>This figure is also exclusive to this set. He may not be as rare as Jango, but his still a&nbsp;pretty rare figure to get. He sits behind Jango in the cockpit and travels with him until&nbsp;Jango gets killed by Mace Windu. He has long hair like Anakin Skywalker but a black version of his hair. He has short legs because in the movie he was just a kid and ofcourse we get to see him as grown up&nbsp;Boba Fett in the Trilogy movies. This figure does not come with any weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Slave 1: </strong>This vehicle is seen in episode II at the start when Obi-won goes to Kamino and meets him and ofcourse they escape with the ship. Obi-won then chases him through the astroid field&nbsp;with his starfighter. There are a couple of weapons that are seen in the movie, that are also found in the ship. There is some rockets on either side in the nose section. These however do not flick like flick-fire missiles. There are also rockets that fold out side ways. These are my favourite because they away&nbsp;very well into the ship.&nbsp;There are also bombs as seen in the movie which cut through all the astroids. The bombs work okay, but not as good as the bomb system in 6209. There are also the laser cannons on the nose section that rotate. There are also some features that are not really movie accurate, but there still included and i'm glad they are :D such as the storage compartment that attaches to the vehicle by a magnet. Also the storage compartments on the sides that include Jango's guns and his hair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This&nbsp;is a very cool set, if you just want to get the figures, but keep in mind that this set is discontinued and it's not going to be very cheap. This is a pretty popular set (mainly because of Jango) and it's going to be probably pretty expensive. If you are going to buy it, i recommend you buy it used, because it's going to be a lot cheaper than sealed ;/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<p>- 2 exclusive and very rare minifigs</p>
<p>- Lots of weapons and features</p>
<p>- Lots of printed pieces and no stickers</p>
<p>- The magnet attaches very well&nbsp;also a very unique function</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- A bit over priced for the piece count</p>
<p>- Could of worked on the bomb system a little more</p>
<p>- The colours are a bit mixed up: dark blue, sand green, yellow, black, red, light gray, dark gray</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3
"Malurus","2012-08-11T13:45:34.977Z","""Boba, pack your things. We're leaving""","<p>As seen in Star Wars Bounty Hunter, Slave I was a ship on the moon prison&nbsp;of Ovoo IV, untill Jango busted in, stole it, and made it his own. I wanted the set mainly for Jango, as he's one of my favorite Bounty Hunters, (other ones Boba, of course) but young Boba and the ship really were awesome. The detail was nice and&nbsp;I liked the magnetic cargo hold. The storage holders for Jango's hair and customized&nbsp;twin Westar-34 pistols was really nice. the storge hold for the rockets made me laugh, and the bomb dropper was quite the touch. the two quad cannons are cool in space battle.It was well worth the wait!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"cderickson","2013-02-01T13:45:02.973Z","There are no Bounty hunters here, the Geonosions don't trust them...","<p>As a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;fan&nbsp;of star wars lego&nbsp;sets this is one of my favorite. From what i remember there were a few discrepencies between the movie version and this but its almost perfect in my opinion. The price (when purchased years ago) was $50 which seemed a little high but it is a fairly large ship compared to the average size.</p>
<p>Characters:<br/>Jango &amp; boy Bobo Fett; As far as i know this is the only set these characters appeared in so pretty rare. As far as i know Jango was one of the first figures to have reversible face.</p>
<p>Ship: <br/>If you cut the ship down the center it is symmetrical, but it still a blast to build. The wing guards can be a little difficult to stay on but other than that no complaints.</p>
<p>It is a pretty sweet set to have in your collection and is especially cool if you have 7143 (Jedi Starfighter w/ Obi Wan) to sit next to it.</p>
<p>I would recommend this to really anyone, kid, adult, collector.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
