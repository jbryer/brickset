"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-04T17:18:55Z","Only O-K"," Righto, this set nearly gets squashed by the alliance and imperial ships (Or, anything that is manned by a fig). It does have the awesome skid piece on the bottom but i would say that this thing is formidable with all those bristling guns poking out of everywhere but those nutty battle droids kindof get on my nerves. Heres the cons and pros.

Pros: Neat &quot;battleground&quot; plaything
moderate playability
pretty darn cheap
good skid piece+ large firepower
cons; 
should be a tinge larger
hard to put back together
no REAL landing gear
not the most realistic version of the real thang

anyways, virtually realitied a good set, if you are big on getting a collection of battledroid vehicles. Chow!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-12T05:44:22Z","Not bad, Not bad at all","Well i think it could have been more expensive and i still would have bought it, it is definately worth &#163;20:

PLUS:
*Just look at it darn it, it's well cool
*Some nice tan saucer plates
*I didnt expect it to have an interiour, it's only little  but it's better than i expected

MINUS:
*I don't know, there is just something about it that you can't put your finger on
*It should have come with more battle droids
*The side cannon/lasers things look a bit wierd

YES IF:
You want a decent set which is very useful for making battles and stuff.

NO IF:
You want something thats, dead on, something which is perfect (a.k.a your fussy).

OVERALL:
Well worth a look, but it's probably discontinued now
Buy it if you see it though.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-01T22:14:34Z","I've got one word for you: COOOOOOL!","Oh man, this set is cool! I love how the hatch opens and that there are two battle droids instead of one. The additional blasters in the back are useful, and they made it extremely accurate and I like the battering ram pieces. The cannon is moveable up, down, left, and right. The only thing is that I wish the cannon swiveled around 360 degrees, because I put Jar Jar Binks on there, and it just wasn't good enough. Overall, I give this set a 10/10 because it has a lot of useful pieces, and it so cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T21:16:57Z","Totally Awesome.","   The Armoured Assault Tank is very neat, and because I have the Star Wars Battlefront for PS2, I know what these babies can do! This set rocks, it has every laser cannon battery and turret, battle droids, and the armor plate that guards the engine. It even has the hatch for driver to occupy. I love the way the gun sounds in the movie. It has an upward part that has the main cannons and a balst shield generater near the middle. It aslo comes with one regular battle droid with laser rifle. It even has the smaller guns in the middle. This is very detailed and can pack a punch to any Episode 1 set.  I love these sets, the starwars ones give off memories. A walloping 10. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

the design is awsome besides for the holes in the front and the blue bricks (i have no idea what those were for.
nice place for the guns looks like it did in the movie has a good cannon 2 droids neat decals and its an amazing set get it off ebay or build it back out of ur friends lego bin that has hundeds of old broken sets lol like my friends bin â˜º",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-16T17:41:36.153Z","Awesome droid artillery!","Whenever I have a battle, this one goes in front of everyting else in my droid army!

Pros:
Very good looking from the front
Two battle droids
Lots of very noticeable guns
Realistic looks

Cons:
A bit topheavy 
A little too big to fit on a baseplate with the rest of my droids!

Altogether, a very well put together little droid, sir.

The tank looks like it in the movie, and looks EXACTLY the way it should be. Buy it, buy it, buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There should be more battle droids

"starwarsgeek101_","2009-01-31T08:24:44.623Z","Wow! Amazing!","This set could not be better! I purchased this set from eBay for a quite expensive price, but it was easily worth it! This set is amazingly detailed with a turning gun that a battle droid sits in, a ""driver's"" seat in the front, and two engines. The only flaw is that in order for the lid on the turning gun to close all the way, you need to put the battle droid in a crouching position. Otherwise, if I was back in 2000, I would have bought a ton of these!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The hatch;

"CFL_fan777","2009-03-07T19:37:30.75Z","AAT Review","This is an average set. The printed pieces on the front of it are great. In the back of the AAT there are two blaster holders which work well and there is also a compartment for binoculars in the top of AAT. When I first looked at this lego set I didn't expect that two battle droids could fit in it. I found out that one is able to sit in the top cockpit and another is put under the printed piece with the orange circle printed on it. The color scheme is good bu the ship its self seems bulky and out of place in some areas. Two battle droids come with this lego set (no backplates).

"Kalhiki","2010-08-18T19:24:49.173Z","Probably one of my favorite Star Wars sets","Yes, this set is amazing. I don't have the new one, so I don't know how it stands up to this, but it's still a good set.<br>BUILDING EXPERIENCE<br>Building experience was great. It was a little simple, but in the end, it was worth it. There are no sticker because it is an older set. There is no happy little mechanism to turn the turret, so no gear function to build there.<br>MINIFIGS<br>In this set you get two battle droids. I was always a fan of battle droids, so I like them. For Lego, they are a good representation of how they looked in the movie.For them you have forward and back at the legs (they are connected), shoulder rotation, and head bobbing action. No, there isn't much compared to regular minifigs, but still good.<br>PARTS<br>You get good parts. Especially since they're in brown and tan. You don't see that in many sets. The droids themselves are also good for parts as well. I do also like the UFO plates on the front.<br>PLAYABILITY<br>The only reason I rated it a four was because you don't have anybody to fight. Gungans or Naboo patrol people would be good. But what you do get is good. You also can turn the turret, but not a full 360 degrees. You can also move the gun up and down on the turret. The top of the turret can also open where one of the droids sits. The other droid sits near the front, but you have to pull off the roof to get him in.<br>ANYTHING ELSE<br>The droids have guns which nicely store on the tank. The tank has some smooth pieces so you can slide it along the floor. However, these pieces are only at the front, so the back will sometimes fall backwards. There is one thing I don't understand though. You know how sometimes Lego uses oddly colored pieces on the inside of some sets like blue or red? They seemed to have done the same on this set using blue bricks, but they didn't cover them. They are sticking out the back where they are clearly visible. I don't know if they were meant to be some sort of propulsion or thrusters, but it doesn't look good.<br>OVERALL AND VALUE<br>Overall, for around twenty bucks, I'd say get it. I think that was the original price, and that's spot on. A little over is fine, but keep it around that range. I highly recommend this set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
