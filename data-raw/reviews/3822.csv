I passed on but then, little Anakin's lego head just looked out on me and was smiling (On the Package), so I purchased it! It is a fine set, with a nice little arch that is Tatooine tan! The pod racers are unique but looks way to afterthoughtious! I also like the blue Soro-Suub range speeder! This isa  small and practically worthless set, but it is a Star Wars set and it is lego, so I just go ahead and snatch it!

"jinxjinx550","2009-12-20T20:30:54.967Z","Good Value for a Starter Set","A bucket of Legos -- any Legos -- is a great way for a little kid to start playing with Lego bricks.  Make it a Star Wars bucket, and you've got a great intro to the modern hobby.

Three minifigs, including small kid Anakin, Jar Jar (who is liked by nobody BUT little kids) and an alien, are just about right for a set that lets you build a total of three podracers.  There's lots to make, techniques to learn and compare, and you can do things (swoosh, mainly) with the racers once you finish them.  Then you can put them back in the bucket, which is less than half full once you finish, leaving you wanting more Star Wars sets.  Because come on, mom -- you already HAVE someplace to put them, right?

I almost forgot to mention the little construction that looks like a very distant version of the podrace coliseum.  It's good for tan pieces, and I guess it teaches a bit of perspective.   But heck, we're creating new Lego fans here, not building a city.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"goldfish","2012-02-05T08:47:34.213Z","Interesting entry set to the World of Star Wars Lego","<p>The Podracer bucket 7159 is an unusual and almost unique set, in that Lego never really continued the experiment of targetting the younger audience with what was in effect&nbsp;a&nbsp;style of packaging and marketing that specifically appealed to younger children. It therefore continues to be an interesting piece both&nbsp;for the AFOL collector, and also for somebody who wants to make Star Wars Lego slightly more accessible to their&nbsp;younger children. This is quite an appealing concept, as many of the newer Star Wars lego sets, whilst getting better in terms of design and detail, seem to be gradually appealing to the adut market more &amp; more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll do a quick&nbsp;bullet summary of the pros &amp; cons of the set below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three minifigs, Anakin, Jar-Jar and the less well known Aldar Beedo. 
<li>Three colourful podracers. 
<li>External&nbsp;tower structure. 
<li>The basic looking podracers and early figures have a certain charm to them. 
<li>Introduces a few interesting parts that younger builders may&nbsp;not have seen before. 
<li>The set with bucket is an interesting talking point &amp; collectors piece.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exact detail is not exactly the point of the set, but the accuracy of the podracers could be called in to question. Certainly there is a big jump in detail between Aldar Beedo's podracer &nbsp;is this set, and his pod in the set 7186, Watto's Junkyard.&nbsp; 
<li>As time goes by this set is getting harder to find, epecially new.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although getting harder to obtain now, if you can pick this up, I think it is a worthy part of any Star Wars Lego collection. It adds a great contrast to the more detailed sets that are about now, and also gives an insight in to the way the Star Wars lego licence and sets have evolved. Finally, as stated, it really appeals to the younger fan and is a great entry point in to the world of Star War lego. </p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
