"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T17:41:14Z","Slight, slim, and narrow goodness"," I will occasionally build any set i get. However, this set, since I was young and dumb, though it was a spaceship. I bult it and the mini-figs are cool. I just dispise Jar jar. He looks like the most idiotic pupil-less wretch. The sub has some unique blue elements and some cool canopies. Perfect for rebuilding it into a spaceship and make it fight droid starfighters and ties. I think the aspsct of making a giant sub is cool, and it is at most part watertight, put i think it was a cheap idea to make this thing. I like some of the pieces and i think if you want a sub and want to somehow recreate the seen in the movie, have at this, otherwaise, spend the money on a perfect x-wing or the slave 1,(My favorite ships in starwars).

The only annoying thing was the grip jar-jar's head had to his body and that it would have been cooler if the was one big cockpit but three is just as good. Although I already had the qui-Gon and Jar-JAr minifig, I still loved combining the naboo swamp and this set together. Although I lost Obi-Wans hood I still play with this set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T08:39:17Z","Love it","I like this set despise what others say, and I reacon it is a great set, the only downsides being the three cockpits and the Jar Jar grip to his body. I agree with Jobi-Wan and Saleem, this wouldn't be an episode one set without.
GAZZA and Zero, you do not appreiciate good lego sets when you see them. ZERO- how can you rate a set if you havn't even built it. GAZZA- Get a hampster and stop whinging",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-04T03:10:53.84Z","A bad idea","Lego's Star Wars sets have generally kept a good balance between accuracy and playability. The Gungan submarine, unfortunately, gets neither right.

In the movie, the submarine was quite a large vehicle, yet Lego has decided to release it as a medium-sized kit. This has caused it to be downsized considerably. The three-person cockpit has been split into three separate sections, one of which detaches for reasons that are not entirely clear. The end results looks nothing like it's film counterpart, which is a real shame.

The quality of the design leaves much to be desired, too. While the set has a few interesting features, notably the ingenious tail, it does not manage to reproduce the organic look of the movie version. However, that pales in comparison to the quality of the underside: it is simply a featureless, flat plate. Whether this was done to reduce the brick count or make the model lighter, I can't tell, but it looks extremely cheap and does not present well.

Playability suffers because of this, as the model has the feel of a building rather than a vehicle; top-heavy, clumsy and thanks to the large tail, quite unwieldy. The barren cockpits and lack of props or features (apart from the spinning engine and detachable front section) limit playability even further.

On the plus side, the included minifigs are perfectly fine and the set does offer a lot of usable bricks. If you must complete your Star Wars collection, this set may be good enough, but I cannot recommend it in good conscience.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legolord909","2010-01-02T11:49:12Z","Some variety in Lego Star Wars","This is a fun set to build and it is very unique compared to the other episode 1 sets.  The design was well thought out by lego.  It looks good, and it is very solid.  The gungan sub was released in 1999, but it still stands on my shelf to this day, and that is because of its sturdy design.  Also, the blue coloration looks very nice and creates that underwater feeling.  

The main con to this set is that it is not movie accurate, which kind of bugs me.  In the movie, qui-gon, obi-wan, and jar-jar were all sitting in the same central cabin area.  In the lego, there are three seperate cockpits, one for each character.  To me, that doesn't make sense.

Still, this a great set and well worth the money if you can get your hands on one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros
Underwater Scenery
Good detail
Attachable parts

Cons
In the film they sit two at the front and 1 at the back
In the film they all sit in the same cockpit

Minifigs
Jar Jar- You cant the head off his body, but good detail
Qui-Gon- Cool hairpiece
Obi-Wan- Whats with the hood?
Fish monster- Good addition to the set

Get it if 
Youre not bothered about the flaws

"UFO_and_Insectoids","2010-04-19T19:39:14.17Z","""There's Always A Bigger Fish!""","<p>I'll start by saying that part of what makes this set unique to me is that I didn't actually get it when it was in stores when the movie came out. One of my neighbors actually gave it to me when they were getting rid of stuff they didn't need about a year ago. It was in pretty good condition except for maybe a few missing parts. Enough history though, onto the review. The set in general is pretty good, except for the accuracy of the design in comparison to the movie. In the movie, all the characters sat in the same cockpit, not 3 seperate ones. I also think it would have been cool if it had included the giant fish that attacked them in the movie and not just a stingray. Here are the pro's and con's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pro's:</p>
<p>-Cool minifig's including Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. (Personally though I think the character of Jar Jar was kind of lame!)</p>
<p>-Creative sub designs and parts&nbsp;(ex. the design on the windows &amp; storage compartment)</p>
<p>-Storage compartment on back of the sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con's:</p>
<p>-Not totally accurate with the design on the movie</p>
<p>-Could have included more (ex. The ""Bigger Fish"")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is a good set and I would recommend it to any lego Star Wars fan!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"HQuiff","2009-03-09T15:22:55.89Z","Zoom! Wahoo!","What an amazing set! It was one of my first but boy, it's fun, well designed, and realistic to the movie. It's the best set of it's year. The parts are great, along with nice minifigs and great functions!
Pros:
1. Great look! Amazingly like the movie.
2. Fantastic Engines and it's moveable.
3. The thing near the engine at the back can fold down to reveal a proper engine room!
4. All the windows for the people (And Jar-Jar) can open and close fully.
5. Front anchor is a nice addition.
6. Rare pieces and minifigs!
7. Opening compartments.
Cons:
1. Engines pieces full off sometimes.
2. The Engine room lacks a few things to it.
Overall a great set and great for it's time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CFL_fan777","2009-03-07T20:00:30.45Z","Gungan Sub","This is one of the only underwater lego sets ever made. The build is pretty fun and is divided into three pieces: the front of the sub with the anchor to the back cockpit, back part of the ship (the other two cockpits) and the scene including a clam, rocks, seaweed, star fish and a manta ray. The scene is a nice assessory to the sub and looks good on display. The sub's cockpits are done with printed controls and are roomy. The printed bubbles (cockpit) look nice with the blue color sceme. With the gungan sub you can make many vechicles (made for play-ability). You can also put different motors on the back of the sub. They are stored below the printed pieces in the middle of the back. My personal favorite is the one pictured on the box/instructions though. The figures that come with this are: jar jar binks, qui gon qinn and obi wan kenobi (with hood).

"ShatteredGnome","2009-10-06T21:22:58.827Z","One of the best from '99","Okay, the only reason I wanted this set was because it was the only one with obi-wan from 1999, before jedi defense sets. Actually, I played with this quite a bit when I was little. Anyway, this set included some pointless playability:<br>-front cockpit detaches<br>-two side compartments and engine compartment house some<br>extra engine pieces you can use to combine with detached part or <br>the entire sub<br>Also, this set includes a stingray. Pointless... well, kinda.<br>Overall, this set was as faithful to the real thing as you could get in '99.
