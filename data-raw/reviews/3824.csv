"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-04T00:00:00Z","","This is a great set to build, but a bit too heavy for small kids to play with. I got mine at a discount, but the normal price of more than $150 (SEK 1199) here in Sweden is a bit too high. As a Star Wars set this is excellent, with many details and minifigs. The parts are in a lot of unusual colors and shapes, which I like for the possibilities to build new things.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-02T05:49:04Z","A very good set","A very good set all in all however:

PROS:
*Nice minifigs (accept for the super battle droids with hollow backs)
*A big set probably good value if you can afford it

CONS:
*The gun turrets on the side, they should be able to move up and down aswell
*The super battle droids, WHY ARE THEY HOLLOW!?


THE BIGGEST FLAW:
4 clone troopers!? You need 2 to pilot the ship, 2 to control the gun turret and if you customize the wing turrets you need anther 2 clones. So bassically we need at least 6 clones, and why not turn the ordinary clone that pilot the ship in to the pilots in the film, they managed a different storm trooper in the AT-AT, and where the heck are the ARC's?

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-28T20:10:45Z","Big Boy","  This set is very, very, very, very, very good! It is just packed with the best details not even displayed in the movie, it has a humongous amount of pieces for an aircraft, it comes with clone troopers and blasters, and it is huge! It took a while to build but it has some awesome pieces and canopies never seen in other sets. the clones are very neat, they look so good lined up with blasters. The set is divided up into seperate parts to build, making finding pieces a no-brainer! You need to be a pretty dedicated builder to construct this, but even some dummies out there could do it!  It is awfully heavy (It is so compact with bricks) and has some interesting colors. The controls are neat and it even has a compartment in the large nose that seats a large &quot;prison cell&quot; that is attached by a magnet- wickedly neat! 
   The front guns have a cool connection and the payload guns (The ones with the large domes as guarders) can retract into the width of the payload bay! Actually, the engine or fuel tank supplyer can be seen if you lift up a flap. There are tubes and a clear, translucent brick to act as the ventral fuel tank.  the 2 clonies man the controls of the ship while 2 more clonies operate the side guns with the domes. There is a gun in the back to, to wipe out those stupid droid starfighters who think they can attack from the &quot;unseen&quot; end. This is a rockin' set and I will gladly beg you to get it. It is large, big for the little shrimp to carry, but for us big boys, it is mighty fine!  A defanite enjoyable project for the uncommon builder! A homerun 10.

"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-06-22T15:31:42.763Z","Slightly Less Than Perfect","The box for this set is very attractive. It's big, and has all the nice display features on the back of the box. It looks to be a very promising buy. 

The set comes with great minifigs. Two super battle droids (only available in this set at the time) a droideka, and an exclusive (this set only, at the time) jedi figure. It also comes with four clone minifigures.

The building of this set is incredibly fun. It's great to dump out all the pieces, and start putting them together into what looks like nothing, but soon becomes obviously known what it's meant for. The building took me a night and a morning, although that's with me holding off on the building sometimes. 

The set has great features. It has retractable panels near the back to reveal weaponry, and a little console for a minifigure clone to sit at. It also has a magnet that picks up a toolbox to store in the front of the ship, and a hatch that displays the engine, amongst other nifty features.

Once the set is all put together, you are given two options. Do I play with the set? Do I display the set? This particular kit can be meant for both. The problem comes with playing. The set is a bit too fragile. Picking it up just over the midsection (the easiest sections) often results on the top part of the ship coming loose, and breaking. The other fragility issue is with the two front and back guns. The ends like to fall off all the time, and you're left with three round stubs. Currently how mine is. The two larger guns coming off the engines are also prone to snapping. 

It's better that you display the set, because it does great a nice display. Especially if placed center stage in your room.

I wanted to give this set a five, but the fragility caused the rating to drop to a four. It would be interesting to see the set redone, but until then, this a great addition to any Lego Star Wars collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I love the old clone troopers, especially the helmets.  The old Super Battle Droids are awsome too.  I love the light blue color on them much more than the dark blue which appear in Droids Battle Pack.  I also think it's cool how lego made two seperate cockpits on the top of the ship and two circular blaster cockpits at the bottom.  My only complaint is that there's no Yoda.  This definately isn't accurate to the movie because Yoda is the one who comes with the clones in the gunship to rescue the Jedi.  The other thing I should mention is that it's a little pricy.  I got it for $100(USD) when it was avalable in the stores.  Now you can't really get it cheaper than $150(USD).  But save up, this one is definately worth buying. 5/5  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"joelmama29","2010-01-23T15:01:04.67Z","ATTACK of the CLONES! ","I got the new Republic Attack Gunship and I feel in love with that set. But every time I look at pics of the this set on Brickset I just feel in love the turrets on the side of the ship just like the movie. So I had to have this set, I was able to buy a used one at a good price since they are selling like gold on Ebay and Amazon. But enough of that lets start this review. 

I love the Mini Figs except the Destroyer Droid! The original clone trooper have awesome helmets you cannot get those with the newer sets . The helmets have printed black instead of it being carved out. The Super Battle Droids are a metallic blue, and I know everyone complains and say they should be grey. But that blue makes them different and rare. But the one mini fig that stands out is the Jedi you get the set. It is unknown Jedi no name never seen in the movie. Who is he? Well if you look up this mini fig in the Star Wars Visual Dictionary it says he may be Jedi Bob! If this is Jedi Bob that is kinda cool if you ask me. 

The ship itself is not as big or beefy as the Republic Attack Gunship, but it has more detail in the inside. One thing that I love about the older sets is the printed pieces. I love how the front of the ship opens to reveal the controls in the inside of the ship. This does add extra playablility to this set. Also it comes with a Storage container inside which holds a tool kit for the Clone Troopers. And of course I have to say I love the Gun Turrets and how the Clone Troopers can actually sit and hold the controls just like the movie. Another feature that stands out on this set is how you can open the top of the ship to reveal the engine. Little things like this make the set stand out and more appealing to collectors. 

But there are some not so great features on this ship that I must point out. First is the guns in front of the ship, everyone is right on this they keep falling off. The second annoying thing is the stickers, this set for some reason has the worst stickers they do not last they begin to peel and crack over time. The final annoying thing is the Destroyer Droid pretty lame and not appealing. 

So in conclusion if you have the chance to pickup this set, you should get for collecting, investment, or just for fun! 

Pros: 
- Mini Figs 
- Several Clone Troopers 
-  Jedi Bob 
-  Rare Blue Super Battle Droids 
-  Detailed and Printed Pieces inside the Ship 
-  Turrets on the side of the ship

Cons:
-  Destroyer Droid
-  Stickers
-  Front guns keep falling off 
-  Very pricey on Ebay and Amazon ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Here are the Pros
Great episode 2 clones
Nice blue super battle droids
Weird jedi dude.
Awesome ball turrets on the side.
Awesome hyperdrive.

Cons
Lame Droidika
The front guns come off
Wing turrets are just hollow. No place for troopers to sit like the new one.
Stickers crack and peek off. :P

In conclusion, this is a nice set. It's good, wait. Make that great for the figures! It's also good for collector reasons. So if you have the new one, you can brag to your friends and say, ""I have BOTH Republic Gunships! What do YOU have??""

I say that it's a good set. Not great. But I would give it a 5. Because in 2002, this was a top of the line set. I got mine for 40 bucks (USD) on ebay. And spent another 20+ on the figures. But it was worth it.

This set also has a fun build. I really enjoyed it. And it's cool how the front opens up to show the tools and computers. I think that's just cool. And it's great for stop motion videos. 

Another good thing, it's great for a republic vs. seps battle. So tons of fun in this set. So you can reenact episode 2 on geonosis, almost any clone wars battle, or EVEN good for an Order 66 scene. This is just a great set!! I recommend you get it.

Here is some advice, 
1, it doesn't matter if it's sealed or not. Just as long as it's complete.
2, if a piece or 2 are brown that should be white, so what! That's just a couple pieces!
3, make sure you have a fairly large budget.
4, Make sure you really want it. If you don't. You just wasted quite a bit of money.

I got this for Christmas years ago when I was a youngster. The box was larger than me back then and I was blown away by the size. The set to me is better than the newer 7676 version because this one, not from the clone wars, has the bubbles on the sides that can configure in different positions to look like the one from Episode II, Attack of the Clones. This set doesn't have the flaps on the side that open up like the newer one, but that doesn't take away from it's coolness. The front actually opens up into two sections on either side and has a magnet that attaches to a box with equipment. There is a gun rack at the back of the ship for the clones. I am glad four clones were given in this kit along with a jedi. The droids were a nice touch as well. The cockpit opens upward so one can open the front easily. The back has a turret that can be manipulated to move in different directions like the front two guns. The ship itself is sturdy for its size and weight. I am surprised by its size for nearly seven hundred pieces. The build was long and tedious and I think the bags were numbered. Besides that, the ship is a great display model and fun to fly with for movies. I recommend this model for all of what it offers: pieces, figures, and display. The instructions are thick and are easy to follow. The set is still around at bricklink but the price may be high. Both gunships are great, but this one just beats the newer one for me.

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2013-12-30T17:00:36.707Z","Good-looking, but flimsy and limited","I never owned this set, though I very much wanted to. I have, however, replicated it to the instructions with the bricks I have, getting fairly close.<br><br>The Republic Gunship was released in 2002. It includes five regular minifigures (4 Clone troopers, one generic Jedi), two Super Battle Droids, and an original System-scale Droideka. The gunship is built in sections, which is okay for the angle of the cockpit and the play features inside the front, but one other section joint causes problems later. It was designed as something of an army-builder set, hence no specific characters.<br><br>The cockpit uses Technic axle-pin adapters and some ratchet-hinged ""landing leg"" type pieces to be mounted at an angle, a nice touch, doing the job better than building it with stepped plates and sloped bricks would, and freeing up the rest of the front end to open up. The rest of the front end splits, and opens on horizontal ratchet hinges for play access. There is a magnet-holding piece that hasn't seen much use since M-Tron (which I believe it was created for), which holds a compact med-unit chamber for med-evaccing critically injured. A very nice touch, and a sensible design feature for a military troop transport.<br><br>The main troop compartment section is where the set's design starts showing weakness. The use of 8x8 grate pieces rather than 8x8 plate pieces means that less of the floor is useful for standing on, and using alternating 2x3 inverted slopes and 1x2 bricks to hold the outside floor level is a bit weaker. The outside floor level is also flawed. 4x4 plates with only one row of studs were used, the thought being to not impede the movement of the doors or the retracting of the ball turrets, but this was overcompensation and is less strong than using 4x12 plates would have been. At the back, we have bricks for holding the troopers' guns (the layout here is really only compatible with the old megaphone-with-stud and camera-with-stud blasters, just a warning).<br><br>The upper back where the wings attach is a separate section from the troop compartment, and the joint between them is the set's Achilles Heel. They join mainly by bricks on the troop compartment with Technic pins on top plugging into the upper back.<br>This was a very, very, very, very extremely thoroughly STUPID idea. Stupid stupid stupid.<br>Because of this fact in the design, if you don't grip it by the underside of the troop compartment's connector -which is bloody difficult to do- the darn thing comes apart very easily. That, my friends, is a big design flaw. This hurts the playability greatly.<br><br>A lesser, but not entirely minor, flaw is that the set doesn't use the ball-jointed laser mount piece despite it being around (and being used in the AT-TE from the same line!), limiting the ability of the guns to be aimed considerably.<br><br>Minor complaints are that the clone troopers' guns should have transparent blue studs instead of transparent orange studs, and the lack of an additional hinge in either side-ball turret to let them aim down without tilting the window away from the seat.<br>",TRUE,3,5,4,2,3
