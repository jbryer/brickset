What I hate about this set is the pieces are still way too juniorised and all those technic pieces are a pain.  It's also perhaps rather expensive for a moderate sized spaceship, especially when the pieces still aren't very versatile or compatible with other sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The good:
-Ample interior space

-crappy controls in the cockpit, looks more like an electrical circut than anything else.

The Emporer is nice and I like the Imperial pilot, who is identical to the Imperial Officer exept the black suit. The shuttle is large but the cockpit isnt closed.  I really like the storage or passanger area. The Royal guards are awesome. I like it that the wings can fold up like the real thing and that the cockpit canopy rocks! It uses some nice &quot;evil&quot; colors and the main fin is large and sturdy. The wings are large and look fine and it isnt so completely hard to carry.

"8alchemist8","2008-02-02T01:32:46.543Z","A favorite ship - but lacking","OVERALL IMPRESSION:  The imperial shuttle (7166) set depicts one of the Star Wars fan’s perennial favorite ships.  It continually ranks among the favorite movie ship designs despite its minor role in the movie.  I think its association with the ominous presence of the Galactic Emperor Palpatine was crucial to this popularity.  He was menacing and mysterious, and his ship is accorded the same stigma.  The design of the ship, with it’s downward sloping cockpit, swooping wings and tall tail present a menacing character.

APPEARANCE:  That said, the feel and proportions of the ship from the film is well depicted in this Lego kit.  The lengths of the tail, wings and cockpit are balanced, its somewhat boxy main fuselage is nicely disguised with a four “engine” cylinders and the coloration of predominantly white with light gray and dark gray accents is balanced.  Four Transparent Light Blue vent tiles constitute the entirety of this feature.  Not exactly indicative of a high performance Imperial ship.

PLAYABILITY:  The ship does have good visual swoopability, however, as you will find out, it’s not advised to actually swoop it.  Oh, you’ll want to, but be prepared for flying parts and some flopping.  Another disappointment is the “engine exhausts”.  

The ship is a bit fragile and delicate in build.  The cockpit is anchored to the fuselage by two click hinge bricks as are each wing.  The result is the dreaded “floppywing” and “bobbing cockpit”.  I’ve also found that the cockpit likes to detach at inconvenient times.   Evidently, that massive dorsal tail will become a projectile, attached only by 8 studs.  So, this set has little practical swoopability.  It’s best performance is, perhaps, a graceful descent to the royal landing pad.  So, assuming you’re more interested in just landing the ship and recreating the pomp and pageantry of Emperor Palpatine’s arrival at the deathstar, will the ruler of the evil Galactic Empire be heralded with all the awesome dread he so deserves?  Not really.  He arrives via the rear stowage area on what appears to be a cargo pallet!  Not even a holder for his meager staff.  His intimidating guards get to accompany him on the cramped pallet.  At least THEY have holders for their spears.  The rear cargo hatch also doubles as the engine exhausts, indicating that His Majesty must endure the indignity of a ride in the engine compartment!  

BUILDABILITY:  The build-up is of low difficulty.  As is typical of the first issue Star Wars kits, the overall structure is very strait forward and every opportunity was taken to get the most perceived volume from a minimum of bricks.  The cockpit and cargo holds are not “airtight” having openings galore.  There are no complicated sub-structures and minimal use of Technic elements, to a disadvantage.  This simplified approach is responsible for the floppy wings and cockpit.  Detail pieces are sparse.  One can’t help but think this design was “pushed out to market”, and that like many other first issue sets, it would be worthy of a thorough redesign like the X-wing, Y-wing and Slave I to create a more robust toy someday in the future.  Unfortunately the re-release of this set (Imperial Inspection 7264) includes the SAME EXACT SHIP, but adds a bunch of ground support structures and additional mini figures.

VERSATILITY:  Unfortunately in many respects this ship is a typical first issue Star Wars theme set.  That is a good thing AND a bad thing.  The good is that there are plenty of plain bricks and plates, broadening options for alternative building.  The few special pieces that are included are the sort that I would classify as generally useful “space craft elements” such as a large windscreen, four engine cylinders and a couple of parts with circuitry / mechanical details that are NOT stickers and a few of those 1x1x2 vent sided bricks.  This makes this set a worthwhile shipbuilder’s brick bulking set.  

PRACTICALITY:  As is the case with most of these first issue Star Wars kits, it is disappointingly small.  One only has to watch this ship’s brief appearance in Star Wars Episode III to see that the ship was much more substantial in scale.  However, parking it next to the Imperial Landing Craft (set 7659) it is in reasonable scale agreement, so feel free to stage planetary raids with no worry that your ships look disproportionate.   Detracting slightly from the set is the sneaking in of a couple of odd colored bricks.  Luckily there were only a smattering of greens and blues – no yellow or red – which would clash terribly with the utilitarian white and grays.  Luckily these odd colored bricks are adequately buried in the structure so as to not be visible on the completed ship.  

The LITTLE PEOPLE: As mentioned, the manner of the Emperor’s quarters in the ship is a disappointment.  It’s a cramped little space not at all adequate for the most powerful Sith in the known galaxy.  Occupants for this shuttle appear to have been an afterthought.  The pilot is trapped alone, with only a circuit board to occupy his mind, while the Emperor and his elite guards are sitting Indian style on a load pallet in the engine compartment!  It’s disgraceful! 

The mini figures are a major draw to this kit.  If you are looking to put together an entourage for The Emperor, this is the more affordable way to do it.  The Imperial Guards, complete with their red bullet helmets and red capes are nicely done.  They are menacing in appearance and easily recognizable from the movies.  The Emperor is splendid.  His face has the wrinkles and sallow eyes that make him recognizable a the decrepit despot!  While I prefer the gray-faced version of this fig, “yellow faced Palpatine” is fine.  The pilot figure is a bit unremarkable, almost mistakable for some sort of mall security guard.  He is also smiling.  I guess if I was hauling the most powerful person in the galaxy wedged in my engine compartment with two of his peons, I’d have a smile on my face too.  I would think his Majesty would require a more professional demeanor from his servants.

In summary, this set has all the usual misgivings of a first issue Star Wars set – overly simplified, full of holes, too small and a bit flimsy.  It is, however, one of the more attractive ships, well proportioned, and includes some sought after mini figures.  I would hope that someday the Lego Group would see fit to do an UCS version of this set akin to the Falcon.  It deserves better.

"AFOSL","2009-09-21T01:55:18.827Z","Iconic Work Horse","One of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy and universe is the wonderful and memorable designs used in all the ship, vehicle, and building designs.  None of it could really be called generic with all the peculiar designs adopted for craft like the Millennium Falcon, Slave 1, B-Wings, Sail Barges, and AT-AT.  It can be said that very little design in the original trilogy resembles anything that was Earth-like.  Yet it was all instantly recognizable, especially to a fan.<br>The Imperial Shuttle introduced in Return Of The Jedi, is one of those instantly recognizable and well loved iconic designs.<br><br>Released in the 2001 line up, the Lego shuttle does it's best to emulate the design of the original, despite being out of scale and having a very limited selection of bricks used in it's construction.<br>Like all other Star Wars kits before it, the manual starts with the assembly of the minifigures.  Here we are offered a very generic pilot figure in black uniform and cap, the emperor Palpatine, with unique printed face, black tunic, cape, hood and a cane.  This figure first appeared in 2000 in set 3340, later appearing in the Imperial Shuttle, and then in 2002 in set 7200, Final Duel.  The version of the emperor in all these sets has a yellow face and hands. After the introduction of 'Fleshies' in 2003, the emperor figure was redesigned with a more true to life grey face and hands, released with 7264 Imperial Inspection, in 2006.  7264 was a slightly more elaborate re-release of this set.<br>Imperial Shuttle also includes the Royal Guard, resplendent in an overall red livery with a new mould for the helmet, a cape and spear/staff.  Two are included in this set.  The Royal Guard figure is among one of the rarer figures, having only been released in two other sets so far.  A slightly different version was also released with the expensive Death Star, set 10188.  The guards in this set had black hands instead of red featured in previous sets.<br><br>Construction of the shuttle begins with the assembly of the main fuselage.  Assembly of the fuselage is spread over 21 stages and 17 pages, and what you have at the end is a rather bulky looking box that really doesn't look like much, let alone the makings of a State vehicle.  Despite the shuttle having an over all colour palette consisting mostly of white, greys and tan, the internal construction of the fuselage utilizes plenty of bright blue and green bricks.  These are hidden quite well by the time construction of this stage is over so don't worry, your model will not look odd.<br>The fuselage has a flap on the back that opens to reveal a compartment which will eventually contain a sled, built in the next section of the manual.  The sled is made from only twelve parts, two of which are actually the spears used by the red guard figures.  The sled is a seating area for the emperor and his guards and it simply slides into place inside the fuselage, via the rear flap.  It's a bit of a tight fit when the figures are in place, and hardly a way for a dignitary to travel. <br><br>Construction continues with the front of the craft; the cockpit.  This is another bulky looking construction but it is solid, having two main pieces - chassis and canopy, and using plenty of smaller pieces to fill in the gaps and add a little detail.  Unlike the fuselage, the cockpit doesn't use bright colours for it's make up.<br>The canopy piece is a printed piece of slightly tinted clear plastic.  The print isn't as white as the rest of the white bricks and so looks a little odd.  It's more dirty white/light grey, almost as if it's taken some damage, if you can imagine that.<br>The cockpit attaches to the fuselage with two click hinges.  These allow the cockpit to fall into the correct position, giving the shuttle it's distinctive nose down appearance.<br><br>By now some of the more picky builders will notice that the cockpit only holds one figure instead of a half dozen a real shuttle could hold.  At this scale though, there are a lot of inaccuracies with the Lego Imperial Shuttle.  Most of these inaccuracies are largely internal or detail based, as from the outside the overall shape of the shuttle is almost spot on with it's movie counterpart.  I think this is what Lego were aiming for, mostly.  A true to scale shuttle would have to be of mammoth proportions, a UCS model along the lines of the Millennium Falcon, 10179. <br>At this point I could mention that I reckon the Imperial Shuttle is due a make over from Lego.  This original is great, in my own opinion, but I'm sure something better can be made, something that will truly do justice to the Shuttle design.<br><br>Once the cockpit has been finished, construction moves on to the wings of the craft.  These are fairly simple in design, mostly using plates in their construction.  The use of some small Technic elements help give the wings their distinctive shape, and like the cockpit, a couple of click hinges attach the wings to the fuselage and allow the wings to be moved into their landed or flight positions.<br>A translucent yellow stud at the tip of each wing completes that authentic look.<br>The dorsal wing is created from a good handful of assorted bricks and slopes in three colours; white, light grey and dark grey.  The dorsal wing and all the bricks that make it are all only one stud wide.<br>This wing is the weak point of the model and limits the swoosh factor.  One false move and this wing will fly off and smash to the ground.  Picking the model up by this wing is also not advised.  <br><br>Apart from the obvious flaws in design inherently brought about by the scale of the model, the design does work.  It's a little cumbersome to handle, and can be fragile if mishandled, but as a display piece it looks good.  The shape is almost true to that of the movie version, making it recognizable at first sight.  I think this is the most important aspect here.  Like a lot of the early Lego Star Wars models, the designs were not quite up to the standards now set by latter models.  From the X-Wing to the B-Wing, Slave 1 to Vader's Advanced Tie Fighter, all of these were flawed designs upon their first release.  The colours were wrong, the scale was off, the size wasn't correct, something wobbled way too much.  Yet all these early designs were recognizable as the craft they were trying to emulate, and all of these craft have been redesigned and re-released using Lego's new range of bricks and colours.<br>Maybe the Imperial Shuttle, as great as it is, will get the upgrade treatment it surely deserves.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,5

The biggest drawback is the poor interior: both the cockpit and the cargo/passenger bay are quite bare and look average.
