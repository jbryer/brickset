Now that would be a nuisance for lego to have those made in clear, but I think it would be better than the tan anyways), but those are the only real drawbacks I find. This is one of the highest pieced LEGO System sets, with 894 pieces!!! It doesn't seem to have too many pieces, but it really does. All features are realistic, including the saws on Sebulba's pod, and why does almost everyone want more minifigs? This has only four real minifigs, but then there is R2-D2, three pit droids, Sebulba, and one more drawback, a few random pieces very slightly resembling Gasgano but you could hardly get a good view of him in the movie, so it doesn't matter. Ten figures. I can't quite remember what the starting gate looked like, but I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to make (unless it was giant, then you could use a table). The lift. That would make the price higher than it already was if TLC added one, and that might pose a challenge on your own, so forget it, unless you have the patients to figure out a good way for the platform to move up and down, and enough tan pieces at the ready to be used. I found my copy of this for 80 USD. Quite playable, though, unless you make a large contraption to hold all three pods at once (wouldn't be too hard) you can only fly two at a time. The pit doids seem a bit tall compared to the minifigs. This set is pretty true to the movie.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T15:26:45Z","Just some ideas... cool set too","Well, this set is awesome i think and i had an idea as to why the slats were tan... if u look at the box and the tan, it seems to go together, my idea was that since this happened in a desert area, the peices were tan so if u had a tan area to play in, it wouldnt pose so much of a bad look. And i think this was my favorite of the Epi 1 sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"sudorum","2008-01-28T16:27:12.187Z","A lego you can live without","This lego has issues. The racepods are pretty cool; they have chainsaws that pop out on the sides to ""eliminate"" competition. However, the pods' tan support beams are just too annoying to ignore. Also, the supports beneath the pods are weak and unstable. The three little robots are even worse. Their arms fall off at barely a touch. Gasganno's head is good, but he doesn't even come with a minifigure body! Basically, he's just a head on a stick. Sebulba isn't much better. He has no movement capabilities, and is essentially a petrified figure that you can't do anything with. Also, Shmi should have been included in this set. Then again, perhaps its better that she wasn't, because Lego would have devised some way to mess her up too.",FALSE,3,2,3,3,4
"Kiiranaux","2008-03-08T22:46:25.107Z","well...","As you can see from my sets, I am quite a collector, and have this, but...
while many star wars sets combine for scenes wonderfully, this just doesnt fit.

Pros: figures
very swooshable
great scenery, even better with Watto's Junkyard and Podracer bucket
beautiful, realistic ships

Cons: not much to make a scene with; Tatooine just isn't like Naboo or Hoth.

LEGO must've realy did their research!it even comes with some pit drods (the likness isn't too great) and small tool rack things i didn't see in the movie... this is definatly a great set for your LEGO Tatooine, and almost a must have for your LEGO star wars colletion! just wish it had more pod racers...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The pit droids also look like the movie.  The only thing is that it should have the big arch that there was in the movie and the platform should be raised.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CFL_fan777","2009-03-07T15:58:49.763Z","A Classic Episode 1 Set","This is one of the first lego sets ever made. The build is repetitive because the podraces are the same on both sides though. The figures included are jar jar binks, 3 different pit droids (different colors for each pilot), rd-d2, padme, gasgano, young anakin (needs shorter legs), sebulba and qui gon jinn. Making a total of 10 figures for the set. Anakin's podracer is a basic and fast build. Gasgano's podracer is probably the most fun out of all of the podraces. The colors are great (dark purple, orange and green) and the cockpit is great because it has just enough detail (head rest, etc). Gasgano the figure is made out of 8 peices (including helmet). His podracer has two saws hidden under black flaps on the out side of both motors. Subulba's podracer seems a bit over sized in comparison to the other lego sets. The orange color really looks great on display though. Sebulba the figure is only one piece. On the front of his podracer there are two saws that can flip out and the sides of the motors can open part way giving it some play-ability. The set includes 2 (fixing) stations and a extra flag for anakin.

It was also one of my first Star Wars sets, and even though it has long since been demolished, I might just have to build it again sometime in the future.<br><br>This set has some parts that i've only seen in this set, especially some of the rare colors and printed bricks. There is an infinite amount of playability in this set, along with some building techniques that were probably a little advanced for 1999.

"LegoCollector125","2011-08-07T05:57:02.76Z","Reinact the Boonta Eve Classic!","<p>I got&nbsp;the Mos Espa&nbsp;Podrace set many years after it's original release, and&nbsp;immiediately enjoyed the set.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The set is pacakged very interestingly. Like most sets, it has a large outer box with a picture of the set, etc. Inside the box are 3 smaller boxes, each with a picture of one of the podracers on them. Each vechicle is built from a separate box of pieces. The instructions are divided into sections to match the boxes. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set has an amazing assortment of unique parts in new colors and with new printings, many of which are unique to this set. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Not a bad selection of minifigures. We get the very common Qui-Gon, Jar Jar Binks, Padme Amidala, R2-D2, 3 brick built pit droids in colors corresponding to each podracer, Anakin(Podracer), Sebulba(who is a one piece mold figure), and a brick built Gasgano. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build of the set is very enjoyable, and uses several techniques I've never seen before. The effect of the podracer is achieved in several very interestign ways, and I enjoyed the build. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed set is an accurate representation of the podrace, with each pod's size and colors differing correctly. All of the pod's (particularly Sebulba's) have hidden features and weapons to increase playability. I find it a bit hard to play with the set, only because of it's massive size. I would have liked to see a better method of holding the podracers together than what is seen in this set, but it isn't all that bad. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, one of my favorite Episode I sets, recreating an incredible scene in&nbsp;the movie. It is a must have for an Episode I fan, but these days can be a bit hard to get. I'd suggest the new podracer if you are just looking for an Anakin and Sebulba, but personally, I feel the older version of this set far outshines the new one. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
