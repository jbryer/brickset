"A_Brickset_user","2000-04-24T00:00:00Z","","The B-Wing set is very cool yet could use just a bit more in the way of detail.  I would like to go out and buy smooth pieces to cover the wings just to see what it looks like then.  The cockpit swivels which was a nice detail and one they must have researched so it shows they put thought into this model.  Overall a good set and looks really neat on your desk with the other models.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2000-08-08T00:00:00Z","","Ewok of Evil?  Is there any other kind?
Anyhow, I LIKE this set!  It's not perfect (the set should be designed so that when it's on the ground the pod is on the right hand side, not the left), but overall its nicely done.  The weird storage area is kind of kewl, if you want to play smugglers, and I REALLY like having another R5-D4 (though it's an R2 unit, and not an R5), and the control center is REALLY nice.  I really recomend buying this set!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-27T15:54:40Z","Pretty Good Set","I'd say that this set is pretty good.

The good:
That base rules, I like the sliding wall, i just wish there
was another sliding door

I like the Death Star II Shield Generator Glass piece

I like the white chair, and i like the train-thing. I combined that and the X-wing train and made a nice little train

the ship is very good


The bad:
not enough minifigs",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-26T13:27:06Z","Beautiful Set!","      This set is nice but it is long discontinued!  The B-wing is not real at all! It is way to gimpy and skinny, but the pilot is cool, and so is the cockpit! It has good laser blaster details and looks nice. It is hard to land and is difficult to keep together. The good clear canopy is used as a plus factor. 
Rebel control center. This is nice, but it aint closed. It has some nice details and a nice glass thing that shows data. This set is nice if you can get your hands on one! The B-wing is nice but if you know me, I like the Empire better! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-13T02:30:12Z","I have 3 sets!","First of all, I E-Bayed and finally won three of this set in an auction. It was hard as the price for this set is usually over $60.00 which is double the Retail price. 

I am glad I have three of this set. Its a good design. The biggest problem though is the B-WING is supposed to be bigger then the Y Wing and the X-Wing. this set is smaller than the new 4502 X Wing and so its not accurate as far as shape and size is concerned. I think in the movie, the side that it lands on is opposite the side lego has it landing on currently. 

I will admit however I love having the ship in the Rebel arsenal. Its a surdy build for me and it holds up well, its just too damn small!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"david001","2007-03-31T09:45:47.74Z","Flimsy Wings","The original B-Wing model, this set is more flimsy than it's more modern counterpary (set # 6208).  The wings are not as reinforced as the more modern set; the cockpit seems smaller, and the missile tube acts as a cargo hold in this version.  The set also comes with the control centre rather than a docking bay.

That's not too say it's a bad model in it's own right: just don't be expecting it to take a lot of damage before falling apart!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-29T12:03:11.793Z","B-Wings aren't Bad","I remember getting this set and when I finished it, it looked so cool. I really like the command center with the sliding doors and the Death Star hologram piece. The B-Wing itself is also a fine piece of work. The rotating cockpit is very cool and useful in dogfights. Why are people saying this is bad, because this set is a great set overall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Noah1997","2009-09-14T08:18:55.95Z","Great B-wing","this set is great the rebel control center is cool but the B-wing is the best the cockpit at the
top wouldn't stay in one place so I fixed it with some of my pieces the rebel control center 
guy is pretty cool this set you can play with for a long time and it will still be fun I would get it if I were you its pretty cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2009-01-31T10:11:59.687Z","Such a classic!","With 338 pieces in this set, it was $29.99. Not a bad price, you would think at first. But when you hear 3-minifigs in it, you have to get it. This was the original B-Wing fighter and the simpler one. But this set includes a rebel base, a B-wing pilot, r4-d5, a rebel technician, a robot arm, and a tool tray! This was a genius set by Lego because the rebel base was built well and detailed. The black doors on the base slide open and you have a screen and a computer board in it! You can also slide r4-d5 in the B-wing by a little door on the side! Pretty cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-25T13:05:14.23Z","Decent, but still some flaws.","The best thing I like about this set is how it not only comes with a fighter but a base and maintenance vehicle. However, the B-Wing has problems concerning the blocky pieces used, which does take away some appeal and have you asking ""How come something is missing?"". In my opinion sleeker pieces give the fighter that much more detail. It's a good thing they remade all the classic fighters.

Pros:

-B-Wing is fairly realistic
-Wings are adjuastable
-Cockpit can rotate
-Cockpit window opens to put pilot inside
-Cannons and engine looks pretty cool
-Rebel Command Base included
-Base is hinged
-Base has sliding doors, a control panel, and a screen showing the Death Star 
-Comes with maintenance vehicle with tools
-Pilot, mechanic and astromech droid included

Cons:

-B-Wing is kind of blocky, a common problem other early Star Wars fighters shared
-B-Wing's engine does not open and close in the real thing! 

Overall good set but I strongly recommend the newer B-Wing with the more realistic, sleeker design . Although it doesn't come with a base it has a docking tower.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JVbadger","2008-10-17T01:08:44.67Z","Charming, but flawed.","*Warning: the following review may be blurred by nostalgia*
Well, the box shows the B-Wing flying, with a handyman and astromech standing near the base.

Construction: Very layered, stacking pieces upon pieces. Not very technic. Cockpit is fun! Rebel base is very enjoyable to build, as is the handyman's repair...thingy.

Pieces: Three figs. The Rebel pilot has a nice helmet. Handyman has a unique face.Ton of accessory parts! Binoculars, retro walky-talky, screwdriver, drill, oil can, socket wrench, wrench and hammer. Cockpit and the crown jewel...Death star plans hologram!

Playability: No wonder the B-Wing is at the garage. flimsy wings and cockpit. The hanger works well, with Handyman working hard on the busted B-Wing. I really like the hanger. Sliding doors!

Compatibility: Doesn't work well in a fleet of newer ships. The hanger can be added to other rebel bases well though.

All in all, if you want a B-Wing get a newer one, but buy this for the hanger. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
