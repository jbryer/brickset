The Model Team range is good, but poorly supported in my opinion and hasn't really moved on since its concept. The Tie (and X-Wing) offer a sense of 'realism' that rivals more conventional model making. I was amazed at the sheer scale of this model, and its accuracy of scale too, all acheived with bog standard pieces. My only moan would be that it can be slightly fragile and definitely isn't a model that you would buy a ten year old. This is Lego built with adults in mind and is a thing of beauty. It should probably have the a warning on it - KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-03-15T00:00:00Z","","Lovely set with excellent detail. The wings can be adjusted from the position shown on the box picture to fully flat, the cockpit interior is nicely detailed, and the blue / black / dark grey colour scheme looks great! The only flaw is the cockpit canopy which tends to fall off when you try to open it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-18T00:00:00Z","","I also think this is better than the giant X-Wing. The attention to detail is good everywhere except the guns, they could have had more putthoughtintoitism. I only say this 'cause I saw blown up pictures of this whole thing, and specials on the guns, and they looked different. But still, differnt piece designs are limited, and TLC did a very good job. Obviously, the price hinders most everyone except ultra Star Wars completists and people who like detailde models from buying this, but if you have the money, and you like the model, get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Highly detailed and good use of color. The cockpit opens and displays a detailed interior. Altough not as large as the X-Wing, it's much easier to build and is major eye candy side-by-side the X-Wing. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Deinonychus","2007-12-15T16:10:14.577Z","&quot;I made a few special modifications myself...&quot;","I finally picked this set up after a seven ear delay and I have to say it was a near crime for me to have waited so long. 

This set is pretty simple and has a low piece count as far as UCS sets go, and because of that, its price tag (original and current selling price on ebay/bricklink)is very steep considering what you get. All that being said, once assembled it is a gorgeous ship and an integral part to any Star Wars LEGO collection. Construction is sturdy and well conceived, and the fact that it only has stickers for the display plate will please a lot of people. 

The Interceptor comes with the usual LEGO TIE styling which consists of lots of blue. While this just fine for me personally for the Minifig-scale ships, when the Interceptor is placed next to the UCS Vader's x1 Advanced Prototype, it looks a little awkward. Fortunately, it is relatively easy and inexpensive to swap out the blue pieces for dark gray and bring the ship a little more in-line with the other TIE. With the original blue, the Interceptor is gorgeous. With dark gray modifications, its simply stunning. 

If you can afford it, do yourself a favor and acquire one of these sets,you won't regret it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
