"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T12:18:13Z","Very neat model!!","         I always loved these babies from the movie. I also like battle droids, so this is a very nice &quot;upper&quot; set. It is very large and consists of very thick armor. It has twin blaster cannons up front and the cargo bay blast doors open up to reveal the folded up battalion of battle droids! They all have blaster rifles and other makes too. This set is very large but has some very cool pieces. It is a tad bit heavy and some of the armor pieces fall of. It comes with about 7 or 8 battle droids which all can fold up and be transported. This set doesnt have stationary landing gear but another great pointer is the side doors that flip open so you can see the innards of the ship!  This is a very neat set and if you can get an AAT, STAPs, gungan grand army, flash speeder, droid fighter, and Naboo Starfighter, you can have the battle for Naboo with great detail! This is a very good Star Wars collectors gimme and it is long discontinued, but I swear you can find one on bricklink or ebay!  A happy 9!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-21T16:56:42Z","Great Set!!!!","This set is wicked cool!!! I think it needs a few more Battle Droids to carry in the MTT. The MTT has graet details. It's a good size too. The last thing you need is a is a Destroyer Droid to go with the Battle Droids!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T19:59:32Z","Battle droid balooza!","This set is great mostly because of the battle droids.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-03T00:13:52Z","This set sucks &quot;ronto bits&quot;. Period. End of story. ","I bought this in 2000, because it was on sale, and I thought it would look good next to the rest of my SW sets.  I was wrong.  This set was constructed using only &quot;system&quot; bricks, giving it an unduly boxy appearance that is absent from later, Episode II and III sets.  Its forward laser cannons are innacurate, since the Ep. I cannnons were semi-spherical in appearance, like the ones seen on the AT-TE, et. al.  The huge brown hatches that open into the droid storage area and cockpit are extremely flimsy, and break off at the slightest touch.  The high point of the set is the # of battle droids...but, as many other sets have demonstrated (Mos eisley cantina, anyone?) cool figs don't compensate for lame design.  Maybe if the set was reissued today with new, curvy bricks to better represent the craft shown in the movie it would be better.If you have the MTT, sell it...it has appreciated to 75 USD or so.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-24T05:18:54Z","It's a nice set but not the best to get the figs.","It looks a lot like the one in the movie,the colour should have been all brown and the droid that drives it should be blue.This set is better than the droid carrier if you like to play with your legos or set them up,but if your only buying sets to get the figs get the droid carrier.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-18T17:03:29.577Z","nothing special","this isnt the greatest set and is quite flimsy. it doesnt exactyly have a whole bunch of droids compared to the 2007 one but it does have room indside and a realalistic loading/unloading mechanism. the reason i didnt rate this higher is because it has a pitiful amount of droids, a slightly weird color scheme and is quite flimsy.

"Leggodt94","2009-08-21T13:49:40.123Z","The Biggy!","Before every great remake there is a great original! Setting the pace for my favorite lego set of all time, the 7184 Trade Federation MTT is a wonderfully classic set that really captures the earlier design of when lego star wars first came to be. This set has great features like the opening front door to reveal the droid rack, opening doors on the side to reveal the cockpit, an opening door in the back to reveal extra cargo room, and opening flaps on the side to reveal hidden turret guns. The model can also come apart into two smaller pieces, one being like a command post with relay signal computer pieces. Along with a minifig count of SEVEN battle droids makes this set a one of a kind. 

Another thing that I would like to add though is that this set really isn't appreciated as much as it should be simply because of the newer version. I mean, of course the newer version's gona have more features otherwise it wouldn't be newer. You shouldn't down this set just because there is a newer version. I mean, I like the 7662 more than this one, but I don't absolutely hate this set. I like them both, and I think that both are fantastic sets. They both have something to add to the lego star wars universe.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

it doesnt hold together well
not enough droids

I got it when I was about 6-7. Sadly,
I never saw the finished product. Even 
though my brother, Mom, and 2 friends helped
me build it. The directions were kinda 
complicated, However I believe this set is
downright cool. I will never forget those
droids.

"HQuiff","2009-03-09T15:32:59.497Z","A Prodigy To Star Wars!","My older brother got this for his birthday and believe me, it was one of the most incredible sets ever! Firstly, the back can come out and fold and open into a base with computers and stuff! There's a back door to that can open too. The droids are a great army builder, maybe one or two more though. :)
The doors beside the drivers room can open, and the front open to reveal a droid carrier with deactivated droids. Color scheme and likeness to the movie are great as well to add to the praise.  
Pros:
1. Seven droids! Great army build (As already mentioned)
2. Nice front blaster guns.
3. At the back of it near the side you can open shutters to reveal turrets!
4. Opening doors to the cabin.
5. Can fold out into a great base.
6. Front can open and carrier can come out.
7. Exclusive pieces!
Cons""
1. Maybe the color of the guns and blasters.
2. Nothing else to add! :)
Overall this set scores at least 9/10!
Keep up the good work Lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Taggerung1","2013-12-04T20:03:36.413Z","Fantastic for its time, still a great set!","<h4>Review:<br></h4>I've had this set since it first came out, and I just recently bought the newer version (7662), and I've been comparing the two closely.&nbsp; I have to say the new one is better, but for a set way back in 2000, this thing was the best it could be.<br><br>Playability is an important factor for any Lego set, and I can remember 11 year old me having hours of fun with this set.&nbsp; It was everything.&nbsp; A troop carrier with enough battle droids to take over the whole bedroom.&nbsp; A battering ram strong enough to smash through any building.&nbsp; And even a mobile command base and cargo transport to boot!&nbsp; Not to mention, the opening panels and hinges and doors made it so that when my friends' shot it with a missile or threw a bomb inside, it would always explode so nicely.&nbsp; And I still love the way the back part comes off, and opens up into a command base.&nbsp; Lots of great memories in that thing, that's for sure.<br><br>Parts-wise, this set does not disappoint.&nbsp; There was a time when I didn't have the set built, but had mixed the pieces into my collection and used them in other things.&nbsp; It's got a lot of good pieces for building structures, as well as vehicles and such.&nbsp; Also, if you were short on brown before, you wouldn't be any more.&nbsp; Lots of dark grey as well, which is always cool.<br><br>On the minifigures, it comes with a total of 7 Battle Droids, one to pilot the vehicle, and 6 soldiers on that deployable rack.&nbsp; Combine that with the 7126 Droid Carrier, (another 6 droids and a pilot), and well...

"Scott1","2020-09-03T23:05:05.627Z","Lego's Very First MTT Attempt","<p>Released in 2000, this was Lego&#39;s first try&nbsp;at designing an MTT. And it&#39;s pretty obvious.&nbsp;Though it was a pretty good set when it was released, it has not aged very gracefully, and is far outshone by the 2007 MTT and even the 2014 version, which is almost universally regarded as a huge downgrade from the 2007 version.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to buy this set brand new, as I was too young. I never had the box or instructions, and since it was shipped already constructed, I didn&#39;t need them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>You get some rather different&nbsp;and strange colored pieces in this set, ones that you wouldn&#39;t expect in an MTT. There&#39;s green, the lighter tan color, and even some red. Most of them are on the inside, where you can&#39;t see them, but some can be seen from the outside, especially that green plate towards&nbsp;the rear.&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t look that good compared to the 2007 and 2014 versions. It&#39;s not the set&#39;s fault &mdash; that&#39;s just how Lego Star Wars was back then. It just goes to show how far Lego has come in 20 years.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigs in this set are just OK.&nbsp;7 battle droids would make a fine addition to anyone&#39;s droid army.&nbsp;It&#39;s always wonderful to just get a bunch of battle droids, which doesn&#39;t really happen anymore. Now they always throw&nbsp;in a named fig like Qui-Gon Jinn or&nbsp;Obi-Wan Kenobi, or both, like they did in the 2014 version. I&#39;ll admit, it makes more sense that way so kids can have someone to fight,&nbsp;but you can never go wrong with some&nbsp;battle droids. However, I do wish they included at least a specialized battle droid (commander, security, pilot, etc) or something else to sweeten the deal a little. For such a big set 7 feels a bit on the small side, and for what would be $80 today it feels like something&nbsp;(albeit minor) is&nbsp;missing&nbsp;from the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>Like I previously said, I wasn&#39;t able to build the set, as I received it already assembled.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playability</strong></h3>

<p>Playability is amazing for this set. I mean, what kid doesn&#39;t want to deploy a droid army? Plus, there&#39;s a ton of empty space at the back that you could put in whatever you wanted! Droidekas, STAPs, more droids, you name it. That&#39;s another thing Lego doesn&#39;t really do anymore, at least not in Star Wars; every nook and cranny is filled up by something. Again, it&#39;s way better now than it was before considering all the play features that can now be included, but I do miss the big empty spaces that allowed for so much freedom. There&#39;s also tons of opening hatches and flaps that let you access the inside.&nbsp;Lastly, the front half of the MTT can detach from the back and the rear portion can open up, like a portable command base. I have no doubts&nbsp;it was SUPER cool back in the day, and it&#39;s another feature that Lego Star Wars completely abandoned.&nbsp;BUT, the set is not without its drawbacks. And there are many, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The droid rack deploying&nbsp;action isn&#39;t the smoothest thing in the world; far from it, actually. To move the rack out, you have to manually open the front hatch and pull the rack itself out. The problem with this is that the rack (or the droids on it) can very easily get snagged somewhere along the inside and break. Because of the way this MTT is designed, with the rack being suspended in mid-air above a fairly large, inaccessible empty space,&nbsp;it&#39;s rather difficult to repair it without taking the whole thing apart. Speaking of the droid rack, the design of it is just not very good. I couldn&#39;t find a way to put the droids on the rack without using a (presumably) illegal technique AND without taking off two lance pieces going down the center of it. The way it&#39;s set up in the picture has the droids&#39; feet partly hanging off the rack, as they are being blocked by said two lance pieces. So I tried using the technique shown in the picture... and it still didn&#39;t work. I wasn&#39;t able to retract the rack fully back into the MTT because the entrance to the droid bay is too small. It works fine with an empty rack, but not with droids on them. I just removed the lance pieces and it works fine for the most part now, but it&#39;s frustrating when a set doesn&#39;t work as designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, the MTT itself is fairly fragile, as&nbsp;this set was made before technic frames were integrated into the larger vehicles of Star Wars. The worst offender in my eyes is the two gun pods on either side of the front. The way they&#39;re connected to the main body is very poor, and they can break off with the slightest touch. The way the side panels open up isn&#39;t the greatest of connections either, but it usually works. The way the MTT can split itself into two and open up further is surprisingly well-done, but it involves removing a few pieces on the top that can very easily be lost.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>

<p>The price of this set was $50.00 back in 2000. Adjusted for inflation, that&#39;s $76.75 in 2020 dollars. Looking back, it seems like a fairly average value. $76.75 for 470 pieces isn&#39;t a very good price to part ratio, but the bulkiness of the vehicle itself makes up for it in my opinion. 7 battle droids is OK for the price I suppose, but like I said it would&#39;ve been nice if they included a droideka, a STAP, a commander, a pilot, or even a security droid just to go that extra mile, which would have been greatly appreciated considering the set&#39;s numerous flaws.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of us are blinded by nostalgia for this set, as even if we didn&#39;t personally buy it new, it was the MTT featured in&nbsp;Lego Star Wars. But by 2020 standards, it doesn&#39;t look that great. The colors are pretty different from&nbsp;the real thing, and the proportions, especially towards the front end, are a bit off. That said, it IS a set from 2000 after all. They did the best they could, and this set will always be cool to those that played the original Lego Star Wars game,&nbsp;those that owned the set when it was new, and those that always wanted the set but never got it. But we can&#39;t let nostalgia and its rose-colored glasses blind us forever &mdash; this is Lego&#39;s first MTT rendition, and it shows.&nbsp;</p>
