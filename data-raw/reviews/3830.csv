PLUS 
*great parts
*Aldar Beeda is a nice minifig, so is Watto, but not AS nice

MINUS
*Where is Mawonic 
*Watto should be smaller though that not a huge problem

OVERALL
A nice set if you like Lego pods, a bit pricey but has nice parts.
Buy it if you LOVE the pods, if not, go for something else.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-30T17:32:25Z","Okay","It's good I only payed $20 for this at Wal-Mart on sale. If I payed full I would've probably had buyers-remorse. It should've came with Mawhonic and it would've been way cooler if there were more pods like Ody Mandrell and Ben Quadinaros- especially Ben Quadinaros!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T18:06:14Z","Watto sucks, but you get two awesome pods!","  This set is very nice. Aldar Beedo's pod racer looks the fastest of all of them with the giant engines and afterburners! Beedo's podracer comes complete and in sorts and you can include it in with other pods or in  you next lego race! Iove the engines of this pod. Watto minfigure sucks *&amp;%# just like the gamorrean one does, but the vehicles are enought o make this set a 9!  Th other pod is not completed but you can complte it with other pieces in the set! It has humongous engine intakes with nice stickers onit! Aldar Beedo is an odd minfig. You get some other afterthought things but it is defanitely a good set! I give it a 9 just for the two uncommon pod racers!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-12-12T01:01:08.717Z","Just for some extra parts","I forgot I had this one, probably because I never actually built it. It was a gift from my parents, who thought I would like all the different bricks used in this set. And they were right. The model itself was of no interest to me, and I quickly used the parts for other stuff. Plus it is the only Star Wars set I have, so it wouldn't have fit in if I had built it anyway.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Merissa","2011-08-09T04:35:36.97Z","A fantastic set, a really fantastic set!","This set is extremely rare, which is one reason it's so expensive and very hard to buy under a price of $200.00. I picked this set up off the very helpful website Bricklink.com for $235.00 AUD, and I can tell you I was simply gobsmacked when I opened the set. Not only is the set full of unique and rare element's, but there are printed piece's and exclusive mold's. As a Lady Adult Fan of LEGO, I can see a lot of people also enjoying this set as I did and still do. <br><br>1st thing that I would like to mention is this set is very, very high quality. On the side of the Box the set say's; Made in Denmark, Switzerland and U.S.A. I love when I see Quality Companies and non of that Chinese stuff, it make's the whole set more worth it for the fantastic quality. <br>&nbsp; One thing that I noticed is that the new LEGO Sebulba's and Anakin's Podracer set say's Made in Denmark, Hungary, China, Mexico and the Czech Republic. So Watto and Sebulba are definitely made in China and therefore are not the best Quality. That is why this Watto in this set is a lot better, because it's Quality look's utterly Phenomenal. Also there is something about the classcness of the old Watto that make's it so much better. <br><br>Mini-Figs:<br><br>Watto: Watto is a lot better than the new one. It has much more Quality and even though it doesn't have as much printing as the new one, I feel it doesn't need that to look amazing. The mold itself is outstanding, with such quality and precision that it is a work of art. Watto has a full Molded Head which attached to his cream torso and cyan blue leg's. He also has a lovely clear brick underneath him to resemble him floating. He also has a small printed control pad. This is the only set that contains this Watto Mini-Figure. <br><br>Aldar Beedo: At first I didn't like this Mini-Figure, however when I saw a real picture of the character it resembled it extensively, it looked 98% the same. It is a great Mini-Figure and it's very rare. He has a cream molded body with a little arm that can lean on the glass on his podracer, another great detail. <br><br>The Junkyard contains a small section for Watto with some tools and some arches resembling his little shack which is a nice detail and look's really cool. Aldar's Podracer is one of the finest peice of work that I have ever seen LEGO create it look's phenomenal!. The colours and the pieces are perfect! And everything's PRINTED! which is very rare. The Podracer is very rare and is an instant winner in my opinion. Excuse me for my lack of memory or knowledge but for now I'm going to refer the second podracer as the green podracer haha. The Green Podracer is a great addition as it give's the person the ability to create an entire new Podracer literally! So you get two in one! It's another great addition with heap's and I mean heap's of printed element's and unique pieces. <br><br>Believe me when I say this is in my top favourite LEGO set's! It is a great set! If you want a set full of High Quality, Printed Element's, Rare Mold's, Rare pieces and element's. This is the set, 10/10! Get it if you can, it is amazing! <br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
