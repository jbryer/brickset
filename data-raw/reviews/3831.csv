"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-28T04:20:40Z","Fun Set!","This set is just soooo fun to play with! Swooshable to no end and you can open it up and play in the interior of the Millennium Falcon!!! You also get 6, yes count them, 6 Star Wars minifigs. Nice details (for an early set, 1999) and many moving parts. OK, it's not an exact representation of the MF, but come on, it's a Lego!!!

Loads of fun and the interior is a blast!! The new MF coming out in 2004 may or may not have a MF interior, but just by looking at the pics, it doesn't look like it.  This set is a MUST HAVE, if only for the interior view of the MF!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-29T02:21:41Z","A Lego Millennium Falcon! What more do you want???","The most requested and best loved Star Wars vehicle, the Millennium Falcon set is just fantastic to build and is a blast to play with. When you get bored playing with the ship, you can open it up and play with the minifigs in the cool interior. There's hidden compartments, the &quot;chess&quot; table, an escape vehicle, and a cool cockpit. This set has over 650 pcs and is BIG! 

High playablility value and good details. And anyways, did I mention THIS IS THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!!!! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-07T11:24:24Z","This is how all Lego's should be!","I got this set a few years ago and to this day I still play with the thing. First of all, the ship itself looks great and is very sturdy. The colors do a nice job, with minor variations (blues and tan) for highlights. It's a bit on the heavy side but it's still manageable. However, the fun does not start until you take the top off and view the interior! There are a lot of details in this set: 3 hidden compartments, a seating area with a Dejarik Hologame Board, escape pod, cargo compartment, and a workable entry walkway. On top of that, there is plenty of room to add even more details. In addition, the set comes with 6 minifigs! Han, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO. It is fairly easy do modifications on this set to make it even more detailed! It's both a vehicle and a playset all in one! I just wish Lego would make more sets like this!

I can't say enough about this set. This is by far the most fun Lego I own, and I own a lot of sets! A definite MUST for any lego fan!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-10T15:08:35Z","Nice... very nice... v&#233;&#233;&#233;&#233;&#233;ry nice...  But it's not perfect","It is quite an investment, but you get something great in return: your own LEGO version of THE key ship of the Star Wars saga. Salesprices are quite steep, but then again it was quite hard to find (I got mine from Scotland, and only saw a single one in just ONE Dutch shop, ever!)

Comes with virtually all key characters from epIV, and with the nice design of the ship is a pure pleasure to own.  It has a perfect round shape, which is mostly due to the fact that the set uses the huge 'UFO' plates from a few years back.  This makes it 'look' nice, but it lacks a bit of essential LEGO (but hey, I'm an 'ol eighties LEGO fan) 

The cockpit is a bit of a wobbly feature, and I'm not sure I like the escape ship.  But what I really find a drawback is that there is so little room for the minifigs to 'stand' in the ship due to the spaceframe constructions of the roofpieces.  The minifigs really have little room to stand up, and every time you move them one stud, you can't close the Falcon anymore.  Something I hope they'll have sorted for the new Falcon

The set attracts the most attention from people who are not into Star Wars, and check out your collection.  Therefore thing central piece in your collection should be treated in a good way (which is rather logical, with the minifigs alone costing $50 a piece...)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-25T12:00:23Z","Impressive","This set is the one set I own that I constantly play with. There is sooooo much to do with this set. It's very easy to make modifications and add more details, which is what LEGO is all about. The exterior is limited in the kinds of mods you can do, but the interior is fantastic. The details of what is included has been covered in previous reviews so I won't get into that. Let's just say that you can restage any SW MF scene you want!

This has to be the most playable SW set out there!

It's nice to build and great to play with. My nephew and I spend a lot of time playing with it and trying to modify the landing gear which is not retractable. I think it's one of the problems. Also the escape pod is very dull and the interior could be divided instead of having one big area.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-01T15:36:44Z","New one looks totally better!!!!!","        This is a great set! I like the new one more and the only reason I gave this a slightly better rating than the new one is that the structure is sturdier. The new one kindof looks like a Millennium Falcon. Anything this big that you finish you will most likely like, but the cockpit is horrible. It isnt at all realistic and the new one looks completely better! The inside is okay but I still say that the new one prevails. The dome shaped roof might be a little more sharp from the movie but they have some downpointers. I like it that you get better figures in this one (With yellow heads). This one isnt as good as the new one but building it isnt as long and isnt as frustrating. This is a good set if you finish it but I would still pick the new one if you can make the modifications your self. This is a good set and get it if you find it! Harder every day!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-17T14:53:30Z","I like this set so much that I have decided to get one off Ebay.","I'm a teenage fan of Star Wars in the United Kingdom and it's fun to get the things you never had as a child. Now there is one thing I'm getting and it is in my own experience a great set. I was a preteen shopping at Toys 'R' Us with my nine year old brother Chris and my Dad when I first looked at that set and I thought &quot;Oh my god. That set's lovely.&quot; That when it gave me pause for thought. I want to get it, but my father would say &quot;Sorry Mike. That will cost us more than we bargained.&quot;
So I had no other choice but to let it go. I really could have wanted it. Honest. I'm not sure what's in my future, BUT, I repeat But I won't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever infininty let it be repeated my past dumb insolence. Anyway, I like this set because the characters I like from the Classic Trilogy are Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. I'm eager to get that set like I should have done a long time ago. But, I'm sure I can reverse and old wrong in my life. With Ebay! May the bricks be with you! Thanks for reading!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-18T16:01:14Z","I Finally got the set and ready to be mine in time for my birthday!","At last! I've got set No. 7190 off eBay! And it cost me a maximum bid of &#163;74.55. It will come to me for the first time in its original likeness to me on my birthday. On May 17th, my dad will build it up with me. I tell you what, It will be like a little father/son quality time together me and him. I even made a contract saying I will NOT break it up into bits. Anyhow, I'm raised in England and it's a nice model. And that's it. As Marvel Comics' Stan Lee said 'Nuff said!'",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-04T20:53:10Z","This set is very cool ","I got this set a few years ago for Christmas. This was probley my first real big lego set that I put togher. I might want to agree with the other peaple who said that the new one looks better but you should take into cocideration that this set came out about three or four years before the new one. When you think about that you can see that the old Millennium Falcon looks real good compared to the year that it came out.

pros  this set looks real cool and big



cons  I had a little problem with how that it was hard to put both Chewie and Han in the cocpit. The cocpit is also a little to tight to put two mini figures in it ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ZO6","2005-08-08T10:06:29Z","Impressive but could be better","-Set includes 659pieces and 6 minifigs.

At the time when this set came out it was overpriced but since its the Millenium Falcon I had to get it anyways.  

This set takes a surprisingly long time to build. (about 1 and a half hours when the pieces are somewhat organized)(the recent Vladeks Dark Fortress which has 967 pieces took me the same amount of time when the pieces where organized)

You star with a square base a slowly work your way up layering on bricks until you get the main hull done.  If you have a nice hard surface to build on you can push the bricks down really good and then this set ends up very sturdy.

This set ends up being fairly large (about 15 inches long, 12 inches wide, and about 5 inches tall.)  The interior is pretty big but yet there are not very many small details.  There is no hyperdrive (luckily that was added to the new falcon) and the compartment under the floor is only big enough for one mini-fig laying on their back.  The escape pod is nice and slides out of the ship nicely but it is not airtight!  The boarding ramp is pretty cool but it should be a bit longer so when its lowered down its not so steep) and should be a bit wider as well.  The gathering area with the playing board is very nice and you can even fit all the minifigs in that space if carefully placed.  This set should have come with a lightsaber, blast helmet, and Obi-Wan so that Luke could do some training.  The cockpit should be big enough to fit 4 minifgs (but then the whole ship needs to be bigger to be the correct size ratio).  At the moment you can fit 2 characters in the cockpit but then there is the problem of being no walkway to conect to the rest of the ship.

Its too bad that LEGO had not made a much larger Millenium Falcon on their second attempt.  An accurate LEGO Falcon needs to be about 2 feet long then there would be enough room for all the small details as the ship would be the right scale with the mini-figs.

Although there are quite a few things wrond with the ship you can help liking it a lot.  The exterior is arguably better looking than the new version but yet it is missing some of the details that were included with the new version.

Overall this set is pretty sweet with great minifigs and tons of playability.  I give it an 8.5 out of 10. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JediAwesome","2009-12-14T20:38:28.95Z","Pretty nice classic set with great minifigures","While there are many new versions of the Falcon this is my fav.  The USC version looks awesome on the outside but looks really hard to build and is too expensive to buy right now.  The 2004 version looks really good from the outside too, except the inside doesn't have much to do.  I don't like any of the other versions which are too small, although the mid-scale version does have good detail on the outside.

This set has 6 minifigs and features the main classic gang from episode 4. 

Luke Skywalker
Princess Leia 
Han Solo 
Chewbacca 
R2-D2 
C-3PO 

The Han and Leia in this set are only featured in this set, and the Chewbacca from this set only appears in one other set like this.

The falcon has a swishable turret and radar dish.  The turret can open up to place a character inside.  Two pieces on the front and back of the ship open up to reveal portions of the inside.  The cockpit's maximum can only feature two minifigs unlike the movie. The back of the ship features the blue hyperdrive.

Too see the inside of the ship you lift up two tabs of the ship's cover and pull it off.  Inside there is a swishable seat for some sort of control panel.  Nearby is the space checkers board with a sort of sofa that can seat two characters.  The smugglers compartment is also featured, but can only fit one character.  The ship comes with 6 tools that are placed in racks of some sort.  There is also a spot to hold Han's blaster. The loading ramp can open up for the characters to board the ship.  There are also three hidden compartments that feature items.  One of the compartments features Chewie's rifle while another compartment features some sort of cutting device.  The final compartment looks different and has doors that can be opened to look inside.  This is the spot for some sort of empty rebel container. 

The ship also has an espace pod that you can place a character in.  The ramp where the escape pod resides in, can be lowered to launch the espace pod.  Unfortunately the escape pod is not airtight.

The ship also has legs for landing which can be removed if you want to lift the ship up in the air.  

Overall I like the ship very much.  Not much exterior detail like the USC or 2004 versions, but for me the interior has more features than the 2004 version and can be used as a playset inside.  However the inside has many colors that don't make sense with the ship.  I recommend it if you can find it for $130 or less.  If it is for more than only get it if you really want it, and would prefer it more than other versions.  It gets a 4, because of the weird colorations for the ship inside, no bottom turret, the escape pod that is not airtight, the inability to seat 4 people within the cockpit, and limited space within the smugglers compartment.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Shez","2010-06-13T01:27:35.827Z","The First of Many to Come","<p>The Millennium Falcon is arguably one of the most iconic Star Wars ships. This version of the Millennium Falcon was really a step forward&nbsp;for Lego Star Wars back in the year 2000. Along with an important ship came along the main cast of Star Wars which included Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C3P0, R2-D2 and&nbsp;Han Solo. I have to say that this set has a great classic Star Wars feeling to it when The Lego Company was trying out their&nbsp;first licensed theme. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the Millenium Falcom took me a time of&nbsp;three and a half hours. I'm a fairly slow builder though. Seeing this ship come together was really interesting. It wasn't a boring build as almost nothing was repetitive and it has a nice variation between different pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some really great parts to this lego set. All of the print on it is actually printed and not applied by using stickers because this set came out before the idea of stickers came up. The printed pieces are great and are most evident on the top of the ship. There are also plenty of tools, weapons/blasters, transparent pieces, etc included that make this Lego set special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the&nbsp;category where this Lego set shines. It is filled with small compartments including a hinged hole inside the floor of the ship for a figure to hide in, multiple built in compartments for blasters, the front of the ship opens up to reveal storage space&nbsp;and many other hiding places are built in.&nbsp;The Lego company truly made it into&nbsp;a&nbsp;smuggling ship.&nbsp;The top of the ship is connected to a single technic piece which easily snaps off for play inside of the ship. The cockpit also snaps off easily so everything is relatively easy to get to. The only downside of the playabiltiy is that there is a snap off landing gear. In most sets produced now, the landing gear folds up and down into the ship making it much more movie accurate and playable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its design is why its 4/5 stars overall instead of 5/5. It has&nbsp;over a dozen blue and tan colored parts showing and in areas even the odd red one that really stick out. The ship is terribly undersized but I don't expect the designers to make the scale of the ship to the size of the figures&nbsp;perfect like the ultimate collector's series (UCS) version of this set. Design has greatly improved in more recent sets&nbsp;with a larger quantity of pieces to choose from and better designing programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures in this set are perfect for it.&nbsp;Six figures is about the standard for a large lego set and it also introduced the first Princess Leia figure. C3PO is no longer made in that color due to casting issues and RD-D2 has a new head design. All of the human figures are in yellow skin and Chewbacca is made in the old brown color so they aren't going to be released again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I have to say that the Millennium Falcon is a&nbsp;very important&nbsp;set to have. Although it doesn't stand up to its UCS re-release, it is still one of my personal favorites. As a collector, I prefer to have the original releases of sets so my rating and opinion on it might be a little higher then others. I hope I was able to cover everything in this review and if you have any additional questions feel free to contact me. Thanks for reading! :)</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
