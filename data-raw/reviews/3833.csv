I was happy, getting ready to open it. 1074 pieces is indeed alot! the construction manual is horrible. Instead of giving the builder a 3 dimensional view of the steps, it gives you an overhead on. This makes it hard to see the thickness of pieces and what you have and havent done. In that case, I just didnt build it, but i happened to make an awesome military base out of the pieces and use it to station all of the TIE fighters. I give it a tough 5 because you cant build it unless you are extremely smart and have at least 9 years of lego experience, it is just a model, and you cant play with it at all! However, i give it a 5 (It would be a 3) becasue with 1074 perfect pieces and alot of wall bricks, you can build some wicked buildings and a small town!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Well this is  bigger than I expected. He's fun to build and 14 inches tall! His head can turn in any direction. Somebody mentioned the instructions as a problem, but yes. The instructions are different.
Pros:
Head spins 360
Fun to build
Special instructions for easier work.

Cons:
Head bobbles a lot
