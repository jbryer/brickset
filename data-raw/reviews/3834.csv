When I saw the cover of the guide, all of the memories came flooding back.  This was such a basic set, and made some very strange looking vehicles.  I remember the boat and &quot;helicopter&quot; being my favorite.  I think it was something about being 7 years-old and having something that weighed so much in my hands. That helicopter was a strange design, only a few steps from being a car.  Definitely a good beginner set, and the memories are amazing.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
