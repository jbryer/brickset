since i'm in a bit of a hurry today, i will rate this set as quick as possible.
all is great about this set, from the removable helmet of vader, to the scarred anakin face underneath it (shouldn't the anakin face be pale white like bib fortnuna's face is?), his body with the life support, the palpatine fig has a great body and detailed wrinkled face (should have been grey, but it's fine this way) vader comes with red saber, palpatine with his cane (which is just a black stick, not crooked like the real prop, but again, it's fine since it's just lego and lego has limits, it's not an action fig)
the throne with the death star II window is greeeeaaaaaaat no complaints at all (clever re-use of the tie window) the throne rotates!
there is only one flaw that really bugs me, there is no force lightning included. i guess lego just didn't had time or money to mould electric effects but if they had just included two transparent blue flames, i would have been totally happy and given this set a big 10! now it's fine too and gets a nine for 2 great figs and a backdrop accessory that's actually movie-accurate and compliments the figures, all great, lego did a phenomenal job!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-07T07:58:38Z","if you're looking for minifigs and windows...","This might be a good set if you are looking for minifigs and for tie windows. Well there's not much to say about it. The throne is cool, but the reason why I bought it was to have vador. I like the fact that they didn't just put some black or yellow head under the mask as they do for troopers, you really get vadors face (end of ROTJ). And why complain about the mask, I think it looks good. you also get the emperor.

All in all a good cheap set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-11T16:08:26Z","Decent little set","This set is one of two nearly economy-priced sets that give you the most dramatic moments of Return of the Jedi with a some minifigs. My only, only, gripe is that the original retail price was $10, so I didn't get any until TRU and KB put them on massive clearance for $5 each. 

Minifigs: They make up most of and carry this set. What you get is the Emperor sitting in his throne with the backdrop of a TIE windscreen for the big circular window. Works perfectly, and the throne is just plain elegant. 

Vader is an awesome fig. The helmet is detailed to a level worthy of an action figure, and the only innacuracy I can spot is that it's a bit wide from profile angle, but that's to accomodate the size of a lego head. Second of all, you can unmast him! and beneath his mask lies the scarred and saddened face of Anakin Skywalker, finally liberated from his mechanical prison. 

The Emperor fig's face is appropriately stylized and the fig comes complete with a black cloak and hood. I like to use this fig to customize generic dark Jedi. 

Overall, the set is great and an incredible buy when on clearance. 9 out of 10 for having a big original retail price. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The liittle structure the emporer sits on is cool and you can simulate the real seen easily in a dark room. I give it a 10 because it is small and when something is this small, not much can screw it up, other than how small it is, that is!

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The box of course in very small since it only contains 31 parts. Instructions are self explanatory and easy to follow. I like the way they present the other sets from the wave at the back of the instructions, it shows you what you can do if you combine some sets together.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not many parts are included. But the notable ones include the TIE Fighter Cockpit window (doubling as The Emperor's view port) and Vader's chrome hilt. You even got a spare chrome hilt which Lego stopped doing shortly after these sets.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>While these minfigures have been seen many times now, at the time it was rare to get these figures in such a small set. The two are of course are Darth Vader and Emperor Palpantine. Firstly the Darth Vader figure. This is the 1999 to 2004 version. It comes with the old grey head with eye brows. The face is nicely detailed with the scars on the side of his head. It's a classics figure, how could you not love it? Next, the Emperor. This is the version with the yellow head which sorta feels odd since he had white/grey skin in the movie, of course this fixed with later additions. He comes with his cane which is a nice inclusion.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very, very simple. It can completed in about five minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>While it lacks a lot, it's still a charming set. Lego manage to convey the scene quite well. I like the control panels on the chair and it is able to turn too. And that's about it but for what's it worth, it's very nice!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall how could you not love this set? I remember how excited I was when I first got it. You get two figures which even now aren't seen that often in sets this cheap, in fact I don't they have again. It's a charming and classic set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,2,2,3,5

<h4>The Build and Playability:</h4>
<p>Building this set is very easy, as you just have a small chair and window that go on a flat brick, basically. However, this small amount of pieces gives you a pretty nice looking product: a swiveling Emperor's chair. In addition, you get some nice rarer parts, like a TIE window and some special black pieces. But mainly, the minifigs are what make the set. Play is kind of limited if you don't have 7201, unless you want to just pit Vader against the Emperor.</p>

<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>Vader is nothing special, and the Emperor is just your average one, not to mention both of these figures have been hugely outdated by flesh colors and new, more accurate prints, but the thing that rocks is the price. You get DARTH VADER AND THE EMPEROR for just 7 dollars. These figs may be outdated, but that was a good deal, way back then.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like Jedi Defense, also released in the same year, Final Duel I on it's own isn't 100% great, but it is a charming looking display piece, and it does offer up two rare Mini-Figures. Also this set was concieved of long before we ever got the Death Star, so really it is a bargain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get to build a little throne for the Emperor and the window behind him. It doesn't take long and probably would take less than five minutes to finish. But once it is built it gives you a lot of great potential for playing. As I said this set includes Yellow Faced Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. Both figures are rare in this price range to find and a welcome addition to any LEGO Mini-Figure collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall however I'd say if you already have a Vader and Palpatine from one of the larger sets then tracking this one down might not be altogether necessary. Unless you want a yellow faced Palpatine to stand amongst your LEGO City or regular Space Theme display.

<p>old sets (especially star wars) are very expensive to get with the box, even the small sets. I did not get the box but I did get the instructions. The instructions are unique to the old star wars sets and I like the format of them. On the back, it advertises the old lego star wars website and the 2002 star wars sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts that stood out to me were</p>

<p>the tie fighter window</p>

<p>the 2 printed tiles on the chair</p>

<p>and the base plate</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures-2</h3>

<p>DARTH VADER (2002): The darth vader figure is a common figure but comes in the expensive lego sets. Getting it for $6.00 is such a good deal. He has the original&nbsp;vader printing so not a lot of it, he also has his trademark cape, helmet, and lightsaber. Like all of the darth vader figures (not the 2014 and 2015 figures), he has black plain legs. Under his helmet is a scarred with no eyebrows Anakin skywalker\vader face. He weilds&nbsp;the chrome lightsaber.</p>

<p><img src=""http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/lego/images/d/dc/Vader.png/revision/latest?cb=20100829060910"" /></p>

<p>DARTH SIDIOUS\THE EMPEROR (2002): What could get better then having darth vader&nbsp;in a set? Probably having the emperor in a cheap set. He has the same cape and legs as darth vader. His robes look like the luke&nbsp;old figure. He has the hood covering his face and he has a wrinkled old yellow face. His weapon is a cane.</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.mypipeline2u.com/uploads/8/4/6/2/8462746/s539891489228194836_p2_i1_w600.jpeg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It didn&#39;t take me long at all. It took me around a minute.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Not very detailed like the new versions of this set (final duel 2015 and death star). The emperor can look out his tie fighter window and sit in his chair. The chair does swivel so the emperor can look out the window or at darth vader. Very week in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set is more like a battle pack like the other 3 (final duel 2, jedi duel 1 and 2). We get 2 awesome minifigures which are hard to get in cheap sets. I do like the throne and the window but i think they could have added more and made it a $15.00 set. I really like the minifigs but not the build. Be sure to check out my other reviews and i will see you all next time</p>

"Maltheus","2017-03-02T23:55:30.777Z","""Good... gooooood...""","<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">This set features Emperor Palpatine&#39;s throne room from Return of the Jedi. I&#39;m not quite sure when and where I got this set, but chances are it was a small extra-gift from my mother for my eleventh birthday.</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Box/Instructions</h3>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">It&#39;s a simple cardboard box, which, disappointingly, does not show any alternate builds on the back. Instead, we get the same picture from the front, only with a different background, along with two stills from the movie, showing Darth Vader and the Emperor, respectively. The back of the box also tells us to combine this set with 7201 in order to have Luke and Vader fight against each other.</p>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">The Instruction booklet is easy enough to follow and tells you everything you need to know. There&#39;s also a few pages worth of ads, showing you which other Star Wars sets there are to collect. Somewhat interestingly, the instructions tell you to put Vader&#39;s lightsaber in his left hand, despite him being right-handed in the movies.</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Parts</h3>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Not much to say here, the set comes with a couple of black and grey bricks to build the Emperor&#39;s throne and the window through which he can look into the vastness of space. Nothing to spectacular here. I am at least impressed with how well the Tie-Fighter cockpit piece works as the throne room window. Also, in my set, one of the default SW control panel bricks for the throne is printed a lot darker than the other. Guess the darker one is a misprint.</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Minifigures</h3>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">Both Palpatine and Vader were pretty rare figures at the time, especially since you could only get them from buying some of the more expensive sets. I guess for people with less disposable income, this set was an easy way to get a Palpatine and Vader for their kids. I&#39;m not sure why they gave the Emperor yellow skin, though, his skin looks to be of a greyish-white in the movies. Maybe they did this to differentiate him from Vader&#39;s grey head, but to me, it just looks kinda off and I remember actually switching their heads around as a child, because I was really disappointed with yellow skinned Palpatine.</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The build</h3>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">For a 30 pieces set, it&#39;s a pretty accurate representation of the throne room, I think. They captured the design of Palpatine&#39;s chair really well, right up to the little canopy on top. The whole set is fairly easy to build and it hardly takes more than two minutes to get it assembled.</p>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">I have a slight issue with Palpatine&#39;s throne, however, because he tends to get his cape bunched up when seated. I don&#39;t know if having him seated for longer periods of time makes his cape wrinkly, but it definitely does look pretty weird.</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Playability</h3>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">While the model itself offers no action features (apart from having the Emperor revolve in his chair), the fact that you get a Palpatine and a Vader figure makes for great playability. At least I as I child loved having Vader hoist the Emperor up and throwing him down an imaginary shaft to his death.</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Overall Opinion</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm""><span lang=""en-US"">It&#39;s a nice little set and at least at the time was an easy way to get a hold of the two main villains of the original trilogy. For people who love Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader like myself, this set is definitely pretty neat. </span></p>
