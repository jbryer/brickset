The minifigs carry the set. 

Luke is a post-Jabba the Hutt spiffy Jedi Knight with gloved right hand and lightsaber. in his concerned gaze resides the determination to rescue the galaxy from the Emperor as he allows himself to be captured and to face Darth Vader. 

The Imperial Officer is a nice add-on decently figged in dark gray and a filling element to this sequence from Return of the Jedi. The Emperor would be nothing without his Imeprial army.

And speaking of which, you get a fully-armed stormtrooper. In a set that retails for $10! The stormtrooper fig is perfectly rendered with a brand new helmet disign and a striking paint-job. 

Finally, I like this set so much because Lego basically made way to many of them and they stayed around until TRU and KB put them on clearance for half price. This was the set made for army-building. 10 out of 10 for the all-star lineup of minifigs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

They are my second favorite character in starwars behind Han Solo. Anyways, this set is a 10 because it has stormtroopers, and an Imperial officer. I wish that lego hadnt made the Imperial officer a plain old smiley-face, that is just too ordinary for a dude with his rank. The good Luke head comes with this set and his upgraded green lightsaber. This is a must-have if you want a lowcost Star Wars set and if you especially want a stormie!

over all

kewl! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-18T17:11:07Z","only needs a second Stormie to make it perfect","just like the other three story-telling sets, (Jedi Defense I &amp; II and Final Duel I) this set is basically a minifig-pack with an additional backdrop. In this particular case we get Luke with his green ligthsaber, a Stormie with a megaphone/blaster and an AWESOME Imperial Officer, with the addition of a small archway.

It is supposed to represent the arch that connects the AT-AT to the corridor on Endor Base, I guess. It doesn't really look like the real thing; they could have included clear wall-pieces to make it look more like the actual corridor and less like a small stage, but in tiny sets like these, it's all about the figs and the backdrop is just a bonus (though we actually pay extra for them)

since it's all about the figs, lets talk about them here. The Luke figure is neat and looks like you'd expect him to look in Lego form, with one 'gloved' black hand as a nice detail.
There are some things however that bug me a bit. One, his face is just like Ep1 Obi's, which is a bit of a shame. It's a good face, but getting a reused face is disappointing. Secondly, I don't really like the blonde hair. It's fine for an ep4 Luke, in which he was still a fresh farmboy and I guess it's still passable for an ep5 Luke, but for RotJ, the blonde hair doesn't cut it anymore. The hair of Mark Hamill (Luke's actor) was a lot darker in RotJ and a brown hairpiece is actually more appropiate here. It looks much better on him. Thirdly, his torso is wrong. It's the same print of Luke's Jedi costume found with the Jabba-themed Luke figures, which is appropiate for the Jabba and Endor scenes, but from the moment this set is based on, he wears only the black jumpsuit without the vest-thing over it. I don't really like the Jedi look of Luke here, since he looked so simple, so vulnerable in the basic jumpsuit in the movie and that look is not present here.
However, with some customising, Luke is a lot more presentable :)
Onto the Stormie. I can't say anything more about him that isn't already said by someone else here. It's just a perfect figure and a cute one at that.
And finally, there is the Imperial Officer. And oh boy, I LOOOOVE this figure. Now, some here have issues with the Officer's classic smile face, but I really like it. Lego Star Wars figures are blokcy and somewhat fat, so none looks quite normal. They have always been comical and tha't's why I like the Lego Star Wars figures so much. I don't mind squatty cute Stormies and I don't mind a cute smile on an Imperial Officer, it just adds to the adorability of the figure. The Officer's torso print is great as well and I have no complaints about the li'l guy.
But... there seems to be something mssing. What? Oh yeah, a second Stormie! In the movie, Luke was escorted by the Officer and two Stormies, not one. Adding a second Stormie would have made this set soooo much better. Now, I've included my only other Stormie (from the Ewok Attack set) with this set and it looks MUCH better.
 phew, almost done. So the Stormie and Officer are perfect, Luke is adequate and there's not much to the archway, as it's meant to be with these sets. Which means this set is great, but not quite perfect: 8.5/10, making it a 9/10 since I can't give half points.

This is another one of those sets where what you see is what you get. It's basically three mini-figs and a walk way. The walkway is quite simple but very effective. It would have been nice to get a bit more but it cant be helped.

The first mini-fig is a Storm Trooper, dressed in all white with a really cool helmet and torso that is printed on both sides. The other cool thing about this guy is he has no face, just a plain yellow head, making him quite uncommon. He also has a form of blaster in his hand.

The second guy is a imperial commander i think. He appears to be some sort of army rank anyway. He is dressed in full grey and has a plain old smiley face which is a bit of a let down. His hat is a true cap which is quite nice to see.

The third and final guy is Luke Skywalker. He is dressed in a fully black robe, which looks really good. He has blond hair and I think he is wearing a glove as one hand is black and the other yellow. His face has eyebrows and his mouth is straight, looking kind of like the standard face , but better. He is also armed with a Lightsaber that is neon green.

Overall I really liked this model simple because for such a small model you get three mini figs, which puts the playability way up and this set goes in well with the other Duel and two defence sets, making it a great collection. Aesthetically it looks good and goes great on display. I feel this set is a 7/10 or Great and would recommend it to any Star wars fan or someone who is looking for a few different mini-figs cheap.

The imperial soldier is also very well made, with some simple details and a characteristic hat. Luke Skywalker, too simple but also nicely designed, have few details of a jedi black clothing and a white hat. The lightsaber included don't have the &quot;blade&quot;, but it still cool. The few building is above the plate, and there is a gate, that is a solid piece, simple but useful. Other buildings above the small gray plate are the two small rails.

<p>There isn't much of a build, really, but with about 8 parts, you get a little... bridge/walkway thing. The doorway piece&nbsp;is nice, but really impossible to use inside an actual hallway, unless implemented as a hatch for outside something. The two railings are nice as well, but that's pretty much as far as special parts goes. The main focus, again, is the minifigs, and this set gives you 3.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all it isn't really a set to be built up. It is more akin to one of the Battle Packs, not the Star Wars ones, but the ones available at LEGO <a href=""mailto:Shop@Home"">Shop@Home</a> where you get to buy five or so Mini-Figures and accessories. Secondly it features an odd choice for models, you are building up one part of a walkway from the large Imperial Landing Platform seen in the film, it's barely enough room to stand all three Mini-Figures really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that isn't to say this set is bad, far from it, it has some interesting pieces. The doorway/archway, the railings on the side in black instead of brown (as seen on the Desert Skiff set.) and it includes some great new Mini-Figures. Luke the Jedi Knight, a Stormtrooper and the first (I beleive at the time) Imperial Officer. A pity you only got one blaster for the Stormtrooper though and no weapons for the Officer, you'd think he'd also need a blaster when stationed on a world obviously targeted for attack by the Rebels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this set is a fun little display piece and a cheap way to get a few extra Stormtroopers and yellow faced Imperial Officers for your LEGO Star Wars collection. It also enhanced Final Duel I quite nicely allowing for Luke to battle with Darth Vader while the Emperor and the others watch. It's also a good source of some rare pieces for MOCers, the archway and the walkway railings are both nice pieces good for incorporating into larger builds/models.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two minifigures exclusive to this set: Luke Skywalker and the Imperial Officer.&nbsp; These specific figures are not found in any other set.&nbsp; The Imperial Officer is nothing special and I think he should have had an expression other than a standard smiley face because it is kind of ridiculous for a bad guy to have that expression.&nbsp; Luke is dressed in his black jedi knight clothes and has a black hand to represent his artificial hand (he also comes with a light saber).&nbsp; You also get one of the old stormtroopers with the plain yellow head, but that comes in a few different sets.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is really easy.&nbsp; There are no complicated steps and there are so few pieces that there is no way it could be difficult.&nbsp; A younger builder would have no trouble with this.<br></p>

Nice sand colored hair and a black robotic hand on one side. He comes with a very shiny chrome lightsaber hilt. The imperial officer has a nice design with a torso print and hat. Standard face is fine, sadly he comes with no weapon. Lastly the stormtrooper, a predecessor that fits well into my current collection. he has no face but a blaster made from a megaphone, works fine.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This was a worthwhile purchase because of the imperial officer and luke. the catwalk is made from simple parts so it is easy to repeatedly expand to make a MOC. other than that it makes a good display piece of the lukes surrender scene If you have a vader minifig.</p>

The box is nice. I have always enjoyed the box/ instructions art from this time period. The instructions are pretty standard.</p>

<p>Before I go on to the Minifigs, I will take a quick look at the build. This is supposed to represent Luke Skywalker getting taken to Darth Vader. I think it does it&#39;s job in that sense. It&#39;s just so boring. There is nothing really that bad about it, it&#39;s just not interesting. I think Lego should have at least gave us a sliding door. A larger platform would be nice, as there is not much place to put Minifigs.</p>

<p>Speaking of Minifigs, I&#39;ll talk about that. For me personally, they are the only thing that&#39;s keeping this set from being one of the worst. The Stormtrooper is very nice. Mine even has the fun moustache miss print. It&#39;s charm is it&#39;s simplicity. He/she has a pure yellow head and a bullhorn blaster. The next is Luke Skywalker, in his Jedi Knight robes. This figure is exclusive, but it&#39;s not really a bit deal. It&#39;s just the black hand. His printing it very simple, but good enough for his time. He has a green lightsaber with a chrome hilt. &nbsp;Next is arguably the most interesting Minifig, the imperial officer. He is the only imperial officer to come out in the old grey. His chest printing is not exclusive, but it was when it first came out. Overall, great fig. My only &quot;complaint&quot; is the head. I can see kids thinking he might be a good guy.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a neat little set. The built is ok, but the Minifigs make up for that. This is a cool little set for any collection.</p>

"Baron1","2020-11-22T21:43:50.683Z","Good Minifigure Pack","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This set, being the smallest boxed lego set ever (I think?) Anyway, if you want to buy this set, you want it for the mini figures. The build is basically a few parts and isn&#39;t really something you could play with, but could be used to stand the figures on.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting 3 figures in an old set for cheap is great. It is great to get a storm trooper in a cheap set. They didn&#39;t come in too many back in the day. The Imperial officer is decent, and reminds me of a train conductor but is unique. Luke Skywalker is the highlight of the set IMO, getting a chrome lightsaber hilt and a famous character is definitely good.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall 7/10, if you want to get some old mini figures, or want to start your collection of old Star Wars sets, like I did, I do recommend it.</p>
