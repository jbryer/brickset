"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-10T10:04:26Z","my fav droids made immortal in lego form!!!","the destroyer droids are my favourite type of droids, they make such a cool sound when rolling, when firing, have this creepy look standing on three legs and walk just as creepy, have a blue deflector shield and just look menacing. the lego versions of the droideka's are perfect giving the fact lego made the droids almost entirely out of very common pieces. (xcpet maybe the battle-droid torso's as heads and the colour scheme for some pieces)lego still managed to make them look good, they have great articulation, more than their hasbro action fig counterparts! and they can roll up, sort of, convincing enough for me. the blasters consisting of western revolvers and binoculars are very cleverly designed and make this set a worthy purchase if you wantsome xtra revolvers (5 are include) for your western sets. but that's just a waste of such a cool set, 'cause not only the droids look stunning, so does obi-wan, with his blue saber (after red, my fav saber colour. no purple for me, yikes!) and the braid on his torso is a nice detail, but i would have preferred a real padawan hairpiece instead of this way too common hairpiece that appears with too many figs who actually need special hair (ep2 anakin, dooku, even OT obi... only luke &amp; han look kinda good with this hair) so xcept for this minor flaw, this is just a great set with sweeet droids and a nice obi with hair!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T11:46:21Z","Decent set","This set was one of 4 'storytellers' Lego originally released for starwars, those being the Jedi Defense and Final Duel sets. If they're still on the shelf, they're probably on clearance, so they're great sources for minifigs and army-building. 

For me, this set stands in the shadow of it's Qui-gon counterpart, just because I like the regular droids more than the destroyers; I don't think that's a very common opinion, though. On it's own, the destroyer droids are big and menacing, and Obi is rendered nicely, although I wish they had given him a new face piece instead of copying the Luke from Final Duel face. If you're like me and won't keep all your destroyer droids set up, these are a great source of flat 2x1 plates with the center stud on top and you get five of those revolver pistols (one extra) for all your old fashioned gunfight needs. My only gripe is that I just don't like the painted padawan braid on the torso. Set gets 9 for great part variety.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This particular set is what you see three figures. One a LEGO man the other two are robots.

The mini-fig I believe is a guy named Obi-Wan Kenobi. Has a plain face, with eye brows and standard hair with brown pants and cape, also he has a robe like shirt on. His weapon is a cool blue light saber, which is a nice one to have.

The two robots are grey and brown, with three legs and a blaster in each arm. They look quite impressive, with lots of movement and are very different to any other robot I have , star wars, or otherwise.

Overall its a nice little set, with a fair bit of play ability, great for building armies or just for something different in your LEGO collection and deserves a solid 6/10 or above average, just because of it's uniqueness.

This set allowed you to get two Droidekas and Obi-Wan Kenobi rather cheaply for your Episode One display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the older style of Droideka or Destroyer Droid involves a limited number of pieces, but they do the job of conveying what this character looks like in LEGO Form, it is these versions which are seen in the Star Wars LEGO Video Games as opposed to the newer take on the Droideka, and I'm glad of that. I actually prefer this look to the newer version, it isn't as bulky looking or smooth, but it looks much better than the wonky design that tries too hard to match the actual design from the movies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is worth having, and if you could get more than one of them all the better, but if not you could always pick up a bunch of pieces from LEGO and use the instructions from this set to build up even more Destroyer Droids to fuel your LEGO Droid Army needs. Better I suppose in the long run than having an army of Padawan Obi-Wans running around.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"wander099","2011-01-30T12:24:23.953Z","Droidekas!","<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions booklet is clear and easy 
to follow.  As with many of the sets I got when I was a child I no 
longer have the box.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts for this set are pretty good considering its 
size.  This is mostly because the droidekas require so many pieces to 
construct.  It should be noted that the majority of pieces are quite 
small.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This is where the real value of the set lies.  
This is the first set to include a droideka figure, and you get two of 
them!  The fact that only one subsequent set contained this version of 
the droideka, which I maintain is the better version, makes it even more
 valuable.  The only other figure included in this set is Obi-Wan 
Kenobi.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is pretty easy, but might pose somewhat 
of a problem for younger builders given the number of small pieces 
needed for the droidekas, so some help may be required.  But this will 
be made up for in play value.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As I mentioned before, the droidekas are 
the best part of this set.  This version was the original design and I 
think it is much better than the second attempt.  In the second attempt I
 think lego tried to hard to copy the movie exactly and as a result came
 up with an awkward-looking design.  These droidekas look good and make 
great bad guys when playing.  The clear brick underneath creates the 
illusion that the legs are supporting the entire figure and adds 
stability.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>This set is an excellent addition to any Star Wars 
lego collection.  While Obi-Wan isn't really anything special, this original version of the droideka is only available in TWO sets, one of which is 
this one.  It is even better when combined with Jedi Defence II because 
it comes with the door, 2 battle droids, and Gui-Gon Jinn and you can 
act out the beginning scene from Episode I.",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-25T17:00:29.513Z","One of those simple, yet cool, sets that LEGO used to release","This set was my second set ever, after 4810. This set includes two destroyer droids and Obi-wan Kenobi, as a padawan. This set is actually quite good- the two destroyer droids are awesome and Obi-wan's fig is pretty cool too, with a padawan braid printed on his chest and a lightsaber in his hand. There isn't really much of a build here though- you build the same thing twice, then put Obi-wan's head on his torso and his legs underneath. Though that isn't to say the set doesn't have value. The droidekas are built of LEGO pistols, binoculars, and those droid arm pieces too, in grey. Not to mention it is fun to be Obi-wan and LITERALLY destroy the droids! Overall its a good set with good value.",FALSE,4,4,2,3,5
"Struhadlo","2021-06-03T12:32:12.197Z","The best Droidekas by Lego ever.. sadly","<p>When I was a wee lad I used to hypnotise this set in a Lego catalogue, sadly, Lego was heavily overpriced in my poor little country in 2002 and nobody was paying over $12 in those day&#39;s money for this, especially my&nbsp;parents. But what do you know, in 2021 my dreams cam true and I bought this set sealed.</p>

<p>I am seriously pondering giving this set 3 out of 5 as it is not that special, but it is kind of hard to craft anything special when you are on a $7 budget. Furthermore, the fanboys of nostalgia gang would probably shred me to crap if I did.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>Judging price&nbsp;on such a small set is pointless as it has more than enough content to make up for the $7. I just have to emphasise that in my country, where we have a large Lego factory, and we are definitely among the poorer countries of Europe, every set was gregariously overpriced. For example <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7163-1/Republic-Gunship"">7163</a>&nbsp;was in 2002 money almost $150 (which is over 220 today). It really makes me appreciate the idea of producing smaller less detailed sets for less money in 2021 even thou Lego has chilled on the prices since 2002 a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>Set has basically no regular builds or even scenery and is by some considered to be a predecessor to battle packs. I do not agree with this sentiment as I disagree on Droidekas being minifigs.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Obi-Wan Kenobi. I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the Obi-Wan is. The print quality is honestly better than on many modern minifigs. It is the skin on the torso where most modern minifigs fail horrendously (e.g. <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw1021"">Han Solo</a>), but the yellow here looks perfect. The lines are sharp and there is quite a bit of detail. There is no back, arm or leg print but as I said, the torso print is supreme. The face does not fail too much in&nbsp;its attempt to simulate Obi-Wan&#39;s face and the hair piece helps it a bit. Obi is armed with a blue lightsaber with the old chrome hilt. These hilts got replaced because the colour chipped a lot. And on one of my hilts did chip just by putting it in one of my minifig&#39;s hand after just few days.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>It might be controversial, but I would say that the Droidekas are builds and not minifigs. As such I would go as far as saying that these are the best Droidekas we have ever got from Lego, it is kind of sad, but any newer rendition just failed in either making them too large or just ugly. Otherwise, lovely <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75092-1/Naboo-Starfighter"">75092</a>&nbsp;comes with the newest model, and it just cannot get the arms with the guns right, also the shaping is just pain to look at. These older destroyers were just simple and very skeletal, but kept pretty faithful and convincing look. They might not have the best legs, but the remainder of their bodies looks pretty decent. The build is somewhat sturdy and nothing falls apart. Furthermore, it is sweet to get few grey revolver guns and many light grey B1 arms. I have personally removed the clear round 2 by 2 piece from their bottom as the legs provide enough of stability needed for all kinds of play and display.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>The playability factor here leans more towards the imagination spectrum as the set has no action play features which I&nbsp;do not think is a bad thing. The figure of a beloved character with two formidable opponents is enough for few fun filled afternoons and for such a small set it captures a lot of action without any excessive stud shooters, missiles or any&nbsp;half-hearted play features.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I miss these small sets I truly do. I wish Lego did make more sets like this nowadays. Microfighters are cool, but they can be hardly considered a regular play set and battle packs start at $15. It would be great if each year we got few 10 &ndash; 15 USD sets with one or two figs and a small build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fun thing is, this set comes with a poster which is also a thing Lego no longer does. Overall this set packs a lot of music for not a lot of money. Cool display piece too.&nbsp;</p>

"Beskar_256","2020-10-19T03:42:39.1Z"," Review 7203-1: Jedi Defense I","<p>This set was one of three sets based on Star Wars The Phantom Menace, and is one of the first sets to feature the first iteration of the Destroyer Droid.</p>

<p>The box looks fantastic. On the front, it has a very nice looking picture of the contents. The back shows the same picture along with picture form the film and the set it goes with. The instructions feature some nice ads in the back.</p>

<p>The builds could also be considered Minifigures, and they are Destroyer Droids. I think they look fantastic. They look better than the more recent ones and have quite a bit of poses that they can do. The two revolver pieces that each one has is a nice bonus. Did I mention you get two? I am quite impressed for such a early set.</p>

<p>This set also features Obi-Wan Kenobi as a padawan. I think this figure is decent. He shares the same face with Luke Skywalker, which is a little disappointing, but I think the age makes up for it. The printing is nice, featuring robes and a padawan braid. He has a cape and a chrome hilted lightsaber. Could be better, but still a nice figure to have.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set does its job. While the playability is off, this is purely because is mostly just contains figures. The Destroyer Droids are very nice, and Kenobi is a decent figure. I am pleased with this set, and is a nice addition to any Lego Star Wars collection.</p>
