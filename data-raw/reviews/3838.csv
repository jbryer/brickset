Now, if they're still on store shelves, they're probably on clearance, so these sets are great minifig sources. 

Good:

Figs: Everything. Qui-gon is a full Jedi Master fig with a torso that can be used for any Jedi and a really nice hairpiece. The Droids are awesome and this is a perfect set for army building.

And of course, the big sliding door is actually really nice as these extras in the lego sets go. I like it more than the vaporator included in Tusken Raider Encounter; you can hide, pretend it's the detention block, stage a hallway shootout, etc. 
My one nitpick is that the megaphone blasters are a little big on the droids. 

I'm most impressed that of the four 'storyteller' sets, this one was the first to completely sell out at the KBtoys I shop. Set gets a 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T22:20:51Z","Good Set For Droids","This set is an awsome set. It is one of the few sets to get battle droids(only set for security droids). Although it could have been larger; including two more battle droids. Here's what I think about it:

PLUS:

     droids
     Qui Gon
     door

MINUS:

     not enough droids
     too expensive for such a small set

OVERALL:

     A very good set. I completely guarantee it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-18T16:50:44Z","great if you have Jedi Defense I, good on its own as well","I think Jedi Defense II is not quite as good as Jedi Defense I but that's just a personal opinion, because I prefer Droideka's over regular Battle Droids.

This is only my second Qui-Gon Jinn minifig, so I'm not growing weary of him just yet. :) He's still good.

The door is nice, nothing too special but always a good addition. In small sets like these (jedi Defense I &amp; II, Final Duel I &amp; II) there just needs to be SOMEthing made out of bricks, so that there is actually something Lego-ish about these sets, which are basically just minifig-packs. Background props like this one are always welcome in my book, even if it ups the cost a bit.

The gem of this set are the two droids of course, and the rare yellow commander (only other set that contains him is the minifig-pack #4) and dark red Security Droid exclusive to this set, are the perfect droids to command my enormous impressive droid army consisting of four Battle Droids total! :D both come with megaphone-blasters as well
the unique colours of these two droids made me buy this small set, since I had no real use for the Qui-Gon and the door.
However, now that I have both Jedi Defense sets, I really like the doorpiece, it looks pretty good having the two Jedi and a bunch of droids at the door, just like in the movie. They make for a rather decent display

"Imperial13","2007-07-27T18:13:15.643Z","Qui-Gon!","I got this set when i was little and spent tons of time playing with it.it comes with the getting hard to find chrome saber, two droids that are only in this set (besides MTT), and some strange door from episode 1. They really shouldn't have put Mr. Gon in this set, because the droids dont have a chance! I would recommend picking up this set WITH  Jedi Duel 7103!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tonga256","2007-09-19T06:16:56.903Z","if only I knew the futcher","I wouldn't have got this set if I knew about the clones. You see, right now I'm a clone collector, not a droid collector. I want to make my very own clone army all I have is three sets with clones in them. it's just not enough for an army, but when i play with them theres only two droids to fight witch is from this set. Thats why I`m geting the DROIDS BATTLE PACK soon to fight the clones. So I actually would get this set if I knew the futcher I think.

"Blade","2008-02-27T00:18:40.297Z","2nd Review","I have already posted a review for this set a fair while ago now (July - October 2007) and I noticed a few weeks ago my review for this set and two others had disappeared for no reason so I am re-reviewing this set.

Well again, I have never seen a star wars film and probably never will, but still I intend to review all my star wars LEGO and give a non-bias review. This particular set is more about what you get rather than how much you get.

A couple of people have mentioned it is just a door with three figures. Well the door itself is awesome. The front of the door looks really cool and is very well designed using different bricks of different textures, colours and shades. The door slides up and down. Yes it's one of those cool space doors. I ended up using mine as the entrance to one of my space bases for a bit.

The mini-fig is a person named Qui-Gon Jinn from what I gather and he looks quite serious dressed in brown pants, a robe like shirt and a brown cape. He is also armed with a cool green light saber.

The other two things are robots or droids. I like them because they are unique and look different to my other mini-figs. They also have megaphone blasters, which always ensure a good time.

Overall it is a neat little set and you get some cool parts in it. Slightly over priced back in the day but should be able to pick it up or a very reasonable price nowadays. I feel this set is a 6/10 or Above Average is it has lots of cool pieces and the playability is hight due to having three mini-figs but it was way over priced. A great one for star wars fans and a nice one to get if you are looking for something different.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Jon_Brick","2008-04-04T23:58:58.937Z","&quot;Uh oh, blast them&quot; ","I love this set because it is one of the most inexpensive (yet good) sets I've ever purchased. I got this set and Jedi Defense 1 at the Loblaws near my house (which also had Final Duel 1&amp;2) for 2.99 cnd. I was glad because I didn't have to buy this set at Wal-Mart which had it for 5.99 cnd, so when I saw this set for 2.99 cnd I was really happy because I had five dollars on me and I just had to borrow two dollars from my brother and I got both Jedi Defense sets.

This set is great because it comes with Qui-Gon Jin two battle droids
and blast doors (which is great because you can make a little base for the bad guys). This set was also great because It is simple yet has pretty good playablity(especially with Jedi Defense 1).This set would have gotten a 9/10 but since I got it at such a great price it gets a 10/10

pros:
Qui-Gon Jin
two battle droids
blast doors(they are still getting through)

cons:
average price (5.99 cnd)

"Gus_263","2008-04-04T14:48:20.593Z","Jedi Defense II","Another little set of the Star Wars theme, the Jedi Defense II includes three minifigures and a small gate. The two droids included are the same of other sets, have some good details, of course not have the lego original minifigure shape, have a better shape to it and stay playable like a minifigure. The body is red coloured that makes it better and with a weapon in old style. These weapons are so much big for the droids, and the droids hang it with the hands in another side, that is better to move but don't likes much it on the movie. Altough the hands weapons are bad positioned, the hands are better to move. The Qui Gon's minifigure is simple but good designed and with some details. The minifigure have a different style of hair, a cover and a cool green lightsaber. The small gate is made basically with a gray plate and some blocks increasing it, a little cool scenery. Altough the set have no much building involved and few playability, this small is more to increase other, and includes three nice minifigures, a cheap option to increase other Star Wars sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T22:23:34.12Z","Have you ever Fought a Jedi Before?","<p>Set #7204 Jedi Defense II: Jedi Defense II is meant to be enhanced with Jedi Defense I, both sets combined represent the battle between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and the Trade Federation forces aboard the Droid Control Ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this set you build a small doorway that can slide up and down to open and close, you also get three Mini-Figures, another Qui-Gon Jinn, a Droid Commander and a Security Droid. I have to admit without Jedi Defense I this set isn't as impressive looking, there's something quite menacing about having two Droidekas and two Battle Droids attacking both Jedi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO was possibly testing out new waters with these types of sets and when they found that they weren't entirely acceptable to some&nbsp;LEGO Star Wars fans they perhaps&nbsp;went back to the drawing board to give us the LEGO Star Wars Battle Packs. I don't think there's really anything bad about these little sets. They offer up a cheap way to get some Mini-Figures, they succeed in representing a scene from Episode One and they also make for a way to build up an even bigger Droid Army. The Security Droid in particular is a rareity as far as Mini-Figures go, so that's a plus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I'd say if you can get both sets for your collection, great, but if you had to choose one I'd go for Jedi Defense I over this one, more Droidekas are always better than having a useless door in the middle of nowhere. I'm kind of hoping we'll see a large corridor set or something one of these days to represent this scene properly, but for now I can live with these two little sets. And proudly.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"Obi_wan_Legobi","2011-07-20T00:33:13.043Z","""They're still coming through. This is impossible!"" -Nute Gunray","Impossible for some jedi but not for Qui-Gon Jinn! This is a very important set for me because if I never got it, I would not have Qui-Gon or his crazy hair; and he is very important because he found Anikin and helped him become a jedi. That's the main reason why I think this is a good set to have: it's cheap and comes with Qui-Gon. But there are other reasons to get this set, if you didn't already get it. The door is pretty universal. It doesn't have any symbols on it so it can be used wherever you need a door. It's also nice to have extra droids, although the yellow commander droid has a weird square on its back, and I don't know what it's for. And the build is super easy. So, if you don't have it and can find it for a descent price, I say get it; especially if it comes in a package deal with Jedi Defense I, because they work so well together!",FALSE,4,3,5,4,5
"wander099","2011-01-30T13:59:52.15Z","Goes Great with Jedi Defence I","<p>I got this set with Jedi Defence I a long time ago and the only reason I got it was so that I could have the pair.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are easy to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not recall what the box looked like; I no longer have it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are minimal, but considering that its primary value is the minifigures, that is not surprising.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The droids in this set were quite unusual because, if I recall correctly, most battle droids included in sets at the time were the standard ones without any markings.&nbsp; In this set you get a command droid and a security droid.&nbsp; You also get Gui-Gon Jinn, but considering that he came in a number of sets, that is of little value (I have three identical Gui-Gon's)<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very easy.&nbsp; Could be completed by a younger builder with no assistance.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is unimpressive without other Star Wars sets to supplement it.&nbsp; The door can be opened and Gui-Gon can be made to fight the droids, but that is about it.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would advise buying this set only if you have Jedi Defence I, are interested in replicating the opening scene from Episode I, or want the specific droids included.&nbsp; Personally, without Jedi Defence I, I would never buy this set.&nbsp; It's just not worth it considering what you get.<br></p>",TRUE,2,1,1,2,3
