This is the blockier of the two (possibly three) sets available. The hinges are bricks and not plates like the other one, so there's one reason to dislike it. The set is hardly posable, neither of the to is... But they are still free!

This was a rather flimsy model, but aquiring it now is beyond my knowledge. Hey, it's not great, but it is still a free promo!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
