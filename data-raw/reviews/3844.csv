"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:40:56Z","Rain pours, imagination soars","Just because it’s summer doesn’t mean it’s sunny all the time; that was certainly the case in Germany in 1981.  During a break from the rain one summer day, we got a ride to the nearby toy store and I bought the 722 with yard-mowing money that was burning a big hole in my pocket.  I got home and no sooner had opened the set in the living room when the sky opened up.  Not being allowed outdoors in the pouring rain didn’t seem so bad then; combining the 722 with the 851 tractor set guaranteed that I would be staying inside anyway.

Red and grey pieces make up the majority of the 722’s parts, and there are a lot of cool one-of-a-kind pieces here, like a winch, propellers, hinges, big doors, and enough wheels and axles to build just about anything that rolls.  It comes with instructions for five models (the best model was the jeep-and-boat-with-trailer), and the parts are widely available, so losing a piece or two wasn’t a big deal – just go get replacements from your stash.  Like the 910 of the 1970s, it is hard to beat the 722’s user-friendly feel, which I guess is what makes them both &quot;basic&quot; sets.  9/10, 25 April 2004",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"m1rec","2006-02-21T02:47:56Z","My first LEGO set","It was december 1985 when my parent gave me this LEGO set. I was 7 years old and my father bring this set to me from Germany.
I was very surpriesed about this kind of play, because I am from Czechoslovakia and to play with LEGO that was very unique.
Now is quite difficult to rate this set as I have some great memories to it, but I am more focussing about Technic stuff now.

Great set to start with lego at 7 years old. Many variants to build. The five in manual is just start.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"syslam","2009-06-09T13:02:12.653Z","good for any young first lego player","I got this when I was 5 or 6. I felt that I did not fully enjoy the fun of playing this set because I was too young and only followed the instructions given, with seldom modifications or making own creations.

The color combinations, red and grey very good. Very versatile, many different things ( not only vehicles ) can be made, like helicopter, crane tower, of course many different vehicles, and even ships, instead of the limited choices like the recent creator sets.

The new creator sets have advantages of new special or sophisticated parts, like many car windows, exhause pipes, car lamps, etc and good for veteran players, but I will recommend this 722 set for any new players and my children in the future because of unlimited choices of creations.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"stevosowl","2009-11-16T08:33:50.437Z","Fantastic retro set","
This was my first set, given as a surprise Birthday present from my Uncle Fred. I was overwhelmed and it gave me a love of lego that i still have to this day.

It made lots of models that, for the time, were very realistic. The landrover/ boat/ trailer was my favourite, and the truck / helicopter were good also.

I still make models with this set, and have one sitting on my desk right now 29 years later. Value for money doesn't get any better than this. Thanks Fred, and thanks lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"workinblack","2016-10-24T13:14:59.257Z","Like many, my first Lego set","<p>I begged my mum to buy this set. And even though we didn&#39;t have the money for it she did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played with this set&nbsp;every day for years on end. The truck was my favourite, along with the bus. The bus you say? But it&#39;s&nbsp;not in the instructions!</p>

<p>That&#39;s&nbsp;right. The old Lego sets had pictures of other models you could build on the box and on the back pages of the manual. These fuelled my imagination. I would sit there with a magnifying glass trying to work out which pieces were which and&nbsp;what sizes they were, trying to determine any lines in the row of bricks which would indicate a brick&#39;s length.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So much of Lego these days are of actual models. That&#39;s not a criticism as I love their sets. But it&#39;d&nbsp;be great to see some new Universal Building Sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set got me hooked onto Lego. And I have my mum&#39;s sacrifice to thank for it.&nbsp;</p>
