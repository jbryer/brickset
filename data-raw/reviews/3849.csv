"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T09:56:07Z","Much better than those trikes","Wow this motorcycle makes the classic ones looking very slow and weak. It's really sporty looking. I bought two of these, because I wanted one for future MOCs. The only bad thing is that it's extremely out to scale with the older sets and some of the new City Sets. It's just a bit too big and so it looks slightly like an Evil 4Juniors set.
But these bikes will take some more speed and realism bring into the City-Theme. It's just a good 7/10 to me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Despite trepidation because of the one piece 'shell' I'm very pleased with 7235.  Yes, its a lot bigger than the old 2 wheeled cycle, but it does fit in well with the new City size sets Lego are releasing (4wide cars, 6 wide trucks), and its also the cheapest way to get your hands on some of the new slope pieces too.

But it's not completely ready-made, and it's &quot;accessorized&quot; quite nicely. I'm annoyed, as always, by the stickers though. Why can't 'police' be printed on? I'm never happy with stickers.

Firstly It is accurate size! Motorcycles aren't that small especially higher cc ones. I'm from Australia and here it looks like our bikes. As someone mentioned before the Honda Gold wing. Have a look at one its a beast designed for comfortable cruzin'.

The new accessories and lights are cool. Not as buildable as id hoped but what can you do? The one thing I hate is the stickers. I'm pedantic about them being straight central. why cant they just print them on the pieces :(

I was glad to find out that there was some building to do and that I could change it if I wanted to.  It comes with stickers that I probably won't use.  I think it looks cooler without them.  This baby actually works.  It rolls and sets up on its own with kickstands. It doesn't turn really sharp, but the tires have pretty good grip.  There is even room for another guy on the back (if you have another helmet!) The guy looks like the guys from the Fire Station except he is wearing a black jacket with a zipper and a Police badge.

If you get tired of the Police Motorcycle, it can become a motor bike/scooter.  It turns sharper that way without all the extra body on there.    The kickstands are cool because they can go up and down like a real kickstand.  The pilot from my A-Wing Fighter 6207 is doing extreme stunts on it in dirt bike/scooter mode right now.

A ""modern"" bike frame;
White (AND wide!) motorcycle fairing;
Police officer minifig (which looks quite special, mind you);
A walkie-talkie & a decent amount of lights.

All in all, it's worth every last penny, especially if you're a fan of bikes or want to add to your police fleet. The decals are stickers and not printed and they come in a ""generic"" (black background, white font) and ""German"" (green background, white font) version.

The bike itself bears a striking resemblance to BMW R110RT, not least because of its extra-wide fairing (common with all boxer engines and BMW bikes in general). By the way, the modified version of the above (the BMW 1100 RT-P) forms a big chunk of the German Police bike fleet.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>The Minifig:</h4>
<p>A nice police figure with sunglasses and a helmet. I replaced his gloves with yellow hands as I like my police force to all have yellow hands. He has the standard police pilot/ bike rider torso and black legs.</p>

"BrickTVReviews","2011-06-28T09:01:05.313Z","Why Is My Local Store Stocking Up Black Stickered Versions?","<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Hello again and recently I bought this mini impulse set today and I thought I'll make a review of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set comes with one figure and a small police motorcycle. the box is different compared to today City boxarts. there are the same picture on each side of the box where now he have the set's picture on one side and action scenes on the other side. On this set there is only 1 action scene which is on the top of the box showing a actor's hand changing the stickers on the motorcycle from English to the included German ""POLIZEI"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When opening the box out comes the MC's frame and cover, one bag , one instruction leaflet and one DSS. Shame on LEGO they did this set too juniorised but I forgive it because there are small chances of designing a brickbuilt MC. The DSS a.k.a Dreaded Sticker Shhet has 6 stickers: 3 black english ""POLICE"" and 3 green German ""POLIZEI"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts are rare but they are juniorised, the Technic vertical 'T' clip acts as stands for the bike. The walkie talkie is getting a bit too common in City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure's face is rare. So far in City I only remembered it in here and the 2008 Special Edition ""7723 Police Pontoon Plane"". The torso is a new [at least at the time of it's release] Police motor jacket with belt. So far no back printing. Another helmet appears again too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build is simple to juniorisation. Putting in the Technic vertical 'T' piece and adding frames and cover and bingo! You, my friend has the motorcycle without wheels and lights and stuff. But it is entertainning and heart stopping for those who wanted this set so much&nbsp;or recently found after searching for a long time like me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The finished set is great. It has the <strong>sleek</strong> <em>aerodynamic style to it.</em> It is not long however. And with the included stands you can display this without fearing it would fall down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No <strong>Story Corner </strong>this time but I have to say that my store stocks the original 2005 version, pity....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this is a great set, good to expand your police force for a great deal in price.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,5

<p>The lego 7235 Police Motercycle is pretty amazing. I recieved this set from my Aunt last Christmas along with many other police sets. This set was very easy to build. It was also quite fun. This set doesn't have many parts, but the parts it has are very nice. This set is fun to play with but it doesn't feel right to just have a police motercycle patrolling the city alone without a base, so I reccomend getting a police station or the mobile command center to go with it. I think this set is worth the money and that you should really get it while it is still available. Overall, I give this set 4.9 stars.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5

Hi, our names are Connor, Harry and Harry and we are professional Lego reviewers. We have been reviewing for 4 years now and we have had a lot of good feedback. we also have a youtube channel - Mrconnor2000 - so check that out and please rate this review a 5 bricks out've five!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box was very simple with one main image on the front and three smaller images on the back showing different angles of the bike and also the instructions were english but it came with a dutch version too.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There were'nt many parts in this set but it did include one Minifigure and a few accesories!</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set included one minifigure which was a poiceman. He had a white helmet with a visor on, a face with a smirk and black glasses, the 2007 police torso and black pants. he holds a walkie talkie or you can clip it onto the back of the police motorbike.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very simple and it took about 5 minutes to build. It came with a page of instructions which are instructions you usually find in a polybag.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks very realistic to a real police motorbike and it looks very well in a dark colour which in this case - is black. you can get a blue one with the 2008 police station. If there was one thing we would complain about this set - it would be that it has.......Stickers! It comes with two black stickers that say 'police' on them and they are on the side of the Police Motorbike. Apart from that its an Awesome&nbsp;set.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>We think this is a great set and anyone and everyone should buy it for an add-on to your police station if you need more vehicles. Thankyou for Reading.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
