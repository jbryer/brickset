need 9 #4589 black cones -instead of 8
need 4 #3021 blue 2x3 plates -instead of 3
need 2 #3794 blue modified plates -not listed
Printable step-by-step instructions can be found at www.legoat.com  
Click on &quot;original models&quot; and this set is on page 5.
As someone trying to complete the classic space collection this was a labor of love, but I figured I would share this info with everyone else.  This set can be done at a reasonable price buying loose parts on Bricklink and then printing the above referenced instructions.  I think I spent about $20.   Happy building!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
