"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-21T11:01:41Z","Small and detailed","This is a very nice set. LEGO is really coming along well from the juniorized age. For some reason the style of this set is exactly like 6600. The only drawback from this set is that it doesn't have doors. Also, this is probably the cheapest way to get the 1x1 slope pieces and the new wheel covers. Lastly, this is not a World City set, it goes back to the City theme. Even on the box, it is &quot;City&quot; not World City",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-22T05:38:15Z","Great, but...","This set looks pretty cool, the white suits the police theme much better than the black, and it's a more realistic looking squad car than the World City version. The fenders on the car look a bit... big, but it looks sleek all the same. Unfortuantly, the biggest problem lies with the brand name. LEGO start making World City sets, which I love, and then they cut them off unexpectedly with these new City sets. Why can't LEGO just have one town theme?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The new car base seems to be slightly juniorized, but it's a cheap way to get those new pieces like the transparent slopes or the bumpers.Too bad that there aren't doors included. but It deserves an 8/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-07T17:06:44Z","Nothing in comparison with old town system","I think that these new sets are bads in comparison with the old sets. There are not doors, no hinged roof; the wheels are too big for a small car, and the wheel covers look terrible. Definitively I prefer the old cars, with the small wheels for the sedan cars, and the nice opening doors and the opening roof to take out easily the mini figure. ",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-13T22:42:47Z","Great little set","It was cheap, had new parts, and I couldn't let the motocycle cop do all the work.

Pros:
New lights, new fenders, classic uniform and hat, smoke tinted windows, roof.

Cons:
No doors, has stickers, where do I put the radar gun?

There are too many unique peices which make it hard to build something else with the supplied parts. However it is a great way to get the new bits without spending heaps of cash.

Overall it is a great little car. Looks perfect next to the new bike.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-25T09:30:04Z","on the rebound","Thank goodness that Lego is bringing out more 'contemporary' sets.  This looks much better than any car in the past 5-6 years and with good, usable new parts.

Finally, a 'car' in real life proportions, (not quite to minifig scale) but an actual car.  The wheels look huge but at least a car can now fit those 1991/1992 rubber without looking ridiculous.  The fenders are a nice touch, especially when this design trend has been around for a decade (think Audi TT, SUV's, Ford Focus, etc.)

I wish townsfolk and 'regular Town sets' do appear again though.

"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-10T13:01:29.197Z","Great car!","I've have had some time without buying legos.. but when i saw the new city sets i decided to collect them all again! the police car is great! new pieces and the new car style is great! i gotta buy some more for my city! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-13T11:38:19.89Z","Far from perfect, but good enough","Gone are the blocky cars of yesteryear, in comes this new, more streamlined version for the 21st century. The design of the car is definitely a great step forward, introducing a bulkier, curvier look which looks far more up-to-date and stable than older Lego cars. Unfortunately, this comes at a price: the doors are unmovable bricks and the traditional hinging roof is no more. Instead, the front windhield and roof are only connected to the rest of the car by two studs in front of the steering wheel, making them easy to remove. It works, but it's still a step back.

When assembled, the car looks surprisingly sleek and elongated, moreso than the box woould indicate; yet at the' same time, the proportions don't seem quite right. Maybe this is caused by the large rear windows, maybe by the short tunk. A sticker sheet is included for all the police markings, in both an English version on a black background and a German version on a green background, much like the real-life German Polizei markings. All stickers are limited to one brick, meaning the model can be disassembled without breaking them.

One thing notable about this set is that the instructions are, at some points, a bit confusing. Thanks to this being a small model, it's not a big problem to ge back a step or two to fix mistakes, but certain portions could have been clearer.

Thankfully, the set redeems itself in the extras. The police figure had a crisp and detailed uniform, a speed camera and the classic walkie-talkie. While I understand the equipment couldn't possibly be stored in the car, it would have been nice to at least have room for the walkie-talkie.

Overall, the set could have been better, but the low price and interesting parts make it worth buying...just.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"David1985","2006-07-09T16:08:34Z","Great Set","I would give this set an 8 out of 10.  It is a great car, but sould be $4 and not $5.  Some of the new pieces, the one in the from and the back with the lights, annoy me because they are useless and other pieces could have been used.  otherwise the newer pieves look good with the set.  But once again there are no doors.  Lego needs to bring back the car door in its sets.  But it is a much buy, more so it you can find it onsale.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mvrlego","2005-12-28T09:21:18Z","This is a very nice set","A new way of thinking for Lego. Very nice. I do think that the new models need the doors and hinged roof. This is the norm in all the new fire and police vechiles for 2005. Lego should bring these features back. Very nice addition for 7237 Police Station. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the new fenders, the speedtrap, the mini figure is decent. A good set at a great price.

This police car is simply...nice. It comes with an officer and speed radar. That's it. Overall, good price and good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Loganwan","2008-04-12T17:04:08.123Z","Speed Trap","I like this car. It is well designed with slanted front and back windows to give a sporty look to the car.  It there is also a nice bit of room inside the car.  Since the back window is slanted, there is a little shelf behind the driver's compartment.  (Um, seat anyone? What is up with seatless cars as of late?)

I am not a huge fan of the design where some of these new vehicles have giant tires that stick out past the wheel wells.  This is similar to the Off-Road Fire Rescue 7942 which has really bad wheels. I am also not a fan of the giant light bar across the top either.  It would be better to have a shorter bar, maybe with a 1x1 clear blue tile on each side instead of the angle pieces Lego is so fond of right now.

It doesn't take up much space and it's only $5.99, even though I had to buy it for $8. It is very easy to build and it brings lots of enjoyment to those who build it. The only flaw is that the officer's stand, or speed gun, won't fit into the back of his car. If the officer also catches a criminal, he has no where to put him!

"McDuff79","2009-04-25T19:50:35.14Z","Well.................","This is my first review, so apologies if it's a bit ropey.

    Anyway, this little ""cheapie"" was my first city purchase (recently had a baby boy, so starting his collection early (ahem) and by all accounts, for the money I think it's a decent little buy.
       BUT 24 hours later I decided it annoyed me and I had to modify it a little, basically, I thought the lightbar sat too high and looked daft, I'm not really a fan of the one block space between the front and rear windows and, tbh the bonnet was a bit long for my liking, also, the kit came with a spare tr-blue and tr-red cheeser's. well it would have been rude not to use them!

pics here.
 http://s176.photobucket.com/albums/w171/DorsetDubs/7236modified/

      So basically I've moved the windscreen forward 1 row and dropped the lightbar in the gap, ontop of the 4x2 that previously lived below the rear screen, that I've replaced with two grey l pieces, which gives the added bonus of freeing up space to store the radio!

      Other than that little change though I like the ""new"" bits that come with this kit (new to me, anyway) the wheelarch pieces I actually quite like, the wheels are robust and fun, but the stickers. oh the stickers. well I guess I can live with them for now.  tbh thought there really was no need for stickers in this kit, printed panels would surely have been easy.

         Oh, and what's with that speed camera/radar thing? pah, straight in the spares bag (except the PRINTED speed reader panel, which is now the cars dashboard!)

         So basically for the couple of quid I payed for it, it's a wicked little, fun, adaptable piece which can kickstart a lego addiction with ease and, as another brickset user said, you can never have too many Police cars! (he says blushing). definately a 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"lotographia","2009-03-25T04:41:23.903Z","Comes in two different flavours.","This is the first set I ever saw with the new mudguard pieces, and I was instantly revolted... that was four years ago. Since then the mudguards have been applied to practically every lego vehicle, and even used for more imaginative things, like for windows in the Cafe Corner. I guess that's when I finally accepted them, when I saw it demonstrated that they could be something OTHER than just mudguards.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-02T11:09:59.34Z","Good … For The Money…","After purchasing and building this set and the 4WD with Horsebox (7635) I am starting to wonder if Lego have ‘rushed’ a few sets to get them on the shelves!   I mean this is a great looking set, but seems to lack a degree of thought.   This has been documented previously by other reviewers, but where is the handheld radio and portable speed camera supposed to be stored when the car is in motion?   Why have Lego started to go for the ‘no doors’ approach to their latest vehicles?   I am hoping to get hold of Prisoner Transport as my next set (7245) which should display nicely with this police car, but again, that set has no cab doors.

Anyway as for this set, you get an attractive little police car, a uniformed Traffic Cop and a portable speed gun with display.   I think the car looks just right, the wheels fit snugly into the wheel arches, simple front bumper with grill and lights, high mounted blue ‘lights’ and twin antennae.   There are also tinted windows and a choice of either German or English graphics (stickers).

I’m really pleased with this set for the money, it looks good on my bookshelf but there are a few flaws with it which I am overlooking as the price was good and I display mine with the police car parked, the officer using the camera with radio in hand ready to contact his colleague waiting further down the road ;o)

Just bought this set, and sure will buy many of it before it goes out of production.
I actualy thnk the stickers is a good thing on this set. I simply didnt mount them, and removed the lightbar from the roof  to get a plain white car for my town.

its a neat police car too, but i prefer a couple of modifications.  If you move the
the windshield, roof, and rear window 1 row forward you get more space to fit equipment on the dashboard. 

I also did another cool modification. I removed the front bumper, and fited the blue lights from the roof in its place, then i used the extra clear blue slope piece as a dashlight inside the car. Makes a real cool unmarked police vehicle for undercover policework in Legotown.

Also makes a great convertible.

The car can only hold one character; there is no extra seat for a captured criminal. There is, however, a little&nbsp;board behind the&nbsp;""seat""&nbsp;to put&nbsp;the walky-talky so the officer doesn't have to hold it while he drives.

I removed this piece and moved the back windshield up a stud, so the car was shut so a burglar couldn't shoot in. There is 2x2 piece in front that states ""Police"". Sadly, there are stickers.</p>
<p>This set is a definitely must have. 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"sf1378","2010-11-30T18:00:17.49Z","Nice little set!","<div><br></div><div>One of the first new sets I got when my Lego bug came back.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>First thing to say is that the 2005/6 version as pictured came with Police/Polizei white lettering on either black for UK/US or green background for Germany whilst the current reissue has both Police/Polizei on a light blue background. No one else has mentioned that...so I have ;)</div><div><br></div><div>Its a nice little set. Very playable and you never can go wrong with emergency services Lego in this small size.</div><div><br></div><div>To my mind, the car is an update of 6623 from 1983 (which I also had as a kid). But then, the city range does have many items that are updates of classic stuff, like the Octan tanker truck, the massive Lego truck etc.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The build is simple, fast and fun.</div><div><br></div><div>My only cons would be that theres nowhere to store the figures walkie-talkie or speed camera and that there aren't doors. Lego could easily modify the model and sell it with doors and printed Police logos and perhaps even have another pair of spare doors with Polizei logos printed on? I'm not really a fan of Lego having stickers but then many early sets from my childhood had stickers like the 6610 Shell Pumps or the 6384 Police Station....</div><div><br></div><div>I think this set compliments well the 8402 red sports car as you can have the Police car chasing it for some crime or another lol. I think that the modifications you can have with the car are cool too-you can change the labels, or reposition the roof/windows etc to create a more saloon car type.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all its a cool set and I am now considering buying another two and using my unused green Polizei stickers on one as a nice variation as I don't really like the all blue/white optional stickers with the current issue whilst the other could be modified to make the car look as mentioned into a saloon Police car...some of the other reviewers have made some pretty helpful suggestions. :)</div><div><br></div><div>Its also impelling me to buy the nifty red sports car as well....lol.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4

"DvE","2011-09-06T17:18:29.37Z","Simpel yet satisfying little police car","<p>This is my first 'normal' lego build/car since my KFOL years and my first review.</p><p>Since it was quite cheap and cheerfull I bought this with some other sets as a nice extra.</p><p>I quite like the fact that the tires look much fatter than in my youth. They need fenders and are sicking out quite nice. They run much smoother too.</p><p>What I don't like is that the doors seem to be gone missing. Nowadays you seem to have to lift the roof to get the guy in the car.&nbsp;</p><p>This also brings me to my second dislike. The roof is only attached to the front window which in turn is only attached to a 2x1 brick. So you're almost dismantling the entire car if you want to get to the minifig. This could have been attached more securely.</p><p>The extra speedcam thing doesn't do it for me. I would have like some more detail on the car instead.</p><p>For kids it seems to me to be a nice little car to drive around. It also has some presence to just put on display.</p><p><br></p>
