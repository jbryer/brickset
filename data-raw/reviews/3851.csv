"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-21T09:39:46Z","Super","I have bought one, this is the way Lego has to go.
More of this sets will be profitable for Lego but not
only police and fire but also normal city sets, like banks, shops, etc.
When Lego introduce this i will buy directly. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-26T12:33:43Z","Looks Good","A list of Pros and Cons....

Pros:
Nice Design
Old School Qualities
A K-9
Very Realistic
Police Don't Smile
Burgler looks evil(not juniorized with smiles)
 
Cons
Needs more Police Minifigs(2)
Needs more jailguys(1)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T20:12:20Z","this police station out does the rest","this police station is way cooler than the older ones of the 90's. With features such as a K9 unit, working flashlight (dunno how that works) and a better helicopter, this set is on the list of ones to buy. Lego is really taking a step in the right direction from the old juniorized ones, and its really paying off. Lile i stated, the helicopter rules. It is way more realistic looking than some of the &quot;attack copters&quot; from yesteryear. Really looking forward when this set comes out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-19T14:13:00Z","wow!","Lego keeps coming up with crappy, not complete, lego sets.  Now it seems they have stopped that trend.  It looks like they combined the world city one with the old one and the jail is huge.  The helicopter looks so real.  The motorcycle rocks and The flashlight is so cool.  You can even take a mugshot.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T01:25:39Z","Not bad...it's worth to buy","I have bought this set last month. This set is very big and has many spaces and rooms and with a nice base plate. The design is also good, at least better than the 7035 in &quot;World City&quot;. There are many nice items in this set also. However the prison van is too small, the jail guy can't be sit in it, so it's better to buy 7245 to substitute the original one. And i don't know why there isn't any gun in this set, not only this set, i think all of the police sets... May be the lego city is too safe or the police is superman (they can capture the crook without gun) great...haha",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-10T15:36:46Z","brilliant set","I bouhgt this set last month and it is really cool.
the moterbike and the helicpoter have really nice designs as well as all the rooms andequipment it comes with.
I would highly recommend buying it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-21T18:10:12Z","waaaaaaaaaaaaay better","i think that this set is the best set so far all the other poilice sets were too stupid and had no practical uses.this set is much better because it has:forensics,interrorgation room,security checkpoint,control tower and mug shot room and it also comes with a cool bike and a &quot;prison van&quot; thats small so i use it as a equipment van and the station does not have too many curvey things+it has a helipad that swings out for a (cool)helicopter to land.and it has tons of lights,sirens e.t.c and it on a platform/rockthing that is new design as well as a prison 
i dont care about stickers unless if there too small. it also has that cool (and powerful)torch thing the only con is the spinney head but it is not that bad once you get used too it


buy it

best big minifig set ever",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mvrlego","2005-12-28T09:31:00Z","A very proud owner","Lego should be proud of this one. Very good detail. Very nice hinged Helipad. The sliding door for the jail is a nice feature too. The base makes a good addition as well. Sticker detail is very good in each room of the set. Vechile has no doors or hinged roof which I think should be brought back. The accesories rack in front of the building should be inside.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chanying13","2006-01-29T21:02:25Z","My first Police Station ","The baseplate is a little bit fragile.  The van and the helicopter could have been better.  More mini-fig.  Stickers is always troubling me, especailly when they are across several bricks.  

However, the detail is funny and the overall outlook is very cool.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pfccypret","2006-11-22T00:17:00Z","Very good set","I really like all the detail here. Maybe not the most realistic design. But it was fun to put together and looks really cool. My only complaints are, the dogs are kind of weird and the my sections seem to come off the base plate fairly easily. But other then that, everything is great. I would recommend this over the police stations that have been out over the last 10 years or so.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-13T01:41:50.187Z","Best police station I've seen offered in last 10 years ! ! !","Like all of my reviews, I do own this set and I'm very proud to say that this one is in my LEGO closet. Santa brought me this two Christmas's ago. My wife and kids laughed about how a grown man can be so excited about another LEGO set. I am a big kid at heart and love LEGO's. This set is awesome, I could get into detail but enough reviews already have done that. Plain and simple if you can find it- buy it you will love the latest Police Station !!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

but there should be one thing.



THE WEAPONS!

a shot gun,and some pistoles would be nice and since lego didnt add these things i will give it a 4/5. get weapons",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Isak","2007-12-27T21:03:06.53Z","I love this set!","I love this set because the jail door actually opens up and you can take the back off the jail so you can play with the bad guys inside the jail cell. In one building there is a magnifying glass you can look through and see the fingerprints actually magnified bigger. The back of the police van opens and closes. For the helicopter, you can push the blades and it spins really good but there is no motor. There are 3 searchlights and they all go up and down and spin around. This is my favorite set of all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-03-18T16:54:15.967Z","Police station? yeah, right.","What a worthless hunk of plastic. The base is unstable, making the middle section of the station collapse all the time. Its weak and un decent, I own it and i do regret it. Its only use is the prison, and as decoration in my ever-growing lego city. Its only good for the prison, the sliding door is different. just don't buy it, unless you just want it for decoration.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-04-30T19:17:57.78Z"," Watch out...criminals have escaped, I repeat criminals have escaped........."," This set is one of the coolest and best sets to play with! I won this set at a Lego store and it was a really lucky day! Here are the cons and pros.....

  Pros

1. The helicopter is really neat and well built.
2. The inside is really cool and it has lots of things to do inside of it.
3. It comes with a motorcycle and a van.
4. It comes with a light-up flashlight.
5. It includes 5 officers, 2 robbers &amp; 2 police dogs.
6. The jail is a pretty good size.
7. The rooftop is really cool to do things like....patrol the area.
 
  Cons

1. Why is the jail outside? Thats weird....
2. The helicopter platform sometimes breaks when you move it to take off. 
3. There are no doors to get to the next room. 

Those are the only cons that really bother me....but this set is awesome and if you have the chance, get this set! Thanks for reading the review and I hope you enjoyed it!

"penguin3332","2008-05-30T20:27:15.39Z","Vehicles !","This is the 2005 police station, it is black, not blue.  It has a cool color combination, along with enough crime fighting tools to suit even the biggest city.  I am breaking it down into four parts:

-Detachable wheel set &amp; tools
-Cool headlights

Jail Van / Dog Van-
-Includes police officer and dog
-Opening back door
-Cool van, made on a car base plate
-Tall

Helicopter-
-Includes police officer
-Opening cockpit with controls
-Space behind officer for either tools or a criminal

Police Building-
-Includes police officer (I did not get one figure), a dog, and two criminals
-Jail has sliding door on one end, and breaking wall on another end
-Has metal detector, mug shot room, confession room, finger print room, and control room
-Bridge to Helicopter stand

Dislikes-

-Not much space in Jail Van
-Helicopter stand is not much
-Mine was missing the equivalent to the light up minifig

Overall, Get this set it has all the police vehicles that you would ever want.

"DevDevBeck","2008-07-04T13:00:22.153Z","best police station so far!","     I got this set at legoland california in august 2007, and i could not wait to build it. I took
an hour or so to build it, and it was very nice. I bought a police car to go with it and with the 
added police car, the police station was much better. I would recomend this set to any city fan, police lover, or just plain anybody who likes legos.This set has at least 42 hours of play on it if you have other buildings, so all in all this is THE perfect set.

The architecture of the Police Station is great, I like the independent jail cell, and all three vehicles are awesome! Awesome set :-)!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2010-01-10T08:26:21.437Z","It's not a police station, it's Alcatras!","So i want you to think about it for a minute.
How would you feel walking in to a place like this? When entering the grounds, the first thing you see is an uotside jail cell where a condemmed prisoner is shouting at you. A police dog is standig outside barking and growling at the prisoner. Then you see the building, that stands atop a big concrete foundation, no plants, trees or anything natural, just cold hard concrete. There's alarm sirens and searchlights evrywhere: You look around and realize that all the windows are dark and foggy, and at the entrance to the building are two big videocameras that watch your every move. As you walk up the long stairway you feel surrounded by cops, and you feel like you are being watched from all sides. The prisoner, only a few metres from you is shouting, and threatening both you and your family, while an officer is yelling back at him, telling him to shut up. When you enter the building you think to your self, ""all this just to pay my parking ticket?!""
I don't know about you, but i would be scared as heck walking up to a place like this.

Anyway, other than the really intimmidating design of the whole thing. it's a nice set. that has some excellent features. It's a great build. The structure is very sturdy, with the exception of the helipad. Instead of being a fixed structure, it has the ability of tipping sideways. I guess it's so that the helicopter can be moved out of the way before the propellars start turning, but i really think it's unnecessary.

As before mentioned there are a lot of searchlights on this station and there are also plenty of other lights on the building to keep the place bright. There is 5 rooms, an entrance hall, a place where the prisoners can be photographed, an office with a fingerprint plate, and a magnifying glass, this room has a little balcony, so the officer can go outside and have some fresh air, then there's another room wich can be used as an office, or a cantina. There are two chairs, and a table with a small lamp on it, so i use it as a cantina. Finally there's the big radar room, where the central computer is located. This room has a view of the intire grounds. There is also the outside prison cell.

Other than that the set comes with a van, a helicopter, and a bike, all of wich are excellent additions. There are lots and lots of accessories (radio's, etc.)

The minifigs are great, 5 people, 4 officers and a prisoner. One of the offiicers hold a working flashlight, activated by pushing down on his head. Finally, there's allso a police dog.

All in all it's not a bad set, it's not my first choice in police stations, i would have liked to get the 7744, but i got this virtually for free, along with a bunch of other great sets. It came from a family, and their children was not interested in Lego's any longer, so i got it for next to nothing. Incredibly enough, this set was complete, no missing pieces, even though it came disassembled in a bag, and a child had owned and played with it. Excellent condition too, i was never that kind to my lego's as a child, hehe. :)

Anyway, i give the set a 4/5, i think it's too intimmidating, and that affects my grade.

"boston_fan_2004","2011-01-10T18:47:13.677Z","This is one heck of a police station ","I got this set for Easter in 2006 and it took me two days to build. After that, I started playing with it and found it to be quite amusing. This was my second city set and it helped me get my city started. It eventually fell apart and I forgot about it for about two years until i got interested in city again. I looked and looked and found the instructions. After that, I digged for the right pieces and finally rebuilt it. It still remains in one piece. I learned a valuable lesson after that which is never take this set apart and forget about it because it may become valuable&nbsp;eventually. I would as well definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good police station.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
