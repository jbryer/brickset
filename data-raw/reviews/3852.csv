Hello!

More Pros and Cons reviews heading your way!

Note: I'm from the U.S. I'm also a newbie to reviews so...take it easy  ;)
------------------------------
REVIEW:
INFO:
Name/Number: 7238 Fire Helicopter
Theme: City (officially; NOT World City)
Pieces: 75

PROs:
-The cockpit is more closed than most other LEGO helicopters (but it is not entirely closed)

CONs:
-Many BIG new custom pieces (Yeeeech!) ie. the rotors, landing skids (-1)
-Bad design and use of pieces makes it look arkward (Why are the blue transparent color &quot;water sprouts&quot; at the end of the &quot;water cannons&quot;?) (-1)
-Occasional use of simple and classic pieces, but it is not streamlined, and therefore blocky; as on the tail) (-1)
-And last, but not least...Stickers...but i'm not taking any points off...since it is so common now-a-days...

And there you have it! This So-so set gets 7 out of 10!...

-2 x 8 piece(well i am buying this set today so....)
-new rotary piece

I cannot take off for the glider becuase it is from Rock Radiers(which was the last good theme before City and World City..)

Pros now since the cons are up there

Pros

Yes the tail rotor can be a one not dual pieces, but this new helicopter is really a nice and i think, not too juniorized helicopter for fight with fire ! I build a little heliport and install it on the roof of new FD station. Yes, this helicopter is nice. And stickers - here passed !

+ old scholl helicopter

"Cashcleaner","2007-03-03T14:14:37.373Z","Excellent addition to my Lego Fire Department","I picked this kit up for less than $20 (CAN) and I believe it's worth every penny.  While I will admit that some parts have been &quot;juniorized&quot; such as the rotor elements and bottom landing rails, it's not a huge issue for me, and I think detracts only marginally from the overall design.  The water cannons at the sides are a great feature, as are the two side storage compartments and accessories.  It's a beautiful kit with a great price for it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-09T01:06:39.7Z","LEGO rocks with the new City sets!","Any LEGO City set made from 2005 to date (2007) is well thought out and are simply awesome. The Fire Helicopter is no exception. It goes well with the entire fire set and is a must for any town or city collector. Little touches like the water cannons on the side of the copter are cool. Great affordable set - protect your town from fire get this copter today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Sky_guardian","2007-09-11T18:45:44.843Z","Good set","This is nice here are my thoughts

1.goes good with the theme
2.comes with hatchet and other assesories
3.minifig
cons:
1.water shooters look fake
2.small

"hustla187","2008-09-16T19:21:55.437Z","Firefighting from the Air","I picked this set when it came out and it was a very good set after I was finished. I like the water cannons on each side and the blue fire piece which are hard to find. The stickers are an annoying part of this set because you have to put them on perfectly, but at least I got them right. This is a nice set and should be part of any Lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-06T21:48:43.513Z","cool helicopter","this is a realy cool set, it looks like a fire helicoptor and fits onto the helicoptor pad i added to my fire station (7240). the helicoptor has lots of cool little details like the lights on the back, the storage compartments and the water guns. the guns are pretty good and move up and down. the rotar on the top is one peice and works pretty well. the only bit that could be better is the cocpit sealing but thats not too bad. the mf is pretty good, he has a cool helmet and head. this is a good set and the only reason i rated 4 out of five is that i just think it could be a bit better design and it just doesnt thrill me that much, but for some im sure its a five ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-08T23:07:38.89Z","Good, Could be better","This set goes great with&nbsp;any fire station. First of all, it comes with a phone, axe, binoculars, water cannons, fire extinguisher and fire fighter. The only problem is that the water cannons fall off too easily, and once the cockpit is closed, it still leaves a gap which exposes the cabin to the exterior. Overall neat set and reasonable price.

"pod120","2009-02-21T18:13:32.497Z","Simply A Good Addition","My Brother received this set for Christmas 2006 from my parents, they must hae known it was the last Fire set we still needed to get. Not a set we play with very much, but simply a good addition to the Fire crew. 

Pros
-Set includes Fireman minifig with helmet
-Copter has 2 Water Blasters that can be positioned at different heights
-Set has Fire equipment including triangular Fire Extinguisher

Cons
-Blue fire pieces seem pointless
-Set has stickers

My friend also has this set and the propellor on his does not spin freely and is very stiff.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TheAviator12","2013-09-28T08:38:27.927Z","Where it all began...","For my first review on Brickset, I saw it fit to review the set where it all began, my first-ever LEGO set, the Fire Helicopter.<div><br></div><div>This set was pretty simple, basically a cockpit, accessory storage, a rotor, and skids. The side water tanks were cool. A little flimsy, but otherwise pretty well done. The pilot was nothing extraordinary, just your average LEGO firefighter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I don't recall much of my playing with this set, as I was 7 years younger than I am now, but I remember &nbsp;liking how the whole thing looked quite realistic, except for the space between the windscreen and the rest if the fuselage.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The price was extremely reasonable. $10 adjusted for inflation and LEGO's recent price hikes (boo, hiss) would result in a set like this costing about $17 USD. I was gifted 2 of this set (not both at the same time) and built both.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, not a bad set. The cons are few and far between, and the price was definitely one of the set's strong points. I would recommend this set to anybody who collects old sets or who wants to build their firefighting force.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading!</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
