"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T18:30:52Z","A Great Start for TLC!","INTRODUCTION:
Hi, everyone! This is my first review on Brickset, so bear with me...

This &quot;City&quot; (NOT World City; even says on the offical box and site) fire truck is a good start for the LEGO Company.

For many years, there has been Town Jr. sets, but now these NEW City sets are the start of more &quot;Golden Years&quot; for TLC (hopefully).  ;)

Well... upon clearing that up (and my own opinions)... let's get on with the review...
----------------------------------
and... the REVIEW:
I'll do a Pros and Cons review...
(***WARNING: This review includes my opinions ... and I'm from the U.S.  ;) ***)

Anyways...

INFO:
Set: 7239
Theme: City (NOT World City)
Year Released: 2005 (although available in 2004)
Name (U.S.): LEGO City Fire Truck 

PROs:
-Not very junorized (although there are no doors and some, and only SOME big pieces)
-The main truck has stabilizers (finally!)
-Includes plenty of fire-fighting tools and minifig accessories (good)
-Space efficent design and to scale (not like some World City sets)
-&quot;Trailer&quot; is detachable and turnable (turns smoothly too)
-The new wheel coverings look good on this vehicle(but it has its downsides; see below)
-Inflatable craft is grey...and the NEW slope brick with &quot;dimples&quot; makes a realistic motor
-Turnable on truck is sturdy, has smooth motion and has no spots where it could hit the main body of the model
-Includes new &quot;chrome silver&quot; fire helmet (but only on one)
-Overall easy to build, good playability, good functionability, nice color scheme, and somewhat streamlined design (it's all good) :D

CONs:
-With current wheel design it is hard to add doors without modifying its original appearance
-Ladder raising/lowering is somewhat frail and delicate... With only a yellow LEGO pole, with no supports what-so-ever, the pole could slip and therefore collasping.(Don't get me wrong...it DOESN'T break or snap.) Along with this pole comes the whole ladder. The functionability of the ladder is limited because it only uses friction between the ridges of a 1x4 Technic gear rack and the weight of the ladder. If it slips...you'll have to put it back on again. But it's less annoying when you get used to it. :)
-There is only one yellow seat included, even though the &quot;cockpit&quot; (in the front) can seat two minifigs
-There are some new bigger, custom pieces, but it doesn't really make a big difference
-The trailer seems unnecessary, but it is a very nice touch to add to the main fire truck model
-And yes it does include stickers...(an old favorite for complaints), but I don't really mind  :D
--&gt; An AFOL won't be as happy with it as a kid from ages 5 to 10 years...and that's when  my -1 comes in...  :(

All in all, a great start for TLC! Keep it up!

It's a great leap for TLC, and as I said before...
the &quot;Golden Years&quot; of LEGO might begin...again...

The new fire torsos are much better designed then the earlier ones of the 90's, and I like that they have re-used the breathing apparatus from the older sets. Although this set is not in the same relm as the old hook-and-ladder truck, this will be a nice addition to my collection, and will provide a good start for modification on this pirticular model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T09:47:06Z","Great Truck","This is a really good looking model. The model is rated 5+, but it's definately not too juniorized. The only two spots are: The base of the ladder seems to be a bit too simple at the beginning and this new base for the firetruck could have made better. But these are my only little complaints on the set. It's rather cheap at 20€.
There are two figures and I like this 6-wide truck. Too bad the truck only fits one figure, but earlier there were some 6-wide trucks that fitted only one figure too. The design reminds me a bit of the old 1991 firetruck, but this is a much nicer design than the older ones. The trailer is nice too, because it has even a small boat. Well the dark blueish gray works good for the base or the dinghy, but where are the old fashioned lifevests?.
Overall a great set, that's truely going back to the roots of LEGO Town Theme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-05T00:46:28Z","Perfect.","This is an absolutely perfect fire truck.  Again; the only new pieces are useful ones; the only juniorized pieces are the ladder (which is standard) and the raft, which only adds to the image, in my opinion.  Two minifigs, one with silver helmet, and a crudload of accessories.  It's sturdy and functional, with many little features, such as an unspooling fire hose, an extendable ladder, a large cargo hold, and more.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-07T17:47:59Z","Nothing in comparison with old town sets","I understand people about the goods commentaries for this sets, only for how the truck looks, but I don't like the new line that lego was released. A fire truck towing a emergency boat??? Maybe a pick up is good for that. A big cab and space only for one mni figure. No doors. The only pro is the style, but not compatible with old lego cars, because the car is 6 studs width vs the 4 studs of the first models. I hope that lego re-release old lego sets as legends like set 6393 where you find excellents trucks, with the essence of Lego town system, with a good look, rigid construction and structure, lots of details and working pieces.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-15T22:22:36Z","Great! Well-Worth Metioning!!","Hello, Brickset vistors! This is my first review, so bear with me!  :-)

I too got this set today at the local toy store.

Well, first off, you gotta love the price!
214 pieces for only $19.99, and that includes 2 minifigures and their accessories too. The piece selection is also good. There are two of the old ladder pieces, lots of storage pieces and boxes, like the flip up doors and the 3 other containers. There are the new wheel covers/mudguards...8 of them!! Along with that, there are two minifigures who have the old fashioned breathing apperatus like the tankk and the breathing mask topped off with a chrome (that's right chrome) helmet! And you just have to see the new firefighters' clothes...they are much better than the older ones...in much more detail. Like many other sets, there are stickers here and they come in two languages: German (I think) and English, but one nice thing is that there are almost no specialized pieces! The only juniorized pieces might be the base of the truck, but in my opinion, the wheel covers are absolutly fine! The wheel coverings are realistic and to scale (at most parts). The con I can think of right now is that the 4 stud wide cab has room for 2 minifigures, but seats only one! Aside from this, this near perfect set is a big step for the LEGO Company in making a strong comeback in LEGO City!

P.S. Look at the new Construction sets! They are great! I already bought the new street sweeper! Works like a charm!

Until next review,

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T16:17:53Z","Great, but mind the gap","I thought that for 12.99 GBP that this was a superb set. The attention to detail is very good and the playability is also good. 

I have not made a model before with the wheel arch bricks and I know many people have a downer on custom parts, but I do not object in principle – in this case I thought they were OK. It’s difficult to work out exactly which way round the rotating rear section is supposed to go when not in use. I wanted to stow it with the sloping bricks to the rear, but the ladder will not work this way round, so I guess it should be the blue lights to the rear. This means the sloping bricks leave a gap in the middle which looks odd – so I have replaced mine with straight bricks which butt up to the raised stabilisers so there is not the odd looking gap. 

I love the way the toolbox fits inside and the other opening stowage compartments and the silver helmet – if a little old fashioned. The trailer and rubber boats are a bonus. I used only the “FIRE” and number stickers for the boat - thinking the others detracted from realism of the model. For looks, playability and value for money this has to rate a maximum score - well done.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T19:01:48Z","Awesome","my favorite Fire set ,great parts.I love those mudguard bricks.The only thing i don&#180;t like is that there are no doors and why can`t you put both figures in the cab? I mean at least this thing is 6 studs wide so it should not ba a problem.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-06T13:28:51Z","not bad","It has some juniorized pieces, but that's not really annoying. The metalcoloured helmet is nice, I think it shall be the same colour for the metal helmets of the vikings later this year. The figs are nice, The guy with the grey beard is the same face from the unknown jedi from the Republic Gunship from 2002. The little boat is nice and can float on water even with a minifig in it.
The only problem: it has stickers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-07-16T17:35:08.73Z","near perfect","Okay I got this thing a few days ago at Walmart. This thing is better than I thought it would be so on to the reveiw.

The main truck This thing deffinatly looks like a good fire truck its about 6-7 bricks wide so it has a bit of touble fitting on older road plates. I found the latter didn't slip and seemed pretty secure the little thing it rotates on can't go 360 degrees but it still can spin pretty far. tough the big storage doors were a bit hard to put in. The main problem is that both fire fighters can't fit in the truck at the same time.
The Trailer plus boat there is nothing really special about the trailer oOne coboard holds a fire extingisher the other is empty?
The boat is cool and looks good and the dark grey means it can be used in naval mocs.

Summary for thirty bucks it is a bit small but it is still good though there is still some empty contanors plus lots or gear (gas mask 2 fire extingushers axe radio life jacket) and a good amount of hose (mine came with two)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2007-02-19T02:35:36.907Z","Excellent fire apparatus","I love this set, absolutely LOVE it!  The Truck is big and bulky, exactly what you'd expect for a Fire Truck.  My favourite parts are the front of the truck with the detailed grille and lights, and rear ladder assembly.  There are also loads of cool details, especially the side storage hatches and accessories.  

My only major complaint is the attached trailer. The boat on top tends to get in the way and is more a distraction than a fun novelty.  Another minor annoyance is that the two minifigs included cannot fit side-by-side in the truck.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"marvinblue007","2007-07-04T05:57:23.78Z","Great Firetruck!","It's a great start to where Lego wants to go. For me the only disappointments were; not being able to seat both firefighters in the cab and not enough room for a second set of breathing apparatus. Also, what's with the cupboard on the ladder module? For a while mine was empty, but then I added a flashlight like the one on the Fire 4WD, so it's not so useless after all!

Having said that, I think the boat trailer and the extra firefighter were great additions. It makes a great addition to my Fire Brigade, it's certainly better to have an extra appliance instead of none at all! 

Worth picking up!

that being the only major flaw, and having all those qualities mentioned in the other reviews, this remains one of the first city sets that showed the lego was back on the right track again!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

every fire department needs a ladder truck although the zodiac is a bit confusing (they did do a good job on it though!). 
the link above takes you to a brickshelf page which does a good job of creating instructions for the alternate model. it seems strange that in this multimedia day and age why lego dont make the alternate model instructions available online. i suppose that this is what lego is all about, giving you an idea and letting you come up with how to get there.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Anyway its not bad having trucks which are 6 wide as that can make them seem larger than the 4 wide cars, unlike in the classics. Could do with some doors though!

But really what takes a point for my example is that it was missing 2 of the 8 blue lights. I have never encountered a lego set with missing parts, so that was very strange and dissapointing!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-12T13:02:07.903Z","realy good fire truck","this is a good set, and everything works wellthe cab has lots of room, but only has one seet and it could fit two. behind the cab it has a door on each side, and a bin in there to store the equipment. the the lader is pretty cool, the base wont turn until the support legs are down, which is pretty good. the ladder will raise up and stay there, although its not supported by much it has never fallen down on me. but to get the ladder down you have to pull out the leaver yourself which would be hard for an adult with bigger fingers. the wheels are alright, a bit small but not to bad, they have some cool peices over top of them and the front of the truck is very detailed. the trailer is ok, it turns smoothly but its hard to make sharp turns with it on. the tralier has some storage compartments on it and the boat has a life jacket, water gun seet steering wheel and a motor on it, i like the boat. also, theres stickers to the set, and a big specialized peice on the botom, but that doesnt bother me too much. this is a realy good set and is definetly worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-13T14:03:02.89Z","The Forerunner of all LEGO CITY Trucks","This set was issued in 2005 when the LEGO CITY series was launched. It is still on sale and people are snapping it up. Before buying it I didn't think it was so popular but now I realize that.

The truck actualy put the basis for LEGO CITY trucks up to now. Sure, later trucks were better designed especially in terms of their frontal part (4 levels instead of 3, small shelter line above the windscreen) but this one is a real forerunner. It set the standard of a 6-stud width which I consider optimum. The cabin is well made though has some disadvantages like absence of doors, low roof etc.

The mechanism of putting the ladder up and fixing it is simple and steady. What I dislike about the ladder is that it is too short. Compared to the truck from the 7945, this one can hardly reach the second floor.

I liked the big striped white doors that open upwards.This compartment makes the whole truck look dumpy. The outriggers are also very well designed, they were by the way borrowed for the truck from the 7945.

The trailer is nice and especially the boat is a nice addition to the set. However, the boat is not attached to the trailer well, it easily comes off.

Another issue to be discussed is the number of minifigs. There are 2 good firemen but the truck can hold only one.

Finally, I think that the box is a bit too large and the set itself is overpriced (214 pieces is even less that the number of pieces at the 7990 or 7991, for instance).

Overall, the set is very good, I'd say excellent. And the fact that it is still available (and as it is announced, it will be for 2010) is very eloquent evidence of its quality.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-14T15:51:20.64Z","Mobile Fire Station…","I actually went to the local Argos to get the Prisoner Transporter (7245) but it was out of stock, but this set wasn’t so I decided to add this to my collection in the hope of getting the Prisoner Transporter on another occasion.   I paid £13.69 for this set and I really cannot fault it for the money I paid for it.   The set is made up of three main parts; each one is discussed below:

The Fire Truck:

As with the other newer City vehicles, this one is also wider than the older sets, and beautifully proportioned.   The truck features a very clean red and white design, with light grey wheel arches.   The simple white grill is high and meets the tinted windscreen.   The cab sadly only seats the one minifig, but the area adjacent to the cab features large opening hatches where emergency supplies can be stored for use in a variety of situations.   Right behind this area are two landing legs which support the vehicle when the extendable ladder is in use.   The design of these legs mean that the ladder base will not rotate unless the legs are extended and in the ‘down’ position, ingenious planning!   The rotating ladder base features brackets for various tools and accessories, a locker and the fire hose which can be uncoiled from the unit.   The two-piece ladder arrangement is fully extendable and comes complete with a ‘bucket’ to enable a fire-fighter to stand in it while tackling the blaze.   The truck is also decorated with blue ‘lights’ and decals which depict the old classic fire symbols.

The Trailer:

The small trailer connects effortlessly to the truck and features just one axle.   There is not much to report about the trailer; it is simply supplied with two lockers for storage of emergency accessories and features a bracket for holding the Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB).   There is no undercarriage supplied with the trailer so it will not stand alone when detached from the main truck, this can of course be modified quite easily.   

The RIB:

It’s nice to receive a RIB with this set, even if it does look a little out of place sat high up on the top of the trailer there.   The RIB is supplied in almost battleship grey, and is decorated with identifying numbers (decals), steering wheel, seat, light bar, outboard motor and life vest.   It’s a great little addition, but it does look out of place.   I am going to come up with a modification whereby a small crane can be added to the trailer to facilitate loading / unloading of the RIB, this should make things a little more realistic.

So overall, an interesting concept of land / sea rescue capabilities, I must admit though that the inclusion of the RIB does make me think this set is more of a mobile fire station and perhaps a cross between fire-service and coastguard?   I could quite easily imagine the RIB being launched for rescue operations or recovery of persons from the water; I mean what fire fighting equipment does the fireman in the RIB have?   Exactly … none!

It’s a still a winning set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2011-09-20T11:51:40.933Z","Fire Truck Review","I finally decided to nab this set while it's still available in the stores for my Town/City collection and grand plans for creating a LEGO City with my daughter. At roughly $22, the piece count ratio, number of minifigures (2) and some of the specialized and hard to find or get pieces such as the ladders are very well worth it for a set like this.<br><br>As far as building the truck went, at first I was wondering where the instructions were going as it didn't seem obvious at first. At about the half way point it's clear the logic in some of the building and design. And what you get is a current, modern vehicle build geared towards a Fire Truck. There are elements of design used in the Police Prisoner Transport truck of side doors that open up so a crate filled with many useful gear for the firemen is stored at. Side ""clips"" for holding a walkie-talkie and other pieces. <br><br>While the back part of the main truck seems blocky with the ladder, the final build is well done and solid. Even the stabilizers that come down to keep the truck still are well done. The trailer hitch could almost be argued as an after thought, but with towing the raft and other storage pieces on it. It too compliments the whole of this set. There are lots of stickers for this set, which you'll either love or hate.<br><br>For those going out, collecting up the City theme and looking towards filling out their Fire Department, this set is a worthy addition to that end. If you're not collecting anything for City and are focused on other Themes, then yeah you can skip this one.<br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5

The Box to put tools on the compartment is also very playable, the ladder is double and the fireman can reach high altitudes to put fire out on legos buildings.<br>A must have!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
