The helecopter usually comes with the hq, not this one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Just look at the similarities!  LEGO is truly taking a step in the right direction - backwards.

PROS:
+ Less stylized pieces; the only new pieces are USEFUL ones, such as the new bumper piece and the 1x1 slopes.
+ Retro set; even the old fire symbol is recycled
+ Four minifigs, $30.
+ Lots of minifig accessories
+ Nice baseplates
CONS:
- Car has no doors
- The pole is awkward and overdone
- The gate is a bit wobbly
- The upper window 'ledge' is awkward

Truly a return to old practices, though.  BUY IT!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T11:45:51Z","Nice Fire Station but Older Stations Still Better","My new World City needed a fire station, so I bought this. The set does have some similarity with 6478, but it's much better and not as juniorized. The set is functional but lacks detail that would have added to the set (bottom office needs a chair, garage needs a rolling door (gate is weak), middle (or 2nd floor) is just a wall without office space, and stairs to the 2nd floor would have been nice). The 3rd floor look-out section is nicely detailed inside with computers, keyboard, and lights; just a little too narrow. I don't mind the pole at all that adds to the playability, and I like the windows, door, and smoked-roof slants. Lastly, the fire truck/car isn't too bad, just lacks doors. A real fire truck with extending ladder would be better. Figs are nice and the set provides a lot of accessories. I like the modular/sectional construction w/separate instructions. But as always, nix the stickers.

Overall, at $30, this sets offers a lot of playability and good pieces making it a good value. I would probably buy again but still prefer the 80s stations better (like 6382/6385) - but then again, I'm still adjusting to these new, more modern sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

But... I was impressed with the amount of detail included in the set, the price point ($30!!!), and the yellow Castle 
shields to boot!!

Anyway this set is awesome, i did a little reorgainsing like making Fire Car Sets fit on the rooftop, took the alarm sign and put it buy the guy on the bottom level and moved the keyboard on the top over 2 bricks.....

Useful...i bought it cause it reminded me of Ladder 49 the movie...good movie, much inspiration for my city....

LEGO IS AWESOME and i hope the expand this theme with more sets and different minifg faces for each one....like the sad truth that i have 4 beared guys(oh man!)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"pod120","2009-02-21T18:47:42.903Z","We Would Be Going To The Fire, But We Don't Know Where It Is","I think this set is great. I like how it has a Reception Area, Control Tower and Carport. It is well spaced out and not too large and ugly like the 7945 Fire Station. I really like the little wagon and I was lucky enough to get this as Christmas present in 2006

Pros
-Works well with sets 7238, 7241 and 7239
-Includes lots of great accessories including Gas Mask Equipment and Megaphone
-Includes Slide Pole
-Includes Control Tower, Reception Area and Carport with gate
-Set includes Fire Wagon that fits in carport
-Great Price, 50 Dollars AUD

Cons
-Set has stickers
-Is Slide Pole meant to work Manually or Automatically?
-Ladder is difficult for the firemen to transport",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"visualbasic","2010-07-31T16:42:20.107Z","It Is An Okay Station","<p>This is a pretty average set to me. I was a bit disappointed by it .. and I can't I would recommend it. Look for another fire station for your lego city.</p>
<p><b>The good things about this set</b>: lots of accessories, comes with a nice baseplate, plenty of pieces making building this set fun.</p>
<p><b>The bad things</b>: it falls apart way way waaaay to easily, the poor excuse of a &quot;gate&quot;, extremely simple design. What bothers me the most is how easily this thing comes apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see this set going for 100+ on ebay, I would definitely not pay anything past 40 for this set.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,1,3
"boost__7","2011-07-21T09:45:54.413Z","Good but just not big enough...","Hmm is all i think when i look at this set. its just not big enough, especially in comparison to previous fire stations, like the one of 1990 that one was really good even though its quite old now, and this one just doesnt match up to it......Now onto what you actually get: Its a basic f.station with a open parking space for the firecar, which has a gate on the front which is weak and needs extra support as it falls off easily, then theres the entrance area which has a man on a computer then theres on the second floor just a 6x6 brick with the fire emblem and a couple of little fire emblems. then at the top is a response office area with city map, computers, etc etc...and then to the right of the main building is a.....i guess a chute for the firemen to get down. Then theres the minifigs:i would say that 3 is ok and xtra would have been good, you get a fire chief with silver hat, the firecar driver, then a fireman in the entrance hall.Vehicle: its a nice little car with a tap at the back and im guessing theres meant to be a water tank so it can fight small fires and its got a radio and axe on the side along with a couple of storage compartments. I guess thats all there is to say about this one, its ok for the price or if you just want a little fire hq but if you want a decent fire station i say get number 7945 cos its bigger, more vehicles, etc etc. So i hope this helped and bye for now :D<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
