"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T10:16:52Z","Recalls Memories","This set recalls memories of the old fire chief cars from the 80s to mid-90s. It's really good looking, but there are two oddities. First the model isn't correctly in Proportion for the minifig, because the windshield is too small and the wheels look too big. But there's a classic 2x2 Fire Tile, which is an older piece. It's even preprinted and so I come to an 8/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Thinking about the prizes of older sets it was the last years not common they made more then one canon set below the 5 euro. But this is one of them and it is a nice set with a nice fig.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-12T09:44:47Z","Very good","I bought this set today, and I like it very much. It is a great model, but there are some &quot;flaws&quot;: new ugly gray colors, no doors and a brick with a clip. But everything else is very good. I think I'm going to buy three more copie of this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-12T21:54:51Z","$2.99 discount at Toys-R-Us.....","i bought 3 in a Toys-R-Us in NJ...(i live close to the state and we went over to it today....)

i built it similar to the directions becuase the back thing is VERY ULGY and ANOYING!!!

very good value for $4 or 2.99, wherever you get it....

the only thing that sucks is that i bought it conjuction with the fire station and now i have 4 duplicates of the same guy...oh well i am sure there is some faces in my collection of heads and bodies and ect. that will make some decent replacements....


ok overall this set is great and I now making a reivew for the Fire Station...
THE VERDICT: Buy many and make a clan of firemen with axes and waterguns...GO CITY!!!!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-12T10:49:53Z","Nice little set","It has similarities with previous fire chief cars of the 80's 90's. But when the fig is in it it looks like a 12 V battery powered children's ride on replica car (Big wheels, low windshield). But  1x1 trans blue and yellow slope parts and the tile with fire logo are pros of this set. The fig is nice too. Plus you get a fire extinguisher too :) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"robuko","2008-04-17T09:54:59.11Z","lovely balance","The model itself is good, but it has excellent modding potential.  If you take the annoying light thing off the back and roll the car off a higher surface, it almost always lands on its wheels.  That's the sort of stunt skills that can get a fire chief promoted.  The grill looks a lot better when you take the 2 1x2 grills and hang them vertically at the front.  The 2x2 fire plate is printed, not a sticker. 2 each red, yellow and blue transparent pieces.  Amazing value at &#165;390, and a bonus point because the fire chief looks like my dad. 9/10 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It has cool little light pieces and a 2x2 Fire emblem tile. Includes a fire extinguisher, axe and windshield, unlike the fire chief car from the 80's. Where are the seats/chairs in the newer LEGO sets? Like many of the other newer LEGO vehicles, this set doesn't have a chair for your figure to sit in. However the windshield is too small when the fire fighter sits in the car (like other reviewers have mentioned). The set is a steal for the price however.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Cheap
Cute (do you get what I mean?)
No stickers
Fire symbol is a printed piece
Nice axe

Cons:
Wheel is too big compared to the body of the car

I recommend this set to newbie, or those of you who want to build a fire brigade.

"mike2008","2008-03-18T17:48:58.013Z","The basic set for any fire theme ","This is a great set. Think of the fire chief arriving first to any rescue/fire scene in order to give first aid, command and assist in putting the fire out. The set contains the fire chief minifig along with fire extinguisher and axe. Since this set is not to be found within any other fire set. I will recommend buying it. 

pros: a great basic fire set
      Chief fireman with fire extinguisher and an axe
      Nice design not to be found in any other fire set.

cons: no radio communicator!

For &#163;2.99 you get a small car, a decent minifig and some tools.
The car is good, my only complaint being the ominous gap underneath, creating a monster-truck like impression.
The minifig is nice (and has good detail). The tools all fit nicely into the car.

-Axe is different colour to other fire axes in sets 7238, 7239 and 7240

"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-14T16:03:09.763Z","A car or a 4WD?","I don't really understand why this set is called a ""Fire car"". Probably in order to differentiate it from the 7942?

This is a typical off-road vehicle. If it was a car, it should have had smaller wheels that are not almost used any longer. So, this is an SUV.

As for the design, I think it's nothing oustanding. The 4WD repeats much the famous 6525 but is worse. The oldest brother has certainly a better look. That's why I give this set only 4.

However, the set is small but not empty. A 4WD + one man + accessories, all together at a moderate price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The Fire Car here to the rescue!","To get this review started i'd like to point out that where i live this set cost about 14 Belize Dollars (7 U.S Dollars). Its a nice price, if you see money grows on trees. Its quite small but eh its nice. The playability with this set is quite nice, but not on its own. It's nice to have a nice fire station or a house with fire. The parts were nice, I have indeed ran out of those hose nozells, and the building experience, to be honest i&nbsp; built it in a vehicle at night in the dark beside some weird dude staring at me while i was building it so im not sure but its nice and kinda fast.

"alosx","2009-07-28T17:13:10.56Z","small but efective","This is a reminder of fire chief cars of the early nineties. Detailes have changed (wider wheels, lower windscreen), but the concept is the same: small cheap set with lots of playability! This (not the old one, that my friends did have) was the first lego set, that gave me proper lego wheels. 

pros:
cheap
very easy to build and modify!

cons:
minifig. If it would have been a little bit more average citizen, not the fire chief, it would have been easyer to link with other sets. 

conc: Love it, it has a sentimental value to me, it should have a monetary value for you, because, it is a cheap way to get some wheels. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I knew the set was basic, but it’s really very good, and for the money well worth every penny!   The Fire ‘Car’ is more like an off-road vehicle which would be more than capable of attending an incident anywhere a small jeep could get to … literally.   Good ground clearance, open-top and complete with a roll-bar with ‘lights’ make this a great little set.   There is also a small fire extinguisher and axe; these have dedicated storage areas in the vehicle, unlike some of the latest larger sets which cannot accommodate all the accessories provided.   The fireman comes complete with his pressed uniform and white helmet, and by the look of that moustache and beard has been out in the sticks fighting fires or rescuing people for a few days.

A really cheap addition to any City scene or diorama.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Firox_5000","2010-10-03T17:39:33.753Z","Not bad little car","<p>I bought this set in 2005 when it was brand new. The set contains a fire chief , the car and some acceseries such as an axe and fire extinguiser. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ca doesn't take long to build ,probably no longer than 10 minutes and contains a few unique parts back then which are no very common in sets. these in clude the triangle light and transparent blue pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design is not bad the wheels are a little bit too big compared to the rest of the car but I suppose it makes the car more able to go through the rugged roads to the resque.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is quite playable you can go to the fire. but when you add other sets e.g fire station the set becomes much more interesting and there is more oyu can do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money £2.99 is very good value for money. The set howevere has gone up since to £3.99 which is not bad , but shouldn't really be any more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you bought this set a long time ago then you made the right choice and saved some money. if you still dont have it try and look around and if youre lucky you may find some stores still selling it at £.3.49 or even £2.99,</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5

"coldcomfort","2011-01-10T02:52:21.877Z","7241 Fire Car - Increase the flexibility of your City's first responders for cheap!","I bought this set last week on an online auction site and paid a little over $5 USD for it. I think I got a lot for my money. Recently I bought a nice assortment of Lego's base line, inexpensive ""impulse"" sets. The more I look at them, the more satisfied with them I become and the more I think that these kits represent the best value in the brand.<br><br>This particular kit is very cool in my opinion. You get a minifigure that only appears in one other set (the 7240 Fire Station from 2005) and what I consider to be a well designed and pretty versatile vehicle.<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>While the build certainly isn't complicated and doesn't take very long, it is a lot of FUN.<br></li><li>If you already have a good complement of fire/rescue vehicles for your City, this vehicle can be very easily altered to be a regular 4WD. I could be wrong, but I think almost everybody's collection can use a few more street vehicles and if nothing else you've got one here.<br></li><li>This set is a good value at around $5 USD. Getting both a decent sized vehicle (4x8) and a minifigure at this price is hard to argue with.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This is the part where a lot of folks talk about how easy the set was to build or how little was included in the box, but I have to ask everybody honestly, what do you expect? This is everything I could want from a set like this - especially at the price.<br></li></ul>
<p>If you enjoy the Firefighter aspect of the Lego City theme, I think this set is a must have. If your fire/rescue crew is already well established with, say, the Off Road Fire Truck (7213) or even the Fire Station (7208) itself this vehicle will fit in fantastically and give your Fire Chief his own vehicle to race to the scene in. If you haven't bought any fire/rescue personnel for your City yet, this is a great place to start. Bottom line, I think everybody that collects City sets should have one of these - and at the price we can currently get them at I may just buy another.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"brickboyg","2011-02-09T07:35:29.36Z","More Cons than Pros","Figures:

Fireman: nothing special, nothing new.

Pros:

1. The fire extinguisher is quite good(but is two bricks rather than one), but I cannot find anything else to put on my pros list(Though Lego Fire collectors may disagree).

Cons:

1. I think LEGO should of gone to a bit more trouble to make the car(or is it a truck?)more realistic.

2. For me the wheels on the fire car are too big compared to the size of the vehicle.

3. Might of pushed my overall rating up to a two if the fireman's hat was silver, rather than white.
