This is it!!  :D  Along with the new fire-truck (that I also reviewed), this is one of the best LEGO City sets I've seen in years! I'm really glad that LEGO is going back to the basics. There has only been two releases of street sweepers in the past...here's another one to add to that list: set 7242

INFO: 
set #: 7242
pieces: 63
price (LEGO S@H): $4.99 (USD)

REVIEW:
Pro:
-Nice accesories (there is a brown brush, and yes, a BLACK shovel, which is such a novelty since most of the recent sets have grey shovels)
-Not at all juniorized (unlike the recent City sets, the wheel design is simliar to the older Town sets, therefore, it is easy to modify the model to have opening doors, although you have to modify the &quot;hose&quot; design in order for the doors to open fully)
-Good design at a good price (the back of the sweeper is built from two yellow corner roof bricks. The hose lowering mechanism is good. The brush is the simple and classic design...all this for a great price)

Con:
-The minifig's face is weird...this face is a combination between the old mustache face with a new twist (bad, bad). Gosh, this is an opinion, so I'm not taking any points off.

---------------------------------------------------------

This set is now available at LEGO Shop at Home in the US! I just got mine today, and right after building it, I wrote this review, hope this helps!

The other &quot;construction&quot; City sets will ship in late February or early March.

This one is very nice, using those rare car-wash brushed as the sweep-axil, and using some nice other pieces as well like the box-office window as the shield and a nice minifig! It use4s ome nice equipment like the suction duct in the back and an extinquisher thing on the very back. The new sets are lucky charms, they are awesome, and I cant wait for the new Star Wars Clone Turbo Tank to come out...........whos with me!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

One bad thing: it uses the new hinged plates, and I don't like those.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-21T06:04:11Z","Recalls memories","I just bought this along with 7244, 7246 and 7249 at LEGOLAND Germany. Now to the review: This street sweeper has appeared twice in the past, but I must say this is the best design of all the street sweepers. There are many details packed in this little set. Like the tank, the vacuum and the front sweeper, which has more moving ability then those in the older ones. Tools are on both sides of the cab. There's even a black shovel, which seems to be rare, or am I wrong? The minifig is untended looking. He's got a ugly face with the fat moustache and the three day beard. And the cab is missing doors, but this can be modified easily.
So this is a good 9/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"daanton","2005-06-26T12:58:57Z","Good looking set!","Reminds me of 6649, released in 1995, but was unfortunately available only from Shop@Home (I did buy it, by the way, glad I did)... now why do I get the feeling this set will follow the same fate?

Pros:
*Nice minifigs and pieces
*Shuvel and brush piece

Cons:
* Could been more in (maybe a bin or something)

It looks great is unique has a cool looking mini figure and is a LEGO exclusive so unless you are into LEGO's many people will or have never seen this set. It is a homerun for the latest City theme.

I seems weird, and has that unfinished look that is synonymous with other world-city type sets. I like city, and the new city sets are cool, but this one is just plain hard to place. 

Pros:
tools: shovel and broom

The minifig is a really cool and unique one. I also was interested with the blue sponges and they turned out to be a big suprise. The set can be used universally in the lego city theme old and new and is worth the price. I rate the set a 9/10 and say that you get it before it is discontinued.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T23:37:23.56Z","First City set","This was my first LEGO City set and I liked it very much. I first saw it in the summer 2005 catalogue. It includes a minifig, broom, shovel, vacuum, water tank and working brushes that actually spin. The only problem was that the hose is too short and keeps on pulling itself upwards. That can easily be fixed by placing a 1x3 brick under it. Overall great set and worth the buy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Wiseman_2","2008-09-07T07:01:43.42Z","Yes, it brings back memories...","When I was a kid one of the stand out sets of the town line that I remember was the Street Sweeper. One of the few sets not to succumb to over-juniorisation. So when I saw this, naturally, I had to get it.

It is a nice update of an old favourite, incorporating some more modern pieces (and the gas tank on the back is brilliant!) to finish it. The minfig is nice and much more detailed than the one I remember I used to have (a bland smily face).
It also comes with some nice tools to complete it.

Overall, one of the best small city sets I've seen in a long time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"trumpet4751","2008-06-30T14:40:58.153Z","One of the Best","I built this set the second I had the chance. For such a small set it's one of the best Lego sets I own. First, the overall look is great, and you immediately recognize it as a street sweeper. The minifig and tools are perfect for the set.The brush real turns, and I especially like the tank on the back. The vaccuum is cool and doesn't fall off. It's a great set for any age builder, and an essential to any Lego town!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DevDevBeck","2009-06-09T23:23:20.577Z","An excellent Modern lego set!","The LEGO city Street Sweeper is a great addition to any LEGO city. It includes a few special parts and an exclusive head. ( I don't know why I have 6 of them)

The Sweeper has a Blue Spinner on the front, which doesn't spin very easily, but it does spin. There is some window plastic, and some lights on the top of the canopy and on the front of the sweeper. Stored on the right side is a Black shovel, which is rare because most shovels are Grey. On the left side, there is a brown broom, which the Minifig is holding in the picture above. The tires are the small kind which are (In my opinion) are better than the clunky ones. There is a pressurized tank on the back of the Sweeper, and a contraption that comes off the side and appears to be a fan. It's been a while since I've seen that hose piece.

The Mini figure is nothing special, just a regular mini figure. I think it is an exclusive head, though. His torso is an orange jacket with white stripes and a blue undershirt. He seems to be wearing blue jeans. I also named him Jose, because of the old janitor at my school and he reminds me of him.

I don't think this set is available anymore, but if it is, you should get it. If you just want a decent vehicle for your city, get this and do yourself a favor. (Overall Score: 5 of 5)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-25T09:27:41.95Z","Your streets can now be spick and span!","I overlooked the street sweeper and found it to be one of the best vehicle you'll ever want on your streets. It potrays modern street sweeping technology with a hunkering vacuum cleaner at the back with a pressure pump. Or you could be like my friend who bought two of these and used the brushes to create a car wash. Either way, you'll find this set a good investment for you Lego town.

"pod120","2009-02-21T05:57:05.793Z","Good To Have Something Different","This is one of my favourite small Lego City sets, I got this in August 2006. I feel sort of lucky to have this set for two reasons
1-It was the last one at the shop when I got it.
2-The blue sweepers were defects that were almost clear instead of blue.
Many of my Friends and Family also like this set.

-Includes Builder minifig with Constuction helmet
-Includes Broom, Shovel and Air Tank
-Includes Mounted Suction Hose

"HQuiff","2009-03-23T12:51:51.31Z","A Legend!","This set was given to me by my brothers after they came back from a trip, I was delighted to get it and immediately set down to build it! It took about 15 minutes,  and it was fun! Everything was packed up together and it looked like lovely!
The main function is the sweeper at the front that work perfectly when you move it. The wheels I can't actually complain about, I thought they wer egoing to be to small and the whole thing would dwarf it, but really, they stand out and arent's dwarfed at all! And if you thought it couldn't get any better, you were wrong! Well firstly as a good added bit to the set, you can take off like a hover thing at the side and get the minifig to vacuum up (Please note that if the minifig isn't standing on a lego board he just stays in the air). And finally, there's even a place to but all the rubbish at the back! Wicked or what?
Oh, and The Minifig actually has an exclusive head.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-07-11T07:20:10.413Z","Unique City Cleaner","Live in Indonesia for my entire life, I never have a chance to see a car that cleaning the street. Here, what we have to make sure the streets clean is a lot of guys that bring a big broom, and they sweep the street manually. So, when I saw this set for the first time, I can not understand what is the function of it. It is really unique for me, so I want to have one. But sadly at that time, this set is already out of production, so I have no chance to get one for me. <br><br>Luckily, a couple months ago, a friend in LUG Indonesia decided to sell this set, and I bought it.<br><br>The set is really unique, with real sweeper that can rotate in front of the car. I play around with it a long time. Putting some 1x1 bricks and 1x1 round plates acting as trash, and the car really sweep them all. Really nice!<br><br>The car also come with all the tools that needed by a sweeper. A broom, a shovel, even a vacuum cleaner. What I can not understand is the fire extinguisher tube on the back of the car. Can someone explain?<br><br>Love the yellow color, I think it really make this set really stand out in the city sets.<br><br>One minus for this set is the shape of the car. I tried to google street sweeper car, and most of them have a compartment on the back of the car. Probably for storing the garbage they collected during work, but the Lego version doesn't have a storage on the back side, so a minus for realistic design.<br><br>Other than that, this set is really recommended for the city lovers. Lovely yellow color with unique function.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5

It shares not quite the same feeling as the older ones, but if you got the brushes in your hand (and also when you put them in place) you have that kind of flashback not even one of the modern sets provide.
