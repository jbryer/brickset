the pontoons are HUGE @ just over 15&quot;/38cm!!!
peice selection(3x12 wing, new canopies, new engines, trans angled tiles)
It's a floater and comes with one of those little yellow motors.

cons:
a little expensive @ $30 US for 107 peices.
a little more streamlining on the sides of the cockpit would have been nice.
the &quot;cargo&quot; space under the red canopies has no back to them so smaller pieces will slide right out past the engines.

Overall I can only reccomend this set to those who either like the floating sets or have some other plans for those gigantic pontoons. I personally was awestruck by the pontoons at first site. Thoughts immediately ran through my head of what they would look like on the side of some interstellar vessel sailing through a starlit background...

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-22T05:10:33Z","Too big pontoons - nice motor","This is my first non-technic Lego set. I liked everything except the too long pontoons. The problem with long pontoon is that it does not turn itself automatically when put with motor in a sbathtub! A slightly smaller pontoons would have made life much easier (there seems to be a battle :-) some people like big pontoons are don't)

Anyway, the set is nice otherwise. Though the mechanism for starting &amp; stopping the motor would have been better. The motor is really nice though!

The instruction sheet has 'inspiration' for 2 more models. That is, only pictures, no step by step guide. However, with just 107 pieces, inspiration is quite enough.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-21T06:25:43Z","Huge, but rather expensive","Bought this yesterday at LEGOLAND Germany along with 7242, 7246 and 7249. Now the review:
This set is very big and a limited edition, but has a low amount of pieces, which makes it overpriced at the 25€ RRP. Thank god, I got it a little bit cheaper. I really like the motor, which needs only one normal AA battery to work properly. Too bad the motor isn't compactible with the old boats from the 80s and early to mid 90s.  The pontoons are huge and useful if you want to build your own catamarans. There's a big cockpit and engine rooms, but they're all rather empty for keeping the weight low to make them floating through your bathtub or your pool. But it seems to be a little bit too big for the bathtub. The minifigs are nice and the good old livevests are still around, since there are two included. I also noticed some new to me pieces, which have been in the Jack stone sets but they work good for this boat, too
Altough there's juniorization in the boat it's a good 7/10 to me",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-02T04:07:46.467Z","It’s HUGE…","I was lucky enough to pick one of these up recently from eBay for a fantastically low price, in the original box with plans but missing a few pieces, luckily none of them too specialist!   The first thing that struck me about the Octan Speedboat was the sheer size of it – completely out of scale for anything else.   It would simply take over any marina or harbour, but as a display piece somewhere it is great.

The boat features two large hull sections, as in a catamaran design, with the cockpit and engines mounted on a deck which is secured to each hull section.   The hulls are red in colour and feature graphics and a race identification number.   Black decks are secured to each hull section.   The control cockpit is mounted amidships and can house the two Octan minifigs supplied with the set.   Access to the cockpit is via two large opening visors, these are a smoked grey colour and work will with the red and black colour scheme.   The interior of the cockpit features two seats which are well-reclined and various control panels and the main control levers.   Abaft of the cockpit are the storage areas which feature large hatches which swing open allowing access.   Further aft is the huge power plant which consists of the marine engines, various vents as well as air intakes and two jets.   Two black fins situated well aft secure a gantry arrangement which also has vents attached.   Two large whip antennae are also present.   Just below the main engines is a swinging bracket which can clip to the Lego motor which will drive the boat along.

So to sum up, a great set which is bound to generate interest and discussion, just a little (lot) too big for a marina or town setting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
