"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-24T17:45:29Z","A Little Too Simple...","Greetings again!

And to have a jump-start, let's go straight into the reviews!:

INFO:
Name/#: Prisoner Transport 7245
Theme: new &quot;City&quot;


PROs:
-Not many specialized pieces
-The back of the &quot;truck&quot; is roomy (it can easily fit 1-2 more minifigs into the back
-Incudes some interesting details, including the search light on the top, windows with bars, and the 1x1 slopes as lights
-Prisoner/Criminal is good and the police officer has an appropriate face with a nice hat (good...good, like most of the new &quot;City&quot; sets)
-The price is pretty good

CONs:
-The wheel design is not very good (as with most other new &quot;City&quot; vehicles) (-1/2)
-There are supply spaces on the sides, but there are not any minifig accessories(-1/2)
-The back of the truck uses traditional big car doors, but it seem too simple (maybe to cut down on the price?) (-1)

--&gt;Overall design is so-so because it is too simple...
Therefore giving it a 8 out of 10!  ;)

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-08T16:26:00Z","Nice Transporter","I just purchased this set today. It's price is ok at 12,99€ and it's realistic. The doors on the Back are a very old piece which has been used in the 70s as well, but with new colors. The car base could've been made better and It's missing doors for the driver cab. The back of the van is very roomy: It can easily fit 3 or 4 prosoner minifigs. I like the 6-wide construction in all newer trucks and vans, because it makes them better to scale. There are alternate models as well, but some stickers go over multiple pieces, which I don't like so. But if you cut them between the parts they are ok and don't get bad looking. There are 2 Minifigs, which have pretty realistic looks for minifigs. There are even some little details like the search light on top.
All in all it is a 8,5/10 for me, but rounded up to a 9/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-09T14:18:55Z","Prison transport van/bus","This prisoner transport van -uh this isn&#180;t a van this is a bus ! I miss, very very a classic car doors - in world city car door are bun in new city - maybe next ? Very nice and adequate are here a new round fenders. I think a black and white combination is better as this black and panzer grey. But the spot light on the roof and car siren are good. Police officer and arested crook - i hate a sgt. Scarry face and Jack Goldtooth hmpf, in world city are in harbour set two news desperates but in police station and here are only one. Good idea - police/polizei stickers - i prefer US/UK police but in future i can buy too one sets and make a german polizei. + are too old black uniform not a swat or NY in woc. Price is here, in Czech good - probably a 15 euros

"ruidp","2006-12-14T17:15:28Z","Big and empty","This is the first 6 wide car I bought and it is too big. It looks a bit out of scale if you put it in a city layout.
I was used to the old style 4 wide and I was expecting some improvements, bigger car = more details, I thought... Wrong!
It has no doors, the roof doesnt open, the minifg looks small inside, it is very lacking of detail. The construction is juniorized, big pieces, car base, the stickers cover multiple parts (three pieces in the sides) the designers could easily avoid this.
It could have more minifg utensils because it has two compartiments on the sides and nothig to put inside!
Conclusion:
I will not buy more 6 wide cars/ vans.
The minifigs are the best part.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

A unique frame to build off is also nice. The only odd thing was my stickers came as Blue and not Black. I haven't seen Blue on any police vehicles so I am not sure if this is a misprint or intended.

Pro's. 

Easy build
Nice parts
low cost
Roomy rear carrying area.

Cons.

Blue stickers...not really bad though
Roof falls off easy
Rear section can fall apart easy in the hands of a child",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yellow","2008-11-24T15:02:38.373Z","Why blue?","My 6-year-old son just got this set for his nameday. It was around 11,5€ (2990 HUF), which is not bad in Hungary.
The set is great, my son put it together easily. Size is good, however I don't like some elements. First of all I don't like the juniorized elements, such as base of the van, 1x2x2 brick beside the jailbars.
But the worst thing is this set is the sticker-to-brick design. I don't understand why to construct the front of the van of two 3-stud wide slope, and put a sticker with half of it on one slope and half of it on the other ?! Should have been made of three 2-stud wide slopes, or something else, so a sticker sticks only onto one brick. The same with the side of the van; one sticker is designed to be placed onto 4(!) bricks. I simply cut the top and bottom of the sticker and placed it on the long 1x12 brick only (yeah, the stickers are not intended to be placed by a 6-year-old, if you would like to see a good looking Lego, daddy should fix it :))
And one of the biggest question: why has LEGO changed the color scheme of the police sets from black (German green) to uniform blue?! The previous sets my son has (bike and the small car) have black stickers, now the van has blue. Black looks much better! Shame on Lego
Anyway, the set deserves a 4 overall.

Pros:
cool minifigs (especially the bad guy)
roomy van
jailbars
price

Cons:
bad sticker-to-brick design
blue stickers only (?!)
nothing to put in the second compartment (no weapon, no handcuffs)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Lmcfalcon12","2008-12-08T11:58:29.2Z","Augh! What's with the stickers???","Its a great set overall. Cool that the 2 back doors open and that you can fit like 2 or 3 guys in the back. I also like the storage compartments on the sides of the truck.

My only gripe...and its a big one, is sticker placement. The front police sticker on the hood of the car overlaps 2 seperate pieces. This is not the first set like this where if 2 pieces were unclipped, the sticker would rip. Mine did not, but they need to work on piece picking and sticker positions. I don't understand why the front of the truck couldn't have been one sloping 2x6 piece, but that was their choice to pick the two 2x3s. Careful with your stickers and this is a nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I got it as a holiday present in July 2006 from my Dad along with the Police Car. I like that it has a clear window dividing the driver's seat and the robber compartment. This is a great set to add into any part of a Lego City adventure.

Pros
-Includes great amount of minifigs for a 20 dollar AUD set
-Robber's gold tooth is metallic
-Includes search light on top of vehicle

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-26T04:12:19.937Z","Another Great Addition to the Police Range…","Finally, it came back into stock at Argos so I reserved one online and collected it from the local store the day after!  I had been looking for this set for quite a while and I am pleased to finally have it as part of the collection.

The set is supplied with two minifigs; a police officer and a criminal with a mischievous grin!   The only accessory provided is a small loudhailer.  The build was nice and simple; the chassis is a one piece plate on which the rest of the van is built.   The colour scheme is uniform white with grey wheel arches and trim.  The small cab seats just one minifig (the police officer, unless something has gone horribly wrong and the criminal gets in there!).  This area is very simple and features just one yellow seat, steering wheel but no doors!   There is an observation window from the cab into the cell; there are also colour coordinated lockers on either side of the vehicle.   The cell is quite large (for the one supplied minifig) and contains nothing!   I guess if they’ve done wrong they are denied any comfort at all.   Grey doors and barred windows complete the cell nicely.   The roof of the cell is fully removable so that access can be gained and this area is decorated with blue lights, air-horns, GPS dish and a searchlight.   The set also features graphics which need to be applied, I don’t mind these as my sets are placed on display, but the graphics do cover more than one brick, therefore limiting deconstruction and rebuilding. 

In summary, the set looks great, a few issues could have been addressed but it looks excellent when displayed with the other sets from this line.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Scott1","2016-03-26T21:55:04.72Z","The Beginning of a New Era","<p>Prior to 2005, almost every Lego set was juniorized in some way. In 2005, that started to change. Lego rolled out sets that not only were easy to build for younger fans, but looked well enough to have AFOLs satisfied. This set was one of them.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Since I purchased this set from Russia without the box, I was/am unable to see what the box looks like. The instructions were error-free, as with almost all Lego instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This was one of the first times that, instead of using various pieces with studs on one side, Lego made a realistic grille. This drastically improves looks of the model. The set also marks the first inclusion of the fender pieces. Prior to this, wheels and, as a result, the whole car looked juniorized and unrealistic.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with two minifigures; a crook and a policeman. This was one of the first times the policeman has a police cap on; prior to this, policemen wore baseball caps. Basic, yet a huge leap in terms of realisticness. It also includes accessories for them like&nbsp;handcuffs, but the flashlight on the&nbsp;roof can be taken off and put into&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;minifigure&#39;s (hopefully&nbsp;the policeman&#39;s)&nbsp;hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was pretty short for me. It was designed to be easy, like the World City sets, however it looks good as well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When compared to today&#39;s sets, this doesn&#39;t look as good as it did in 2005. When you compare it to the&nbsp;World&nbsp;City police sets, this set is a huge improvement.&nbsp;There are stickers, which can be annoying at times. Since I bought it used,&nbsp;the stickers were already applied. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. When it was originally released, the set cost $12.99, which was a great value. While it might&nbsp;be primitive by today&#39;s&nbsp;standards, it marked the end to the juniorized era of Lego sets, and marked the beginning of&nbsp;a new era, one&nbsp;where sets can be easy to build,&nbsp;sturdy enough to play with&nbsp;and&nbsp;look&nbsp;great all at once.</p>
