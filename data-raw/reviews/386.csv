The printed &quot;V&quot; tile is a nice touch. Too bad there is nothing printed on the 1 x 4 white tile that is on the back of the racer. A black &quot;v&quot; pattern would have been cool. There is nothing rare about this set (besides the printed tile) so if you wanted to create a racing scene using variations of this model, it would be easy to accomplish. Another set from the 80's that survived my Dark Ages.

They were a cheap stocking stuffer that my parents obviously saw some value in.  I can still easily find the parts and put it together in no time at all!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
