This is only my 2nd review on Brickset and I'm from the U.S., so give me some slack...  ;)
This time I'm going to be reviewing set 7246 Mini Digger
--------------------------------
Hmmmm....not much to talk about.
Well, as usual, I'm going to do a Pro and Cons review.
--------------------------------
INFO:
Name/Set #: Mini Digger; Set#7246
Theme: City (NOT World City; this is official)
Pieces: 36

PROs:
-A little digger for a LITTLE price
-Has a nice minifigure with tools (shovel and jackhammer)
-Could be a good supplemental set (I bought 3 just for the minifig and the tools!)

CONs:
-The shovel is a tad too big and is very akward (for it to touch the ground flat, the main body will be lifted and tilted (-1)
-Very,very open design (makes it way too juniorized and peculiar) (-1)
-The model is not to scale... the height of the digger is twice the height of the minifig (-1)
-So-so design with little playability alone (-2)

....Giving it a 5 out of 10....

Hmmmm....what else?
Not much...
-------------------------------
AND:
So anyways...have fun and try visiting:
-www.Eurobricks.com (for news and a forum)
-www.LEGO.com (the official site)
-------------------------------
OVER and OUT!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-21T05:47:25Z","Not that good","I don't really like this model. The amount of pieces is normal for a small set like this.
But the design is very mishappened. The wheels look to big for that small model and it's extremely unrealistic and too open. I don't like the front shovel very much. It's unrealistic compared to the old bobcat from 1992. Well the price is really good for the set, because it's only about 4â‚¬. The tools are in the back and these are classic minifig tools, which have first appeared in the 80s and 90s.
That brings me to an ok 6/10",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T21:37:24Z","Finally came in off back order from S&amp;H","I like this little set especially the scooper on the front. It is a small set, very affordable, and like all of the new City mini figures dude looks good. Suppose to be a S&amp;H exclusive and I like to try and get those if they're not too much. For the investment you can't miss get the set!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Beren","2007-04-13T17:01:39.38Z","Good set. Nice price!","This set reminds me of sets from the early 80's. It compliments 6678, which I also own. Simple, out-of-scale design, only a handful of pieces and no specialised ones. I like the minifig a lot. He is like the facelift version of the ones from sets like 542. I also really like the price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shima55","2007-10-06T23:08:51.107Z","Very nice, classic-style set","This is a very good model that is highly standard of a City set, which is a good thing. The simplicity and amount of small sets in the City theme are very similar to older 80's-90's era Town sets.

Pros:
Minifigure is good
Comes with two tools
Nice giant shovel piece
Sturdy construction
Excellent price
Tool storage
Take off giant shovel to make All-Terrain vehicle

Cons:
None I can think of

Overall, a highly recommended City set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Barack_Obama","2007-11-06T17:08:15.297Z","What is it?","Wow this is seriously bad. It must have fallen from the ugly Lego tree and hit every branch down. Its not even cute, which could give it an extra point!

Its proportions are insane. If anyone can show me anything that looks like this in real life, I will come over even if you live in Argentina and personally shake your hand.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T19:26:33.437Z","Arm can be longer","This set goes well with the heavy hauler, that is if you can extend the arm way more! The arm is waay to short, but I fixed that problem easily. It should have a roof. The set comes with worker, shovel, jackhammer and working bucket. The price was decent, but the design can be better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"DevDevBeck","2009-06-09T23:38:31.153Z","Cool little Lego set!","The 7246-Mini Digger is a cool little set. It is all a worker needs in a little package. It works like a charm, and it matches the street sweeper perfectly!

The Mini Digger has a big plow on the front, 4 tread tires, an engine cover, a rack a shovel, and a jackhammer. That's basically all of it. This set is very useful, and it goes very well with some other construction sets, such as the Street Sweeper.

The Mini Figure is nothing special. Just a man with a Orange Safety Jacket, A blue T-Shirt and some blue Jeans. 

All in all, buy this set because It is useful for almost any situation in lego city, as well as it matches almost all other construction sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-07-30T10:57:10.827Z","Good for Parts.","I didn't expect much from the small set here, I bought it merely for parts. Once I took it home, I extended it to a much larger Digger. The one on the box cover looks like a midget carrying a large yellow bathtub.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BrickPiet44","2008-12-28T15:47:32.437Z","Nice little set, good addition","This is a nice little starters set. It is also quite simple, easy to construct but also fair but limited playability. Best used as an addition to a greater collection of sets.

Pro's: 
- nice minifigure
- easy to construct
- good sized shovel, big enough to get some stones and move them.
- good addition if you have already some other sets

Con's:
- shovel does not move to high, so can not be used for moving stones into a high tipper truck
- a bit too simple design
- only to be used with other sets",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-03-23T12:44:53.497Z","One Of My First Little Sets!","I got this way back in 2005. It was one of my first lego Sets ever. I have to say as well, that is was worth the price! With a moveable shovel thing on the front, a spade and a pneumatic drill, and a cool builder minifig... it makes this set worth while! I suppose compared to the new sets it's not as good, but in terms of the year it came out in it's really cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2011-11-19T00:29:29.587Z","It's like an ATV with a shovel","I got this as part of a larger collection of Construction sets. It's just a goofy little set. It looks like a little off road vehicle that somebody slapped a shovel on the front of. At least it comes with a jackhammer instead of a radio or a coffee mug like every other City set. As long as you have other larger construction sets for this to accentuate, it's decent. But by itself it's too small and wonky to do much with.&nbsp;",FALSE,2,2,3,2,3
"HaulingBricks","2023-04-04T15:55:14.587Z","Mini Digger 7246 Review","<p>Not much to say about Mini Digger 7246 that the title doesn&#39;t already say.</p>

<p>The build experience is brief but not bad.&nbsp; It is an extremely simple, quick build.</p>

<p>The part usage is average.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to get a bucket and a Minifigure, but other than that it is a 36-piece set, with 8 of those parts being for the wheels.</p>

<p>Playability is also about average.&nbsp; It can lift the bucket and tip it, but that&#39;s about it.&nbsp; Mini Digger feels like it was definitely intended to be more of a support type vehicle for a larger set.</p>

<p>I acquired this set in 2023 and it was surprisingly expensive to get ahold of, given what it is.</p>
