"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-12T14:38:14Z","Construction Zone...","The model seems rather large when compared with other City vehicles except the mobile crane and dump truck.

I like the inclusion of the locking pin to keep the cab from turning around while the vehicle is being driven to the site - but the vehicle is too wide for lego roads.

The stickers for the sides of the engine unit overlap bricks, so the model cannot be dismantled after being built without damaging the stickers.  I would recommend cutting these stickers to size before putting them on.

The storage bay under the hatch on the top for storing the hazard sign-board seems strange - I would have thought the engine or hydraulics should be in this bay.

The hazard sign-board is a printed part, which is very welcome.  Pity there is only one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The box contains two separate parts bags and manuals, one for the base, one for the cab, which seems odd since neither one of them is particularly large or complex. Construction is straightforward with a pleasingly solid build, thanks to a number of large parts - including a yellow sloped brick I hadn't seen since #6388. There is an error in the manual; my box had an extra card with the correct assembly instructions. The error, fortunately, is minor, a simple case of the wrong brick being displayed. 

While the included road sign is printed, the other markings have to be added via stickers. The side stripes cover two bricks which makes the model difficult to disassemble without damaging them; quite unfortunate. The stickers do look good on the completed model.

The design itself is realistic in typical Lego fashion. The cab can either swivel freely or be conveniently locked in place with a pin. Features of the model includes an articulated arm and storage space in the rear, though this may have been better suited to an engine - a conversion I plan to do soon. The roof and windshield open, however, the hinge breaks off very easily. The use of a standard steering wheel instead of two levers is peculiar. 

Overall, the set looks good, has a few clever touches and hardly any noteworthy problems. If you like construction machinery, by all means add this set to your collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Big, really working digger
Digger body is very solid
Working wheel treads
Looks massive

Cons:
Stickers

Cheers,

He loved it, but it kept breaking: he tried to drive it around and use it to pick up bricks, and it was just no good.  Thinking about it, even though the set *looks* realistic, its design is actually unlike any real digger: the turning point should be in the *center* of the base, but it is actually all the way to one end.  I'm sure this is done to make the top stable by putting its turning point as close as possible to the digger arm.  In a real digger the engine would be much heavier so this wouldn't be necessary.  Anyway, somehow the set keeps breaking for us at the turntable.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-24T20:30:51.857Z","Tenth B-Day Present","Alright, good set, and it looks like LEGO put some thought into it, because they even included a little roadblock!  Anyway, the whole thing spins at a pivot near the front, and you can stop it from pivoting by inserting the included pin into two holes.  This digger also includes a shovel and a jackhammer.  But, I wish the digger would pivot in the middle; it looks ridiculous if you turn it all the way around to get at something you wanna dig up.

Pros:

-Tools

-Roadblock

-Minifig

-Pivots

-Clean up LEGO City

Cons:

-Pivots at front

-Digger arm is kinda stiff

-Looks ridiculous when turned around

Overall:  4/5.  Get it if you see it and have nothing else you're interested in, but I would get Gresh or some other new Bionicle if I were you. :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>I enjoyed the building experience quite a bit.&nbsp; It is fun to build the frame and add the tracks to it and equally fun to assemble the cab and arm.&nbsp; The build is interesting and goes together well.</p>

<p>The part usage on this model from 2005 is also fairly decent.&nbsp; The rubber tracks are nice to have as well as the bucket for the arm.&nbsp; Definitely some good MOC parts in this set if you&#39;re interested in building construction equipment.</p>

<p>The downfall of this set is playability.&nbsp; For some reason, the cab doesn&#39;t pivot in the center of the tracks and actually pivots from the rear.&nbsp; This causes the model to be unstable at times and easily tip over as well as cause the build to take up quite a bit of space when rotating.&nbsp; I was not a fan of the functionality of the Digger.</p>

<p>Overall, this is nice set worth collecting but not one I&#39;d track down for the kids.</p>
