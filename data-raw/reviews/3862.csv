A very nice set with many details!
As a collector I regret that that it's not easy to open the box without damage; but besides that lots of fun.
I placed it beside my trainworkshop and right now it's lifting an old loc for repair ;-)

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T21:36:36Z","Disappointed","Everything was great until the actual crane.  First, I was missing a piece (1x6 light gray).  Second, the crane is almost impossible to extend.  Takes lots of force.  Third, my string started twirling up whenever it had slack.  Very annoying.

Oh, and it only has 2 figs for $50.  Still, everything else is fantastic!  Buy it if you have the cash to spare - otherwise, go for something like the Construction Site.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T18:38:34Z","Great","just got mine yesterday ,love it :D !!! Its one of the best sets this year (at least so far,I`m lookin&#180;forward for the Star Wars stuff) 
50 euro is awesome for this thing.Last year this set would
cost about 70-80 euro.I think Lego is on the right way,
but i liked the prototype better (you can see it on Brickshelf).Go get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-21T06:54:52Z","Simply awesome","This set was part of my LEGOLAND Germany purchases yesterday. Bought it along with 7242, 7244 and 7246.
Now to the review:
This set is great, altough there are some big pieces like the large vehicle bases or the parts for the crane boom. There are many functions like a steering, which is a bit slow in reaction. The steering even works as the connector for the two parts of the lower crane body. The crane body itself can be rotated to 360&#176;. There are also stilts, for making working at the construction site safe. The crane boom is a little bit hard to extend, but playing with it very often makes it easier. The cab is unstable if not connected to the crane and there are even doors and the two minifigs have much space since the crane truck is about 12-wide. Did I mention this thing is huge? It's over 40cm long. And the price is great. It's only 50€ for over 500 pieces. There is a load for the crane hook and some kind of safety tools. Too bad those small tool things don't fit on the crane without making it a little bit unrealistic.
Only thing I don't like are the 4 separate instruction books, but they don't lower the rating.
This set is definately a great 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2005-05-24T06:08:10Z","Could have been better","This is a quite impressive set at first glance, but has one or two things I don’t like – mainly to do with the playability. As has been said before some of the construction is a bit juniorised, but it says on the box that this is to enhance playablity – presumably with several people making various bits to come together as the whole. If one person makes it, the construction is not really complex enough in my view to justify this but perhaps I am a little older than they envisaged!

The main things I do not like are the stabilisers. When these are retracted in the up position the rear pair restrict the movement of the vehicle which making it difficult to turn, due to the rigidity of the boom with an articulated chassis underneath – it just doesn’t work unless you remove the stabilisers or leave them sticking out to give a clearance. The real thing would have probably had a rigid base and definitely steerable wheels - which would have been a better solution. Again perhaps I am being too discerning compared to more junior builders. When you separate the front tractor unit from the crane base it is nose heavy and unconvincing. Once you set the crane up on its stabilisers it gets better – the crane works well, but it would have been better with working rams. The last thing I do not like is the cab for the crane. This has to be folded out of the way to the rear to allow the stabilisers to lift up, but is not secured and flops about backwards and forwards. Finally there are stickers, which if it is for juniors I should have thought could have been done as printed. I was a little disappointed with this set in terms of its design and construction, but I accept is probably is aimed at younger less discerning builders/owners. I think a fair rating is a 4.

"Zamees","2007-03-19T17:45:08.857Z","Nice Addition to Construction","All in all, a decent looking crane.  Working features still need work.  The boom is hard to extend and the outriggers come out of the slot if you're not careful.  Outrigger feet come off very easily as well.  Not sure about the crane hook.  Maybe would have been better with part #70496 (Technic Crane Hook).  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-24T00:05:41.593Z","Huge set!","This is a huge set. Make no mistake about that. I was glad it was broken down into build parts. This is a set that makes builders happy happy, it is intricate enough to be a good challenge. Not sure I like how wide this is as it doesn't fit down any of the Lego streets, it takes up both lanes and a bit. I was amazed at how strong this set is. I hoisted and held up 9 of the black ballast bricks, filled with a lead bar the size of a 2x2x8, before straining the main arm of the lift. The cockpit is fantastic as both driver and operator can sit inside comfortably with plenty of room. This really does make a wonderful compliment to the tower crane at a construction site but as stated it really does crowd a street in Legotown. Still, if you like the construction sub-theme in the City theme then you need to get this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T01:24:02.53Z","Good But Too Big","Lego is a funny company because before they had gone in one direction by juniorizing many of their town sets (i.e. dumbing them down).  Now, Lego is moving in the other direction by going for ultra-realistic or massive sets.  This crane set is one of the impetuses for that direction in the town area.  It's one of the first sets that I can recall where you can put two guys in the front seat.  But that type of design makes this style suffer since now it'll be hard to fit this type of set on a normal road.

The set mostly is sturdy, the exception being the loose swiveling crane controlling cockpit.  Mine is very loose and sticks out.  But I do like the attention to detail on it.  The various stickers and the rear section that can be deployed, allowing the crane section to realistically be set upright.  I just wish I had more space for this type of thing.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-14T15:58:30.903Z","Too big and clumsy","I bought this set a year ago just because it was on sale. The set contains an enormous mobile crane - it's really enormous and can't fit to any of Lego city scenes. It's 12 studs wide, so, it's wider than any airplane or it's as wide as a big container ship! I don't see any reason for that.

This huge set contains only 2 minifigs, pretty original ones though but only two. And the price is equal to let's say the 7945 where you get 2 vehicles, building structures, 4 minifigs etc. Surely, these sets can be hardly compared but I did it to show that the 7249 isn't worth buying.

The new mobile crane from 7633 set is much more to scale and much better designed.

I give this set only 3 - for figures and lots of useful pieces which are its advantages. Still, the disadvantages stand out clearer.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Sepehr_sani","2016-06-27T13:11:28.303Z","I love this set!","<p>i love this set! Specially the cool design of the crane,I don&#39;t care if it fits or not but I have found something cool in it.nearly everyone who has this set loves to see/build the tower crane or the other truck model on the set&#39;s last instruction book,and I&#39;ve built it nearly exact! Want to share it with you.the only problem is that it can handle less weight than the normal crane.by the way it can be motorized!i have done that too ;) (It is very old,too many dirt on it beside a little bit of part loss)</p>

"Lego4432lover","2017-02-25T03:08:39.787Z","The best Lego city Mobil crane overall","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>O<i>V</i>ERALL</strong>&nbsp;I like this set the build was great overall but bag 4 is the trickest with string I got this in 2016 so I have the 2009 Mobil crane and don&#39;t own but the town square crane I have seen from 2013 &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seprate Cab Section:</p>

<p>The cab build I enjoyed very much it was straight forward and surprising what to come if you can&#39;t tell I got this brand new sealed so the build I was surprised with technic pins connecting the main cab to the Mobil road car thing very good also I like how Lego uses a technic pole to connect the crane and cab smart and good for turns the inside is very detailed with 1&nbsp;stirring wheels a control panel and 2 chairs&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crane Details:</p>

<p>if you look on the back of the crane there&#39;s a very detailed back lights and a sticker saying SPECIAL TRANSPORT the control cab is smart swinging back when in transport the crane turning is surrounded by long tiles just adding to detail&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>playibility is is great the most simple stabilizers for a Mobil crane coming out and in you can rig and unrig the crane can extend a boomarm and has a whinch it can spin around and can be transported easily</p>

<p>Minifigs and Cargo:</p>

<p>the minifigs fit perfect for the job also the faces are amazing to collect and the gray wackie talkie the cargo I am disappointed can&#39;t they add 2 or 3 more of the same cargo seriously</p>

<p>Traffic Barriers:</p>

<p>the parts to collect are very good they are molded very black and can hold a shovel 3 out of the 4 barriers can easily fit onto the crane when transported&nbsp;</p>

"Tie_defender","2019-08-15T10:08:32.33Z","Very cool crane","<p>This is a great set for your construction site, with lots of functions and basic details.</p>

<h2>Pros and cons:</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>Great value, considering you get such a big vehicle</p>

<p>Winch works well</p>

<p>Folds up nicely</p>

<p>Engine detail</p>

<p>Easy to turn thanks to a technic rod in the middle</p>

<p>Lots of wheels</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>It barely fits on the lego city road, because it is 12 studs wide.</p>

<p>Lots of stickers</p>

<p>Very common minifigures</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a great playpiece and looks good on a construction site, but it is almost to wide for the road.&nbsp;</p>

"HaulingBricks","2023-04-05T12:32:49.647Z","XXL Mobile Crane 7248 Review","<p>Ah, the XXL Mobile Crane.&nbsp; One of my favorite designs by Henrik Andersen.&nbsp; This is an excellent set overall but does have some shortcomings.</p>

<p>The build experience is long but rewarding.&nbsp; This behemoth somehow only has 524 pieces but will feel like 1,000 when you&#39;re done building.&nbsp; There are a lot of nice techniques used in the build and the different parts of the crane are exciting to see come together.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoyed the constructions of this set.</p>

<p>Part usage was on point for the XXL Mobile Crane as well.&nbsp; Many parts are used in creative ways and really push what 524 parts can do.&nbsp; This is a gold mine for MOC parts as there are tons of various elements for many different things in the set.</p>

<p>The downfall comes at play time.&nbsp; Perhaps it is just me, but the crane is a little frustrating to play with.&nbsp; The extendable anchors always lose their dish feet, parts constantly pop off, and the crane can be a bit touchy at times.&nbsp; Definitely feels like an adult model when it is finished.</p>

<p>Overall, the XXL Mobile Crane is a blast to assemble but is quite expensive nowadays and definitely needs to be kept on display.</p>
