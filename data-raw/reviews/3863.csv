"brickzone","2007-03-20T14:25:45.653Z","Excellent starter set","This set is full of good starter bricks for town/houses/buildings as with many basic sets of similar age. However, this one is noteworthy for having quite a number of non-trivial bricks; the lampposts &amp; lamps, castle corner pieces, the trellis and skylight windows, a set of smooth tiles, diagonal bricks/flats, glass archways, palm tree, furnishings and people accessories.

I highly recommend this set for town or general building resources, it has a little bit of all kinds of bricks, not just the simple ones.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

One look at the pic above is enough to show you that this one is worth every penny. It doesn't only contain a nice selection of white bricks, red roof tiles & a few house-themed parts (including chairs, windows, doors, umbrellas), but also comes with two street lanterns, which are still quite rare.

Add to that 2 minifigs, animals and some trees & flowers and you'll know why I believe this is a perfect addition to any LEGO collection and can be used to build anything you'd want.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>The set contains various parts (mainly in white and red): roof tiles, regular bricks, a few window and door pieces, as well as some lamp posts and trans-clear curved panels. None of these are particularly rare, but having them all together makes this a very useful &quot;base&quot; pack to build a classic town house.</p>

<p>Besides being a nice parts pack, there are also instructions for a total of 5 different models. Though there are 5 different models, there are only enough bricks to make 1 model at a time. In this sense, the set is very similar to the modern 3-in-1 sets from the Creator line.</p>

<p>One big difference compared to the 3-in-1 sets is that the models do not make optimal use of the available parts. For example, when building the house with the slanted roof I noticed that more than half the parts were not used. It would have been nice if there was a model that used something like 90% of the parts, but this is not the case.</p>

<p>The models themselves are fairly well designed. The two large houses are the standout builds and are probably the things that most people will want to build first.</p>

<p>There is one thing that bugged me, which is the fact that the house with the slanted roof has a quirk which makes it so that you can&#39;t properly &quot;close&quot; the model. I did not notice this at first, but you can see on the box that the two gray plates are not &quot;closed&quot;. I.e. they are at an angle and don&#39;t touch each other. This is because there&#39;s two window pieces at the sides of the house which stick out slightly. It an be easily fixed by removing these two pieces, but I found it odd that they would suggest a build like this.</p>

<p>In summary I think this often overlooked set is definitely worth having a look at. Any of the builds should look good together with Town sets from the late 80&#39;s to early 90&#39;s.</p>
