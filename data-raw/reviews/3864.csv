It's a great build, with cool pieces (no stickers!) and a captain-ranked Clone Trooper.  Over piece/price (108 pieces), with four extra pieces every time.

It even comes with a Captian Clone Trooper (according to the annimated &quot;Clone Wars&quot; sieries)! One of its amazing features, is that the head can be looking all the way to the left, when the cannons could be facing all the way to the right! The legs' minuveribilty however, is a totaly different story. Bottom line: they arn't that posible. They can't REALLY move all that well (exept backwords). Well, this set is great.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T12:24:56Z","One of the best for the price bracket","This set looks good and has many pieces, and includes a great minifig. In addition to the main build, the little speeder thingy on the back of the box and manual was a challenge (for me anyway) and has suprisingly high swooshability. Bought 3 of these for AU$7.50 at Target.

Good minifig
Good model

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T15:53:25Z","An Excellent Second Episode III Set for All","First off, Ice must not own the set. The trooper included does have red markings, and therefore is of the captain rank. Of course, you would not know that if you just went by the picture posted here on Brickset above.

Anyway, I purchased this set this morning with the ARC-170 (review for that to come soon) and built it most happily. With this set, I received a lot of new pieces, including the feet, the front blast shield, and of course, the Clone Trooper in the new design. The set is a quick build, and one can appreciate the ingenuity of Lego designers while building this little intricate machine (really named AT-RT).

When played with, it is fun to pose, and it looks great, albeit shiny, next to my AT-AT and AT-TE. Let me tell you, you will never want that AT-ST set after getting this, for it will certainly be obvious that the AT-ST set is now terribly primitive and looks horrendous.

Anyway, for a set this good, it is hard to find something wrong. However, I was a bit displeased with the pricing, now that I look at the set. It just doesn't seem like $10 worth of Lego bricks. Maybe because all the pieces are so small?

Anyway, I highly recommed this set to any newcomers to the Star Wars line. One of 2005 best.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The poor driver is open to arms fire, but heck, hez a Clone Captain, so he knows wudda do!  The legs are nice and arent the simple gear things you would imagine.

I suppose they want to give it a high rating so they can feel better about buying the set. Anyway, it's still an amazing set. It comes with a pretty cool Clone Trooper, although I still think the Green Ones are better than this one.

The legs also don't move forward, you'd have to move one of them back to assume it walking. Furthermore, They should've attached two Blasters (Megaphone) to each side so it looked nicer. Luckily I got the ARC-170 a day before this, so I had enough to put side to side.

The front part with the laser cannons is nice. It's versatile for movement and only does when you turn it. It's neat how you can de-attach the part that the Clone sits on and use it as a hover bike like in 7101. Hell, it's even better than the one in there.

When built, the model itself is fairly impressive and stands nice and tall.  Altogether, I would say you get good value for the price (I paid $14.99 CAN), though the set is far from perfect.

The biggest problem for me is the joint where the leg assembly meets the operator's platform.  There is only one ill-fitting element that holds the legs and the rest of the walker together, and it's very prone to coming loose.  Why Lego didn't go the distance and make better joint to connect the lower and upper halves is beyond me.

"greymav","2008-03-08T14:54:18.763Z","Mixed, overall, but nifty.","First, the good: it looks really nice, posed on a shelf. The overall design is complex enough to look cool without seeming overly busy, and the &quot;head&quot; is small enough to seem light while substantial enough to keep it from looking silly. A major plus is that the feet are wide enough, relative to the overall size of the set, that it's the most stable LEGO walking set I've acquired; much less likely to fall over than, say, the ExoForce sets can sometimes be. I haven't seen this design on other Clone Trooper armor, either, so it's a nice thing to have for that.

However, there are a few serious problems with the set. The legs are nice to look at, but can separate easily from the rest of the set; also, it's almost impossible to actually put the walker in a realistic walking pose, due to the limits of the leg joints. The pilot is almost completely exposed except from the front, which may strain suspension of disbelief, and the under-hanging gun on the front seems a little unstable.

"willow2323","2009-07-12T06:16:30.06Z","MARCH INTO BATTLE... AND GET GUNNED DOWN","I really enjoyed building and using this set. It's got some nifty little features, although the legs don't move forwards and back very well. If you buy more than one, it can really help build up a clone army. This is all very well, but when you douse it in battle you can't help but think its an easy target. It's only about 3/5 the size of an Lego AT-ST. So you'd expert size to be replaced with weaponry and armour, but it isn't. I can tell why it's just a scout walker instead of an upfront battle veichle. If you want a nice army builder, buy this, but if you want a heavy artillery set with big blasters the save up abit more for the AT-AP. (I know it isn't Lego's fault for the lack of armour and weapons, but still...).
Thanks for reading, I'm only 7

"AETerry","2012-02-23T13:28:16.953Z","Clone Scout Walker Review","<p>While I love Star Wars, I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy of movies and when LEGO sets come out, I'm far far more likely to consider a set from the original movies. So it says something of interest when I pick up a set that's from the newer trilogy or Clone War series. The set originally retailed for about $10 when it first came out, which given the piece count is a very decent pricing for this set.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is fairly standard and shows a clear depiction of what you're getting. The instructions are easy to follow step-by-step illustrated instructions. What I dislike most is that it's not clear at times what color or shade of brick is needed unless you have the color picture and know you're looking for dark grey and not black. It's not a problem the first time you build the set, but it's a problem if you go to rebuild the set later and all the pieces are mixed in with several others.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's 108 pieces over all, a lot of greys and jointed pieces for making this Walker.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get one red clone warrior minifigure. It's not a bad one, I'm far more partial to the Storm Troopers from the classic trilogy. The figure is well detailed and looks very good with the whole of the set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model<br></h4><p>As a small set, the build is very quick and easy to zip through. That it's small walker bot, almost a precursor to the AT-STs is what got my attention for getting this set. I like this style of robotic vehicle.<br></p>My biggest complaint with the set is that the legs don't seem very stable to me and every now and then if I set it down wrong, the Walker tends to want to fall over.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>It's a very good little set for those who are into the Star Wars LEGOs and collect them. It's a rather simple set and build and very well detailed. It might be fun to see if LEGO re-releases this set again or a very similiar one like it as I love these little walker bots.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-09T14:05:53.96Z","Execute Order 66","<p>Set #7250 Clone Scout Walker: Also known more commonly as the AT-RT (All Terrain Recon Transport.) This set is a fun little addition to any Star Wars display and was at the initial time of release a cheap way to troop build Episode III Clones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the AT-RT is fun and easy, the instructions make it very intuitive and not too difficult. Unfortunately I'm not sure how well the plastic quality stands up with this set, of course it could just be my choice in displaying or storage areas, but some of the bricks on mine show obvious cracking starting in the side these days. (And I wasn't exactly rough with this set when I first got it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Clone Trooper is of the style with the black head piece to mimic the visor for the helmet thus there are no faces printed on this guy. It is in the style of the Clone Recon Troopers I believe they're called and if I'm remembering&nbsp;right the torso&nbsp;is double sided. Accessory wise you have one of the older Space themed blasters with the little blue jewel piece for the tip, but as a bonus it can store on the Walker while he's riding it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this LEGO Star Wars set is ok, definitely one that I recommend, it isn't like the Clone Troopers Battle Pack, but it isn't meant to be. And as a bonus more than one of them make for any good Kashhyyk display. I would however make careful observations when buying it second hand to make sure the pieces aren't cracking or cracked... I'm still not sure why mine suffers from this. The pieces don't feel any cheaper than other LEGO sets so I have to assume it is due to the extreme cold temperatures that sometimes occur where I keep it in storage.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

"Chills","2012-10-18T12:06:46.247Z","The AT-ST's predecessor","<p>Of the prequel trilogy movies I like ROTS the best. It also has the coolest ships and vehicles. This Clone Scout walker is one of the neat vehicles that ties the movie in with the original trilogy. As soon as it appeared on the screen I thought, Hey, that's the predecessor for the AT-ST. Its smaller, lighter armed and armored. You can see how the Empire ended up enclosing the cockpit to protect the pilot, made the walker bigger and added weapons. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: This really is a great little set. It looks exactly like the walker from the movies, down to the spindly legs, the small cockpit, big foot pads, and the long cannon in the front. You can really picture this walker tromping through Felucia.<br></li><li>Pro 2: I don't have many Clone Troopers, so I'm glad to have this red one in my collection. I read another review that named the clone's unit, so I'll have to take that reviewer's word for it. <br></li><li>Pro 3: The playability is decent for the set. The legs move, as does the cannon. There are some nice splashes of green and red so the whole set isn't simply grey. And I like how the front armor is printed with the details and I didn't have to apply stickers. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Looking at this set with a critical eye I really can't think of anything I'd change. It is small, simple, and inexpensive... which is what its designed to be. If I had to be picky I'd ask for some more detail in the cockpit, it is a bit plain.<br></li></ul>
<p>For those of you who are big fans of the new trilogy this set is a must-have. Even if you're collection focuses more on the original trilogy this still is a great set to have. It looks cool next to my 2 AT-STs. It is inexpensive and has a cool minifigure, plus LEGO did a great job modeling it after the walker in the movies. <br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"ChocolateCrisps","2012-09-08T06:48:00.493Z","A great set for it's size!","<p>When this came out in 2005 I had a bit of spare money and was looking for a smallish set. I saw this on a shelf in Hamleys and I bought it immediately. I have never regretted that decision.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box looks pretty exciting and shows off the set quite well. The back has the various features of the set (moveable legs and gun), the alternate models (a space fighter and a speeder thing) and the other sets of the wave. The instructions are pretty simple but are fun and have various pictures at the back, which I always enjoyed looking at as a five year old.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts are the sort of basic parts that most lego star wars scout walkers use, but the printed blast shield is a nice piece to have.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4>The minifigure is quite detailed and unique in that it is printed with the uniform of the 91st Reconnaissance Corps, which does not appear in any other sets.
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is simple but fun and is fairly average for a set of it's size.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I don't know why but this is one of my favourite lego sets. It is small and compact but fun and well articulated, which might be why it appeals to me. It also looks very good, and stands out next to my (many) other star wars sets. The only other thing that it needs is a battle droid to fight.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I really recommend this set.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
