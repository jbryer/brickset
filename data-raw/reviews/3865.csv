The head underneath the Vader mask has a new face and all the minifigs look very nice, even the new skin tone's not too bad. On the one hand it looks nicer but on the other LEGO PPL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YELLOW!

Otherwise, stay away - the parts aren't that great otherwise.  No lightsaber or cape for Vader - -.5 points.  The robot doesn't have one of those pivoting pieces underneath, so it doesn't turn that easily (the upper part can turn, but it's not easy).  So -.5 points for that as well.

"Gus_263","2008-07-04T19:54:36.39Z","Now he is Darth Vader completely","This set was released in the year of 2005, is a small set from the Star Wars theme, and Episode 3 subtheme (Revenge of the Sith, common during that year). At the first view, thius set looks like to be unrealistic, and really small. Small it is, but it have a decent accuracy with the movie.

The set's base is made by some gray plates, and is increased by some brown pieces, with different shapes, that are putted in each side of the base. At the center, more pieces increase the base and this makes the part to put the scorched Anakin and to put the &quot;new&quot; Darth Vader. A cilindrical shaped brick makes it spin, and in a side you can fit Anakin in the operation table, and in the other you put the Darth Vader. It is really simple to make, but it is cool, altough isn't that accurate with the movie (of course, in the movie Anakin don't had half legs and an arm, you cannot make it to a minifigure).

The robot of the operation is also simple, using a semi pyramidal shaped brick as base, and a piece with some parts to put the arms, that are increased with lots of tools of operation. The red small circular plate used as the &quot;eyes&quot; or visor of the robot is cool due to the accuracy it features. At all, this robot is a good addition with a nice accuracy, altough still much Lego made like, and also it is cool with lots (if 5 tools are a lot, it is a lot) of useful tools.

Overall, this set is basic but still nice, due to the color schemes used in the base of operations, due to the two minifigures (Anakin and Darth Vader are great additions to Lego Star Wars, of course, and are really cool), robot (this show a great accuracy with the original), and altough it is a small, it is good for one. But it could be a bit more increased, with the Darth Vader's black cover, another type of robot and maybe the Darth Sidious' minifigure. Overall, it is a 4,8 of 5.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Jim_Java","2008-08-12T09:49:30.437Z","It Could Have Been Better","     I'm pretty sure if any scenes from the new Star Wars trilogy are as remembered as the ones from the old trilogy, then the assembly of Darth Vader will be.  Darth Vader on a gleaming table, his mask lowered onto him, as the many droids buzz around him.... Meanwhile, Emperor Palpatine stands nearby, waiting.
     So how does this set live up to that scene? It removes half the stuff that would have made it so much fun. Emperor Palpatine? Gone. The many droids? Gone, except for one rotating one with Lego tools attached (Including a hand drill-presumably, Darth Vader must have needed some screws and 
bolts inserted.)    This set does not have a mechanism that would allow you to attach Darth Vader's helmet, as the Star Destroyer (The 99.99 one, not the USC). That would have been fun. 
     What you're left with is all very clear on the box. You get battle damaged Anakin (oddly enough, he doesn't look very burned), and Darth Vader. By the way, Darth Vader doesn'tlook quite as menacing without his cloak. I get why they don't have a lightsaber, but he needed his cloak-after all, it was in the movie. 
     So, this set is obviously a cheap 9.99 stocking stuffer-but the scene it's recreating clearly deserves more.  If they wanted a stocking-stuffer price,they should have split it up into two parts. Darth Vader Transformation I would have (BURNED) Anakin on a gleaming table, with several droids. Part II would be similar to the real set, except A: No gimmicky rotating feature, and no Anakin figure, B: Emperor Palpatine included, C: A mechanism to attach Vader's helmet, and D: A way to make Darth Vader's table stay up, to better recreate the movie scene.
     In conclusion? There isn't much reason for serious Star Wars fans to get this, but if you're looking for a cheap stocking stuffer, or you just want to collect all the Episode III sets, get this one. But to those who want a movie accurate version, go online, order some Lego bricks, and start building.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>The turn table isn't bad for switching from Anakin to Darth Vader.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-09T14:15:21.043Z","Lord Vader, Rise","<p>Set #7251 Darth Vader Transformation: This set is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I still give it an overall rating of 5 for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, from the Revenge of the Sith sub-theme of Star Wars this is one of few sets that features a cheap way of getting Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker. Secondly, the medical droid built with this set is an impressive addition to your Mini-Figure collection and it comes equipped with a full set of tools. (Including a spare gas/oil can.) And of course this set is fun to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the tiny operating table with the turnstyle gimmick doesn't take very long to do and although you aren't given a cape or lightsabers it is in keeping with the scene depicted from the film. For the most part, true Vader did have his cape, but in this scene he had not yet recieved his Lightsaber and Anakin's was in the possession of Obi-Wan. LEGO Could have included those extra pieces, but why? Aside from giving you more to do with the Mini-Figures I suppose there really isn't a film accurate reason for them to have Lightsabers. (Or for Anakin to have hair.) So making the set without them isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will concede however that Vader should have included a cape, if only because he is iconic with his helmet and his cape, he is never seen without it throughout the Star Wars saga therefore the set should have included a cape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as I said I still rate this set a five. In spite of any potential flaws or wasted opportunities this set is still a fun little diversion and makes an interesting piece to display in any LEGO Star Wars set. Also the Medic Droid Mini-Figure is a must have buildable droid Mini-Figure in any collection. And the extra pieces left over if you prefer not to build the model are good for MOCing.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,4

Years later, he would sit at his computer and write this very review you read right now.</i></p><p>Now, acting epic aside, 7251 Darth Vader Transformation is a pretty cool set. For the price of $7, you get two minifigures- Darth Vader and a scarred Anakin Skywalker. Darth Vader resembles the type used in 2005 and 2006, but lacks a cape like he had in the film, and a lightsaber like he usually has (though he didn't have it in the film at this point).&nbsp;This is kind of a&nbsp;disappointing&nbsp;factor, as if Vader has a cape and a&nbsp;light-saber, this would be a fantastic way to get a valuable minifigure at a cheap price. Nonetheless, Vader still looks great, even without a cape.</p><p>The scarred Anakin is pretty movie accurate, as his hair was literally burned off. Like Vader, he lacks a lightsaber, though while he fought with Obi-wan, it was taken from him. Anakin is a pretty good figure, especially in terms of accuracy.</p><p>The actual play feature works fine. It works as a turntable, with one minifigure on one side, and the second figure on the other side, then spinning it around for Anakin to turn into Vader. The droid included can also move around on the platform, I THINK to reenact Vader forcing everything around.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The price is pretty low. For $6.99 you get a couple of cool minifigures and a neat set that recreates one of the most iconic and important scenes in all the Star Wars movies: the re-birth of Darth Vader into the semi-mechanical monster we all know!</li><li>Pro 2: The build was fun, not much to the set, but you do get a lot of cool tools. And the idea of the spin-able table to go from Anakin to Vader is clever.</li><li>Pro 3: The med droid is quite close to the movies, nice touch.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Like I said before, this is probably the most important scene in all of the Star Wars films, the re-birth of Darth Vader. Yet this set does not do the scene justice. I would have liked to see a whole med-center, maybe with the landing platform. It could have walls that dent in from Vader's grief-powered Force blow, and a mechanism that attaches his legs and one that lowers the face mask down.</li><li>Con 2: I also would like to have had the Emperor in this set.</li></ul>
<p>For an inexpensive set with cool minifigures this set works. But for such an important part of the movies I think Lego could have done a better job. Emperor's Shuttle 8096 has a good feature that slides Vader's helmet on and stands him up, also replicating this scene. This set is a different take with the spinning table.

<p>Starting with the box, I like it. The colour scheme works well. There is a fun alternate build of a cannon. The instructions are easy to follow, and has some fun ads in the back.</p>

<p>Starting with the build, the first thing I notice are the colours. There is a bit of tan and brown in the build. While I think this is very inaccurate, I think they did enough of it so it does not look bad. The table can spin to hold both minifigs. I did wish it could have lowered down much lower. The droid is fine. The tan droid arms hold tools. It is on a platform which can move.</p>

<p>The minifigs are the most interesting part, through the minifigs are not too interesting. They are not exclusive, as they came out in a promo version of this set. The Darth Vader is only exclusive because he lack a cape, but he is still a cool fig. He uses that fun old helmet that looks kinda cartoonish. The other version of Darth is not in the suit yet. The only exclusive part is the head, which resembles the face of him in the suit, which I like. I think Lego was a little lazy here, as a flesh toned arm would have made this figure much more interesting and accurate. While neither of them have accessories, there is a extra oil can.</p>

<p>Over all, this is a decent set for 2005. A cape and lightsaber would have been nice, but not necessary. I think this is a great set for collectors looking for an a old Darth. I think this a fun little set, and a worth addition to my collection.</p>
