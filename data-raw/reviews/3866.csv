the amount of stickers is irritating, but once you get them on and have the set made, it,s great.
it's also great to have the new jedi starfighter with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-10T18:31:18Z","Very good ","This is the first Episode 3 set I bought and it is a great set. The construction can be a bit complicated and the stickers a little annoying but once you get done building it's worth it. The construction design is very clever and advanced, has a lot of detail, and looks just like the Tri-fighter in the movies. I didn't really care for the buzz droid but that might change after I see the movie. Overall a highly reccomend set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-10T18:36:39Z","pretty good","I got this set also on the day that it came out (April 2nd) at Wal-mart and will now give you my pros/cons list:

Pros:
-Interesting Ep. III separatist color scheme, as previously seen in the vulture droid (i.e. dark and light blue elements with white and see-through red highlights)
-new elements found in the cockpit and wings, with *click* and not bending bubble cockpit elements)
-buzz droid (at least you can get it somewhere, as I hate it when lego disreguards figs seen in the movies, such as pilot clones, which are for some reason not found in the Republic Gunship and AT-TE, or vehicles, such as the Homing Spider Droid or the S-PHAT)
-beautiful, complex model design

Cons:
-on my model, the grey wheels didn't hold to the technic elements for some reason, and I had to replace them with grey wheels found in my collection. After replacing them, it held. Could it be that lego is begining to not be concerned by quality?!!
-cockpit bubbles are loose and wobble/don't hold together
-there are no missles like there really are on the Trifighter
-not sure what the red things in the front (not the guns are supposed to be
-many stickers which could have been printed
-the buzz droid has nowhere to sit and just kind of bounces around in the cockpit
-not sure if the buzz droid actually flies the ship, as I've heard they are lauched in missles and attach onto the hulls of enemy starships

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-18T12:27:25Z","Hmm?","I found this to be an interesting if overly repetetive build.  The finished model is a definitive 10, but I want to highlight two problems.

1. Stickers could have been printed

2. the cockpit is loose on its technic axle.

the only real con I have about this set is the same as everyone else.

The stickers

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-20T16:33:46Z","Amazingness","THis is a great set. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be alot of fun. I think that it was more fun to build than anything else. The only downside is stickrs. DON'T CUT ANY!!! I did by accident, but it still came out good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-20T17:16:08Z","Not without its flaws but good none the less!!","Here is a set that has not been ridicuiously over rated by some of the curious people who use this set. I agree the build is repetative but the final model is nice. The cockpit doesn't shut properly which is slightly annoying as is the fact that the wheel holding the cockpit in place needs a couple of extra pegs to hold it in place. Yet despite these flaws I an still compelled to award it a worthy 7.

To the people who have decided to criticise my review of the AT-RT model: I still stand by my review although it was perhaps more of a rant than a review. The AT-RT is the most disgustingly over rated set on this site and unless other reviewers see sense it looks like it will remain that way. I think it is a decent set but not worth a ten. A ten should be awarded to exceptional sets only. I see it has now risen to second in the overall rankings which is frankly a travesty. The fact that some people have seen fit to insult my review but also to insult my sexuality (what that has to do with lego mystifies me) is ridiculous. I have read this site for months but I have only started to review sets and I'll tell you I'm here to stay and if you don't like it then sorry but you will have to live with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2005-07-12T06:52:06Z","Belated post movie review update","For some reason I forgot to update my review of this after I saw the movie. I now think it is worth a maximum score - it is superb Lego have done a brilliant job of recreating this very interesting shaped craft. The buzz droid is also great. The one thing I have done to enhance mine is to add the 2 missiles that should be carried underneath I used cannon and rear engine parts from a spare Snowspeeder set. Possibly now my favourite Episode III set, certainly one of the best.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2007-09-30T10:21:18.797Z","Simple yet effective build","Based on the droid fighters from the Revenge of the Sith i have to say this is a very well made set. The Lego model&nbsp;actually really looks like the fighters from the film. Despite how complex the actual fighter looks Lego manage to pull off an&nbsp;accurate model with without making it look off in certain parts. Whats more&nbsp;impressive&nbsp;is Lego made this model before the film was released. The set has a nice sand blue and dark blue&nbsp;color&nbsp;scheme,&nbsp;unfortunately rare blue pieces are covered with stickers. Although there are some printed pieces too but most are stickers by this point I've had the set for a while and the stickers are&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;to peel back and fall off, which is why I really hate them. The only minfigure included is the buzz droid which is a nice figure but way&nbsp;over sized, in the movie it was the size of R2-D2's head this minifigure is taller than the&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;R2-D2! The buzz droid fits in nicely with in the dome or the ""brain"" of the Tri-fighter. I really like the set and this one might have gotten over looked because the lack of exciting figures which is true but the Tri-fighter itself is a great model and if you Lego Star Wars I recommend it for its low price and nice model.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>*Review revised on the 10 of March 2011*</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5
"tauntaunwampa","2008-01-17T19:47:32.14Z","Good set","This set is not bad, but it could be better but then again not much else could be done to it to make it better. I was really disapointed when i got this set because i thought that it would automatically shoot out the Buzz Droid which was my favourite droid at the time. I really like the detail in which the front had it really looked like the real thing.

These droids may be small, but they have been known to bring down captial ships! I like the color scheme, but they should get rid of the buzz droids.

"Leggodt94","2008-07-02T18:27:52.513Z","An Ok set ","The whole idea of a tri fighter was pretty creative, I have to give George Lucas that, but LEGO really didn't capture it I guess. I don't know, the model when completed is just too unstable as if it has no foundation whatsoever. Also, the 'ball' thing that holds the buzz droid doesn't stay closed, and the model is a little confusing to construct. The buzz droid itself is cool, and that's about it. Is this set ok? Yes. Is it great? Not really. My suggestion is to not get this. Instead, wait for a remake which I hope that they do. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There are no minifigures with the set, but it includes a buzz droid, that altough cannot move like these on the movie, still good because it works well the legs, like a minifigure, and on each side, there are some circular pieces making it looks like in the movie. The few details are well, these looks like some from the movie. The building of the droid tri-fighter is simple, made with some blocks increased with some fits on the sides, like some pieces used in the landing gears, used currently in some star wars starfighters. These blocks with different shapes are increased with some blue small plates, that have some printed details.

If you compare this set to the droid tri-fighter from 2010 you'll see that this version is much smaller than the newest version.

I know the buzz droid isn't really a minifigure but lot's of people count him as a minifig. The colors of this set are very cool and I like them more than the blue I've seen in the 2010 version.
