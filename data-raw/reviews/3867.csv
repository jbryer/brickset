mainly because you get general grievous, who isn't in any other set. plus is the cheapest way to get obi.

when you heard the price is too high, you'd have heard right.obi-wans mount is kinda boring, but grievous'
bike is awsome.

another thing about this set i noticed was the fact that the lightsabers were gray.

"Monty","2005-06-17T07:24:42Z","Surprised this is a best seller","I have been watching my local stores with interest lately to see which of the new SW Episode III sets are selling quickest. I was not surprised to see the Jedi Starfighter and AT - RT have been selling fast, but I was surprised that this set has sold out in many stores. I suspect this is because it recreates one of the most memorable characters and scenes from the movie. However, I was disappointed with this set as there is not much to it. The lizard is basically a collection of old dinosaur bits with a custom head and feet and the wheel bike is really only 2 clear discs with printing on them, and some custom parts(?) for the legs. The set contains Obi Wan and Grievous Mini figs, which are nice, but very, few parts overall. Due to my disappointment I have not been inspired to make it so far, but I do not anticipate it will take very long if and when I do. I think this is very similar to Mos Eisley Cantina set - not a lot for your money, but no doubt the custom parts justify the price. So far as I’m concerned of all the SWIII sets I currently own this is the worst and the one I dislike the most",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-24T00:50:31.81Z","Good, But Not Great","What first attracted me to this set was (and I think I speak for most people when I say this) the General Grievous minifigure. I also though Boga was cool, but I bought it for Grievous. 

The set comes with some interesting pieces. Aside from all of the Grievous minifigure construction, there are the wheel pieces for the vehicle, and Boga's head. Both these pieces could easily be incorporated into MOCs (as long as you have need for a feathered lizard head), so that shouldn't be a concern if your one who MOCs. It's also noteworthy that the Obi-Wan figure doesn't come with those light-up lightsaberes. Whew!

Construction for Boga is straightforward. Construction for General Grievous's vehicle is somewhat complicated, but shouldn't be too hard to figure out.  

Playability is where I was forced to dock points. While this is a quality set, I'm not really fond of Boga's head. What it really needs is a neck of some sort, because it seems really awkward now. The bike could also use some work. It seems a bit flimsy at times, and the mechanism for deploying the legs could have been a lot better. But this set is good as a display item. 

So overall, the set is quality, but isn't great for playability. Therefore, it earns a 4/5.

I remember getting this set from Target and then my family took me to see the Movie. I loved the Movie and when we were driving home i was just obsessed with the set, looking at every angle eager to open it up and get it started. Anyway i should probably get onto this set. <br><br><h4>Positive remarks,</h4>Personally i love the fact that this set is combined, it makes the set so much more playful and interesting. You receive a lovely Obi-Wan with full Jedi robes and all, Neat face and Brown Cape/Robes. I love this Obi-Wan because i think all the colours and details match and really do him justice. He also has a Blue Lightsaber with a Non-Chrome handle, just a Mild Grey Handle. You also receive the very first General Grievous, which i have to say looks very admirable. He features 4 White arms, a custom Torso with White Battle Droid legs. He has a Custom Head which i personally think looks awesome. He also features 2 Blue Lightsabers and 2 Green Lightsabers.

A saddle type formation for Obi to sit and a Brown sort of 2 Rope Type piece that goes on 2 tubes on the Females Neck, so Obi can control her. I personally think <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Boga</span> looks Outstanding!<br>The Wheel Bike. I love the Wheel Bike. Basically what you do is fold the 4 Legs back underneath the Bike, so intentionally they should now look like 2 legs. This then basically enables you to roll the entire Inner Core formation just like how it is on the Movie. The Bike also features a number of elements which make it look very realistic. Including Printed Clear elements for the Inner Core. Realistic Lego elements to Grip to things and to make it look intriguing.

Then again it would have cost more Money and you can say one thing but actually making it could be a lot more difficult. And also you can say it now however back then there thoughts may have been difference, besides once you make something it's always easier to say what could be improved than make it improved from the beginning. I also wanted Chrome Lightsaber handles which i was slightly disappointed at. I also felt that there could have been something else in the set, and i also thought they could have made some more tiny improvements on the Wheel Bike.<br><br>Apart from these very, and i mean very small ... lets say Suggestive remarks i still find this set to be one of my favourite Star Wars sets full of lovely features.

 minifigs, and then you build the Boga lizard and General Grievous' 
Wheelbike.  
<br>

<br>
The Obi-Wan Kenobi figure is fairly standard, just a tad different than 
the earlier Episode II Obi-Wan figures.  He's got short dark orange hair
 and a bearded stern face.  He has a brown cloth cape and a blue 
lightsaber, and fits well atop the Boga.  
<br>

<br>
The General Grievous figure has the legs of the Battle Droids we've seen
 since The Phantom Menace, a custom torso with four arms, and a 
skull-like head appropriate to the character.  His cloak is similar to 
Obi-Wans, but dark grey instead of brown.  He comes with four 
lightsabers: two blue, two green, taken from slain Jedi.  
<br>

<br>
The Boga is based on pieces we've already seen in the Dinosaur sets LEGO
 put out five years ago, making the organic shapes of it's body as 
modular as other LEGO creations.  It's larger than I thought it would 
be, and includes a feathered beaked head unique to this set.  The reins 
and saddle are flexible and work well, keeping Obi-Wan Kenobi in place, 
and looking ""real"" and functional.  The Boga is made of dark green, sand
 green, and tan bricks, with grey webbed feet--it's a great creature 
that kids or adult collectors will love.
<br>

<br>
The Wheelbike is a unique creation as well.  Part motorcycle, part 
four-legged walker, LEGO's solution for how to build the complicated 
vehicle is to print the details of the gear-like wheel on transparent 
plastic disks.  I know other LEGO-heads don't like that solution, but it
 works for me.  The four legs for walking are on well-designed joints, 
so they can be posed in many positions, and hold those positions.  The 
Wheelbike has several blaster cannons, and a sort of cockpit seat for 
General Grievous to sit on.  It's an easier toy to build than it looks, 
and it stays together once assembled. <br></span></p><p><br><span class=""rkr""></span></p><p><span class=""rkr"">Overall I'd say it's a great set for anyone's collection,<br></span></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"legofan266","2011-07-12T22:58:42.54Z","""I'm Not A Droid!!""","<p><strong>Obi-Won Kenobi (Episode III):</strong></p>
<p>One of the figures in this set, is Obi-won. He is not a very rare figure overall, but I guess this is one of the only Revenge Of The Sith sets that a cape is included for him. Otherwise his pretty simple, I do like how he has orangish/redish legs, because I think they're supposed to be his boots?? A light saber is also included for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>General Grievous (Cape):</strong></p>
<p>This figure is very very rare. He is the same figure that comes in the set 7656. Except one thing is missing in the other set ;P It's the cape!! He has this excusive cape piece which is double sided. It's Maroon on the inside and grey on the outside!! Very awesome cape and it's only ever been in this set. It also has some printing on the grey side of the cape that represents some scratch marks. This figure also comes with 4 lightsaber (2 blue and 2 green) ;D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boga:</strong></p>
<p>The Boga is an exclusive creature that Obi-Won rides on to get to Grievous' hideout. He is a very fast creature and very cool to have as a Lego figure. He is also only in this set, which makes him kind of special. The only thing I didn't like so much was&nbsp;how all his colours are mixed up; he has dark green head with sand green legs and body and there is some tan parts underneath his body, so that looks a bit lame&nbsp;D:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wheel Bike:</strong></p>
<p>The Wheel Bike is also a very unique vehicle. It has some printed parts in the body section along with some guns. It also has a seat for Grievous to sit on&nbsp;and it's really cool how he sits on, there is a stud on back of Grievous' torso just like all the other droid figures. It also has 4 movable legs that can rotate back and foward. The only thing that is sort of disappointing is that there is no storage for Grievous' lightsabers and he can'hold them either because there are handle bars that he has to hold. You also have to take 2 of his arms off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Good set to get, you get 2 pretty rare figures and it's very nice to get Grievous' rare cape, but really there is not much else to it. There are also some cool and printed parts you might want to get along with the 4 lightsabers :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Good figures, especially Grievous</p>
<p>- Lots of cool and printed parts</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- No play features at all</p>
<p>- No storage for Grievous' 4 lightsabers and his 2 arms</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

	<b><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?O=7255-1"">Box</a>:</b></p>
<p>
	The box is exceptionally small for any $20 set and these sort of boxes are used towards sets between 15-20 bucks now.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<b><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=7255-1"">Parts</a>:</b></p>
<p>
	There are some really rare parts in this set, which is why a lot of people want this set. However, the parts are mainly usable for this set and are not that great for MOCs. There are NO stickers in this set and there are 2 printed wheel pieces which are part of the build for Grievous's Wheel Bike. The Boga also has some really rare pieces on it too, like the head for example which only appears in this set, the legs appear in this set and set&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4501-1"">4501</a>.&nbsp;And of course the exclusive and super, super rare cape that is used for Grievous. It's only ever been in this set and not only it has the 2 different sides, but you also have the dark grey printing on the back which either represent torn or scratches from Grievous himself.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<p>
	<b>Build:</b></p>
<p>
	The build was actually pretty quick, a lot faster than you might expect. 111 pieces now days is pretty much a joke for a collector like me, but it was still really fun and enjoyable build. The set took me 10 minutes to assemble.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
	<b>Characters:</b></p>
<p>
	<b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=sw135"">Obi-Wan</a>:&nbsp;</b>This figure is a great addition to any collector out there. You might say that you already have an Obi-Wan, but you can never have too many Obi-Wans! This figure does appear in 6 other ROTS sets, each with a slight different variation. There isn't anything exclusive about this particular Obi-Won, but Obi-Wan with the cape and the hair from ROTS is unique to this set. He does also come with a blue light saber, grey hilt (not chrome).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=sw134"">General Grievous</a>:&nbsp;</b>The white General Grievous (1st gen) is only available in 2 sets, this set and set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7656-1"">7656</a>. In both sets he has the same skeletal torso piece, same flimsy legs and same custom head piece. The only different is that this Grievous comes with an exclusive <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=522px3"">cape</a>, which is double sided. It is maroon on this front and grey on the back. He also has the dark grey pattern on the back, which I've already mentioned in 'parts'. So if you are going to get General Grievous 1st gen, I suggest you get this set so you could have him complete. He does also come with 4 lightsabers (2 blue and 2 green) in order for him to fight Obi-Wan! The light sabers are all grey hilts as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<p>
	<b>Set:</b></p>
<p>
	<b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=51689c01"">Boga</a>:</b> Boga is Obi-Wans vehicle in the movie in order to chase Grievous. It's a good looking animal vehicle, very big and bulky. The parts on the Boga do rotate to give him more pose-ability for easier play. One problem I have with this animal OR vehicle, is that the colors are messed up. He has a dark green head, light green legs, grey tail piece and claws and some tan parts underneath. Fortunately those tan pieces are built manually, so you could easily remove them without noticing much. The Boga though is an exclusive and very rare animal, so that might be another reason you might want this set.</p>
<p>
	<b>- Wheel Bike:</b> The Wheel Bike is General Grievous's vehicle, what he uses to make his getaway in the movie. There are 2 printed pieces on wheels of the Wheel Bike, which I think adds to the accuracy. The legs are also fully pose-able, which adds some very nice&nbsp;play-ability&nbsp;and easy to recreate the movie scene with. There are however a few flaws to the Wheel Bike. The seat can only fit General Grievous and no other figure. So I guess if you want to use the wheel bike for other figures, then you've got it all wrong. Also there is no storage for Grievous's 4 light sabers. This applies to the Boga as well, but there is a way around that problem as Obi-Wan can hold his light saber while riding Boga. But Grievous cannot do that unless he lets go of the handle bars, but then he would get knocked off really easily.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
	<b>Summary:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>
	I think this set is totally worth it as a collectors point of view. This set has 2 exclusive mini figures and an exclusive creature which is great for people who collect mini figures. The Wheel Bike is pretty cool too and is a very nice vehicle to own. You tend to find little mistakes like the light saber storage and stuff (as mentioned), but it's still really cool non the less. If I was to design it, I would make Boga one piece and I would have the side to open up and store my light sabers that way. But again, this set was made 7 years ago and to be honest, I think they did a great job. This set is really expensive and you are expected to pay $160 and over for a brand new one. Sometimes it does go up to $400 as well, depending on where you get it and whether or not it's auction. Buy it if you can.</p><p><br></p>
<p>
	<b>PROS:</b></p>
<p>
	- 2 exclusive mini figures + Boga</p>
<p>
	- Vehicles are really accurate to the movie, both detail and play-ability wise</p>
<p>
	- NO STICKERS!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<p>
	<b>CONS:</b></p>
<p>
	- You can't store Grievous's light sabers, while he's on his Wheel Bike</p>
<p>
	- The colors on the Boga are a little messed up</p>
<p>
	- Pricey</p>

<p>I picked this set up off ebay.&nbsp;100% of the parts in it, but no box. The instructions however were very well and easy to follow through. (Though quite short) There are no questionable color schemes that make it hard to tell which color to use.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There were a few parts that seemed specially molded,(for example, the light grey leg pieces) and many of Boga&#39;s pieces. The parts that make up the General Grievous minifigure&nbsp;are great, consisting of the highly sought after head and torso. Boga&#39;s&nbsp;reigns are an interesting piece, along with his legs and feet, although his head is hollowed out. They combine to make a fantastic&nbsp;model.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great minifigures. As stated before, this set includes the highly sought after General Griecous, with his exclusive cape, featuring the droid army (?) emblem on the back, on a grey background, with red on the inside. Thg torso piece that connects all four arms is a very good piece. Obi-Wan Kenobi is, well, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He includes a regular orange hairpiece, Jedi torso, and normal brown cape. His legs are a nice brown-orange cold though, but overall he looks good.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The construction of the model was quite easy. It took about ten minutes tops, and most parts popped together with an easy &quot;click&quot;. (Referencing to the ball and socket joints) Boga basically stuck together through main parts using technic rods.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Altogether, the model is very nice. Boga has all-potable joints, head, and tail. (His legs swing/click back and forth) The wheels in the center of the wheel bike roll the bike when the legs are folded up, and stand on feet that don&#39;t wobble, but are quite balanced on the &quot;construction drills&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set. Sadly, these days it goes for well over US$100, though I got it at a great price for US $38. The set is a great build, and lots of fun. The creature Boga is a great part of it, and is sadly not included in the 2014 model of the wheel bike. Either way, this set is a fantastic model, and a great addition to any Lego or Star Wars collection.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Great Minifigures</p>

<p>-Animal build pieces</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-No spots to hold light sabers when grievous is in the bike(though he can hold them OK)</p>

<p>-Grievous, like battle droids, has wobbly pieces, though not too loose.</p>

<p>-Very expensive as of 2014.</p>

<p>-Pieces are mainly big, may not go well with other custom builds.</p>
