PROS:
Great Starfighter
awesome droid fighter(way cooler than old one)
Coool gun pecies on both fighters
Awesome Cockpit
good landing gear
Awesome walk mode for vulture droid 
COOL MINIFIGURE!
CONS:
could have better lightsaber storage system
I wanted entire r2d2  not just the head.
Wings are a bit flimsy
all not bad problems at all.


an amazing 9+!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-28T11:27:38Z","Nice Set, but not perfect.","This is the first Episode 3 set released, and its great.

But as I said, its not perfect.

Playabilty wise its great.  You get an Anakin, a Starfighter and a Vulture Droid Fighter.  As a set its self contained.

Here's the skinny:

What I like:

Its simple and quick to build.

Each ship has features.  The Jedi Starfighter has landing gear, and the Vulture Droid (like its Ep1 counterpart) can be in walking mode.

The Vulture Droid is slightly redesigned, so it looks cooler than the previous Episode 1 release.

What I don't like:

Stickers.  I don't mind having to put them on Anakin's Fighter's wings, but you have to apply it to a tile as a computer, and the Vulture Droid's head.  Why couldn't Lego have printed it on the bricks?

The cockpit to Anakin's fighter comes away a little too easily, and I understand it being a complete piece, but why have the little dish to attach to the front?  Just make it part of it LEGO!!!!

Saying that, I do really like this set.  Its not as good as the Arc fighter, but still a fantastic set.

Hopefully next year Lego will re-release it next year, but Obi Wan's red fighter!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T16:41:13Z","The First Episode III Set, But The Best???","I was thrilled three years ago to find the Jedi Starfighter in early release in my local Wal-Mart. I bought it with some money I won from a school contest and immediately saw it as the greatest Lego starfighter ever. The concept of retractable landing gear, totally new to me, was sheer genuis. The detailed parts used for the wings and engines blew me away, and so did all the little details Lego included to make it look like the model. I still own and cherish this set.

Flash forward to February 2005. I just purchased another Jedi Starfighter--Anakin's and the Vulture Droid set, the early release set for Revenge of the Sith. I expected this to be a repeat of the original Jedi Starfighter success. In short, I was right. 

Putting the set together is a breeze, but interesting. For those who complain about stickers, I say get a better control of your shaking fingers. Sure, I have to agree Lego's logic of using decals is odd in some places, but decals are part of an old Lego tradition, and I stand by that. This set gets no loss of points for that. 

The wings were the coolest part of the ship to build. The way they make it look like a TIE fighter is uncanny. The cockpit is great too. I never liked having to remove Obi-Wan's manually. Anakin even has a joystick!

As for the &quot;Vulture&quot; droid, I have compared to my Droid Starfighter from 1999 and find that this is in fact just a revamp of that in new colors. The decals help to make it look cool. And now the ship has discernable lasers, as opposed to its 1999 counterpart.

But the sad part was the peach-skinned Anakin Skywalker. Why oh WHY, Lego, did you commit this heinous crime??? Did Lucas and the licensing contracts force you?? Oh the agony.
Oh well. I just assume Anakin is sick from the dark side and leave it at that.

Overall, this set was an improvement on the great Obi Wan Starfighter of 2002. It shall become a great part of my growing Star Wars collection. Whether or not the ARC-170 can be better, I have yet to see. But for now, this is the best (and only) Episode III set you can get. Get it now!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-17T20:42:14Z","Kickoff to Star Wars Episode III","My Star Wars craze renewed, I have expanded my Lego Star Wars Galaxy with the purchase of this set. I enjoyed building this set. But there are a few things that could have been done to make this set better. First off, I agree with Alexander with the skin coloration of Anakin. I have seen pigs covered in mud look cuter than Anakin. I knowthat this has been done with Harry Potter and the NBA Lego sets, but he looks ill with the coloration. 

The flaps on the starfighter were a dissapointment to me. They are alwaysconstantly moving back and forth and it annoys me. The Vulture Droid looks very similar to the Droid starfighters of Star Wars Episode One. Why bother changing the name of the starfighter for just one movie. It most likely has to do with the arrival of General Grevious (Sorry about the spelling). 

This set has already been in a galatic battle and has not been shot down. It has not given me as much fun as my B-wing, but I have enjoyed playing with it. &quot;Whether or not the ARC-170 can be better, I have yet to see...&quot; but this has been a wonderful introduction to the Star Wars Episode Three Legos.

The Jedi Starfighter is one of the few &quot;machines&quot; in the movie that we actually get to see plenty of. It is pretty accurate, but improvements could have been made to the main cannons (I have produced much better looking ones in black) and the way the smaller ones attach - as they have a tendency to fall off. I can see what they are trying to do with the sloping yellow bricks on the tops of the wings, but at this point it should be flat, and looks better with it flat. R2 benefits from being raised with a white 2 x 2 circular plate, as unlike the previous Jedi Starfighter the droid should have a whole body. Colours seem fairly accurate, but can be improved upon with use of additional grey bricks.  I like the working retractable undercarriage. I hate the stickers – why could they not be printed? – They managed to do this on the much more complex shaped cockpit, but where the stickers are used rest is flat – surely much easier.

"legoclone","2009-06-17T17:29:23.187Z","Finally got Anakin’s Eta","The build was fairly straight forward and on the surface it matches the Obi Wan’s blue Eta Starfighter (set 7661).   I am doing some modifications using that latter set as a guide to bring this one up to par (for one thing I am assuming Anakin’s ship would have been hyperdrive ring compatible as well).   I love the way the Eta-class looks so this one does not disappoint. 

The vulture droid is a bit different from the last 2 released vulture droids (w/ the Naboo Starfighter and Ashoka’s Starfighter).    I don’t like the head and the fact that you have to pull it off to transform it.  At first I didn’t like the wing mounting system but the more I look at it, it makes the vulture droid look tighter when in flight mode so I am considering retro-modifying those other vulture droids as far as their wing go but modifying this one to match their head-mounting system. 

Anyways I am happy to have this set and to have most of the Jedi Starfighters that I want.  I am really hoping the Lego will consider issuing a new updated version of Obi Wan’s Episode II Starfighter but this time to include the hyperdrive ring (c’mom Lego, how about it? …that would be a great set to offer a vehicle that was featured quite prominently in the movies) 

P.S. The Anakin that comes with this is a bit simple compared to the newer ones, with his dot eyes and “Jesus” hair.  Luckily the Clone Wars Anakin comes with about every other set these days so this one is easy to replace.

The Vulture droid was probably the more outstanding on the new parts front, due to its wing parts, body and head being rendered in those Alpha Team shades of dark and light blue.

I'm no fan of the Clone Wars Anikin, but this one is just pure ugly. Also, the wing flaps on the sides sometimes fall of.</p>

<p>Anakin was my first &#39;pink&#39; Lego Star Wars character, and he always looked a little out of place with my Obi-Wans, but otherwise, he wasn&#39;t a bad minifig. His head and hair certainly don&#39;t look a lot like the real Anakin, but, let&#39;s face it, that&#39;s not a bad thing. I liked the way he looked, and, since I got this set long before I saw the movie, that was how Anakin &#39;looked&#39; in my mind.</p>

<p>The biggest disappointment to the 11-year-old me was the lack of Artoo&#39;s body. (However, I soon got around this, and built him a body from a mini-model TIE-fighter which I got free with lunch at Legoland once...). I am glad that the new one has Artoo&#39;s body, but I&#39;m still a bit annoyed about that.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>There wasn&#39;t anything too special about the build, as far as I can remember. The &#39;Vulture Droid&#39; was very similar to it&#39;s predecessor, the &#39;99 Droid Starfighter. Anakin&#39;s starfighter was fairly straightforwards, you built the body, you built the wings, you&nbsp;attached&nbsp;them. Unfortunately, most of the interesting parts were stickers, and stickers do not survive well in the heat and humidity of central Africa.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>Both the starfighters are very swooshable, but the droid one, as always has problems with it&#39;s wings/landing gear. They are a real pain; you have to take them off and then&nbsp;reattach&nbsp;them, offset by one stud, and thenbend the wings down, angling them inwards for stability. Not only that, but you have to remove the head, and put that on top.</p>

<p>If you use Anakin&#39;s landing gear in the way which the instructions say to, his starfighter sits very high off the ground. This is easily fixed. All you have to do is only click the landing gear once, rather than twice, and though it tilts a little upwards, it looks fine. My other complaint with it, however, is the lack of lightsaber storage. I ended up&nbsp;attaching&nbsp;a clip to the back of the wings to hold it, because there is nowhere else convenient to put it--the cabin is huge, but the space is not in the right place; there is nowhere long and thin enough to put it safely.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Well, it wasn&#39;t an amazing or tremendous set, but it certainly made my 11-year old self happy.</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-10T19:28:15.193Z","An excellent pair of fighters... I just wish it had a complete R2-D2.","<p>I got this set back in 2005, when Revenge of the Sith came out, and was 
quite satisfied. I actually wound up receiving a second one for my 
birthday in 2006 from a friend, but I wasn't complaining (the original minifigure
 and Jedi Starfighter had suffered damage and piece attrition, and now I had <i>two</i> Vulture droids). <br></p><p><br></p><p>The set contains two starfighters, the first being Anakin's Eta-2 <i>Actis</i>-class Light Interceptor, better known as a Jedi Starfighter or Jedi Interceptor, in his choice color scheme of yellow and gray. This was LEGO's first outing with the fighter, so there are some flaws, but there are also things it did better than later versions.<br>*It's reasonably sturdy, and accurate, with a nice use of wedge pieces to simulate the beginning of&nbsp; the raised guards around the bulbous cockpit. The main cannons are fairly solid, if a bit simplified from the film (but then, it is a LEGO model). Oddly, they use translucent blue cones rather than translucent green. <br>*The secondary cannons on the sides of the fighter (Which are NOT ion cannons; the ICS book is talking out its arse) are a bit flawed; the newer-model fuel nozzle piece captures the look of the gun okay, but it doesn't always stay in the bracket piece. <br>*The landing legs are good; the front ones aren't mounted where they are in the film but that wouldn't have worked so well with the angled wings in this set.<br>*The S-foils are a new piece created specifically for the job (Making them of separate pieces at this scale would result in something a bit ugly and flimsy), and they do it well. The heat-diffusion inner surface is provided by a sticker. Centering that sticker can be tricky, but it still looks good even if not perfectly centered. About the only problem is that the grips on them can be broken if the set is dropped.<br>*The cockpit upper bulb and hatch are all one piece (making them a two-piece affair would have been less sturdy and less LEGO-y), with the detail printed on them. The spoked viewport that's a precursor to the TIE and TIE Advanced (whom this fighter's bent S-Foils also evoke) is also printed; these were the most important pieces to have detail on (and needed said detail ready to go out of the box), so they got to be tampographed. The emblems didn't need it so much, but they were also tampographed.<br>*The cockpit itself is fairly detailed inside. There's only one joystick (and it's centrally mounted), which is inaccurate, but there's generally a second such piece amongst the extras that can be used to fix that. There's no real place to store Anakin's lightsaber, unfortunately (An easy mod is to use two 1x1 tile-with-grip pieces behind the seat to hold the blade and a 2x4 plate to cover the rest of the hollow behind the seat, securing the hilt below, but still annoying that there was nothing to hold it originally considering how fond this theme has been in the past of secret stash spots) but oh well.<br>*Anakin himself looks alright. His hair isn't the best, but it serves; it certainly is a closer match for his Episode 3 hairstyle than the standard male minifigure hairpiece is for the Padawan crew-cut. He has no cape piece, but that's to be expected from a starfighter set (As many reviewers of 7150 pointed out, keeping a cape on a figure in a cockpit tends to lead to the cape getting badly rumpled, and LEGO noticed this fact as well. The only one to still get a cape in such sets is his future self Darth Vader because, well, he's Darth Vader and it's a required accessory).<br>*R2-D2's dome and its print are, naturally, still the same as they were in his original 1999 appearance. Unfortunately, his dome is all that is included. His body, and the socket for it, are absent from the set. This is perhaps the greatest flaw.</p><p>The other ship is the Vulture Droid (The Episode III era revealed this non-generic-yet-not-the-actual-class-designation name, and I thank it for that) starfighter. It is in primarily sand blue with dark blue accents, perfectly capturing the colors of the CIS livery. Design-wise, it is very close to the individually-sold Phantom Menace droid fighter (and still uses the sloped pieces created for that set's wings). The main differences are: The head uses smooth 4x4 slopes for front and back and connects differently, bracket pieces are used to mount cone pieces that represent the lasers, and the curved front of the body uses 4x4 curved corner pieces instead of 3x3 curved corner pieces with a plate between them. It is designed to be partsformed (Transforming by taking off parts and moving them around) between three configurations. One is a configuration where the wings are closed, concealing the weaponry. The second, done by moving the wing pieces out one stud each from the first mode, is the standard attack flight mode. The third, done by rotating the opened wings downward then unplugging the head and sticking it on top, is the trademark ""Walking"" configuration, which is how these fighters land. The face and CIS logos are stickers. A good representation of the Vulture Droid in its CIS livery, and thus a welcome addition to one's fleet.<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Value for money: The set was $20.00 at its MSRP, the same as the original Delta-7 Jedi Starfighter set, but included two ships.<br></li><li>Includes Anakin Skywalker in his new Episode III duds and hair, and a nice shiny lightsaber<br></li><li>Includes a Vulture Droid, which was always nice in the pre-battlepack era (The full dawn of battlepacks seems to have made it easier to buy villain sets somehow; I don't know how exactly it caused that but it did) because even if you don't buy any strictly-villains sets you still get a villain unit in one of the easily-obtained hero sets.</li><li>The Jedi Starfighter's cockpit opens, and the hinge brick used holds it in position well.<br></li><li>Both ships look good and are very fun to play with</li><li>Most of the pieces can be put to other use (as I've done when I scrapped the Jedi fighter from my first of this set)</li><li>Can be used to army-build droid fighters, and, if you're into color-swapping and/or parts-painting, Jedi fighters too (Random heads can be put on Anakin's body to army-build even Jedi).</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only includes R2's dome, instead of a full droid. Forget a socket; in a pinch I'd have been happy just sticking the body to the underside of the wing! At least I'd have it! This is the biggest flaw in the set as far as I'm concerned. All other flaws can be ignored or modded, but it's kind of hard to ignore or mod a complete absence of an astromech body!<br></li><li>The Vulture Droid's ""Wings closed to conceal weapons"" flight mode was never seen in the films even if it was designed into the CGI model's rigging, and is a bit superfluous on a war-era set of the droid; I'd have rather had the bases of the wings built to allow partsforming to the ""Wings even more open to unveil missiles"" mode instead.<br></li><li>The cockpit has nothing to click onto to hold it closed. Not as bad here thanks to the hinge used, but repeated on later models with a different hinge and it causes trouble there!<br></li><li>Anakin's sleeves should be brown, not black.</li><li>No lightsaber storage built into it, though the modding is easy.<br></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, while there are some places the set is rough around the edges it's still a good set. You get good value for the retail price, and both the ships are good. If you can find it for a good price, you should still get it. Your CIS fleet can always use another Vulture Droid, and the Jedi starfighter can be modified easily enough or have its parts used to help color-convert the redesign from 9494 Anakin's Jedi Interceptor.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

"calzonie","2022-07-05T00:44:06.51Z","Almost Great, but Greatly Held Back by the Times","<p>I have mixed opinions on the Jedi Starfighter and Vulture Droid. I&#39;m going to lay out my problems with it, and it might sound like I hate it, but I genuinely don&#39;t! There&#39;s a lot to like about it, but there are also a few&nbsp;weird problems that hold it back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting off with the minifigures, this set only includes one, an Episode III Anakin Skywalker.&nbsp;As far as I can remember, LEGO Star Wars only used 3 hairpieces for human men&nbsp;prior to The Clone Wars waves (short, long, and Qui-Gon), and this minifig was a great example of why there needed to be more. It just doesn&#39;t look right for Anakin.&nbsp;That said, if you have a lot of fond memories of The Complete Saga, you might&nbsp;find this figure nostalgic enough to forgive it.</p>

<p>It would have been nice if they included a full body&nbsp;for R2-D2,&nbsp;and maybe a buzz droid as well. I don&#39;t want to spend too long wishing for things that aren&#39;t here, but it&#39;s weird that they didn&#39;t include either of those.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build for the Jedi Interceptor looks great overall, but the bottom side of it is blocky, including the landing gear. The Vulture Droid has a similar issue. It looks good from the right angle, but the standing position in particular leaves some white and tan parts exposed that stick out like a sore thumb among the blues and grays.</p>

<p>I rated the building experience pretty low, and I stand by that,&nbsp;BUT&nbsp;the&nbsp;experience could be completely different for you. If you buy the set from eBay or Bricklink, and it comes with the instruction manual, you&#39;ll probably have a fine time with it. Unfortunately, I lost all but the front cover of my instruction booklet a long time ago, so I was relying on the PDF scan&nbsp;provided through Brickset to find the parts I needed. This is a problem with more sets than just this one, but the PDF scan&nbsp;is not good enough. Most colors are a little off, but some darker&nbsp;colors can be difficult to tell apart (black and grays were a big problem, but&nbsp;browns and reds were sometimes bad as well).&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to use video reviews of the set on a few occasions to figure out what color a certain piece was supposed to be. That was frustrating and made some parts of the building process take longer than they should have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to finish my complaining with a couple of quick things.&nbsp;This was before instructions would tell you what pieces you need for each step, so you have to keep a close eye out for small pieces being added&nbsp;and stickers suddenly being applied to parts that had already been attached to the build for several pages. And speaking of the stickers, when you transform the Vulture Droid between its different forms, it&#39;s very easy to end up scraping the stickers on the 2x2 tiles and&nbsp;chip&nbsp;them if you aren&#39;t careful, especially if it&#39;s a used copy&nbsp;where they&nbsp;already show some age.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t hate this set. I gave it 4 stars for a reason! Even with&nbsp;the issues it has, the end result looks good. I love the yellow and less common shades of blue, plus the printed dish pieces for the Republic! For whatever reason they don&#39;t print those&nbsp;anymore. And those black pieces that hold the guns on the sides of the Starfighter are really versatile for attachable minifigure equipment, I couldn&#39;t get enough of those as a kid!&nbsp;These ships look good on display (but put them on a low&nbsp;shelf for a better angle) and they&#39;re fun to swoosh around.&nbsp;I would recommend this set if you&#39;re considering it, just make sure you&#39;re getting the instruction booklet!</p>
