"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T13:47:01Z","Diorama ","This is a diorama Star Wars set that aspires to have some action capability like the Lego Sports sets.  It is clearly better as a diorama.  The set looks good but playability is lame.

Highs
1. Light up lightsabers! 
2. A new Anakin minifig.
2. Trans orange parts (especially the wall).
3. Great light gray &amp; brown 1/2 cylinders parts for Space.
4. Diorama is cool looking.

Lows
1. Modest playability.
2. Mini fig heads turn too easily.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-12T15:48:42Z","The fate of Anakin Skywalker lies in the hands of you with this cool set!!!","A cool set.  Comes with exclusive characters, and the setup lets you duel your friends.  This set could use a little work though, like making it a little bigger.  The light-ups kind of suck for this set because you can't take it apart a lot.  In the movie, Obi-Wan chops of both of Anikin's legs and his left arm, and you cannot do that with the light-up Anakin, but you can get the beaten up one in the Darth Vader Transformstion, which is a good addition to this set.  Over all though, this is a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-16T23:20:25Z","Meh","I'll give the Lego company kudos for trying to make this set. It wasn't that great, but not bad, either. The only reason people should buy this is for the parts, which aren't really that great anyway. You could spend that $45.00 on another set that contains better pieces. But I suppose, smaller children could get some fun out of this.

Also, I find it funny, Omega, that you can't even spell &quot;grammar&quot;. =P",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-05-29T08:54:51.993Z","Unfortunate","This is quite an irony, because I bought the set with my own money and yet regretted intensely soon after. The set has very poor construction and is very inaccurate movie wise. Sure, alot of great parts are at your disposal, but that's about it. The figures look great, but are gimmicks on the whole, along with the so-called &quot;play system&quot;. The duelling doesn't work for nuts, the whole thing holding up very poorly. The &quot;special features&quot; are also very weak in this set: I mean, you actually have  to push down the pillars! At least pulling a pin or something would've been that much more fun. So yes, the set is extremely and unnecessarily expensive. the only saving grace are the plentiful trans-orange pieces, but even the allure of that wears thin. Don't get this one.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-21T18:46:23.717Z","...","I just don't like it overall, the lightsabers are connected to the hands, and you can't twist it. The lego dude who made this must have an unscrewed bolt in his head, because this set is so horrible! also, don't foret the mace windu and luminara, you can't take off thier heads, cant move the hands, and cant take off the lightsabers! Now, even worse, the place doesn't even look like mustafar, because of its &quot;falling lava&quot; thing, and the sticks to move ani and obi, it just doesn't look right!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

                  -falls apart easily 

I really should give it a 1, but since it is a mustafar set which makes it a little good I'm giving it a 2.

"asianlego","2008-10-03T14:40:16.043Z","Ultimate Lightsaber Failure","This set is probably the Ultimate Star Wars Set That No One Wants. This is because this lacks features and it seems that other reviewers are nodding in unison as well. The lightsabers are non-removable! And the place looks nothing like Mustafar where the actual in-movie battle takes place. And I doubt that any kid would want to play a 2-player battle with you (He'll think you're a weird person). However the lightsabers can light-up and I see this as a great feature (In the Toysrus discount section the box had alot of tears and damage and the 'Try Me' hole where you could play with the Lightsaber was heavily torn due to heavy play by non-buyers)

THIS SET.....I'd rather drop it off a cliff than build it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
It should take about an hour or so to build this set. It took 2. How? THE POSTS FELL DOWN SO EASY, THE CHARACTERS WILL FLIP UPSIDEDOWN, THE STICKS THAT CONNECT THE MAIN PART WITH THE THREE OTHER PLATFORMS FALL APART SO EASY!

"UFO_and_Insectoids","2009-12-23T22:05:40.513Z","Final Battle!","This set is okay, but in my mind they could of done a little better, or at least made it bigger. I mean after all, it was the biggest lightsaber duel in the history of Star Wars.

Pros:
*Good minifigs with glowing lightsabers
*Cool design of set
*Different contraptions and mechanisms

Cons:
*Minifigure stands are flimsy
*Minifigs can tip over easy
*Could have been bigger or had more to it",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-04-07T18:16:24.857Z","go Obi!","I think they could have excluded the light up lightsabers because the lightsaber hand doesn't move, the head and legs don't separate, and the heads slide around a lot. Sadly, I lost Obi-Wan's hood, but I found some brown hair. The capes are okay. the towers fell down all the time. the flames have been very useful when I make MOCs, which is every day, unless I'm on vacation and don't have any pieces with me. The handles are annoying, too. The lava balls always slid down when they weren't supposed to. A lot of good MOCinf pieces.

"Z_wing","2009-08-06T07:31:10.7Z","it's not that bad","I understand that people hate this set but I do not think it is that bad

figures
pros: lightsabers light up
cons: lego should not put a ""try me"" feature on the box because non buyers run the batteries out

mustifarian landscape
pros: figures can be controlled by the sticks, ""lava"" can be tipped, the pillars can fall down
cons: it is hard but possible to knock the pillars down with the figures but very easy to knock down with your hand during building, figures always turn upside down when not on a surface, you need two people to control both sticks 

platform (not shown in the picture)
pros: looks nice
cons: none

pieces
pros: rock piece
cons: none

build
pros: sort of easy, sort of strong
cons: none

price
pros: worth it
cons: none

I recommend this set to any star wars fan 
I hope you found my review helpful

The two-player feature is crud, the platform is supposed to have four pylons, not three, and the character costumes are inaccurate.</p>
<p>That's the negativity outta the way. This set has some attributes, and they are mainly centred in the parts. We've got some outstanding lava pieces here, as well as a bit of mountain and some platform parts that you just know are gonna come in handy in a MOC. The light-up lightsaber feature is also mrkedly cool, though the sabers are attached to the figure. No wonder they got discontinued...</p>
<p>There you have it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pros:</li>
    <li>Very little, other than the parts on offer- cool!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Cons:</li>
    <li>Every feature of the set is boring and uneffectual</li>
    <li>Not worth the price</li>

"legofan266","2011-07-12T23:55:42.13Z",""" You're Underestimate My Power!!""","<p><strong>Obi-Won (Light Up):</strong></p>
<p>This Obi-Won is exclusive to this set. There have only been a few light up minifigures and this is one of them. The problem with all the light up figures is that you can't take there head, torso or legs apart. The fuction works like this: When you push his head down, his lightsaber lights up. The fuction works quiet well, although you have to change the batteries every now and then. This figure is the exact same figure as the 7255, except he has a hood instead of hair and he has a light up lightsaber!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anakin Skywalker (Light Up):</strong></p>
<p>Just like Obi-Won, this figure is also exclusive to this set. He is a bit different to the one in set 7256 just with a different head (he doesn't have the headset) and also he has a light up lightsaber. Again, if you push down on his head, his lightsaber lights up. He only appears in this set and both the figures are very unique, especially this one!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lava:</strong></p>
<p>Not much to the actaul set itself, it has some nice play features&nbsp;though; when you put a figure on a turntable, you can pull the lever back and foward and you can spin the grear to spin the figure, so it would the figure in action ;P You can also make the bridge collapse, there are 3 long pieces sticking upwards and you simply push on it and they fall reacting the movie scene. There are lots of detail for the lava part of it, such as the burning rocks, same piece as set 7199. There are also some rocks that you can tip on the figures. The flame detail is also really good (could of used some of those bigger flame pieces like the set 7199).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The set is really cool, the only that you can get 2 light up figures in. Also cool to get some of the lava pieces and best of all, if your young and you play with your Legos, then you can play with a friend!! Also it's a bit expensive these days... maybe look around a bit before you buy one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- 2 exclusive light up figures</p>
<p>- Lots of cool pieces including lava pieces</p>
<p>- Cool gear system to recreate the movie lighsaber fight scene</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- The 3 sections that meet the main part are a bit boring to build</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

"Pajamaman360","2020-01-06T13:08:37.677Z","Quite Dissapointing","<p>This set (which cost me about 60 dollars when I was 11 or 12), was the most money I had ever spent on anything before. However, when I built the set I discovered that it was little more than an action-figure style-playset&nbsp;with few options for additional play beyond the intended setting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set reminds me more of a Rokem-Sockem Robots set, with an arena, two fighters, and not much else to play with. Other sets can be more easily added to or played with in different ways, but this was barely a LEGO set, in my opinion.</p>
