"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-30T18:33:10Z","very very cool","I thought this set was awsome the mini spider droid is sweet, I realy realy like the droid tank its sweet, and I love those wookies! But I didn't realy like that wookie flying thing it looks pretty dumb. And the other bad things about this set was that the set's instructions were comletely messed up, it started at step 1 and went up to step 16 then it repeted steps 14 to 16 again then it comletely skipped over steps 17 to 28, so I just built the set from the picture it gave me on the box.(it wasn't hard.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-01T09:38:32Z","VERY nice! (Wookies!)","This is my second Episode III set I built. I got it a little early with the Clone Scout Walker. 7258 and 7250 pair together very nicely. The Dwarf Spider Droid is a new feature however, the eyes/cannon duo doesn't really attach as much as I wanted, and the main head thing doesn't swivel that much, (you can fix the swivel easly, by the way) but it still rocks! This set comes with a &quot;Wookiee Flyer&quot;, as LEGO calls it. As one of the first Wookie ships, it's amazing! It IS a little dissapointing that the ONLY defense is a back cannon, but it can turn into a full turret, so i'm O.K.. The &quot;Corporate Alliance Droid&quot; as LEGO calls it, is nicely well done(??). The way droids enter and exit is unique for a droid/tank thing. The droid sometimes falls out, so be careful. Building the tread is not that hard. Just snap together 69 little pieces!! Watch the tread it falls off the track sometimes too. all in all, great set. P.S. A good idea probably would be to get this set with the Clone Scout Walker.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-03T16:34:02Z","cool, u gota love those wookies","i love the spider droid its pretty arcuate little to smal, tank is ok, good design but i cant get treads to work!i think im missing 1 of those litttle black pieces for it.minifigs are must haves thats the main reason i bought the set! way better than wookie cartaman but that has that cool hover ship for the clones

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-10T18:35:34Z","A really neat set, especially for the mini-figs!","This is my first of the episode three sets. I chose it because it was'nt too expensive and I am a droid and Wookie fan (: The spider droid is neat and the way the eyes and gun are connected is creative and keep it to scale. The large corporate alliance take seemed small on thr box, but it is actually impressive with it aggresive and animal look. It is good  that they did not use an akward rubber tread and opted fot the chain links.
 The wookie flyer is the weakest part of the set. One rear gun and all these antennaes that constanly fall off. The wookie figs rock though. I added more battle droids and my two chewies to play out my own battle for Kashyyyk.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-23T23:31:35Z","Excellent!","Highs:
-the Corporate Alliance Droid (aka &quot;tank droid&quot;)is incredibly accurate, based on images i've seen from Ep. III.
-the dwarf spider droid is cute, and can interact with Ep. II lego sets, since it appeared in Ep. II as well
-the new tread pieces from the Corporate Alliance Droid   allow the Droid to move with surprising speed on carpets, and other &quot;traction-y&quot; surfaces.
-the wookiee flying machine doesn't look as lame in person as it does on the box :)
-A very high piece count for 29.99 (366 pcs. included)

-the wookiee flying machine is still rather ugly",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2005-05-30T12:49:28Z","Good, but a little awkward","This is an odd set. It comes in a big box which is deceptive as there does not seem to be much in it. When you spread out the parts there still doesn’t seem to be much. It makes up into 3 main items - the spider droid, corporate alliance tank droid and wookie flyer. The spider droid is easy to make, just having a few parts, but looks good. The wookie flyer is a little unwieldy and awkward to construct with numerous “whiskers” sticking out and doesn’t seem that strong. However, it can be played with and the 2 wookie minifigs are nice. The main part of the set (and my main reason for buying it) is the corporate alliance tank droid. This is awkward to construct – especially the rotating hinged opening side mechanisms that also contain the side armament and antennae . This allows access to the cockpit so 1 of the set’s 2 battle droids can be placed inside. I suspect a world war one tank inspired the designers of this vehicle as the track wrap right around the vehicle. It has to be made up from separate links - 69 in all which should leave one spare. Once they are in place they work well, provided you ensure there is no fouling on the parts that attach the sides. From the all too brief glimpses in the movie, all the elements of this set look very accurate, (as do all the Episode III sets I have made reviewed so far – well done Lego) and despite first impressions I like the set and think it is just about worth the money. To be fair to Lego, as one of those who has criticised their excessive prices in the past  - especially on SW items, the Episode III sets do seem reasonably priced. No doubt lots of people will buy it just for the track(s) parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Manxboi24","2007-08-13T10:35:47.457Z","Great set! ","This is one of the best LEGO sets for Episode 3. The CAD is great but the track on it is awkward and snags ,breaks, or just leaves the wheels it moves on. The Spider Droid is great ans accurate to the film. The wookiee tank is not my favourite thing and for me, breaks at the touch of something but is still pretty good. The set itself is oddly named as there is more droid stuff then wookiee stuff. A name like Attack on Kashyyyk would be better. But overall, I would give it a 9/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The structure is strong too. The wookie vehicle is okay but not too strong and it breaks really easily. It looks strange, but the wookie minifigures are nice. Sometimes the pictures in Lego magazines made it look like the one on the gun was Chewbaka, but it really isn't. It also looks like there is a droid in the tank, and the set has three droids, but there are only two. The spider droid is cool and stays together well.

"starwarsgeek101_","2010-02-16T21:08:49.233Z","Top notch army builder","<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>7258 Wookie Attack is a set not like many others, because not only for its price, but for the variety of ships and minifigs you receive in it. The build is a bit tiring, mostly because of connecting the 69&nbsp;pieces to make the tread for the&nbsp;tank&nbsp;droid, but&nbsp;LEGO does keep you intersted&nbsp;throughout the build. The wookie flyer can be pretty fragile although the 8 antennae seem to not be as much of a problem as I expected. The Tank Droid is extremely strong and will probably not fall apart.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>You receive 4 minifigures in this set; 2 hard-to-get wookiees and 2 battle droids. They are all very nice and are very detailed and movie-accurate. The battle droids receive 2 ion blasters and the wookies pilot the flyer, which has a weapon built in it. The spider droid is very unique. It is very stiff and much more stable compared to the 2008 version of the spider droid (7670). One battle droid will pilot the tank which is one detail I think made this set great.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p><i>Playability</i>: 10/10. There is no stop to the fun you can have with the movable tank and the wookie flyer battling along with the battle droids and spider droid.</p>
<p><i>Building experience</i>: 7.5/10: Although there are some rare pieces to discover, there is also the dreaded step in building the tread, which can take a while.</p>
<p><i>Parts</i>: 10/10: There are many exclusive pieces to this set. The easiest example is the orange plating printed with designs on the tank droid. There are also many hard-to-get pieces in this set, especially the brown pieces on the wookiee flyer.</p>
<p><i>Value for Money</i>: 10/10: For $30&nbsp;you get what is mentioned above plus an army builder for your other sets. You can easily get 2 or 3 of these and make an entire battle.</p>
<p>A very nice set which I consider you to get,&nbsp;even when you look at the price for these nowadays.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"P13c30fch33s3","2009-06-29T03:38:34.437Z","The first Tank Droid","As I said in the title, this is the first tank droid Lego made.
If you hate long reviews, skip to the bottom.

The tank droid is made up of a base section with other parts attached to it as the instructions continue. The front section actually conceals a battle droid seat for a pilot. The treads are very boring to make, because there are lots of them.The wedge-shaped section is quite sturdy and is connected to the bottom with a 1X2 brick with a single stud on top. Occasionally, I find that the rear wheels fall off because they are not connected in a particularly sturdy way.

Overall, I like the tank droid because it is the first Lego have built and the construction is generally solid, but the playability score is damaged by the rear wheels and the fact that the treads sometimes jam.

The Dwarf Spider Droid is also a first for lego, even though it appeared in Ep II as well. The leg section is sturdy but unsettling (for me) because it is not symetrical and (in my opinion) not as good as the new one. The eyees are held on in a simple way but it is sturdy.

Unfortunately, even though it is quite a good addition to your collection, I do not like it because of what lego has done to make the legs point in four directions. what may look like a main part of the hull at the back is actually hinged and creates something like wings.

The Wookie Flyer is quite interesting in the way it is built and is surprisingly sturdy. The rear cannon is simple but effective, but tends to fall off in rough play. One thing I would definetely complain about is the use of antennae in the set. There are 11 of them! Eight of these are on the Flyer itself acting as what looks like helicopter blades. This is really annoying because they constantly fall off and are annoying to put back on.

This part of the set was ruined by the use of antennae as helicopter blade-like things. If not for the antennae, it would have been a much better part of the set.

There is nothing to say about the battle droids. There are two, but they do not use the new arm piece and still hold backwards megaphones as guns.

Pros:
Tank is sturdy
Tank & Spider Droid are a first
Wookie flyer is quite good(in terms of construction, space and sturdiness)
Battle Droids

Cons:
Treads tend to jam
rear wheels tend to come off
legs are supported in an unsymetrical and unsettling way
ANTENNAE! Never use too many unless they are well supported

Overall, a good army builder set but the details drop the fifth point.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jjr","2009-01-18T13:10:30.403Z","The best in my memory ","I know it like it was yesterday when I saw some blurry pics of the prototype set, and I really thought wow I want that tank! and after trying to build it myself (wich didn't work) I was waiting months before it was on the online shop and I immediatly decided to order it. I was so happy when it came

I started with the spider droid, it was nice for that time but the new one is much better. after that the tank, the main feature in the set. looked like a really cool tank, and yes it had some flaws but wich set don't? the wookie thing was for me just not much, but the two wookies are a nice addition

"TristanC","2010-07-25T12:29:23.653Z","Overall a great set and value for money","<p>First off I just want to say that this is a great value for money. You get a tank droid, wookie flyer, a mini-spider droid, two battle droids and two wookies. Now I will review the set.</p>
<p>The tank droid is nice as it is the same as in the movie, unlike the newer version. The side panels lift up to reveal a small cockpit that swings out. It's a pretty good addition to a collection, and the side panels are very rare (this set only). Unfortunately the back wheels often fall off, the treads jam, and are a pain to connect and easy to lose. Once the tread of mine broke and pieces of it got scattered throughout my lego bins and my house. It took me over a year to find it all.</p>
<p>Next up is the mini-spider droid. I don't have much to say as it is so small, but it's pretty cool. My only problem with it is that the legs are positioned oddly.</p>
<p>The wookie flyer is really nice in my opinion, because it allows lots of wookie/droid conflict. The wookie warriors are nice and quite rare. The flyer itself is good, with a spot for a pilot in front, and a spot for a a gunner (with mounted gun) in back. The antennae are a bit odd, but i have no problem with them, as I'm pretty sure it's in the movie. There is only one small flaw, and that is that the mounted gun in back cannot rotate, it can only go up and down, but that is easily modified.</p>
<b>Pros</b>
<ul>
    <li>Nice tank droid with opening cockpit</li>
    <li>Nice mini-spider droid</li>
    <li>Nice wookie flyer</li>

<b>Cons</b>
<ul>
    <li>Back wheels fall of and treads are a pain on the tank droid</li>
    <li>Back gun on wookie flyer does not rotate</li>

And finally the Flyer. The flyer is the only version they ever made, but its really great! Its like a army builder all in itself! It has two worriers, one in the front and one manning the gun.
