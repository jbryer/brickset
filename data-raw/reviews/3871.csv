"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-28T07:53:20Z","Great Ship, Great Load of Minifigs!","The second Ep3 set I've got and its fantastic.

You get 3 Clone Pilots (the only set these figures come with) and a Astromech Droid.

It has fantastic features like dropping bombs, and the wings open in a really interesting way.

The construction is broken up into 3 segments, the main body and the two wings.  Which makes it all a lot easier.

It also has lots of pieces, Lego's not scrimped in this one, and it'd make it great for customising.

In fact if you own the huge Lego dropship from Ep2, this could be used to bulk it up.

Its a fun set, and if the rest of Ep 3 sets are as good as this and the Jedi Starfighter, then I'm a happy bunny.

   The build structure is clever, as is the bomb drop (you load the bombs in between the 2 front cockpits then press a gear at the back!.
  The only down point is the astromech droid inbetween the 2 back pilots. Its legs are headrests!! Oh well, no biggie!
  In all, a brill set, and thankfully, no stick on decals!

The 3x pilot minifigs are good, a cross between clone troopers and at-at drivers. You also get a R5-D4 type droid. The set instructions are easy to follow and the wings swivel like the latest x-wing set. There are 2 bombs similiar to the way slave 1 drops them.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-04T12:04:46Z","Good, but may get better","Normally I would review a new Star Wars set based, amongst other things, upon its accuracy to the “real” version, as accuracy to prototype is normally one of my key indicators. As we still have some time to wait for Episode III, I can only review it now without that comparison. As has been said it has nice new Minifigs and the same clever wing opening mechanism as the X – wing. In terms of construction and to look at it is good. It has no stickers so that has got to be a major point in its favour. Also the cost was not too high at 30 GBP. 

I think I can only really give it an eight for now, but once I have seen the movie, I may be back with a revised score. Can’t wait for the Clone Turbo Tank and the Scout Walker.

However I have knocked a couple of points of because mine didn't come with either figures or computers which was frankly very disappointing. I intend to get in contact with Lego over this. Has anyone else had this problem? Mine bought from Argos, Birmingham. Sort it out Lego!!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-17T10:17:22Z","Good set, even better with minor adjustment.","Hi everyone,

Received this set a few days ago and now I have had time to appreciate it here's a few little points of interest.

The pilot helmets have hollowed out eye areas. It's the black, blank minifig heads underneath that make the eye areas of the helmet appear black. This is of significance in that it means you can put a human faced minifig head under the helmet instead. Why would you want to do this? Well... It appears from the ROTS trailer and a preview of a Clone Pilot 3.75 inch action figure that you can see pilots human eyes so movie accuracy can be established.

It's a real bonus that there are no decals with this set at all considering the Jedi Starfighter and Vulture droid set was littered with them. The two targeting screens included with the ARC-170 have a nice print of what must be a droid tri-fighter on them. Great touch.

On to the gaps in the cockpits. Only the two rear gunner cockpits are hinged. The third foremost cockpit is fitted in place. There is a small gap behind this but this is a necessary play feature to allow you to drop the &quot;bombs&quot; into the bomb bay in the centre of the ship. However, when you build it, according to the instructions, you find that the two hinged cockpits do not sit flush to the main hull of the ship unlike the fixed one. It looks messy and means the two rear pilots sit considerably lower than the front one. 

This can be rectified easily with only a slight loss in rigidity of the model. You simply have to remove two, white 4 by 1 flat pieces which sit adjacent to the R2 unit and four grey L-shaped pieces which the two canopy hinges sit on. This has the effect of lowering each canopy down by &quot;1&quot; flat layer ensuring that each canopy sits flush to the hull. You can use the white excess pieces for strengthening the area weakened by the removal of the small L plates. The L plates can then be used as a platform for sitting the targetting computer which will need repositioned slightly. The only drwaback with this is that the hinged cockpits require slightly more care when opening but it looks a whole lot better when displayed in closed position.

With this modification made, the set improved greatly in my eyes. Well worth picking up and quite reasonably priced as it turns out to be relatively big. At least three times the size of the Jedi Starfighter. Quite an unusual looking ship, my girlfriend thinks it resembles a giant seagull and I can see her point.

It really could do with landing struts though! Display is quite hard in closed s-foil mode and nigh on impossible with them open!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's just amazing how it works.  Other than that, the minifigs are great, and the overall construction is solid, excluding some minor quibbles with the smaller wings falling off, but it's only happened once or twice.  My only problems with the set are that there is no landing gear, not that there always should be, but it would of been nice.  Secondly, it seems the long mechanism that fastnens the wings together has to be slightly bent or all the parts wont snap together.  Not a big bend at all, but it is a minor annoyance.  Other than that though this is a great set and I strongly recommend it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-04T16:42:32Z","My Other April 2nd Purchase....","...and let me tell you, it is excellent. And I was impressed with the new 2003 X-Wing design. The ARC-170 blew me away in piece count and playability. 

Building the set is fun. It is not too boring or tedious, except on the wings. That part I did the second time barely glancing at the instructions. I had to ask myself, though, when building the cockpits for the upper level, whether a 4-stud bender piece couldn't have been used instead of a 2-stud one. The cockpit would still fit, and then it would be &quot;airtight.&quot;

But that does not bother me too much. The clone pilots are awesome minifigs, despite their lack of mouth lines on the helmets. And the Astromech droid placement is clever. 

I give this set a nine because of its size. For a space-consceincious collector like me, fitting the ARC-170 next to the AT-AT, the 2004 Millenium Falcon, the X-Wing Fighter, and the AT-TE is a bit of a squeeze. For a set as great as this though, I will MAKE room. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

l become catch sight on this one
spent about US$30 to buy(discounted Price, so lucky)
spent about 3 hours to finish

the lovely clone pilots are attracted me too

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-16T15:34:22Z","Greatest thing ever!","       If you were satisfied with the 4502 x-wing fighter, than you will love this thing!  This has around 180 less pieces than 4502 but the craft is just as good.  You get 3 good minifigs, the republic clone pilots with printed torso, new hemet, and light blue pants and arms. You get two blaster rifles (Megaphones) for the pilots. The ARC-170 (Aggressive Recon Craft) I think, is manned by 3 pilots. The person up front is the commander and pilot. The person on top and behind the pilot is the Weapons Systems Officer or Electronics Warfare Officer or navigator.  The back guy facing the opossite way is the flank gunner and he controls a cool turret gun.  It has large wings with the tendency to break, but on the edge of these wings are 1 large laser cannon each, and 1 smaller AA cannon. It can also carry bombs which sometimes dont work! Much like the TIE Bomber, which disgusted me today in battle.  This set is the best. Nice wing swinging design almost identical to x-wing.  The front s cool and it is a good build with multi computers. It also comes with an astromech doid, red, an R4or R5 series. &quot;Damn, I wish they could come out with new colors).

Cons: Umm, do I HAVE to have a con?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T18:35:41Z","Interesting Set, Amazing Quality","When I first ordered this from my bi-monthly lego catalog, I was very anxious to get this. Once I did, it was a great pain to build. (The technic mechanisms built in take some tedious time to build, but well worth it when you finish.)

Onto the Set. It looks a lot like a Republic Gunship and X-Wing Fighter fused into this Fighter/Bomber. The wing mechanisms are a bit ridiculous, you would have to rely on 2 small orbs that turn in order to open the wings, which are pulled together by a rubber band. At times, when you're opening it, you might hear a snapping sound, which indicates the orb won't turn because part of the wing is stopping it. Also, the front pilot cockpit has no computer which is a bit stupid, since he'll just be sitting there doing nothing. Though, they left a small space. I guess they want you to put in your own computer/controls. That or my set just missed that part.

Now, onto the pros. The 2 cockpits in the back are excellent, they open up very easily and allow you a lot of space to fit in the clones. I think the headrest from the astromech droid looks pretty awesome. The bombing feature- excellent. A small space for the bombs to slide in through the set and then with a pull, bomb enemy ships or whatever. The supposed Turbine Engines right by the front pilot cockpit look great and turn as if they're actually working. The Laser Guns are a nice addition, especially with 2 on each end.

The color is also just right- deep red and white. A very realistic Star Wars set. Couldn't be better; well, except for the wing mechanism. It's also not airtight, but it's easy to make it so with a few adjustments of your own.

Overall, it should be a set worth blowing the 40 dollars. If you're thinking about buying it, do it.  You won't regret it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The clone pilots are very good, I got six for some reason!!! The computers are also nice although I wish there was one for the pilot. That however is the only downfall.

I got this a day ago and started building it about 3 hours ago. It has nice swooshability but some flaws made me cry!  The damn technic pieces! One bar was too long and made an engine look wierd.  I hate technic pieces.  The engines are wickedly cool. I love the clone pilots and the cockpits are awesome. The Aggressive Recon Craft-170 is a very nice thing. Besides the swarm of shootin' technic pieces, the two minor wings that can supposedly go up or down, I didnt put them on!  I did at first, but when I turned the thing, they went sideways and looked horrid.  The cockpit wall can come out and I put some extra controls in the fron pilot cockpit.  There is just one big wing and the bomb-dropping mechanism is twice as good as the TIE Bomber's one.  The large lkasers on the wings are cool and I used pieces from the mainor wings to strengthen the main wings. It looks awesome and I love making it do barrel roles and split-es's. Nothing breaks when I do it, super playability and now you can actually drop bombs without something breaking. Oh so great!  It did cost me 40 USD but I think it will serve me well.  I combined this and the Republic Gunshio for a devastating Republic airforce.  This is very nice, get it but beware of some technical difficulties and some wing maufunctions.

The box is simple. The front displays an image (I think the above, could be wrong) of the ARC with the familiar episode III box design. The back of the box (again, I believe but could be wrong) displays an image of the functions: Opening wings, dropping bombs, etc. 

There are two pieces among this entire set that really stand out. They are the worm gear, and the box it comes in. I believe they are exclusive to this set because I haven't hear of their use anywhere else. It also comes with three Clone Piolets, which unless I am mistaken, are only available in this set the V-Wing. 

The build for this set is fairly easy, although A tad complex when it comes to putting together the system for the wings lifting up and down. It takes some time to get right, but not a lot. 

The finished product has a few minor problems to it. One of them are the wings. They are thin, have a big hole in them, and tend to break somewhat easily (although this makes for better crash scenes if your a role-player :) ). The other problem is that if you want to display the ARC with the wings up, then you need to make a custom stand for it. Otherwise the wings will snap off if you set it down. 

This set is good both as a item for play and an item for display. It has great functions like wing openings and bomb droppings, and is fun to play with. If you manage to build a stand for it, you could display it with the wings open, which can look stunning.

Although not a fan i have purchased a few models from the Lego series as they looked cool others were gifts. This particular model was a gift from my gran and i actually forgot i had it. Found it 2 days ago behind a pile of dvds in the cinema room.

Down to the review, This thing looks cool, obviously. It is alot bigger than the box suggests, slightly flimsy but its got to fly. Such detail in the rocket engines (im assuming) and the characters helps point out this sets quality. 

The wings ever so cleverly expand and contract by an easy reach gear at the back which really enhance this model. guns fire power the works for you weapon obsessed ones. Drops bombs which is a bloody sweet design, Even a robot (i think).

The only con there is, is the fact the front hatch isn't on a hinge even though the other 2 are? Another late night rush job by the Lego team :S

Enjoy!

and the visors should be painted onto the helmets, not just a hole. This is still a fun set to play with, and goes well with my other clone and droid ships. OH! and one more thing: make sure the wings are together before you put the set down. Otherwise, this set if a pretty good set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Delka","2008-08-01T23:11:14.2Z","Best Ep. III set!","    I love this set. It's the best starfighter I have. The main body flows nicely, but the wings could've been covered up more in some spots. Onto the overview.
     
WINGS: The wingspan is huge, the widest of all of my fighters. The wings are pretty sturdy by the engines of the ship, but the plates on the main wing come undone from the red ones every once in a while. The engines are nice and big in the front but taper away to nothing in the back. How can two tiny florscent orange pieces propel a huge fighter?  The gears right next to the engines could've been covered up more and they make it look kind of ugly. The s-foils work awesome and look good when up. But when they are up, it exposes the big hole in the wing. That can be easily fixed though. Also I think that LEGO should've tried harder to get the s-foils to go up faster.

BODY: The body is the best part because it is the sturdiest and sleekest. The nose has a cool design and is very creative. The pilot cockpit is ok, but could've been better. There are gaps in the back of the cockpit, but that is essential to the bomb mechanism. The pilot sits at the right height, but he has no controls to fly the ship and is kind of cramped, unlike the others. This cockpit should be hinged too. The first cockpit flows into the second well. The second cockpit is bigger than the first and has a targeting screen. There is a space in front of the minifig's feet that is open to the bomb chamber though. This pilot is not at the right height. The droid is nice and its head pops out just the right amount. The rear gunner is not at the right height, but has a targeting screen. The swiviling gun is smooth. The bombs are nice but fall out when the ship is turned upside down. They also get stuck sometimes. The gear in the back for the bombs and the wings could've been shorter or less noticeable.

MINIFIGS: They are nice and all look realitively the same. But I wish LEGO would've made them like the real pilots in the movie, or at least made the helmets solid so they have actual faces.

Over all this set is awesome. I mostly named the cons because there are to many pros. I would recomend it to any fan of starwars.  

Peace Out,
          Delka

I got this set in 2005 at LEGO Shop, and was not disappointed with it. Having seen Episode III some two months before and having played the LEGO Star Wars game, I was desperate to get my hands on some heavy clone hardware. Clone Juggernaut? Too expensive! AT-RT? Not expensive enough!</p><p>So, I decided to get the 170. Things to consider: I needed some more clones, a new astromech and, well, more Star Wars vehicles. £30 was pretty good for a set this size.</p><p>I got the set home and got to work. Wow. What a build. The spaceframe was rather easy and fun to make, with parts coloured in all the bright hues of the Grand Army of the Republic- reds, whites, greens... the parts are excellent. The wings are realized in detail, with the huge wing cannons showing some real thought towards design. The rotating tail gun and cockpit details, along with the droid, topped it all off. There were no darn stickers, meaning no annoying sessions spent trying to place them on ridiculously small areas (I hate it when that happens). I love the bomb chute and dispenser idea. It's probably the most interesting yet easily achievable LEGO feature I've seen. The cockpit details are cool, with our trusty gunners sighting up some tri-fighters.<br></p><p>There were <span style=""font-style: italic;"">some</span> flaws... as always, heh! Firstly, my set didn't come with the right parts. I was supposed to have a pair of those rounded, long Technic pieces for attaching the wings to the body, but I was supplied a pair of Technic block pieces with holes and an extra bit of leaflet showing me how to put them on. It didn't feel right, so I managed to secure the proper parts from my Drome Racers Jungle Track and inserted them. Whew. Secondly, the wings are more fragile than most ships. Seriously, more effort could have been invested in making them stronger (maaboo35's Note: They're meant to taper down a little- they slant downwards on the real thing, as well). The cogs on the wings are a little bit of a nuisance as well; if the rod-mounted cog comes out, be careful, as realigning the cog teeth wrongly will result in un-balanced wing positions. Also, the front cockpit is a little featureless- a control panel as seen in the Cato Neimoidia Order 66 bit of Ep. III would work. I will see to implementing that.<br></p><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Great design&nbsp;</li><li>Very good reproduction<br></li><li>Clones</li><li>Droid</li><li>Bomb chute feature is genius<br></li><li>Well worth the money</li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>Some technical problems</li><li>Design needs some refinements</li><li>Got wrong parts- won't happen to everyone, I hope</li></ul>In short, get it if you don't have it. The 2010 model sounds awful, and I'd prefer the more old-school stylings of the 2005 model than shell out £50 - £50!? - for a model with annoying stickers and a lack of effort... though the R4-P44 figure is enticing...

I must say that it is one of the more impressive fightermodels out there and quite large. The colors are simply excellent and it looks as if it packs quite a punch. The swoosh factor is a tad on the downside though; the wings are flimsy and tend to become misaligned after expanding / retracting a few times. Furthermore the expansionmechanism is prone to misalignment between the two wings, rendering it out of balance and a-symmetrical. This then needs to be adjusted by resetting the gearsystem. Compared to the mechanism of the 4502 this one is definitely inferior! <br>This sets contains no stickers whatsoever and all prints are,well, printed on the parts. This is something we see less and less in the contemporary SW sets and that's simply deplorable. This set really shines on that account!<br>
