the minifigs are awesome, despite what others have said.
the construction is tight and secure, and doesn't break easy.
it's well worth the price.
this is a set i recommend to anyone who loves these sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-13T18:32:55Z","the wookies have realy bad technoligy.","The only reson i even looked at this set was first it was an epiosde 3 set and I have to see it and the only reson I realy bought it was for the mini figs ( EXCEPT THE GLOW UP SABERS) and the sweet clone hover thing i hated that wookie cateraman it looked like a canoe witha fan on it.

buy this set if -you want all epiosde 3 sets/or battle of kasyyek
-for the mini figs( besides the glow up sabers)
DONT buy if -you dont like glow up sabers
-if dont want to waste your money and get RIPPED off!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T19:59:37Z","Alright Set","It's funny how people are arguing that the light up sabers are bad, when they are called -light-sabers.

Anyway, the Wookie Boat thing isn't all that good. I guess if you're a Wookie Fan or just like playing with large blunt objects like that, it's good. Personally, I think the Clone Swamp Speeder with the two Green Clones. (Coolest ones) It also comes with Yoda and Luminara Unduli. The Blaster Cannon thing is a good addition on the Wookie Boat, too.

Overall, it's just an average set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2005-05-17T07:46:52Z","Swamp Speeder is best bit ","Forgot to say that I actually thought the swamp speeder was the best part of the set - it certainly goes together better than the catamaran and with the clone minifigs (and no stickers)looks really good. In my view it would have been good if they had released the speeder as a separate cheaper set as if you want it, but not the rest, it is going to be expensive. Again due to not yet been able to do the accuracy to movie check i can only give it a four at the monment.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-29T12:07:23.687Z","Not So Bad","I know that the Wookiee Catamaran appears in Revenge of the Sith, but I am unsure about the Clone Speeder. It looks cool, but did it appear in the movie? I like the other Wookiees Lego made besides Chewbacca. Llumari is also pretty cool with her light up lightsaber. This isn't bad but needs some work to be a 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Leggodt94","2008-02-12T21:40:43.763Z","Finally! Something that chewbaca pilots! (other than the falcon)","This set is one of those types of sets where I like to get it because of the fact that it's based off of an unfamiliar planet(e.g. &gt;sets&lt; The Ultimate Lightsaber Duel). But that's not the only reason. Let's see it shoots a missle, it drops bombs, it comes with rare minifigs, and a cool clone vehicle; but I still don't like the whole light-up lightsabers deal. Also what's up with yoda, no lightsaber, come on! And why go with another chewie? Why not Tarful? He is CLEARLY more suitible for this type of set. Faults aside, I think that this set is good.

"Obi_Wan9994","2008-07-22T10:53:23.797Z","Cool Set!","I got this set for Chrstmas a few years ago, and I thought it was pretty cool(still do). You get 6 mini figs, yoda, chewbacca, Luminara, wookie warrior, and two swamp clones. I thought all of the mini figs were great except Luminara. If Lego hadn't been stupid and given her a light-up lightsaber, she would have been one of my favorite mini figures. Anyway, the Catamaran has room for your mini figs(besides the clones), it has a neat propeller, I love the firing missle, it also looks great on display. You also get a neat little vehicle for your clones. It doesn't do anything, but it's fun to play with, looks nice, and is a great part of this set.
This set is worth the price by far, and it comes with useful pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

the figures 
the small craft
the launching missle

I read a lego magazine and a person who works at lego said that this set took the longest to design out of the episode 3 sets. The swamp speeder is a good bonus and I'allways open to a few extra clones. Also The cannon on the catamaran is awesome and worth at least 100 pieces.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bobbythefish123","2009-10-28T00:47:35.593Z","pretty cool set, not so good value for money.","I bought this set way back in 2005, and just got it rebuilt. I am very pleased with this set, and if you can find it cheap, definitely buy it.

The minifigures for this set are very cool. You get a wookie warrior, which is rare, yoda, rare, a light-up luminara which was exclusive to this set, and a chewbacca Oh and you also get two clone trooper sergeants which have green armor and are new to this. These are definitlely good minifigs.

The next part that i built was the small tank that the clones ride on. It has some rare parts and, while i dont remember seeing it in the movie, makes a nice addition to this set.

The catamaran is pretty straightfoward. It is just two brown hulls held together by two big technic pieces. There is a firing kissile on the center frame, and 4 bombs in the two hulls. when you pull a piece that is held on by a rubber band, it unlocks the bomb chamber and the bombs come tumbling out. It is very cool an gives good play experience. I found that i could fit 5 minifigures in each hull. 

pros-
nice and rare minifigs
cool swamp tank to go with clones
makes good addition to kashyyyk battle scene.
missile is spring loaded which is hard to find nowadays
bombs actually work and are cool
cons-
price is maybe a but high for what you get
build a little on the easy side.

overall, a great set. Buy it!

"phteven","2014-02-25T18:14:52.2Z","Catamaran","<p>I remember getting this set for my 10th birthday when it came out. I loved it instantly. Great parts, fun build, and awesome minifigures (I&#39;ll delve in to those later). And it had 2 vehicles, so playability skyrockets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The catamaran has some pretty standard parts, some in different colours than usual, but I believe most of the pieces for the catamaran I previously had. I do believe; however, that this was the first set of mine to have a spring loaded missile.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The swamp speeder had pretty basic pieces too, but it had a few printed pieces that aren&#39;t available in any other set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Six minifigures in a $50 set. Wow! And one of them is a light up Jedi! The minifigs in this set are really the golden point. Two wookies, Chewbacca and a Wookie warrior. Two Jedi, Yoda and Luminara. And two swamp clones, in phase 2 armour with a green pattern.&nbsp;<br />
I&#39;ll start on the wookies:<br />
?I don&#39;t think there was anything new about the Chewbacca minifig, but the Wookie warrior was a new mold I believe. Not for this set, but for the Episode 3 line of sets. There were 2 or 3 with this Wookie warrior I think. Chewbacca&nbsp;is cool because I could use him in both this set, and in original trilogy sets. The Wookie warrior is just a cool new minifigure. Nothing necessarily special about it, just cool looking.&nbsp;<br />
Now, on to the Jedi:<br />
Two Jedi, Yoda and Luminara. Awesome. Yoda has the standard short legs used for things like kid Boba Fett, and Ewoks (Yoda&#39;s are tan to match his robes). This was about 9 years ago so I don;t remember for sure, but I think Yoda had a green lightsaber. I know he had a brown walking stick, but this is before his battle with Palpatine, so he should have his lightsaber.&nbsp;<br />
Luminara was a light up Jedi with a green lightsaber. At the time, I thought light up Jedi were awesome. Now I&#39;m wishing it hadn&#39;t been. The arm just looks clunky, and the battery is dead now, so it doesn&#39;t even work anymore. Other than the light up bit, she is a cool minifigure, with a sweet new headpiece.&nbsp;<br />
Next, the clones:<br />
Ah, the clones. The guys are probably in my top ten favorite minifigure list. To most, they just see a phase 2 clone with a green pattern. And, for the most part, they are right. And I see that too. But I used them both so much over the years, they just became my favorite. And plus, I&#39;m pretty sure this was the only set they were in, so that makes them all the more rare. They had the standard (for the time) megaphone blaster, with a blue stud on the end, rather than the usual orange or red. Overall, two of my favorite minifigures.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Awesome playability. You can have it take place after order 66, and have the clones and wookies fighting, or you can set it up against some droids and stage a clone/wookie joint battle against some clankers. Either way, great playability in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family:arvo-fs,rockwell,courier,sans-serif; font-size:20px; letter-spacing:-0.75px"">Overall opinion</span></p>

<p>When I was 10, I would have rated it a 9/10, after writing this review, and thinking about everything it had, I would definitely give it a 10/10. If you can find it somewhere for a good price. Buy it. You won&#39;t be dissapointed.&nbsp;</p>

"mememan","2020-07-30T22:40:11.12Z","I LOVE this set","<p>The catamaran looks so cool, with so many good play features. The minifigs are very rare, and i understand why, because they are some of the best minifigures made. The Luminara is my favourite Lego Star Wars figure of all time. It recreates the battle of kashyyyk PERFECTLY.</p>
