"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T23:51:19Z","Pretty cool set ","I thought this set was very cool. It is one of the pricey sets,though what can you expect it says on the box that it has 801 pieces.I only had to pay eighty five dollars for it because I had a ten dollar coupon. I thought that the light up light saber attached to Mace Windo was both cool and dumb. The cool part was that I liked how it looked when it lit up but the bad part was that how it is hard to find a cockpit that he can fit in because that the light saber is stuck onto his hand. Also is how that his head moves around so easily. If you are a big Star Wars or tank fan you should buy this set.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-08T07:16:15Z","Another impressive bug","This is the third similar SW vehicle I have built and its design has benefited from the experience of the other 2. Unlike the AT – TE, (the original impressive bug) the armour plates do not flop about at the slightest touch, and there are no legs to fall off. The shape and construction is similar to the AT – AT with a framework of normal and technic parts used to produce the basic shape with plates attached over the top. The overall construction is good and sturdy with opening sides and panels and hatches. I suggest if the AT – AT is ever re-released (as it should because it is totally superb) the designers consider revising the head assembly along the lines of what has been done here where a similar shape has been produced much more robustly. I like the way the commander’s cupola can be lowered and clicks into place when raised. The other good thing is that not being a walker and having wheels instead, this can actually move unlike the other 2 that have to be posed, so the playability is enhanced.

There are some interesting copper coloured dome bricks here on the inside, and (as seems to be usual and a personal dislike) other odd colours for odd colours sake. Whilst these are fine inside where they can’t be seen, why produce the hinges for the hatches in black and white – as these stick out like a sore thumb against the otherwise grey body. I have already replaced mine with grey equivalents – albeit the old shade of light grey – but they still look better than black and white. It may be when the movie is out they will be black and white, but somehow I doubt it.

The chassis is built first and I found it a little awkward as the beam axles twist about, and don’t really settle down until the very end when the whole thing is finished with the body in place and wheels on. Then the steering suspension mechanism comes into its own, but the front and rear axles can still fall off quite easily – perhaps I will work out a revised method of attachment. There are plenty of minifigs, but I would have liked a couple more – I personally do not have a problem with a light up lightsaber, I think it adds to the playability. The BARC speeder is also very impressive. The nice gun turret operated by the battle droids can be placed inside the main compartment of the tank, but again I somehow doubt this will be the case in the movie. Without been able to carry out my “reality check” with the movie, for now I think it merits a 9 as all other aspects of the set rate a maximum score – again I may increase my rating when I return from the cinema.

"Monty","2005-05-25T11:26:27Z","Post movie review update","My original review was entitled &quot;another impressive bug&quot; but I reserved final judgement until I had seen the movie. Well I saw it yesterday. I enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with the all too brief glimpses of most of the &quot;machines&quot;, particularly the clone turbo tank. However,from what I saw this set now rates a maximum score, as it is very accurate BARC speeder included.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MattJek82","2006-07-15T13:06:19Z","Very Impressed!!","I went out on a whim and bought this set a few days ago. It was the biggest and most expensive LEGO set I’ve ever bought. Luckily, I was able to find the 2006 version of this set with a regular Mace Windu (instead of a light-up one) and one extra clone trooper for a total of 8 Minifigs! It took me almost 3 hours to put this beast together but in the end I was very impressed. 
I think the turning mechanism is very well designed, as you push the tank, you lean it away from the direction that you want to turn in. The outside of the tank is well designed as well; the plates fit together nicely and for the most part give the tank a solid and heavily armored look. The tank is also nicely detailed on the outside, with many guns, turrets and cannons. The accessories such as the big gun turret and the speeder also add to the playability and value of the set.
My only gripes with this set are that only one set of wheels has a spring suspension. However, this single suspension seems to do the job and the tank runs great over flat surfaces and conquers small to medium terrain obstacles with ease. Also, I’d like to see a little more detail in the cockpit area of the tank. There is room for two pilots but there are not control parts such as bricks with computer screens or levers.
Overall, this is an awesome set. The 2006 revision with a regular Mace Windu and an extra clone trooper makes it just that much better. I shelled out a pretty penny for this bad boy but it was all worth it.

"mars4life","2008-06-08T15:58:54.263Z","Turbo Tank","This set is a little disapointing. The first time I got it a gift, I returned it for the Imperial Star Destroyer, which was a much better buy and I would recommend that instead of this set. But, my brother, who is a clone fanatic, received it as a present some years later, and as he was incapable of building it at that time due to his age, I ended up building, and in the long run playing with it, for him. The building of this set isn't very great. It pretty much consists of the suspension system, a frame for the armor, and putting the armor on, which is nothing more than placing panels on the frame in any way you can. This was the worst part of this set. Because the armor is just panels, it is incredibly thin, which could prove disastrous if it was faced with a more powerful enemy such as the MTT, which has much thicker armor and bigger guns. Also, I can never tell which end is the front or the back. On the thicker end there are clear yellow cones that might be bombs or rockets, but look more like lights to me. These can be knocked off very easily. Also, the gun on top is the same.<br /><br />The people for this set were pretty good. The best is the green clone who looks like the scout troopers in episode six. He is very detailed and has decals on his legs, not something Lego does too much any more. The rest of the clones are okay, but all the clones on Kashyyyk were the green ones, there were no normal ones. This is fine, Lego most likely did it because the Kashyyyk troopers are expensive to produce. The jet pack falls off all the time, and it looks kinda weird. The commander clone is good because he has the cloth on his shoulder, something Lego didn't bother to do in the clone expansion sets. The worst minifig in this set in my opinion was Mace Windu, because of the light up lightsaber feature. Due to this feature, he can't move his hand so he can do cool moves, and you can't take him apart. Also his head is very loose, and slides around, which usually ends up with him looking backwards.(And he's not even supposed to be in Kashyyyk)There could have been more droids, they didn't really pose a threat against a tank.<br /><br />The suspension system works great, But I think Lego spent too much time working on it, time which would have been better spent on other things.<br /><br />",FALSE,4,3,3,5,4

Another bad thing is that the guy in the periscope falls out easily whenever you start to move the tank. As the title says, this tank was too technic because the walls and the roof of the main room are held on only by technic pieces. Also, it's hard to fit people inside the main room because of the yellow wavy 1x2 bricks that hold the droid's turret. I also thought that it was strange to put the DROID'S turret in the CLONE'S vehicle.

Build: 8/10. It took like 12 Hours to build WITH my brothers help. Saying that it's really fun when you build together, so I suppose the build was pretty good. Maybe they could of cut out some technic bits though and just made it a bit more simple to understand on the instructions.

Playability: 7/10. It's not the best for playing with to be honest, it's more for set-ups and show really. I mean, the functions make it easy to play with for the most of the time, but without them it would only get about a 6/10.

Functions: 10/10. The functions are by far the best part about it!

Secondly, the two doors can open to reveal a removable Anti-Air turret and space for troopers! Also, there's a cool engine and a couple of places to put clones in.

"Phoenixfighter","2009-05-09T16:51:51.81Z","7261 Clone Turbo Tank","This set is outstanding. Complete with a speeder bike, turret and jet trooper this set is a must have for all StarWars collectors.

Cock pit (front). I'm still not quite sure which end is the front, in the picture above it shows the front is the big part which is part of the cargo bay (?) but in the instructions it says that the turbo tank can be driven both ways. The front cock pit is pretty cool, I like the fact that you sit the driver down on the platform, open the hatch and push his head through the top so he can see ( an easy target for snipers ).

Cargo hold. This is probably the main part of this set. Lots of room for troops and a scout tower. The annoying thing is that the turret takes up most of the room. So I took it out. I really like the scout tower, it's so smooth to lift and it locks into place so easily. I would prefer it to have no flat bottom on the inside so that troops could sit down without falling out.

Engine. The engine looks really cool. It is also the same type of engine as the one in the Wookie Catamaran.

Cock pit (rear). This part of the set isn't very interesting but the turret on top helps it out. The cock pit itself is all right, it fits two clones and has two blasters next to the chairs. Pretty boring. The turret is pretty good,  excellent for rear/front defense. 

Wheels. I feel pretty stupid saying this but, The wheels are quite amazing. The suspension and the way the tank turns when you lean it over. The amount of wheels is good for off road use, not that this set is going on sand.

Well there you have it folks, if you are unsure about buying this set or turned down an offer for it, this set is an excellent buy! You aren't a StarWars collector without it.

It has an amazing engine room at  the end of the ship. A lot of movable cannons. Includes a BARC speeder and two battle droids who do not have the fire arm. I got this lego for christmas a couple years ago. It also has a lookout stand for one minifig. Another neat thing is a small white turret for the droids and a blaster stand. 

Pros: lot of rare pieces and minifigs including the Kashyyyk trooper, tons of space, tons of turrets with two cockpits, and a nice jetpack design.

Cons: wheels don't stay on so well, bad Mace Windu minfig,",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego_here","2009-09-14T14:03:53.56Z","The pride of my collection","This was first in my favourite sets until I got the repbulic gunship ,now they both sit at the top of my favorites.

Now let me start off that there was 2 versions realese:
version 1-came out in 2005,with light up mace windu
version 2(which I have)-came out in 2006 with no lights and you get a extra clone

I bought this set in 2006 on ebay for 80-90 pounds(inc postage+packaging).Now with that out of the way lets go onto the review.

pros
exclusive mace windu,kashyyk clone,aerial trooper  
8 minifigures
suspension on the clone wheels
barc speeder(which is my favourite speeder)
loads of guns/turrets
droid cannon+turret
engine detail
space to go inside
no stickers

cons
figures all mixed up ,I mean commander cody was always with obi wan,the aerial trooper and mace windu were never at the battle of kashyyk.The speeder was not used in the battle of kashyyk.
I find it strange that lego put the droids turret inside the tank
can break if you bang it against a wall 
the little guns break off easy ,i've had to buy new pieces to replace the lost one
inside the tank where you open the door the technic peices seem to have broken so I have had improvise with that.

If you didn't get this set then you missed a very good thing though I hear they are realsing a new clone turbo tank in 2010 so make sure you get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StarWarsLEGOlover","2010-02-14T01:38:32.153Z","Great Buy","I got this set 5 years ago. Even though it was only in Revenge of The Sith for about 3 seconds it's still awesome. 

The overall design of the vehicle is astounding, nothing falls off, the bricks at the bottom that form the structure are surprisingly strong and interlocked with each other, I've only had to rebuild this set twice which is very good considering it's been through a move of house and been stored in a crate with other lego for a few months all in five years! 

There's heaps of little features that you wouldn't notice just looking at the picture. like the openable hatches either side of the engine, the adjustable look out tower, the suspension of the 10 wheels, and the ability to open up the sides to hold all your clones, you can sort of see it in the picture but there's a small hatch just above the pilot seat where you can move the seat up open the hatch and have his head sticking out, how cool is that?

The mini figures in this set are great. You've got a jet trooper, a scout trooper + speeder, a normal clone and not to mention Mace Windu! To be honest with you, I hate light up lightsabers with a passion, I don't get the what made them think of that, all they do is crush the imagination of the small children playing with it the can't move the hand you can't take the lightsaber out of his hand the head doesn't come off the legs don't come off what the hell is the point of it? Sorry got a bit carried away there.
Anyway the droids and turret are also a nice touch to add to the feeling that they're in a battle. 

But the overall thing i love about this set is the fact there's so much room to move with it you could literally have about 10 - 15 clones on the inside and at least half a dozen more on the top, in fact I've recently fitted out the main inside area with chairs for my army.
It's not only a fighting heavily armed tank it's also a perfect way to transport your clone army battlefield to battlefield.

In conclusion you can't go wrong with this set whether you want it for a transport for your troops or some extra fire power for your clone army it will serve you well. There's also bonus features you won't find until you've built it like the many moveable hatches and the adjustable scout tower. One thing I really hate is Mace Windu and his light up light saber, I know I've al ready had a rant but it just sickens me that they thought about it and then did it, but at least they stopped, and i bought a mace without a light up lightsaber anyway. but what really makes me sad is the fact that lego are releasing a new clone turbo tank in 2010, I've had a look at the pictures and it's not nearly as presentable as this one. In the end if you don't have turbo tank get this one not the new one, this one is much better.

PROS: +
Has 4 clones :)
massive wheels
Suspension
Hidden Features eg hatches 
plenty of space
many uses

CONS: -
Mace Windu's lightsaber 
lego are releasing a new one and making a great set obsolete ",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
"Skyboss","2010-05-18T17:19:11.467Z","this was my set that started it all","<p>this was my first set as the title says. it took me three whole days (i was young). it is supprisingly rugged. it survived a trip to my grandmothers house, all my friends playing with it and several accidental drops on the floor (not my fualt). </p>
<p>the set has a multitude of features. the massive hatches on the sides open, the look out tower rises/turns and you can put Tons of clones in&nbsp;there! </p>
<p>the tanks suspentoin is great! i test it all the time and the thing holds up to it all. the tank has a wide turning radius and is somewhat heavy. its mostly a technic build from the wheels to the large hatch. every thing else is regular lego build. </p>
<p>- pros,</p>
<p>rugged, reliable and tons of room inside</p>
<p>- cons</p>
<p>heavy to young people, long build, and its Big!</p>

"CommanderJett8445","2011-01-26T21:04:44.94Z","fantastic","After two and a half hours of making this set, it turned out very sturdy and realistic.....Until I was walking downstairs and I was so excited that my hands got sweaty and I dropped it and it crashed and pieces went flying! I still blame myself, my sweat and the way I put it together because if you don't pack down the pieces they come loose and break off (don't glue them together because it makes it worse!). Overall, it is a very good set.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"RCT3Dude96","2011-02-24T00:01:05.71Z","What's not to love?","Ever since I laid my eyes on this set, I wanted it. Although I would try to get it on Ebay ( because my local toy store never had it) no luck. It wasn't until Christmas until I received it. Anyways, this set is incredible. So many unique features and figures. Mace Windu, the speeder bike clone, as well as the clone with the jet pack. The build took a while because this set is surprisingly technic, though hidden under all that armor. Although it has many, this set has very few unique pieces, which was kind of dissapointing. Once the whole thing was built, the playability became apparent. Hours of fun awaits anyone who buys this set! And an awesome value with a lot of wheels and big plates and minifigures for only 90$. Overall a success, and in my opinion, much more attractive than the Clone Wars version.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"LEGOSweden","2011-04-18T21:51:40.58Z","The best Lego set I have","<span class=""rkr""><br>
This set has just over 800 pieces. A good assortment of Technic and 
regular parts to work with. Colors are mostly gray and dark gray, with a
 bit of dark red. A little brown 
and yellow here and there, but nothing too annoying. 
<br>

<br>
As mentioned, this set comes with a good number of accessories for your 
tank. A cannon with rotating turret. A small cannon for a battle droid 
to operate. A jetpack with wings for the aerial trooper. And a nice 
speeder bike. 
<br>

<br>
Aside from the small gripes I've already mentioned, I have a few 
additional ones. Mace Windu's battery isn't replaceable. I'm not sure 
what we're supposed to do when his battery runs dry. The light-up light 
saber is held in his right hand, which isn't movable. You can move his 
arm up and down, but you can't pose the hand. The light saber is held at
 an angle. But these are very minor complaints. I suppose that's the 
price we pay for a light-up light saber. I should mention that Mace's 
light saber is tinted purple, but the light is blue. Maybe it's just the
 lighting in my home, but his saber comes off looking more blue than 
purple when lit up. 
<br>

<br>
I believe the faults mentioned here are all pretty minor. This set gets a
 big thumbs up from me. I had a great time assembling it and playing 
around with it.&nbsp;</span>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2020-01-23T04:22:24.86Z","My Second Clone Turbo Tank","<p>So I already owned <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8098-1/Clone-Turbo-Tank"">8098</a> when I managed to get this set for free! So given that both sets are over a decade old, I will compare the two in this review for anyone looking to pick up a Clone Turbo Tank.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So clearly the highlight of this set is also its biggest disappointment, and that is the light up Mace Windu. There is no doubt&nbsp;it is a cool idea, and Mace for whatever reason appears in very few sets. However, the problem is that at this point in time he isn&#39;t going to work. Now I&#39;ve seen there are videos about how to change the batteries, but I haven&#39;t watched them yet and don&#39;t really want to risk breaking the minifigure. Beyond Mace, you don&#39;t get anything too exciting, 3 clones and 2 battle droids. Yes the clones are all different (that sounds really wrong) and the one with the jet pack is cool, but you probably already own enough clone minifigures to represent the entire 501st. I much prefer the minifigure selection in the&nbsp;2010 set which is based on The Clone&nbsp;Wars series&nbsp;and contains 3 very&nbsp;hard to get minifigures (Asoka, Aayla Secura, and Cad Bane) along with Anakin and a couple clones.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>

<p>So this set comes with 2 extras. A very cool looking speeder bike, and a turret tower that looks like it came from Hoth. The tower does fit into the cargo&nbsp;bay, but&nbsp;the speeder bike doesn&#39;t. The 2010 set came with a walker (very appropriate for The Clone Wars) and some sort of command module, both of which fit into the cargo bay. I really have to give the advantage to the later simply because everything can be stored inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The Design&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The two sets are rather similar. It is pretty clear that 8098 is basically a more refined version of this set. Basically, 8098 addresses all the design issues that appear in this set.</p>

<p>This set is very fragile and the only way to transport it is by carrying it from underneath. 8098 solves this problem in two ways. First it fixes the fragility and has a very strong structure. Second it has a retractable handle on top for carrying it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both sets allow you to turn the tank while driving it by tilting it. However this set is very counterintuitive, when you tilt it to the left it turns to the right, and vice versa. Really everything about this design from the function to the look is awkward. 8098 solved this by having the tank turn in the direction of the tilt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the last main difference is accessibility of the interior. This set makes it very hard to get into the interior, not to mention the interior is much more cramped. The reason for this is that the outside panels for the most part have a very limited range of motion. 8098 allows for a much larger range of motion so that you have easy access to the much roomier interior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set does however have one feature that 8098 does not, the crows nest. While I like that it has this feature, the feature does have a drawback in that it can&#39;t move up and down so the set needs to be stored in a much larger space vertically.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the two sets are very similar. The wheels are attached in a very similar fashion. The detailing on the outer panels are almost identical. And I think it is the same exact size (very large).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a good set, and a fantastic feat of Lego engineering in its time. But what a difference 5 years made in Lego engineering. 8098 is just a much better built set, and that alone makes me recommend it. The minifigure&nbsp;selection is what seals the deal. But this is a very good set, especially for its time.&nbsp;</p>
