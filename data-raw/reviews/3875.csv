I'm not much of a LEGO Star Wars Fan myself (more of a fan of the classic Town sets), but I wanted to try out the new light up lightsabers of the figures. I bought it from LEGO Shop @ Home. As I found out, the box says that the battery is not replaceable, but as a matter of fact, the battery IS replaceable, although it WILL CAUSE SCRATCHES to your mini-figure.  :-(   This has been confirmed because:
  1st, I did it myself and it worked... =)  and 
  2nd, If you search the web a little you'll find that I'm right, and I found this nifty site:

http://repoort.proboards43.com/index.cgi?board=Lego&amp;num=1105222682&amp;action=display&amp;start=30

(You can read the rest of the thread if you want for more information on replacing it.) Yes, Yes, Yes... The pictures show the police light-up fig...but the Darth Vader is put together exactly in the same way. One very strange thing though (and a setback if you put it at that), the wrist can not turn like a normal minifig's. (You know where I'm getting to...you'll be sliced before you can even know what's happening!) But definately a 9/10 if you are a Star Wars fan. It's has all the pleasures of an old classic with a new light-up fig. The actual set is very nice and has &quot;classic&quot; elements, along with high play value and functions, this set is worth every penny. The interior could be a little improved and be a little more detailed, but the good overpowers the good...by far. And the new figs might become popular in the future, so you might have a chance of pulling some extra money for this set on E-bay, but not just yet...maybe in three years? Well... go for it, especially if you are a fan of LEGO or Star Wars, or both.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Hehehehehe, anyways, this set is a classic model that's hard to resist and impossible not to get! It comes with a classic tie pilot minifigure and Darth Vader light-up lightsaber minigure. Now, I disaprove light-up characters completely, but strangely I like the light-up darth vader. Now, I would defintely prefer a stormtrooper, but I'm satisfied with Vader. Now, the model includes features like an openning cockpit and adjustable controls. Now, usually at this point in a tie fighter review I'll say something like &quot;Your tie collection will not be complete without this set.&quot; Well, that's true because the classic tie fighter is your tie collection, so without this set you have no tie collection. Anyways, you should definitely get this set if you missed the first one like me, and even if you didn't you should still get this set! TIE FIGHTERS RULE! :D ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Vader and a TIE fighter pilot.  His head is brown, NOT black.  The set is designed 
nice and the cockpit is a little tight and it can't fit both minifigures in the 
cockpit.  :(  That is O.K. because maybe Darth Vader is waiting for the TIE fighter 
pilot to come back, or whatever you can imagine.  It looks nice and it has NO 
stickers, I repeat NO stickers!! Whoohoo!! :D  Sorry for the outburst...now back to
the set, it is pretty tall and the colors look REALLY cool!  It is movie accurate 
and you see A TON of these in the classic Star Wars movies!  There is nothing else
to say about it except that you should 100% get and I really hope you enjoyed the review!

"Obi_Wan9994","2008-06-16T16:49:49.437Z","We're Under Attack!","This was one of my first sets, and it wasn't too bad. It has an opening cockpit that can fit one mini fig. It comes with a light-up lightsaber Darth Vader, and a tie pilot(brown head). I'm not a fan of light up lightsaber figures, because you can't customize them, and they have limited movement, but if you're a fan of them thats fine,  and you might like Vader. This set has lots of nice pieces, and the black and blue coloring is neat and detailed. It's also pretty sturdy. Personally, I didn't think it was real fun to play with, but lots of other people think differently, and that's fine.
I'm not a fan of putting stickers on legos, and I'm happy to say this set doesn't include them(If you like stickers, I'm sorry). This isn't a really quick build, but it's fun. This set goes really well with lots of other Star Wars sets. For it's price, I guess it's worth it.

Not really any

Fragile!
Easy to break!
Fragile like Mega Blocks

This set is bad, but even Mega Blocks is worse.

Why did lego slightly alter the cackpit so that Darth Vader can sit in it even though Darth vader pilots a Tie Advance. It isn't so much a con but it does bug me a lot. I like the addition of Darth Vader and the light up lightsabers aren't that bad but read the title and feel fre to comment on it. As i said in the Interceptor review the wobbling still doesn't bug me. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Good:
Darth Vader w/Light-up Red Lightsaber (where he is, I don't know)
Shadow Trooper TIE Pilot
Simple [to build]
Great for Space Battles

Bad:
Wobbly wings
Loose Cockpit

The cramped cockpit is not un-realistic, so I won't make it a bad.

Cheap, fragile and ever so quick, these qualities (I do this comparative thing a lot, so hold on) are reflected in the model. <br><p>Overall, it's superb. Wonderfully realized with flair, the TIE is piloted by a grunt helmsman, one of a select number brave, skilled or foolhardy enough to take up the yoke of such a treacherous craft. The parts do slot together well, even though the blue doesn't look right somehow. Moving on... <br></p><p>There are, however, flaws. I think LEGO overdid the fragile thing a bit. Clip an object (tabletop, sofa, shelf) at even a slow pace and the wings go spinning off across the room. Yes, even a glancing hit can destroy a TIE fighter, but LEGO should really reinforce the wings better. The hatch also opens with the viewport. This is a little simplified, and should be relegated to the hatch, and not the near entirety of the ship's hull.</p><p>I'm not sure whether the Darth Vader LUL (light-up-lightsaber) figure is a pro or con, having the coolness yet the inherent drawbacks of the LUL premise.

For a while, this was the only kind and these fighters would be seen in swarms fighting for the empire. With minimal of anything (no shields, hyperdrive or life support) this one man fighter would be decimated by its rebel counterpart the x-wing one on one. But the Empire did one thing, change the odds to 50 or even 100 to one. Anyway, enough history class and onto the review!</p><div>I built this a long time ago but: the build was ok. It didn't take to long to build. It helped me set up for others like the TIE collection, interceptor and defender. You start bu building the command pod, then build the wings.</div><p>Parts: Lego did not introduce any new parts. The pod's wind screen/window is not to hard to find now although it is an interesting piece. The minifigures are ok, but you can skip them or this set if you want to. You see Vader in Tons of other sets( tie collection, star destroyer and others) but this is the only light up version.

"Chills","2012-08-20T19:21:56.133Z","The original TIE: and a pretty cool set","<p>As I've mentioned in other reviews, due to a recent move I've had the opportunity to rebuild the majority of my LEGO collection, and review the sets. This version of the TIE Fighter was pretty cool back when it came out, and even though it now looks dated I still like the way it is designed.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The quick, agile, but fragile ship is the backbone of the Imperial Navy. This set brings you back to those fighters from the movie. The designer got creative using different pieces to show detail.<br></li><li>Pro 2: I still like the use of blue on the old TIE series of ships. This fighter definitely belongs with that era.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was pretty straight forward, and enjoyable. There aren't any cool new pieces, but the classic TIE cockpit window.</li><li>Pro 4: I had to give a shout out to the Darth Vader with light-up saber. I have a ton of Vader minifigures, but this one is pretty sweet.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Like all the TIEs of this generation it is fragile. The wings aren't held on very well. I guess that could be a good thing so you can simulate ""battle damage."" In the movies those wings flew off pretty easily. LOL<br></li><li>Con 2: I'm not digging the cockpit control panel. Its a small detail, but I would have liked to see something a little more detailed.<br></li></ul>
<p>I do not own the new TIE Fighter, yet, so this one is the mainstay of my TIE collection. Its a fun set to build, has some cool minifigures, and looks great with the rest of the blue/black TIEs. I'm sure the new one has more of a cool-factor, but I really like the nostalgic LEGO look to this one.<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3

<p><strong>Minifigures&nbsp;(10/10)</strong></p>

<p>You have to give it a ten, when it has Vader. Yes, the rare Light Up Darth Vader is here in this set. It is something special to have. Although you can&#39;t take it apart, this is something great to have in a collection. On the other hand it has the classic 2003 tie fighter pilot. Nothing to new there.</p>

<p><strong>The Tie Itself (8/10)</strong></p>

<p>Aright the tie is great. All it really is the classic Tie Fighter with a tiny piece difference. So a point off for a recycled build. Another con of it was the fact it was a normal tie. It could&#39;ve been a Tie Advanced, it&#39;ll fit Vader more. Other than that it is okay1</p>
