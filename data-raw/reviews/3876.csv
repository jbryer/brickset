This ""Captain Kragg"" somthin or other is a nice toy. Way better than any toy they give out here in the US. Captain Kragg is  O.K., but the barrel and spider were better. I'd be happy to get it again, so long as I didn't have to eat that chicken again. >:( ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-25T17:26:19.06Z","Got this at LEGOLAND Windsor, not Deutschland!","This is a nice little set, with a barrel, bat, big leaf, and Captain Kragg!

Pros:

Barrel
Bat
Big leaf
Kragg

Cons:

None!

Overall, a good set! BTW, I like Kragg, since it doesn't look ugly like Jack Stone!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
