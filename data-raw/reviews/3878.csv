Sure, it would probably get them where they need to go, but it sure doesn't impress me very much. Larger martian crafts are much more creative. However, i like the back of the craft, with the alien techonalgy.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T16:04:11.48Z","What does the Double stand for?","<p>Set #7300 Double Hover: LEGO Life on Mars, truly an interesting Sub-Theme if only because the Martians gave us funky colored Battle Droid body pieces and nifty new heads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Double Hover was a small set, cheap and part of a four group set that included the model, the Mini-Figure, the instructions and one part of a four part poster featuring all of the Life on Mars Mini-Figures and their names. I chose to donate my entire Life on Mars Sub-Theme sets to a charity store when I was trying to make more room in my storage area for all my sets and weeding out the ones I could do without.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Double Hover isn't a bad set, it just isn't a great set either. On a scale of one to&nbsp;five I'd rate it a four gaining points for being cheap, including a unique Mini-Figure and the nifty little poster. The model is simple and easy to build, takes no time at all really, but unless you have all four of these small impulse sets you won't get much fun out of them. They are an excellent source for MOC parts though. I once combined all three Alien ships into one massive ship and it looked great. But as I said, I personally can do without them, even if I was to resume interest in the Life on Mars sets I'd probably stick to just picking up the larger mechs and stuff. But that is my opinion, yours could be different, I try not to pass too harsh a judgement on my LEGO sets (even the ones I gave away.) because in all honesty LEGO is about having fun and building new and exciting things. Just because my tastes for these sets changed doesn't mean yours will. If you know someone who has one take a look at it in person before making up your mind on if you want this set or not.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
