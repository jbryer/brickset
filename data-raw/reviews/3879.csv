Have a few sets of Life On Mars and this was a cheap one to add to the bunch. O K set I do have two of these in my collection as one was given to me as a gag gift by a old High School buddy.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T16:11:12.043Z","Explore, Explore, Explore","<p>Set #7301 Rover: This little set might be considered an embarrassment by some, but it is still a cheap way to get a Mini-Figure. Well it was at retail, I'm not sure of how in-demand this little thing is nowadays, but I can't imagine much since it was an impulse set and tended to litter store shelves for several months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rover is the only little set amongst the four that includes a LEGO astronaut rather than a Martian and I feel that may be where this set suffers. The model is much too simplistic and lacks proper looking wheels. This little set should have been included with a much larger vessel, then it would have been better as the small one-man land unit that is used to dig up samples from Mars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want this set and have a chance to get it go for it, but if you're only passingly interested in it I'd say try to get it with the other three sets 7300 - 7303 because on its own this set just isn't worth much. I kind of like it though still&nbsp;a little bit, maybe because he's the underdog of the group. Daring to be different.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,5
