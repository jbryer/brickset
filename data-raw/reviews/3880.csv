"Ovid07","2007-07-11T07:33:08.53Z","OK Set ","This is a good set for the LOM lineup however it could be a bit better.  It comes with a cool martin, control panel and the worker robot its self.  The colors are bit of mish-mash (or at least I think so), and the legs aren't really movable.  Over all this is a pretty good set to add to your LOM collection, but nowadays it is hard to get a hold of, and not really worth it.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-13T23:39:12.28Z","Mini-Mech","I believe I bought this set so i had on of the Aliens as a kid. Glad I did too. The model itself is kind of basic, with a half a cockpit, Connected to some feet buy the new hinges. Also has a control panel held up on the same piece as the aliens arm, in the same colour. The bit that annoys me the most with this model is the way the legs move. They hinge side to side not back and forward. So due to this the model walks like a crab.

The alien itself is pretty straight forward. Legs are one piece, arms and head move up and down. One bit that annoys me with this model is that the aliens cant stay in a seat as they dont click in. They must stand or hold on to something. The other thing that is annoying with this model is the colours. The model is ok and the alien is ok but together they look horrendous. Also as I mentioned above with the green arm just cheap.

Overall it is a nice model to display and good to play with if you have a huge imagination but on the aesthetics side this one was a bit of a let down. Still a good addition to any space set without a Life on Mars model as they bring something else to the collection. 5/10 from me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-03T20:16:25.7Z","Actually pretty bad","This set has a pretty ugly design which looks nothing like the much more impressive sets like the 194 piece ones. It has a pretty ugly color scheme and is overall lame. The only thing that keeps this set from getting a one is the incredible and clever martian which comes with it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T21:20:31.32Z","Worker Robot? Where's the Arms?","<p>Set #7302 Worker Robot: The group of four as Impulse sets work, but not as well as they could have. 7300 - 7303 were all impulse sets from Life on Mars, small little vehicles with a single Mini-Figure that were unfortunately lacking in certain respects. Individually the vehicles don't look like much, but if you took all the pieces from them and merged them into your own unique model you could actually come up with something fun and decent looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Worker Robot seems to be lacking in only one crucial element, manipulator arms to actually do the work the Martian pilot wants it to. If it had been called Explorer Robot it might have made a little more sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All four of them together are perfect and should have been one set, it would have been a better value for your dollar than the single impulse set formula, and then maybe they could have included a few extra pieces to make them much better models. I don't think they are bad, but they need some work and that's why I say if you want pieces to MOC something then these are a good starter for that sort of thing. But these sets are not absolutely necessary to have a complete Life on Mars collection.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
