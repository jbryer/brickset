The Jet Scooter succeeds in looking like a great model, it is an open air vessel used by the Martians to travel across their home planet... Or at least that's how I saw it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This build is decent enough, this is the set to get for the bulk of the MOCing needs when combining 7300 - 7303. Mainly because I think it has the most pieces. As a stand alone model it's also nicer than some of the others from the Impulse range, as I may have mentioned before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Martian Mini-Figures are actually kind of interesting. Take the Battle Droid torso, arms and legs, hit them with a rainbow blaster of some kind and stick on a new round looking alien head and you've got a Martian. It's a nice use of LEGO Star Wars pieces in a different theme for Mini-Figures. I think everyone's Space collection could use a few Life on Mars Mini-Figures, they are definitely better than the Mars Missions Alien Mini-Figures. At least these ones can move their limbs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you're looking to get one of the impulse sets I'd say this one is your best bet. I recommend this one, but keep in mind that this set is still an impulse set and uses a limited number of pieces to make the model. So prepare to do a little bit of MOCing with it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
