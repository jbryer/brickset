Did not get alot of the L O Mars sets but I do really like this one because of the Martian. The vehicle itself is pretty neat, it can be adjusted more than one might think. If you are into Space sets this one will satisfy most any LEGO fan. Would recommend it to those into Space or Life on Mars theme.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The hovercraft is pretty cool and fun to play with. It looks a little like a pod racer but much smaller and lamer. This isn't bad though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"FloridaEggplant","2011-01-27T07:55:16.947Z","Reminds me of Zam Wessel's speeder","I got this set in a value pack. I like this set, but its not much of a building experience, you could build this in 2 or 1 minute(s). I am not gonna put a Pros/Cons list because this set does not have much parts. I like the disk on the back of the vehicle. This vehicle looks like Zam Wessel's speeder. I like how they used green and orange, besides, grey is sort of overused for vehicles. This set is quite playable, not the best playability. I like the minifig, and its colors, but its hard to stand up. Overall, this set is slightly good for playability.",FALSE,4,3,2,3,5
