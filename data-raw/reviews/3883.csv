 I'd give it a five, but the wheels weren't given much thought and are a disaster. I love the astronaut/scientist 
 mini-fig because the torso looks awesome. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

So I decided to review one Life on Mars set for the occasion. Onto the review, I really like this set. The wheels are very unique and I like the driver. I dislike the so-called joustling stick. Besides that, it is a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The wheels are strange but I guess the should be - who know the traction you would get on the surface of mars.  Like the mini fiqure - not a bad set - not a great set, good addition if you have a collection going with Life on Mars theme.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It, like most of the other sets, actaully looks ready to go explore mars! The minifigures are incredible in this theme, this one is no exception. And the satelaite is neat.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
