"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-17T07:21:10Z","O.K","This set is okay but it needs to be blanced and it should have a windsheild or something like that to cover the cockpit. 
Pluses:
* Small set
* Minifig

Minus:
* To off-balanced
* lack of detail in which a real mars explorer would have

Overall it is small and simple but not great to play with on its own, it needs other life on mars sets to go with it. The balance should be better as well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-11-30T13:00:19.7Z","Good parts pack","For a five dollar set this thing packs alot of great parts. The astronaut is nice and has a chromed visor, his torso is also very usefull for a modern pilot. 

There is a unique one wheeled ground vehicle which in my opinion looks good for such a small set. Even though it has no cockpit current Mars rover designs seem to be like that so I can't see any faults with it. This set is a good space parts pack as it has a &quot;space wheel&quot; and engine along with some nice printed tiles.

I would recomend it if you are a space fan looking for some partsor anybody looking for a ood cheap set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-08-20T01:06:10.543Z","Perfect for an impulse set","I love this set- the interesting design couples with the very buyable price and great minifig makes for one of the best impulse sets of all time.

PROS:

- Simple build.

- Interesting design.

- Cool fig. 

- Useful parts. 

- Cheap.

CONS:

- Isn't very balanced- leans to the side the astronaut sits in. 

- You really need to buy two before you can build anything with them. 


Certainly worth buying IMO, and one of my favorite impulse sets ever. Must have! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-04T15:05:25.577Z","Mono Jet","One of the small sets in the Life on Mars theme, the Mono Jet have a good color scheme and useful pieces. The minifigure included is an astronaut that is simple but still also nicely designed. The minifigure have too some details and a helmet in a good shape. The jet is made with a big wheel as the base. The wheel is a good piece that connects the side of the jet, nicely builted, and the side that the pilot stays, basically builted above a long small plate and with no much pieces increasing it. The pilot stays in it very well, altough it don't have a cockpit very well, are basically some small white plates covering the pilot. The jet still a good small set, but the wheel cannot makes it still in feet. Altough the set have some problems with the building, this small have so much useful pieces with great color scheme and is consideable to increase other space sets, like trikes or too spaceships. The playability can be better only on the wheel, but the set still good and better if you increase it or other with this. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"penguin3332","2008-07-27T16:01:09.623Z","Mono Jet","This was one of the first Lego sets that I had.  It is small but has wonderful pieces.

Great things-

-Nice huge gray wheel
-Lots of control panels (They are great for decorating space objects)
-Cool light blue slope
-Nice rocket-engine piece
-Really nice figure with chrome visor and cool details

Dislikes-

-I never could figure out how to make it not tip while in motion

Overall, this is a good set with just one large mistake.  It is great for space parts, or just a small fun set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2011-01-12T01:17:37.93Z","Mono... uugh.....","<p>My only defense for having picked up this set is that it was small and therefore, an impluse buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really do not like this set or it's theme. I appreciated on LEGO's part a return to the space them, I just didn't like the Life on Mars series. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every now and then I sift through my pile of Lego instructions and I come across the Life on Mars instructions and I look at the pictures, I just get this mental twinge and shudder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fail to see how this set can be a jet with a huge wheel on it. The minifigure and the final build for this set just don't do anything for me. So it probably won't be long before I find and rebuild this set only so I can sell it off on e-bay or similar site.</p>",TRUE,1,3,2,1,1
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T21:39:22.25Z","Mono Jet???","<p>Set #7310 Mono Jet: Whoever was naming these LEGO Life on Mars sets must have been slapping random words together. I don't mean to be disrespectful or something because there are a lot of LEGO sets to recieve names over the year, but Mono Jet... Mono Singular, Jet, Something That Flies. So why does this model have a ginormous wheel strapped to it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I've gotten that out of the way allow me to discuss the model itself. As small sets go Mono Jet isn't bad, in fact this set is a decent little single manned vessel for the astronauts exploring Mars. It looks like something you'd see zooming around an alien world, and yet still built by people on Earth. The pilot rides on the side and apparently this vehicle can either run on land or zip through the skies using the engine on the other side of the wheel. (Oh, maybe that's why it has a wheel that large, to protect the pilot from the exhaust flames of the engine.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is basic LEGO Astronaut flair, but he comes with a shiny chromed face mask, he must have borrowed it from Lord Ogel Alpha Team's enemy. He's a worthy astronaut to add to your Space based sets though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that this is a good set and something fun, with a good bit of potential for MOCers. In theory if you had two of them and built them as mirror opposites of each other you could probably connect them together and have a two wheeled flying craft and two Mini-Figures. Hmmmm... That actually sounds like it might look good.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
