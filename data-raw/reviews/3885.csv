When I got my first one, I thought it was an akward little model, but then when I got my second, it made me realize this is one sweet thing for only seven bucks! I used two as an escort for the amazing Recon Mech RP. For the other one, I added a second leg and modified the cockpit. It's a darn shame LEGO stopped the LoM theme, I was really begining to like these!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-17T07:27:37Z","GREAT","I agree with Crustacean Freak on the fact that lego should have not stopped making Life on Mars sets. i like this set and I own two but only have one built up. The parts for my second one are around the place but I can't seem to find them. I love this set and it is the only set from the Life on Mars sets that I have got a alien in. 
Pluses:
* Cool to play with 
* Fun to build
* Not to expensive
* Cool Alien minifig
* Vehicle design is great

Minuses:
* NONE

Overall this is a great set and if your planning on getting a Life on Mars set which includes an alien, get this one.

"smiley905","2008-01-18T21:38:40.7Z","hmm..","i dont realy get the design, i mean it could fly fine but how can it walk on one leg? this is still an ok set, and it would be great if i liked it, its totaly durable, and includes a cool alian, but i just dont like it, i think its better as parts than the modle.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-03T20:18:20.013Z","Actually pretty good!","This set really looks like it could fly and it even has the engines on the back to support this. The minifigure has cool hair and they never fail to amaze and impresse me. The is one of the better sets in this theme, and this represents the theme very well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-25T10:55:14.51Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - Red Planet Cruiser Review","This set is a very cool little set to have. It's supposed to be a robot and it looks ver cool. This model is really easy to build and this set is very sturdy as well. You also don't need to worry about stickers. The leg of the robot can be sviweled and there's also a laser gun, a computer and a small turret. On each side of the mech you can see an engine and on the back you can see a cool printed piece. The alien minifig is called 'Altair' and he's made out of a LEGO Star Wars battle droid torso and battle droid arms. Only the head and the legs are different. This set doesn't have many play features but it's a good little set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red Planet Cruiser is close to medium sized as far as vehicles go (when discussing classic Space vehicles.) and it is unique, it flies, but it also has&nbsp;a single robot leg to stand on. It probably hops around the planet using its engines to bounce around with high pressure pneumatics. The manipulator arms are tiny, but here's where those impulse sets come in handy, you can take the pieces from the Worker Robot and elongate the robot arms on the Red Planet Cruiser so that they actually look properly scaled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is very recommended. It may not have that many unique pieces, but the colors are nice and it is fun to play with. If you can get a copy of this set then don't pass it up.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
