"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-17T07:32:01Z","WICKED","This set is cool and you can detach the center from the front and back axles. I like the way it bobs up and down, but sometimes it can get too close to the ground and scrapes it. The wheels are cool and it is fun to play with.
Pluses:
* Fun to play with
* Doc (minifig)
* Cool set design
* Wheel format

Minuses:
* The cockpit scrapes the ground if you apply to much weight.

overall a great set and the way the wheels are fixed is cool.

Uses some technic parts, which at the time wasn't to common for regular LEGO sets. Set is well designed and my son and I enjoy playing with this one alot.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-04T14:56:52.483Z","T-3 Trike","One of the &quot;Life on Mars&quot; sets, released in 2001, this set is in a good size and features a good building with some technic style and system style pieces. The minifigure included is an astronaut, simple but nicely designed, that have too cool details and color scheme. The Trike is made with three wheels and it still in feet with some technic pieces. The big wheels are good positioned and also the base. In the front of the base, there is the cockpit. With a spherical piece in a good place, the minifigure stays very well in the cockpit and some pieces  above the blocks of the base are increasing the trike outside the cockpit. The playability and building, altough simple, is better than the MT-31 Trike, released in the Mars Mission theme. Overall, a good Trike of the Life on Mars theme, that combines useful pieces with a good building, color scheme, design and it is good to play with. 5/5  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It even beats the newer version they tried to copy. the minifigure is very cool and futuristic. The metal detcter on the back is a nice feature to add to the playability.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-12T05:19:00.453Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - T-3 Trike Review","It's been a while since I've written my last LEGO Space (Life On Mars) review on brickset. Today I'm going to review the T-3 Trike which is the older version from the LEGO Space (Mars Mission) MT-31 Trike set. This version from 2001 is a little bit shorter than the MT-31 Trike from 2007. The minifig we get here is called 'Doc'. He comes with a shiny blue visor which looks really cool and he has a white helmet. On the face he looks a little bit like George Lucas. You also won't have to worry about stickers.<br><br>The set is an easy built but it's a fun build. It's very sturdy and I like the way how LEGO did the headlights. The cockpit lifts up very easily and the driver fits in there nice and easy too. I also like the way how LEGO attached the wheels to the rubber bands. The combination with the blue and white colors are very cool as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Dash_Justice","2011-07-09T12:42:47.057Z","Much better than the Mars Mission Trike","<h4>The Good:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set is modular, and can be combined with other sets from Life on Mars. 
</li><li>Includes intersting pieces, grey wheels, tubes, with some in rare colors like sand blue. 
</li><li>Better design than the Mars Mission Trike.</li></ul>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The suspension sags due to the wight of the vehicle, two rubber bands on each tire fixes this problem. 
</li><li>Only 3 wheels, if you plan&nbsp;to make a four wheeled vehicle, you'll need another, 7310 Mono Jet should do the trick. 
</li><li>Requres other sets to expand playability.</li></ul>
<h4>The Verdict:</h4>
<p>A much better set than the horrid Mars Mission copy. Unique pieces, like the metal detector and windshield. No stickers, with two printed parts. Great little set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"AETerry","2011-02-10T14:25:06.527Z","T-3 Trike Review","<p>There was just something about the Life On Mars series that I just didn't like. And I often wonder why I bothered with getting this set. Probably for the new elements and pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a three-wheeler vehicle with a large circular dome to protect the driver. I didn't care too much for the minifigure design, even though the helmet with the metalic sheen is more realistic to modern or current astronauts. I just found myself not terribly inspired or liking this set. But there were elements such as the wheels and hoses on side that I wanted the parts for with other vehicles and ideas.</p>",TRUE,3,5,4,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T21:56:24.64Z","You Built a Time Machine... Whoops Wrong Doc.","<p>Set #7312 T-3 Trike: Life on Mars introduced an interesting concept if I'm not mistaken, the larger vehicles were modular and used Technic pieces to click together so that you could take the pieces of the larger models and mix and match them to make crazy looking off the wall models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The T-3 Trike I think was built by clicking two sections together, the front cockpit section with the two front tires and the rear section with the third tire. Using Technic pieces all three tire assemblies also used elastic bands to give it real working suspension. A unique take on building models and something I hadn't even considered before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doc, the Mini-Figure is apparently in charge of the entire Life on Mars exploration mission from LEGO Space. I can just see him using this vehicle to traverse the red planet seeking out the Martians and intent on forming a peace treaty. (I can also see him racing really fast and breaking the time space continnum barrier in order to travel through time, but that's just because I've been overexposed to Back to the Future.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to recommend this set to everybody who collects Space and wants to take advantage of the Life on Mars gimmick, because with all of the parts from this set and the others you can click together something really funky looking, but probably something totally fun to play with. This is one Sub-Theme in which I'd say skipping all of the smaller cheap sets is a good idea because the larger models were the real crown jewels of this Sub-Theme.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Stud_Sensei","2021-10-02T12:07:08.7Z","An Icon of the Early 2000s","<p>Ah, Life on Mars. You were taken from us too soon. Although certain elements of the line are now coveted - the dusty pinks and blues, the pearl-blue minifigure parts - it seems the sets themselves failed to make much of an impression on release in 2001, and little seems to have changed over the last 20 years. Despite this, one set remains in the collective FOL consciousness, and that would be&nbsp;<em>7312 T-3 Trike.</em></p>

<p>The boxart is decent - it hints at the main selling point (which we&#39;ll get to...) of the set and also cleverly hides the worst part of it, which we&#39;ll get out of the way early: its ungainly brick built frame. Although not a dealbreaker, there are definitely more graceful ways the main body might&#39;ve been constructed, as we&#39;ll discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Doc minifigure is nice, a step above the &#39;Assistant&#39; minifigure but unfortunately lacking the pearl-blue spacesuit piece present elsewhere in the line. He also gets some tools to use out on the Martian planes - something to enjoy once the excitement of the suspension wears off.</p>

<p>The suspension on this set!&nbsp;Although not the first time rubber-band suspension was implemented - my mind is drawn to&nbsp;<em>6617 Tough Truck Rally -</em>&nbsp;the trike is novel for how it impressively crams three-wheel independent into its diminutive frame, while remaining surprisingly balanced. This allows it a wide range of movement, that looks strikingly natural - rolling it over a rough surface produces an almost cinematic effect by how each wheel responds independently to deviations. Keeping the bands constantly under tension does mean that, as the set ages, it tends to sag - if you&#39;re intending to keep this set on display, it might be worth investing in some clear pieces to prop it up underneath.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the biggest&nbsp;mark against this set is that <em>7694 MT-31 Trike </em>exists. A testament to the iconic nature of the T-3, it was the only one of the original&nbsp;<em>Life on Mars</em>&nbsp;run to get an almost direct remake in the spiritual successor to the theme,&nbsp;<em>Mars Mission</em>, and&nbsp;one that improves upon almost all the design missteps of the T-3; it&#39;s less bulky, more stable on its three wheels and scores extra playability points for its alien transport feature. It also does away with the rubber-band based suspension, improving its longevity.</p>

<p>Despite the&nbsp;enhancements present in the MT-31, though, the T-3 remains a compelling design and set. It&#39;s perhaps the most striking example of the rugged, utilitarian design of the&nbsp;<em>LoM&nbsp;</em>theme, seamlessly blending more grounded design elements of dusty greys and pinks with the decidedly outlandish three-wheeler build, and the trick independent&nbsp;suspension remains impressive for such a small set, all these years on. In a line already woefully underappreciated, it&#39;s nice that at least this set was recognised for the ingenious design that it was.</p>
