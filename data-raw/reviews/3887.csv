"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T22:36:46Z","Life in Lego?","This was my second set in the Life on Mars theme, and initially, I was quite impressed. The cool Martian minifig is a must have; it is too bad there is only one included with this set. As for the Red Planet Protector itself, there is some play value in the sense that you can transform it by snapping off the guns and replacing them with the leg thrusters to make a flying vehicle. However, it is really only good for posing, as it lacks knees and practically any decent joint structure. The parts are very nice though, and comein good colors like blue and dark grey. Several custom pieces, like the big gun and cockpit, are great for Space MOCs. Overall, this set suffers in the fact it was released at a dark time for Lego. Bionicle had not quite started yet and Star Wars was a bittersweet victory. Though Life on Mars did not worsen the imbalance, it certaintly did not help it. The set's crudness might allow it to be easily overlooked compared to mech sets like the new Titan XP, but it is a nice-looking set, for display or MOCing uses. Take your pick.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-17T20:40:03Z","Nice, With my tweeking","I like the set, but at one point it smashed in half and some pieces lost, so i built a really nice flying ship, but of coruse that was short lived with a little kid in the house. Overall, A very nice set. It had some nice Engine Pieces, a nice amount of thouse cool ways to make the upper turrets. The joints needed work, mainly because there were few joints in the first place. I like the pipes on the back, and they still come in handy to this day (4 years after i got it) A nice set, and if you can find one, get one. Peace-Out",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"David1985","2007-11-24T01:16:22.373Z","Wonderful Set","I never understood why Mission to Mars sold as poorly as it did, they had some wonderful sets, and in my opinion they are better than most of the new Mars Mission sets.  The aliens are so much better, and they use the same tubes.  The sets are mechs which are better than half of the Exo-force mechs.

The set it well built and won't fall over easily.  Like i said the aliens are really great, the best Lego has ever made.  The colors and parts used are interesting.  I wish this theme continued because the alien sets were amazing.  I remember getting this set years ago and I had loads of fun with it.  If you can find it for sale it's a must buy in the new Lego space age.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-18T21:42:12.31Z","its ok","this set isnt as good as 7313 which for the same price is way better than this one. this one looks much better in fly mode than walk, becuase it has no arms. but still this is a cool set, and has lots of cool peices. the alian is very cool, and there is an amazing amount of cool peices in this set. it is realy quite good, just could use some arms.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-11-30T16:36:36.873Z","One of the only life on mars set i owned and it was...","Amazing! The minifigure is really neat, much cooler then the new martians, besides the commander. His face is very detailed. I got this set over the holidays. I was young at the time and my mom helped me build it. It had really cool weapons which it could have used to fight the humans, if they weren't at peace. Unfortunatly, it has nothing to fight in the end and doesn't actually contain a piece of gold. Lol just kidding!


AWESOME SET!

I like how you assemble it in parts so that if you have other Martian sets, you can take the parts and mix them up to make an awesome jumbo ship. This is a really good buy, and it is relly fun to play with, even though you can't do much with it unless you have similar sets. This is still a really nice set.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-05T11:39:14.583Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - Red Planet Protector Review","I don't remember it exactly but I think this is one of my first mechs I've ever built. It's a cool built and it has some nice play features. I also like the alien minifig. As I told you in my other LEGO Space (Life On Mars) reviews I you know that I like the life on mars aliens better than the mars mission ones. On the life on mars versions we can also find a battle droid torso and battle droid arms. These will be useful if you build a LEGO Star Wars droid army and if you want to build special droid elites. If you look close on the cover of the instruction you can see that the alien is going to pick up a piece. Before I opened the box I thought this piece was part of this set but it isn't. This confused me a little bit after I built this model.<br><br>The mech itself is not so bad. In fact: it's awsome. The legs are movable and I like the propellers with the lasers on each side which you can sviwel. The cockpit sviwels full 360Â° and the alien fits in very nice and easy.&nbsp; On each side of the cockpit you also get a laser which is really cool. You won't have to complain about stickers which makes the mech more valuable.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Life on Mars is one of those themes that up until recently seems to be forgotten about such as Roborider, Znap, and Time Cruisers.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Building process&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The build is relatively simple, although it has some of that 90&#39;s early 2000&#39;s simplicity. Multiple parts of a set are held together with Technic pins letting you mix and match the parts. The base build is a Mech in the back of the instruction booklet; it suggests you could turn it into a spaceship instead.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Parts&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">As previously mentioned, the parts are relatively basic. There are some specific-use parts such as the&nbsp; 2x4x5 jet engines or the hoses with a stud on one end. It also has 2 or 3 pieces, expertly printed to look like electronics. The color scheme of the bricks is dark gray and sand blue.&nbsp; It works well with a neon orange touch.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Playability&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">If I had had this set when I was 10, I would have played with it every day.&nbsp; Even though I&#39;m older, I can see the playability and the appeal of this set. The minifigure of the set is a weird blend of battle droid torso and humanoid features. It has seemingly come to a middle ground of not being as robotic looking but not quite human, which works for me. The figure has a limited range of articulation because it uses the same design as a battle droid. The Mech legs can move side to side, and up and down. The cockpit is connected by a Technic pin and can be popped off to make it fly around.</span></span></p>

&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Ending&nbsp; thoughts&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall I would give the set a 7 out of 10. There are some small problems that I think could be fixed by just adding a piece or two. If you want to buy this set, the average price today used is about $30. For a set that is 21 years old, this has withheld the test of time.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

"Stud_Sensei","2022-01-12T16:01:47.06Z","Look mom, no hands!","<p>Unlike the mech lineups today like those found in the&nbsp;<em>Marvel&nbsp;</em>sets, each of the mechs found in the <i>LoM&nbsp;</i>range are drastically distinct. Judging by eBay listings at the time of writing, this clearly didn&#39;t work out well for&nbsp;<em>7313 - Red Planet Protector</em>,&nbsp;which boasts notably fewer (and pricier) listings than its more conventional stablemate,&nbsp;<em>7314 - Recon Mech RP.</em>&nbsp;We&#39;ll see whether it rightfully deserves second-billing.</p>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>7314</em>,&nbsp;<em>7313</em>&nbsp;deviates from the mechanised norm and forgoes any arms, for two large fixed&nbsp;scanners / blasters on the upper torso, and a pair of hip-thrusters connected below. This reduces the range of poses available to the model drastically, but seems to be in order to incorporate its different design intent, as we&#39;ll see.&nbsp;<em>7313&nbsp;</em>also stands taller than&nbsp;<em>7314</em>, further differentiating their silhouettes, and lacks its more exciting parts, such as the container,&nbsp;claw or any accessories for the &#39;fig, which would&#39;ve bumped up its playability some. We do still get a nice sprinkle of small printed pieces, though, which is nice.</p>

<p>First, the figure. The sole minifigure included in this, Centauri, makes their only appearance outside a polybag in this set, and is about as decent as the&nbsp;<em>LoM&nbsp;</em>martians came, with a nicely printed respirator(?) head design and a blue body to match their mech. The limited articulation is disappointing, but this is nothing new for these &#39;droid&#39; style figures which LEGO has yet to improve in over 20 years of production, so the focus on compatible equipment and machinery throughout the range somewhat makes up for it.</p>

<p>Those upper torso armaments are where the frustrations start with this set. Instead of being fixed in place, or articulated, these are instead attached via a loose pin connection and held horizontal by a hinged piece. So, instead of the freedom to pose them, we get two choices: straight-forward, or dangling uselessly. Why couldn&#39;t these have given friction pins, at the very least? Why this non-choice, where one pose just looks flatly odd? This is repeated with the hip thrusters as well - they look great,&nbsp;incorporating the brilliant engine piece common to the range, and are admittedly more poseable,&nbsp;able to use their own weight to hold themselves in place at a range of angles - but again, it&nbsp;begs the questions of why not just use friction pins in their place?</p>

<p>The hint lies in one of the tags of this set on Brickset - &#39;converts&#39;. Indeed, these quirks seem to be in order to sell the second form of&nbsp;<em>7313&nbsp;</em>where, by removing its bottom half and plugging half of a leg into its back, it becomes some sort of clumsy flying machine (a UFO?). The free moving thrusters also seem to suggest that it can be&nbsp;used as a sort of VTOL, with each of the four thrusters pivoting to aim downwards while keeping the model in mech form. Unfortunately, neither of these forms are very well realised - the flying form is far too dumpy to feel like more than an afterthought, and looks like a similar (but worse) form of&nbsp;<em>7311 - Red Planet Cruiser</em>. And the model does not convince as a VTOL, because it still looks too much of a mech while doing it.&nbsp;Despite compromising its design as a mech, these design choices fail to make the model convince as a flying machine either. That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s a bad idea - a convertible flying mech sounds great! - but I wish they had gone further, perhaps adding more thrusters with better articulation, really making these features clear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a great core concept underpinning&nbsp;<em>7313</em>. Unfortunately, because of some truly bizarre design decisions, this concept ends up only vaguely gestured at, with neither of its two suggested forms being particularly well-executed and resulting in a confused, middling model. Still, despite these shortcomings, it inherits the <em>LoM&nbsp;</em>range&#39;s consistently&nbsp;excellent visual design and meshes well with the rest of the range, meaning it just about crosses the line into a recommendation.&nbsp;</p>
