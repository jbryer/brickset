First of all, I like the martians, they are very unique and can pose better than the average minifig. This walker robot has battery guns on either side, a claw on one side, and a flamethrower on the other. It is a mean, green......ahem.....red, fighting machine! You can get this fairly easily on bricklink and it is worth it, and if you have corrisponding life on mars sets and starwars sets, this'll be a real blast!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Evilnurn","2007-06-26T18:12:05.843Z","Nice","This set was my first Life on Mars set, so I went in with no expectations and I was impressed.

Pros:
Features objects like the canister in the back, claw, good maneuverability. I really liked  when Lego moved into this mech theme. The legs are quite sturdy, and quite fun. The use of different new pieces and old ones makes this set a good fusion.

Cons:
Other than some dinky limbs and a dinky right hand weapon, I really liked this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-08-20T00:59:36.81Z","The best Life on Mars set of them all","The Recon Mech was always my favorite LoM set. It's such a huge leap forward from the awful Exo-Force series, and it came out years earlier. Life on Mars is THE theme for Mechs. 

PROS:

- Excellent new pieces. The new cockpit, hoses, claw, and printed tiles all stack up to an incredibly useful parts pack.

- The legs, while without knees, work fine. Nothing flops over.

- The claw works.

- Awesome detail... one of the best looking Mechs I've ever seen. It looks as good on display as it does on the box (although there's no cool Mars background included :P) 

- Great alien! Wish the Mars Mission aliens could have been more like this, but less robotic. 

- Great price! 

CONS:

- Construction is pretty study, but the shafts connected to the tank on the back of the body sometimes fall off. Also, the hoses pop off once in awhile.

- No knees. 

VERDICT:

This set is one of the greatest Mars Mission sets released! Too bad this theme was so short-lived... and too bad the modern revival wasn't very faithful to it. At least we'll always have this awesome Mech as a hallmark of the good old days. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-26T00:36:14.687Z","pretty cool","the first mech for lego is pretty cool and im glad the made more. it has lots of wepons and the law is realy good and will pick stuff up. if you detach the legs and hook them on the back it makes a space ship. the legs are a bit hard to pose and wobaly but there not that bad. this set has lots of good peices so it is ok to take apart. there are lots of printed bricks and pipes. this set is pretty good and worth getting",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The claw hand is awesome, just be sure to have some extra rubber bands. The arms and back are very well designed as well. Cool function: if you seperate the mech, you can re attach it as a space station. I give this a 4 because the legs have very little stability and moveability. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-02T10:07:01.94Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - Recon Mech RP Review","I remember I got this set when I was on a vacation. I'm really glad to have it because it's a rare set and it also comes with a rare LEGO Space (Life On Mars) minifig. The built of this mech is fantastic and you also won't get any stickers which you have to worry about. I've also seen a rare red color (I mean the color on the container on the back). The cockpit does open and you can see a screen.<br><br>You can get the alien in this mech very easily. We also see a laser on each side and the whole cockpit with the movable arms sviwels full 360Â°. The arm on the one side comes with a flame and the other one has a claw which looks like a rare piece to the LEGO Space (Life On Mars) theme. The legs are movable as well and the whole set is very sturdy. I really can't complain about this model and I think you should try to find it.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-21T22:04:45.7Z","RP stands for Red Planet","<p>Set #7314 Recon Mech RP: Of the two mecha released in the Life on Mars sub-theme for the Martians (that wasn't part of a larger set.) I'd have to say that this mecha is a better set than the Red Planet Protector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Recon Mech RP involves three step modular building, step one build the legs, step two build the cockpit and arms, step three build the backpack, step four, snap them all together with Technic pieces to make a fully functional mecha. Of all the sets I had this is the one I wished I'd kept the most, then I could stage mock battles between my single Exo-Force set and this one on display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arms are articulate enough to make some pretty good poses and you could detach the legs from the bottom and re-attach them to the backpack piece using the Technic pieces to make a flying mecha with the legs splayed out behind it as it hovers along to prevent invaders from discovering the hidden Martian cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Recon Mech RP and Red Planet Protector can be combined of course, but since I never actually had the Red Planet Protector I can't comment on this feature, although I'd have to imagine it looks great and makes the Red Planet Protector look much better.</p>
<p>Overall I recommend this set to any mecha fans or Space fans that are looking for something to add to their display that isn't just 'another' space ship.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"sitkawitka","2012-01-21T11:47:31.57Z","MEGA MECH","I got this set on ebay for 17.98 which I think is a good price. It did not have the box and was not built. I've gotta say compared to some of the exo force mech's this is a pretty easy build. It stays together well. And you can take the legs off and put it to the back of cock pit and make it fly. If you already have a life on mars alien minfig then you probably won't get too excited about the minifig. I already had one so I was'nt too excited about the minifig. But you don't get this set for the minifig this is one of those set's you get for the vehicle. So over all this is an excellent set I have no complaint's. &nbsp;&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,3,5,3
"Stud_Sensei","2022-01-05T17:40:39.467Z","The first (real) mech of many","<p><em>7314 - Recon Mech RP&nbsp;</em>is one of two bipedal mechs in the LoM range, and definitely the most traditional of the two, featuring regular arms absent from&nbsp;<em>7313 - Red Planet Protector.&nbsp;</em>It may also be the first &#39;proper&#39; mech to be rendered in LEGO form.</p>

<p>Although commonplace now, mechs were previously difficult to render in LEGO form. Stifled by a&nbsp;lack of suitable - or suitably strong - joint parts, the resulting designs&nbsp;being either the clumsily static, wheeled products of the short-lived <i>Roboforce</i>&nbsp;or a shuffling walker ala&nbsp;<em>4940 - Granite Grinder.</em>&nbsp;All changed with the introduction of ratchet joints in 1999. Outside its stable-mate&nbsp;<em>7313, 7314</em>&#39;s closest spiritual predecessor may actually lie in&nbsp;<em>7127 -&nbsp;Imperial AT-ST,&nbsp;</em>bridging the gap between the shuffling articulation of old and the ratcheting leg articulation featured here, though&nbsp;<em>7314</em>&nbsp;was the first to bring those elements &#39;above the belt&#39; as well.</p>

<p>As a first attempt, the range of motion&nbsp;impresses, but it isn&#39;t a patch on modern sets&nbsp;- although there are a&nbsp; high number of joints in its limbs, this set still predates any sort of ball joint, so each joint can only move in a single axis - but&nbsp;<em>7314</em>&nbsp;still represents a remarkable step-up over anything that came before, with limbs that move independently of the main structure and can rotate freely. Its lack of knee joints is unfortunate, though, restricting the poses possible without causing the model to topple. The&nbsp;pivot connecting the upper and lower body does result in some unsightly wobbling too.</p>

<p><em>7314&nbsp;</em>is also modular&nbsp;like much of the LoM range,&nbsp;allowing segments from different sets to be combined in a number of ways. As an adult, this doesn&#39;t register as much more than a gimmick, though, something fun for the kids perhaps; the colours of the different sets don&#39;t mesh particularly well, and the final product inevitably has too many cockpits and sets of legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So with the novelty of its design long since worn off, and the gimmicks underwhelming,&nbsp;what else is there to commend this set for? Well, that would be the glorious,&nbsp;glorious,&nbsp;design. In keeping with the rest of the LoM range, <em>7314</em>&nbsp;forgoes the ubiquitously&nbsp;sleek sci-fi aesthetic from the Space subtheme of old for a more grounded, utilitarian take. It&#39;s squat, deceptively so,&nbsp;but wide, with bulky blunt-sided segments conveying the mass of heavy machinery.&nbsp;Dusty pink lowlights give it an understated, weather-beaten edge, while functional details like stepladders on the &#39;hip&#39; sections for entry and greebling&nbsp;details like grab handles, cooling vents and feedpipes lend it striking plausibility as a design. LEGO likes to keep the armaments of its space vehicles vague to encourage diversity of play, making them ambiguously serve as weapons or tools. Most of the LoM sets fall too heavily into the second camp, but&nbsp;<em>7314</em>&nbsp;walks the tightrope deftly, its claw menacing but practical, the flamethrower playing the role of either excavation tool or offensive weapon convincingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build-wise, it&#39;s all so 2001. There are no surprises in wait, just straightforward layered&nbsp;brick buildup, with some unfortunate repetition in the arm and leg sections. There are some nice pieces, though; Beyond a smattering of dusty pink pieces, the model also contains some other interesting elements common to the LoM theme - the footpads, canopy, claw (designed to&nbsp;fit&nbsp;the boulder elements found elsewhere) and a range of small printed pieces almost unheard of now. The minifigure, Antares, is unique to this set&nbsp;- a nice bonus.</p>

<p>In a sea of anonymously futuristic space vehicles,&nbsp;<em>7314 - Recon Mech RP&nbsp;</em>is a striking outsider. Although since surpassed in the technical details of its articulation, it remains&nbsp;a vividly imagined forbearer of mechs to come, unique in its design, and given its extremely reasonable price&nbsp;on the used market, it is&nbsp;well worth picking up.</p>
