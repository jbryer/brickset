"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-17T07:36:34Z","ONE OF MY FAVOURITES","This is a really cool set. It can detach three parts and it has the small moonbuggy in the hull. the cockpit is cool and so are the engines. If this set wasn't so heavy at each end you could swoosh it around for hours.
Pluses:
* Cool Shuttle
* Three minifigs
* Red rock
* moonbuggy attaches in

minuses:
* moonbuggy sometimes breaks when you try to dettach it

Overall a must get and a great buy. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

            The first set I reviewed was this set, so I will review again. The Solar Explorer is actually a very good set and is probably the best Life on Mars set. I like the design of the ship and the fact that you can make it smaller by removing the base on the ship. The rover is actually very cool and it can carry rocks which is the best part of the rover. Overall, I have to say this is a great set and is a must have for Life on Mars fans. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It comes with a miner which looks very different from the current miners in the mars mission theme, and i actually like this one better. The ship is pretty sleek and futuristic looking, and the humans included in this set are cool. One of the best sets in this theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set is odd because it seems to be like it is a ship 20 years from now. I always like the modularity of it and the nice variety of pieces.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-11T10:28:27.933Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - Solar Explorer Review","This space ship is one of my favourite space ships of the LEGO Space theme I've ever built. I love the design of thos set and the piece of plastic with the solar cells in the middle. In the middle we also get a rover which has a translucent orange meteorite with a crystal in it. You also get a radar and a cockpit where you can put in two minifigs. The engine looks very awsome as well. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs. We get Doc who has the white suit with the shiny blue visor, we get BB who has a shiny blue helmet and visor. His face reminds me a little bit of the Pepper Roni character from the LEGO island videogame. The other minifig is Mac who got a black suit. This set is really sturdy and a great built. You also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"ra226","2018-04-02T19:32:25.86Z","Over-simplified, but some fun features.  One of the better LoM sets","<p>I recently picked up this set to finally fill a hole in my Life on Mars collection. &nbsp;LoM was never a theme I was looking to complete (I have no interest in the larger sets in the theme), but this shuttle always caught my eye. &nbsp;Now that I have it in hand, it&#39;s pretty much what I expected: nice looking, somewhat &quot;juniorized,&quot; but with some excellent play features.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The fantastic printed canvas that covers the midsection looks great. &nbsp;It was what originally attracted me to the set and it fits the &quot;not too distant future&quot; feel of Life on Mars perfectly. &nbsp;The colors also look great on this set--everything works well, nothing sticks out as wrong. &nbsp;The white with hilights of black, copper, sand blue, and other muted tones fit perfectly.</li>
	<li>Highly modular design. &nbsp;The set breaks down into 4 pieces (5 if you count the rover contained in the midsection) which can be mixed and matched into several configurations. &nbsp;I think the ship looks great with the midsection removed and just the satellite between the shuttle and the drive section. &nbsp;You can remove the satellite too, but it looks a bit squat in that config. &nbsp;Not only is this modularity fun in its own right, but the entire LoM theme is designed this way so the shuttle&#39;s modules integrate easily with the other sets, both martian and human.</li>
	<li>As previously mentioned, the ship looks great with the midsection removed. &nbsp;In its complete form the ship takes on a completely different personality. &nbsp;It trades swooshability for a more utilitarian, almost klunky look. &nbsp;But given its near-future feel, I&#39;m ok with that. &nbsp;What it lacks in style (something the earlier space sets of the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s had in abundance) it makes up for in functionality. &nbsp;In that respect, it&#39;s almost a sort of heir to the very first Classic Space sets of the late 70&#39;s.</li>
	<li>The set has tons of playability. &nbsp;The vehicle hangar midsection can be left planet-side and the rover can recover a large meteorite which can then be returned to the ship for study. &nbsp;There&#39;s one of those great guns with a site that can be used to crack it open revealing the mysterious interior of the stone. &nbsp;The satellite looks like a robot when you fold the legs down, and the top was clearly meant to be removed for storage. &nbsp;The shuttle section seats two, back-to-back.&nbsp; The rover has a movable arm.</li>
	<li>No stickers, and some nice printed parts, especially the DaVinci-esque minifig motion diagram on the 2x2 round tile. &nbsp;There are also some appropriate computer screens and of course the canvas over the midsection.</li>
	<li>The minifigs are excellent. &nbsp;Varying design in the faces, actual metallic chrome visors (not the pearl stuff used in later parts). &nbsp;They look really great, and I love that they have grey facial hair--these are space veterans with a lot of experience working in this environment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Let&#39;s come right and say it--this design is compromised, simplistic, and juniorized. &nbsp;Not completely, but there are points that are painfully boring. &nbsp;The 4x4 cone on the nose just stuck on there, the giant single-piece nose/wing plate, the overly-large engine pieces just wedged in between the arches on the drive section are just a few examples. &nbsp;There are a lot of single, big pieces that would have looked much better as several smaller pieces to bring out detail.&nbsp; The very first step of the build is that wing plate which does not begin things on a positive note. &nbsp;Maybe the set was designed for younger builders, but there are enough other, more complicated elements that I just considered it insulting. &nbsp;It also limits the imagination when attempting to build original creations from the parts. &nbsp;The vehicle hanger particularly stands out--once you remove the canvas covering, is literally just a rectangular frame. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>The rover doesn&#39;t fit in the bay very well. &nbsp;If you leave the rock on the arm, it bumps against the canvas, distorting its shape (permanently if you leave it that way too long). &nbsp;It also doesn&#39;t come out easily, typically breaking apart rather than disengaging from the two technic pins holding it in. &nbsp;Both problems are solved if you clip it in upside-down. &nbsp;This for some reason doesn&#39;t bother me and has the added benefit of the wheels not sticking out under the frame.</li>
	<li>The canvas deforms at the attach points as well as if something is pushing up against it. &nbsp;Held in the wrong place for to long and it&#39;s a permanent issue (mine is slightly warped because of this). &nbsp;I would recommend leaving it permanently attached with nothing pushing against it and removing the rover from underneath rather than detaching the canvas to get to it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Neutral</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Landing pads. &nbsp;It&#39;s nice these are here at all, but they&#39;re very simplistic. &nbsp;I think back to the very earliest Classic Space sets like #928 and #918, which had stanchions and thrusters for landing. &nbsp;A few scattered 2x2 round plates just don&#39;t do it for me. &nbsp;Landing gear would have been excellent.</li>
	<li>The canopy is not on a hinge and must be removed to get the minifigs&nbsp;in and out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Life on Mars is a funny theme--in many ways, it&#39;s distinctly Lego with its intentional lack of story, leaving that to the imagination of the builder. &nbsp;There are not a lot of hints in the manuals and on the boxes as to what exactly is going on on Mars, but my interpretation is that we showed up on Mars in the not too distant future (say, 2050 or so) only to find aliens already there, who seem to be consumed with the mysteries surrounding a particular mineral native to the planet. &nbsp;Friendly and willing to share, the Martians and the humans end up working together to unlock the secrets of this mineral, perhaps some kind of power source.</p>

<p>I love that Life on Mars is a peaceful, exploratory theme. &nbsp;Sure there are a few guns here and there, but they&#39;re attached to ships with clips and feel more like hand tools than ship-mounted weapons. &nbsp;The Martian mechs are similarly ambiguous--probably capable of combat, but almost certainly not designed for it. &nbsp;And the ease with which human and Martian modules can&nbsp;be interchanged clearly indicates that our two races are working together.&nbsp; Contrast this with the later Mars Mission theme, where the creepy Martians are our adversaries to be fought against and captured. &nbsp;I can only assume these are not the same continuity because I&#39;d hate to think what could have happened to our pleasant little blue friends to turn them into those fearsome creatures.</p>

<p>In the end, Life on Mars was a short-lived, mostly-forgotten space theme, in a long line of similarly forgotten space themes from the mid-90&#39;s on. &nbsp;On the one hand I feel it&#39;s underappreciated, but on the other, I can see why it&#39;s fallen into obscurity. &nbsp;Up against the excitement of Star Wars, LoM just seems to lack something. &nbsp;The Solar Explorer feels the same--some good features, but somewhat compromised and lacking that special something. &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;s the&nbsp;ambiguous story, maybe it&#39;s the simplified designs, or maybe kids just aren&#39;t interested in mining and exploration, I&#39;m not sure.&nbsp; So, while I do like this set, I know it will never be one of my favorites.</p>

<p>If you have other LoM sets and are missing this one, I&#39;d say this is one of the better ones of the theme and would recommend picking it up. &nbsp;It&#39;s not held a lot of value and is cheaper now than it was at retail, so either way it&#39;s a good value. &nbsp;But if LoM holds no interest for you, this set is not going to do anything to change that.</p>
