The little ship is good, but if the martian's arm slips, he'll fall backwards pretty far. The rest of it looks pretty high tech and is overall a very cute and enjoyable set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-07T05:26:49.073Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - Excavation Searcher Review","I don't remember it exactly anymore but I think I got this set when I was in LEGOLAND in Denmark. This set is a great set to have and we get lot's of play features. All pieces we get here are printed and we don't have any stickers to complain about. We get three aliens in this model. The aliens are called Canopus, Pollux and Vega. Vega is the figure with the orange torso and legs. Pollux is the one with the gray torso and legs. The torsos and arms are the same pieces which we've seen in the LEGO Star Wars battle droid minifigs. If you want to build some special battle droid elites these LEGO Space (Life On Mars) alien torsos and arms will be very useful.<br><br>This set comes with a great platform as well. This platform can hold one of the meteorite (we get two of them in total) which is the translucent orange piece which we've seen in the LEGO Rock Raiders theme a lot. We also get some cool crystals in there. The 'legs' of the platform are movable as well. The main attraction of this set is the big mech. The mech comes with two legs on each side which can be moved. There's also an arm with a laser and an arm with a claw which can hold the meteorites. The cockpit can be opened very easily and the aliens fit in there very nice and easy. We also get some sviwel headlights on the top and a crane which can pick up the meteorites. The crane does sviwel full 360°. You also get a place where you can store these meteorites. Underneath the the mech you can see a little speeder which can be maneuvered very easily. This set is an awsome set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Lego_Lord_Mayorca","2011-01-29T17:48:39.02Z","Unwanted, But Not Unused","By the Spring of 2001, I was done with Lego Life on Mars. I don't mean that in an angry way. I loved the theme. When I first saw a poster for it in the Mania Magazine in November 2000, I was quite excited. After all, Star Wars sets were hitting a slump of sorts in design (i.g. the Slave I and A-wing) and I did quite miss Space-like sets. I started finding LoM sets on Wal-Mart shelves in December of 2000, and they dominated my Christmas list. By January 2001, I had the T-3 Trike, the Red Planet Protector, the Shuttle Explorer (the astronaut's ship, not sure if that is the correct name), and the Recon Mech RP. And I was perfectly content.<br><br>The rest of the theme seemed unnecessary to my collection, so imagine my surprise when for Christmas in 2001, my uncle plops 7316 Excavation Searcher in front of me. It took all of my strength not to grimace. First of all, I never liked the look of this mech. Compared to the other two I owned, I found it cumbersome and not really ""battle-ready"" like the other two were. Plus, I was no big fan of tan. Second of all, Star Wars had taken it to 11 for 2002, and many of the new sets were already out and claiming my interest for Christmas. <br><br>But, still being a hardcore believer in accepting all Lego is good, no matter what form it takes as a set, I decided to open the box and give the Excavation Searcher a chance. Here is what I found out.<br><br>Looking at the box, I was pleased to discover there was an alternate ""upright"" mode for the mech so it could stand alongside the other two. This pleased me, so that made diving into the building process a lot easier. However, I soon found myself not being too enthused. I was flying through each step of the process because I was so familiar with the basic ""assemble legs, snap on here, assemble arms, snap on here, etc."" process that I discovered with the first two I got a year before. Plus, being bigger, it had some extra stuff like the portal/gate that could be connected to the Martian base (which I do not own, making this addition to the set mostly useless) and a mid-section for transporting the orange Martian rocks that contained a valuable fuel source. For that, I was at least grateful because it gave me two more of those orange boulders that I could have the astronauts collect or have the Recon Mech RP snatch away.<br><br>Even so, I wasn't having the genuine fun in building that I was accustomed to. An even more telling testament to this is how fuzzy my memory is regarding the whole process. It's like I found it so un-exhilarating that I have started erasing it from my mind! As a life-long Lego collector and builder, this scares me way too much. And I was only 13 at the time! Anyway, I do distinctly recall a final disgust upon assembly the ""tail"" of the beast, moonlighting as a crane to pick up the orange Mars rocks. It was such an uninspired, simplistic design. It bore the hallmarks of the cranes found on tow trucks in the Town/City line at the time, and since I want to avoid a huge tangent, let me merely state I completely LOATHED the direction the Town theme had taken with vehicle design since about 1997. Hence, I loathed this crane on the Excavator.<br><br>As I built, I was pleased by finding more nice pieces to add to my collection. Aside from the aforementioned boulders, I loved having three more Martians to add to my collection. I The addition of several small discs, the orange parts, and having another cool canopy piece pleased me as well. I then began to realize what this set would truly do for me. More on that in a bit.<br><br>Playing with the set was a rare occurrence. For a while, I kept the mech in upright mode. In spite of that, I was discomforted by the rest of the set taking up so much space (my shelves at this point were bursting over with sets from all themes that I had been collecting since 1994). Interestingly enough, the most playable part of the set was the little glider that could be attached underneath the mid-section via some Technic pins. It was very fun to swoosh around with the little Martian clinging for dear life. More so than anything else in the set, I had the most fun with that small addition, and probably would've bought it if that's all the set was (that and about $40 cheaper).<br><br>In the end though, my lukewarm reception of the final product cooled to absolute zero, and the set took on new usefulness as a parts resource. It started with the orange rocks and continued with the black cone on the arm with the orange radar dish. Eventually, I was pulling all sorts of parts from it when I needed something special for my other creations. The Excavation Searcher became my first set to become a parts bin in and of itself. The final straw came when I moved in 2003. Already mostly in pieces, it was one of the first to be packed up. I haven't opened it since.<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
