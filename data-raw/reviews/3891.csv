TUBES:

You can put those aliens inside and squeeze it. 

AIRPLANE:

YOu can put the aleins inside it, and it connects to something, but I forgot what.

ALIENS:

The aliens are cool. I like the green ones best. I don't know his name, though.
I use them with other space sets.

"Ovid07","2007-07-11T07:49:02.53Z","Classic LOM Set","This is probably the best LOM set.  And nowadays a classic (mars mission has nothing on this set).  This was the first set to introduce the tubes. And in this set they are awesome, the aliens fly through the tubes and over the vallis marinaris, to their stations.  Speaking of which their is an extra hook-up included for the staton in 7316:).  This set also includes a mini robot walker, a mini plane and the main base unit.  This is an amazing set, so if get a chance at it nowadays go for it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-26T20:00:38.927Z","Space Revival?","I was a little confused when Life on Mars was released. Was it supposed to revive the Space theme, which ended when Star Wars started, or was it supposed to be totally unique. Overall, I think it is very different from any previous Space subtheme, so I think it is a new them altogether. That said, I think this set is pretty good. It gets top marks for creativity with the tubes that send the Martians around the base. But, in my opinion, Lego's old space bases were a little better overall. Apart from the tubes, there really isn't much to this set. I have to wonder what exactly it is. Overall, it is a very original set, but something that combines a unique function with a base like Ice Station Odyssey, is a better set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-10T14:09:39.607Z","Gimmicky and tacky.","This set is an example of what is wrong with modern original science-fiction themed Lego sets.  It's all just silly gimmicks with no real opportunity for building.  The pump firing the aliens along tubes might have seemed a good idea on paper, but in practice it's all just cumbersome and ugly.  As with many modern sets, there are far too many different colours and an over-reliance on big or over-specialised pieces.  The base has been designed to look as big as possible without any thought being put into its design.  It's just far too open and skimpy, has very little detail or interesting features.  When I pay the kind of money this set cost I expect a good amount of Lego pieces, not something which looks like it's been put together from pieces of a vacuum cleaner.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

the walker was the first one i got and i got the small astornaut ship with and i only battled them 100 times and then i bought bigger ships to go with each army then for christmas i got the astronaut base and the alien base and i had so much fun so if you are young or know someone young go on ebay and buy them (if you have enough money :.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-01T15:26:33.763Z","Very awesome","Thi set is pretty neat, being one of the first sets to use a primitive pump system tha would later be a staple in mars mission. Anyway, the color scheme is totally wicked and the set includes five martians which looks really neat. this is an aweomse set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-14T05:37:25.19Z","LEGO Space (Life On Mars) - Aero Tube Hanger Review","This set is one of my favourite LEGO sets all time. It has lot's of play value and it comes with some rare alien minifigs. I love the way how LEGO designed that base. It has a little base on each side which has a bridge. On the base in the middle we have a crane with a meteorite, and a bridge on the top which is also the place where the space ship can land. The space ship has some nice turbines and the cockpit can be opened. The controls are printed on a piece which LEGO actually uses on flags. This set also includes a mech. The legs and the arms are movable. One arm has a gun and the other one has a hook. The cockpit itself sviwels full 360°. The main attraction is to get the aliens through the tubes. On the back of the big base you can see a big pump which you can use to push the aliens to the red, the blue or the smaller platform. You can use a gear which can move the tube which is attached to the big pump to decide where the alien minifig on his sledge should go. This is one of the best play features I've ever seen!<br><br>The minifig value is also very good. We get 5 minifigs - 4 are exclusive to this set. The first minifig is Vega who's not exclusive. He has the orange LEGO Star Wars battle droid torso and legs. We also get Mizar who has the light purple torso and legs, Cassiopeia (she's the only female LEGO Space - Life On Mars alien) with the purple torso and legs and Riegel who has the black torso and legs. He also has a green head and green battle droid arms. On his torso you can also see a little symbol. I think he's the chief of these aliens. The last alien minifig is Arcturus who has a red torso, red legs and lime green battle droid arms and a lime green head.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2010-06-11T19:21:59.5Z","An Amazing Set, Playable, Great Parts, Unique to the Extreme","<h4>Playability</h4><div>The set is amazingly playable. You can shoot martians through aero tubes, fly around a spaceship or play with the mech, use the crane to deliver the boulders, and more. The only issue I had with this set was the fact that the aero tube system is not perfect and does not always launch as effectively as I wish. In fact, I could not get it to work until my younger brother showed me how to.</div><h4>Building the Set</h4><div>This took a bit of time to build because of the abundance of parts. There are a few odd techniques not used as often in System Sets. The colors are easy to distinguish, although Black looks as if it were Dark Gray and Dark Gray as if it were Grey.</div><h4>Parts</h4><div>Worth your money. The parts are great, many unique to this set. There are a few parts which appear similar to slot bricks but are actually used in gear turning. The tubes, pump and tube ends are great and can be used in many sets. There are some good TECHNIC gears and parts, and some really good TECHNIC+System parts. The most important thing is color. The colors or Life on Mars are not common to many other themes. Mostly Sand colors with the Black, Light Gray and Dark Gray found in many sets. It comes with many parts in Sand Blue, Red, and Purple that do not come in that color in more than one other set.</div><h4>Value for Money</h4><div>I do not have much to say here because I bought it on Bricklink. It cost me 65 dollars (US) which is an absolute bargain. For 65 it's worth it. For 90, it'd still be worth it. If I had the money and it was a brand new set I'd buy it for up to 130 dollars.</div><h4>Overall</h4><div>The set rocks. It is one of my favorite all time sets and is great in a collection. The parts have insanely good value, the building is fun, and the set is extremely playable.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"CheeseyLU","2012-09-18T20:00:55.64Z","A awesome, unique, and fun set for LEGO fans of all ages!","<p>This is a downright fantastic set. There's nothing else like it, not even Eagle Command Base from Mars Mission. It's unique, fun, and a very well designed set.</p><p> </p><p>My favorite part about this set is its special pieces and colors. The tubes, pump, and arches are some pieces we don't see at all anymore. The purple hue blends very nicely with the theme, and the minifigures are fantastic. The bricks are all printed, which you can't beat. You can combine with other Life on Mars sets to even make it bigger and better.</p><p> </p><p>Playablilty, it's number 1. The martians going throught the Aero Tubes to their vehicles is a really neat idea. Again we get another unique piece with the Martian sliding thingies. :P</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's a little bit expensive for an older set, but it was well worth the price.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"awesometoa","2018-02-24T13:10:14.99Z","7317: Aero Tube Hanger","<p>The <strong>Aero Tube Hanger</strong> is an interesting LEGO set. The set comes with one main base, equipped with an area to hold a meteorite and a removable jet. Connected to the base are two platforms that look like they have umbrellas attached. Behind the base is a pump, the pump is larger than I expected but actually looks good next to the base. On the front of the base are two tubes, one leads to a&nbsp; junction while the other carries on to a&nbsp; terminal, likely entrance/exit to the base. From the junction two tubes lead to red and blue <em>hangers</em>, which can hold <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7314-1/Recon-Mech-RP""><em>7314: </em></a><em><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7314-1/Recon-Mech-RP"">Recon Mech</a></em><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7314-1/Recon-Mech-RP""><em> RP</em></a> and <em><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7313-1/Red-Planet-Protector"">7313: Red Planet Protector</a> </em>respectively. Furthermore, the large hanger included in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7316-1/Excavation-Searcher""><em>7316: Excavation Searcher </em></a>can be attached to the terminal, giving the Aero Tube Hanger three <em>hanger</em> sections instead of two.</p>

<p>Pros &amp; Cons</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Good Minifigure selection.</li>
	<li>The base is large and impressive.</li>
	<li>Interesting colour scheme.</li>
	<li>The tube system is functional and fun to play with.</li>
	<li>Comes with Martian jet and walker.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set is flimsy/liable to break</li>
	<li>Walker isn&#39;t very articulate.</li>
