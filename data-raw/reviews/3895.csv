"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:42:28Z","The obscure middle child","Out of the three basic sets of the early 1980s, I would say that the bricks of my 733 are in the newest condition.  I bought it for myself in the summer of 1982 because the toy store only had one left and I already had the 722 and 744.  (As it turned out, I’m glad I got it – that was the last time I saw the 733 for sale.)

If you didn’t already have a Lego collection, the 733 would have been a good set with which to start off.  It contains more pieces than does the 722, but it’s not as (possibly) intimidating to the uninitiated as the battery-powered 744 might have been.  The types of parts found within the 733 are comparable to the 722, but this time they are mostly blue (everybody likes blue!) pieces.  It has a set of instructions, out of which the tractor-trailer rig was my preference), and just like the other basic sets, it comes with a set of sorting trays.  Compare it to the 911 of the 1970s.

I think the 733 was (and is) a cool set, it’s just that by the time I got it, I had moved well into Technic territory.  It still gets a 9/10 for being there when I needed it, 25 April 2004

"huxley75","2017-09-11T15:37:43.9Z","First LEGO set","<p>This was the first LEGO set I ever got and - as a bonus - my mother and father bought me the same set so I got 2 instead of 1! My mother thought we should return the second set but I was quick to say &quot;It&#39;s LEGOs, we don&#39;t need to take anything back to the store; I&#39;ll play with both sets!&quot;</p>

<p>I can recall building the various models in this set over and over and over again and still have most of the parts; unfortunately some of the wheel hubs have cracked/split over time and a crank handle broke off at some point, as well.</p>

<p>As my first set I recall using the plastic parts trays for a while until I needed something bigger to organize my LEGOs. I still have all the instructions books for every set I ever got/bought, this set included. It&#39;s a bit dog-eared but, as a basic set for starting any LEGO collection, this was the perfect beginning.</p>
