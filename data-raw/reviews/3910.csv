<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set has 20 pieces including a free AA battery. Comes with instruction and an illustration of the clock. It had a 1 year guarantee warranty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was produced by QPF UK Ltd. under license from the LEGO Group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its set number is #4168039.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems you will get a random Noble Kanohi Ruru (likely for the international set. Need to confirm on that.) or Kanohi Miru.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Kanohi are red color as shown on pictures on the internet and the back of the box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No other changes to the clock other than that piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box I have, has an old department store&#39;s price sticker which retail the clock at $29.99 in 2002.</p>

<p>That store&#39;s SKU was #990860156. The UPC was 048337998331.</p>
