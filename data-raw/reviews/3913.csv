When I see now lots of very nice new models produced by Lego, I am missing little bit building sets, where you can build several different models. I know we still have creator and different themes (like planes, cars, etc.). But if you remember about the old times when you can build from building set no matter if technic, basic, creator, different models like buildings, cars, ships, trucks, planes, etc. from just one building set.

And the best thing was that this set also has motor equiped.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

","I got this kit in 1987 when I was 8 years old, and it started something that endured until the teenage years, when I swapped the toy cars for real cars, but in those Lego years, I had fun with Lego, lots of fun, I built a village out of it, I used to build houses that were loaded with some very realistic features, such as cavity walls, joists, floors, internal walls, fitted kitchens, staircases, front and back doors, integral garage that a corgi car could fit in with a workshop at the back, I've built cars, buses, coaches, even built a 3 level car transporter once, used to make sort of demonstration mechanisms as well out of lego, my favourite was car wipers! <br>",TRUE,3,4,4,4,4
