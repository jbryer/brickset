"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-27T14:21:22Z","Cool","This set has great playability. Lord Sam Sinister (a combination between the old Sam Sinister and Baron Von Baron) walks passed the tomb, the lid gows up, and the skelly pops out, a great set for a low price. I dont now if it was the packaging machine or what, but i got an extra 2 jewels!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get two mini figures a few jewels and some guns to add to the Adventures Orient Expedition collection. I do like the way the skeleton pops up to suprise Sam. Price and fun - this set can't be beat. If you are into the Adventure series this set is a must have.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-06T02:07:25.427Z","Surprise","This set is one of the smaller models from the orient expedition. I consists of a tomb and Sam sinister.

The tomb is quite bulky with a flag and marker on top. When you push down on the peg at the front the lid flies open and you are staring at a skeleton holding two crystals. It works best at a nice medium speed. Too slow and the skeleton gets his head hooked in the lid. Too fast and the skeleton looks like he is doing a bend back.

I have to agree that the new Lord Sam Sinister looks like a combination between the old Sam Sinister and Baron Von Baron, But I think this one is by far the best looking for detail. Hook hand, detailed shirt, monocle and top hat really do it in this set.

Overall its a fun set and due to the two mini-figs really ups the playability. Aesthetically its not much but that really cant be helped. I feel this model is a 6/10 and is a must for your adventure or orient expedition set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"smiley905","2007-12-29T19:22:07.06Z","pretty good","this set is good, i got it at the dentists for free, because i got a tooth pulled (although, it wasnt worth it.) and i put ti together on the way home, its pretty cool, the sam dude is alll right cool hat though, the skeliton is ok and and it pops up well. it comes with two jewls which is good, and i like the flags. this is a good set, im not sure what it costs but it cant be too much, and is probably worth it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2010-09-07T22:54:56.85Z","Scary Skeleton Spooks Sam Sinister (Try saying that five times fast)!","<p>Ahhh.... Orient Expedition. The theme brings back memories. Indiana Jones wannabes, classic monocle-wearing mustachioed bad guys, giant monsters, and jewels galore. What's not to like?</p>
<p><b>Building Experience</b>: A nice short build for an &quot;impulse set&quot;. Any builder should be able to complete this.</p>
<p><b>Parts</b>: This set features some really nice parts for an impulse. The tomb is made of nice snow color complemented by rocks. The light orange gives the set a nice touch. The Nepalese-type shrine on the top of the crypt is a really nice addition. This set features two minifigs, the evil Lord Sam Sinister and a classic &quot;old-school&quot; skeleton. This a cheap and easy way to get the main antagonist of the Adventurers and a good way to boost your population of classic skeletons (in my opinion, the old ones were better).</p>
<p><b>Playability</b>: I'm a little iffy on this. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The point is, when the tomb is closed, simply pull the knob on the front to release the jewel-brandishing skeleton. On several occasions, the skeleton falls off and gets stuck.</p>
<p><b>Value for Money</b>: At four dollars back in the day, this set was a great little pack. It can be found easily on the internet for less.</p>
<p><b>Final words</b>: This is a set that no fan of LEGO should be without. It's a good introduction to Johnny Thunder's World.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"Novelty","2008-02-14T02:45:43.233Z","Cut to the bone","The concept behind this set is nice - a concealed skeleton which, when the knob at the side is turned, flies into life to scare the unwary traveller.  This is the stuff of which haunted mansion theme-park rides are made of.

The concept works in this theme, and it works well, considering the small size of this set.  The building is quick and easy, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to trigger the skeleton.  However, the set lacks the WOW factor to make it stand out - the coffin thing is functional, but boring - nothing printed on the bricks, no embellisment, not even a scorpion or spider as an acessory.  The only thing that gives it colour is the yellow flag and the design on the lid of the &quot;coffin&quot;.  This is great for play, especially the first few times, but not for display.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-20T14:51:29.263Z","Tomb Raider!","I like the overall concept of this set and think it is swell! However it is missing something to make it a five. I mean the skeleton is a plus and so are the 3 gems! The little suprise tomb is okay but a tad lacking. I think a extension like a arch connected on the side would give it an interesting aproach! However lego doesn't read minds! So basically I rate this set a 7.5/10 simply because the skeletons can attack sam and the 3 jewels. Otherwise another set with a sam sinister! I reccomend getting this set for about 3 dollars at the most.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-26T14:48:50.903Z","BOO!","This is a very neat little set that consists of a tomb, a skeleton, two jewels, and Sam Sinister. This is an EXCELLENT and cheap way to get Sam Sinister. The tomb has a little lever on the side that, when flipped, causes the skeleton to pop out. You have to do this at just the right speed or else the skeleton gets stuck and Sam just walks by. This set has some neat pieces including the skeleton, the jewels, the flags, and of course, SAM! 
The premise of this set is the following: Presented for your consideration, Sam is walking through the snow on Mt. Everest when BOO!... the skeleton jumps out at him holding the jewels. Sam grabs the jewels and runs like heck with the skeleton chasing him. I don't know what happens next, maybe Sam falls off a cliff and to his death, quickly becoming a skeleton himself. That's when we hear the famous Rod Serling (yes, that was his name) voiceover from &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; explaining that the skeleton in the first place was a future version of Sam and that Sam is trapped in a very odd, unnatural experience known as a time loop. A very odd experience for us, but as common as a sunrise in... The Twilight Zone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
