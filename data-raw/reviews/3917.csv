"Captain","2008-09-29T19:59:56.687Z","Great set with nice parts and an alligator!","I bought this years ago on sale at Toys R Us for about 4 dollars. The original price was about 8, I think. The set is great. You get a cool little steamboat, I think some dynamite plates, two pistols, a rifle, a chain, a shovel, and a pickaxe. You also get a cool new Johnny Thunder and an alligator. I had always wanted one, and then they included it in an affordable set. You also get a sweet shrine with jewels and some squiggly arm pieces and a fancy headdress.

Overall, this was a great value for the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cactus","2009-07-25T13:34:12.03Z","""Let's explode some accessories!""","The Eligator is pretty cool, as the boat body, the dimonds and the chain. The snake is nice...
There's many useful minifig accessories, as the rifile,the hack and the box...
Even the plot is good... so wat is the problems?

1. I can't under stand why to take the accessories, put it in wooden box, tie it to chain, put on it dynamit sticks and put it on the board?...
2. Why to build windows if it blocked by the tanks?...

answers please...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This was the first Orient Expedition set I got, and for some reason, I even got two. The set has Johnny Thunder travelling into the heart of darkness in a small steam-driven boat. In addition to the boat there's a crocodile and a small shrine. Even though the set was small, the playability was great, the adventures Johnny could get into with this little boat... Ah, good times!</p>
<p>Moving on, this set was not great just because of the possibilities it offered my imagination, the accessories were all really great as well, in this small set you got: A crocodile, which I had wanted for a LONG time. Tribal headgear, a nice assortment of jewels, various&nbsp;gear and a larger steering wheel I had never seen before.&nbsp;A lot&nbsp;of the steam-engine pieces were used for 7415-Aero Nomade as well. All in all, this was one of the best Orient Expedition sets, despite it's size, I had a lot of fun with it, as a stand-alone set and as part of the Indian-subtheme. As this was the set that got me into Orient Expedition, the non-license theme I've loved the most, I'd say it's been one of the most important LEGO-sets&nbsp;to me.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
