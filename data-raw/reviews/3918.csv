"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-02T06:50:12Z","GREAT STUFF!!!!","This is a neat little set. The mechanism that collapses the floor is exactly the same as the temple of gloom, and works rather well. I actually like the figs in this set, well, I am a kid. The scimitars are nice but grey ones would be preferred. Tygurah can hold them as well, andcan use them to hack down Dr. Kilroy(you know you want to).
A great set, all in all.

By the way, the 2x1 brown piece with the hole on the side that appears to have no use is used to build the alternative model shown on the back of the instructions.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T04:11:09Z","Cool and clever","This is a useful brick set. You would probably use the groove bricks a lot. The magnifying glass is cool (well my one had a bit of paint missing on it) and the swords are a good accessory. The problem with this set is that the arch is very weak. But it's a good set nevertheless.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-07-18T07:16:13.747Z","Great Value and Tons of Fun!","Tygurah's roar is an extremely fun little set, which includes many excellent pieces and play features for the price. The layout and design of the set is suitably oriental and mysterious. the printing on Tygurah and the special arch piece is not that bad either. Dr. Kilroy also comes along with a rare magnifying glass. I am quite surprised that so much can be fitted on to the rather small baseplate, so in all this is quite a satisfying set. My only gripe is that Tygurah is perhaps a tad too cartoonish to be genuinely frightening, and is the worst-molded of the three creatures in the Orient Expedition line.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T01:57:01.06Z","The Adventures are into again - now in the Orient","This set is alot of fun to play with oh no I'm falling threw the bridge - run her comes the tiger. Lots of unusual pieces in this set, ladder, flat brown pieces, Tygurah,magnify glass,yellow swords. Since I have many of the Adventurer Sets this one was a no brainer to obtain. I like it and give it a 4.3 rounded down to a solid 4. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Novelty","2008-02-14T06:06:48.653Z","Catch a tiger by the toe","This set is part of the &quot;Indian&quot; subtheme of the Orient Expedition, although it is not marked as such.  Play-wise, it's great - the idea of the falling bridge is new and has never been done by lego before.  The huge Tygurah chasing the explorer is funny and fun, and there's even a snake thrown in for the fun of it. Design-wise, it is interesting.  The special painted bricks below the skull, the swords besides the arch, the torches and the palm leaves all lend an air of mystique to the set.  What this set fails is concept wise - there is nothing wrong with the falling bridge in itself, but a bridge connects two places.  Where are those 2 places?  It is not provided by this set nor by any other sets in the series.  In fact, the arch at the &quot;back&quot; leads to nowhere (and there's a drop after the arch).  It would have been nice if this set was modular and it tied into something else on both sides of the bridge.  Sadly this was not done.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-03T17:46:41.78Z","Small set with great value and some features","This small set was one of the orient expedition theme (or adventurers, orient expedition subtheme) and was released in 2003. This set is basic and have useful pieces, some features on building and also a good color scheme. The minifigure included is the &quot;Dr. Kilroy&quot;, too included in other adventurers or orient expedition sets. The set also includes another minifigure, not exactly in lego original scale, the &quot;Tygurah&quot;, that is also simple but good designed, altough don't moves well. The few building involved makes it better, due to features like the floor, that can be pushed to the things above fall in a green plate with some snake minifigures. Above the plate, there are some pieces making pilars. Above them, there is a gate with some pieces increasing it, pieces like the green leafs, to makes it looks like more a forest, and also, above the gate, there are some torchs and a skull. Altough the set is so much small and the playability is not the better (it is due to the size), this was a cheap option to have some useful pieces and a good builted small.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-12-27T13:30:58.793Z","Verrryyy interesting...","My younger bro got this for Christmas several years ago, but I was the one who played with it more often.

Pros:
Doc Kilroy in jungle gear
giant bipedal tiger
collapsing bridge is fun
yellow scimitars
interesting printed archway

Cons:
HA! That's a good one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-21T11:57:40.397Z","LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) - Tygurah's Roar Review","Now this is one set which is going to be hard to find in the future. It comes with a big tygurah creature who looks a little bit like a tiger. The set is very easy to build and very sturdy. You also don't have to worry about stickers. I love the way how LEGO did the floor which you can disappear if you slide the platform away. The set also comes with two yellow swords and a skull on the top of that little building. The minifig we get in this set is called Dr. Kilroy and he comes with his white suit and his green vest.<br><br>I love this set and I also like the ideas which you can build with the pieces of this set. I really miss the Adventurers theme and the Johnny Thunder characters and I hope they'll return one day.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
