"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-19T00:00:00Z","","I like the way pulling open the drawer opens the Yeti's cave. I agree the Yeti is the best of the bigfigs. I also love the shrine and the new shirpa hats. The woman's name is Miss Pippin Reed. (I said Read in another review of another OE set I believe, but Reed is right.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-02T22:35:26Z","YETI!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I love the himalaya sets, especially this one. it has a green gem, himalayan reed(the only set with one), and a yeti. get the temple and make the yeti guard the sword. Overall, a great set, 

P.S. I forgot to mention the cool cave door",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-06T17:07:28Z","Great little set!!","I got this for Xmas (along with temple of mount everest) and I loved it!  It has got pieces: Ice pick, Camera, Pippin in Tibet clothes, Yeti, mountain piece, green gem, icicles, and roof pieces.  I think this is the best of the bigfig Orient Expedition sets.   This set has more pieces than the other two, and the Yeti looks better than Tygurah and Jun-Chi.  The trap is great too, when Pippin opens the drawer to get the gem, the cave of the Yeti opens!  It works really well!  Overall this set is really worth it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-02T06:23:36Z","a bit dissapointing","This set is too small and the yeti's cave isnt even a cave! There is also a weird lamp thing and the set has a pretty bad mechanism which breaks easily. Although is does go well with the Temple at Mount Everest set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-28T21:58:02Z","Cool!","I really like this set i have all the everest OE sets and this is one of my favorites. i has got some good pieces and is over all a good set (to the first guy who reviewed this set, that thing is not a lamp, it is a special statue sort of thing that Tibetens put over things called Chortens)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T12:04:35Z","good economy-level set","I got this set for half price and it's well worth it, for the variety of pieces. It looks like a good piece in the Johnny Thunder line, and I'll agree with the basic consensus that the Yeti is the best bigfig and that the cave door breaks too easily (the cave door by itself is a great piece that I found lots of uses for). I bought the set primarily for a star wars tie-in, since the two icicles are really lightsaber blades and the yeti is the perfect Lego equivalent of the ice monster Luke fights in Empire Strikes Back. I'm also convinced that in brown it would make the perfect Rancor monster for the Jabba's Palace set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-04T16:01:10Z","the yeti is funny","this is a good set. it would be a good add-on to the everest temple thingy(i wish i had it). the only problem is tha there is only one person. its fun to make ms. pippin reed kick the yeti's butt with the maces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-05T14:06:59Z","This set could be better.......","This is a good set overall but, it could of been a real big set and they could of did alot more with it. The swing open door is a nice gimmick but another minifig would be nice.The Yeti is wicked i love him. I myself got it for 4 USD so i couldn't leave it there.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-14T02:51:56.967Z","Getti Yeti","Aladin has his secret cave.  This set takes that concept by having a yeti hide inside the mountainside, accessible by a door made of ice.  What's nice about the sets is the details included - the icicles on the door made out of light transparent rods is interesting.  The design and look of the shrine is also nicely done with a great tan/brown/black colour scheme.  What's not nice though is the gaps between the &quot;door&quot; and the &quot;frame&quot; - a better design could have eliminated those gaps.  Still, that doesn't detract from the rest of the set and this is among one of the better larger small sets of the Orient Expedition.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-07-07T23:51:48.013Z","Yeti set is good fun - Very cool","This set is affordable and alot of fun for the money. The Yeti is unique, I have never seen it or anything quite like it in any other LEGO set. I like the special way the door opens to reveal the Yeti. The mini figure is good and she is a girl ! The hat is wierd but fitting considering where the scene should take place. Overall a great set, if you are into the Adventure series like myself it is a must have for your collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-29T12:03:02.187Z","Wish I still had this:(","I used to have this set when I was younger, but it's gone now. And I mean GONE. Kaputski. Fin. I'll never find it again.:( I got this set the same Christmas that my brothers got Tygurah's Roar and The Passage of Jun-chi. I had so much fun having Pippin discover the jewels, only to pull them out and activate the secret door, revealing the Yeti. He would try to get her with those two clubs on the wall, but she was too smart for him every time and it turned out to be a robot made by Sam Sinister. (Look, I was 6, alright?) This set came with many good pieces including the clubs, the camera, Pippin's hat, the flags, the transluscent blue sticks that acted as icicles, and the jewels. Too bad I got rid of it, I just wasn't in my right mind that day is all. That's also when I got rid of all my Harry Potter sets. Oh well, I'll just have to scour ebay, bricklink, and local garage sales until I find this again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J0rgen","2010-11-27T10:29:08.317Z","Yeti's Hideout: A retrospective look at set 7412","What the point of this review is, is a good question. The set came out nearly eight years ago and can only be found on eBay and sites of it's kind. Still, I want to share my thoughts on this set, because it was one of my favourites out of all the Orient Expedition sets, back in the day.<br/>I got this set at the time of it's release, back then, my interest in Lego was mainly playing with them, now I just display them in a room in my basement. When I'm now writing this the set is in pieces, I've tried to re-construct it, but it's a work in progress. However, I don't need to have the set in front of me to review it, it wasn't a very large set. It consisted only of these elements: A small shrine of sorts, with a drawer you could open to reveal an emerald. When you opening the drawer, a small mechanism would pull&nbsp;the door open, and the yeti would be revealed. The yeti had the same type of body as the other monsters in Orient Expedition, Tygurah and Jun-Chi, one leg-brick, and two arms, moving independently of each other. This body you would have to build up, over this you would put the yeti's ""skin"", a big piece, kind of like the classic ghost brick. It's hard to describe the looks of it, but you can see it in the picture above.<br/>The set was not very big and you wouldn't think there&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;playability, well, there was. I think it was mainly because the yeti was a great figure, the trap within the shrine was a very amusing feature and I could play this over and over again. It worked great as a stand-alone set, but that didn't mean you couldn't put it into the big picture, combining it with 7417 Temple of Mount Everest or 7415 Aero Nomade. The yeti would work as a main antagonist along with Lord Sinister in the Himalayas, I also remember using it as the wampa from The Empire Strikes Back, all in all, a set that was great because of it's simplicity and great figures.",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"ledaKat","2009-10-23T04:26:51.967Z","The Yeti Does Exist!","This set has all the intricate design elements and lavish beauty of a much larger set, all shrunk down onto a little 8 by 16 stud baseplate. It makes for a great, well structured and portable playset that is full of creative fun.

The minifigs are excellent. Pippin Reed in this outfit is my favourite ""human"" minifig that I have. I adore her hat and her face is really pretty. And the yeti is just supurb (even though he is not strictly a minifig I really think he should be cos he's cool.) 

This small set is lovely to build and looks really wonderful. I love the small aqua icicles they really add an aesthetic beauty to the overall composition of the set.

It has an open the draw with the jewel in it and the Yeti's cave door opens system that works really well. Pippin has a sweet little camera, a fab hat and I cannot stress enough that the yeti is just cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-13T11:28:12.97Z","LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) - Yeti's Hideout Review","I remember this set is my first set of the LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) theme which I got. I really enjoy building this set and it comes with Miss Pippin Reed in parka and it also comes with an awsome yeti creature. This model is an easy built and it's very sturdy too. I also don't have to complain about stickers. The cave does open if you want to take out the hidden gem and the mountain piece looks very nice. The little tower where the gem is hidden looks really nice too. All in all I can't really complain about this set. Even if this set doesn't have much play features it's still a cool little set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a cool set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
