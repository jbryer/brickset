"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-02T00:00:00Z","","I just got one, and Jun-Chi is really detailed. I gave him two katanas instead (of two pikes), so I could use the pikes for a combiantion of two 7416s. (That I am planning on making.) Some good red and tan pieces. If you get this, and a Dragon Fortress, then you could make a gate out of this, just removing the the turntable, and leaving Jun-Chi to stand there with his pikes (or katanas, or whatever weapons you give him.), or leaving the whole set, and having a revolving door in front of the stairs to the Fortress.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"skyscraper","2007-12-26T17:03:19.013Z","Not a good set ","The only thing i like about is the nice frame thing but everythings else is just kinda off. It also cost 10 US dollars so I didnt really like that part either. THe playbility is very low you cant really have much fun with it . It should have came with some more minifigures at the same price.And the revolving part should fill up the space between but it doesnt so that doesnt make it look as good either.

"Novelty","2008-02-14T10:00:28.31Z","What's behind Wall number 1?","Scooby Doo cartoons perhaps made famous the rotating wall with the monster hidden behind it.  That's the concept of this set, complete with the rotating section of the wall.  The arch that the wall is supposed to represent is nicely decked out in red and tan and decorated with lanterns and flags to give it a very nice oriental look.  It is easy to build and is pleasing to the eye.

What this set fails though is the actual rotating wall itself because the rotating wall is recessed into the back and gaps can be seen between the arch and the rotating wall.  A better redesign would probably have eliminated the gap and yet allowed the wall to turn.  Also, the &quot;stand alone&quot; nature of the theme means that this wall is disjointed - it stands in the middle of nowhere and is connected to nothing, and that detracts from it.

Still this good-looking set has great play value for the first couple of times or so.  ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Good:
Chinese Decoration
Johnny Thunder
Red Jewel
Rifle
Red Yeti or Dragon???

Great pieces to build those lights -seriously- those round canisters are hard to get.

Bad:
Nothing.

A tiny set to add to your collection.

"Jim_Java","2008-08-04T12:02:51.31Z","A Nice LITTLE Set","The Chinese portion of the OE theme contains less sets than all the others. This one is also smaller than the Tibet and India &quot;Beast&quot; sets (The Yeti and Tygurrah). In those sets, you got additional gimmicks besides the monster in hiding-for example, the &quot;trap&quot; the Tygurrah could fall into. This one doesn't have that. However, it is pretty detailed. You get the red flaps with Orient symbols, and the red and gold lamps (a nice touch, although they have a tendency to fall off).  You also get Jun-Chi, who appears to bet some kind mutated Chinese Dragon. And it's a pretty easy-to build set. If you see this on clearance (assuming stores are still carrying it!), or at 5Below, go ahead and get, particularly if you (as with me) are set on collecting practically every one of these sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"ledaKat","2009-10-30T20:03:05.357Z","Beautiful Colours","I really like this little set.  Its colours are just lovely. That deep red, black, sand and a hint of green create quite a tastey show piece when its put on display. The designers have really captured the essence of the orient here.  I think the big red beasty is cute, and the turntable he stands on is a nice idea. I also like how it has a large back section to the set, and because the beast turns and the plinth with the gem is on the otherside, you can use either side of the set equally and not loose the visuals.  I have too many Johnny Thunder figs though, would like to see another Pippin Reid in a new, exclusive outfit like in the Yeti set.

A nice addition to your Adventurers collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Joe178","2010-10-02T04:59:14.193Z"," Gateway to the Dragon Fortress!","Got this set in 2008. Its really good value. Jun-Chi was really cool to build. It's a bit of a shame that all the monsters are the same build. It's got really cool pieces and I do think its worth £10 but I got it for £5. I used to play with it alot but now it's in pieces. It's got a really cool passage-way with a red crystal and it turns round and Jun-Chi is on the other side. Its got really cool lanterns at the side but I think it should have more of a passage-way. But it's really good to make your own passage-way. I think why it turned out to be in pieces is because I have so many sets - I've been collecting ever since I was 5 in 2008.",FALSE,4,5,5,3,4
"Ernst","2012-03-05T15:37:28.29Z","Passage of Jun-Chi, Johnny versus the Red Yeti.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : I got this set in a deal with 7 Adventurers sets and made this one as first because of the&nbsp;inviting Red color setting.&nbsp;The theme is&nbsp;in my opinion&nbsp;an early version of the Indiana Jones theme. A nice set that probably is the entrance to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7419-1"">the main set</a> of this theme. This one is great to own, looks wonderfull, has great parts and is affordable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks : You start with a base of tiles and a turntable&nbsp;on which you make the platform. Then a wall that divides the Yeti and the Daimond Treasure, left and right two small walls with pillars and a bow above it. On both sides black slopes, spears, banners and lights in front and a small gate with cones on top. On the rear side 2 torches to light the Daimond. A very nice, colourfull looking result with 2 nice minifigures which is fun to built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : Very nice parts in this set : the brick colors used are great (red, tan and sand green). Other good parts are the trans yellow minifigure heads, torches, spears, the small red fence and of course the Johnny Thunder figure and the Red Yeti. One flaw is that the legs and arms of the Yeti can't move. A good remark for the instructions that shows a&nbsp;story you can play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : although it looks great not much choice, Johnny defeats the Yeti and takes the treasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : the average price on Bricklink shows €6,25 which is a good price for a great looking set like this with all the nice parts it has. If you can get it for less I defenitly advise to buy it, a good deal.</p>

"Jack_Sassy","2022-01-20T16:11:19.497Z","A lovely set","<p>After several years of Adventurers theme&#39;s&nbsp;absence, Johnny Thunder and his friends returned in 2003 with the all new Orient Expedition. As always, it had a well-constructed story, chasing after Marco Polo&#39;s treasure throughout the orient. 7413 Passage of Jun-Chi might not be the set that most recognise but surely holds up to the rest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first glance it might not seem like much, all you get is Johnny Thunder (again) and Jun-Chi. While Adventurers theme did suffer from too many Johnny Thunders in small sets, this one is still a pleasing addition (due to an update to his face), I won&#39;t deny that Pippin or Doctor Lightning would have been better. Jun-Chi is quite a bulky figure but a useful one nonetheless. There was a similar figure as a tiger in different set&nbsp;which, to be honest, didn&#39;t work very well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build itself is very pleasing, you get a facade of what looks to be a Chinese temple entrance (or a passage for that matter) with enough space to pose given figures. Mostly big parts (as would be expected at the time) and a 8x16 grey baseplate.&nbsp;There is a turntable with Jun-Chi on one side and a crystal on the other. I am not sure how this scene can fit in with the rest of the adventure, one thing I think would be nice to see is this passage combined with Dragon Fortress.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I bought this set used, it isn&#39;t as mint as one would expect, but buyer was kind enough to provide me with two sealed and two opened cards from the set. As I understand, these cards were used back in 2003 to accompany the board game that was released along with the sets. A nice feature, if you ask me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To end this short review, I would like to say that while this set makes little sense, it is a nice addition to all the adventures that one could come up with. Jun-Chi is surprisingly good (despite it being more of a big block&nbsp;than a creature) and build itself could be used for many orient scenarios. I shall leave 4 stars, just like the main rating is.</p>
