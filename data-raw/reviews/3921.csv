"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-19T00:00:00Z","","I really like this set. Great detail, great playability. The Orient Expedition theme is pretty good, not quite comparable at the best with the old Space, Castle, and Pirates sets, but quite a lot better than just about every thing TLC is making these days, except for the Legends, of which there should be many more. Rob J, all the minifigs in this set are new, two of which aren't found in any other sets (Babloo, the Guy atop the elephant, and the archeologist, who has a new face and torso.) But the the man in black (Lord Sinister, a re-done version of Sam from the Egypt and Dino Island sets), and Miss Pippin read are both quite similiar to others. Miss Read to her older self from the Amazon, and Lord Sinister to Slyboots, his assistant only in the Egypt sets, but in quite alot of them. Comes with 5 O.E. game cards.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-27T13:49:25Z","GREAT!!","This set is Great! it is a great adition to any Johnny Thunder collection. The pieces are also good, it comes with one of those LEGO turbans and as far as i no is 1 of 2 sets that carries an elephant! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-31T09:17:00Z","!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Great set, excellent 'figs and perfect chase car and elephant. What more do you need? Great playability, especially with the elephant. The best animal ever created by lego included in this set, complete with small howdah, crew and carrage!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-17T19:39:20Z","What's so good about this set?","...it's good but all tens? There's an alarming lack of pieces. It's nice to get another car, Babloo, the cool thing behind the elephant, a dark grey elephant (adds variety and is more realistic), and a good variety of weapons/tools. This goes well with scorpion palace and the coolest thing about orient expedition was that you could have all four sets from the mini-theme (India, Nepal, or China) in a small small (except China because Dragon Fortress is huge.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-05T16:56:59Z","No fun at all!!!!","This set is no fun at all.  What's up with an elephant pulling a cart.  Totally unrealistic.  The turban man is totally weird.  He carries a cool sword and a whip.  I didn't like this set because it was boring.  I had no say in if I wanted it or not.  I got it as a birthday present and they forced me to open it and build it before they left.  When I first saw this set I knew I was never going to get it but I was totally wrong.  I hate it.  Personally I had more fun taking it apart and building it into something else.  Anyways, the only reason I give it 4 points is for the elephant.  It's the only awesome thing in the set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-17T11:04:29.93Z","Hello Mr. Elephant!","It's a good set, I got it half price! 
I would never buy it at full price, it's to steep.
That's probably because of the elephant.

Cool jeep, and elephant, cart is so-so

"Novelty","2008-02-14T10:09:33.28Z","Sound the Trumpets!","There's two vehicles in this set, a conventional automobile and an Elephant pulled chariot.  The former is plain and standard for the theme, the latter is extravagant and unique to the Orient Expedition.  The automobile is almost shadowed by the elephant chariot and rightly so, but the inclusion of it gives the set a bit more play value - i.e. which is faster, the automobile or the elephant?

This set looks interesting, thanks to the elephant.  The clever recycling of dinosaur parts to form the elephant is interesting.  The clever use of cloth to provide the saddle for the elephant is also interesting.  Attaching a chariot to the elephant has never been done by Lego before.  All this makes a very interesting elephant chariot.  However, the chariot is attached to the elephant at a rather odd place which causes it to slant rather dangerously, as the wheels are not as tall as the legs of the elephant.  The resulting chariot, in play, is unwieldy and is easily broken.

Overall, the set looks interesting, but does not survive rough play.  This seems to be designed as a display set rather than an action set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T02:02:18.013Z","Elephant in Lego Land","The elephant is cool piece to have, definetly alot of fun to play if you have other Adventure's sets to add to it, you can really act out some scenes. My kids and I love the Adventure's theme and have many sets of them. This is one of our favorites.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-07T14:03:52.95Z","Elephant Chase!","This set is AWESOME and worth the money I paid for it, 3.00! I found this set in 2004 at a walmart along with many other sets for only 3.00! It yeilds much playibility and has a dark gray lego elephant which is a very nice touch! I includes another indian guy which I mainly use as a bad guy. Sams car is a little to small but it comes with 2 dynamite which is a plus. The cart is okay and comes with ms. reed and tools.

pros: elephant

rare minifigs

dynamite made a comeback

whip and sword

wheels on wagon cart

tools

whole set

cons: none!

Overall it's great and is a good set to buy. On brickset I would reccomned getting it for about 10-20 dollars but nothin higher.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J0rgen","2010-11-29T10:51:03.313Z","Elephant Caravan: A retrospective look at set 7414","Another ""pointless"" review of a set that disappeared from the shelves many years ago. Like the previously reviewed set 7412-Yeti's Hideout, this set&nbsp;includes the female&nbsp;reporter Pippin, she didn't appear in many sets, in fact this and the previously mentioned Yeti's Hideout were the only ones where she appeared as the&nbsp;main protagonist. She was included in 7419-Dragon Fortress as well. In this set we also find the main antagonist of the theme, Lord Sinister and the exclusive Babloo, Babloo provided a new turban colour, red.&nbsp;As far as I know there hasn't been any red turbans since, so it was a real treat.<br/>This set was another favourite of mine at the time, the reason? The elephant. Yes, there was another set with an elephant, 7418-Scorpion Palace, but I didn't get the money to aquire that before much later. The elephant is made out of elements from the Dinosaur-theme released a couple of years earlier, the only new elements were the tip of the trunk and the head. Anyway, I loved it! Having Sinister chasing after Pippin, Babloo and the elephant throwing dynamite, like depicted in the cartoon or having Babloo lead a riot against the evil Maharaja and his henchman. The latter was, of course, at a later point, as I've previously mentioned I did not get the Scorpion Palace before some time later.<br/>All in all, it was a good set, and it gave me a lot of fun. The inclusion of two enemy vehicles made for a lot of playability, unlike sets like 7410-Jungle River or 7416-Emperor's Ship. The elephant was one of the better LEGO animals, as it, unlike horses or hippogriffs, was able to move several parts of it's body: Trunk, neck, tail and legs. I notice I haven't mentioned Sinister's car yet, that's because it was pretty standard, a good car, but nothing special.",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Future_afol","2020-12-28T13:21:27.297Z","Amazing ","<p>How can I describe it other than amazing.</p>

<p>The elephant is such a great molded&nbsp;piece for 2003 and still holds up Lego&#39;s standards today. The blanket is printed amazingly with great detail and the minifigures are great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent &pound;120 on this and yes it was worth it. It was so good I had to buy Tygurahs Roar and The Passage Of Jun Chi and I am still looking for more orient expedition sets because they are all so good. The next ones I am trying to get are Scorpion Palace and Yetis hideout</p>
