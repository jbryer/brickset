"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-31T15:48:23Z","Not great, but still pretty good","This set is okay and has some unique (and resusible) pieces.  But is kind of simple for the price of $20.  I got for half price so it was a much better value.  And although the balloon has been done before, I think it only came with the big, expensive sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-14T11:07:58.903Z","Full of hot air","This set contains a hot air balloon, 2 minifigures and a box of tools - the latter is the norm for most Adventurers sets.  The concept is an interesting one - this set is an updated dragon powered machine from Fright Knights with burners and a balloon instead of a dragon... and it looks good.

Although the balloon is not a perfect sphere, the clever use of the string net on top and the rubber bands give it a texture that is visually appealing.  The structure of the burner that is suspended from the balloon, complete with flames, is interesting.  The gondolla, with circular fences and a gas bottle, all attached to the balloon by pirate netting looks good.  There's even a winch to tug along the ubiquitous box of tools.

Where it fails though is that the set is flimsy and it breaks apart easily, particularly at the joints between the ladder piece which is connected to the gondola and the pirate netting which is connected to the balloon.  Again, this has the look of a great display set, but fails as a play set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-25T17:42:12.437Z","Adventurers on the sky!","This is a set from the orient expedition subtheme from the theme of adventurers. This is one scene on the story of the subtheme, and include trading cards, included too in other sets from the subtheme, don't any plate or dice, due to don't be one of the bigger sets. The minifigure of Dr. Kilroy(and his card) and of Johnny Thunder are included. 
 The balloon consists in two great parts, trough that is putted a technic piece, and two fire lego pieces. The rails, by claw pieces are connected by the great part above and the under part, where can be putted the minifigures. A big propeller is too putted by the claw pieces, at a rail on it's back, don't frustrating the part under that, where placed a cord with a hook to hang the box of tools. The spherical part(don't very spherical, but still in a good shape) is connected with elastics to a net, and the other side of these are placed in the part with fire pieces. The bottle is placed where can be putted the minifigures, this is cool because isn't only one piece. The rails on the under parts keeps the minifigure inside the building, and this is keeped with plates under and have too pile like pieces on the sides. This set have more contents than the set from fright knights named &quot;Witch's Windship&quot;, but have the same playability due to the set idea. 
 I saw this set complete and i played with it, don't had any problem with playability, also little childrens can play with that, altough the rails keep the minifigures inside the set, these keeps a space to makes the minifgure be played. Rails, the tool box, the minifigures, are very useful, can be used as stairs, weapons, and the minifigures to make cities. To a set in this size, this deserves a 5/5 rate...  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"18000pieces","2009-08-05T16:28:17Z","Balloon!","I love this set. What the Adventurers sets really were was action setpieces, for playing out the most awesome, Indiana-Jones-esque action scenes you can think of, and this one succeeded wonderfully for that purpose. A perilous postion high above the unforgiving peaks of the Himilayas, with a canister of explosive gas on board, a winch and box hanging far below for someone to maybe hang onto after falling off, along with a gondola attached by easy-to-break ropes to the balloon, and Sam Sinister's biplane only a seven dollars and a trip to the store away?

Creating utterly outrageous and highly suspensful action scenes with this set ate up several hours of my younger self's time, and it was time well spent. I recently dug it out and broke it up to create steampunk MOC's, which it is really handy for, since LEGO doesn't often creat balloons.

PROS
-those mentioned above
-even though it only has 120 pieces, this set is very large.
-works with Sinister's biplane
-good pieces of MOC'ing.

CONS
-after several years sitting at the back of my humid shelf, the rubber bands had formed a binding to the balloon, and I had to peel them off. They were no good any more, and I had to get rid of them and replace them with slightly larger rubber bands, which didn't have the same elasticity and pulled a bit too hard, making the net off-balance. But that's a very specific concern.
-It is kind of fragile, but that works. Real weather balloons are kind of fragile.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I would really give this a 0/5 or 0/10
