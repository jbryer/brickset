The colour scheme is nice and would look nice along side the fortress. I have deducted marks because of it's small size and the fact that I'm not a fan of boats and ships. This aside, it looks like a must have for any Lego collector. :p",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-05T00:00:00Z","","Well, I recieved two, from different sources, and as I grew tired of trying to wait a full week before opening all my LEGO birthday presents I ripped both... Well, you don't need to hear all the details. But anyways, I built a large ship out of both sets, which was about 50 studs long, and ten studs hidg at the highest part not including the masts. It has a cargo hold which a minifig has space to crawl around in, and ACCESS to all parts of the itself (""Access to all parts of itself, now that sounds stupid""), unlike the cover model. No, it doesn't come with Johnny, Johnny430, that is the cargo area. Johnny and the four barrels of cargo containing EIGHT jewels all together (four differnet colors, red, dark blue, dark green, and yellow, pretty obviosly, two of each), couldn't all fit in the cargo hold of the ship you see here. Well, if you made it real uncomftorable for Johnny, he might fit. Works well with the Ninja line. It only comes with two Chinese flags, though, and I mean the decorated kind, with the litle gold and black symbol (I really wanted more). I also had a few pieces left over to make a little three man boat, for my Wolfpack guys I acquired with out purchasing any of Wolfpack sets. I really recommend getting two, and three would be awesome!!!!!!!!!! (But expensive!)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-25T00:00:00Z","","This is a good a good set, one of the best transportation sets out of all three subthemes. A cheaper way to get your own chinese guards rather than The Dragon Fortress, because i'm definately getting this set. I love the decorations, especially the sails. While I don't have this set I just wonder what the comic that comes with it will be like, I wonder the same thing with The Aero Nomad. Lord Sinister seems to appear in quite alot of the Orient Expedition sets, he suits the set well seeing as it's a villain set, but what I don't understand is why you don't get The Emperor with it, and it's named Emperors Ship. Well you seem to only get Lord Sinister's subtheme henchman with the big sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-26T13:54:21Z","Nice ship","The guards are nice, they can become waiters in a chinese restaurant for your miniland/world city. The flag is good, I have now 5 of it (2 jun-chi's)The boat it self is a nice design with lower deck and 2 barrels with jewels. Only the lord sinistre fig is not really neccessairy. (I have already 10 of him I think) The chinese girl or the emperor were a better addition. even an extra guard.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legozander","2007-04-03T07:09:47.46Z","Superb. :)","I really like old sets like this one. This is really a great set. The ship has a good design and a cool cargo hold with two barrels with three diamonds in each. I really like the oars and sail peices they really complete the set. And the dragon on the sail is cool. :) The two chinese minifigs are very cool but I would have prefered a third one instead of lord sinister. Also you get two brown crossbow peices!  A truly fantastic set with interesting peices. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-15T02:51:28.59Z","Float on a river, forever and ever, Emily","This set shows how far ships and boats have come since the pitiful little castle ships and the large-piece pirates sailboats.  Unlike the former, it's spacious and wide.  Unlike the latter, its hull is built up of smaller pieces instead of a prefab hull piece.  The sum of the total is that this is a construction toy that feels and looks like one.

The boat itself is pretty basic - stack up the bricks and build it up.  What is interesting is the interesting use of colour - mainly red - to make the ship look pleasing.  There are also embellishments that sets this ship apart from others, from the dragon-head helm in the bow, to the lantern at the back and the use of red fences in between.  The most eye-catching feature is the sail, which is a normal pirate sail, but modified with what looks to be a lizard.

Overall, this is a nice solid ship that doesn't break apart during play, and looks well enough to be displayed.

"jinxjinx550","2009-12-20T13:35:27.543Z","Small Treasure","There are sets that you buy because you want to put them together, and there are sets you buy to display, and there are sets you buy because the parts are great.  This little set gives you all three for the same price, and it's totally worth it.

In addition to the unique dragon-pattern sail, the set offers relatively rare pieces, or pieces in unusual colors -- the long oars; the brown steering wheel; the red boat hull pieces; the tan trapdoor; the black windsurfer mast.  And the color plan is very effective, especially if you have other sets in the Orient Adventurers line like the Dragon Fortress (Set 7419).  Those colors accurately reflect the kind of materials that Western Europe loved to import from China like red lacquer, sandalwood, and bamboo.

Others have complained that if it's called the Emperor's Ship, it ought to have the Emperor as a passenger, but to me it suggests a pirate ship.  Once it might have belonged to the Emperor, but now pirates have taken it over, and they're prowling the South China Seas looking for more victims.

A great set for the price.  Adventurers collectors will be really happy with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2008-10-11T17:40:25.763Z","Could be better","It's a nice design, but nobody can go under the small deck. Only the barrels can.
Pros:
Sail and mast piece
Oars
Jewels(i don't have many green jewels)
Cons:
Too small
ANOTHER Sam Sinister
It's the Emperor's ship! Why for crying out loud doesn't it have the Emperor?
See you next review!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
