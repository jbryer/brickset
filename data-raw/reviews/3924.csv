"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-18T00:00:00Z","","The amazing features of this set have been mentioned, and all I feel I need to say about this set after those is IT'S GREAT!!! One other thing, if it is yellow, it isn't a ruby guys, it is a topaz. So maybe two other things. I really like that golden sword, and the nice crystalized/petrified wood tile.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T23:57:25Z","Ice &quot;boards&quot; and unique weapon! ","I have to admit buying this set just for the boardgame pieces! It is however much cheaper to buy them seperately than to pay for the rest of stuff in this set.

The golden sword, plane, and new cards for the orient boardgame make this an ok set, but the set just lacks an element of style.  There are so many juniorised and technic pieces that make up the set, and the set isn't good for alternate models.  The minifigs aren't so hot either.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-22T12:57:09Z","pretty good...","PROS: white baseplate, not versatile but very nice, the bi-plane is good and the figs are generally good. The &quot;traps&quot; themselves work well, the axe one in particular, and there is a good selection of roof tiles and the golden sword, well, is gold and very nice.
CONS: the actual temple has a lack of sides, this is particularly noticeable in the golden sword room. The figs now have the new &quot;creepy&quot;(in my opinion) eyes with white pupils.very nice, all in all.

PROS
The doors
-the black roof pieces
-the yet hunter and the sherpa
-johnny thunder and the baron/sam sinister's new look
-the accesories
-the bridge
-the golden sword
-the gem
-the axe trap
-the catapult
-the detailed driftwood piece
-the big white baseplate

CONS
-the building is too bit small
-the catapult has problems

The pros outwegigh the cons, so that's why I gave this set a 9.

The way I think they could have made it better would have been to take away the airplane and instead make the building bigger.  The airplane was good, but not really necessary.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-17T20:28:03Z","The best orient set?","..the orient theme was great but there was no great set from the whole 12 set theme. This was the closest one though. There were three mini-themes: India, Nepal (this one's Nepal), and China. Each theme had four sets. One small inexpensive one that wasn't really great. A small set with a simple trap and a monster, a medium treansport set, and a big &quot;final showdown set&quot; all of them have different prices, a gold weapon, adn both Johnny Thunder (hero), and Sam Sinister (villain). Thisi s the smallest and cheapest of the three big sets. It's also my favourite. It had the best traps (the bridge one never works though... it dindn't work on King kahuka's island either. There are three traps in this set: bridge, axes, catapult. There is a very cool gold sword hidden in a cave. The plane was nice to get too. I still don't like the board game.

Pros: 
cool pieces: 
sword, bridge, snowshoes, ice gear
best traps
doesn't take up to much space
relatively cheap
white baseplate
sherpas!
cool cave to hide the sword
decent amout of figs

cons:
cave could have been a bit better
small, nothing to it

overall: it's a great set. The biggest complaint of mine is the lack of stuff inside except for the one room and the cave. all three big sets have this problem but this has the best excuse. Buy it if you can. You won't regret it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-29T13:11:40Z","better than 7148","its better than the scorpian palace but it could have been a bit better. insted of having to clide the cave away yourself it should have had a mechanism. also the cattapult is crap. if it didn't have the plane it would have been &#163;5 cheaper. but it is still a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-29T09:11:31Z","buildings to small","this set has a really good blend of colours and some axes that've never seem before. the building is to small and the plane is pointless a plane couldn't fly at the top of mt.everst anyway. the minifigures look really good and the board game is the best one out of the 3. this is probably the secound best oe set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-08-31T06:31:20Z","A great way to top the whole thing off","This set is actually a lot better (plus times cheaper) than the &quot;super-big&quot; sets of the China and India sub-series, though they were definately  more impressive. Anyway, the structure is great; I was surprised so much could be fitted on to that baseplate. The traps and functions in this set trump everything else: the swinging axe thing just blew me away. As mentioned in another review, though, the bridge was horrid. I modified mine with smooth plates so it could fall off. As for minifigs, the detailing is awesome as ever, especially for Sangye Dorjei and the Nepalese hunter, who only appear here. The sword was amazing, but the paint fades fast. And the plane is an awesome vehicle (more reuseable than an elephant or all-terrain trekker). This may well be the best set of the series. Go grab it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-16T00:47:20.06Z","Ice Mountain","This is the largest set of the Himalayas sub-theme of the Orient Expedition sub-theme.  It is, however, noticably smaller than either the Indian or East Asian sets from the same year.  It consists of a bridge, a plane and a board game which can be played together with this set.

There's nothing much to write about the plane - it's a typical Adventurers bi-plane, but with good yellow highlights amongst the black, brown and grey.  It would have been better if the pieces in the plane was swapped out to make the building bigger and grander.

The main building is a raised shrine accessible only by a bridge.  The shrine itself is weird, with flames from skulls and a door to bar entry.  Nevertheless, it does have interesting features including the rather well designed roof.

The bridge is the action feature of the set.  It is connected to an axle which can be turned to simulate the bridge pitching.  That is an interesting feature that will probably simulate play.  What is weird is that the end of the bridge not connected to the shrine hangs in the air and is propped up by a BURP.  There's no stairs or path or ramp to it.  The whole arrangement looks rather bizzare.

This is a disappointing large set for the series, considering that the other 2 were relatively well done.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2007-12-25T12:37:40.653Z","boobie traps galore","To me this set looked great when I got it and has a lot of playibility. It is the prefect lego to put in a mountain setting.

pros: all the people

bi-plane

bridge

sword

boobie traps

the yellow gem

cons: temple too small

flinging floor trap is preatty hard to move

Overall it is great for only 30.00 and is a nice edition to anyone's collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-26T10:07:08.31Z","cool functions.","Nice little, big set. Cool baseplate and nice functions. Also abundant in minifigures and cool pieces. The plane has a nice engine and wings. The temple has a neat roof and treasure. Not much to say about this set. So here are the functions: When the temple doors open, axes swing down. If you pull a pin, the bridge collapses. Last,you can slide a glacier and the golden sword is revealed. 10 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-07T05:12:22.5Z","LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) - Temple of Mount Everest Review","This is a very exciting set from the LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) theme. It has lot's of play value and some cool minifigs. Two minifigs are exclusive to this set. The rare characters are Sherpa Sangye Dorje who comes with his cool brown hat piece and a big backpack. He also has gray pants and an orange pullover. The other exclusive minifig is the yeti hunter Ngan Pa. He comes with a rifle, a black hat, dark gray pants, a dark red pullover and a gray vest. This set also includes another Johnny Thunder minifig and a Lord Sam Sinister minifig. We also get a board game with some cards and a dice. The whole set is fun to build and to play with and we also don't get any stickers which you have to complain about.<br><br>The biplane is a very cool plane. We get a propeller which sviwels full 360Â° and two rifles on the top. The pilot fits in the cockpit very easily and I also like the colors which LEGO has chosen for this vehicle. The main attraction of this set is the temple. We get two places where you can store the snowshoes and we also get a mountain which you can open if you want to get the golden sword. You also get a rope bridge which is able to fall down and two doors which are locked by a wood piece. If you open the doors you can kill the bad guys with the two big axes if you move a lever on the top. You can also shoot them away if you pull the lever on the bottom. The floor will lift up and shoot the minifig like a catapult. I can't complain about this set. It's a fun set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
