"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-14T00:00:00Z","","This set actually only has two new (structural) building elements. First, the orange 1x1x6 pillars, could have been made out of six 1x1x1 cannonballs. The oriental rug is not from another set I know of.Though the onion dome, you can't argue that it could have been made out of other pieces. The top of the two mosques are white divers submarine cockpits, the two large pillars are white versions of the black ones from the largest rockraider set, the base, and the gray ball is from the large one of those older than 2003, younger than the good old town ones, weirdo racers sets, the one where you try to grab it with claws on a truck. This review keeps deleting itself, so I can't mention the number, though I think it was called Grip 'n Go Challenge. Also new are some elephant pieces, the round shields, the scimitars, and the top part of the elephant carrying basket. The gray ball is released when you try to move the giant scorpions right claw. Minifigs can't do that on their own so ""magic fingers"" have to help them. You can also move it by bending a lever at the back of the palace, which is connected by string to a platform, which tips and rolls the ball down the scorpions tail. The trapdoor behind the dome is hard to make a minifig fall through, again, ""magic fingers"" have to shove him through. The golden sheild is actually shaped like the larger castle shields, and of course, is shiny gold. There are five rubies that came with this set, as well as an emerald, sapphire, and topaz (yellow) gem.  I added a plane in between the sizes of 1279 and 5925 for Sam Sinister's use. The board game takes quite a while to finish, and is boring for all of my companions. Maybe they just say that because I have won every time (four times), and it makes it longer when you add the Temple of Mount Everest set and board. There is nothing behind the two doors on the left, or the rug on the right.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-17T20:17:55Z","meh..","...ill do a pros and cons review:

pros: 
cool pieces: elephant, dome, scimitars, pillars, elephant, gold shield
long
pretty cool traps

cons:
not much to it there's no inside
expensive (due to baorad game?)
juniorized
could have used another guard wwith a different weapon
takes up a lot of space for the amount of stuff inside
where do the doorrs and the carpet lead to
half-finished feeling
the trap pokes out too far and it takes up even more space
a con list this long

overall: it's a cool set that is essentiel to the Indian collection but is not as cool as Dragon's fortress and isn't any better than the cheaper temple of Mount everest, tha board game seems bad and a lame way for people to collect every set. There are some cool pieces you might like like the elephant and the dome. If you have the money and some orient sets already buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Com161","2005-10-12T10:49:06Z","Amazing set!!!","This was my first Orient Expedition set. I like the superb detail and the rolling boulder. This set includes 7 game board pieces, 5 mini-figs, traps and more. Now for my review.

Pros:
unique pieces incuding dome
Lego elephant (Wow!!!)
new mini-figs
new swords
traps
game is fun (combine it with 7417 and 7419 for more fun)

cons:
game board is space-consuming
could use more guards
trap door sticks
bush keeps coming off

Overall:
Amazing set but a few things could be fixed up.

"IncredibleMC","2005-12-30T17:18:44Z","Nice but too small","This set is very detailed, but only 2 Indian minfigs are far too less... I like the features and bricks, which are used only in this set - but there are no possibilities to rebuild this set in another way, because there are far too less bricks and minifigs..

"iephant","2007-03-16T01:31:21.92Z","Another giant temple...","Let me be upfront with you; this set is not worth the money i paid. However, if your a collector of unusual pieces this may be the set for you. The building design sucks. It doesn't even have an inside. The scorpion claw trap is pretty cool, releasing a boulder tumbling down upon Jonny or any unfortunate who might be in the way. The minifigures are awesome especially Jonny Thunder and Lord Sinister who are very rare NOT This is my 8th Jonny and 12th Lord Sinister. The Kilroy fig is nice, making it my third Kilroy. The Maharaja is kinda weird {I hate the shields} but the guard minifig is awesome! His face an d torso are a good reason to get this set. If only it came with three or four guards :( anyways, The boulder is the only good trap, with the other being a trap door. The treasure of the palace is The Golden Shield The shield is my favorite golden item with a cool pattern on it. The elephant is sooooo cool! The carriage on top of it is pretty lame but...Its an elephant... Anyways, The two unique pieces are the mushroom dome and the boulder [which doesn't look like a lego] Overall- not worth your money. Maybe if they had included another domed half of the palace it would have been good but

pros:
Elephant
Boulder Trap
Giant Scorpion
Four gems
The Golden Shield
Bases
Guard
Scimatars


cons:
Doors do not lead anywhere
Only one guard is included
Jonny and Lord Sinister
Stupid Elephant Harness
Bad Shields

"Carl","2009-11-18T22:05:28.7Z","Maharaja!","I got this set when I was like 8 or so and I was so excited about getting it. And as it turned out, this set was well in truly worth the wait.

I was super excited because it was my first set over $80(NZD) and also because it was my first Lego elephant. I also thought that the boulder looked pretty cool but I wasn't quite sure how it worked until I built it.

Now onto how I felt afterwards. To cut a long story short: I FELT AWESOME!

The boulder mechanism is sooooo great and it works consistently and every time you pull the scorpion claw...BAM! Bye bye Sinister Sam!

The build of the palace itself is really great and the minifigs rock. The Maharaja is my favourite because of his white turban. The palace guard's spear thing is really well made using a pole and a sword.

The elephant is elephantinely awesome. It has a little carriage thing on its back which someone can sit in.

The Scorpion Palace is a must have Lego set for all who enjoy extreme amounts of playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-15T02:43:40.437Z","A rolling stone ... is a rocking one?","This set is the Death Star of the Indian subtheme of the Orient Expedition (which itself is a subtheme of Adventurers, although it's not marketed as such).  It is a grand building in white with white domes including a specialised onion-shaped dome.  The good use of tan and brown and printed bricks to accentuate the building, and the clever use of accessories, gives the building an interesting Indian look without sacrificing its asthetics.

The other clever thing about the building is the ball launching mechanism, which launches the big ball out the main door of the building.  What's not so clever, of course is that the mechanism takes up most of the entry-way of the building.

The other thing about the building is that it seems a lot more a fascade than an actual palace.  It's missing rooms, particularly a throne room.  A dining room and a ball room would also have been nice.

What it does come with is a nice elephant, complete with parasol.  The Indian minifigs are also nicely decorated, with interesting motifs printed on their torsos and accessories.

This box also includes a board-game with cards, and is probably Lego's first and last forey into tying in board games with a construction toy.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-07T13:53:36.123Z","Indy in India!","This set is one of my more favorable prient sets and I would play with it if I had all the pieces. I got the set for my birthday and wish I never took it to school where I lost the guard(only hav his turban left), the gold sheild, and the two gray swords. This set yeilds tremendeous playiblity and make a fine addition to an indian style adventurer theme. The rolling ball looks like something from indiana jones and works very well as a trap.

pros: sheild

two indian guys

gems

rolling ball

5 minifigs 

kilroys new outfit!

a light gray elephant(one of lego's only two elephants made)

a lot of cool tools

indian styple pieces

Dome top looking pieces

baseplates

bush and pillars

Cons: no rooms

one guard


Overall the cons are very low and it is very good to get ahold of. I rate it a 9/10 for the playibilty for the set. I am still trying to get ahold of the pieces and complete the set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-14T05:21:18.55Z","LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) - Scorpion Palace Review","This set is my largest set of the LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) theme. It has some nice play value and a very good value for minifigs. We also don't need to worry about stickers. This palace set also included a huge ball piece which you can use to defend the treasure chest in front of the big scorpion statue. If you move one claw the ball is coming down and will kill the thief. I really love the details on this set with the shields, the flag on the right side, the doors on the left side, the lanterns, the swords, the small scorpion statues in the front of the building and the domes. We get two smaller domes and a bigger one in the middle. Behind that huge piece you can find a golden shield which is exclusive to this set. There's also a floor which can disappear if you want to take that shield away. This set also comes with an elephant and a board game with a dice.<br><br>This set is really sturdy, fun to build and fun to play with and I also think that this set is one of the must have sets. I also can't complain about the minifigs. We get Johnny Thunder in a new look, Dr. Kilroy in a new look, Lord Sam Sinister in a new look, a guard and maharaja Lallu. The guard and the maharaja both have a turban and a shield. The guard's turban is black and he has a beard and black hair on his face. He also has a blue shirt and gray pants. The maharaja has the white turban and he has a beard on his face and an orange, brown suit. Lord Sam Sinister comes with a black suit, a black top hat and gray pants. Johnny Thunder comes with an exclusive map, a revolver, his basic hat and face, printed, tan pants and a green vest with tan arms. The last minifig - Dr. Kilroy - has a green vest, a white shirt, green pants, a beard, glasses and a sun-helmet.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I got it when I was about 6 and I can remember the fun I had playing with the huge boulder. I also liked the elephant and all the treasure; the jewels and of course the awesome Golden Shield. Overall, from what I can remember, it was a great set.

Boulder
Minifigs
Jewels
Elephant

None
