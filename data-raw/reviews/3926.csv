This is definitely the best recent set i've seen, and i hope that something in 2004 is as good *crosses fingers*.

There's like one trapdoor. Nothing cool like swingin' axes or rotating walls (like in Ninja). The design's OK but not great. The stairs are really a good idea they make it more accessible.

 pros:  the &quot;golden&quot; things are excellent, especially the dragon. There is plenty of room for the figs, and the basement is nice. I must admit I like the BURP in this set. There are a lot of roof pieces. The figs themselves are excellent, the grey guy has eastern-armour and there is hair printed on the BACK of the emperor's head. It also has a black knight/dragon masters plume wheel.Nice half-track.
 cons: The flags suspended on langes have THE LEGO GROUP emblazoned on them in big, unavoidable letters. The trap where rocks fall down a trap-door is stationed right in front of the golden helmet. The mechanism that reveals the golden dragon is very fiddly. But, excellent overall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The Golden helmet is cool for castle war as an artefact, the emperor figure is cool and wizardlike and the dragon could be used as a dragon king. The most impressive feature, however, is the cool sliding wall piece (with the false door) that opens up to the dungeon beneath the castle. I LOVE the mechanism there, where you have to turn both wheels to enter. very cool. The set works fine with the Ninja theme, but it lacks some more guards and perhaps some more defenses by the sides, other then a 1 cm. fence. But that can be fixed... Buy this. It is your destiny.

          It included the brave adventurer (Johnny Thunder), the pussy reporter (Miss Pippin Reed), the mad scientist (Doc. Kilroy) the cool guards and the tyrannical emporer! The corrupt Chinese dudes are a bit like the 1920's Galactic Empire with the guards and the emporer and stuff. Oh yeah, there is also a frieky ghost-man and a chinese chick included, its alotta minifigs. 

     The rover is pretty neat and I first found out that the cabin piece can hold a map behind the seats. The track system works well and it carries the usual load of adventuring gear. The main model takes a long while to build but when you get there, your like &quot;Wow, look at it!&quot;. There is a first entrance hall that holds some red diamonds and a coffin-like thing. It has some neat wall pieces and some round wall struts. The upper flor has the floor trap and holds the traps where you dump the rocks on trespassers. It also holds the golden helmet! You can pull a pin and the floor drops to either drop some heavy rocks on the people below or to make the person standing on it die! The top of the fortress looks very chinese and has the traditional ball-lanterns. A secret basemant floor holds the great prize, the golden dragon! This thing is awesome!

"Novelty","2008-02-14T02:40:37.653Z","Ninja'ed","The Castle Ninja sets of a few years ago were mostly mediocre.  This set is amazing by comparison to those.  The use of the old Ninja bricks gives this building and the former theme some semblance of similiarity, but this one blows the competition out of the water.

Colour-wise, the black/red/tan works great and gives the three-story building a look that is interesting.  The various flags and architectural elements, the use of the brown and light green bricks and the dragon heads on the roof brings the WOW factor for the building.  The staircase to the main door, eventhough plain is manificient.

It's not just the building alone that makes the set great.  Nice touches include the minifigs with oriental motifs and a dragon with gold accents.  The set includes the usual catapault, but also rockets for offensive power.

The Adventurers' part of this set is overshadowed by everything else, but that doesn't mean it's bad - the vehicle, complete with threads is basic, but nicely constructed, and is complete with the big box of tools.

This is probably the best Ninja set ever (eventhough it's not in that theme).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"iephant","2007-03-14T23:24:29.543Z","wow! A great set!","This set is excellent and has a good design! The traps are some what lacking compared to the Temple of Mount Everest and the Scorpion Palace...The build however is much better than the Indian Palace because it actually has an inside! My favorite part about this set is probably the Awesome Grey Soldier with his scimatar! The base is a sweet piece and has little sections that u can take off to make pits! The downstairs is a little cramped with a big throne for the False Emperor to sit on. This can and should be taken off to widen the playability... The traps on this level actually theres only one but still, the trap is to release bricks down on visitors... Its ok but i was hoping for the cool traps like the temple of mount everest...On the top floor the same trap can be used as a trap door to guard the golden helmet. In the basement there is a wall that has doors but they don't lead anywhere except a grey soldier who guards the golden keys! The keys unlock two doors which lead to wheels which must be turned to open the fake wall and get the golden dragon!

pros:
Awesome Base
Grey Soldier
Golden Dragon
Golden Helmet
Nice Catapult on Front
Neat Stairs
The Vehicle Rocks!

Cons:
The Throne is too bulky
My Dragon's wing holding device was terrible
The traps are few and are a little rusty
Only Two Guards were included!
Lamps come off too easily
Price


Thats all the errors I could find. This is however the best Orient Expedition set ever! If you get this for a discount definatly consider picking this ecellent set up!

"jinxjinx550","2008-10-01T22:31:42.343Z","The most beautiful Lego building","I found this set at a yard sale last weekend, and was blown away by it once I had it built.  It's by far the most beautiful Lego building I've ever seen.  

Most of the other reviews focus on the minifigs and the playability factors, like traps and weaponry and so on, but this set is supremely worth it just for the building itself.

The main thing that's so impressive is that the building has perfect proportions.  The structure as a whole is well placed in the baseplate -- not an easy thing, since the baseplate has four wells and a central basement space.  The front stairway is intricately made, and connects the building with the table level, enabling play in the space around the model, instead of just inside the model space itself.

But then the main floor is set on a support structure of black arches and brown 4 x 1 fence pieces, which let light into the dungeon, and raise the floor of the building proper above the top level of the baseplate.  The result is that you end up with a building that gives the impression of having four different levels.

Other people have praised the color scheme, and I agree with them completely.  The mix of tan and black and red is awesome, and the addition of touches of sand green is pure genius.  All of these colors produce a real Chinese feel to the structure, as does the way the multi-level roof is designed to mimic the classic curved shape of pagoda roofs in China.  The use of flags is restrained, and each flag adds something to the overall design.

I have to add that despite all the trashtalking about juniorized pieces, there's a lot to be said for the way some of the Pieces (that could be made) Of Other Pieces can really contribute to the beauty of a structure.  In this set, the tan 1 x 2 x 5 bricks are mixed with red single-piece 1 x 1 x 6 columns and the effect is lovely.  They give a great sense of sturdiness and peacefulness to the building's overall look.  I'm usually a big fan of little decorative bits, and it's easy for me to overdo a MOC by adding so much bling and whimsy that it ends up looking way too fussy.  This set is a graduate course in how to avoid that.

I would love to meet the person who designed this set.  Whoever it was, they deserve an Oscar, or whatever the LegoLand equivalent would be.

"Dr__Kilroy","2011-01-03T18:53:10.403Z","There are only a few 100% set Lego has ever made, but this is definately one of them!","<p>Hi my Lego friends! A lot of fellow fanatics have written reviews to this set. Most of them have listed&nbsp;pros and cons,&nbsp;minifigs, traps etc. Let me leave these fetarues out from my review and please just read my personal feelings about this wonderful set.</p>
<p>The reason I use 'Dr. Kilroy' as a nickname&nbsp;is&nbsp;because an Orient Expedition set (actually Tygurah's Roar) has brought me back from my 'Dark Ages' in 2004 and from that time I'm a collector of all Orient Expedition and Adventurers sets. In fact I consider 'Orient Expedition' as an Adventurers subtheme, and I'd&nbsp;never list it&nbsp;on its own, but never mind...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the Dragon Fortress&nbsp;right in front of me&nbsp;on my desk, I hardly find words to describe my fascination by the beauty and the grandeur of this set. I've bought this set in 2005, built it several times and I've never gotten bored of building and playing with it.</p>
<p>It is very rare nowadays for Lego to build alternatives and include alternative building pictures on the box, because the sets are very specialized nowadys. It is not a complaint from me, &nbsp;I like modern Lego sets too, but this set is&nbsp;so OLD FASHIONED - in a good sense, and Lego included two fantastic alternative building pictures on the box and I've spent a lot of time just be trying to build them. It was so much fun, and I've managed to built the one which is similar to the Flying Ninja Fortress. The other one was so hard, I needed to add some extra&nbsp;pieces from my&nbsp;spares to manage to finish it.</p>
<p>The main attraction of course is the Dragon Fortress itself, which is not only a fantastic (actually the best) Adventurers set, but it is a great&nbsp;Castle set too, and it can be used in a modern Lego city too as Chinese Restaurant. That's what I call versatility.&nbsp;By an aeshetical point of view, it is simply perfect. The tan-red-black colour scheme is perfect and every little detail is there to please the spectators (yes, again!).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime I build it, I marvel at the perfection of the finished building and the lot of playing features inculded in this set.&nbsp;Moreover, it does the&nbsp;big raised simmetrical baseplate justice. This special part is often critized in the 6091/6098, 8781 and 10176&nbsp;reviews. The reason is because those sets are use this baseplate in a - somehow -wrong way, but not this one. Here we have a huge main building right over the middle section behind a stairway, which is usual in the Adventurers theme (see 7627 and 7327 too) but&nbsp;Lego designers didn't want to fill up the four little wholes with tiny and fragile separate towers, like in 10176, they've&nbsp;just&nbsp;added little supplementary buildings, weapons and ornaments etc.&nbsp;which&nbsp;did not not consume the pieces and did not detract them from being built to the main part of the building. That's why the main part of the Fortress is so beautiful. It has enough pieces to be detailed and beautiful.&nbsp;So if you&nbsp;use that big raised&nbsp;baseplate cleverly you won't have problem with it (the other fine example is the Amazon Ancient Ruins).</p>
<p>What's more to say? Using the included parts I have endless building possibilities on my own too! I like the minifigs very much and if I find the chinese gurads a little few in number I just place there the other two guys from the Emperor's Ship, which is a cheap army builder set if you want to have more chinese guards. I'm the one who like the board game too and I've played it several times with my sons, however the first&nbsp;part of the game included in the Temple of Mount Everest can be played better. The good thing is, that you can change the rules if you want, so you can raise the playing possibilities.</p>
<p>This set is&nbsp;an ultimate masterpice and after few years of its release it is already a Legend! Don't you miss it! Don't pass by, if you can get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I finished it in time to show my cousins, one of which sat on it accidentally, broke it, and I just couldn't build it again.

This set is huge. If it gets wrecked, however, and never built again, its baseplate is rather hard to work with.

The baseplate is a special valley sort of thing, and as far as I know, only available in this set. It comes with 8 minifigs, and an odd sort of car. It also comes with a dragon.

The size of the fortress is amazing, and includes a giant plate on which the lower level is built. There is also a booby trap in which a trapdoor falls and leads to a dungeon.

The trapdoor&nbsp;also works as a secondary booby trap to send more rocks down on those whom enter the fortress. Overall the build of the top half resembles a lot of Asian architecture and this is a very nice touch.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">This set is great, you get many traps, and awesome minifigs to play for hours on end.
