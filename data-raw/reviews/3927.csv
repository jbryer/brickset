I tried to paste the little target things on the red dots, but it didn't work. Remember, Frogger &amp; FRiends is watching!!!! Blah ha ha !",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-12T10:23:35Z","Cool color scheme!","     One thingh I like about this set is that the plane looks like a military one. It has the machine guns on the front hardpoint, a nice tall wing setting and the back is just like any other lego bi-plane! The wheels are very nice and it is the perfect World War 1 plane in your arsenal!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T13:35:38Z","Very nice set - Good detail","A very good set. Detail is good. I also think that they could have replaced the steering wheel with a joystick. The wheels and prop is very smooth running. The small little red wheel at the back is stationary. It would be nice if that could turn. Remind me of the old double wing planes in the pioneer days of flying. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-01T01:20:40.717Z","A bit of a let down","Found some more of my planes today and thought I should review some of them. This one is from the late Orient Expedition which was a good series to add to the adventure collection.

The plane itself is quite simple in its construction but has some very nice pieces to enhance it's shape and is aesthetically pleasing. The propeller is able to spin which I feel is a must. It has a small windshield to help protect the pilot and has duel shotgun's mounted on top of the bi-plane's wings.

The pilot is  Johnny Thunder and he is in his usual adventurers shirt with black pants and his brown, wide brimmed hat.

LEGO QUOTE: &quot; Johnny Thunder never knows where the next adventure will take him -- but he knows the Thunder Blazer will get him there! Take off in this vintage bi-plane in search of ancient treasure.&quot; from lego.com

The plane is quite bare but the only real gripe or fault I have with this model is how plain the rear of the plane actually is. Also the rear wheel seems a little cheap.

Overall its a nice little plane very basic but good for display and makes and adds a little to the series. Not very high in playability on it's own but is excellent with other models. I feel this model is about a 5/10 because it is nice but LEGO have done much nicer planes in previous series and this series having so many cool bits and new pieces they really could have done it bit more with this one. Still I would recommend this one to any one who likes planes or the adventure series. If your looking for one cool bi-plane for your collection, keep looking.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-11-11T12:59:55.437Z","Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to bombardier. Bombs away.","I used to have this set when I was little. I would fly it around and swoop down on Yeti's Hideout and take out the monster. Fun. This set has a very good structure and is historically accurate as far as I can remember. I like the rifles mounted on the wing and always loved the Johnny Thunder minifig. Looking back, I wish I still had this. I could do battle with Scarecrow's biplane, and Johnny Thunder would make a good Billy Bishop...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-09T22:22:23.077Z","Good Biplane","This is really a great set from a great theme. It may not be as good as the Bi-Wing Baron, but this has guns on the top and has Johnny Thunder. The wheels should be the Adventurers type which would be much better. However, this is pretty good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"merkinized75","2008-12-09T07:35:56.263Z","Great plane, but still not enough good","I got this plane on Christmas 2003. It looks great, but still not enough good. Here are pros and cons:

pros:
-Johnny Thunder minifigure
-shotguns mounted on top of the wings
-design
-spinning rotor

cons:
-should have come with one more minifigure &amp; some more accessories

Still a great set.

"Zaragan","2011-09-29T15:41:40.52Z","One of the sets with most memories for me.","<p>This is one great little airplane that are one of the two Orient expedition-sets that I own. I bought it many years ago in the local toystore. What I did´nt realise back then was really how great this set is. It doesnt take that many minutes to build, at least not for a teenager like me. But the playability is great! Even if i just have played with it single, not with any other sets. I´m not a estetic person so i dont care that much if the colours of a set doesnt match, but in this set they do! I really like the brown wings with the guns at the top. And the red thing before the black propeller. And of course that little window Jonny can look out from. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont really like to combine sets with others, that means I dont care for what parts is with a set, only the set is cool. Now it´s time for the cons... I must admit that I really cant find any real bad thing about this set. but if I have to mention one thing, nothing is perfect, then it would be that jonny´s hat&nbsp;can fall of easily if you dont take care when you put him in the pilotseat. The guns can take it of...</p>
<p>Overall rating: 5/5. This set is one of the best I own but because it is so full of memories for me is it hard to give a fair rating.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
