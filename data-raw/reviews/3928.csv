Dr. Kilroy= Explorer's cap
Johnny Thunder= Cowboy hat thingy.
Pippen Reed= Brown flight helmet, With googles.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T00:31:17Z","A weak plane","I love the Adventurers, but I think this is probably the weakest set. Even for its size, it is poor. Notice that Johnny doesn't even have pockets on his pants in this - I know the set is cheap, but how did that save on costs? The plane is pretty shabby, too: I like the engine, but it is hard to get the pilot in and out without breaking another part of the plane off. This set should have had Pippin - she only appears three times in Orient Expedition - or at least had flying goggles for Johnny.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-04T06:08:00Z","Pippin should be in this!!","Though impractical for a plane in real life, the plane looks good on display and is relatively well-designed, for such a small set. My biggest gripe, as echoed by almost all the other reviews, is that Pippin should be in this set, to avoid building JT armies. (I know a guy with 50!!) She is the pilot anyway, and is pretty absent from the line. I also feel she has the best torso print detail.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-07T13:38:02.967Z","Where's Pippen Reed?","I like this et design even though it is a weak set and use it as a mini plane. It doesn't always break and it does have a pistol in it. Over all the cons kinda balance it out to make it a 3 but I give it a 4 because I play with it a lot. Although pippen reed should have been in this set I would still settle over johnny than another sam.

Pros: playiblity with other sets

pistol

Thunder(always happy to get one)

some rare plane elements

Cons: pippen reed should have the plane

pant legs are confusing becasue of no pockets

weak stucture


I still like the set but it could have been improved. I give it a 7.5/10.0 and reccomend about 1-3 dollars for buying this set if you want to. After all I only paid about a dollar to 50 cents for it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-07T15:28:53.2Z","Good plane","This small set from the orient expedition is just small, but have some parts of the building that are nice for a small, and also have useful pieces and a good color scheme, with some schemes of red, gray and black. Johnny Thunder, the minifigure included, is simple but nicely designed, with simple details and color scheme, but cool, also with the hat, in a good shape. The building involved in this small set is on the plane, builted with a plate as a base, and some pieces with different shapes to connect the little wheels. The cockpit, above the plate, have the sides coverd by some other blocks, making little walls that cover the legs of the minifigure, when this stay on it. The back have a triangolar shape, and is small, with the minifigure, it is in a bad position. The minmifigure stays very well, but the position of somethings like the wings  and back makes it bad. The front is good builted for a small, altough the wings aren't in the better position. The wings are simple plates, connected by the base and little pilars. On the front, there is a propeller, that moves well and is increased with a circular piece. The playability is not tyhe best due to the front and back positions, and too the size of the wheels, but it still good in design and in somethings, the building is well for the size. Overall, a good small set with some problems on a building and playability. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>1) could afford or </p>
<p>B) deemed worthy of purchasing. </p>
<p>(more than likely 1, though I do see a dwindling between the Desert to Jungle to orient sets) However&nbsp;Pippen seems to look a lot like Gail Storm.&nbsp; At any rate, I didn't mind good ol JT being in this set as it was a different version than the previous ones I had.&nbsp; His hat still won't stay on very well though.</p>
<p>Just rebuilt this one.&nbsp; Very fast and very simple, but has som enice pieces you don't see everyday like the thin wheel base, tail section and&nbsp;engine compartment.</p>
<p>It's a bit bigger than I remembered it (or than it looked in the instructions) but still a tiny little plane.&nbsp; Can't see taking this on any long trips as the wind sheer would drive anyone insane after a while and again Johnny's hat barely stays on as it is.&nbsp; Front protection with the wind shield and all, but odd that the legs are not protected one bit.</p>
<p>For a little pond-hopper of a plane it's not too bad and it looks quite original, yet not out of place against other prop planes.&nbsp; These mini sets almost remind me of the mini vehicles star wars used to produce in the 80s.&nbsp; Never in the movies, but as a kid great fun to have.</p>
<p>Now where's that lego runway?</p>
