"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-18T00:00:00Z","","I'm wondering about getting this just for Dr. Kilroy and tools. 4 USD, so probably no, but I'm not going to get the hot air balloon for him, so I'm in doubt. And guys, if it is called Mountain Sleigh, it probably isn't for the non-existant swamps in the Himalayas. But I agree, a few okay pieces thrown together at random almost. I also agree, a mini set with the shirpa (Sangye Dorje) might have been nice, but this guy is useful for a collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-28T13:45:24Z","Nice little set","The sleigh it self is ok. But it has 2 little red fences. great.
Iwould like it also when they put some more special characters (friends and foes) in the little set. You get always army's of Johnny, Kilroy and Lord Sinister.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-04T06:00:28Z","Great for a wee little set","This was actually quite common in Singapore, and I got it on discount from an already affordable price. Though not as complex or well-designed as the other sets in this &quot;mini&quot; line (Red Eagle etc...), the set is excellent for parts for a small set, especially the fences which can hold plates up and the sleigh bottom. A nice small set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-14T02:55:49.61Z","Winter wonderland","This small set is nicely put together, despite its size.  Runners, a chair, sides and the front made out of fences and a light in front attached to the fence.  An ice pick would have been a better accessory than the binoculars, but that doesn't reduce the play value of the set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
