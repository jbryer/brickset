"Smallsam99","2008-04-06T17:13:03.217Z","Why bad Reviews?","This set is good and I only got it for 1 buck! I like small vehicles for lego battles and like this one's design. I think people judge this set too fast because it really isn't that bad!

pros: gun and bionioculars

car design

crate

Cons: another sinister!( i have to admit he is cool but is used to much in this theme)

nothin else!

It is worth it and I reccomend buying it from $1.00-$5.00 price range.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
