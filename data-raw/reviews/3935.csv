It was too big to wrap so my parents put it in the living room on Christmas morning for jaw-dropping purposes.  I don’t remember any of the other presents from that year (there may have been a replacement Rubik’s cube under the tree, but I don’t know).  You could have set the house on fire that Christmas break and I wouldn’t have known it, that’s how involved with this set I got.  

The 744 comes with instructions to build a number of models, all of which involve the inclusion of a body that contains a battery-powered motor and associated gear reduction system.  This set also contains far more pieces (mostly yellow and black) than the 733 or 722 sets.  The 744 uses larger wheels than does the 733 or 722, allowing larger creations (my favorite was a big moon-patrol exploration-type vehicle).  It was a great set for those transitioning into the Technic realm, as it combined the best of the two worlds of Lego models and Technic sets.  

Nowadays, I imagine most of the 744’s parts would be available in supplementary sets, since it would be a good source of replacement parts for practically any set.  Back in the early 1980s it was pretty special, though.  It compares favorably to the 912 of the 1970s.  The 744 gets 10/10 for intense playability, 25 April 2004
