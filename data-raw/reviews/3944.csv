<p>So, I&#39;ll start this off by saying, I&#39;m a hardcore Little Robots fan, so getting some Lego releases of the characters was a must, Stretchy was top of my list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mine was bought used so it was missing his junk collecting barrel/drum, but the figure alone is amazing. The articulation is fantastic, and just the overall design looks like he was ripped straight out of the show, genuinely such a great looking figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only problem with mine, it that is should have a &quot;lights and sound&quot; feature, although mine had light, sound function was broken, still though it&#39;s a great figure.</p>
