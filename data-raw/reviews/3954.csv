"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-08T00:00:00Z","","I recently built mine, and it looks very good. Too many stickers though, 24 are used. I put the stickers on later, when I finally decided they would make it look better. I would recommend two, too, one for parts, and one for display. Lots of white parts:  blank R2 bodies (Which have stickers applied to them in the instructions), blank minifig heads, some disks, and more. Also, a neat addition is a CHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME (say it like a cow mooing, but deeper on the O's), yah, you read it right, a CHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME disk.  I removed mine from the model immediately, and replaced it with a black (my gray ones are being used as plates in my town, so I have no extras of those) one. I put it on the lance of my chrome (chrome helmet, sword, and breastplate), black knight lord's horse, as decoration. I seriously recommend this, as it is a great deal, looks great, and has great parts. Oh, I forgot to mention, the mini Shuttle Endeavor is nice, but not actually that good. No, there aren't any microfigs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

If you buy this I advice you not to put the stickers on because the pieces for the solarpannels are great to use for windows 
this is cool set with some great pieces for a great price",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bjornkeizers","2006-03-25T17:16:02Z","Outstanding little micro set!","I picked up 3 of these sets last year; two to use and one as a spare. I am a space nut, so I love building mockups of tiny little space stations. You can really have a lot of fun with all these tiny little modules! Excellent playability, superb for parts use, why not buy a bunch of them!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-22T08:32:52.577Z","Zeta","This is the smallest set in the &quot;Discovery&quot; licensed theme, and it is also a micro set, meaning that it is smaller than the minifig scale.  The set consist of a space station, a shuttle and a black stand to display the set.

The space shuttle is nicely done on such a small scale - it is designed and built solidly.  Although it is mostly white, like the real space shuttle, the one in this set has a special painted brick to add a some colour to the vehicle.

There is nothing special about the stand other than the fact that it's made out of black pieces, some of which were previously used as train roof.  The stand (not shown on the box's image) confirms the design intent of this set, that it is to serve mainly as a display set rather than a &quot;play&quot; set.

The Space Station on first glance might appear to be the International Space Station, but actually, it is not.  It is really some random space station created by Lego for this set that resembles the space station, but has the wrong amount of pressurised modules and solar panels.  This is a disappointing point - if it was meant for display, surely an accurate approximation of the space station would have been better than this weird hybrid?  It is also unwieldy to play with the space station due to the shape and nature of it - pieces are easily detached during play.

Overall, this set looks good and seems to be designed for display, but it is NOT the International Space Station - not the International Space Station that was flying during the time this set was released, now the International Space Station at any point during its assembly, and not the final International Space Station in the near future when its construction is complete.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-19T19:19:40.53Z","Not Good in Micro Scale","The set has the smallest amount of pieces in the Discovery series. It should have been in minifigure scale which would have been much cooler, The solar panels make this set very detailed. I don't really like the micro shuttle which is the reason it should be in minifig scale. This set isn't bad, but it isn't good either.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-16T12:09:49.937Z","International Space Station","This is a small set of the Discovery theme. This set is really small and with no much playability. But it  have reasons to be not much playable. The set was made to looks like a replica of the space station, made with small pieces. The Internacional Space Station can be also classified as a micro set, due to the pieces used on the building, pieces like the minifigures white heads. But the size is not important in the set because this is the objective, a small replica. The space ship is small like the mini ships of the star wars theme, and no minifigures can ride on it. But this set is good builted and designed. The solar plates be fixed well in the pieces, and it really looks like a replica of the station, but of course in a micro size. The other pieces included be fixed very well, as support. Due to the building, design and looks like a micro replica of the real station but no good playability, i rate this set 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
