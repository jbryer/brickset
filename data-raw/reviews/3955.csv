The Saturn V, the Command Service Module and Lunar Rover are pretty accurate representations whereas the Lunar Module leaves a little to be desired. The Saturn V and Command Service Module use stickers to bring them to life but really do look the part. The lunar rover is farly accurate as the real thing is just a base with four wheels and a couple of seats mounted on it. However the lunar module is the worst part in my opinion. It is flimsy and inaccurate and could have been better done (which would have probably put the price up) or left out altogether. Even after one of my modification jobs it still strugles to satisfy me at this scale. The superb 10029 lunar lander set is far better. I would have preferred a launch tower/platform instead like in the superb Delta set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
