The rocket, pad and tower cannot be faulted. Stickers are accurate and authentic. Construction of the launch tower and the wrap around booster rockets can get a little confusing/tedious as it involves lots of the same bricks on top of each other, but the result is well worth it and very impressive. The Martian Rover is also amazingly accurate and has a clever sprung suspension system aided by rubber bands. It looks nearly as good as the much larger set 7471. The satelite is also OK with interesting stickers for the solar panels. You get a lot for your money here and if you are a person who likes accuracy and authenticity you will not be disappointed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-03-24T15:21:22.983Z","Mars rover","Based on the Mars 2001 odessy mission and mars rover missions this review will be seperated into 3 parts
Mars 2001 odessy(satelite):Has a display stand with a picture of mars and transparent pieces to hold it up. It  has a pretty simple design.
The rover has many rare blue pieces and it has an arm to examine rocks.It has a variety of gadjets including a camera,antenna and wheels that look almost like the real one.
rocket:has a long white piece to stabalize it plus all these stickers. there is a rope and stick to keep it from falling or moving.the base also keeps it from moving so it's pretty stable(sometimes).
Overall this is a great set for anybody with rare pieces and well worth 19.99 USD.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

As an avid fan of Space (not just the theme, although I could be considered a LEGO Space fanatic as well as a real life space one). The ONE thing that really bugs me is this-the stickers. There are tons of awesome stickers-LEGO couldn't have afforded to make printed parts at the time, but it's pathetic-these stickers span multiple parts, making it so that if you take them apart, these great things are wasted.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Very nice. They have the rocket taking off in a different place than the rover is driving. The little satellite is hovering over mars, and the clouds of dust, the stars, and rocket emissions add realism (but not too much) to this scene. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Superb. The set has a very good parts value (8 cents per part!). There are a lot of parts who were rare in those colors at the time (and still aren't ultra-common in them today), such as sand green 2x2 cylinders, dark blue wings, white pips connected by a string, 1x3 tan radar dish, and entirely rubber wheels. They also have some chrome dishes, and numerous other parts. My one complaint about this set is the stickers-the older stickers had much better sticking power than today, as evidenced by the fact that the stickers on my 7327 are peeling off as we speak while those that have a solar panel pattern STILL remain on it today. Even so, many of them are gone-I'd have appreciated this set much more if the stickers only spanned one part (instead of ""holding"" two together) and/or if they were printed.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>It was simple-but at 2003, there was so much juniorization around that this build would have been considered quite refreshing. The only real issue is that the tower is made of a lot of large bricks-they don't have very good suction. Or the fact that some parts are held together by stickers. But otherwise, it's solid.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's not amazingly impressive, but you it does look quite decent. The tower has the best appearance, but there was a nice use of parts throughout. The suspension on the rover is very nice, and the rocket has a great shape.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The set is great. It has a good price, great part value, a lot of cool parts. It's playable, although that's not the main intention. There isn't much that I'd improve, and other than stickers, this is a great set. I highly recommend it to fans of the space race. The sticker sheet has some nice stickers, and they should last a long time if placed solely on one piece.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
