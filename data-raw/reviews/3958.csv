But still, it is excellent nonetheless. Also, thank you Stefan for making that comment. THis is a quality set that cannot be beaten by any bionicle set and many of the technic sets. Easdrt, i don't see how you can only enjoy bionicle and technic sets. Regular bricks are the basis of lego. Without it, i beat you even your bionicle wouldn't by created. you have no excuse to say that regular bricks are bad. They only recieve bad results and reviews from people like you! find another life with action figures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-31T18:36:24Z","Pretty amazing set","I got mine for 24.99 at target. A huge load of parts so if you see it on sale, do yourself a favor and buy two.

The Good.
-very few specialty parts
-Moving parts
-Hubble telescope
-Very realistic
-looks easy to modify. one could do a buran-conversion or add an &quot;enterprise&quot; tail cone
-great display piece

The Bad.
-Stickers!!!
-...stickers over multiple pieces
-technic style construction gets boring.
-no spare rubber bands if one breaks
-main landing gear too weak. folds right in if you put any pressure on the back. (not good for rough landings...)
-landing gear exposed and visible from the top of the wings.
-some cockpit detail would be nice
-cargo doors are tricky to close when loaded with robot arm AND satellite.
-stickers only for &quot;Discovery.&quot; Atlantis, Endeavor, Columbia, Challenger, and Enterprise would have been nice and inexpensive to do...

Highly recommended.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-12T05:37:33Z","Love it!","I just got done putting this together and it was an awesome build. Great looking nose, big hinged doors, working retractable wheels that stay locked in or out, Tail Rudder that moves but still looks good, nice engine placement... I had to take 1 point off for too many neo-Technic parts crammed inside and no minifigs, otherwise this would have received an 11. Really really worth it on sale, looks great as a display model (now there's a new theme idea: Space Model Team!), doesn't get much better than this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-06T19:19:42Z","THE BEST SPACE SHUTTLE YET!!!!","Okay I just bought it today for no reason.....

THE GOOD
1.) Perfect dimensions
2.) No special pieces!
3.) Lots and lots of bricks!
4.) Working landing gear
5.) All Fins are positionable
6.) Very decent satillite
7.) Working arm
8.) Looks absolutely majestic!

THE BAD
1.) No room for mini figs
2.) The arm leaves a little to be desired.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-28T07:11:16Z","full price","I finally opened this the other night, after getting it when it first came out

Pros
Time consuming build, does look nice. A piece of history, particularly with Hubble telescope. The way the wheels flick out is great. At price it is now it's definitely worth it.

Cons
Too fiddly a build, so many technic pieces, spare pieces but no spare rubber bands, lack of versatility to build other things like a traditional lego set.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T17:15:32Z","For the dedicated builder only.","      I got this wonderful set with the gift card at target. It is at a fair price for the amount of pcs it has (820.). There is a ton of white and black bricks both flat and thick. There is also alot of technic stuff so if you cant build technic, dont even bother at this. The technic stuff is what operates the mutual landing gear, the back engine cones, and the robotic arm inside the payload bay. The one problem that the box lies about, the robotic arm cannot support the wait of the hubble telescope that comes with it unless positioned excactly right!!! This is not built for minifigs, unfortunately. However, I somehow modified it so that the upper half of the fig's torso can be fitted it along with avionics and stuff. The other problem is that the landing gear will slip back if you try to make the shuttle land or stand. This can be fixed by putting bricks behind the landing gear so that it blocks the wheel struts from falling backward. It is a super beauty once done but it takes a good 2 or more hours, probably more. This set rocks and because the probablems can become easily fixed, give it an outstanding 10! I recommend this for the experienced builder and if you can modify it for mini-fig pilots like i did, it can make some heck of a spacecraft, on to you, Houston!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The only problems were that it was a bit fragile and there are no replacment rubber bands if any broke.
