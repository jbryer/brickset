Year of release: 1985<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: train starter set (entry level / push-a-long)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7710<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
In 1985, the majority of the train line-up became overhauled. All starter sets were replaced, except 7725 which disappeared without successor. At first glance, 7715 looks very similar to its predecessor 7710, just built with other colors. But it had been improved in details and general appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
The steam engine shows the greatest differences to 7710. Now, it has doors, it has more modern parts and details, and the construction is much more solid. There is still a motor dummy built of basic bricks and train wheels, which can be replaced by either a 4,5v or 12v motor. Again, the black motor results in a strange appearance. If possible, use a red 12v motor.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
The two wagons are identical, it&#39;s the stickers that make them first or second class. In contrast to the wagons from 7710, there is a fence-built storage section for the passengers&#39; suitcases. The color scheme is the same as it was used by the single wagon 7818. However, when 7715 was released, 7818 has been dropped already from the line-up.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
The track is a complete circle without straight sections. And there is a small station platform that helps the passengers to get in and out.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are no known variants of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Small things make a big change. Although very similar to 7710, it looks more modern. And the alternative model shows how to build a nice little diesel engine.</p>

"Naylus","2020-09-21T22:19:35.69Z","Steam Locomotives are Genuinely Great","<p>And Lego proves, that great design&nbsp;lives beyond time and trends, as one the old locomotives got a re-release in 2020. I always thought, the trains of those times were remarkably beautiful in many ways. That&#39;s why I ordered 7715, which I admired through pictures in old catalogues of 1980s.</p>

<p>This set made its way into Lego universe in 1985, but remained in stores up to the 1990, even when <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7745-1/High-Speed-City-Express-Passenger-Train-Set"">7745</a> was released. I find the retro touch of this small train very neat and memorable.</p>

<p><strong>The Train</strong><br />
Lego seems to have established their rule of 3 &#39;cars&#39; a long time ago: here you have an old black locomotive with 2 doors (15 cm in length) and simple details for lights and steams. The passenger cars (14-15 cm&nbsp;in length) have 2 doors as well and seats for 2 passengers each, though you can place more people inside. It&#39;s cool to see, that the designers added a small shelf for luggage inside&nbsp;too. Both cars have black &#39;doors&#39; in between them, even though this is a pure decoration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many stickers, which are applied to doors and walls (giving numbers 1 and 2 to cars), as well DB logo. Too bad the connecting pieces can be easily broken and they actually do over time, as seen in the very set, which I bought last year.</p>

<p><strong>The Rails and the Platform</strong><br />
7715 offers to build a round path for the train, which consists of old separate grey rails. It&#39;s possible to distinguish them by length and the texture. There is no electric rail, as this locomotive was intended for push-along play, but an update is possible however.</p>

<p>The platform is small and is fit to receive passengers from 1 car at a time. There is a timetable, made of 3 white bricks and a sticker with different cities.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong><br />
There are 3 very simple passengers with bags (no prints on clothes) and 2 railway employees in uniform with prints.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
This was definitely a good toy for the children of 1980s and would be much fun even for the kids of today, though most of Lego fans would expect a train to run by itself. As mentioned before, it&#39;s possible to modify the locomotive, so that it could run on metal rails.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of design it differs drastically from modern counterparts, such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10194-1/Emerald-Night"">10194 The Emerald Night</a> &ndash; one of the latest steam engines, not to mention Hogwarts Express. For me 7715 is as much nostalgia as pleasure of building and reliving the good memories.</p>
