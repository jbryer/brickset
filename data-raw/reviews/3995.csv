Luckily my parents had the foresight to get extra track and switches so I had a whole empire. It was fun to build and build and keep building. The only thing I hated was the magnetic couplers would pop-out of the holders. Nowadays that would be a huge recall or something but back then we knew not to put them in our mouths. A great set.

Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: train starter set (entry level / battery operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7722</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
When the new system was introduced in 1980, this was the smallest goods train starter set available.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
The red diesel locomotive looks somewhat blocky, but the design is unique until today. Similar to set 7710, the heavy 4,5v motor is connected to the train base by only 4 studs (once more, in the successor set 7722 this issue was improved). Two red 1x6 bricks help to reinforce the housing without changing the look. It can be upgraded with a 12v motor (additional conducting rails for the track are required). As the 12v motor has black wheels, the look is a little bit different from the original design which has red wheels. Furthermore, the lights kit 7861 can be installed very easily.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
The first wagon is the battery car, therefore is has faked (stickered) doors and very limited playability. It was carried over from the 1970s without any change, which means that it still has the red and blue connecting magnets.<br />
Then, there is a flatbed wagon which is intended to carry the little bucket loader which is also included in the set.<br />
The last wagon is a freight car with brakeman&#39;s cab, it has an unusual longer wheelbase (18 studs) compared to the standard short wagons (16 studs).</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
The track is a complete circle with an additional total of four straight sections. And there is a small platform with ramp, to load and unload the wagons. There is also a small yellow bucket loader, which is similar to set 6630 from 1981. Another additional item is a small level crossing with two hand-driven gates.<br />
Finally, there are a stop signal and two direction switches, which help to operate the train.</p>

<p>Variants and alternate parts<br />
This set comes either with the first (767) or second (4166) version of the dark gray sleeper plates.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
I really like this set, because it looks different than any other train sets of the grey era. The battery operated motor is not that fast, but it makes the train to move like a hinny: nothing can stop it. As always with goods trains, playability is quite good.</p>

"PeteM","2020-02-18T00:44:42.23Z","Switching It Up","<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Forty years ago this year, the Lego Train line was refreshed and re-launched into what has become known as &lsquo;the grey era&rsquo; (as the colour of the tracks was changed from blue to a more prototypical grey). As before, there were </span></span></span><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">differing entry points into the range, from unpowered push-along sets to the full remote control offered by the mains-powered 12volt&nbsp;system. Sitting between the two was the battery operated &#39;4.5 volt&#39;&nbsp;system, of which 7720 was the sole representative in the first wave of new sets.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Box &amp; Build</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">As with all larger sets in the 80s, the box had a flip lid, with the box art offering plenty of photos of both the primary set and a variety of alternative models to fire the imagination. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">There were plenty of new pieces introduced in this year, including the train doors (with moulded glass inserts), buffers with revolving magnetic couplers, and an upgraded one-piece train base which sat over and around the motor. Also included were a number of hangovers from the 4.5v sets of the previous era, such as the large battery wagon and the motor unit itself, as well as trackside features like the semaphore signal and crossing barriers.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The build itself is entirely straightforward, and even with the instructions rushing through, there is little to challenge most builders. The most complex section is probably the small loading platform which utilises a combination of black plates and bricks for the frame and uses jumper plates to offset the ramp and ensure it fits together surprisingly snugly.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">As with most larger sets of the era, full instructions are included for a couple of alternative builds &ndash; in this case, a steam engine and some kind of electric tram or small loco. Both of these utilise pieces from all the elements of the primary build (minus the battery wagon), so accompanying rolling stock would need to be improvised from whatever is left over but, as such, they are a great encouragement for an imaginative child to start down the road of custom models.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The Completed Model</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The end result is a charming little diesel switcher &ndash; I struggled to find a specific prototype, but the locomotive evokes any number of small industrial engines on the European rail network in the 60s and 70s. Despite being in the vanguard of the grey era re-launch, it&rsquo;s not actually too much of a departure from what had come before &ndash; design-wise it owes much to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/183-1/Train-set-with-motor-and-signal"">183</a>, while a lot of the functionality (the 4.5 motor unit and separate battery wagon, the signal that controls the train, the reversing pole etc) was carried over wholesale from the previous era. Though not especially speedy around the oval of track, the motor is surprisingly powerful and can pull many more wagons than those supplied with the set &ndash; helped enormously by the fact the motor block is immensely heavy!</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The set is slightly compromised in a few areas thanks to uninspiring rolling stock, most notably the bulky battery wagon and the basic flatbed truck &ndash; the former, though a necessary evil, is a legacy of the early 1970s, complete with old fixed magnets (red at one end, blue at the other), though at least the new revolving magnetic couplers make integration into a rake slightly easier. The latter makes a feature of being bland &ndash; it can be used to transport nearly anything, though doesn&rsquo;t offer easy access from the ramp and loading platform. While I have no idea what the last wagon is supposed to be, it has the most playability (almost by default) as the main gondola can be filled with loose bricks from digger, carried around the track, and then emptied via the shutters around the sides.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">However, this is a set designed at the emergence of the minifigure and this is where it most obviously benefits by departing from its predecessors. With minifigs being introduced only two years before, the engine and the caboose now have to have proper opening doors to aid the interaction between the figures and the set &ndash; the set is no longer just something that goes around and around a track towing some wagons. This shift is even more obvious in the inclusion of a digger and driver (the first time a train set had come with a separate vehicle) as it means play is no longer solely based on the track, it could integrate with other Town sets and extend playability beyond the train environment.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;""><span style=""font-family:Arial"">So, though not revolutionary, this is still a great entry set to the Train theme &ndash; keeping the best of the previous era with the inclusion of the signal and switching post while embracing the changes to play that the minifig was bringing. Combined with ready access to expansion sets (track, more exciting rolling stock and trackside structures), this showed that the 4.5v system still had a place in the new &#39;grey&#39; world.</span></span></span></p>

"BurakT","2018-01-18T16:00:30.867Z","This set is a start of a new era","<p>I got this set in 2018 from a local online auction site and it was a very lucky find for a bargain. Not sure if there is one more here. So, I think we need to evaluate this set according to it&#39;s release year, 1980.</p>

<p>For that time, this set is the start of a new era. End of Blue era and start of Grey era. This looks more like a real train and the railways are more realistic in terms of color and shape.</p>

<p>Battery box, forward-reverse switch and implementation of the power motor to a powered train set is very innovative. After 38 years, this train still runs smoothly. This proves the quality of design.</p>

<p>I think, the design of the cars could be more attractive but they are fair enough.</p>

<p>Locomotive looks very impressive with big doors, vent gates, lights, yellow-black stripes and bumpers. These are very impressive according to that day&#39;s standards.</p>

<p>Road crossing and the opening-closing barriers are very nice addition to this set as well. You can combine this set with many other sets with road base and it will look very nice.</p>

<p>Loader is a little bit a let-it-go job. So simple with a very limited playability but it is okay. O forklift could do a better job.</p>

<p>All in all, this set is very inspiring for any Lego fan. I can&#39;t say it is a must have but any collector or Lego fan who wants an era opener, should get this set. This is a true part of the great 80&#39;s Lego.</p>

<p>I think prices are quite fine for this set in used markets so it looks like a good buy and value for money. Just be aware of corroded and broken battery boxes which is quite common.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and have fun!</p>
