I must've gotten this set when I was too young. Looking at that picture I can see a wonderfully basic set for a beginner.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The little train must have chugged a thousand miles before I got tired of it and made something else.  I miss the elegant simplicity of the little motor and had hours of fun loading freight, building and converting train cars and playing with various track layouts.

"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-27T07:44:22.183Z","Steaming Stamps & Envelopes","In all Lego train sets, the main thing they do for a layout is to expand it in various positive ways. Most are a decent choice of set for the depth of action, stories, imagination and infrastructure that they add and this one is no different and is approximately low to middle of the range for ability, scale, size and price.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Red capped 'blue work shirt' era train driver.</li><li>Colour coordinated cargo worker.</li><li>Red mail uniformed post master.</li></ul><br><div><b>Making Tracks</b></div></div><div>Not always convinced of the universal use or ability of the sleeper plates, I found these dark grey pieces nonetheless make excellent track for the 12V trains. The sideways tab-clips connect the long rail sections but block standard building where studs would otherwise be, which is probably necessary. The track rails are a good invention are still around in modern sets sometimes. They can break or weaken with rough play or a lack of care and should really be kept out of larger bits boxes to ensure their survival. I am unaware of their use for trains outside 12V but I'm sure experimentation will answer this. As with many other complete sets you can build an oval, circular or start to end railway. A number of railway layouts are shown in the manual for combination with track accessory sets. A useful but flimsy signal on a tall red post attaches to our track with a device to change travel direction, flipping the battery box switch. Its clever but the signal plastic is very thin and I would list this as a flaw, built components always providing more sound engineering.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Coal Black &amp; Fire Red</b></div><div>The train chassis, here in typical red, is not something that seems necessary as a one piece part and could surely be built. That said it is a bespoke design to fit the engine motor perfectly and has couplers and formation to best suggest train bodywork. The excellent Lego magnets are present via centrally held clips that hold them in each end for highly effective engine to carriage to wagon link up. Cylindrical bricks, plates and ladders are added to fill out more red chassis before the black bodywork forms in a more standard range of bricks and slants with headlamps front and rear. A nice dials print slant is present for the interior. The electrical cable plugs in and can hang out the back for the moment. The steam engine is a heavy and sturdy build mostly from the motor block but also from a solid build of thick bricks and a pleasant representation of the cylindrical central shape of a steam engine. Black tubes also form cabling down the sides and the windows are well chosen in appearance with those comfortably solid train doors with more push in window panes. There's a suitable yellow bell, the top of the boiler is slanted nicely but the sandbox (had to learn my train part names for this) is usually round and could easily have been cylindered but is a simply cuboid. The steam dome is contrastingly great in the surprising form of a plain black minifigure head! The smokebox chimney is then again sadly meagre and lacking but you can see how they wanted red rings on black. Its a squat affair but with less functional form that is not possible in every single train set; no side rods for instance, with just two small red wheels suitably rubber lined for grip. It is a good build with very likeable outcome as are many of the steam trains but not the best by any other means. Now add the fiddly weight capacity and 'DB' badge stickers, not for everyone.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Fossil Fuel Back Up</b></div><div>The battery box is not so much a coal tender but but more a red box wagon that comes almost complete with black chassis and wheels but grey plates, double sloped roof sections, tiles and black couplers have to be added. Its overly long on/off switch seems a bit thin for my liking and could be snapped off if dropped as the box is heavy when full of batteries.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Well Oiled</b></div><div>Next up is a black wagon which gets a proper build of couplers, bricks, alternating plates and train wheel blocks added. That old favourite Shell oil gets transported on this wagon with some great fuel barrels in the Shell colours sat on grey plate pallets and held in check with some low red barriers.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Rail Mail</b></div><div>The black wagon base build is done slightly differently again with slants making more of a design underneath. This is the post wagon and comes highly recommended if you want to get one without having to pay out for the larger and far too competitively sought after version. This smart red and yellow post office on wheels gets a blue desk and even a swivel chair, these being too rarely implemented. A parcel sits on the floor and an envelope on the desk all for sorting. The brilliant doors return in half red and yellow or is one of those colours a print? The windows adjoin to the upper yellow build layer and the double side rail plates are for the excellent sliding red wagon doors. Trans-red side lights feature just low of another grey roof much like the battery box and looks very decent. The post sticker is a pain but looks great. A small platform build of light grey plates and black slopes holds a pallet of mail which happily fits the mail wagon. It was good that something like this was included for load and unload interaction but it is a cargo train after all.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Loader Proper</b></div><div>Where as modern instructions usually show the small build first, here it is last in the form of a blue forklift cargo truck. Its well built, chunky and has a special working mechanism that flexes on hinges for lifting pallets of mail or fuel. Lights and levers sit up front by the driver and its larger front wheels make a pretty realistic design utilising a number of slants, black bars and a couple of grill prints. Is it me or does the Trains theme seem to regularly contain higher quality and thought out out features? The driver's held protectively well in a grey seat, able to control the truck to tow a blue trailer connecting with a ball and socket join. The trailer gets steerable front wheels with a turntable and just the bottom plate halves of 2.5 stud long hinges that cleverly hold pallets in place.</div><h4><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">						</span>Alternative Building</h4><div>Quite astonished, I never realised that instructions were provided for an alternative build and it is rather good: A Postal Service diesel engine thats tows a flatter, shuttered compartment mail wagon, a cargo wagon with black guard box and a mini blue fuel truck. These are all a really good effort and good choices. The instructions then display how, when built with set&nbsp;</div><div><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7865-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7865-1</a>&nbsp;the engine gets a motor and set of wheels with side rods to help build a really great little engine but I think its wrong to make a further purchase 'upgrade' when this should really be included. Perhaps its considered a more advanced section for older kids.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Basic Engineering</b></div><div>This is a good all round train set that is a basic 12V kit for a first Lego train set or for a younger child. It matters not which push along, battery or mains set you get as they almost all add something special to a Town or country landscape design. Particular fun is had no doubt with loading and unloading, directional control and the endless interaction with just so many other sets, models and people. Fuel and mail seems a risky combination on a cargo train but these are excellent choices, the barrels and parcels perfect for any child's or inner child's transportation scenarios. A fine but more broadly unremarkable engine within the range but a very worthwhile mail wagon. Recommended as a good starter or additional postal service expansion set.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
"fruitbat","2010-01-26T17:55:19.357Z","hours of fun","I got this train when I was about 7 or 8. I shortly thereafter got a large station to go with it and lots of extra track to make sidings etc. It was a wonderful toy which I spent hours playing with - running the train, operating the signals and points and reverse-posts. I also got the level crossing and we bought a tunnel (not lego) which we adapted to allow my train through. The little letters, the cargo and the fork-lift made the hours of fun endless. The train is cute and the mail carriage really good. My only regrets was that it never came with a passenger car and we never found one to add to it which made my station very difficult to explain. In addition the tracks had to be put on a hard flat surface for the train to be strong enough to run. (We nailed rails to plywood). After about 10 years of play with it, it was revelantly retired to a box in the attic and only 4 days ago was it unearthed by my parents and dropped off for my 5-year old stepson to play with. Despite its age, extensive use and moving across the Atlantic twice and house numbers of times - with a fresh set of batteries my train is ready to chug again (as soon as the tracks are laid flat). As a girl I made a holiday resort out of my lego of which the post train was the only means for the tourists to visit... from there the fun began! I am looking forward to see what my stepson makes of it! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Koromo","2010-11-06T11:49:23.077Z","First Train Set.","<p>I remember getting this train set for christmas as a kid.&nbsp; I had asked one&nbsp;year for the Futuron Monorail but got this one instead that year or the year after.&nbsp; I was more of a fan of the space theme but this set was just as fun, and I realized much later, alot less expensive and easier to find than the Monorail set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I built this one with my Dad under the tree and later moved it to on top of the pool table which became the best layout surface ever.&nbsp; My parents also bought that same year&nbsp;the straight, curved and switch track packs&nbsp;so I could have a different layout.&nbsp; This was a major advantage over the monorail as regular track was more affordable for expansion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The black locomotive had a great design and I always perferred the classic steam engine look than the boxy diesels.&nbsp; The container car was simple enough, and could also carry other cargo with constuction of a pallet for the forklift to use, those m-tron crates for example.&nbsp; The forklift itself was really neat and later had service in the space base I worked on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mail truck was unique and could hold more than just the mail of course.&nbsp; The parts and colour scheme were repurposed in the alternate instructions for a red and yellow locomotive.&nbsp; The alternate instructions were great for a completely different train set up.&nbsp; Some time later I was able to design a space-theme locomotive and cars, though I couldn't do much about the red battery box.&nbsp; The M-tron magnets found a way of becoming couplers for an extended train.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original design is what I settle on when I have&nbsp;rebuilt the kit. Though I haven't in a long time,&nbsp; I wouldn't part with it given the memories&nbsp;had with it.&nbsp; It was unique and the last of its kind, when trains went to metal on track designs.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Crazy_Chris","2017-11-30T18:15:46.517Z","Battery power","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1985<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: train starter set (entry level / battery operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7720<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
This set has been the last battery operated train (besides Duplo) for many years, until the RC train technology was released in 2006. It looks as if in 1985, Lego wanted to avoid the usage red 12v motors. Therefore, the two low-end starter sets became steam engines, while the two 12v starter sets were modern engines where black motors were possible.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
This steam engine uses some space parts in order to add some nice details. And as the 4.5v motor doesn&#39;t allow to use center wheels, this is the only steam engine that has only 2 axles. This is covered by the smart usage of two round red 1x1 bricks at each side. That&#39;s a good idea and can be re-used, especially if you want to upgrade the engines from 7710 or 7715 with a 4.5v motor.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
The first wagon is always the battery car, which was upgraded and unique to this set: magnets and wheels have changed to black color, what gives it a more integrated look.<br />
The second wagon is a flatbed car that carries some shell-lookalike fuel barrels.<br />
Finally, there is a small mail car with sliding doors, it comes in the well-known yellow-red color scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
There is a loading station with ramp, which is intended to load/unload the mail car. Moreover, there is a big forklift with trailer that works on the flatbed wagon.<br />
The track is a complete circle with a total of four straight sections.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
Early versions of the set use hinge plates with solid studs, while later versions use hinge plates with hollow studs.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
That&#39;s a nice little cargo train with good playability. Like its predecessor, it doesn&#39;t run fast, but steadily.</p>

"naf","2013-11-13T13:11:05.47Z","Brings me back to my childhood.","This set was a total surprise for me on Christmas morning, I think it was 1986.&nbsp; I was a huge Lego fan, but was mostly into the space theme, and wasn't aware of everything Lego had to offer.&nbsp; A fully working motorized train was definitely not on my radar.&nbsp; The train is absolutely beautiful, the black, yellow, and red colors are very vibrant.&nbsp; The engine itself is very sturdy, and heavy thanks to the motor.&nbsp; Lego did a good job of giving the engine a rounded look given the limited selection of parts in the 80's.&nbsp; The red box car is a single piece that holds the batteries.&nbsp; No getting around this with a 4.5v system.&nbsp; The next car is a flatbed that holds two pallets of barrels.&nbsp; The final car is a mail wagon that has a two large sliding cargo doors, a place to store packages, and a desk for the mail employee to sit.&nbsp; Very nice looking wagon done in yellow and red bricks.<br><br>The set includes a nice brick built forklift and loading platform that adds to the playability of the set.&nbsp; There is enough track to make a big oval, and it includes a signal piece that stops and starts the train, and also two pieces that will trip the switch and reverse the direction of the train.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Great value, I think this was $50 or $60 in the 80's, which is great for a fully working train with track right out of the box.<br>- Ease of use.&nbsp; The 4.5v system is an under-appreciated Lego train technology.&nbsp; It works great, is robust, and a kid could get this built and running in a few hours.&nbsp; No need for special controls or tracks.&nbsp; Since the track doesn't have to be built to conduct electricity, you can expand your layout relatively cheaply.<br>- This set is really two models in one.&nbsp; The main build is the black steam locomotive, but you also get instructions for building a yellow and red diesel engine.<br>- Built to last, the motor still runs 30+ years later.<br><br>Cons:<br>- The red signal piece is delicate and is prone to breaking.&nbsp; Mine has been superglued a few times.<br>- The track pieces are delicate and will break if stepped on.&nbsp; I would keep this stored in a box away from your other Lego pieces when not in use.<br>- The red box car is a ""wasted"" car since it offers no playable functions, but it is necessary in the 4.5v system to house the batteries.<br>- I wish they had included a coal tender with this set.&nbsp; The cable is long enough that you could fit one between the engine and battery box with the cable going through the tender.&nbsp; I ended up building one from spare pieces, but it would have been nice to include in the set.<br><br>I personally love this set and feel that it is an under appreciated beauty.&nbsp; It brings back fond memories of my childhood whenever I build it, and I'm glad I still have it to share with my children.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have this train winding through my display of sets from the Winter Village series, the steam train matches the 1950's Christmas vibe perfectly.<br>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,5
