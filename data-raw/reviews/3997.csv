"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-30T14:02:13Z","My favourite train set ever","This passenger train is simply great, even though there is only one motorman in it and no passengers sit in the wagons!
The locomotive an the rear wagon both have those cool front windows everyone loves plus some rare red roof parts.
The overall design is nothing short than a 10 as there are no shoddy space parts used for this set (save the computers).
The three carriages are not too heavy in weight and the train drives pretty fast.
If you get the chance to still grab it somewhere don't be reluctant!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T02:06:04Z","Nice looking train","I like this set too. Infact an electric short train, instead a steamengine. I've not the original, but I build this train in blue. See link: http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=99830

Even second hand is this one a little too expensive, that's why I build this set in a different color.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I have a bigture from the christmas when I got this set, I think it's quite funny today, because I was able to sit in the middle of the circle track, and watch as the train ran around me :-D.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Year of release: 1981<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: train starter set (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.5<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
One year after the initial release of the new system, this set is an addendum to the range of 12v starter sets. Compared to 7730 and 7740, you had to pay less money, but the set was reduced to the minimum of required parts: only one single minifig, only a circled track without straight sections, many basic bricks. Even the seats are placed on square 2x2 plates, while all passenger seats from other passenger cars are placed on round 2x2 plates.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
Basically, it is just a motor with a boxed cab on top of it. It looks like a shrinked and mono-colored version of 7740, and it is THE set to be equipped with the lights kit 7861.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
There are two passenger cars, but one of them looks like the leading engine, just without the motor. As usual with passenger trains, there are lots of doors and windows. And of course, the roofs can be removed.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
The track is a complete circle with no straight sections.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
It is unclear whether this set if affected by the different versions of the sleeper plates or not. The same applies to the conducting rails with or without holes.<br />
For powering, most likely only the curved conducting rail with holes, but without cable, was used for this set.<br />
Moreover, at least two different versions of the 12v motor are possible. It is unclear if the set was also equipped with the very first version of the motor.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
It&#39;s all very basic, it is reduced as much as possible. Nevertheless, it looks pretty good and charming. It appears that it was a success, related to the target of being an easy entry into the 12v world.</p>

"Lego12vFan","2009-04-25T23:55:03.717Z","Great 12v train","My second 12v train set after 7740. Although its shorter, I like it a lot. At some point I tried adding an additional car but it looked funny and out of balance. It looks complete and cute with only three cars, just the way it is. It is very easy to add light prisms with holders to the head and rear end, as well as light bricks in all the three cars, all of which makes the train glow as it rolls. Nice red color, not as heavy as 7740 so it goes much faster. Great set, very fun to watch run.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PeteM","2015-02-18T17:40:28.317Z","The Little Starter Set That Could...","<p>Released the year after the &lsquo;Grey Era&rsquo; of the 12v train system launched, this latecomer to the party nonetheless fulfils a vital function &ndash; that of the basic starter set for the range. It includes everything required for the 12v system (well, very nearly) but with a much lower piece count and price than the range flagship, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">#7740 InterCity</a>.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are the usual A4 booklet style and are fairly slim &ndash; not surprising when the front cover alone manages to cram on a picture of the set, how to put the minifig together and the first two steps of the build!</p>

<p>Having exactly 13 steps to build each of the carriages has a pleasing symmetry but, apart from freaking out triskaidekaphobics, they are otherwise unremarkable.&nbsp;Common to that era,&nbsp;it proceeds at quite a pace &ndash; in&nbsp;fact the main build takes up only half the instruction book, with the other half featuring an unusually elaborate secondary model: a rather blocky steam engine, tender and caboose, complete with passenger platform.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are the usual array of train-specific pieces, including the 12v motor unit, couplers, wheels, doors, track and power rails and the moulded glass windows which were introduced in the previous years train sets. Apart from those, there&rsquo;s an unexciting selection of basic bricks and plates in red and black, and grey roof pieces to round out the set.</p>

<p>As with all of the 12v sets, the transformer control unit which actually gets the thing going has to be bought separately &ndash; ultimately logical as it kept the price of the individual sets lower and ensured that collectors didn&rsquo;t end up with loads of the things (they were bulky and heavy, and there was no eBay in 1980!), but it is a bit of a blow out-of-the-box playability.</p>

<h3>Minifigure (singular)</h3>

<p>The only minifigure included in the set is the standard train driver, resplendent in his blue suit and tie and red flat cap. I&rsquo;m not usually hugely bothered by minifigs, but a couple more to actually sit in the carriages would have been most welcome, unless recreating the adventures of an out of service train was a regular play highlight&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure most kids would have had extra figures from other sets to utilise, but even in a &lsquo;budget&rsquo; set it still seems a bit stingy.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward and, with three small carriage units to construct and most of the structure taken up with windows and doors, it feels fairly rapid. Repetition is kept to a minimum as the units at either end are constructed slightly differently &ndash; the &lsquo;front engine&rsquo; housing the motor requires the use of two weighted bricks which are two studs wide each and so reduces the space inside the carriage, whereas the &lsquo;back engine&rsquo; requires the construction of a mock motor bogie and is able to include more seats, albeit sadly devoid of any actual passengers (see above).</p>

<p>There are a couple of small mini-builds along the way, most notably the pantographs which are constructed in the same way as on #7740 and are similarly rickety and prone to being knocked out of shape.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The end result is very pleasing &ndash; a simple three-carriage train in a striking red colour scheme. Despite being relatively small in size, the set evokes a small suburban train shuttle service very well, and its lack of weight means that it really whizzes&nbsp;along when you crank the power up. There was only a basic circle of track included, though as the train itself is quite short, this isn&rsquo;t too much of an issue (and in those days, extra straight track could easily be bought by itself &ndash; take note, TLG!).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>On first glance, it is difficult to see past this set as anything more than a budget #7740, but the shortened stubby one-colour carriages do actually have a charm all of their of their own. I&rsquo;ve seen examples where extra and/or lengthened carriages have been added and it just doesn&rsquo;t look right.</p>

<p>The only noticeable disappointment is the severe lack of minifigures which does affect the playability &ndash; anyone who buys this hoping to recreate the stifling uncomfortable conditions enjoyed by travellers on any the UK&rsquo;s suburban rail franchises is sadly out of luck&hellip;</p>

<p>However, despite being rather uninspiring on paper (and even on the box, thanks to a rather dull picture), it perfectly manages the tricky dual role of being both a wonderful starter set (especially as numerous accessories and add-ons were plentiful at the time) as well as being able to fit nicely&nbsp;into an existing layout.&nbsp;It may be small, but its boxy and slightly basic appearance is effortlessly reminiscent of&nbsp;a small rapid suburban rail network&nbsp;and, on its own terms, easily stands its ground against larger, longer models. Small, but mighty!</p>

"yellowsubmarine","2020-12-13T19:15:54.987Z","Traditional train set ","<p>This one was one of my first maybe my first ever LEGO set. And what an awesome one it is. From that moment on i was hooked to LEGO and trains.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>Unfortunately I do not really remember building that set. I received this as a christmas present back in 1983 or 1984.&nbsp;I think it was already build up by on one my cousins.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>There are windows, a lot of windows. And there are simple bricks. Red bricks. The front windows on first and last wagon are huge and quite unique for the 1980&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>The playability is limited. There is only one minifigure included, no additional station or function.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>What i really like are the extensions you could add to this set with a little creativity. Adding a light system for front and rear wagon would limit the accessibility and stick the wagons together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking of the roof in one piece is great. You can get easy access to the interieur with yellow seats for passengers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet a simple set and build but so great to use your own fantasy to have great time with basic bricks.</p>
