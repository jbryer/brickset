Year of release: 1983<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: train starter set (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 2.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7730<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7735</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
In 1983, the second wave of train sets was released. All train starter sets except set 7730 were continued. At first glance, this set looks similar to its predecessor. But in detail, there are some new parts (e.g. the 6x6 roof elements and the sliding doors) that provide a modernized look. This set was the third - and last - to come with a red 12v motor. It is the train starter set with the shortest selling period. Therefore, it is hard to find (especially when you are looking for a complete box in good condition) and highly sought after.</p>

<p>Locomotive<br />
Another steam engine, again somewhat different in design. The flexible hoses were also used in space sets and provide a unique style. Adding the 7861 lights kit is possible, but will clearly change the look of the front.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
Two of the three wagons are strictly identical, but they transport different types of freight: a small buggy (same design as the buggy from station 7824), a container, and other stuff. The third wagon comes with the big sliding doors, which were absolutely new in 1983.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
There is a big forklift with an improved mechanism (however, the spring often gets lost). And the track is a circle with two additional straight sections.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
It is most likely, that this set was released with two different variants of the red motor.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
I guess that the Lego authorities felt that 7730 was a little bit outdated, so they decided to release an improved version. They did well, but it wouldn&#39;t last for long until 7727 would vanish from the shelves. It is a kind of funny fact, that some 1983 sets have been sold for only two years, while other 1983 sets lasted until the end in 1990.</p>
