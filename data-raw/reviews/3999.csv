The frigo wagon is almost a remake of set 147 that was brought out in 1977. I was lucky to obtain this rare set in an auction for a good price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1982<br />
Set type: train starter set (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7727</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
When the new system was introduced in 1980, this was the smaller of the two 12v train starter sets. It was the first of only three sets that came with the red 12v motor.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
Compared to set 7710, the steam locomotive is more advanced: is has doors, is has a motor, it doesn&#39;t look so basic. All in all, it is obvious that Lego wanted to provide variety, even if things looked similar at first glance. The lights kit 7861 can be installed without problems.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
There are three different wagons, all of them rather basic but with good playability. The refrigerated wagon is an upgraded version of set 147.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
The track is a complete circle with an additional total of two straight sections. The set also contains a working forklift, but no platform or ramp.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
This set comes either with the first (767) or second (4166) version of the dark gray sleeper plates.<br />
There are also different versions of the conducting rails (with or without holes) and powering rails (most likely, straight for 1980 and curved for 1981 and 1982).<br />
It is unclear if this set is affected by the three different versions of the red 12v motor. Most likely, this set was released with at least two different versions of it.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This set was a basic entry into the 12v world, therefore it surely was a very important element of the product range. But it is not as iconic as its successor 7727 or as the famous 7740.</p>
