"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-16T14:06:54Z","Got it...","I almost regret buying this set because of the price but the quality of it makes it perfect. BOX: 8/10 - When you buy it, the box will come in black and white. Not as good as good as the original Metroliner box, though... PIECES: 10/10 - A lot of unique pieces and accessory like the cart, suitcases mail package, bikes, and cool minifigures. The platform is a wonderful thing. PLAYABILITY: 9/10 - Loses 1 point for no speed regulator. When I first got it, I had to use a transformer and plug it directly into the plug. No speed control. Combine with 10002 is good but the train loses friction. I had to put a bunch of quarter in the engine to make it go! OVERALL: 10/10 - Great set and great playability is a must-have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-18T15:46:38Z","A great set!","It is very good that LEGO re-released this classic train, but it isn't the same Metroliner from 1991 because it hasn't has the same pieces. For the first: The originally Metroliner had printed stripes on the doors on the two locomotives. And for the second: No pigtail hair. The third no minifigures stud solids head. The fourth no originally instructions. The fifth no originally box. The sixth: It should have a stud solid white panel in the passenger car. And for the seventh it should have others sticker sheets. And it's because that I'll give it a 9, but it is still a nice train, and still a classic Metroliner! I love it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

In set 10001 there is...
...one ponytail hair though it should be hair with pigtails.
...a timetable sticker with a typing error: it says &quot;Z&#252;ric&quot; instead of &quot;Z&#252;rich&quot;. I don't know if the original (4558) also had this error.
...a white panel 1x2x3 which has hollow studs though they should be solid. 
...four gray train doors 1x5x4 that do not have print on them. You must use stickers instead.
...four window glasses for the train window 1x2x3 are transparent light blue instead of clear. 
...minifigs' heads that are hollow.

The reasons given above made me rate it 4 instead of 5. 

For set 10001 I use two 9V motors. When you add Railroad Club Car 4547/10002, it is quite slow with only one. So I have one motor in the front section and one at the end part. However, the train looks great, no matter if you have 10001 or the original set. What I find good is that there are four straight rails included. This is necessary; otherwise there would not be enough space for the platform. Of course, you get many minifigs. And the locomotive has a working light, but it doesn't have one at its back. 

This set is ideal to start with 9V trains, but it is quite expensive and a speed regulator is not included. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Mr_Hobbles","2008-08-26T18:39:11.81Z","The Best LEGO Train to Date","I bought this a while back when I had just come out of my dark ages.  I saw this set and remembered that this was one I had always wanted as a kid but could never afford.  My parents were the type that bought me small &#163;5-10 sets!

Getting this as an AFOL was really a treat.  The build is extremely enjoyable as you work your way through the carriages, putting in details such as engines and control panels, and tables and wash basins.  The platform isn't anything special but it does the job, although you'd be better off getting one of the new stations to go with it.

The surprising thing is that this set has stood the test of time.  Unlike many classic sets, this does not look out of place with anything LEGO has released in the last couple of years.  It completely compliments Cafe Corner and Market Street, and looks the part next to the Garbage Truck and Concrete Mixer.  You won't even notice the slightly different grey unless you look hard!

I only have one complaint about this set, and that is that they didn't bother to put working red taillights in the rear of the train.  Not that hard to do though, and it does wonders for the overall aesthetics!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
