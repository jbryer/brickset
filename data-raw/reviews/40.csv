It is a must for any fan who like to create from bulk bricks or buckets. One can never have enough windows when construction begings on a house or condo or hotel. I have only seen this set available in a few of the catalogs, so you must really look to catch it. Great set ! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

So if you have a load of bulk standard bricks, you must have one of these so you can make realistic houses.

I got a couple of extra copies to give to my nephews/nieces, as these are the bits that don't often come with sets.

Only downside is that its not as good as the 'windows &amp; doors pack it replaces'.  For those that don't remember the older set, it had opening plain glass doors (left &amp; right) for shop entrances etc.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
