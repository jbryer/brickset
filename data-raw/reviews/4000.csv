4 train carriages! Not 3 like other models!  You can easily modify one or both of the middle ones to another design of your choice.  I like the shell &quot;tank&quot;, and the motorcycles sit nicely on those 1x2 tiles with studs on the other carriage.  The train is done in a lovely yellow design (my favourite colour!), and the back carriage has 2 nice sliding doors! It also has 2 of those very nice  yellow train windows.   

As if all the face value stuff and silver box weren't enough to tempt a person to buy this set, the instructions feature the following: 
1 alternative front train carriage (VERY NICE ONE!)
2 alternative pulled carriages (better than nothing)
an alternative vehicle! (very nice too!)
1 alternative platforum (why did they bother? lol)

The instructions with alternative designs and track layouts really make this set an essential train set.  The train even goes backwards, and pulls 90's style lego trains!!

I had wondered whether to give this set a 10 or not, but it has some major downsides: only 2 figures for such a big set, and the 2 middle carriages aren't much to look at.  Even if you modify them to look better, that's still extra pieces you need to get.  You really need another lego train set to accompany this one for it to fit in to your collection. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T16:06:04Z","Cool Shunting Loco","The reason I don't give this set a ten are the two smaller wagons. Somehow they lack detail and show a bit of poor design. Nothing against the cool post? wagon, though!!
Once on rails you'll discover that it's fairly long. And boy that small locomotive could tow ten wagons.
Oh yeah, the alternative model resembles somewhat of a tram and looks very nice (The glorious Red Electric Passenger Train comes to mind). The wagons are lame on the contrary. In the past I could never decide which locomotive to build.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T16:19:25Z","Shorttrack","A nice freight train with a diesel loc. Its predecessors 7727 en 7730 are steamtrains. I like the loc itself. It has the same coler pattern as 7740. There is an great alternative plan for a small version of the 7740 loc! The design of the mailwagon is great. The yellow color matches other mail sets. The two other wagons are nice but I like the mailwagon the best.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Crazy_Chris","2017-11-30T18:17:21.18Z","A 12v freight train without steam engine","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1985<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: train starter set (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7727<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
This set is the first and only 12v grey era freight train that does NOT come with a steam engine. Instead, a modern-styled diesel engine carries three load wagons.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
In the german catalog, it is described as &quot;Hercules Engine&quot;. It looks as if this name was invented by Lego, because I cannot find something like this in the world of real trains. After 7740 and 7722, this is the third use of the yellow-red color scheme. Adding the lights kit 7861 is possible, but makes the engine look really odd.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
There are two flatbed cars with various goods: two motorbikes, a big fuel barrel, a small fuel truck. And there is a yellow mail car with sliding doors and standard train doors. Until now, the yellow train doors were ever only used in this set.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
As usual, there is a small loading station with ramp. The track is a circle with two additional straight sections.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are different versions of the conducting rails: Either with or without holes, but always with additional reinforcements at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
A fresh style, this is what comes to my mind when looking at this set. Another proof that Lego wanted to provide variety. According to today&#39;s availability, it must have been a huge success in selling figures.</p>
