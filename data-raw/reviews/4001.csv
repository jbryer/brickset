As you can see from the prices this commands on Bricklink, this is one of the greatest Lego train sets ever made. It is all the more remarkable for the fact that it was released in 1980. Years ahead of its time.<br />
<br />
The loco and carriages are sturdy and well designed, and still look well in place on a modern layout - even with the non-articulated pantographs. There are also a healthy number of minifigs (admittedly very plainly-dressed) included. The little platform has become a Lego standard in sets of this type.<br />
<br />
Any serious train builder will combine this set with the mail car and sleeper carriages released separately for a very slick, authentically German-looking, 4 car train. The set also converts very easily to operate on the 9 volt system, although the lighting can pose a bit of a problem.<br />
<br />
This set is a great addition to any Lego collection!</p>

"Lego12vFan","2009-04-26T16:36:19.09Z","Fantastic set - king of the 12v gray-track era!","This is one of the top all-time classic Lego train sets. It was the very first 12v train set I owned and is still in great shape and runs perfectly well. 

Being such a classic set obviously there is a lot to say about it. I believe this was the first 12v set that sort of inaugurated the so called ""gray era"" of Lego trains (along with the set 7730.) It is also noteworthy because it is one of the few 12v passenger train sets Lego ever introduced, along with 7725 and 7745. 

I find the engine to be the most interesting part of this 3-piece set. It represents the no-nonsense, clean design philosophy of the 1980's Lego trains. It is very nicely proportioned, and beautiful to look at. It accomplishes a great job by using mostly standard Lego bricks. The choice of 2x2 gray and yellow square windows on the sides, as well as the flat pieces used to form the pantographs are good examples of using such standard bricks available at the time. 

The fantastic color scheme obviously makes this set stand out among the others. Little 1x2 red plates between the roof line and the pantographs is another example of simple yet interesting design features of the set. 

The engine also comes with head and rear end light prisms and prism holders and light bricks, which I guess must have been a big selling point at the time. The lights add drama and curiosity to the set. 

Also worth mentioning is the dining car with its own pantograph at the rear end--a wonderful touch, which completes the set beautifully. And don't miss the chef with his big white hat behind the counter waiting to serve his customers!

With the addition of 7815 and 7819, which I believe are meant to complete this set, 7740 becomes even more beautiful and interesting.

Finally, even if it might sound a little exaggerated, one can easily claim that 7740 is probably the king of the 12v gray era train sets!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Crazy_Chris","2017-11-28T18:30:35.243Z","A true flagship","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: train starter set (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7745</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
When the new system was introduced in 1980, this was the flagship set. A huge passenger train, equipped with lights and lots of minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
Thanks to the new (from 1980s perspective) 6x28 baseplate, it is huge. And it looks different than any other train engines of the new system. It has lights, a dummy engine, and the roof can be removed. The yellow and red color scheme makes it look special, but it was re-used in later sets (7722 and 7735).</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
There are two passenger cars, but in contrast to 7710, they are different: the first one is a pure passenger car, while the second one has a small dining section. Both use the same baseplate as the locomotive does.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
The track is a complete circle with an additional total of six straight sections. The set also contains a big station platform for the minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
This set comes either with the first (767) or second (4166) version of the dark gray sleeper plates.<br />
There are also different versions of the conducting rails (with or without holes) and powering rails (most likely, straight for 1980 and curved for 1981 until 1984).<br />
The 12v motor was repetitively revised during the first production years, therefore this set can contain one of three different versions of the 12v motor. In a similar way, this applies to the lighting bricks, where two different versions exist.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
It&#39;s a flagship, and it&#39;s a highlight. It&#39;s a must-have for every collector of the grey 12v era.</p>

"gert","2012-11-09T16:01:40.363Z","first big minifig train","<p>For me it's a real classic from my childhood and as for so many AFOL's from that era it's hard to be objective about it. train's from the blue-era are not compatible with the minifigs. the first passenger trains that could hold minifigs where the 7710 en 7715 in&nbsp;their nice little wagons. And then there was this 7740 wich was double the size !! with very large wagons. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>nice &amp; clear. pictures of an alternative build as a goods-train</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>all regular bricks, some in a less common color.</p><p>I love the trin windows and train doors. they a realy suitable for the minifigs. these type of doors was still present in de later passengertrains . just missing them in recent emerald night wagons and holiday express.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>lot of passangers , driver and cook. </p><p>as for all minifigs of these day's many plain blue &amp; red parts</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>easy to build. with some extra windows &amp; doors (even other colors) it's easy to make a similar wagon that fits the train. if you don't have extra windows you can add a post/cargo wagon in same colorscheme without the need for special parts.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>superb train at the time, motivation to make larger circuit.</p><p>now we've seen the larger santa-fe, I like to add&nbsp;some extra wagons to make it an impressive train again on a large track.</p><p>I added&nbsp; pf-battery in postal wagon to conseil it, but you can alse&nbsp;put&nbsp;it in the locomotive.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>nice train, loved by me because i enjoyed it in my childhood. little overpriced this time&nbsp; it's not worth €$ 300 or €$ 400. I searched the internet for 2 years now an can say you will find a complete train for 150 to 200 €$ max. A single wagon (like 7815) should go for 40 to 50 €$.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,3
"RapidAssistant","2023-01-03T00:23:00.067Z","Perhaps the most iconic 12V Lego train of all","<p>I&#39;ve owned 7740 three times, the first time as a child in the 1980s, again as an investment in the 2000s and again as an AFOL in the 2020s.&nbsp; It is one of those Lego sets that any fan of the legendary &quot;grey era&quot; 12V system must have and whilst the 7750 steam locomotive set challenges it as the most desirable 12V train set, there is no doubt 7740 is the most iconic of them all!</p>

<p>The set itself was released in 1980, although some markets (such as the UK) didn&#39;t get it until &#39;81.&nbsp; Was the flagship set of the new generation 12V system and was loosely based on a West German ICE train of the 1960s/1970s.&nbsp; &nbsp;The locomotive is well detailed, has a mock engine and working lights powered from the motor .&nbsp; The two coaches consist of a passenger car and a restaurant car (&quot;Speisewagen&quot;).&nbsp; Originally it came with a sticker set that allowed you to decorate it in the livery of your own country&#39;s rail network, but most people will probably just keep the default Deutsche Bahn (DB) livery.&nbsp; There is also a little station platform to get you started (but you&#39;ll probably want 7822 or 7824 eventually!)</p>

<p>The loco and coaches are designed with roof sections that come off easily without destroying the rest of the model (1x8 tiles are used so only a limited number of studs hold the roof sections on), so you can access the inside and move the 10 supplied minifigures around.</p>

<p>Two sets (7815 and 7819) - respectively a sleeper car and a mail wagon were sold as expansion packs for 7740, although they do slow the train down considerably and you may want to invest in a second motor to the locomotive to haul it all around.</p>

<p>Today the biggest problem is that 7740 is a highly sought after set; like most of the classic 12V Lego Trains they are not cheap on the second hand market and are rapidly appreciating.&nbsp; Good condition examples start at &pound;250 (GBP) upwards, with pristine ones still with a mint box closer to &pound;300-&pound;350.&nbsp; Unopened and unbuilt examples (if you can find one!) have been known to change hands for up to &pound;2000!</p>

<p>You can get lucky and pick up broken/neglected/incomplete 7740s for &pound;100-&pound;150 on eBay, but factor in the cost of the bespoke pieces (motor, light bricks, windows, doors, baseplates, bogies) if they are missing or broken.&nbsp; Most Bricklink vendors know the value of these components and are therefore priced accordingly, so a restoration project could be costly!!&nbsp;</p>
