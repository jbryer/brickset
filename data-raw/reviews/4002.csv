"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T15:57:12Z","","Dude, I was so proud when I received this set as a kid. The engines are designed really nice as in all the 80s train sets. It also came with lots of rails and was a the biggest mid-eighties set in general. The cool clear front windows were new at the time as well.
The box was also a ten, I remember a kid just finishing the precious locomotive displayed in one of the pics.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"eviste","2011-03-26T19:05:08.26Z","High Speed, High Fun!","I managed to acquire this set in the late 90's after resurrecting my old 12/ 4.5v Lego and have since gone on to build another one from spare parts...it's really that good! ha ha. It always reminded me of a British Inter City 125 (well kind of). It comes with front and end lights, plenty of minifigs (including the cool chef) and a decent sized platform. The detail is really very good from the sink and taps in the carriage to the engines in the cab. Despite it's size it pulls pretty well round the tracks too. I definitely recommend this train and is pretty much reasonable to find one for a decent price compared to some of the other 12v train sets.<br>",TRUE,2,5,5,5,4

Year of release: 1985<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: train starter set (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7740<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>General description</strong><br />
The flagship set of the year 1985. Back in those days, high-speed trains like the TGV and ICE were THE big thing. Lego was very up to date with this set. And it was really expensive, nearly as twice as the technic flagship 8860 car chassis.</p>

<p><strong>Locomotive</strong><br />
Like its predecessor 7740, the engine is based on the huge 6x28 baseplate. The red color with white stripes was a new scheme, but later it was re-used in some 9v sets (4563 and 4551). The engine is equipped with lights, and the cables are looped through the complete train. The big transparent windscreen pieces (formerly used in space sets and as roof elements for town buildings) provide an arrow-like look. There are fake engines behind shutters, the pantographs were design using hinges, and the front has container-cupboards that are re-used as utensils&#39; storage.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons</strong><br />
The passenger car is built quite straightforward, while the dining car is a copy of the engine, just without motor. The cables are hidden as good as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Other contents</strong><br />
The track is a complete circle with an additional total of six straight sections. The set also contains a big station platform for the minifigs. The platform has two light posts, but they are not lightened.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are different versions of the conducting rails: Either with or without holes, but always with additional reinforcements at the bottom.<br />
Moreover, early versions of the set use hinge plates with solid studs, while later versions use hinge plates with hollow studs.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
A true flagship set, and a perfect reference to the 1980s &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;.</p>

"Lego12vFan","2011-12-19T20:06:11.41Z","One of the backbones of Lego trains along with 7740 and 7725","This is one of the four 12v sets that I consider as the backbone of my collection, and one of my favorites. The other three sets are 7740, 7725 and 7735.<br><br>The more recent passenger trains 7898 (RC) and 7938 (Power Functions) are both newer iterations of this set, as they have a similar 3-unit design consisting of almost identical head and rear-end units with a middle car in between, however they do not come anywhere near 7745 in terms of their design sensibility. <br><br>Obviously I am very partial to the 12v era but in my opinion even the 9v so-called Metroliner 4558 does not match up to the 7745. I think what turns me off about the Metroliner is its blunt head and rear, and the mousy gray &amp; black overall color scheme, which end up creating a very boxy look. (Personally I don't believe any 9v train design can ever match up to those of the 12v era, which might be a little bit of an exaggeration, but that's a completely different discussion anyway.)<br><br>Back to 7745: In line with the Lego design philosophy of the 80s, mostly regular bricks or their color variations are used in the construction of 7745, and yet there is great attention to detail. The engine is concealed behind black window shutters in the head-end of the train. Red sloping bricks that you'd normally see on a rooftop help form the nose, and two clear sloping bricks of the same angle continue higher to form the windshield of the engine. It is this simple yet thoughtful and minimal elegance which makes 7745 such a unique and timeless piece of Lego design. <br><br>The beautiful red, black and white color scheme is reminiscent of the French TGV's of those times. It has a solid, no-nonsense look which is at the same time reassuring and sophisticated. The red 3x4 wall units with black triangular screen-prints are an example of the rare custom pieces in this set. They are another simple yet effective design element, the finishing touch! <br><br>Another great feature is the working lights at both ends of the train. Note that it is also very easy to illuminate inside the train with additional light bricks that you can hook up to the wiring that is already carrying power from the front unit to the rear. And don't forget certain details inside the middle car, such as an overhead luggage rack and a sink.<br><br>It is unfortunately true that the power pickups on the top tend to fall off easily, as another reviewer also pointed out. But I have to say unless they are touched they do OK. After all, this is not as bad as the nose piece in the set 7898, which not only keeps falling off but doesn't even align properly with the rest of the unit.<br><br>Everything considered, 7745 is a beautiful, sophisticated and timeless design, and a must-have set for any Lego train enthusiast, just like 7740 and 7725.<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"badger740671","2016-03-10T15:54:32.737Z","31 years old yet timeless","<p>One of the most stylish sets in the 12v (or golden) era of Lego trains. It always formed part of my town build up and was fantastic with the lights off to watch the white (much better than yellow) headlights and red brakelights whizzing round the track.</p>

<p>It comes up A LOT on eBay and is good value, I have three copies and 5 extra centre carriages.</p>

<p>One criticism is the minifigs who are a little dull; I appreciate this is pre mega details minifigs but it&#39;s a little dull. That said, the cowboy hat is a nice touch and a chef is always a treat from this 1980s era.</p>

<p>The alternate set was a bit disappointing but with a little imagination this became many versions of the main model.</p>

<p>I got this for my birthday in 1987 I think and was so so so excited.</p>

<p>One thing that has always stuck with me with all the Lego trains is the use of DB stickers. Lego always badged up in the adverts and cataloges with DB which is probably why I chose to but growing up in England I never used the British Rail stickers.</p>
