I just recently dug out my Legos and built the 775-1: Fire Fighter boat.  I still have the original 775 instructions and all of the pieces.  Unfortunately I don't have the original box.  Oh well.

The release date says 77 and that sounds about right.  We moved in 1978 and I know I got this set at the new house.  So I probably got it in 78 or 79.

It floats!  Many of my friends had Lego sets back in that era.  The space sets were particularly popular in my neighborhood. ... but I think I was the only one who had a floating Lego boat!  Most parents would probably never let a kid take their Legos into the tub, so it was cool to have a set that was actually made for that!

Another cool thing about it is that the boat itself is made of 5 elements.  So you could create a small 2 element boat or make it bigger using 1,2, or 3 of the center elements.

I guess I gave it a 5 ranking for nostalgic reasons.  The set is 30 years old and I just built it again today!

I think my grandmother gave this set to me, but I just can't remember for sure.  Which gave me an idea.  You should take a picture of your new sets with the giver and receiver in the picture, then slip that photo into the box or instruction book.  If the kid keeps the set, decades later that photo would bring even more personal value to the set! ... I wish I had a picture of whoever gave me my 775-1: Fire Fighter boat!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
