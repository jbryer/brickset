"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-15T18:24:34Z","A real classic","This steam locomotive is a real classic with its red undercarriage and black body. The tender containing the red engine makes it complete. I particularly like the black hoses, the big red wheels and the tender. Most of the other steam locomitives (7727 or 7730) don't have a tender. It's a must-have for every 12V train fan.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1982<br />
Set type: single locomotive (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7755</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
A big steam engine with lights, this is the second out of three sets that came with a red 12v motor. As everyone knows, it is the only set that uses the big red train wheels (except some service packs, which I don&#39;t consider being a real set). Therefore, the motor is hidden under the tender - what a smart idea. Moreover, the model is equipped with lights, both at the front of the engine and at the end of the tender. The black 2x1 &quot;cable&quot; bricks are also unique to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
It is unclear if this set is affected by the three different versions of the red 12v motor. Most likely, this set was released with at least two different versions of it.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
The grey era offers lots of different steam engines: 3x push-a-long, 1x battery operated, and 3x 12v operated. This one is the biggest and greatest of them. And the most expensive, especially if you need a complete box in good condition.</p>
