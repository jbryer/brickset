"PeteM","2015-06-06T01:11:27.74Z","Is Bigger (And Redder) Better?","<p>Released as part of the second wave of the &lsquo;Grey Era&rsquo; 12v train sets in 1983 (ignoring an anomalous couple that sneaked out in 1981), this was the second diesel engine released following the delightfully compact and excitingly blue <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7760-1/Diesel-Shunter-Locomotive"">7760</a>. It was longer, taller and significantly more red than it&rsquo;s predecessor, but is it an improvement?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are straightforward and, while seeming rushed by modern standards, if you can cope without piece callouts and having to add more than five bricks at a time there is nothing challenging here. The set only uses three colours, all of which are clearly defined.</p>

<p>In keeping with instructions of the time, the second half of the instruction booklet contains an alternative model (so awful in this case that it won&rsquo;t be mentioned again), some track maintenance advice (clean regularly and try not to create short circuits) and the usual charming 12v set diorama (updated with the new sets released in 1983, alongside the classic &lsquo;Intercity&rsquo; <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">7740</a> and the not-classic passenger-less passenger train <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7725-1/Electric-Passenger-Train-Set"">7725</a>).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Unlike the earlier (and smaller) 7760 there are no remarkable or rare parts in the set, just a selection of regular bricks and plates in regular colours (primarily red and black). In addition you get the usual train specific items, including a 28-stud long train base, the classic doors with moulded glass, buffers and magnetic couplers, and a couple of the train weights in red.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one of the classic little yellow-faced train chaps included, dressed in the standard blue uniform and red hat. As with the engineer in 7760 he gets a spanner as an accessory &ndash; something that none of the steam or electric train drivers are armed with. Clearly there is a lot more practical spannering required from a diesel engine driver&hellip;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build consists of fairly basic brick stacking, with no particular techniques or points of interest along the way. The train weights are mounted sideways across the width of the train base and form the front and back of the protruding cab section. The rest of the locomotive is of incredibly simple construction &ndash; there are a couple of sub-builds along the way to break up the monotony (two engine units and the bogies), but otherwise you just build some low walls around the train baseplate, topped off with some 2x8 bricks. When using a 1x2 jumper plate&nbsp;to centre the headlight can be considered a highlight, you know that thrills are in short supply.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final result is solid but unremarkable in appearance. The use of&nbsp;shutters around the engine is effective at breaking up an otherwise plain red mass, and is where this model definitely scores over 7760 &ndash; for when you open the shutters up, little brick-built engine units sit behind each of them! Finally, something for the driver to get his spanner stuck in to.</p>

<p>The red ladders fore and aft which double as engine grills also help add a bit of texture but only extend down the top half of each end. The stickers on the doors also help add a bit of detail, with the set/loco number and the European railway logo of your choice standing out in white.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s no getting around it &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t a classic of the 12v train range. That&rsquo;s not to say that there is anything particularly wrong with it and it&rsquo;s nice enough in it&rsquo;s own way, it&rsquo;s just a little dull. It&rsquo;s based on a solid-looking square engine designed to travel in both directions equally well and, though this translates well into Lego, it is also the set&#39;s&nbsp;biggest weakness. The whole thing has to be symmetrical front and rear, which doesn&rsquo;t leave much room for visual interest or 7760 cuteness (yes, oddly proportioned windows, you are much missed here). In &#39;upgrading&#39; from the 7760 model, the increase in size isn&#39;t justified by an interesting design.</p>

<p>It looks OK on a layout and, in contrast to it&#39;s predecessor, it does fit in equally well hauling both passenger or freight rolling stock supplied with other sets of the time. Unfortunately, unlike the best of the range, the blocky simpleness has not aged well and the red colour scheme just isn&#39;t distinctive.&nbsp;This is based on a workhorse of the railway, but one that usually stays in the background, and for good reason &ndash; collectors would do better to prioritise other sets from the theme before picking this one up.</p>

"Crazy_Chris","2017-12-01T19:13:12.29Z","Solid as a rock","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1983<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: single locomotive (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 2.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7750 and 7760<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
From 1980 to 1982, three single locomotives were available. In 1983, they all were replaced by this model. It&#39;s a modern styled diesel engine, but without any fancy gadgets. Its design is symmetrical and straightforward, but Lego did not forget to donate some details like ladders and lights dummies. Adding the lights kit 7861 is possible, but makes the model look awkward. After a short period of only two years of selling, it vanished without being replaced. It was the last single locomotive until Lego made a new approach in 1991 with set 4551.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are no known variants of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This one is rather sturdy. It looks good, but it lacks the iconic state of its predecessors. Finding a complete model is no big problem, but finding a complete box in good condition is quite a challenge.</p>

"claherre","2017-01-18T15:33:47.547Z","A powerful locomotive?","<p>I agree that this set doesn&#39;t shine like 7760, but it looks massive and powerful, like a mainline locomotive, not like a switcher.</p>

<p>It&#39;s design its typical european, ready to move in either direction without turning the locomotive. The color scheme is simple, mostly red, with some gray and black. Details are simple, but you can see the engine inside the hood. I can imagine it pulling some freight cars in the background. It gets the job done!</p>

<p>At least for me, this set has a special place in my childhood, not because I had it back in the day, but because I dreamed playing with it, after seeing it in a 1984 catalog.</p>
