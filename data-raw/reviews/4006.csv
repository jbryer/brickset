Minimalistic and stylish early 1980s design: dark blue color, &quot;blocky&quot;, bulky, square-edged heavy construction. No compromises, authentic and true-blue look. Just great! Still available from time to time on ebay - but has its value and price as a real classic fantastic brickset.  

The 7760 set can be easily modified to also fit to the 9V engine.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PeteM","2015-05-14T16:28:38.07Z","Blue, Blocky and Brilliant","<p>Released as part of the first wave of the new &lsquo;grey&rsquo; 12v era of Lego train sets in 1980, even on first glance this little shunter set is anything but typical of the range in colour, configuration or contents.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Though the box has long since gone to the great vintage Lego packaging dump in the sky, I do have a vague memory of a small flip top box, covered with the usual array of set pictures, alternate builds etc.&nbsp;I assume it used the main set&nbsp;picture&nbsp;which shows the doors opening backwards, whereas the relevant step within the instructions tells you to put them the other way around. I prefer the former for what it&#39;s worth...</p>

<p>The instructions are a fairly slim volume, to the extent that the 14 steps&nbsp;to construct the&nbsp;main model&nbsp;only take up half of the booklet. The rest is taken up with a &lsquo;secondary&rsquo; build which isn&rsquo;t radically different to the first, setting the cabin slightly further back &ndash; essentially a blue version of the engine in set #<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/4563-1/Load-and-Haul-Railroad"">4563</a>. The piece callouts and leisurely pace of modern instructions are entirely absent and you have to keep an especially&nbsp;close eye on the layering of black plates at the beginning, but that&rsquo;s all part of the fun!</p>

<p>On the back page of the instructions is one of the&nbsp;early 12v dioramas that used to be produced, prominently featuring all of the sets recently released &ndash; I always used to gaze at these, dreaming of owning the entire range. 30 years on and they still have the same effect (and I still don&#39;t have 7750!).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The majority of the pieces in the set are basic black plates and blue bricks which make up the main body of the engine. Additionally there are the usual magnetic couplers and blue train doors &ndash; the latter could only be found in this set for a number of years, until they randomly showed up in a parts pack in 2000, then again in the recent&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60052-1/Cargo-Train"">60052</a> cargo train set. The two 1x3x2 front windows and the two weighted bricks (both in blue) are unique to this set and command a hefty price on the secondary market.</p>

<p>In common with all the train sets released at this time, the large sticker sheet features markings with the logos of all the major railways in Europe which meant that you could reproduce your own national railway, or go for an exotic mix if you were feeling particularly racy.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minifigures included in the set, the first of which is the always essential (if slightly boring) train driver, smartly attired in a red cap, and printed jacket and tie. The second is&nbsp;some kind of railway maintenance man, sporting a hard hat and fetching yellow protective tabard, as well as wielding his formidable, though sadly non-adjusting, spanner. Both feature the classic yellow smiley faces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>While nothing too complicated, the build does proceed at a faster pace than most modern sets, with the whole thing over and done in 14 steps. Rather than utilise the usual 16 stud one-piece train base common to other sets of the era (7720 for example), the chassis is built directly onto and around the 12v motor using layers of black plates, which also provide mounts for the magnetic couplers.</p>

<p>The body of the engine is constructed as a shell, into which the weighted bricks are then placed (front and back) and covered over with blue plates. The cabin forms from the gap between them and the train doors are bracketed at the top by some plates, topped off with a grey sloped roof.</p>

<p>The engine is finished off with some stickers &ndash; hazard markings&nbsp;facing front and back, the engine number / set number on the sides and doors, and then some kind of technical specifications plaque&nbsp;to the rear of the cab.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is undoubtedly a little gem. Well, I say little, but the biggest surprise to me on rebuilding it recently was the size of it &ndash; from my (fallible) memory and the pictures I had seen since, I recollected something much stubbier. However, the extension of the train base by 2 studs really does make a difference, and the blue and black colour scheme really stands out amongst the train sets released at the time which were either entirely, or a combination of, red, yellow, or black. The use of shutters on either side of the main body as engine cowling/vents works really well and helps add some visual interest.</p>

<p>Though many sets of the 12v grey era may seem slightly &lsquo;blocky&rsquo; against more modern models, this style actually really suits the industrial nature of this particular engine and so it has aged well compared to some of its contemporaries.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is undoubtedly a great little set &ndash; I would say under-rated but it&rsquo;s popularity on the secondary market can be seen in the small fortunes that&nbsp;change hands for a set in good condition on eBay and Bricklink. Sadly (and leaving aside Lego&rsquo;s reluctance to release a&nbsp;more diverse&nbsp;train range), due to the space required by modern PF components, we&rsquo;re unlikely to see a similarly sized model anytime soon, so this has the added benefit of uniqueness for set collectors.</p>

<p>I can imagine that this little shunter may have passed under the radar of many potential purchasers at the time &ndash; it couldn&rsquo;t be used as a&nbsp;push-along as it contained a motor and there was no track; and&nbsp;it was a shunter, but with no rolling stock to shunt (rather like the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7725-1/Electric-Passenger-Train-Set"">passenger train</a> with no passengers a year later!). It was a potentially interesting add on to an existing layout, but no use for someone just starting out with the new range of Lego trains.</p>

<p>Despite this, the set can now undoubtedly be considered a classic of the 12v range and it&rsquo;s prestige on the secondhand market is due in part to the fact that it can more than hold it&rsquo;s own on any layout against many of the modern sets (stud haters can always tile the upper surfaces if they so desire).&nbsp;Wonderfully&nbsp;unique, the Diesel Shunter fully deserves both it&#39;s reputation and a place on every 12v layout.</p>

"Crazy_Chris","2017-12-01T19:07:49.507Z","Blue collector's item","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1982<br />
Set type: single locomotive (advanced level / 12v operated)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7755</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
It&#39;s all blue. Originally, this model seemed to be intended as a compact and nice-priced 12v single engine. Due to some unique parts, this has changed totally today. The blue windows and weights were used exclusively in this set, therefore there are expensive. The blue train doors also were unique for quite a long time. But they re-appeared in the year 2014, with release of the power functions train set 60052.<br />
Installing the lights kit 7861 is very easy and doesn&#39;t change the look of the model.<br />
And although the model is really small, it comes with a styrofoam box, just like all the big train and technic sets from that time. This is remarkable, because the boxes of bigger train sets like 7710 or 7822 didn&#39;t use the styrofoam style.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
At least, two different versions of the 12v motor are possible.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This one is iconic. It looks realistic, it has a unique color scheme, and it can be used for different tasks: shunt your wagons, or set up a small train.</p>

"yellowsubmarine","2020-12-13T17:16:58.753Z","Underrated gem","<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The build is straight forward. Nothing complicated. Building my shunter is quite a few years back in time. It took about an hour and a half.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>No exclusive parts beside the 1x3x2 front windows in blue. All other windows in this era were colour red or white. The colour blue is just awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Installing the light kit is simple and does not change the look. One downside by installing the light kit fixing the driver within the stand gets a little complicated.</p>

<p>There are no railroad tracks enclosed which is not important for this kind of locomotive.</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>The men can be fixed on several position on the locomotive even while driving. On the track the locomotive&nbsp;can be used for setting up a freight train, a short train or as the ultimate workhorse in the shunt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Driving along on the railroad track you should be aware the centre of gravity is relative high on this short locomotive. Going to fast into corners the locomotive will easily loose the track and flip over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Still after more than 30 years the 12 V engine itself is still strong and running.&nbsp;This unit got me the best engine ever. Up to this date it is and always will be a true gem in my collection. I would recommend this Diesel Shunter Locomotive to every AFOL or train enthusiast.&nbsp;</p>
