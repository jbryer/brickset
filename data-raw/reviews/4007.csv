"jpmanalo","2005-09-25T10:09:16Z","Fuel for dreams....","I received this book when I was 7 years old, about a month after my parents gave me 7710 Push Train set. I still have the book in my possession (albeit in tattered, dog-eared condition).

The models shown throughout this book are fantastic, and most can be built with very basic pieces.

Idea highlights from the book are:
* A Circus Train designed for the 4.5V Battery train
* A small 2-axle boxcar wagon - excellent use of non-specialised bricks in my opinion.
* The three diesel/electric locomotives in the middle of the book

I had a whole set with the old blue tracks in the 70s but they were no longer compatible once LEGO came out with the grey 9V system. I remember being very disappointed that I could not longer expand my existing train set. Nevertheless I marveled at the new 9V system and the possibilities pictured in this fantastic book.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
