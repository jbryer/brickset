Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This model is a very basic designed steam engine, but different to set 7710. And just like in sets 7710 and 7720, there is a brick-built motor dummy, that allows the model to be upgraded either with a 4,5v or a 12v motor.<br />
Also like in sets 7710 and 7720, the connection of the motor dummy to the baseplate is rather weak, and can be improved by adding some plates. All in all, it doesn&#39;t look as if this set was a huge success, as it was dropped from the line-up after 1982 without a successor. But it shows, that Lego wanted to provide supplemental sets for everyone, even for those who couldn&#39;t afford 12v sets.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants or alternate parts are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Nothing spectacular, it is even easy to rebrick this model. The challenge for collectors is to get a set with a good box. The alternate model is worth a look, I guess it is a kind of mine locomotive.</p>
