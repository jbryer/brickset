It looks particularly good with the 7823: Container Crane Depot and 7839: Car Transport Depot wagons. It&#39;s really solid when constructed and although there are no particularly special parts it really does complete your set up well.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
After a gap of three years, a new shell tanker van was released in 1986. Compared to 7816, it looks very much modernized. There are interesting details, and there is a kind of petrol winch which increases playability.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This one is way better than 7816. And, it is the perfect add-on for 7722 and 7735.</p>
