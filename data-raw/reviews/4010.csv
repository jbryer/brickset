<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
Alongside with 7740 and 7820, this was one of three sets that came with the big 6x28 train baseplate in 1980. The crane uses two of the 1980 new parts &quot;lattice / train signal stand&quot;, and is operated by two winches. All in all, he design is reduced but functional. Unfortunately, it lacks support stands, so it may tip over if the load is too heavy.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Every &quot;work&quot; train needs such a crane car. It adds playability, and the train base allowed the kids to build bigger locomotives even if they didn&#39;t own a 7740.</p>
