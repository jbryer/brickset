"Crazy_Chris","2017-12-08T18:09:51.23Z","Frist add-on for 7740","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1983<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: single wagon (big size)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 2.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This is one of two add-on sets for the 7740 express: a sleeper car. Interestingly, it wasn&#39;t announced as such in the 1983 catalog. It was presented just like any other new set. Inside, there are four beds, two of them mounted with hinges. And there is a sink, where the minifigs can wash themselves after waking up.<br />
At the outside, printed tiles show what type of car this is, and what set number it has. This was very unusual, because most of all the other train sets use stickers.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants are known for this set. Due to the short production period, correct hinges must be always those with solid studs.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
A good set to enhance your 7740 train. But it had a short selling period. As 7740 was replaced by 7745 in 1985, this one also disappeared. Lego did nothing similar for the high-speed train 7745, but the 9v Metroliner got an additional sleeper car in 1993.</p>

"PeteM","2017-07-14T16:45:44.923Z","A Sweet Dream","<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Nestled within the second wave of the 12v Train range, this was the first proper Sleeper Carriage to be released (yes, I know <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/137-2/Passenger-sleeping-car"">137-2</a> calls itself a sleeping car but, apart from a bed sticker on the outside, there is nothing else remotely &lsquo;sleeper&rsquo; about it! Different times&hellip;). So how does 7815 hold up?</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Box / Instructions</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">In common with all of the Train sets at the time, the box art shows the model parked in a muddy field near some pylons and with the rest of the box in the matt silver branding of the 12v sets. Not particularly exciting, but tremendously nostalgic for me! The instructions are admirably brief, completing the main model in just 11 steps (with a couple of sub builds along the way), which reflects the fairly simple nature of the build, as well a large number of pieces placed per step, as was common then. The back, as always, features one of the excellent dioramas for the range, updated with sets released in 1983 such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7755-1/Diesel-Heavy-Shunting-Locomotive"">7755</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7824-1/Railway-Station"">7824</a> alongside the original, legendary, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">7740</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The instructions for the secondary model build a tiny dining car, a little over half the length of the main model. This is fairly disposable, but does feature brick built seats, as well as giving a good grounding in building train bases without using the large single pieces most other carriages used at the time (and still do!), so bonus marks for inspiration on that front.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Parts</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">There are the usual assortment of train pieces &ndash; wheels, magnetic couplings etc, as well as two types of train window (with glass) and the yellow and red doors found in numerous other 12v sets. This was one of the first of the range to have the &lsquo;double roof&rsquo; element which was a shortcut for the multitude of 33 degree 3x4 slopes provided previously. Though this gives increased stability for the roof structure, it was to the detriment of being able to be easily used elsewhere &ndash; incorporating them into a spaceship build (the eventual fate of much of my Lego) was a challenge!</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The printed pieces included were simple but first-rate &ndash; four 1x2 white tiles featuring the set/carriage number of 7815, and four more featuring a little bed icon, indicating the coach&rsquo;s function. Unique to the set, these will set you back around &pound;50 by themselves at time of writing, which makes up most of the total cost of a full second-hand set!</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Minifigures</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The minifigs supplied serve their purpose &ndash; one male, one female. If they have any frustration at having to sleep in separate, hard bunks, they don&rsquo;t show it, adorned as they are with the classic Lego smiley face.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The Build</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Construction of the set is as straight forward as could be expected &ndash; some careful stud-counting is required at the beginning to get some of the internal details in the correct position, but it&rsquo;s mostly brick-and-tile on brick-and-tile all the way up. The exception is the clever (for the time) assembly of the top bunks, which are affixed to the back of a headlight brick via 1x2 jumper plate and then mounted on finger-hinge plates so that they can pivot up and down. The &lsquo;outside&rsquo; of the headlight bricks are then used to mount the printed tiles at either end of the carriage.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Completed Model and Overall Opinion</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The completed sleeping car model is utterly charming and, along with the contemporary <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7819-1/Postal-Container-Wagon"">7819</a> mail van, consolidates the red and yellow colour scheme started with 7740 three years earlier as <em>the</em> 12v Train livery. This world-building (albeit minor) allowed children to supplement their sets with different, but complementary, rolling stock and thereby expand the play possibilities of the range, as well as tie it into sets from the wider &lsquo;Town&rsquo; theme. If only such an approach was supported by the current releases&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The use of narrow windows in the middle section is a great little detail, breaking up the monotony that a row of identical windows brings, as well as being prototypically accurate as this provides some extra privacy in the sleeping area for the occupants. The interior provides enough details for play without cluttering the limited space. The carriage can sleep four in total in two bunk bed arrangements, though that does make it a bit crowded &ndash; however, the fold-up bunks are good fun and the little wash area between the two halves of the carriage is a nice feature. The roof isn&rsquo;t that easy to remove to allow access inside, another draw back of the &lsquo;double-wide&rsquo; roof pieces which don&rsquo;t provide any way of bracing the sections together for easy removal. The beds are basic by today&rsquo;s standards &ndash; the 4547 Club Car ten years later would improve noticeably in this area.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">These minor issues aside, this still stands as one of the best 12v rolling stock sets released. The first sleeping carriage of the &lsquo;minifig era&rsquo;, it set the bar high for simplicity of design, and fits seamlessly into a layout alongside the rest of the range, as well as being distinctive enough to stand out as part of a larger rake of coaches. It makes the 7740 a true &#39;Intercity&#39; set as well as providing play value in it&#39;s own right and in my opinion, is a must have for any fan of the era.</span></p>
