"T79","2015-03-20T10:25:25.593Z","Trains + Things that go 'boom' = FUN","<p>I remember I got this wagon a lot later than my #7735 Cargo Train, so supposedly this set was left on a shelf for several years. I guess sets back then didn&#39;t rotate nearly as fast into new ones as they do now? O, but for simpler times...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have either anymore. Which is&nbsp;strange as I still have most manuals and/or boxes from my train sets and accessories, even such uninteresting ones as those from #7861 Lighting Set 12V and #7864 Transformer 12V, what was I thinking back then? So internet to the rescue, where I found scans of the small sheet that were the instructions of this set: 13 steps for 120 pieces, they certainly raced through this one. And so there was room left for an image of the set and a promo image showing off most of the train sets available at the time, unattainable for most of us even back then yet mouthwatering to say the least.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are hardly special pieces here if you leave out the train wheels and buffers. Almost all are standard plates, bricks and slopes, though some of them came in quantities that made it impossible to make another copy from our other&nbsp;sets, like the&nbsp;twelve yellow Slope Brick 45 2 x 2 inverted, or just difficult with the six white Slope Brick 45 2 x 4 and four red Plate 1 x 2 with Ladder. An exception to these standard parts would be the two pneumatic&nbsp;hoses which provide a bit of detail below the tank. Just why this wagon has red wheels is something I never understood, I always thought it had something to do with the year it was produced in but looking at it now it seems black and red train wheels have coexisted all through the eighties. Did Lego want some variation there or what is that about?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifigure with a hard hat and a torso with Shell logo, it&#39;s weird how this one comes with a minifigure while #6628 Shell Tow Truck comes without one, even though arguably that set would benefit more from a minifigure.&nbsp;For this wagon to work you already need a (freight) train which has minifigures anyway, in case of #7735 there&#39;s even one with&nbsp;a torso with Shell logo too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very basic, the wagon starts like the wagons in #7735 and the tank itself is just layering inverted slope bricks, plates, bricks and slope bricks. Even as a kid I thought the way it was constructed was rather inefficient and could have been done cleaner. The worst part was of course those stickers over several parts, just like with e.g. #6668 Recycle Truck these have not survived as I could not resist placing them but later on inevitably the set ended up dismantled to build something else. It&#39;s better (or even worse, since these lego parts were&nbsp;already available!) once you realise that two white 1 x 6 bricks with Shell print and two white 1 x 2 bricks with the Shell logo print can replace the stickers quite satisfactory.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Which&nbsp;is just the way I built this now, and with those bricks it looks as good as with the stickers. Luckily I had them lying around&nbsp;as without these its&nbsp;appearance is even more spartan, I know it is just an industrial model but still, a little colour on that white expanse of the tanker looks better. It works well with my cargo train&nbsp; #7735, in fact it looks&nbsp;a lot better than the original Shell wagon included there although the red wheels make it stand out. It&#39;s a rather square (supposed to be a cylinder)&nbsp;tank but that&#39;s just the blocky lego charm, IMHO better&nbsp;than just using big, round panels as I&#39;ve seen in some more recent sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>On its own you know there&#39;s not a lot you can do with it, but combine it with some other things and then you&#39;re talking: a train with this wagon + a road crossing = boom! I think countless hours have been passed that way and I doubt that&#39;ll have changed with the next generation (add a tanker truck on the road crossing and imagine yourself boom&sup2;)!</p>

Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1982<br />
Set type: single wagon (compact size)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7813</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This a small tanker car in Shell colors design. The build is sturdy and blocky. It looks recognizable, but nothing more.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
One of the least attractive train sets. Playability is close to zero, the set is just a bunch of mainly basic bricks. Maybe this was the reason why it had been dropped from the line-up very early.</p>
