Year of release: 1985<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: single wagon (big size)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7814<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
1985 saw the release of this new crane wagon. It looks more modern than 7814, e.g. the crane cabin has a roof now. But from technical view, it is less sophisticated. There is only one winch, and the angle of the crane arm is locked by a hinge plate construction. Fortunately, the model has support stands, this is a big improvement compared to 7814.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
Early versions of the set use hinge plates with solid studs, while later versions use hinge plates with hollow studs.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
There are pros and cons. It looks good and works fine, but it lacks the rough charm of 7814.</p>
