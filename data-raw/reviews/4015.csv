"PeteM","2016-07-29T16:57:31.583Z","Great Upgrade","<p>The train sets of the 1980s, unlike today, were supported by a growing range of rolling stock which could be bolted on to your existing sets and open up the expanding playability of the system as a whole. As such, the choice of a second mail van, only three short years after <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7820-1/Mail-Van"">#7820</a> was released, initially seems odd when there were so many other possibilities that hadn&rsquo;t yet been explored. However, it makes more sense when you consider that a Postal subtheme (complete with Horn and Envelope branding seen here) had been introduced the year before, and this set therefore provided a neat intersection between the Town and Train themes.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are a simple folded sheet which concertinas out to show the 14 steps (+ sub-builds for the bogies) required to complete the model. As all the colours are distinct from one another, there is no confusion between any of them and the steps are straightforward. As was common at the time, the instructions also include directions for a secondary model &ndash; in this case a half-size mail van with a platform for unloading the mail parcel. These secondary builds are often a mixed bag, but I remember building this one and being quite impressed with it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>By today&rsquo;s standards none of the parts are particularly interesting, though there is the usual complement of train-specific pieces which are of use in almost any rolling stock you could wish to build. There is a smattering of red and yellow 1xn bricks in a variety of lengths for the body of the carriage, but fewer than you might expect as half of the length on each side&nbsp;is taken up by red sliding doors, and standard doors and windows account for another good portion of the wagon.</p>

<p>New that year were the double-width roof elements which replaced individual slope pieces used previously &ndash; a baby step towards single big pieces taking the place of more versatile smaller ones that would plague Town / City sets in the later 1990s. There are also a few of the new(ish) printed &lsquo;envelope&rsquo; 1x2 tiles which had been introduced in the Town subtheme the year before and are still in use today.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only minifig included is the railway-based postal sorter. His plain black legs and yellow smiley face are&nbsp;fairly standard, but excitingly (for 1983) he has a red torso printed with a shirt design and the insignia of the Lego post service. This design appeared in all of the 1980s Postal subtheme sets, as well as regularly cropping up in Town-themed &lsquo;army builders&rsquo; until the early 1990s. Despite being fairly niche, it was iconic enough to later feature in a couple of &lsquo;Vintage Minfigure Collector&rsquo; sets in 2009 and 2012</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Brick stacking is the order of the day here and there are no novel or challenging techniques, which means the whole thing goes together fairly quickly. The only remotely tricky bit is getting the pairs of doors hooked on the bottom rail, aligned properly and then braced by the top rail before everything either falls out or, if too much force is brought to bear, explodes everywhere in a shower of red and yellow.</p>

<h3>The completed model and Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The end result fulfills the brief &ndash; a distinctive good-sized mail van &ndash; but offers a noticeable step up from the previous model in nearly every way. The red and yellow colour scheme really pops and is designed to complement the existing <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">#7740</a> Intercity, as well as the supplementary <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7815-1/Passenger-Carriage-Sleeper"">#7815</a> Sleeper Carriage released the same year as this.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very solid considering half of the walls are missing, mainly thanks to a couple of plates which provide bracing across the wagon where the doors meet. The sliding doors are more prototypical than those on 7820 and, though the roof doesn&rsquo;t lift off in one piece, the larger pieces have weaker clutch at the edges so don&rsquo;t destroy sections of the wall when removed, allowing easy access inside (for little fingers anyway, the four-wide space is a more challenging play space with adult hands!).</p>

<p>Disappointingly the Lego Post logos are all stickers and, worse, those at the ends of the wagon are placed over multiple bricks &ndash; a cardinal sin now, but something which was common in the 1980s and is why many (including mine) didn&rsquo;t survive if the set was broken down for use elsewhere. However, the printed envelope tiles are very welcome and are more effective than the random blue parcels of the previous mail van.</p>

<p>Finally, though it fits right in with, and supports, other sets in the Town Postal subtheme, it&rsquo;s also perfectly able to stand alone solely as part of a train set. It doesn&rsquo;t even need the matching 7740 as the 12v theme offered a couple of standalone diesel engines in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7760-1/Diesel-Shunter-Locomotive"">7760</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7755-1/Diesel-Heavy-Shunting-Locomotive"">7755</a>, as well as full good trains like <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7727-1/Freight-Steam-Train-Set"">7727</a> in the wider range. Though the vibrant colour scheme might stand out a little alongside the newer sets from the PF era, I would <span class=""st"">unequivocally</span> recommended this as an addition to any layout.</p>

"Crazy_Chris","2017-12-08T18:10:49.617Z","Second add-on for 7740","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1983<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: single wagon (big size)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 2.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7820<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This is one of two add-on sets for the 7740 express: a mail van. Interestingly, it wasn&#39;t announced as such in the 1983 catalog. It was presented just like any other new set. It replaced 7820 and it uses the big sliding doors, which were new parts in 1983. The alternate model is a shortened version, which is similar to the mail van from set 7722 (which was released afterwards in 1985).</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
A good set to enhance your 7740 train. Because of the sliding door plates, the body is two plates higher than 7815 and the 7740 wagons. But usually, no one cares about that.</p>
