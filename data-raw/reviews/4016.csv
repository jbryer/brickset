"Lego12vFan","2009-04-26T12:28:42.64Z","Solid, no-nonsense look, still fresh and attractive today","Although very similar to 7819, this wagon has somewhat older looking features--like the hinged doors, which are quite alluring. The way the two cargo pieces are built from basic Lego bricks also adds to this no-nonsense, simple and clean feel. The hinged cargo doors have a nice vertical ribbed texture, which makes the whole car very attractive. I also like the asymmetry of one large window on one side and two smaller ones on the other side of the wagon. As opposed to 7819, which is meant to go specifically with the intercity train set 7740, this all-red wagon suits not only to 7740 but to any other train set. Due to its overall red coloring it has a very solid look, and its very pretty to look at.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PeteM","2016-05-27T17:25:21.87Z","This is the Night Mail, crossing the border","<p>Coming at the start of the &lsquo;grey&rsquo; 12v era for Lego Trains, this was one of the first sets released in the new line up and was a stand alone &lsquo;extra&rsquo; which could be added to an existing setup to add extra play value and expand the rolling stock on a layout.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are a simple folded sheet and feature two separate models &ndash; the first 13 steps build the mail van as advertised, and then there are 7 steps for a large open-topped wagon with a cab at one end, like a scaled up version of the brake van from <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7720-1/Diesel-Freight-Train-Set"">#7720</a>. This secondary model is serviceable, if not as impressive as the main model, but these alternate builds were always good to spark the imagination and remind the builder that there is more to Lego bricks than the set that they came in. The back page of the instructions features a new and completely charming 12v diorama, showing this set coupled to the rear end of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">#7740</a>.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>None of the parts are particularly noteworthy, though there is the usual complement of train-specific pieces (many of which were introduced in that year) including bogie plates, the new train door and two types of window frames, all of which feature special glass moulded with &lsquo;half open&rsquo; effect. Buffer beams and wheels complete the set, which is otherwise dominated by red 1xn bricks in a variety of lengths. I remember the four red doors were fairly exciting for me at the time for some reason, and there are also a good number of grey 33 degree sloped bricks which have utility in nearly any building you may wish to make.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two minifigs included are fairly standard. One is a railway worker in a new blue torso print with shirt buttons and pockets, and he also gets a hard hat to protect him against unexpected mail-room health and safety disasters. The other chap is plain, even by standards of the day, consisting of a white torso and black legs, with a blue flat cap on top the classic Lego smiley face.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Most of the construction is basic brick stacking, with the floorplan of the van laid out with 1xn red bricks which are then built up. Gaps are left on the sides for doors and windows, as well as at the end for the &lsquo;gangway connection&rsquo; which provides a &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; link to coupled carriages when combined with other sets. There is a little jiggery-pokery with plates in the middle section so that cross beams can be added across the top of the double door opening, utilising the three-plates-make-a-brick ratio to make sure that everything is level when tiles are added around the top. The bogies construction and under-carriage &lsquo;greebling&rsquo; is fairly basic but, using a mix of inverted slopes and square bricks, is a great exercise in providing the impression of detail while using a bare minimum of actual pieces.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The end result is pleasingly basic and very very red. One end consists of a small segregated seating area with two seats &ndash; this dovetails nicely when the wagon is used with a passenger train (though the matching&nbsp;all-red <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7725-1/Electric-Passenger-Train-Set"">#7725</a> was still a year away at this point, and didn&rsquo;t have any passengers anyway!). The large parcel storage and sorting area takes up the remaining two-thirds of the length, with a table the only additional construction in the space. There is just enough room to move minifigs around in here, though the two sections of &lsquo;removable&rsquo; roof are still held on by four studs at each side of the ends, and these provide sufficient clutch that I still often rip apart a good portion of the wagon whenever I try to get the roof off.</p>

<p>The printed mail tiles that we&rsquo;re all now very familiar with were a couple of years in the future at this point, so the cargo is represented by plain blue bricks on a yellow pallet, which do the job and provide a bit of interest &ndash; they were also the same design as the pallets in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7730-1/Electric-Goods-Train-Set"">#7730</a> so were compatible with the forklift from that set if you were lucky enough to have it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nostalgically I love this set, and it is a lovely representation of the era and a solid addition to a layout &ndash; not as exciting as the crane released the same year, but not as dull as the Shell tanker either. As an &#39;add on&#39; stand alone, it gave scope for further imaginative play when combined with other sets in the range, as the title of this review suggests. However, my opinion of it is tempered by the fact that I know better is to come and, as such, it&rsquo;s difficult to argue that this is any more than a charmingly average model when looked at as part of the larger 12v range. However, I appreciate it as part of my collection and it is deserving of its place in the vanguard of the new train system releases.</p>

"Crazy_Chris","2017-12-06T20:03:13.847Z","The first big mail van","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1982<br />
Set type: single wagon (big size)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 7819</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This wagon is the third set from 1980 that comes with the big 6x28 train baseplate. The sliding doors were not invented yet, so Lego had to find another solution. Instead, they used the &quot;shed style&quot; doors for loading the freight, and this doesn&#39;t look too bad.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are no known variants of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This wagon is nothing special, but it can be used in different ways. Add it to a 7740 (in the pre-7819 era). Or buy two of them, take a 7750 and create a new train (this option is shown in some contemporary ads).</p>
