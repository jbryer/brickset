<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are a&nbsp;simple fold out sheet, containing just 12 steps to construct the wagon, and a further 5 for the lamp post. As much as to take up space as anything else, it also includes an alternative build, a flatter wagon capable of transporting a dismantled lamp post (though apart from the lack of a superstructure it&rsquo;s not substantially different from the main build).</p>

<p>Rather than the terrifying screaming face of the infamous &lsquo;WIN!!&rsquo; child that freaks out the current generation of Lego builders, the back of the instruction sheet instead shows a lovely snapshot of part of a layout, the kind I always coveted as a child. It shows off many of the brand new sets of 1983, alongside the older <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">7740</a> Intercity and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7725-1/Electric-Passenger-Train-Set"">7725</a> Passenger Trains.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Containing just 82 pieces, the set makes extensive use of basic plate parts, as well as the default train wheels and magnetic couplers. The angled stanchions that are used to support the raised platform were an&nbsp;exciting new piece at the time, and became a staple of &lsquo;base&rsquo; sets in the space theme thereafter.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two classic &lsquo;smiley&rsquo; minifigures included are in the standard railway workers blue uniform with white printing on the front of the torso, and are sensibly wearing red hard hats in case any of their lighting maintenance work gets out of hand.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a fairly straight forward affair, starting with construction on the underside of the wagon which will be familiar to anyone who has built other train sets from the era. Various plates and inverted slopes are combined to attach the couplers and set the wheels in place &ndash; the base is short enough that it only requires a single wheel set at either end.</p>

<p>The only bricks involved in the whole set (three 2x1s) are then used to build the small ladder setup on the top, with the stanchions added around it and plates connecting it all to create a skeletal raised platform . With the turntable firmly cradled by this platform, a yellow plate (with some low &lsquo;safety&rsquo; fencing around it) creates the swivelling platform which tops off the set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A small functional model, the mostly black colour scheme makes the set look suitably industrial (as opposed to the brighter liveries used on passenger sets), with the yellow of the swivel platform as well as the railings at either end adding a welcome splash of colour.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a lamp post gives the set its raison d&#39;&ecirc;tre, and the wagon does look a lot better &lsquo;parked&rsquo; up in a siding alongside the post rather than being pulled around the track with other freight, where its ungainly appearance stands out a bit. Having said that, it still fits in beautifully when being shunted around in a yard setup by <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7735-1/Freight-Train-Set"">7735</a> or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7760-1/Diesel-Shunter-Locomotive"">7760</a>.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This maintenance wagon is a perfect example of the kind of thing I wish Lego would bring back into the modern train line. Being able to purchase a stand alone set to supplement their existing rolling stock means that children can slowly build up a large and varied collection of wagons to fulfil any play scenario under the sun &ndash; especially if it&rsquo;s a small, relatively inexpensive set like this. The &lsquo;story&rsquo; (if you want to call it that) of the set only grows when combined with the wider theme, further bolstering the playability of larger sets. It&rsquo;s a shame that reportedly low sales of train-related products only supports the retail model of selling &lsquo;complete&rsquo; sets, as this logic quickly becomes a self fulfilling prophesy&hellip;</p>

<p>Thankfully there was a time when Lego would produce fantastic little sets like this, which fits right into any 12v layout or could even sit alongside the more modern freight wagons from the power functions line. An under appreciated and unexpected gem.</p>

Year of release: 1983<br />
Last year in catalog: 1985<br />
Set type: single wagon (compact size)<br />
Generation (within grey era): 2.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
In 1983, lots of new parts were released. This maintenance wagon uses the big new &quot;space&quot; stands. The platform can be rotated, but must be locked when the train is running. There is also a light post, using the same design as set 7867.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
It looks as if Lego tried to use as much of the new parts in as many different sets as possible. Mission accomplished, this one works very well. But the parts don&#39;t end in themselves, the all contribute to a harmonic design and nice working features.</p>
