The wagons are easy to buy individual pieces and build multiple copies, hence I have 5 and 10 containers for this set! 

The colours are great and it is multi-directional move wise. There is nothing I would have changed.

Year of release: 1986<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: building<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.5<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7838<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This is a huge container crane, alongside with a special wagon and a container truck. The model looks and works like a real crane, to improve stability some technic bricks are used. After 7838, it is the second of three sets that came with a special wagon. And there is a new-styled baseplate with additional cycle track, as it has been introduced in 1986 for classic town sets.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
Early versions of the set use hinge plates with solid studs, and 1x1 plates with thin rings. Later versions use hinge plates with hollow studs, and 1x1 plates with thick rings.<br />
Moreover, there are different versions of the conducting rails: Either with or without holes, but always with additional reinforcements at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
With more than 400 pieces, this is one of the bigger sets. It works great, it looks great, it is great. And as a big surprise, it is equipped with conducting rails.<br />
For a better integration into a pre-1986 town layout, I prefer to use an old road baseplate without cycle track.</p>
