I'm from ther generation of battery powered trains, possibly the best train legos ever made.  The design to this station is decidedly unique and makes a great focal point in any town, especially since towns formed around train stations during the early years of most nations.  I give this set a ten due to its wonderful design and for many satisfied hours of play.  And Remember... Crime does not pay!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"fruitbat","2010-01-26T18:14:40.483Z","wonderful little station","The only criticism I have of this station is that constructing the base was difficult even for my Dad and that some parts are a little fragile. However the wonderful design with the postoffice, the coffee machine in the cafe, the lights, the suitcases, the timetable sticker and its wonderful ""look"" make it a fantastic station! In fact I wish most stations looked as good and the passengers as happy as this one! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Year of release: 1983<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: building<br />
Generation (within grey era): 2.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7822<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
Train sets from 1983 are remarkable: some had a very short selling period until the end of 1984 (e.g. 7727, 7815 and 7819). Others had an extremely long selling period until the end of 1990. This railway station belongs to the second category. Like its predecessor, it is also huge, but the style is different. It is built on standard baseplates, and there is no stairs crossover. There are quite some new parts, compared to 1980. The buggy is the same as in set 7727, just built in another color. And there are nine minifigs, what is a big improvement compared to 7822.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
Early versions of the set use hinge plates with solid studs, and 1x1 plates with thin rings.<br />
Later versions use hinge plates with hollow studs, and 1x1 plates with thick rings.<br />
Moreover, there are two different box size versions: rectangular wide (copyright 1983) and rectangular standard (copyright 1989).</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Again, this train station came without conducting rails. Why? Nobody knows. Compared to 7822, it looks less impressive. But two (or more) lanes of track are possible without modifications.</p>

"claherre","2017-01-14T02:42:33.46Z","Lots of details in a small place","<p>This set has a certain charm. I think 7822 is more realistic, but this one has a lot of details. It&#39;s like a big train station compressed for a small town. It has some clever use of parts for the two side ramps and the inclined roof, the nice touch of the &quot;entrance&quot; in the back, and my favourite, the small office in the second floor.</p>

<p>The best aspect is the amount and variety of minifigs.</p>

<p>It has its share of cons:</p>

<p>- No electrified rails</p>

<p>- The inclined roof is a bit weak if you try to move the whole set</p>

<p>- You have just one side of the station, but at the same time, it&#39;s easy to add another platform, or two tracks</p>

"PeteM","2014-10-29T23:11:04.723Z","THE station of the 12v era","<p>Railway stations are a mainstay of the Train line &ndash;&nbsp;the wonderful plethora of track-side structures available in the 1970s and 80s, whether container yards, fuel refineries or car transport depot, have all&nbsp;fallen out of favour, yet stations continue to feature in the now sadly limited number of train related sets. Coming fairly hot on the heels of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7822-1/Railway-Station"">7822</a> from just a few years earlier, this set redefined the station in the 12v era and provided a template for several of the sets that followed.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are a slim affair - just 20 steps in an A4 booklet complete the entire station, with a disproportionate 14 further steps for the small luggage van. The front cover also shows a rather uninspiring &#39;alternative&#39; build, which appears to just be a smaller, less interesting station...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t anything too exciting in the parts selection, though the various sizes of light grey plates that make up the platform were a welcome addition to my collection. This set did mark the first appearance of the printed station clock (as opposed to the stickers used previously), a piece which still appears in station sets thirty years on. It also contains four pieces of standard non-electrified track to run in front of the platform, another tradition that continues to this day!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get a pretty marvellous nine minifigures with the set &ndash; four railway/station workers, an over-dressed chef (seriously, what is he cooking in that tiny kitchen?!) and four passengers. The railway staff have two different torso prints between the four of them, with the ticket office lady and train dispatch chap in slightly smarter attire than the luggage wagon driver and signalman. Being used to the standard hair pieces and flat caps of the most other town sets I remember being excited at one of the passengers having a cowboy hat - in my head having a minifig who resembled an escapee from Dallas (the TV series, not the city) made the set seem much more exotic&hellip;!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts off fairly repetitively on the supports for the raised platform, which means placing little stacks of 1x2 bricks at various points across the two large baseplates (no cheating with large molded pieces here!). Thankfully the odd variation in order to add in the steps at the rear, as well as the slopes at either end of the platform, helps to break this up a bit. It&rsquo;s all fairly fragile at this stage and not much better even once all the sections of the platform are down, though once the building structures start to go up, it holds together a bit better.</p>

<p>Everything is constructed in horizontal strips, so the whole thing, from ticket office across to signal box, rises up at the same speed. The latter is the more interesting structure as it is raised above the level of the rest of the building, with 2x2 inverted slopes and 1x4 plates creating a stairway up from platform level. Using a right-angle bracket and some more plates to mount the clock on the outside of the signal box was quite interesting (to me at the time, anyway!).</p>

<p>There is a brief&nbsp;Lego geometry lesson in the&nbsp;implementation of an&nbsp;angled canopy which provides a bit of extra shelter over the waiting area. The old-fashioned finger hinges provide support both underneath and another set attach on top, holding the canopy rock solid but at an outward angle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the station is done, the set is finished&nbsp;off&nbsp;with a small yellow luggage wagon. This is a charming quick little build, with the chassis constructed entirely from plates and a couple of bricks, and completed&nbsp;with a tow ball attachment to a small trolley for carrying around the weighty Lego suitcases.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The end result is impressive, playable and looks fantastic, containing a surprising amount of detail and play options, with a caf&eacute; outlet, a ticket office and&nbsp;waiting room (complete with train timetable), and a telephone and post box all included in the structure. The raised signal box gives it some extra height as well as providing a distinctive entranceway and some train-related play that doesn&rsquo;t revolve around passengers waiting or buying ice cream. The distinctive red and black colour theme looks great, complementing other town sets of the era, as well as the 12v rolling stock.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set marked a notable departure from the past &ndash; dispensing with the dual platform setup common to the previous two sets means that the station can sit by itself on a &lsquo;passing loop&rsquo;, allowing a train to stop at the station while others can continue to run around the track layout (especially if combined with the signal set which automatically cut the power to the relevant portion of the track). This design carried through to&nbsp;all subsequent sets until the 2010 station reinstated a&nbsp;bridge over the tracks.</p>

<p>The luggage wagon is a brilliant little addition and the platform area is wide for plenty of action to take place. The only minor gripe is that, though it&rsquo;s just about long enough for the two carriages of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7740-1/Inter-City-Passenger-Train-Set"">7740</a> Intercity, passengers in any additional carriages&nbsp;are in for a challenging &lsquo;de-training experience&rsquo;, but that&rsquo;s common to all the station sets Lego have ever released.</p>

<p>With a vibrant modern feel, high playability and a wonderfully distinctive silhouette, this is the defining station set of the 12v era for me.</p>
