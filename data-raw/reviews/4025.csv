I imagine this set as an small crossing, far away from the big city. In fact, in my country (Chile) these train crossings&nbsp;are common: two barriers, sometimes manually operated, and a train worker guarding the small house or office.</p>

<p>In conclusion, maybe not an important set, but it captures the simplicity and realism of 80s sets.</p>

Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1984<br />
Set type: building<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
A small, a hand-driven railway crossing. Gates and other functional pieces were taken from the blue era. There is a very small house and a cypress tree.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are variants of the set regarding the conducting rails: either with or without holes, but always without additional supports.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
It looks bigger than it is, because actually this is a very small set with less than 100 pices. But it came with conducting rails, in contrast to the railway station 7822. For combining trains and classic town, this set is very useful.</p>
