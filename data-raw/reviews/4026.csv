It's a critical piece of infrastructure for any lego town with a train - unlike the monorail sweeping overhead, train tracks stay earthbound, and cars must get across somehow. The included unusual tree and unique crossing gate pieces make this a highly desirable set, and it is a critical enhancement for any rail/road scenario.",FALSE,4,5,3,4,4
"Crazy_Chris","2017-12-20T19:50:24.073Z","Modernized upgrade to 7834","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Year of release: 1985<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: building<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): 7834<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
Modern times were calling, compared to 7734 this one looks futuristic. The simple house has transformed into a modern cab. The crossing gates were modernized, and the crossing itself is built of four big new slopes, instead of using the former monolithic part. Just the cypress tree remained unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are no known variants of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
The model looks simple, but there are quite some interesting details. It is a nice little upgrade of 7734. But strange enough, the conducting rails were dropped from the contents.</p>

"T79","2014-10-17T12:42:05.55Z","Can't have a train without a road crossing!","<p>A rather less advanced version of its predecessor #7866 Remote Controlled Crossing,&nbsp;both in terms of&nbsp;the number of pieces and&nbsp;design&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the lack of electrification. I guess that showed in the price though, and a simple road crossing sure beats <em>no</em> road crossing (even now <em>my</em> children complain about the fact that their wooden train&nbsp;- think Brio, I know: <em>not </em>Lego&nbsp;-&nbsp;does not (yet) have&nbsp; a road crossing).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No longer in my possession. Fortunately the instructions are available online, and the build itself is really simple so it&#39;s not like you are missing out for not having them anymore. 15 steps isn&#39;t too much for about 130 pieces but since a lot of those pieces are really big it&#39;s never difficult to see what needs to happen. A nice touch is the picture on the back with an alternative -&nbsp;unguarded, there are even road signs included for that&nbsp;-&nbsp;road crossing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set looks big but that is just because of the road baseplate and the railroad tracks with ramp, the number of pieces included is really underwhelming. Still, what you get is pretty good: a straight road baseplate, four roadsigns (two for a guarded and two for an unguarded crossing), two barriers and counterweights, four slope brick 10 6 x 8 to form the ramps for crossing the rails (included are two sections of straight track, no electric rails though but still I have the extra electric rails needed?), two of those 3 x 4 x 4 inverted windscreens and the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance: a cypress (peeron tells me it&#39;s a cedar but I always thought&nbsp;it was a cypress and bricklink agrees with me, so there) tree!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One railway employee responsible for opening and closing the barriers (how he is supposed to do that in time on a typical oval track included in&nbsp;those lego trains is anyone&#39;s guess) in a blue&nbsp;suit and red hat. I was convinced there was another minifigure with a&nbsp;red bicycle (4719c01) included as &quot;traffic&quot; but both bricklink and peeron seem to&nbsp;deny this, I still have the bicycle though&nbsp;and wouldn&#39;t know where else we could have it from. We certainly did not have any of those sets that used to include this red bicycle so rather than solving a mystery I have one more now.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Well, &quot;hardly there&quot; seems to be a good description. Take your baseplate, lay the track and ramps, set up the barriers and then you can build the small control tower for the guard. So two points in total seems about right here. Luckily that&#39;s not the main purpose of this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A nice way to integrate your train track with your city grid, it&#39;s always fun to stage traffic accidents and what can top a train slamming into some cars at full speed? Too bad the barriers won&#39;t see much use since you&#39;d have to get over there and lower/raise them manually every time a train passes - which means: you&#39;ll never do it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While we all would want the #7866 not everyone wants to pay the price that set demands, so this is a cheap(er) alternative: this manual crossing can be&nbsp;yours for about a fourth of what #7866 would set you back, still rather expensive for what you get but at least more manageable. And again, you can&#39;t have a railroad without a road crossing!</p>
