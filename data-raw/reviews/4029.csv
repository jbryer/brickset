<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This freight loading depot comes with a nice little building, a crane, and an extra wagon. It makes heavy use of the 1983 new parts (space supports, sliding doors, door rail plates). And there are three trans-clear 1x4 bricks without inner tubes, that are unique to this set. Usually they were used for space sets with trans-yellow color.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are no known variants of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This is a little gem. It is not that big, but has great parts and an extra wagon (as the first one of only three grey era sets). Other parts like the crane bucket and the tipper ends were really old, even at time of release. But again, the set is missing the conducting rails. I cannot see the logic behind it, why some sets were equipped with them while others weren&#39;t.</p>
