"Novelty","2007-04-30T06:54:00.2Z","Puff the magic dragon?","This is the Black Knights' version of the dragon head boat and it seems a little bit more comical than the previous incarnation of the boat.  Still it's a good solid design, with paddles at the back, a barrel, two minifigs and a dragon head that seems less like a dragon and more a disney horse.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jd5775","2007-08-08T23:27:13.037Z","Great","This is one of the best castle sets of all time! Two minifigs and a small boat for like $4.25.  A great way to make an army of minifigs and an armada of little boats.  The helmet on the guy holding the shield is too specialized to be in mass however;  Kind of like those obnoxious Redbeards and British soldier captains (that come in every pirate/imperial guard set...)  Anyway switch the helmets and your good to go.  I recommend buying this set, but only if you plan to buy it in mass. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-22T18:11:09.5Z","Cool Boat for knights","This set is from the black knights subtheme, from the castle theme, and was released in the year of 1993. The set looks like small and is really small. But the design, altough like some old set building, is nice. The two black knight minifigures are simple but awesome, due to the design of their bodies, shields, spears and helmets, all in a color scheme that makes it better. The building of the boat is also simple, due to the size, but works correctly, and also the color scheme. The front of the boat have a simple dragon head, builted with some few and useful pieces. It not looks like much a dragon, like the dragon heads later used in the dragon knights subtheme sets, due to the size, because this dragon head is in a good weight for the boat, to makes it stay well in a good position. So, the building is easy and as a result, is a nice designe set. The playability is also basic like other small boats from this theme. So, i rate this 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
