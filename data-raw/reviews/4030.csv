"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-12T17:27:22Z","Amazing set","This building fits perfectly next to a train station. I think it really looks good. Take a look at all those details: The car, the signs etc. Also I like the control station. As you can see, the car drive under it, which always was fun as I played with this set years ago. And although it looks not very stable, it truely is ;-)

The reason for giving this car transport depot only 8 points is the following cons:

 - There is just one car. A second one would have pleased me!
 - The rails are connected with the platform. This made trains fall from the rails sometimes when passing the depot with highspeed.
 - The biggest mistake: some trains partly crashed into the tower, because the room between the rails and the depot wasn't always big enough for some trains.

Of course the last two points can be solved manually but still it's a little silly of Lego. Could have been a 9/10 at least!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T15:46:44Z","One of the best train buildings ever","This set easily smokes all the 90s train buildings in the pipe. The yellow square for the car is extremely cool as is the whole structure. The platform can be moved towards the wagon - nice. There are lots of small red fences. Probably the freight Loading Depot is still a dot better but this is one of those sets that actually make sense to have in your city/train collection.  80s train sets are special in any way. I still need the red Electric Passenger Train!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Set type: building<br />
Generation (within grey era): 3.5<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This is an impressive car loading platform, with a clever sliding mechanism. There is a special flatbed wagon and a white car. It is the third building of the grey era which comes with a n additional freight wagon.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are different versions of the conducting rails: Either with or without holes, but always with additional reinforcements at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
It&#39;s hard to find appropriate words. This set looks nice, works well, and it is a perfect link between trains and classic town.But for me, it is not as fascinating as other sets are.</p>

"badger740671","2009-05-14T09:15:31.2Z","Great, but...","I love this set. It was one of the first train themed non train included set I was lucky to get. It is a great set, and a brilliant addition to a town (not city - this is the 80's not the modern stuff!)

My critisim with this set is this. The deck that slides out is a great design and works well, but considering the instructions require the builder to attach the track to the base, the gap is on 2 or 3 bricks away from the wagon! This was an oversight I feel but easy to rectify. It did not utilise the brilliant deck enough!

Having said that, I love it. If it comes up on ebay I am always keen to see the interest as it very rarely seems to appear.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"FlyBy","2012-01-09T23:02:19.41Z","Load 'em Up","I remember getting this set as a little kid in the late 80's shortly after getting my 4.5v steam cargo train. I recently just pulled my whole Lego collection out of storage and assembled this loading platform tonight. As others here have said, nothing beats the sets from the 80's.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Simple to build and the detail is great for its time. Sure the train car only holds one car, but you could always add another rail car of your own creation to expand. This is certainly hard to find, and even harder to find in the box, but is a great addition to any train set old or new.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
