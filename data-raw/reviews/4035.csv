Important for what they do, these come across&nbsp;as very well made. They form a reliable surface for your engineers to use or &#39;build&#39; in place. The metal feels bolted straight on to tough plastic though care should be taken of such pieces.</p>

<p>The 12V system is still popular and had some great sets. With these rails along with power and the control accessories it really does transform; your railway, Lego landscapes and the whole feeling of the hobby. The electric sets always seemed to come with a particular smell (it wasn&#39;t burning dust was it?) and you now had an automatic movement and action with which your people could interact. A heavy industrial machine in most cases and very impressive when trundling around.</p>

<p>These are worth a critical point in that they are chunky but compared to the modern segemented effect railway sleeper I&nbsp;found them preferable.</p>

<p>Straights are the start, you will need all the curves too. Good luck!</p>
