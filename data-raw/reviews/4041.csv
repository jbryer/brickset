All of my Lego stuff is from 1978-1979, so I assume my storage cloth is this ""786-1: Storage Cloth"" from 1979.

It's a pretty innovative storage solution I suppose.  The problem is that it does not hold its shape like a solid box does.  So when you try to put it on a shelf or on the closet floor, it spreads out when you set it down.  Also,  you really can't secure it.  You just pull up the drawstring that goes all the way around it and carry it off.  Maybe it needs a twist tie like a sack of bread!  It might work best if you hooked it onto a hanger of some sort and hung it on a closet clothes rod.

The  advantage of the storage cloth is you can spread out all your Legos and dig through them.  Then when you are done, you don't have to put them back into any container, you just grab the drawstrings and go.

So it makes for fast easy cleanup, but it's probably not the best storage solution.  

Anyways, my Lego's have been at my parents house, in a closet, in this storage cloth for 30 years. .... So as a 3 decade ""archive"" storage device, it worked!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
