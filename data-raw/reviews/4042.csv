Featuring red and green lights which could be changed via a control unit, this wasn&rsquo;t simply pretty track-side decoration, but a fully working signal which could remotely halt your train at the press of a button, and at a location of your choice.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The contents of the set are sparse in number, with the bulk of it taken up with more specialised pieces, such as the signal control unit, wires and the (heavily) modified 2x3 brick housing the red and green lights. The latter is a thing of beauty &ndash; looking like a realistic signal housing, but also still part of the Lego world via the studs on the back.</p>

<p>Even the signal gantry is new, with the long lattice train signal mast and the accompanying stand making their debut in this set (they would pop up in a few other 12v era train sets as well as rather randomly in a Model Team set in 1994).</p>

<p>It also included pieces to make up two lengths of straight track, but with one important difference &ndash; the standard issue power rails were replaced by two &lsquo;breaker rails&rsquo;, more of which later&hellip;</p>

<h3>Instructions / The build</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;build&rsquo; (such as it is) is over in seven steps, and even that feels over-long. The rest of the thin instruction booklet is taken up with a series of increasingly convoluted diagrams explaining how to set up, wire and control the lights. As a child, these seemed fairly confusing and so for years I only controlled the lights, stopping the train manually at the signal point using the power control unit. As an adult I am ashamed that I could ever have been that dense and, for those who were brighter than myself, they will have done the job!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There are two plug points on the same side of the special breaker rails, which enables the power to be conducted between those two sections of rail, or routed around it and thereby stopping the train only when it enters the &lsquo;dead&rsquo; section. The set works like a dream, with a single button on the control unit both cutting the power and simultaneously turning the signal to red.</p>

<p>The instructions note that if you are running your trains fast (and what child doesn&rsquo;t?), the breaker rails should be positioned further apart as trains could overshoot the &lsquo;dead&rsquo; bit of track if the rails are positioned directly after one another.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It was a shame that these and other similar functional accessories (such as remotely controlled points and de-couplers) were rendered obsolete by the &lsquo;upgraded&rsquo; 9V train system in the early 1990s. Sets like this showed the possibilities of a more advanced remotely operated system, moving beyond the push trains of the younger age demographic, and more exciting and challenging than the simple speed control that has been offered in sets since 1991.</p>

<p>The set is beautifully designed, understated in aesthetics, but performing a relatively complex function simply and smoothly. 35 years on, my set is still working perfectly &ndash; in fact I now have multiples so that I can control trains stopping at stations, on passing loops, and to stop collisions at the right-angle crossing points.</p>

<p>It was this set that unlocked the key to running multiple trains on a larger layout than I could have dreamed of before and, as such, it fully deserves its reputation as an essential part of any 12v train collection.</p>

Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: supplemental<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
When Lego introduced the grey era, they did not just release a wave of new sets. Instead, they invented a system. While the look and feel was still like Lego, the features came close to the standards of regular model train systems. Digital systems were still far off, therefore analog was state of the art. The signal kit allows to separate a track section which is powered individually. The power is controlled using the remote switch, and the lights are switched according to the power state.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are at least three different types of the interrupted conducting rail:</p>

<ul>
	<li>interrupted at the middle, no triangle pattern</li>
	<li>- interrupted at the middle, with triangle pattern</li>
	<li>- interrupted at the end, with triangle pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, the remote switch exists in two different hardware variants:</p>

<ul>
	<li>early type, no groove at the back of the case, contacts with visible metal rings</li>
	<li>later type, two-studs groove at the back of the case, contacts without visible metal rings</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1980 to 1988, the box was made of styrofoam with a cardbox sleeve. From 1989, the box was redesigned without styrofoam.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Features like the signal, are one of the main reasons why the grey era is considered as the greatest Lego train period. The 9 volt system may have an improved track system, but all remote features were dropped. In pre-digital times, dividing the track into individually powered sections, was the only way to handle more than one train.</p>
