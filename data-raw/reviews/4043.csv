Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: supplemental<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): none</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
There were only three sets that were equipped with lights: 7740, 7745 and 7750. But Lego offered this little upgrade kit, which contains four light bricks, four cables and the special prism holder bricks. But the usage wasn&#39;t restricted to trains and wagons, the set can also be used to illuminate buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
Early versions of the light bricks have only 2 plug holes and smooth glass, while later versions have an additional center hole and diffuse glass.<br />
Moreover, there are at least two different instruction booklets. One shows how to upgrade set 7725 (1981-1984) while the other one shows how to upgrade set 7735 (1985-1990). As set 7725 has been released in 1981, I am wondering if there is a third version that reflects year 1980.<br />
From 1980 to 1988, the box was made of styrofoam with a cardbox sleeve. From 1989, the box was redesigned without styrofoam.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Another proof of how Lego ran the system approach. You could start with a push-a-long train and upgrade everything. some sets are very well prepared for the lights kit, which means that the look doesn&#39;t change. Other sets require greater modifications and therefore change the look significantly. The following lists shows my personal opinion:<br />
7710 modifications required<br />
7715 modifications required<br />
7720 fits in very smoothly<br />
7722 modifications required<br />
7725 fits in very smoothly<br />
7727 modifications required<br />
7730 fits in very smoothly<br />
7735 modifications required<br />
7755 modifications required<br />
7760 fits in very smoothly<br />
7810 modifications required</p>
