<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
Introduced in 1981, this set enhances your train layout bay a remote-controlled decoupling unit. It is the only remote-controlled element that did not last until 1990, because it was dropped from the line-up in 1985.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
No variants or alternate parts are known for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This is the only item of the grey era which is a little bit flawed. It works fine, as long everything is adjusted perfectly. If this isn&#39;t the case, there will be problems and malfunction. Maybe this was the reason why it was discontinued after 1984.</p>
