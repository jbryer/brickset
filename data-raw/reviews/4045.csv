Year of release: 1980<br />
Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: supplemental<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />
Successor (within grey era): 1239</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This set is an upgrade for set 7856, because 7856 and 2x 7863 = 7858 and 7859.<br />
At the end of 1984, it disappeared from the catalog. However, the 1985 service sheet shows set 1239 which has exactly the same contents.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
In general, the remote switch exists in two different hardware variants:</p>

<ul>
	<li>early type, no groove at the back of the case, contacts with visible metal rings</li>
	<li>later type, two-studs groove at the back of the case, contacts without visible metal rings</li>
</ul>

<p>But it is hard to say if this set is affected by the two variants, due to its limited selling period from 1980 to 1984.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Another proof of the system idea. If you started with 7856 instead of 7858/7859, you still had the chance to upgrade.</p>
