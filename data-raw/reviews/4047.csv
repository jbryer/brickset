Last year in catalog: 1990<br />
Set type: supplemental<br />
Generation (within grey era): 1.0<br />
Predecessor (within grey era): none<br />

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
This set was both intended as spare part and as upgrade kit. Besides the motor itself, it contains two weight bricks and some decorative parts that are useful for steam engines.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are two version of the steam cylinder element, with or without interior grooves.<br />
The motor itself exists in four different versions, but only three were used until 1990:</p>

<ul>
	<li>power connector without center hole, integrated pin on top</li>
	<li>power connector with center hole, integrated pin on top</li>
	<li>power connector with center hole, separated pin on top</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1980 to 1988, the box was made of styrofoam with a cardbox sleeve. From 1989, the box was redesigned without styrofoam.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
If you need to replace a non-working black motor, you needed this set. But when talking about the upgrade scenario, I never understood why they put a black motor into this set. Because 7720 is the only upgrade-able set that requires a black motor. All other upgrade-able sets (7710, 7715, 7722 and 7810) are steam engines, therefore they would require a red motor.</p>
