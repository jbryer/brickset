The very good thing of this set is that you can built either a one-rail-crossing or a two-rail-crossing. Instructions for both are included. Any tires are hidden very good as well!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>This railroad crossing is likely to be the pinnacle of the 12 volt lego train era. It features all elements that make the 12 volt system so attractive;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remote operated controlled gates and flashing lights</li>
	<li>nice design of operators house (still contemporary on todays train layouts)</li>
	<li>Double track railroad crossing</li>
	<li>customizable wiring</li>
	<li>Very attractive packaging</li>
	<li>Many interesting parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly</p>

<p>Assembly&nbsp;is easy and does not take a lot of time, I do like the smart routing of the wiring under the track, interesting is the special sleepers with cut-outs for the wiring. The controller&#39;s house is built on&nbsp;a separate&nbsp;small base plate, so no small, but a decent work environment for our operator</p>

<p>Durability</p>

<p>The set is pretty durable, the same relay module used in the points is used which uses magnetism, it is durable and has few moving parts making them last a very long time. My set is mint in the box complete with instruction booklet and promotional folder from 1983. After 27 years it is still in operation on my 12 volt railroad. I have seen full size railroad crossings that lasted less longer.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
Another set from 1983, that had a really long life span until 1990. There are lots of special parts that were never used in other sets. Never before something similar had been released, and never again until now. The instructions show two alternate builds, either with one lane or with two lanes.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
There are no known variants of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
Are you looking for a classic 1980s set with a great amount of single-used special parts? Well, try this one. Light bricks, crossing sign, flash light unit, but of course all of them are necessary to enable the special features.<br />
And thankfully, the set is equipped with conducting rails.</p>
