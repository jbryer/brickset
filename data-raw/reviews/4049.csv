<p><strong>Description</strong><br />
In addition to 7861, this set was intended to light up your track. It contains four light bricks and train signal masts. Of course, you can also light up your buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Variants and alternate parts</strong><br />
As it was released in 1983, the light bricks must be always the newer version with three plug holes.<br />
From 1980 to 1988, the box was made of styrofoam with a cardbox sleeve. From 1989, the box was redesigned without styrofoam.</p>

<p><strong>Personal opinion</strong><br />
This is a nice add-on, because it adds realism. But if your track is lying on the floor, be careful when stepping over it...</p>
