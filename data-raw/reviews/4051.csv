It's not a huge set, and it won't win any awards, but it expanded Life on Mars theme, which was very underated, to have more.

The aliens are some of the best Lego has made, the arms and legs and head move wonderfully.  I wish they would have used this type in Mars Mission.  The Asternaut is nothing special, but at least you get three minifigs for cheap.

The human mini set is the worst in the bunch, there isn't a lot to say.  It's a small rover, nothing big.  The alien miniset is very nicely done considering the limited number of pieces in the set.  These sets were for being sold at super markets and gas stations, they get the job done.

The best set is obviously the bigger alien set on the bottom, it fits into the mech type feel that Life on Mars had.  The only thing is that it has one &quot;leg&quot; instead of too and that makes it look a little weird.

The whole theme didn't seem to sell well, I got the base for $25, but it did lead way to Mars Mission, which I think is worse, and even to Exo-force in a way with the mechs.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I really liked the rover with the cool wheels. The other sets weren't bad either. If you liked Life on Mars, you should have this by now.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legomaniac101","2013-05-11T23:32:39.557Z","Three little great sets in one box.","I bought this set off of e-bay a couple of years back,since the auction was at a low price and the boxes were in good shape. I may or may not review the actual sets at another time (even though the name of this review basically gives away my opinion on those three sets),so this review will simply cover whether this is worth your money and the design of the box. The big box that the set's actual boxes are in is very nice. The side of the big box contains a beautiful shot of the martian landscape behind the copyright (which I doubt few people read),ad for Lego.com,etc. The set's actual boxes are all very nice. The instructions for each set are in their individual box. Overall,I'm glad I bought this since I like the Life On Mars theme and since the Double Hover and Rover aren't very common sets in this theme.<br>",TRUE,5,3,5,3,5
