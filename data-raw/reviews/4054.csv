<p>Parts/components and building experience</p>

<p>Let us start with what you&acute;ll get This set only comes with one parts the Storage cloth so not much for building.</p>

<p>Function</p>

<p>This&nbsp;set is very well thought&nbsp;out since it is used for moving your LEGO bricks&nbsp;around. The function works well you just dump your LEGO bricks&nbsp;on to the cloth. When you have done that and are ready do carry away&nbsp;the Storage cloth to another part of your house or where your store LEGO stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry it you have to drag in five or more strings from different ends of the cloth. How many strings you have to drag depends on how much you carry in it.</p>

<p>My opinion</p>

<p>The storage cloth is a good storage device but if you want to solve it the best place to put it is by hanging it by a hook. I like the feature because it works very well with this set. I have used thi cloth several&nbsp;times and it works well. The storage cloth is easy to use so it is a great gift to any kid&nbsp;is good tool to help out&nbsp;cleaning your room. &nbsp;I really recommend picking it up from Bricklink or Ebay&nbsp;if you have the chance&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set may be limited to a single piece, but for someone such as myself (an AFOL) the storage cloth represents the device throughout my childhood&nbsp;that delivered the&nbsp;world of imagination and possibility that LEGO provides. Growing up I have very fond memories of opening this bag&nbsp;full&nbsp;of LEGO, placing it on the floor and feeling like I was surrounded in bricks and&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<p>What&#39;s most&nbsp;impressive is that&nbsp;the exact&nbsp;same storage cloth purchased&nbsp;by my parents so many years ago&nbsp;has consistently served as a LEGO play-mat and storage solution for well over 30 years, and is now still being used by my nieces and nephews! And it&#39;s pretty incredible value, considering my parents got this storage cloth as a free promotional&nbsp;item when purchasing another LEGO set.</p>

<p>In summary, sure&nbsp;it&#39;s just a bag, but what this bag represents is pure magic to anyone who grew up with one. It also provides the perfect &#39;LEGO on the go&#39; solution which it deserves credit for. Plus, in terms of value for money, mine seems to have lasted remarkably well given the amount of playtime it&#39;s seen over the years.</p>

<p>Long live the&nbsp;LEGO storage cloth!</p>
