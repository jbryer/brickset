-More lego compatible than the galidor happy meal toys.
-Interesting pieces that are challenging to find uses for(Head for a giant(minifig scale)alien, Feet for booster rockets, and a soccer ball spherical warp core?)

The Bad:
-That stupid kicking leg and the lack of an appendage on one side.
-Stickers, not only stickers but lousy ones.
-Doesnt really work.

The Ugly:
-The fact that at the time lego wouldnt give actual bricks in macdonalds releases",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

<p>I was at the same flea market that I found Euripides in (see my other review), and while looking through a box I discovered a copy of this set. The owner was only asking for a dollar for it, so naturally I accepted. Let&rsquo;s get on with my review, shall we?</p>

<p><b>The Figure Itself:</b></p>

<p>This is one strange set. It consists of 4 pieces: a head &amp; torso, legs you can&rsquo;t move, a third leg (for the play feature), and an extremely large soccer ball. I don&rsquo;t know if the head and hair can be taken apart, and I have decided not to check due to my fear of breaking it. The figure is made of decent quality plastic, and the only printing is on the face. There is a molded Lego logo on the back of the torso piece, as well as on the soccer ball. The ball is made of two pieces screwed together.&nbsp;The set comes with two stickers: one &ldquo;4&rdquo; to place on the torso, and another one to place on the third leg. I can&rsquo;t tell what it is, but basically it&rsquo;s a bunch of grey lines on a white background. This set also comes with a paper goal for you to kick the ball into, which is a mediocre piece.</p>

<p><b>Building Experience:</b></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t really build this set, you just connect the parts. The instructions are confusing, and I have yet to figure out how to set up&nbsp;the goal.</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>The only way this set can be used with actual lego is the fact that there are anti-studs on the bottom of the feet, though I have yet to test this on a baseplate. The other parts are basically unusable. Still, they are exclusive to this set (I believe).</p>

<p><b>Playability:</b></p>

<p>Small children could have a &ldquo;ball&rdquo; with this set (see what I did there?!). The play feature is well done, and kicking the ball around is a little fun. You just press down on the head, and the third leg kicks. Other than that, this set is pretty boring. It is a free McDonald&rsquo;s toy, so who can complain?</p>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p>This is a semi-high quality Lego toy from McDonald&rsquo;s. It is worth picking up, because of all the weird and exclusive parts you get with it. But on eBay, they sell for a lot more than&nbsp;I bought it for, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth more than 3$, so&nbsp;only buy if you find it dirt cheap like I did. If you ever go to a flea market or antique store, it might be worth digging through the old happy meal toy box. Thank you for reading my review.</p>
