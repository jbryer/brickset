And what's up with the creepy knock-off Bratz girl picture on the top of it? I was so creepy that I tore it off and replaced it with a horse picture. Ahh, much better!</p><p>So, all in all, at least it's useful for storing my jewelry, but couldn't any toy company have made a pink jewelry box? Just wondering what Lego was thinking when they made these sets!<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
