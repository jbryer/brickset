MINUS: 
   
     not good for SYSTEM collectors
     boring set

"legolord909","2007-08-25T21:08:08.317Z","Dissapointing","I was very dissapointed with this set.  Many  things need to be improved.  I got this set for only $15.oo(USD) on eBay and I thought I was getting a great set.  Now, I see why it was only 15 bucks.  To start off, the button on the top of its head doesn't work.  They kept on advertising on the box how it makes the droid fold up.  I kept trying it, and it did nothing.  But the most annoying thing for me is that it won't stand up.  It takes me about twenty tries to get it to not fall over.  On the flip side though, it is very fun to build and has a decent amount of pieces.  But I still think Lego should have made a different Technic in its place.  Something like a Boba Fett Technic might be nice.  They made a Jango Technic, so why not a Boba?  Overall, the Pit Droid is not a great set.  Save your money, don't buy this one.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2008-12-14T22:28:33.187Z","Not a rewarding set to build...","I have to agree with legolord909's review of this set.  After spending a few hours assembling, I was very disappointed with the outcome.  

As mentioned, I cannot get my droid to stand up-- even if I do, it only lasts for a few seconds.  I have the battle droid technic set, and he stands fine, so...

Next, people have mentioned the button not working for the pop-up feature.  Worse than that, my pit droid will not even assume his collapsed position.  He almost does, then springs back upright.  I have double-checked my work, and the set is assembled correctly.  

Don't waste your time with this set.  Although the green/tan color, and design of his head are cool, this set overall is not rewarding.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"VideoGameLord613","2008-08-06T16:11:20.343Z","&quot;Hey, hit the nose&quot;","This is a very cool set.It looks  better than the minifigure. (I do not have it, but I have seen it.)
Pros:
Unfolds when you press the nose
Nose looks cool
High playability
Lots of fun
Spear and Hammer add in a little effect

Cons:
Sometimes doesn't want to stand for display
Rubber bands for        can come off easily",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-06T07:10:08.39Z","LEGO Star Wars - Pit Droid Review","This is my only set which I got from the LEGO Star Wars (Technic) theme. It's a good set but it's not my favourite. This figure is part of the movie ""Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" and it's called a pit droid. The design of the droid is very good and it's a great built. The only problem is that this figure can't stay very well. The main play feature of the pit droid is that you can fold it together just like we've seen in the movie. You have to lift the legs of this figure up and then you push the head of that droid down. It's a really cool set to have but as I told you: It's not my favourite one.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Unqualified_AT_AT_Driver","2012-04-28T03:05:13.123Z","Great Set To Display, But Not So Great If You Want To Play......","<p>I have to say that even though this set let me down when I initially purchased it (believing that it would fold up and then stand back up again hassle-free) a few years back, looking at it now, I can't help but notice how much of a great display set this is. It always attracts attention from my family and friends and they are almost always able to spot it as Pit Droid from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. <br></p><p>The only real bad thing about it nowadays is that the rubber bands holding all the joints in place are starting to degrade. This might of been from me playing around with it too much but on the plus side, Lego seems to have known that the rubber bands wouldn't of lasted too long and deiced to include a fair few spare ones.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great Display Set<br></li><li>Some Really Unique Technic Pieces.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Pretty Much No Playability Unless You Are Willing To Replace The Rubber Bands Every Second Day.<br></li><li>It Needs Something To Lean Against In Order For It To Stand Up.<br></li></ul>
<p>To conclude, this isn't the greatest Star Wars Technic set; there are ones out there that have much greater playability than this one. For a set that is fun (and nostalgic) to build though and is a nice small set to display, I would recommend it to anyone that is a Lego Star Wars fan or is just a fan of Star Wars in general. I would personally have to give it 4 out of 5 bricks.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,2,4
