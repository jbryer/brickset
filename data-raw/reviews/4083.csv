The blaster is good and the droid can reach back and pull it out of his &quot;backpack&quot; if need be! This one of my shorter reveiews but I cannot go into too much detail for technic sets!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-16T17:37:34Z","one of the only technics that look like what there suppost to be.","As the title says this set looks almost right out of the movie. the only thing inaccurate is the blaster rifle is too small its the size of a large pistle not a large rifle. besides that the set was extrmly well put together.  except wen i built it i was like 10 so i really screwed up wen first tryin to build it. (in other words wen i tryed to fold it up it snaped in half.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

You get a really cool battle droid with a gun and moving arms. The gun looks very cool and doesn't want to be messed with. Lego did a good job on this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>While my experience was somewhat unsettled due to a few missing pieces, the build itself was actually really fun, and made a great change from the usual&nbsp;non-technic star wars sets i&#39;m used to building. One feature during this I really enjoyed was the inclusion of different colours for some of the elements, that allowed you to change the rank of the droid, which was a really great feature to include.</p>

<p>While I can&#39;t comment on the value for money,since I didn&#39;t have to pay for it,&nbsp;if you are able to pick one up then it is really worth it, as while it looks great as a display piece, the features such as being able to close up and reach for it&#39;s weapon are really nice and add an extra element to it that really bring it alive as a giant figure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While pieces&nbsp;wise there isn&#39;t anything particularly special, unless you count the magnets and the huge amount of tan technic elements, it is well worth getting as a display piece, even if the weapon isn&#39;t quite the right size for the film.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>looks good, and very much resembles the one in the film</li>
	<li>good play ability</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>not entirely movie accurate,</li>
	<li>second hand elastic bands may need replacing, as they are under alot of strain when in standing position</li>
</ul>
