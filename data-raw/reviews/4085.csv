"Blade","2007-08-06T11:43:30.55Z","Mini Technic Racer","This is one of the spin off models from the short lived robo riders series. This could be the coolest of the four? &quot;Lava&quot; the Red Racer a really cool look and wicked independent rear wheel suspension. Going with the red and black colour scheme is what you would expect but anything else would have been lame.

Once you over look this cool suspension and fiery look the model doesn't really have much more to offer. It can be used with some of the slammer series but the rubber tires on grey pins dont help for distance.

Overall I still like this model and adds to the collection of these four minis. Overall this one is scraping a 6/10. would have been higher but this model could have gone so much further.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This have different wheels, not the same that can be launched in the robo rider series. The pieces are useful, for bionicle, the series that preceded it and technic. This is one little technic like the promotional motorcycle of shell petrol. The building is easy and fast, and to make creations of it too, because it have few pieces. I rate it 5/5, good for a small technic set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-22T10:27:37.51Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Volcano Climber Review","This is a fun little set to have and it's also very fun to play with. This model is very easy to build and it's very easy to maneuver as well. We also don't get any stickers to worry about. The only play feature which this set has is that you get a suspension for the tyres on the back, because of the rubber band on each side.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun little model to have - even 
for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own 
creations).<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
