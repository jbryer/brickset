"Blade","2007-08-06T11:31:31.16Z","Mini Technic Dirt Bike","This is one of the spin off models from the short lived robo riders series. This particular one is the dirt bike &quot;Power&quot;. He has a black and yellow colour scheme which really reminds me so some of the Suzuki bikes. Twin exhausts look kind nice.

The best part of this model is the winder which allows you to shape the bike from flat to bent like a folding bed. This allows you to set it to whichever angle you desire. also the looseness of the gear system makes it look like the bike has suspension. 

This model has no real flaws so yeah im going to give it a 6/10 or above average as i am becoming more fond of bikes due to my current ownership of two.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Another set that have pieces too included and others that like them, and in the same time is yellow and small is the motorcycle from the promo of the shell petrol. The wheels are two, when in the small version that looks like lava is four. Basically, it is a small set and can be builted fast, sometimes without the instructions. Little versions are too released as promotionals, like this, released with kabaya sweets in japan. This isn't the more great set, but is cool for a small one, so, i rate it with 5/5...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-21T10:16:05.293Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Dirt Bike Review","This is a fun little model to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is quick and simple and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set is also very easy to maneuver. On the back is a gear which you can use to move the tyre on the back up and down. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun little model to have - even for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations).<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
