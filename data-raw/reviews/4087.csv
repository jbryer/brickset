"Blade","2007-08-05T11:53:03.833Z","Mini Technic Helicopter","This is one of the spin off models from the short lived robo riders series. Its a basic technic helicopter. It has two lasers, a spinning gear rotor and spinning tail blade. 

It's an ok little model but one small thing annoys me. If you wish to turn the knob to make the rotor spin you mush have you hand come from underneath. What im trying to say is there isn't really enough clearance for your hand.

Overall an ok little model nothing overly special about it but the colour scheme of white black and blue is a favourite of mine so i give this one a 6/10. Seen better but seen alot worse.

Get if you like technic, helicopters or robo riders, that's it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-22T19:38:22.84Z","Robo Flyer","This is a small version of roboriders, this don't rides, but fly. This is cool, have useful pieces, like the parts too included on the star wars' lightsabers, and pieces that connect weapons of bionicle. The colors likes to be of a robo in the environment of ice, mouintains, or things to like that. The helicopter can be played easily, and with a fast building, can be mixed to make a creation. This looks like be the smaller version of the frost roborider, have it's name on head. Compatible with bionicle or technic, or sometimes with lego system, this is useful, playable, and in the same time small. I will rate it 5/5, a rate that this deserves comparision with small sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-21T10:11:13.053Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Ice Explorer Review","This is a nice little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very quick and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. On each side you can see a laser and on one side is a gear which makes the blades sviwel full 360Â°. As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations).<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
