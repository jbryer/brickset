It comes with FOUR green light sabers! It comes with two roborider discs as well as a roborider head. It also has wheels on the back. I'm not sure what there for since it seems that this set is supposed to fly.....

"Blade","2007-08-14T09:37:38.007Z","Mini Technic Swamp Surfer","This is one of the spin off models from the short lived robo riders series. This is the fourth and final one of the mini models dug out of the box. Frankly this one is a disappointment to me. The face is swamp. It has two long shafts coming out the back with wheels on them which just looks dumb. It has four green rods at the front, which i think are meant to be guns. 

Then you get two robo rider disks for the front wheels, the only one of the four minis that came with rider disks... or did it? I only have one proper robo rider but from what I remember each wheel had a different design. Well guess what? These two wheels are green, just plain green, with no design what so ever. 

Speaking of the front wheels there on hinges so you can adjust the angle. A cool idea, but very unsuited to this model, here it just looks lame. 

There really isn't any more to say about this model. The green rods are the only good bit about this model. The other three resembled a bike, a helicopter, a car and a SWAMP CRAFT? a plane? 

Overall the model sucks and is getting a 3/10 from me. I would seriously only recommend someone who collects robo riders to get this for the point of saying &quot;I have them all&quot; nothing more.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-22T19:52:02.78Z","Like the Roborider Swamp","This set, that like other small from the Roboriders theme, is simple in the building, basic in playability, includes useful pieces and also have a good design. This set looks like the roborider swamp, also due to his &quot;head&quot;, the same of swamp. This includes two big wheels and two small wheels, and all works correctly when it rides. The building is simple and creative. Some useful pieces, like the four green &quot;lasers&quot;, are also used as lightsabers inthe Star Wars theme, and othe&#180;r pieces like the wheels connections can be used in technic and bionicle themes, also can be used in some other lego themes. Overall, this is a small set, a cool small set in playability, like other small technic sets. So, i rate the Swamp Craft 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-22T10:22:28.577Z","LEGO Techni (Robo Riders) - Swamp Craft Review","This is a good little set to have and it's very fun to play with. This set is an easy build and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set is very easy to maneuver as well. The green wheels on each side are able to sviwel and you can also see a laser on each side.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun little model to have - even 
for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own 
creations).<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
