"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-09T20:45:57Z","Very Cool!","     This set, along with Jango Fett, is very detailed and kind of look like the image they are trying to make! This stormtrooper carries a &quot;rifle&quot; that shoots the awesome little darts. The stormtrooper is cool, it is low cost and well worth the technic effort! get it if ya' like stormies!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"VideoGameLord613","2008-08-04T07:59:57.357Z","The one and only 5","This set is great! I agree with the other guy that posted the review! 
Pros:
Looks really like a Stormtrooper!
Has a missle to launch!
Good for teaching your enemies a lesson

Cons:
Sometimes missle doesn't want to go in the gun after shot
Missle could have unexpectedly shot",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I could imagine a possible army with these sets. It is very good and better than 3PO. 5 out of 5 for a great job on this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
