I like the pop out leg and the rotating head. By the way, if you read VideoGameLord's review, tell him R2 does not have a behind. 5 out of 5 for a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TechnicMan","2015-12-04T13:17:56.307Z","Hidden Gem!","<p>I bought this recently on&nbsp;impulse from eBay for a (I thought) reasonable &pound;30, and I&#39;m so glad I did! Although it&#39;s not the most authentic representation of the little droid, the design and features more than make up for it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Mine came with the original box which was in pretty good condition. The front shows the completed model and the back has a nice picture of Artoo with his sidekick C-3P0 as well as some shots from the films and some more demonstrating the play features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great selection of parts, mostly small, but in interesting colours. Lots of white axles, cogs and liftarms,&nbsp;and some nice dark blue pieces as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quite an intricate and tricky build; took me about 50 minutes in all. Some interesting techniques used and the final build is surprisingly robust.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&nbsp;love it! The mechanism to make the third foot pop out is very well designed as it also causes the main feet to tilt backwards into the proper position - very neat! He stands very stable in either position. The head spins around 360 degrees and his tool arm pops out when you push the lever down on the rear.</p>

<p>I love the little cogs that have been used for the wheels and the great use of parts to build the head - it is immediately recognisable&nbsp;as Artoo</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fantastic model and well worth picking up if you can - prices seem to be pretty reasonable on eBay at the moment. Has definitely made me think about getting C-3P0 to keep him company, and that Destroyer Droid looks pretty impressive too...</p>

"Admiral_Kenjin","2009-12-19T16:40:48.077Z","Good Set","I got this one last year (2008) when i was visiting south america. It moves very well, and doesn't come apart easily. it's head can move around 360 degrees and i can change from stationary mode to moving mode. it can also make some sort of port appear by pressing a lever. Overall this is a very good set that i would recommend to anyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
