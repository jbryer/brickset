      Buy it if: you like vader, want all the technic stuff
      Dont buy if: u hate vader, ur u want to get somting more playable, (you better not hate vader cause he rules)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It looks really awesome once built,and is a pretty good likeness(a lot better than Jango,the droids or the stormtrooper) probably due to the cape.
Someone mentioned the red eyes as a problem,but Star Wars nerds will be aware that Vader had red eyes in the first Star Wars movie:Episode 4 A New Hope. If you like Vader and you like LEGO(who doesnt) Id recommend getting it,but only if you like both. Oh yeah,I guess his arms do fall off pretty easily,but dont let that put you off!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Cligra","2011-09-11T19:31:25.293Z","""Impressive. Most impressive.""","<p>This set is definitely visually impressive. Admittedly, is has limited jointing and therefore isn't very playable, but that is more them made up for by its sheer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">presence</span>. It looks amazing, and if you want to get a TECHNIC Star Wars set I would definitely recommend this one over <a title=""View full details of set 8007: C-3PO"" href=""../../detail/?Set=8007-1"">8007</a> or <a title=""View full details of set 8009: R2-D2"" href=""../../detail/?Set=8009-1"">8009</a>, the other two from this theme I have experience with. <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Box has a nice image from the end of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Empire Strikes Back</span>, and the instructions are the usual LEGO high quality.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Vader mainly consists of a bunch of normal TECHNIC parts, but does have a few nice exclusives, such as his helmet and simply enormous cape.<br></p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><h4>Completed Model<br></h4>Like I said, it looks <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">wonderful</span>, but isn't the most playable thing in the world, as it is inflexible and a bit fragile.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Excellent display model, but don't get it if you actually want to play with it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,3
