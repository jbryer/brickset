Me, being on the REpublic side, always despised the Super Battle Droid.  In battlefront, I shoot them for target practice, but in lego, they are quite rare and exquisite.  Technic pieces are the best for maing robots.  They can fit all of the circuits and reactors and details like that!  I have the minifig scale battle droid (Republic Gunship set) and it is pretty flimsy.  This is a very nice model of the SBD and it can be displayed and played with.  I suggest you get the battle droid as well to make a Separatist scene and I wish that lego would  make the technic Clone Trooper. One of my dreams is a set with like 30 stormtroopers or clone troopers or battled droids or Royal guards to build up an awesome army. I hope lego has though of that, it would be the best if that came out! Anyway, this set has the nicest blue touches and the wrist blasters really look cool. You can imagine this droid walking across Geonosis firing it's blaster bolts!  This is a mighty fine set, I well recommend it to any lousy CIS fans!
A touching 9!

The guns on the wrist really makes this model stand out and has every single detail down to the legs. Nice effort on this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-06-28T15:42:00.247Z","Send in the Supers! ","The separatists greatest droid soldier has been encarnated in LEGO! Featureing some rare techno union blue pieces, the technic super battle droid is designed with a clever launching arm mechanism. Also, the model's shoulders, elbows, upper legg joints, knees, and ankles are all 100% posable. Now, on to the construction: if you can handle keeping parts straight before installing important pieces, you shouldn't have much trouble building this set. Another thing is that the bags are numbered for organized construction. Nothing really on the bad side, so let's review the goods and bads: 

Goods: 
-rare pieces 
-launching arm mechanism 
-posable joints 
-numbered bags 

Bads: 
-nothing really 

If you manage to get a hold of this set, you won't be disappointed. I can honestly say that this set is definitely the best out of all the technic sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
