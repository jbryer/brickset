The models on the box really make you want to build them. It has everything you need and nothing you don't. Technic fans should get or have this by now.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This was my first Lego Set, and I will forever be in love with it. 

So basic and yet so complete, it has everything you want, cars, helicopters, a windmill, and more models on the pictures from the boxes that you want to build and do not have the instructions for.

Excellent to have your not so little kids to like Lego. 

It is not that expensive and easy to find through ebay. Buy it if you see it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ra226","2012-03-01T00:20:20.01Z","An excellent starter Technic set","This was my first Technic set, and it's an excellent primer for the world of Technic. &nbsp;A child (or adult) can learn about rack and pinion systems, gear reduction systems (and the trade off of speed vs. torque), and bevel gears which let you change the direction of rotation.<div><br></div><div>Unlike many Technic sets this size, this one can build several models, and most are not just variations on the same model. &nbsp;You have a van with front steering, a bulldozer with rear stearing, a wind mill with a high gear ratio (making it spin quite fast compared to a turn of the crank), a helicopter, and a few others. &nbsp; (I have reduced the ""building experience"" rating by one because 3 models, while physically different, are pretty much the same thing, gearing-wise: a front-stearing ground vehicle). &nbsp;There are also enough auxilliary parts to flesh out the creations, too (doors, headlamp bricks, plates).</div><div><div><br></div><div>At 119 pieces, it's one of the smallest Technic sets you can get, but for the price and parts count, it offers a lot of fun and learning. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On a personal note, I've owned many other Technic sets of this generation (8035, 8040, and 8055) but this is the one I remember most as it introduced me to a much larger world of Lego. &nbsp;I also remember how the van model used up all but a few of the pieces.</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"BigLegoKid","2017-01-06T14:32:55.933Z","Best Universal set there was","<p>I got this set back int eh 80&#39;s along with 8030 and soon after that 8040. I built all the models in the set many times and played with them all extensively. Unlike my 8040 set i built the windmill in the 8020 many times and played with it very often. I modified it in may ways trying to make a &quot;Fan&quot; and get the blades to spin faster. I ended up breaking a few gears&nbsp;in my attempts.I used the parts form 8040 to make a larger version also.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build methods and concepts learned form this set where the most valuable when using all my universal sets to make my own creations.&nbsp;</p>
