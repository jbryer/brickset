"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T10:08:21Z","My first Technic set","This was my very first Technic Set and the 4th Technic in my family, because my mother owns some Technic sets too. Well I got this set back in about 1994, when I was six years. 
I'll now rate the 4 Models that can be built with this set and calculate the whole score for the set:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Plane:
This is just a simple plane, which has only one function: A rotating propellor. It's a very boxy design , which makes it looking a little bit ugly. But the mechanism for the propellor is really good for such a small model. If there would be a better design f the plane it would've scored better.
Score: 7/10
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Tow Truck:
This is The best model in this set. It has two nice functions, like the steering and a towing mechanism.
The towing mechanism is powered by gears, but the tow itself has no rope, which limits it's functionality. The steering is powered by just a classic steering installation common to many technic and large Vehicle sets. Simply the steering is on top of the vehicle.
Score: 9/10
-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Robot?:
I don't like this model very much. It seems to resemble a robot and has simultaneous moving features, which makes it pretty toy-ish. The mechanism for the moving features is pretty good, but common to some earlier childhood toys. It's wheel powers the moving arm and the moving head but all moving features only work simutaneously.
Score: 6/10
-----------------------------------------------------------
4. Racecar:
This is a good model, but lacks functions. It only has a steering and nothing else. Well the back is really good looking, altough boxy. The cockpit is too basic, but hey it's an older set. You can even motorize it, which is a good feature to this model.
Score 8/10
-----------------------------------------------------------
Overall: 7,5/10 but topped to an solid 8 
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is a good starter set, but lacks details and some slope bricks for making the plane look better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I loved it and it began my love affair with Lego and technic specially. The models are not very complicated or functional. As mentioned in other reviews the tow truck is the best one to make. The robot is the worst and the plane follows. Im really glad Technic went in the direction of studless beams. I like the clean look that it achieves plus it one builds from the inside out and not just from top to bottom. Overall a good begginner set. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
