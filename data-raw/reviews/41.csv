The column pieces are pretty common in sets now, as is the flat grey piece, but the bridge part was only available here, in two of the Studios sets (2001) and one of the Ferrari sets (2006). There was also a red one in one of the junior Spiderman sets. (This info is from Peeron.)
The problem is, this was an expensive set and you would need quite a few to make an interesting looking bridge. Probably better to use a lot of Technic pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
