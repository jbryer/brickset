<br />
First things first:</p>

<p><br />
Maersk Line&nbsp;based in Copenhagen, Denmark was founded in 1904 by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_M%C3%A6rsk_M%C3%B8ller"" title="""">Peter M&aelig;rsk M&oslash;ller</a>. It&#39;s the world&#39;s largest&nbsp;shipping company since 1996. It employs 83,000 people worldwide and&nbsp;moves over 14 million&nbsp;shipping&nbsp;containers for its customers each year all over the globe. The&nbsp;company&nbsp;serves over 300 ports in 120 countries.</p>

<p>Lego released this Promotional set in 1985.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;m a huge fan of Classic Town and Legoland 4-studs width for all types of vehicles, this beauty was an exception at first sight.<br />
<br />
Design, combination of colours, playability, innovative&nbsp;parts, unique transparent based stickers every single detail is superb!<br />
<br />
One of the very few sets that can be combined between all 4-wide, and up to 6-wide studs vehicles, without having the sense of changing scale.</p>

<p>The main Black and Maersk blue coloured frames of the truck and the two semitrailers&nbsp;use both System and Technic parts in a very discreet way.</p>

<p>The detachable Light Grey containers are scaled to the existing 20&#39;&#39; and 40&#39;&#39; real life ones. This way you can build&nbsp;and fit two 20&#39;&#39; containers in the long 40&#39;&#39; semitrailer using the Maersk blue&nbsp;jumpers (Modified Plate&nbsp;1 x 2 with 1 Stud with Groove).<br />
<br />
The Light Grey and Maersk Blue parts of that era along with the previously released Maersk Lego sets, became &#39;&#39;rare and precious&#39;&#39; immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most iconic and identifying parts are the Light Grey 1x3x5 bricks, the 1x6x5 window with the 1x3x5 window shutters, most of the Maersk Blue parts, even the yellow cupboards with the Maersk stickers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A true collector&rsquo;s item for any Classic Town&nbsp;Lego fan.<br />
<br />
A promotion set created to be given to who knows how many&nbsp;lucky at that&nbsp;time Maersk&nbsp;people.</p>
