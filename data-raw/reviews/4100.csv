"Victor_c3","2012-08-13T11:58:44.907Z","A good beginner's introduction to lego technic","<p>This was one of my first technic sets. Actually, it was my little brother's, but he didn't really gravitate towards legos like I did so I ended up taking it and adding it to my collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This little set, being one of my earliest, was&nbsp;a bit of a chalenge for me. I had no experience with technic at all and I really enjoyed the (simple) stearing mechanism. The helicopter model was fun to build - I remember that clearly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm 32 years old and I'm a parent of two girls (2 and 4 years old). Because this set is so simple by today's standards, I'm probably going to pull out my instructions and go through building the models with them as a good introduction to legos. I'm doing my best to steer my girls into engineering and sciences and I think that this and other universal sets from the time are a great way to inspire kids. My 4 year old can't sit and make any of these models on her own (at least not yet), but with supervision and guidance she can add pieces to the model one step at a time. The pins are a little too hard for her to push into the beams and sliding the gears down the axels sometimes is too hard for her, but that is where dad can help. It is a good way to work on her counting, number recognition, and other critical thought processes. Building these models is sort of like an ""eye spy"" game where you have to identify what is different between your model, the picture of your current step in the instructions, and the previous picture in your instructions. My 2 year old has no concept of numbers, but it is fun watching her try to copy us and grab a gear and an axel and try to jam the gears on the axels in random ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has lego moved away from issuing universal sets? That was a concept that I really enjoyed. The models in universal sets were very simplistic, but with a modest-sized set you were shown how you could make a variety of simple machines.&nbsp;It is no different with this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I remember loving this set as a kid and it is about to get a whole lot of play all over again with my kids as I introduce them to the world of lego technic. Playing with ""daddy legos"" is something that both of my girls and I really enjoy doing. I'm sure it is building a ton of fond memories for all of us and it is a great way for us to connect with each other.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
