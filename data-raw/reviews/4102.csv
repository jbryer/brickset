Instead of saving my money for a couple more weeks and buying a very dusty Lego 912 (the last one in the store!), I blew it on the 8030 in the spring of 1983.  It is a nice little set, just what you'd want if you were sick in bed and didn't feel like building anything in particular.  It (and the 8040 and 8050) are basically supplementary sets; kind of like the 8710 parts repository, just with a few more pieces and instructions.  The 8030 is nothing earthshattering, as you can get all the parts elsewhere, but it's a nice source for extra parts (those that might be missing from other sets).  Obviously I'd much rather have the 912.  6/10.  25 April 2004",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>In&nbsp;particular the 6 wheeler was my favorite&nbsp;model to build nad play with. I built the windmill only once as it was not all that interesting or very playable. The jeep was he most playable but I am not sure why they did not put one of the extra ties on the back to aid in steering it. I added one of them to help and jeeps normally mount the spare back there so doing ti like that was more realistic.</p>
