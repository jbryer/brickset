They are very basic, the jeep can steer (with terrible turning radius) and lower its headligts. It can also be complemented with the electric set for driving the wheels.

The tow-truck has a bit more function with the raising of the ""towing thing"". The helicopter can rotate its lifting rotor and stabilizing rotor.

The 3 other sets I haven't event built because they look too boring, especially the sawing guy because it uses so few parts of the set. Feels like the designers came up with those in the last phase to throw in something more in the building instructions.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
