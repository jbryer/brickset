I still remember I got it from a shopping mall that was not near our house, we had to get there making a long subway trip. It was probably in 1991 or something. I can still remember that on the same day, my mother and grandmother had to undergo a regular breast cancer test. They were okay (they still live today ;-) although my grandmom is sick now; that's why I write this now).
I got it from my grandmother&amp;mother I believe. 

But about the set: it is a nice starter set with loads of nice bricks. The many long yellow beams come in handy and give all the sets a nice &#180;techno-industrial&#180; look. It contains at least six wheels. There are building instructions for the helicopter and the cars you see on the picture. But on the other side of the package there was a picture of a nice mill. I built this mill and put in the electric motor set 8720. It made quite a lot of wind! A great oldtimer!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My favorite model to construct from this set was the windmill.  That is the one model I would construct the most often and it would always be some time before I took it a part.  If I remember correctly, lego did have technic minifigures but they never seemed to release these minfigures with the technic sets.  I remember seeing them in a lego handbook back in the day.  Specialty technic minifigures would have made this set all the better. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
