Another supplementary set like the 8030, 8040, and 8050.  Not too sure what to say about this one – I think the 8035 was a Christmas present during my Lego Dark Ages. The wheels looked cool, but I never even opened the box, which turned out to be for the best – I put it up for sale on Ebay a while back and now someone else is enjoying it for a ton of money.  Sounds good to me.  6/10.  25 April 2004",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I also remember requesting Set 8700 cause it is shown on the instruction, so i could let it move. As a kid i loved this set because the instrucion gives you 5 Models (Cart, Windmill, Helicopter, Vent Fan and a Crane) to build from the parts (6 if you count the Cart + 8700). <br>Overall another a good childhood memory.<br>",TRUE,3,3,5,5,3
