All sorts of little contraptions can be conjured up with the almost perfect mix of parts here, including a gloriously pointless but great fun pneumatic powered steering set-up.. if you have a need for a quick fix of creativity but not a lot of time, grab one of these.<div><br></div><div>The only downside is to do with these first generation pneumatics with their single connection and complex switching arrangements which are tricky to package in a small model, but look on the bright side - their relative weakness is less of a problem here than with bigger models.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, a great introduction to the principles of pneumatics.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I am a big fan of these Universal sets for the multiple&nbsp;models that you can build from one set and the basic technics principles they taught me.</p>

<p>I got the most play time out of the dump truck, crane and forklift. The&nbsp;crane had a bit of a clamping force problem but it was enough to work with. The Fork lift lacked counter weight but you could simple hold it with your hands. The car that steered&nbsp;by the pneumatics was interesting but not really practical to play with i built it only once to see how it worked. The dump truck lacked a good bucket to hold things. For me that was easy to remedy&nbsp;with&nbsp;parts from 8020. I then went on to use parts form 8030 adn 8020 to make much larger versions of the dumper section.</p>

<p>As with the other universal sets the value is in the construction methods and principles you learned from the multiple modeles. Each universal set was good on its own and well worth the money nad time. when combined with the others they where fantastic to own and offered nearly endless posabilities.&nbsp;</p>

"READYdot","2017-04-16T20:16:37.32Z","Things sure have changed...","<p>I got this set second-hand, because I thought I&#39;d owned it as a kid. But building the models it got clearer that this wasn&#39;t one of the sets I owned as a kid. I was positively surprised by the moderate difficulty these models pose. Getting the tubing right is not as easy as it might seem. I have no prior experience with pneumatics as I&#39;m new to the AFOL&nbsp;hobby. :) What surprised me most is how Lego Technics still was more kind of LEGO-ish at that time or brickish... most pieces are not specialized but plain simple pieces. But this set is really fun.&nbsp;</p>
