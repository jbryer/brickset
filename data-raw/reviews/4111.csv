<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other parts are quite standard, not very exciting at all. Blue technic breaks were already known&nbsp;from sets 854 and 8844. So, the motor is the most important part of set 8050.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building instructions manual shows five models:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- a small cart with manual steering</p>
<p>- a helicopter</p>
<p>- a crane</p>
<p>These three are rather straightforward models, without big surprises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4th model is a walking robot. No complex design, it doesn't work perfect, but it is impressive. It shows&nbsp;the possibilities&nbsp;that&nbsp;were beyond cars, helicopters and cranes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 5th and last model is another car. The motor doesn't drive the rear wheels only, also the steering is connected to the motor. As a result, the car runs autonomously, a kind of ""zigzag"" mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From today's point of view, this set is nothing special. Today, most of the bigger technic model&nbsp;contain a power functions motor. During the 80ies and early 90ies, motors were available only as supplemental sets, or as part of an Universal set. 8050 was the first motorized set, followed by 8055, 8054, 8064 and 8082.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there's no reason to buy 8050 today. But for nostalgic reasons, it is great fun to build the robot or the autonomous car.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
