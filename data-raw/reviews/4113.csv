I liked this set very much. My favorite models in this set are the jeep and the crane. I didn't like the conveyor machine (the truck that pulls it is ok). The best part for me was the black spiral screw (it helped to lift things like crane arms, fire truck ladders, dumps (i hadn't pneumatics that time:( ) Although the models in the instructions weren't good i played many years with this set. I mixed with my other sets and i made lots of motorised trucks,helicopters vans. The old friend 4.5 motor still works.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T22:07:25Z","Great motor set!","This was my first motor-set and perhaps my second or third technic set. I do not know how old I was, but probably six. The models included in the box is small and not that interesting, however it is enough parts to make a lot of other cool things. On Christmas eve, when I got it, I used it, among others, to build my first designed-by-me electric car, albeit a very simple one. Using this kit, a lot of other models can get equipped with non-human power, which is a lot of fun! However, as others have noted, the 4.5 v engine is not that impressive in contrast to the more modern 9v engine, so today other packages are probably recommended. But at the time this was super cool! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
