"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-06T10:23:29.123Z","A Solid Set","I received this set as a Christmas gift one year, over a decade ago.  I was immediately very fond of the set due to the inclusion of the briefcase.  I loved that I was able to sort the pieces into the separate compartments.  This not only satisfied my desire for everything to be organized, ti greatly simplified the building process.  No more frustrated searches for small pieces among the wild spread.  Everything was right where I had decided to categorize it. 

Unfortunately, some of the models which had included instructions were slightly lackluster.  The helicopter was relatively plain compared to some other Technic helicopters I have seen, and the truck/motorcycle combo was also a bit bland.  The saving grace of this set was the 6-wheeled lift vehicle.  I absolutely LOVED this particular model.  This was one of those models that I could build again and again and never tire of.  I would disassemble this model, only to go back and build the exact same model over!  It felt like a very solidly built model.

On the whole, despite the shortcomings of some of the models, I think this was a very solid set.  It had a lot of pieces and allowed for a lot of creativity.  Once again, I am saddened to know that this set is somewhere in the depths of my parent's basement.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
