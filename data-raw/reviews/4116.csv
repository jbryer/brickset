Pretty good designs, except for the helicopter which looked kinda goofy.

Lots of gears

Relatively uncommon red color

The motor setup works for most motor options with technic sets, so you dont have to get the power pack.


The bad:

Really difficult for beginners. This was my FIRST technic set, actually any set of difficulty and it blew my mind in the first few steps.

Kinda useless without batteries. And battery-less play is the beauty of lego

Rubber bands were meant to break.


THE UGLY

veeeerrry expensive. if i remember right, close to 90 bucks!


Conclusion:

The contemorary (blue)pneumatic universal set was far cooler and more interesting mechanically.

And a lot cheaper.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T14:06:12Z","Good Motor Pack","I bought this set back in 1998, when I found it in an small Italian toy store. It wasn't that expensive converted to Euros: Only around 41â‚¬ back then. The set has Instructions for 4 Models, that I'm describing now:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Sportscar: 
This car has a very clunky design. Heck! It's really like sportscars of the 70s to 80s but very small compared to the bigger Technic Supercars. This car has the motor in the rear, but after the years I've got problems with the motor. It stops even tough the batteries are full. The car is steerable, but that's very difficult to manage.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Helicopter:
This is a weird model. It has the motor controls on board and not a small detail in the front. But this doesn't matter. The motor is powering the rotors only.
-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Tow Truck:
This model is a small model of the tow truck, which looks a bit like the Rebel Wrecker from 1994 but much smaller. The model has the motor in about the middle of it. This time the motor is powering the towing mechanism. It doesn't drive with the motor so you have to push it yourself. The other function is the steering.
-----------------------------------------------------------
4. Forklift/Crane?:
The model is a weird forklift-like thing with the motor in back. It powers the mechanism with the fork? and the crane arm. You must push it to make it driving, but it's steerable, too.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Overall: A good universal set with a motor and classic Model Team wheels.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Aqualize","2010-01-07T06:40:27.123Z","Good use of the electric engine in some models","This is a very good example of the electric motor well integrated in the design of the models, not often like the supplementary instructions for other sets where electric motor was more of less just add to the outside of it.

I don't know if it contains all the parts as the extra electric set does (some of those are needed to add a motor to other sets) but I guess you use the motor from this to other sets.

The car is very basic and the steering wheel is hard to control. I much more like modern technic with ""power functions"" addition when it comes to cars where the motor drives the wheel because it also can control the steering.

The helicopter is supposed to look like a cargo helicopter have two rotors (the main and the stabilizer). Kids that like running around with airplanes as they where actually flying would probably like this as the rotor spins.

The two last models is the ones I like the most because they have the motor integrated in the design and it is used for other things than driving the wheels.

Personally I like the telehandler the most, having the motor with all those gears converting rotary movement to linear movement of the arm.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
