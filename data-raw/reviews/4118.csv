<p>In 1991,&nbsp;a new Lego technology called&nbsp;""Flex System"" has been released. Not a huge thing, compared to the introduction of the Control-Center / 9V system one year ago. But a great option, to create mechanisms beyond axles, gears and bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new flex system has been introduced both within a model set (8856) and a universal set, so here we are: 8074.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p>We get a total of 300+ parts, of course the flex system parts are the most interesting ones. But also the turntable and the balloon tires were rather new, both were released only one year ago.</p>
<p>All other parts are quite standard, there are lots of black, gray and yellow elements. Instead of yellow, I would have preferred another color, maybe blue or white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Models:</strong></p>
<p>The building intructions show the steps to build 4 very different models:</p>
<p>- forklift truck</p>
<p>- crane</p>
<p>- simple log loader</p>
<p>- grader</p>
<p>All models are focussed on technical features, prior to the looks. All in all, the models show the different uses cases of the flex system:</p>
<p>- move things straightforward</p>
<p>-&nbsp;move things ""around the corner""</p>
<p>- optical ornament and/or additional strut sections</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building experience:</strong></p>
<p>Like every new technology, building the models was a great - back in 1991. Learning by doing, how to use the new possibilities.</p>
<p>Today, the flex system is nothing new at all. But if you've never used the flex system before, building on of these models might be a good start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playabality:</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, all models offer 2 or 3 working features. Therefore, the set offers great playability in general.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3
