Obviously this set is not confusing to constrct whatsoever, and contains very basic Lego pieces.
If you have these pieces, you could simply construct it too, without having to purchase it.
The only unique piece this set contains, is the 1x2 yellow brick with three circles printed on one side to make a face.
This Santa is 3 studs long, 4 studs wide, and about 8 studs tall.

Once built, the figure seems quite boring.
At certain angles, you could not even tell what the figure is suposed to be.
The pieces that tend to fall off are his feet and point on his cap. You cannot apply presure at these points or they will buckle, which makes it akward to attach/detach the figure to other Lego studs.

Unfortunatly for some, this set can only be found if you are in the right place at the right time.
I happened to be in New Zealand in the 80's when I came across this set.

I find this set to be an average product from Lego.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Altough the set is rare, it is very basic and easy to build, being also easy make this with other pieces. The playability isn't good, of course, it is a small sculpture made with basic pieces, such as a 2X2 red brick and 2X2 black plate. An interesting piece is the 2X1 yellow brick with three printed circles, one red and two black, as eyes. The piece is useful to make things like this (a little &quot;sculpture&quot;), I think. Because it don't shows much compatibility with some other types of creations. 

There isn't much to asy about the building, it is easy to buildi and to know how build it. The color scheme is very good, and the pieces are also useful. But it have some few problems with building. It could be a bit more complex, for example, it could have other pieces to make the beard, because in this set, the beard is located below the &quot;mouth&quot;. And it is a bit wrong.

I recommend to use the pieces of this set to increase other sets, because it is too simple, and the building isn't very good. But as a set from the Basic theme, it is good. 

I don't know about the ebay, but by bricklink this set is very cheap, it is around $1 to $4. So, if you want to have another type of stuff to your city, I think it can be a good choice. This set is a 3,6, basic but really useful (not very good in building, and of course, it don't shows great playability) and cheap.

I always recall as a child building it each year to display during the holidays.  

This is about as basic as it gets in terms of buidling, but its always fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I don't understand the limited release message as ours were purchased on Canada. I found the pieces for all of them in our lego collection and put 2 in my kids stockings this past Christmas. We used to always make them part of our winter scene and I hope to encourage my kids to do the same. </p>
<p>Santa is a very easy but effective build and I am glad to have him in my collection.</p>
