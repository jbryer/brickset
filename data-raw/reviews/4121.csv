each 1 left and right glass door like in 6373
1 right glass oor with bars like from 6374
2 right wooden doors like from 6364
2 large windows 1x4x5 also like from 6373
2 Windows 1x4x3 with flipping glass inlays also like from 6373
4 Windows 1x4x3 like from 535 but with green shutters
I think about 4 or 5 classic 1x2x2 windows with red frame like from 351

This prove to be an always useful combination of doors and windows",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
