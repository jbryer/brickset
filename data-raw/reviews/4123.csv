It was the most expensive model at the time, and it was on top on my wish list, and I was so happy when I got it. :) The most interesting part, at the time, was all the buttons and lamps and stuff :) The possibility to program the motors to do a task, and then let them do it was a lot of fun (instead of always manually control things). I built the drawing-machine (primary) on the manual-page 2 times and the other models a few times. The primary model was not the most interesting in the package IMO, I believe there were 2 or 3 other models (robot, industry robot, and maybe something else). Buy it if you find a cheap one used package - otherwise it is mindstorms that is the thing today! :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T20:46:35Z","Great set, great memories ( my last technic set )","I got this set at age 13 or 14. As mentioned in another review, this was the most expensive set released that year. I still remember it's price 1500( norwegian kroner ) which equals around 237$. I was very excited when opening the box, but it really didn't contain that many parts. You had the control center, a couple of electric motors and the building blocks. I build all the models. I remember the plotter, then I think there was a robot for moving lego parts around and maybe a crane. Everything worked nicely, although I don't think the plotter worked that well. On a sidenote, I actually got the set to persuade me to turn in a soft airgun I bought. I bought it without her knowledge and it scared the heck out of her ;) ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

You can do alot of things with this like making it draw or write. The control panel is nice for its time period. This is an example of a fun Techinc set. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DrFrankenstein","2015-03-23T03:24:24.863Z","Pioneer in programmable LEGO sets","<p>8094 is a unique set amongst the Technic. It was the first programmable Technic set released almost a decade ahead of the first Mindstroms set. Modeled after Dacta (LEGO Education) sets 1090 and 1092 it featured improved models and the new 9V electric system. The programmable control center allows powering up to 3 motors (9V) on independent channels. It is capable of recording a control sequence an then replaying it in real time, skipping the time gaps, and in loops. While it lacks the ability to respond to sensors first introduced in the Barcode Multi-Set (8479), it still makes basic automation possible in the set&#39;s models. Not only this, but 8094 is the first Technic set to feature multiple motors (two, to be precise). And if this innovation is not sufficient, the set offers no less than four outstanding models that are unique in Technic. They all demonstrate how a range of functions can be achieved with a relatively small number of parts. [Note: Technically speaking, the capabilities in 8094 and more were available already through Dacta. However, Dacta was only available through education channels and very hard to find.]</p>

<p>The robotic arm is my personal favorite model in the set. It resembles closely a real robotic arm used in assembly lines. The model includes a parts sorting playground that allows to demonstrate the robot&#39;s ability to do useful work. The best part in this model is the clever multiplexing of two key functions powered a single motor without the need for a clutch mechanism. The motor in the back of the arm (which also serves a form of counter-weight) opens and closes the arm&#39;s grippers as well as swings the arm up in the air. It is worth studying up close to understand how this is achieved.</p>

<p>My second favorite model is the graph plotter. While it it is more limited than the arm or the mobile crane in terms of variety of functions, it is very different from the usual Technic models subject matter. It woks just like a real graph plotter allowing continuous-line 2D drawing with the pen included in the set. While the precision of the arm is not perfect, it&#39;s sufficient for drawing some interesting shapes and compositions.</p>

<p>The mobile crane is also an outstanding model that is worth being a set&#39;s leading model by itself. It has no less than four functions packed in - manual outriggers, electric turntable, and an articulated liftarm with two complimentary motion articulation cycles. The two liftarm functions are multiplexed via a clever automatic clutch mechanism that routes a single motor&#39;s power to two separate mechanisms depending on the rotational direction. The mobile crane comes with a platform that can be moved around the perimeter of the machine.</p>

<p>The final model is a sort of mobile drawer robot on two wheels. It is somewhat interesting, but fairly limited in what it can do. Perhaps the designers included it to demonstrate the ability to control two wheels independently with two motors to achieve in-place turns.</p>

<p>The Control Center is a remarkable set that paved the way for Mindstorms back in 1990. It combines a powerful electric system with interesting models that are lots of fun to build and operate. 8094 is a beautiful example of the wonderfully innovative and increasingly more complex Technic sets of the early 90s and easily one of the best Technic flagships of all times. Frankly, I think this set is underrated these days even though it has tons of coolness packed in. Pick one up if you get a chance - you won&#39;t regret it.</p>
