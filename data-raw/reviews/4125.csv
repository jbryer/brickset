"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-20T09:23:08Z","A true Universal Motor","I love this set! It contains a powerful motor wich can pull trains, trucks, cars and more! You can even use it in your technic models! I specially like the the two treads(I goy two extra too). I'm happy I bought this set for only 125 NOK(less than 18$). It runs good but it drains your batteries fast. I also had some problems with the original wire, poor contact, the motor stopped an I had to touch the wire to start the motor again. But I've also solved the porblem, I just switched the wire with a new one(with the original plugs). This engine can easily pull atleast two 6x28 wagons as a locomotive at the same size. I hvaen't tested it with more wagons yet, but I'll tell you when I have(and how many wagons it pulled).

But anyway this set is a true Universal Motor! It can almoast do anything you want, but it's heavy. It contains 29 parts(if you count the wire as a single part)

"Novelty","2007-08-25T23:45:55.253Z","Run Baby Run","The motor is the single most important piece in this set as it forms the heart of most motorised sets.  The neat thing is that it can also be used to power the trains and actually comes with the wheels for the 4.5V trains as well.  The only bad thing about it is the clunky battery box which is grey in colour and needs to be incorporated into the object built - this can be a problem particular when the model is mobile (e.g. train) and extra care has to be taken that the battery box does not look out of place.  The only plus of the battery box can also be used to power the lighting bricks as well.  Besides the train wheels, there are 3 other sets of wheels as well, including a pair of tank threads in the set.  These will allow almost any vehicle imaginable to be built around the motor.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
