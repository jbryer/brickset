"Novelty","2007-04-14T00:46:55.177Z","Light up","A large variety of transparent coloured bricks, 2 lights and some cables comes in this set.  The downside is that there's no battery box so it doesn't work on its own.  Combine this with a battery box (say the one from 810) and it can be nifty for lighting up houses and space stations and all sorts of creations.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
