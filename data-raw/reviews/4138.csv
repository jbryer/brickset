The best microtechnic I have. Both model have excellent play value (ask my son!) and are nice to display also.
Has a few spare parts too. Propellor rotates with wheels.
The alternate model is a helicopter, also with rotor connected to the wheels.
I bought two to have one of each model on display.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
