We rented a RV and stopped by at a K-Mart. I was bought this set and I played with it the entire 4 hour journey to Salt Lake City. I liked pulling back this car and it will go along the table and fall nose-first into the built-in cupholder. Great playability. This was my first Technic set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
