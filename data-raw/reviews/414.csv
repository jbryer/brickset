As for the model: while it does its job, it's probably best used as a source for pieces for other creations.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"istiboule","2009-05-01T10:56:58.467Z","My first set...","This set is simply my best one, not by its size, or its parts, just cause it's my first set, received in 1986. The beginning of an awsome collection...
This set is also a great one cause i think more a set is simple, more a set is fun.
This is lego power : Be able to develop big models, with thousand of parts, and on the other side, build smaller sets, with only one minifig, but very efficient.
I put a ""5"" for all these reasons.
Long life to lego space !",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is also a good idea to build an army off of this set. This set is good but not the best.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
