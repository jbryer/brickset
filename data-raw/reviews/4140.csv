It has a little shock in the back for suspension, like most other technic sets, the wheel turns. It doesn't come with a little Technic fig. I give it a 7/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I looks cool! It's sturdy and fun to play with! At the time, I paid $4.85 for mine, but now I would pay $10.00 FOR IT!

"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-06T10:28:30.373Z","Awesome and Fun","As this set came out in 1996, I would have been 13 years old when I received it.  Thus, my skill with Technic would have been considered 'above' this little set.  But, that doesn't change the fact that I really loved this little set.  It was a very quick and simple build, but the end product was just fun.  I found this little set to be very endearing, especially because it had 2 working 'features' (the suspension and the steerings), which was a great attribute for such a small set.  Also, it came with a figure, and those guys provided me with hours of action figure adventure!

This little set was pretty solid, all things considered, and it was a very simple assembly/disassembly.  I really got a lot of mileage out of this little set, getting more out of it than I got out of many of my larger and much more expensive sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-16T10:23:53.573Z","LEGO Technic - Dune Duster Review","<p>This is not my favourite LEGO Technic set but it's still a good set to get for pieces. This is an easy built and you also get a few stickers which you need to put on. We also get an instruction for a second model you can build with the pieces of this set. There're not many play features in this set but it's still worth the money. We get a steering weel which makes the tyres in the front moving to the right and to the left and a cool spring mechanism on the tyres on the back. I also like the choice of the colors of this vehicle. This model does have a good look but it doesn't have many play features. It's a good set to start your LEGO Technic collection with as well.</p><p><br></p><p>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

The pieces in this set that are completely amazing are the wheels, steering wheel, rack n pinion steering, the suspension in the back and the seat.  The stickers actually work really well in this set and I am no fan of stickers.  So that says a lot.  The tube piece is unique and adds an extra bit of flair to the finished product.
