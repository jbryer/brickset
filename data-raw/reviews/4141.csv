Well I like it and the nicest Fact is, that there are only 55pcs in this beautyful bike. Well and it was studless, 5 years before the new studless Technic range was released. So I found it really unique back in 1998, when I bought this little set. Too bad, that there aren't instructions for an alternate model.
Otherwise a good set, that deserves a 7,5/10 rounded up to 8/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
