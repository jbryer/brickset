"Monty","2007-03-15T08:51:19.607Z","Does what it says on the tin.","As people seem to have reviewed this I thought why not add my views. This is a very useful tool for separating bricks that are stuck fast - sometimes having two - one on each part is necessary. It strikes me it would have been very useful to have when I was younger as much of my surviving childhood Lego bears many teeth marks which is how I recall we used to separate bricks in the old days - especially when the tiles did not have a little groove around the bottom – not that this would help you there as it needs studs or holes to lock into. Anyway, it does what is says it does – separates bricks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-05-15T10:53:09.483Z","Decent Brick","This set is just a brick, I got this with my first Lego set (4152), a bucket with a lot of different bricks, released in 1995. This brick, of course serves to separate other bricks and plates, and it works very well in some bricks but sometimes it don't separate so easy. Altough this looks like to be unuseful, this brick don't have problems, and sometimes separate hard pieces, it is sometimes neccessary (If you don't want separate hard pieces with your teeth). But, altough it can do somethings more easily, it isn't motive to pay much for it. If you find it with another set, in a bucket with lot of pieces, it will be a good addition. And if you don't find it in any set, pay for it, it can be found in some Legolands, but don't pay more than 2,5 dollars, it is just a brick. Overall, it can separate some hard pieces, and makes it easily, sometimes. So, in comparison with other bricks, it gets a 4,8/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Takes apart your Lego bricks, not Technic pieces
Not exacly sure of the price, but I know they're really cheap
Saves Time and effort
It's only one piece, so don't worry about it falling apart

There isn't much to say about this other than that. If you don't have one, I'd highly recommend getting one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2008-08-30T16:27:51.59Z","Invaluable LEGO Tool!","I got this tool in a Creator Dino set. I love it and when I am MOC'ing I always have it by my side on the table. It is the perfect tool for separating those tough to pull apart plates. You just apply a tiny bit of pressure and the tool separates plates with the greatest of ease. As a kid I would place the LEGO plates in between my teeth and try to separate them! If this was around when I built with LEGO as a kid my childhood LEGO would not have teeth marks on them!

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-02-08T20:19:12.343Z","Pretty useful","I didn't actually get this on its own, but it came with set 4153. It's nice to have something to pull apart plates, however, sometimes 2 plates that stick together hard can be painstaking to separate, even with this simple machine. The idea is to slowly pry them apart, because when being separated, the bottom plate's studs can drill into the top plate's underside where it clutches. As a result, the dented plate's clutch power can be weakened, and in extreme cases, stress the plate enough so that it cracks. Overall, useful tool, but use carefully to ensure the highest possible warranty of bricks and plates.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thenaterater","2008-08-11T17:48:44.047Z","works pretty well","this works to separate bricks. it works the very best if you have a brick stuck on to a baseplate, sometimes it will not work if you have two smaller bricks stuck together, but it usually works, and as a kid, it reminded me of a vaccum ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Now I can seperate any basic bricks apart. You put your thumb on the hole near the studs and hold it round the lines at the back. then you put the holes underneath the studs on the brick you want to separate. then push your hand down and the bricks separate.

pros:
very useful for separating basic bricks

cons:
hard to get

"MetroiD","2009-01-11T18:34:47.123Z","This chunk of classic grey used to be vital - until the emergence of neon orange","<p>When I first saw this tool, its functionality was completely lost on me and I ended up using it as a chunky, oversized antenna - imagine the size of TV set I had come up with. I took me some time to grasp how the Separator separates, but once I realized just how great it can be with plates, it was always by my side: remember, the clutch power of last-century LEGO could at times transcend the laws of physics... In terms of ergonomics, the &quot;classic&quot; separator has a very nice, chunky feel to it and my thumb always enjoyed having that rounded indent as its designated spot.</p>

<p>However, the Separator was not particularly useful when dealing with tiles - yes, it did have a slight edge at the front which was supposed to help with those but working with that was a hit or a miss kind of experience. Furthermore, its scope of operation was always limited to just &quot;System&quot; - i.e. forget about Technic. Which is why, especially in light of the emergence of &quot;modern&quot; orange / green separators, this one realistically needs to be docked one point.</p>

<p>Having noted the above though, while underlining that the current orange separator is more functional and has a wider range of applications, I must still note that this big ol&#39; chunk of grey feels decidedly more comfortable in my hand. It might just be the nostalgia, but it&#39;s well and truly a symbol of &quot;Classic System&quot; - and you can&#39;t beat that.</p>

Just pull out the Brick Separator, and those troublesome one-byes will be apart in three seconds. Well, if you do it right. For some bricks, you just pull and they come apart. But with many plates, there's a trick. You have to build around the bottom plate until only the top one can be seen.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;you can pull the top one off.

"J14T14","2018-03-09T16:50:13.76Z","Was Great, But Doesn't Hold Up Today","<p>This set was probably a great thing to get in 1990 since piece removers weren&#39;t as common back then as they are today. A tool that could remove bricks and plates from each other was really nice then and it still is today, but this set doesn&#39;t hold up.</p>

<p>The picture on the packaging can make some people think that this comes with some extra pieces to make the little figure, but this is not true. The set only comes with one piece remover, so this is a little deceiving.</p>

<p>The reason why this set doesn&#39;t hold up today is because of the newer piece remover design. The new piece remover comes in every set that is over $50 while the old one came out in a select few sets such as this one.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this set is only nice to get today if you want something to remind you of LEGO&#39;s history.</p>
