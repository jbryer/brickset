It contains a few system pieces, and a few nice technic ones too. The wheels are nice, and suit the set. The suspension looks great, and works well although it is a bit stiff.
The build is very simple and only takes 10 minutes to make it. 

This model has two functions. The working suspension, and the steering. Both work as they should, and do not let this model down.

Visually, this bike looks great with its red and black theme and grey engine. There isn't too many details, but that is to be expected in a set of this size.

Pros:
Suspension
Colour scheme
Wheels

Cons: 
Lack of details
Odd looking engine
