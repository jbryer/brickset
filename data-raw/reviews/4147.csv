I got this set back then in my country for slightly less money than the Kraken Attack (of Pirates 2009) costs today. Being a little technic set, it incorporates a steering mechanism and the second build can be combined with the 9V motor set to propel it. Ok, the second model is weird in that it is designed around the motor and the motor with the wired controller itself is an archaic piece of design. But I guess the miniature technics today have become Creators and that is where this set is a gem. Unlike set 6743 (Street Speeder), which is more expensive even if inflation is accounted for, it comes with technic pieces, looks like a proper scaled down F1 car (just check out that rear wing!) and is solid once built. Only the steering is a bit large but other wise its good set. Of course the side pods and driver pod is 'shaped' by those blue tubes but the illusion works. However there was just one peculiarity with this set, Im aware of Legos' great quality and design, but somehow, in this set one of the tubes for the side pod supplied was actually a tad too short so it pops easily but i suspect its only that way in my set. But it just adds further character and i absolutely love this car.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

When I first built it I really had lot's of problems to build this set. I few years ago I found it back and built it without problems. You also get a few stickers to put on and I really like the design of this set. The only piece which is printed is the piece which has the red number 1 on it. This car is very nice to play with and to maneuver as well. It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
