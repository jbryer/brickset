"zniesmaczony","2022-01-09T23:13:55.007Z","A nice, simple build with working engine.","<p>This is a small scale trike, identical in size to 8236 Bike Burner. It has, however, an interesting detail, unlike the 8236: a one-cylinder engine with moving piston. The build is very simple, quite enjoyable. Great for beginner builders and children starting their adventure with the bricks.</p>
