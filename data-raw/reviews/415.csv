Anyway, on to the model itself: it's a nice little wheeled jobbie that serves as a good introduction to the jet-pack age of the early space models.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The highlight is the two minifigs that come with jetpacks.  But otherwise this is just a non-descript ground vehicle that gets a couple guys from point A to point B.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"folkform","2011-11-15T20:52:58.637Z","Nice minifigs, nice little vehicle","The coolest parts of this set are the rocket packs for the minifigs.&nbsp; It is rare for sets of this era to have multiple parts making backpacks.&nbsp; Plus there are extra air tanks if you prefer the ""classic"" look.&nbsp; It is taller than other small vehicles and I like to think of it more as a repair/service vehicle rather than a ""Command Trailer"".<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3
