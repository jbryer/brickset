It's a great build and it's very easy to maneuver this vehicle. I love the way how LEGO did the engine with the yellow piston which moves up and down if you move the tyres on the back. If you turn the steering wheel on the front the tyres on the front will sviwel as well. It's a fun set to have and you're also able to build a second model with the pieces you get. But you have to take the go-kart apart first. If you want you can also add a motor set to the go-kart. This set is very sturdy and worth the money.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
