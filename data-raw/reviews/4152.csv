Quite a simple design, and not a huge number of pieces - but still a good pickup (I don't think it was too expensive).

Mechanism for rotation works quite well, and all-in-all, this is a nifty little set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"samuraiturtle","2009-11-04T03:49:30.5Z","Not Much Function To It","As the title states I think their is not much function for it.  I am not sure it is because it is a smaller technic set or what it might be.  The prime function is moving of the wings (if you could call them that).  And it uses a turn screw which makes it slow and in turn not too fun.  I think they should of hooked the propelers up to spin in unison, that would of help the set.  A plus is that is does come with a Technic Figure.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
