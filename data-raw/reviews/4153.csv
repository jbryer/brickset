"sabpol","2007-11-17T19:58:02.89Z","A lot in a little set","For a Technic set with only 126 pieces, this has quite a lot of building potential.  The instructions show you how to build both a hydrofoil and a helicopter, each with room for the Bigfig to sit. The instructions also show how to outfit the unit with a motor (not included) to bring your vehicle to life.

There are gears of 4 different sizes and shapes, plus 2 wheels with smooth rubber tires and a steering wheel.  

The Bigfig/Technicfig is a bit awkward-looking.  These did not seem to catch on the way the minifigs have.  But for the technical aspects, this is a nice set to have if you don't have a lot of time to build but want to create something functional.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
