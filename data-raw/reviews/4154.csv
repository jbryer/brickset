This was one of my first forays into the world of Lego Technic. It was fun to put together, and I absolutely loved the (not-so-mini)figure that was included. If you can find this set today, don't hesitate to pick it up. It was alot of fun then, and is still fun today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It came with two working functions, steering and piston engine, which as always is a delight in a small set.  It also included a figure which provided me with hours of fun outside of the set.

Perhaps what I like best about this set is the little added bits that show some attention to detail.  I love the side bars and the front push bar.  These easily could have been left out, but their inclusion shows they went a little bit further with this little set.

It was a quick and easy build/disassembly and a very enjoyable little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
