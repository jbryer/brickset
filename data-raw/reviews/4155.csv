"AddictedToStyrene","2007-09-26T08:31:23.467Z","Good but simple","A nice little Technic buggy. It makes a simple vehicle, not too small, and pretty strong when you zoom it around.
The front wheels don't steer, but instead they tilt when you move the vehicle's body in the direction you want to go. It works, but it is unusual. I liked it anyway. 
The driver's seat is a single piece moulding. The wheels are also a good size for mini-fig scale monster trucks or moon vehicles.

set (8226) is a LEGO Technic set which came out in 1998. It doesn't
include any minifigures but there are some stickers in this set. This
set has 127 pieces and builds 2 different models. It also comes with an
instruction which shows you how to add the motor set (8735). All
instructions have no mistakes and the set has no missing pieces. The
first model took me about 10 minutes to put together.<br>

<ul><li>A little bit too simple. Some people will like the bigger ones.</li><li>This set has some stickers</li><li>Not so many play features</li></ul>

All in all it's a good set and I would recommend you to get it. The
only places to find this model are eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Duq","2011-01-08T13:59:26.627Z","An interesting little set","<p>This little dune buggy is a one of a kind as far as I know. It has four-wheel steering but instead of a Hand of God control on its roof it steers by pushing one side of the car down. This makes it very easy for children to play and pretty rugged.</p><p>For anyone with Technic experience it may not be the most challenging build but it's enjoyable anyway because of the original concept.</p><p>No parts you haven't seen in other sets here but this is one of only two sets that have the old steering arm (<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=32068"">32068</a>) in red and also one of only two sets that have the small balloon tires with <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=6580"">red hubs</a>.</p><p>You can get this set used for about â‚¬6,- on Bricklink at the moment and for that price it's definitely a fun little set to own.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"BENGEE2131","2013-04-16T13:17:11.73Z","A surprisingly good little set...","<p>I brought this set not realising I already had it in a big bundle of LEGO Technic parts, despite this I was pleasantly surprised. The model is rugged and simple but good</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Clever steering system,</li><li>Good for scale collectors,</li><li>Nice tires,</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It uses elastic bands, which inevitably perishes,</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Overall this a good model, perhaps a good starter model for anyone wishing to start with LEGO Technic.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
