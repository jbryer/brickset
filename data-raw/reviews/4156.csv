"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-12T17:49:59.717Z","Good Lego Technic Set","I like this set quite a lot. It has some nice Lego Technic parts(like threads) to it as well as cool minifigure (which Lego does not make anymore for some reason). This set has a good playability, since the main model can seperate into two parts: bottom part with threads that acts as some kind of tractor and top part that can act as some kind of flyer. This model can also be rebuilt into a forklift that can be motorized. Unfortunatly, forklift does not move very well when motorized. This set is a great addition to any Technic collection. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I&#39;m the kind of person who loves things that do something - transform, detach, move, shoot, etc.&nbsp;And this set did something cool! The top &quot;flying craft&quot; can detach form the bottom &quot;track vehicle&quot; via a little locking mechanism - it works very well!</p>

<p><br />
It&#39;s solid, so it will never fall apart by itself - yet easy to detach via the mechanism.&nbsp;Also, the cockpit opens via a cog mechanism, pretty good too.</p>

I was very happy with this set, especially given it was reasonably priced! :)</p>
