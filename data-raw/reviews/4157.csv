While it's only real function was steering, I liked how it was operated from the top of the vehicle (this is the first set I remember getting to feature steering of this nature, rather than having the gearing attached directly to the steering wheel).  I also loved that it came with the police officer figure, which I do not remember seeing elsewhere.  Combining this with several of my other little racecar sets that came with figures led to some truly spectacular movie-quality chase scenes!  I also liked the use of tubing the form the 'A-pillar' of this little car.  Again, this was the first time I remember seeing this in a set and I liked the change of pace.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
