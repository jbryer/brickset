"NightCabbage","2008-09-05T01:15:52.327Z","Good for its size","Given this model isn't very big, and doesn't have many pieces, I was actually surprised by its functionality.

It has a rotating handle at the back, which controls the lift of the &quot;bucket&quot; arms (bucket being the official term for the shovel/digger thing).

And there is a little &quot;switch&quot; on the top of the arm (beside the cockpit) that can make the bucket load/unload (rotates the bucket).

Nothing spectacular, but still, for its size, I thought it was pretty neat.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"tripeman","2015-04-14T08:46:23.917Z","Not as good as its predecessor","<p>I won this set in a Lego Freestyle competition back in 1996 and I must say that I never quite got to liking it very much. I already had the previous one - <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8828-1/Front-End-Loader""><span>8828: </span> Front End Loader</a> which came just three years earlier and I found it better in every way - the build, the looks, the overall feel, even the secondary model. I especially didn&#39;t like the two single-piece gearboxes which just seemed to be unnecessarily simplifying the steering and bucket arm raising/lowering mechanisms. The 8228 had everything assembled from smaller pieces and it was much more fun to build. Probably the only good thing about this update is the Technic figure but even that one has a questionable expression on him.</p>
