It doesn't have a whole lot of pieces, but the instruction booklet allows you to build 3 different models.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-30T08:38:50.373Z","LEGO Technic (Speed Slammers) - Bike Burner Review","As many LEGO Technic sets this set doesn't have many play features. It's a great built and it's very sturdy. It's also very easy to maneuver this vehicle because the steering wheel does sviwel. And this is also the only play feature of this set. This model is very good if you want to start building your first LEGO Technic sets. We also get a few stickers in this set which you need to put on. It's a good model to have and I can't complain about it.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
