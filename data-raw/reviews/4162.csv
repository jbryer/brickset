We get a ramp, a car and a slammer which you can push to launch this vehicle. It's a nice and easy build and we also get a few stickers to worry about. The car has a great design and you can maneuver it very easily. It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<div>Overall just another average set, from an average Technic theme. The parts are common.</div>",TRUE,3,3,5,5,3
