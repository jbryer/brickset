"Blade","2008-01-01T21:54:18.153Z","Not as Fun as it Looks","Yay! First one to review this set and no surprises why. This set is part of the speed slammers set which never really took off and was scraped after 18 months.

This set was designed to be very universal. The battle cars are what the sound like, a Technic frame in the shape of a car with an arm controlled by a knob at the back. Aim: use your cars arm to hit the other cars front plate before he hits yours. When the plate is hit the cockpit goes flying off and you win.

The cars can be slightly modified so you hit a bar the front to launch the cockpit at the opponent’s car as a attack.

The other option is they can be completely modified to become a sort of goalkeeper with a goal and they can slam the wheels at each other trying to score.

Overall there really isn’t much more to be said about this set you really need to judge it for yourself. I feel this set is just scrapping a 5/10 only due to its playability and choice of model. I found no matter which way you build it; it becomes boring, very quickly. I would only recommend it to a true Technic fan or someone who is looking for something really different for their collection.

Building it was easy, but playing it was hard. You got to spin the wheel at the back of the car so that the hand could move up and down and your goal is to try to hit the target of the other car. It is not fun at all.

Thus, i rate it 1/5.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

For years, every time I saw it in a catalog or in other ads that come with LEGO sets, I kept thinking to myself it looks awful -- boring and ugly design and colors, uninspired function. I simply never understood why this set had to be made. The main models only have one gimmick, namely by turning a gear on the back of the cars, you operate their long arm to hit the target on your opponent. And that's it. The whole set was designed around this basic idea. I still don't get the point... surely there were other sets that could do the same, all the while looking better than these hunks of plastic.<br><p>The cars barely look the part. They have four wheels to roll on, but other than that, they are bare skeletons, made up entirely of beams and other thin elements. The only thing that looks like it has some integrity is the cockpit, which you are supposed to knock out of the other car during the game (or fire your own at it). Their colors don't really add much to the overall feel. Dull red and green, mixed with black. It screams<span style=""font-style: italic;""> boring</span>.</p><p>On the other hand, there are a couple of nice parts. If you're a Technic MOCist, you'd surely welcome all the beams and connectors the set has to offer. It also has a lot of wheels and tires. Not a huge variety of parts, but it's still the best thing I can say about the set. I haven't bothered to test the alternate models, since they look just as uninteresting as the main ones. Rather, I tried to build what MOCs I could with the supplied pieces. As I've said, the models are good as part packs.</p><p>They come with stickers, which I know a lot of LEGO fans hate. But hey,at least these add a bit more color to the cars.<br></p><p>Of course, I'm not saying they are unplayable, horrible toys. If you have the time, the models could give you a few minutes of fun, but I'm sure the game wouldn't last long, since it is incredibly easy to hit the other player.</p><p>I would do a ""pros and cons"" list, but at this point, I don't feel it's needed. The bad aspects far outweigh the good. Which is a shame. The set could have been so much more. Instead, it's basically a gear-mechanism with a frame built around it. This feature alone doesn't make any model good, nor do I think should it merit a whole 2-model set.</p><p>Thus my verdict is: if you are in need of red and green pieces and a nice collection of rubber tires, have a go and buy it. Otherwise, stay away from the set.</p><p><br></p><p>In case you're wondering why I bought it, well, I wanted to obtain another set from an auction, but the seller only offered them together. I wasn't too fond of the decision, even considering the generous price. As of this writing, the set is in pieces, and both me and my brother are hard pressed to find a use for them.<br></p>",TRUE,2,4,2,3,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-19T10:21:10.847Z","LEGO Technic (Speed Slammers) - Battle Cars Review","This set is a fun set of the LEGO Technic theme to have. I like the way how the cockpit can be launched if you hit the plate of one of these two cars with an arm which has a tyre. The arm can be moved up and down if you turn the tyre on the back. Then the lever will shoot the cockpit away. There're two cars included in this set: we get a green car and a red car. This set also has a few stickers which you have to put on. It's a fun set to build and to play with for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
