It is basicly a red race car (and I think a cool looking one at that).  It does have room to fit a technic figure in the race car but, sadly one does not come with it.  And it does have cool stearing wheel if you like the one from Knight Rider a plus in my book.  Like most technic set it does have alternative models.  The other maine one is (I am guessing here) a selker race car.  The other two just showes how to turn the main model into a pull-back motor car and how to add some sort of digital reader (I guessing it is for speed).  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<ul><li>Simple build</li><li>Very smooth ride</li><li>sleek</li><li>fits the standard technic figure</li><li>near endless fun</li></ul>

<ul><li>well... &nbsp;the model itself is simplistic</li><li>the sticker on the ""hood"" didn't stick well...</li><li>B model was rather ugly IMO</li><li><br></li></ul>

"DrFrankenstein","2013-04-30T23:17:39.163Z","Nice looking car, useless set","<p>This is probably the best-looking set in the speed slammer series. As far as Technic models go, this one is as simple as they get. It does not offer any functionality beyond the slamming, which to be honest is not super interesting. Not to speak that the slammer tends to break into pieces if hit too hard.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice exterior design for the car<br></li><li>Good parts selection (nice red panels and bits)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A very basic set that shows little mechanical ingenuity and as such does not fit well in the Technic line<br></li><li>Slammer tends to break up<br></li></ul>
<p>Unless you are into the slammer series, I would skip this set.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,3
"Einhander","2013-03-05T22:35:21.103Z","Kind of disappointing...","<p>Got it as a gift, and I was not impressed at all.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It goes when you hit the slammer</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Extremely limited playability</li><li>Not very fun to build because of limited functionality, the slammer was more fun to build than the car</li></ul>
<p>Avoid. Not worth the money.</p>",TRUE,2,3,2,2,2
