Therefore, this (these) model(s) are really simple to build, and every vehicle could be separated in modules, an re-connected into another vehicle.
The main reason I bought this set, is that it was relatively cheap in stores and it contained reasonable amounts of newer parts (such as studless beams, and new style connector pins).
It would be a great set for a starter (child), and for an adult buider, this set has a good mix of parts to add to your collection.
What really was good about this set was the customer-friendly price (yes, i'm talking money again :) but let's be honest: considering today's price standards money IS definatly an issue on lego-models).

Cool for the parts, cool for the kids  but low challenge. 3/5 ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-12T18:00:24.59Z","Nice Starting Technic Set","This was the very first Technic set that I got. There are many things in this set that make it very useful for parts and good for playability. There are in total of nine models that can be built from this set. Also if you get the motor set, you can make tenth model with it. There is also a Technic minifigure in this set(and you can never have too many of those). I would recommend this set as a starter set or a spare parts set. Overall this set is nice to have in your Technic collection. 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's interesting in theory... there are a bunch of different &quot;components&quot; and you fit them together to make different vehicles.

But I found the implementation wasn't perfect... often you'd have to modify the individual components, or at least do more than simply putting them together to form a new vehicle.

Also, the concept further limited the creativity of the user, as many of the components were not terribly exciting.

I still managed to make some interesting things out of it, but ultimately I think I used it more as a piece set than an individual product.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
