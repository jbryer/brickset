"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-06T22:22:56.653Z","Why do I own this?","Actually, I'm not really sure why I do.  It's got to be the cheapest Technic set ever created ($4 US) and doesn't really do anything.  Ok, so the blade spins when you roll it along a flat surface, big deal.  I also don't get the random Spyrius control panel.  This set doesn't live up to the principle of Technic and it gets a 1/5.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

The Technic side of it is a simple bit of gear work. As the wheels on the bottom go round makes some gears tun and the rotor at the back turns as well mimicking that it is actually running.

The color scheme is ok with the main colors being black and yellow, with a red propeller. I also queried why it needed a Spyrius control panel but I guess it is better than nothing.

Overall it is a beginners Technic model, sort of a model that would move you from a Bionicle type of LEGO into Technic, before you hit the big technical stuff. A 5/10 from me. Get it if you want this one is really personal choice of cost and aesthetics.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-01T10:26:46.09Z","LEGO Technic - Hydro Racer Review","This set is a great little impulse set to start with building the LEGO Technic sets. It doesn't have many play features but it's fun to play with for sure. If you're maneuver this boat the propeller on the back sviwels full 360Â° due to the white rubber band. On the middle you can see a dashboard which is printed. It's the only printed piece in this set and we also don't get any stickers. We also don't get any minifigures because this set is not minifigure friendly. This boat is very durable as well. It's a good little set to get for pieces which you could use for future MOC's (My own creations) or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
