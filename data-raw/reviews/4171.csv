"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-01T10:32:53.843Z","LEGO Technic - Road Rebel Review","This set looks very cool but it almost doesn't have any play features. The only play feature you get is that you get a clear engine piece which has a yellow piston in it which moves up and down if you maneuver this car. There're also a few stickers included in this set which you need to put on. I like the way how LEGO used the pieces from the palm trees to make the black engines. This vehicle looks very fast and it's an easy set to build. This model is fun to play with as well. I think this set is a great set to start building LEGO Technic models and it's also a great set for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
