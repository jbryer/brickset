I built only main model. </p><p>It has some intersting parts:</p><ul><li>Technic Forklift Fork</li><li>Tile 1 x 8</li><li>Technic Gear 12 Tooth Bevel ! (never too many of them! pf xl breaks a lot of them inside differentials)</li><li>and technic minifigure! </li></ul><p>Why there are no technic minifigures in modern technic sets?</p><p><br></p><p>Functions:</p><ul><li>Steering of rear axle via yellow light on top</li><li>Lifting forks via rotating front mudguards</li></ul><p>Cons (i'm not listing pros because all things tahat are not cons, are pros ;) )</p><ul><li>Minifigure can easily fall of the sit while playing with model.</li><li>absolutely no suppension (but maybe real forklifts also doesnt have it?)</li><li>no decoration (in comparision to modern sets with panels this set looks ugly).  OK, not ugly, just ""Pure technic"" look.</li><li>using  12 studs long axles (maybe its not con for some people, but mine axles 12 are very easy to break, bend etc. , so imo its better to use two six studs long axles and inline connector)</li><li>The lifting mechanism is not like in real froklift (where is based on chains).</li></ul><p>Overall i think its worth the $25 I payed for this set. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
