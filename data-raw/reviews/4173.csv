Wait for it... <b>Pentium II </b>PC for Christmas! Of notable surprise for that Christmas too, I got this set which I had been wanting for some time, and had many years of play from it.<div><br></div><div>The main pulling factor was that because we had no upgraded from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95, I could use the 'CD-ROM' included with this set and play it if we ever got a new PC. Of course we did, and I was excited to find a whole new LEGO adventure on my Desktop. After loading it up recently, it seems somewhat crude and the only real pulling factor is that you can use a 3D make-up to help build the model if you didn't want the paper instructions. Why would anyone want to do that though?</div><div><br></div><div>As for the model itself, it's always stood out as being a very strong, versatile model thats surprisingly light. The 'cockpit' area of the Sub (I know... its not the real term!) can lift away and allows the diver to swim about on his own little submersible which is nice, and also includes extras such as an airtank and flippers etc on the side, as well as an additional small vehicle houses in the rear fin area.</div><div><br></div><div>Only downside is that the pneumatic air tank doesn't go along away if you're constantly levitating the Claw at the front. Though on the plus side, it was far, far easier to assemble the pneumatics than on any other Technics model I've bought, and the Claw is actually a really nice feature - not just a fancy addition.</div><div><br></div><div>In short, what we have here is a really original model and it looks just as good standing as it does when in the imagination of the builder. It was quite expensive even when bought, and I would be careful not to pay over the odds for what is a medium-sized Technics model in comparison to most others of a similar price range.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"DrFrankenstein","2012-10-07T18:21:35.897Z","One of the most imaginative Technic sets that stands out on its own","<p>The search sub set is unique amongst the Technic line for a number of reasons. It is the only Technic set centered around an underwater theme (most Technic models are transportation, farming, and construction vehicles). It is the only non-Mindstorms Technic set that features a CD-ROM with building content. Finally, the set is the only one that has the Technic diver minifigure. Therefore this set gets set high marks for imagination.</p><p>The main submarine model is nice overall. It's not particularly realistic, looking like a mashup of a unmanned robot, a crew submarine, and an underwater sleight. It's strange that the cockpit lifts up and the diver is able to swim out on a sleight. It's nice that the scuba unit and flippers can ride on the side of the sub, but one should wonder what good are they sitting outside forcing the diver to come out of the sub breatholding before donning them? However, once you overlook the weird parts of the design, the sub is actually not a bad toy. The claw works well with the air tank and is able to lift the reactor thingy securely (although it pushes the diver up, strangely). The overall shape of the submersible is nice and it does have the characteristic profile one would expect. The two wheels in the front allow the sub to ""glide"" along the bottom for a smooth approach. It's cool too that the diver can ride the autonomous underwater scooter out of the sub and attach a drill-head to it.</p><p>The build is not particularly exciting or memorable. The finished product is quite sturdy. I don't have first-hand impressions of the alternate model, but it does look rather alien. The multimedia on the CD-ROM won't run on anything but Windows 3.11/95/98, so if you want to give it a try, you will need to load it in a virtual machine. The multimedia does contain some cool graphics and animations plus build instructions and ideas (quite retro from a modern standpoint). It's a good thing that all other Technic sets don't have CDs and software, since it generates a dependency on a particular OS version and can limit the product's longevity. Luckily the set comes with printed building instructions which make the CD-ROM unnecessary. <br></p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very imaginative and unique set</li><li>Great playability</li><li>Unique minifigure<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The models in this set are anything but realistic</li><li>Retracting the claw on the main model pushes the diver up</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I would say that while this set is not a classic amongst the Techinic sets, it does stand out on its own being one of the most unique and imaginative sets Technic has produced. If you get a chance, give it a try - it's not bad at all.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
