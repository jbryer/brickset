The one in the picture above is the Sport Bike and there is an alternate model which I liked better. The alternate model is a Roadster bike and it looks very sleek, if not blocky. I recommend this set if you like Technic vehicles but have no money to spend on the newer bank-busting models.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
