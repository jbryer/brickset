It is quite playable, with quick easy reconfiguration of the buggy using the modular connecters. It also includes a nice Technic figure. (These guys are pretty rare.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This technic set is a little differint than the other ones I got by not having any real alternative model all you do is change the tires around.  The odd thing this set comes with five tires, the extra one is used manily to hook up a motor to it for an extra play feature.  This set does comes with stickers and one of them is to go on two bricks witch I refuse to do, and a bad idea in my book.  On the plus side it does come with a ""Technic Figure"" Cop kind of rare if I am remembering right.  The booklet does advertise this set can link up to other sets with the special technic pin and griper system for add play features.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The building experience is great for any Technic builder. The set includes a Technic figure which helps add to the play experience. One of the negatives to the set is that it should have included a motor like the alternative instructions suggested. Considering all this, I will state the Pros and Cons.<div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Good Building</li><li>Includes a Technic Figure</li><li>Alternative Instructions</li><li></li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>Really should have included the motor.</li></ul><div>On that last note, you could use the RCX motors to create the alternative motorized wheel.</div></div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
