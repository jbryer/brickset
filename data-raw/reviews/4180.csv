Looks like I am the first to review this. This is just the simplest function of the old Technic line. I found out that there are also functions like boxing vehicles. This function is still cool nonetheless. The vehicle can either be a helicopter or a plane, and I like the plane more (pictured here). The function where you shoot at the scorpions' tail and they flip is fun and amusing. The technic minifigure is rather pode-able.

Pros:
very play-able.
Function is fun.
Scorpions are detailed.
Interesting and easy build.
Rare colored pieces.

Cons:
None!

In all, a great classic technic set. I recommend this to any lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You've got this Technik Guy (these guys are quite rare) sitting in a flying machine and there are also these 2 spiders you must hit. I love to see the Spiders bouncing around when you hit them with the foam bullet. Another thing that I enjoy at this set is that there are purple bricks. I can't remember a Technik Set with purple bricks (can you??).<br><br>Pros:<br>-technik guy<br>-spiders<br>-purple bricks<br>-foam bullet<br><br>Cons:<br>-none<br><br>Overall this is a great set and I recommend to buy it.
