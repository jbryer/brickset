The robot stands about a foot tall, has working clamps to pick things up, movable arms, the head is movable and slides right off to allow the driver to fly around. Also comes with a small recon vehicle that parks in a small aroua in the robots feet. Robot has wheels, so it can roll around for movement.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The largest problem was that each of the models has the same 'core'.  This meant that you could choose to keep it assembled when you built a new model, or you could break it down and then rebuild it.  Basically, it seemed to eliminate some of the creativity of the set and undermined the purpose of having directions to build different models.  And individually, none of the models struck me as very impressive.

On the redeeming end, the set had a very wide variety of parts and allowed for some outside-the-box creativity in terms of free-lance building.  Overall, I would say the models were sub-par, but considering the variety and quantity of parts for the price, it is hard to totally condemn this set, as it was quite a value.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
