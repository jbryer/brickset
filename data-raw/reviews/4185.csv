I found that the front winch was actually very cool. It even had a little locking mechanism that would act like a real winch.

The rear crane also functioned well (by rotating a handle). Was just strong enough to lift the helicopter back up when it fell off a cliff ;)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-06T20:13:26.53Z","Good Technic Set","I personally think that this is a good set. I like the Technic figures which are are today. The 3 in 1 set is very good because you can make a boat, car and submarine. The only thing I don't like is that the three choices are all alternative models. Besides that, this is very good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
