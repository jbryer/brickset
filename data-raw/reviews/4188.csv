They are surprisingly poseable, although they do look a bit 'blocky'. But, they are definitely ""Technic Guys""!<br/>Their hands have a larger grip than minifigs, so making them hold lego stuff is a bit of a challenge. (They are the right size for any item which ends in a Technic 'peg'. The hands will not hold on to Lego studs or most minifig scale items.)<br/>As they have Technic peg-holes in their legs, you could make holsters or tool kits etc. They come with a helmet each. Their heads are different, and can be carefully popped out and swapped, although I wouldn't recommend this being done too often, as it will loosen the fittings and make their heads wobbly!",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
