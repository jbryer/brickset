There are quite a few specialty parts including panels, a propeller, tail, wheels, and antennae controls. The color scheme of black and yellow works nicely together and the alternate models pictured on the back of the bag are a small single seat plane, tiny watercraft and a mechanic working on a propeller. This is a great set that would have retailed for 2 bucks.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"brixton","2009-09-03T19:54:02.34Z","Too small","I got this set for free by ordering it from Kellogs years ago.  There isn't much to it.  Originally I thought the wings were great but had a change of heart when I got the Aerial Acrobats set which has much better plane wings.  The inclusion of a minifigure is great.  Without it there would be no point in picking this set up.  The Glory Glider set is just too small and simplistic.  I did not enjoy it as a kid. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"stitchfan","2011-04-17T22:34:09.9Z","The first one is always free...","<p>Possibly the best Kellogg's promotions ever, Sets 1560, 1561, 1562, and 1563 were the sets I remember most vividly as a kid. Probably because my thrifty mom earned me about 3 of each through this Promo. I still have the unmistakable parts floating through around Lego my bins after all these years, and they're still as useful.<br>

Let's just hope Kellogg's (or someone) has a deal this good again in the future!",TRUE,3,3,1,4,5
