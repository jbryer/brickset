Two players are necessary. The car races between them. You only need a smooth floor. The figure on the car is also nice. He has an helmet
 and a protective suit and he does not puke at all - despite the fast turn! First it is not easy to steer it in the right direction. If you have practiced (and have found all the hiding places under you sofa and under your cupboard) you can increase the difficulty: There is a cannon on the car that can be activated with a steerable crane-thing on either of the barricades. Then there are stopper for each opponent and different car bodies and other things too. <br>The car has a strong motor with 3 standard batteries. It was not very difficult to build it up. My 5 year old son has built it nearly allone. <br>The parts are lego technic standard. Only the motor of the car is special I think. I do not like many special parts because Lego must stay a phenomenon to build many special things out of simple parts. Since this set is ready we play it again and again and we and our onlookers are laughing very often. It is the most funny set of Lego we have. So I can really recommend to buy this set!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
