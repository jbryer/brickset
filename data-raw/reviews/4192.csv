Well anyway, this is just awful. I have trouble remembering that Nick is a Lego Figure, since there are absolutely no actual LEGO pieces at all.
The only cool thing was the punching arm. It was cool. Ka-Pow.

They are strange for Lego, but fun to mess with. Parts can easily be swaped from other members. You can put some interesting pieces in some strange places.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-08-29T15:55:27.2Z","All the positive reviews of this set have low ratings","The Galidor theme was introduced in 2002. The show might have been fine but releasing Lego sets out of it was a huge mistake. Let me re-phrase that: the WAY they released the sets was an error. If Lego wanted a Galidor theme, they should've released actual play sets with real minifigures and settings made of real Lego bricks. Unfortunately, Lego decided to launch non-Lego action figures and ultimately a whole theme with just characters from the show.<br><br>Now onto the set itself. The Nick has moveable arm and legs which can make him pose. His right arm is robotic and it has a missile-firing feature. Other than that, this set is nothing, and I don't see any use of this set for older Lego fans like myself. No recognizeable Lego parts mean I can't do anything else to integrate it into my collection.<br><br>Because the Galidor theme was so unpopular (for obvious reasons), Lego decided to discontinue the theme altogether to save themselves wasted sets that won't sell. As such, this theme did not last one year.<br><br>Overall I don't recommend this set at all. However, this set would be great for a younger age group, they will simply care about playing with it and not care that it's not Lego.<br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
