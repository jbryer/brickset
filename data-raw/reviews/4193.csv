I know this theme is based off a cartoon but surely there were more bad people they could have included in the set. Not a bad figure, a must if you have Nick or his other team members.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

He only has a energy beam for an arm and that's it. He doesn't really look like a villian in my opinion. This is a waste of your own money and don't buy it!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Broken_Cheese_Slope","2015-06-04T22:37:15.717Z","What's a Gorm?","<p>I have always wanted a Galidor set. I find their unique parts fascinating, and the story-line is well developed. But none of these are really true. I was however able to pick up 8311 recently. Gorm was released sometime in 2002 and sold for $10. He has 12 parts, which make it be nearly a dollar per part.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Build</p>

<p><br />
There is really nothing that hard about connecting 12 parts, however no instructions come with the set. Even If I could do it without the instructions other&#39;s might have trouble. After the build, 4 peg holes are left open without any known reason. (these are only on the back.)</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Parts</p>

<p><br />
This set has a &quot;large&quot; amount of parts, I will start with the arms. A very short oddly shaped part connect to the torso. It looks nothing like an upper arm when connected to Gorm. The lower arm is just as short, but skinnier. A slightly deformed and un-moving hand is connected to it. The hands look like they could hold something, but nothing comes in the set.</p>

<p>The torso might be the oddest part in the set. Towards the top is an odd purple printing that seems to look like angry eyes. Near the printing Gorm&#39;s shoulders seem to be too big. A purple printed &quot;cloth&quot; piece hands from his torso. In the back there are 4 unused holes.</p>

<p>Gorm&#39;s head looks a bit like something out of Star Wars. On the right side, he has some kind of cheetah spots. These spots seem out of place on a space overlord. On the left he has purple tubes. Gorm&#39;s right eye looks to be robotic. The left is green. We can see that Gorm has pale grey skin, which makes him seem dead. That might explain the deformed hands. Altogether his head is just strange.</p>

<p>Gorm&#39;s upper leg is pretty much a longer version of his upper arm. His lower leg is wider and has a very flat foot on the end.</p>

<p>Gorm is not life like at at all and is not proportional.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Galidor is really as bad as I thought. Don&#39;t get any of the sets. It is a waste. The set has no custom-ability whatsoever, but if you know the Galidor story line you might like these, as it has as much playabilty as all&nbsp;constraction sets.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2013-04-27T16:20:44.067Z","Gorm the Evil One","<p>Galidor is destined to go down in Lego history as probably one of the most bizarre themes conceived. Gorm here seems to be a half &nbsp;cousin to <i>Star War</i>'s Darth Vader, although that lack of creativity is more to blame on the T.V. show Galidor, than the Lego line itself. Lets dive into Gorm's attributes here...</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I have long lost the box and instructions, however a quick web search reminds us Galidor was packed in a plastic bubble, not unlike most action figures.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>If Galidor had one strength, it was the strange collection of parts used to make the figures. As such Gorm shows some MOC potential, if the MOCer is willing to find a use for these pieces. All the pieces connect together using a Ball and Pin system, which is compatible with similar systems used often Lego's mech builds (such as Exo-Force or Ninjago).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Gorm, like all Galidor figures, could hardly be considered a building toy.</div><p><b>The completed model</b></p><p>Gorm looks great as an action figure, however most Lego fans would feet cheated after the measly build. The fact Gorm looks like a cheap version of Darth Vader detracts from the finished look (if I remember right though Gorm on the T.V. show was just a guy in a rubber suit).</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As I mentioned in my Allegra review, Gorm is really only useful if you want to collect a true Lego oddity or use his pieces in a MOC. Also makes a great conversation starter with younger Lego fans who aren't aware of Galidor. Fortunately, unlike most Lego sets, Gorm can be found on the internet for sale at his original price. Now the question is whether even that price is worth it...</p>",TRUE,2,3,1,3,2
