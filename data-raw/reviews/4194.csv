The show was good, and that's why I bought it, along with most of the other ones. This isn't proper Lego. At least it's rare now. I used to by almost every Lego set, now I only buy BIONICLE. I don't know what I was thinking buying this wanna-be C3-PO,( maybe completing my Galidor collection.) but it was the last Galidor I ever bought. Now he's in a container with all the others,Good ridence! ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

I got almost the entire series of Galidor on sale right before Christmas years ago. The idea is to swap out heads or arms or legs with other caracters to create some really strange looking creatures.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2008-12-05T12:34:42.36Z","Now why did I buy this?","I can't remember why I bought this or where only that i was very little.I fail to see how this can be classed as lego.

"Danblom","2009-01-31T17:56:14.343Z","Look! A Trash Can Is On Fire!","A Peace of Waste!  This set belongs in these locations:
A Blast Furnace
A Melting Pot
A Subject to a Mob
OR a bonfire where he can join his other friends.
     A disgrace to Lego, A disgrace to All.
At least Lego doesn't start making ""Trollz"" of ""Nutario.""
