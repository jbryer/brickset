My thoughts on this set are the same as those on all other Galidor sets - it's not proper LEGO. However, this one does contain two bullets which can be used in a normal LEGO blaster, so it earns one point.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

However, Nick with wings isn't that good, so it only gets a 2. At least Lego tried to put Lego pieces in this set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
