Sorry LEGO, but Action Figures aren't the way to go.
Maybe if you had made minifig Galidor Locations with minifigs...",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

"Stubborn_Virus","2014-08-01T05:10:27Z","Good at what it does, but that doesn't mean it's worth it.","<p>I picked this ugly up in a bargain bin in 2014, for way less than the original price. However, considering the original price, I don&#39;t think it would normally be a good value. Even with some of the later Bionicle sets with low piece counts, they at least had easily compatible parts.&nbsp;The parts here are only technically compatible with standard lego, and are hard to use with moccing. (Props to anyone who actually has succeeded on that front.)</p>

<p>However, the parts are rather nicely made. The head has a nice sculpt, and I like how they designed the actual pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun with this guy, reconfiguring his limbs into eldrich abominations. Perhaps a bit too much fun, but fun none the less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably the nicest action figure I&#39;ve seen in a while, but lack of compatibility, poor price/part ratio, and that crappy cannon-arm really take it down.&nbsp;</p>
