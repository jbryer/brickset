"TBOC","2015-07-18T07:24:06.443Z","A very neat addition to a Galidor collection","<p>The Galidor sets, although not received well for several reasons that I mostly chalk up to poor design on Lego&#39;s part as well as poor planning in general, is a greatly overlooked theme. The Brickset review&#39;s I&#39;ve seen so far are abysmal, and I intend to give more quality reviews on them, as someone who has owned the sets, and currently owns them as well.</p>

<p>I bring that last fact up only because a fair amount of reviews seem to be by children who don&#39;t own the sets, and those can hardly be counted as reviews, can they?</p>

<p>I will admit though, Galidor does have a certain place in my heart. I greatly enjoyed Galidor sets when they were out simply because I was five years old. Old enough to enjoy and remember them, and young enough where I didn&#39;t try to take them too seriously.</p>

<p>That being said, it should be reminded Galidor sets are made for kids and were likely never envisioned to be collected by an adult audience. This explains their simple design and large pieces not very useful for other MOCs. That being said, I also don&#39;t know why anyone would complain about a lack of connection with Lego System.</p>

<p>Seriously, do these look like they were made to be compatible&nbsp;with normal Lego bricks? I rest my case.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly why, but the boxed Galidor sets had extremely well done packaging. The boxes are very sturdy (made of a thicker cardboard), and the smaller $20 sets included little windows that showcased several of the parts. As a very young kid when these came out, I can tell you that sort of advertising worked well on me.</p>

<p>The box for the TDN, since it is a larger vehicle, is rather big itself. Comparisons are hard, especially because the Galidor sets didn&#39;t use any of the standard Lego box sizes. It is nearly as deep as one of the blister pack sets are wide, as tall as a blister pack, and I&#39;d say as wide as the Lego Volkswagen Beetle is long.</p>

<p>Galidor packaging was also very well designed in my opinion. The black border with the Galidor logo added heavily to the futuristic sort of theme, and the large picture of the module in action over Arbo (a location from the TV show) is a very good contrast.</p>

<p>The back of the box is dominated by the instructions for the set. This is actually something I liked a lot, because you knew exactly what pieces were included in the set. This is something that really can&#39;t be done for other sets in the same way, which was a unique thing to Galidor.</p>

<p>The bottom focuses more on different pictures of the TDN Module, showing the back as well as the wing function. Also advertised are all of the first wave of Galidor sets, specifically not showing 8317: Allegra and 8320: Basic Nepol.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Being primarily action figures, the Galidor sets include few parts, and all of them tending to be large pieces. The TDN is no exception, having only 9 parts. This accounts for a pretty bad piece-to-price ratio, although I feel like that&#39;s a fairly flawed system normally.</p>

<p>Also the main piece is giant and would probably not be worth only 10 cents.</p>

<p>Noticeably, the parts included for the module are not compatible with the other Galidor sets. This is because the normal technic pin that connects the parts is instead a rubberized axle, which is slightly oversized and unable to fit in a normal technic pinhole. This is because they attach to the module piece, which has unique pinholes that are meant to more easily hold up the ship.</p>

<p>This means, however, if you intended to buy it for the Jens feet and Power wings, you will be sorely disappointed. However, none of those parts are exclusive to the set and can be found with normal pins in 8312: Jens and 8313: Nick Deluxe respectively.</p>

<p>The main focus of the set is the module piece, which is very large and can hold a standard sized Galidor figure inside, Nick Bluetooth being the recommended one. I&#39;d image Allerga and Jens could easily fit, perhaps Gorm as well, and Nepol and Eurpidies could certainly be crammed into the space without their tools.</p>

<p>The bullets for the wings, despite being nearly identical to the normal Technic competition bullets, do not have the pinholes that allow connection. The wings are the spring-loaded cannons, and are perhaps one of my favorite Galidor parts in terms of design.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As you could expect for a set that can print the instructions on the back of the box, it is simple. Plug in the four legs, the two wings, and insert the bullets into the wings. Building is a secondary function to the action.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed TDN is a larger set that would dominate a Galidor display. The main function of the set is to play with it, and it does deliver in that aspect. The cockpit can fit a single Galidor figure as mentioned earlier, and the wings can fire the bullets at targets or other figures (but not your face, as any Lego set would warn).</p>

<p>Playability, past wooshing around the vehicle (a very fun thing to do, I may mention) is heavily reliant on other sets. That&#39;s sort of a detriment due to it being a $40 set on it&#39;s own, so an included figure would have made more sense. Perhaps an included Nick or Allegra would have worked, considering the price point.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Compared to the TV counterpart it was based off of, this is a very poor rendition. The coloring isn&#39;t the same (chalked up to how primitive the decals of the time were compared to nowadays, and the difficulty of printing such a large piece), the legs are done differently (each have the upper leg piece of Jens in the show), and the lack of an interior.</p>

<p>The interior is a hard thing to have replicated though, and to be honest a TDN works a lot better in a minifigure based Galidor. I think a sort of action figure/system model would have worked better, with action figures as they were done, but larger sets system based with minifigures. In the end, this would have been a better rendition.</p>

<p>The price point is rather high as well, and I certainly feel bad for anyone who bought the sets before the extreme discounts began as stores tried to clear stock quickly. However, the TDN is one of the more expensive on the secondary market, with people trying to sell them for $50+ sealed. I bought my own for $11, only opened to verify contents, approximately&nbsp;13 years after the sets disappeared off the shelves. If you really want one, and are scouring the net for one, check eBay every so often, one will show up.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe this is a fun add on set if you have other Galidor figurines. Despite its flaws, it works as an entertaining set for younger kids, and a cool looking model for older kids. I keep mine unopened, although I do still have my one from 2002, battered and broken.</p>

<p>If Galidor isn&#39;t exactly your thing, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. This doesn&#39;t have the playability of the other sets, but is more of an accompaniment to the figurines. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a must for a fan of the show, though. Even if not for play, it looks very good among my other sets in storage.</p>
