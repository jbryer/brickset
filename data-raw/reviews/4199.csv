While on vacation in Nebraska I came across this and it was on sale too. She is the only female in the series and in my neck of the woods she is very hard to come by. Allegra and her side kick dog? deserve a solid four stars due to the fact it took over a year of looking to find her and reunite her with the rest of the gang.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Also, the dog looks uglier as a robot and should have been just a regular dog. Galidor is the worst theme ever made and everyone knows why.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"xboxtravis7992","2013-03-02T16:34:37.263Z","Odd set in a Quirky theme","<p>Galidor was a weird theme; a tie in to a now forgotten television show; a product more appropriate for an action figure maker than Lego. Galidor has gathered a lot of hate from Lego fans, due to it not using traditional Lego bricks. Allegra showcases both the weakest aspects of Galidor, and its occasional strong points.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Parts are probably the main reason to justify getting this set. As with all Galidor sets, Allegra has unique parts, only seen in this set. The parts use a pin and socket connection which can be combined with standard Technic pieces. Both Allegra and the head of the dog-<i>thing</i> show potential uses in MOC's. The dog-<i>thing's</i> body also aligns with the studs of a standard Lego base plate offering a unique dark grey piece, however the dog-<i>thing</i> body lacks the tubes found in standard Lego bricks, leading to very weak clutch power.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>What build? As in all Galidor products, Allegra could hardly be called a building toy.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As with most Galidor model's Allegra looks great as an action figure, but very poor as a Lego model. Allegra loses playability due to her joint-less one-piece arms. There are some play options with the ability to swap limbs (""glinching"" as the show called it) with other Galidor figures, but other than that Allegra is no more or no less playable than any other action figure.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Galidor has enough use as the occasional Nice-Part-Usage in MOC's, which alone makes them worth keeping. The model is also a great action figure, even if it is a horrible Lego set. Part of the appeal of Galidor; more than a decade after they left the market, is that these sets represent a weird quirk in Lego history. If anything they make a great conversation piece when you tell new Lego fans that Galidor was <i>actually</i> a Lego product. Ultimately Allegra &nbsp;is worth picking up only if it can be found for <i>really insanely&nbsp;cheap</i> prices, if only for its MOC potential and oddity status.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,4,1,3,2
