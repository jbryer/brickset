also, this guy has a clever eye-open to eye-squint feature.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Galidor stinks! I don't know where I got this figure, but I have it!
Pros:
It's funny when you light his head with fire
Cons:
Not really LEGOs
The whole thing!
I would trade this for a piece of sand, the person I traded it to would be ripped off!
DON'T GET THIS SET!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"MrHeadache","2009-12-12T15:37:11.17Z","I don't this is all that bad.","I think, to make this review easier, I will just do pros/cons.

Pros:
Nice visor thing
Spring-loaded claw arm that could be used in minifig-scale models
Looks cool
Parts can be mixed and matched if you have other Galidor figures
Neck-fluff is detachable, though this isn't much use
Colour scheme works well

Cons:
Parts CAN be mixed and matched, but when you do so, it doesn't really work; the only thing that you can do that works well is the original design...
Shield on stomach looks a bit weird

Overall, this isn't exactly a must-have, but it's not a bad set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
