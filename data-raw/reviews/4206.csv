I'm not sure why-maybe I just didn't mind the fact that no matter WHAT you got, it really was useless for combining with other sets (except for Nepol and Shimmel (one set) and Nepol). I saw something similar in the 2010 Hero Factory-just action figures. I see the same in the 2011 Hero Factory, but worse. The builds are all the same. However, the Galidor parts are unique in that they are incredibly odd (Steve Puckett actually has made AMAZING use of Galidor parts).<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It was boring. He's outlined in blue-why? I don't know.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has parts that look awesome, but really are not useful for anything else. The staff really looks cool-this was always my favorite set, after the TDN module.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>Build? What build?<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks great. Because it's useless for the main purpose of LEGO-which is building. If an action figure company had launched this line, they probably could have made actual money. But for LEGO-this was an all-time low.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I really don't recommend this set. If you REALLY want some Galidor parts for your collection, just get them on bricklink.<br></p>",TRUE,2,1,1,3,1

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about Galidor before, and how pretty much every lego fan hates the theme. I always thought it was stupid too, at least before I bought this little sucker. I picked up a brand new&nbsp;Euripides&nbsp;at a flea market. He was selling for $15, but the owner bargained with me for $10. He told me that a lot of people had looked at him and put him back down. I could tell this was true, because of the amount of dust, dirt and grime on the packaging. Go figure. I couldn&rsquo;t resist owning a strange part of Lego history.&nbsp;Anyway, let&rsquo;s get on with my review of this oddity.</p>

<p><strong>The Figure Itself:</strong></p>

<p>I know every lego fan likes to hate on Galidor because of the fact that almost no parts of the sets are usable with the rest of the toys lego has made, not to mention that the figures are mostly ugly. But I think Euripides is a cool looking figure.&nbsp;What intrigues me the most about this figure is all of the wacky parts. Galidor&rsquo;s figures all have brand-new molds&nbsp;and parts that were never seen again in the Lego system.&nbsp;Euripides contains 10 pieces: a head, two arms, two shoulder pieces, one large body piece, an armor&nbsp;piece, two legs, and a staff. All the pieces are a hard plastic, with the exception of the head, which is a hard rubber piece. The eye printing on the head is&nbsp;pretty nice. The lime green contrasts well with the dark green.&nbsp;There are a few anti-studs on the bottom of his feet, so you COULD connect him to bricks, though I have yet to test his clutch power on a baseplate.&nbsp;Once you get past the fact that this is a Lego toy, the figure isn&rsquo;t half bad. The sculpts for the parts are really nice and detailed, and you can tell a lot of effort was put into them. The one issue I have with the overall figure is the small bit of gold printing on his torso. It comes off quite easily. My figure has been in the box for so long, yet it already shows signs of wear because of the scratches on the gold. This goes for the staff as well, which has gold on both ends.</p>

<p><b>Building Experience:</b></p>

<p>Building? What building?&nbsp;This is a Galidor set. Euripides comes pre-assembled in the box. There are no instructions, only a piece of paper advertising the other sets. You could glinch the parts of another set to this one, or the other way around, which counts for something.</p>

<p><b>Part Usability:</b></p>

<p>Like I said before, Galidor parts can&rsquo;t really be used for much, though I have seen some really cool MOCs from a person named Steve Puckett. They can be used though, you just have to get really,&nbsp;REALLY creative.&nbsp;The Galidor parts use the same kind of Technic connector pieces that are used in sets like Creator, Chima, Nexo Knights, Technic (obviously) and Ninjago. You could combine Galidor parts with these other pieces, and then build with bricks to create a mech or a monster. That&rsquo;s all these could really be used for. You can also swap out Euripides&rsquo; parts with any of the other Galidor set pieces, which the show calls &ldquo;glinching.&rdquo; This is the best way to use his parts. His staff that he comes with is too large to be used by a normal minifigure. There are ways you could use this though: you could build a giant lego monster or mech, and have it hold this as a weapon. Or you could just use it with other Galidor sets, which is what it is&nbsp;meant for.</p>

<p><b>Playability:</b></p>

<p>If you are a young child, you could play the heck out of this set. If you own other Lego sets, Euripides could function as a giant Kaiju monster to destroy your town, city or castle, or maybe as a foe for your normal sized minifigures to battle. If you are a fan of the show, you could also play the heck out of this set. Swapping parts from other sets (glinching) can create hours of fun, but only if you own a few other sets. You can also have your other Galidor figures battle each other, which could be fun for a kid. If you&rsquo;re an adult, however, this set won&rsquo;t do much. It&rsquo;s best as a display piece to have on your shelf.</p>

<p><b>Final Verdict:</b></p>

<p>While Galidor might not have been the best theme, it&rsquo;s odd and rare parts make the line&nbsp;worth collecting. Euripides is a (mostly) high quality figure, and in my opinion, definitely worth checking out. Thank you for reading my review.</p>
