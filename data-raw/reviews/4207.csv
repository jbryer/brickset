"Risebell","2018-07-10T00:33:37.14Z","A fantastic leap into the mysterious and unknown potential of constraction","<p>Tager is a weird one for sure, only released in Europe and a VERY limited release remote parts of the USA as far as I&#39;m aware. The set itself also has some of the rarest pieces ever made by lego, which is, well, the entire set.</p>

<p>Tager himself was a formidable foe for Nick Bluetooth, and his appearance is captured quite well here in this toy. He&#39;s an outlandish alien with popping colors. Not to mention- his left eye, the camera, even moves!&nbsp;</p>

<p>All around, he&#39;s another great addition to the Galidor line. For those willing to pick him up, he&#39;ll be a great display piece in any Galidor collection.</p>
