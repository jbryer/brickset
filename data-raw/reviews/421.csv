"bmwlego","2007-12-30T13:03:56Z","Stunt Chopper ","Great little promo set. It actually looks like it could have been sold by itself for about 2 bucks. It includes a pilot minifig and specialty pieces such as a propeller, copter rotors, an extra visor for the helmet, and 2 1x6 bars that connect teh landing gear to the copter body. The alternate models include a small stunt plane, a row boat with dock and a small watercraft. Not a bad set at all.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"stitchfan","2011-04-17T22:34:20.33Z","The first one is always free...","<p>Possibly the best Kellogg's promotions ever, Sets 1560, 1561, 1562, and 1563 were the sets I remember most vividly as a kid. Probably because my thrifty mom earned me about 3 of each through this Promo. I still have the unmistakable parts floating through around Lego my bins after all these years, and they're still as useful.<br>
</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Free Lego sets!<br>
</li><li>Simple sets, good parts<br>
</li><li>Great for beginners just starting with Lego</li><li>Good for play time, since they come with mini figures and moving parts<br>
</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li><br>
Not many parts to work with, leaving limited re-build options as stand-alone sets</li><li>Simplicity and few parts might leave the experienced Lego builder uninterested<br>
</li></ul><br>

Let's just hope Kellogg's (or someone) has a deal this good again in the future!",TRUE,3,3,1,4,5
