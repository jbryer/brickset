All in all, a excellent set. I would recommend it to someone with an already large collection of racers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tonga256","2007-10-11T03:52:08.2Z","wee!","this set is really cool it comes with a ramp witch it can jump on. The only bad thing is it spins around alot not forwards but it's better than others, it has a pull back moter!

GOOD.
pull back moter,
doesn't take up much space.

BAD.
spins around alot and doesn't go forward much.

This set comes with a ramp and the racer. I lost the ramp :( ,but the car still entertains me today with its pull-back motor. And it turns during its drive! I really like this set and if you like racers, I recommend that you get it!

Some wheels and a nice ramp finish the inventory. The colours chosen gives an elegant look to it.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, the build is really simple. It only takes a few steps to finish the racer due to the fact that is built around the pull back motor, wich is really big.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But, the result its great, I love the set, the motor is really strong. It still works like the first day (I got it back in 2003), and the ramp its a nice addition. I´s actually hard for me to accomplish a clean jump, but the playability in a set this small its surprising.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not a complete minifig, Its a small base that simulates a small minifig body, and a head (a really nice one, and the printed helmet its superb). This isn´t a con, because a normal body looks way to big in this small racer, so overall is Ok.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>-Great model overall.</div><div>-Really strong pull back motor, the car goes really fast.</div><div>-The addition of a ramp is always welcome.</div><div>-Some useful printed pieces.</div><div>-Excellent colour scheme.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>-It may be very small for some people, but for the price is fair.</div><div>-A not so good building experience.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall this one deserves a 5/5 from me.</div>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
