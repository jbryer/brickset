but i should mention that in each of the 3 set's instructions there are building steps for a 4th model, the &quot;night sprinter&quot;, to be assembled out of the parts of all 3 sets. it's not bigger than the latter, and doesn't look much better, it just consists mainly of black parts. *yawn* well, so much for that.
