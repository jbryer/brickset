Wish they were a little bigger so that a full size mini figure would fit. Simple set that will easily go 20+ feet across a room(hardwood floor - not carpet). Fun inexpensive litte set to add to your collection - kids love it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"46joe46","2007-11-08T18:45:36.92Z","Marvelous to fiddle with","Great little set I got last christmas - it was the first present I opened just after midnight and was so great, it now sits on my computer desk and is great to fiddle with whilst I'm waiting for things to load(which happens often).

Pros:
Great looking head
Pull back car - great to race
Can be made into bigger model(Night Sprinter) with two other sets(8358 and 8360)
No stickers - design printed onto the plastic is always best

Cons:
Not a real minifigure
Not alot of pieces and therefore it can't really be made into anything else
Does red really go with desert?

Overall a real minifigure would of been nice, but the head is good and can be used elsewhere and being a pull back car is just marvelous.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-20T10:19:36.593Z","Strange Racer...","This Racer is very strange, as it has a head and a special 2x2 ""driver"" piece to go with it! It has a pull-back motor, and, um, that's it!

Pros:

Pull-back motor
Cool head

Cons:

Strange ""body""
Strange design
Not many features

Overall, an average set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
