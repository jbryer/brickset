It is so fast, it just wont go anywhere, it just spins around in circles, but it is so fun to watch.

Pros:
Easy build
Fast Engine
Cool colors

Cons:
Spins all the time",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-24T14:45:37.31Z","Boring...","This car isn't great. The driver is just a head attached on a 2x2 driver ""body"". Also, the design is boring, as it has no interesting features.

Pros:

Pull-back motor

Cons:

Everything else!

Overall, not a good set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
