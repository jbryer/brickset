"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-07T08:14:57Z","World Champion!","I bought this the weekend of the Bahrain Grand Prix which Just happened to be the one where both Ferraris came fist and second and this set is also a winner. I previously made the Williams and thought that was good, but this is even more accurate. I have however modified the design by lowering the rear end by using an earlier version of the pull back motor as the one here is a higher version with the moulded shock absorber and makes the rear of the car too high. I also modified the area on top of this to be more accurate using the pictures of the real thing on the box. There are lots of stickers including alternatives for Schumacher or Barrichello so you can own two if you like -I will certainly get another. This would have been a 10 if they had used the lower pullback motor and tweaked the rear area to be a little more accurate.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-17T02:38:11Z","Great playability","I have a five year old and we built this together.  (me guiding him) The pullback motor is great and added alot of fun to a nice looking set.  For his age, easier to control than the smaller pullbacks and more fun and faster than if it would have been battery powered.  Motor is very fast and car shatters quite dramiticly.  All in all a really fun set and cheap.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

However, the stickers are really a problem. Just don't put them on. Besides that, this is pretty good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"adik_sa_lego","2007-12-05T02:45:18.577Z","i like 8142 better","8142 has more detail, is bigger, and looks more like the actual car than this.

The only advantage this set has over the 8142 is the minifig, and building the chassis was interesting.

I doubt if this is 1:24 since it is also way shorter than the 8142. it also has a high profile, unlike real F1 cars which have a very low profile, especially the front wing.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-20T10:23:39.047Z","GO FERRARI!","This is the first Ferrari Racer LEGO has made, and it looks great! Pull-back motor, adjustable barge-boards, great-looking wings, and cool side-pods!

Pros:

Pull-back motor
Great wings
Adjustable barge-boards
Cool side-pods

Cons:

Odd driver

Overall, a great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MisterG","2021-07-24T11:06:44.723Z","Formula 1 model","<p>LEGO has released many Ferrari F1 cars. You can use them to play and build with. You can also collect them as show models. In the latter case, appearance and scale are important.</p>

<p>Then I agree with <strong>A_Brickset_User</strong> that the pull back engine is too big for this scale.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the Technic Axle 10 is too long for the front wheels, making them stick out too far. Axle 8 would be a better choice. Finally, the Flag 2 x 2 Trapezoid should be red.</p>

<p><strong>adik_sa_lego</strong> compares this Ferrari to the 8142. The box of that set indeed says 1:24, but using Sariel&#39;s LEGO unit converter I calculated that the scale is 1:20. If so, it is correct that they are also larger. The minifig heads don&#39;t fit this scale very well.</p>

<p>The 8362 is not the first F1 that LEGO released. In 1997 the Ferrari Formula 1 Racing Car (set 2556) was released.</p>
