"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-30T16:37:35Z","It's okay...","Box-2/2-Very appealing, big enough to store pieces and instructions
Instructions-1.5/2-rip easily, 164 Pages! Needs new bindings.
Pieces-1/1.5-Many pieces, very unique, but some not interchangeable with other sets
Build-1/1.5-Pretty good, building some parts are boring and a pain in the butt
Play-2/2-The best part of the entire thing! Fun for hours, each race different.
Value-.5/1-Very well done, but $90 is a little steep for this set

Overall: If you've got $90 laying around, buy it. It gets an 8/10 from me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"GBP_Chris","2016-09-22T18:49:29.763Z","Fun for kids, less appeal for adult fans.","<p>A long while ago I received this set for Christmas, when I was in third or fourth grade if I recall correctly. Lots of memories with this race track, specifically racing my younger brother and trying to modify the track.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>All I remember about the box was that it was massive. The instructions are fairly lengthy and are quite repetitive, and while we&#39;re at it, my physical copy did not age well. It&#39;s so heavy and massive that it is very easy to tear up the pages. Best to use an online version if you wish to build the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of massive track pieces, as expected. Not very much application outside being a racetrack, but the rest of the pieces have their uses. Road signs, technic elements, plus a decent amount of plates and bricks. The two charging stations require 2 AA batteries a piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four minifigures are included, representing Team Nitro, Team Maverick, Team H.O.T., and Team Exo. They are little more than molded driver bodies with a head and a helmet, not worthwhile for minifigure collectors but perfect for the cars. Easily their best features are the helmets, with some very nice printing worth utilizing elsewhere.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very repetitive&nbsp;in places, but with enough variety to keep interest. A lot of mechanisms to regulate traffic flow and a fair amount of &quot;traps&quot; for blocking opponents. Decently quick for an AFOL, took me a while as a KFOL back when I first got it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished build is easily about four feet long and two feet wide - best on a table for racing and building. Charging and racing the cars is fun, though it requires a degree of creativity to create racing rules and competition. Only two chassis are included, so the car bodies can be swapped out and the racers mixed and matched.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For nostalgia&#39;s sake or the sake of a fun interactive racetrack, I recommend this set. It&#39;s fairly fun to run the cars and the customization potential is worth noting as well. I&#39;m battling to think of any value this set would have for collectors or MOC artists, but the whole goal of Lego is to inspire creative building and play. I think this set accomplishes such an end, even if at least on a kid&#39;s scale.</p>
