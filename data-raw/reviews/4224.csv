I personally think's it's a lot cooler than the 8466, 8428 and the 8448. It also better and have a better design then the 8458 and 8461. 10/10 - the best LEGO var ever!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-27T19:29:41Z","Great Model! Milestone in Lego fun toys!","I have this hot racer since christmas. I&#180;ve seen it at TRU while searching Explore stuff for my 2 years old son, and then I saw this baby and was immediately reminded of the 8860 (the legendary big lego car from 1980) that I had in my young days. Someone has recognized my attention to this and on christmas I found it under the tree :)

Its fast and furious - too fast and too furious for indoor use. I have the chance to drive it unlimited throughout the flat since we can run circles through several rooms. Usually my son is going to catch the car while drive he pedal truck or his bike - but forget it, the RC Racer is too fast. 

The motors are unbelievable powerful. I am going to build my own design soon, but I have to say I am going to insert a speed reduction gearing which would solve three problems:

1. Reduce speed to a more useable &quot;indoor&quot; amount.
2. Extend the useability of the batteries. Usually batteries get quickly discharged until a stage where the power is too low to move the car. But those batteries are not empty. A lego intelli train will run 2-4 weeks daily use from my son with those batteries I need to remove from the 8366...
3. It will make the new design even more powerful regarding climbing carpets etc.

The only things I really miss on this set is bumpers as seen in the 8475 (which is definetly on my list) and that Exoforce has not shown any concepts themselves for the third motor use. I have already plans to build a fully outdoor enabled excavator which I will use to clean the floor from the explore / duplo pieces after my son went to bed. That is going to be great fun!

I think the piece is well priced at most stores, don&#180;t look for Legos recommended price. Its not cheap but really worth the fun you get.

At first I thought its a bit breakable, but until now it survived even hardest crashes and no piece was really broken. Sometimes some piece are loosen during crashes, but better this than breaking them appart.

Compared to a &quot;standart&quot; RC car this is much more fun, more intuitive and surprisingly fast fast fast, believe me.

The new steering system is pretty ingeniously.

IMHO this is definetly the 10 out of 10.

Btw, my technic driver puppet from the cybermaster is now its driver - perfect match! This looks like a real F1 car now...

I guess all good things come at a price!","When this set was released, I must admit it drove me mad, almost to the point of insanity. It far outshone the previous RC cars in terms of looks and the catalog images were mouthwatering. I couldn't wait a second longer, so I immediately got my greedy (?) hands on it...somehow: The price was pretty darn painful!

Now, to the details of the set. At the time of writing, I have owned the set for over 5 years and I am still quite content with it and that's saying something! Usually my sets just stand bleakly on the shelves and gain dust-collector status in no time! 

The set was a bit of a challenge to put together, but that's only because I was so excited to build it that I made a few careless errors. Once completed, I was not disappointed. With the finishing touches rendered super-effective courtesy of the stickers, the completed RC car was a head-turning beauty! The road wheels gave it the necessary classy look of a sports car, while the 2 extra slick ones (which are pure black and should be fixed as rear wheels) allowed it to skid, do 360s, and gave it an overall appearance of coolness.

Size-wise the car is commendable, although dwarfed when placed next to my newly purchased Ferrari 1:8. Nonetheless, I still love it. I just feel strangely exhilarated when I feast my eyes on the vehicle, and when I see the new RCs that have been released since, I laugh out loud, for in my view I own the best of them! Although I must say the Track Turbo RC (8183) seems a pretty good buy in terms of appearance vs. price...hmmm...I think I might get that just for racing's sake!

The alternate model is quite refreshing - it looks rather like a buggy and the front wheels stand up when you accelerate - pretty cool huh?

I hope this review was helpful, even though I realize that it is no longer available in shops to purchase. Those of you reading this most probably really want the set and I'm sure you are voraciously foraging on ebay in a desperate bid to get your hands on it. In my opinion, for what it's worth, you should go for it! Bid as much as you possibly can! This IS a set worth getting! It's up to you; do you love RCs cars as much as I do?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
