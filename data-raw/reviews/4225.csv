"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-27T06:09:25Z","Awsome car","This car is unbeliveable, it goes where non of my other RC cars goes, on loose rocks, in the garden, in the mud, in the sand on the beach - it simply keeps going.

Battery last around 15 minutes, and takes around 2.5 hours to charge, but there are a quick charger (less than 1 hour) on it way and a high performance battery that will run for 50 minutes!

You are able to change the front and rear suspension with a single click, so its adjusted for the road or off the road.

The remote control is easy operated by me, and the manual gear shifts works great, but my son (3 years) have trouble holding it and operating both power and stearing at the same time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-27T16:27:03Z","BIG, fast, addictive,  indestructible  and FUN!","I just got this four days ago.  I've had to recharge it four times, not because of a crappy battery pack, but because I'm just having WAY too much fun with it!  The nylon parts are flexible, and they do withstand a beating.  

This thing is BIG, Indestructible, Fast, and FUN!!

This car is designed for outdoor use, and it's got a tip-tronic speed adjustment on the control unit that really jacks up the speed of the unit.  The range on this is great--I estimate a range of about 100 feet (or about 3-4 houses on a street)

I have tried to see if I can break this car apart--it's just not possible!  regular technic items can be attached to the car body, but I don't recommend it, as  it does flip from time to time, but with the amount of speed on this thing, it can only be expected.  There are three separate models to be made.  It's great fun jumping this thing off curbs and the like.  Sensitive steering makes this thing corner very fast as well.  The attachable parts are made of a different material--one that withstands the rigors of rollovers and smacking into posts and sidewalk curbs...

Kudos to LEGO for branching out into a new realm of product, and delivering a product that's true to their core morals..&quot;only the best is good enough&quot;.  I've built this car once, and I have not yet had to do anything more than flip it over after it lands upside down from a good roll.

I would like to see a service pack with additional colors (for times when racing three cars, and maybe some extra knobby tires for items like deep grass (I did get mine stuck in some deep grass).  I did find that if you take it fast enough, it can traverse grass--provided it gets a running start...I have not yet had a chance to run it through mud, but it does fly across large gravel/stones.

All in all, an excellent product--this is a definite must have for Lego fan who wanted an RC car, and needs a little sun on his/her face...

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-03T08:45:31Z","Great fun!","My new year's resoluton this year was not to buy any sets at full retail. I had been doing pretty well (except for the Maersk ship, or course!), but having seen this set demonstrated at LEGOLAND Windsor, I just had to buy one, whatever the cost!

Previous RC cars have been Technic based which means loads of small fragile parts and tears when it crashes. While they could be used outside, they really weren't designed to be; they were more at home on a (typical Scandanavian
) wooden floor.

This one, though, is different. Every part (except the aerial) is new and has been designed specifically for rough handling. The three main components (front axle, receiver/battery box, rear axle/motors) are made from a very hard plastic, and are sealed from dust and water.  Everything else is made from a flexible plastic (some have said it's Nylon, but I'm no expert) and when it is put together the whole thing acts as a shock absorber.

The set, which contains 51 parts, can be put together in several configurations to make vehicles suited to different terrains including 'rough', grass and tarmac. The suspension can be loosened and stiffened or even disabled due to the clever design of the two shock absorber units.

The car is powered by a 7.2v NiMH 1400mAH rechargable battery, and seems to be a standard size for RC cars. It charges in about 3.5 hours and powers the car for about 20 minutes. 

The remote control unit is the same as that used in previous sets. The paddle controls are used to change gear and thus reduce/increase the speed. 

I have had the car about a week now and have given it a good thrashing at my local park in dried mud, grass, gravel and bark chippings. It performs admirably on all, and as far as I can see nothing has been damaged or marked, except for the aerial which now has a kink in it; it's fairly easy to roll the car on grass if you turn too sharply, but on loose surfaces it's fine.

This is not LEGO as we know it, but the set is much better as a result. 

At &#163;90 is's a tad expensive, but that's the same price as the other Technic RC cars so from that point of view it's good value. It'll be even better value after Christmas in the inevitable Argos 1/2 price sale, but my advice is to go out and buy it now while the sun is shining and enjoy the long summer evenings thrashing this around garden.

Too easy but thats the only problem!It makes a loud  noise wich is COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL! Its so fun that I dont mind the short battery life. Its a lot better than the Red Beast but im not to sure how to adjust the suspention. If anybody knows please email me at Thewoodyway@hotmail.com. Cheers.

I played with the set,which only took an hour.
I discovered that its horsepower was 20hp/400rpm.
It was ever so cool!

Well, I can hardly call this set 'real' Lego, looks like they designed some new blocks for this buggy ...

I really really like it, it is awesome, great toy to play with... Very fast, 3 gears (unseen!)..

Why I gave it 9, and not a 10?  I don't like the construction with the 2 yellow 'soft' bricks which are installed as a part of the rear suspension. I'm afraid they won't last long the way I use this car ...

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T11:39:41Z","FUN!! And very good quality too!I","I love this car, and my boy (almost 8) loves it too. Much better than other cars we have tried.

It feels like the set is very high quality. All parts are well made and feels solid. The resulting car is also very solid, runs fast and with a very responsive steering. It takes some time to get used to it.
The construction with only electrical contact between the three main parts is very clever, and I enjoy changing the configuration and look of the car slightly. Lego has made a car that really fulfils their principle of high quality snap together toys.

What I now want to know is where I can buy spare parts, and if somebody is taking suggestions for new parts. :-)) I would for instance really like a plate that can be used to make the car longer. 

Another reviewer mention a high capasity battery. Does anybody know where they can be found?
The set comes with a 7.2 volt battery, but the dealer insisted that I could use 9.6 volt batteries as long as the plug fitted. Does anybody know if this is correct?
Please answer to onymoen@eunet.no if you have any answers. And soon the battery is recharged and I/we can play some more. :-))",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-04T04:32:44Z","Incredible car!","I have got this car and it's just incredible! Building the car was a bit easy (i'm 12 years old)though. But that doesn't matter.

Then i tested the car inside and my cat got very scared!
This thing is so fast! It's good that lego called this thing &quot;dirt crusher&quot; because it really crushes everything(sometimes also things you don't like that they get crushed). 

I'm going to Zwitserland soon and then i will test the dirt crusher in the snow :-)

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T06:46:08Z","Great, but with some problems","I agree with most reviews. The set is powerful and great. However, after a month of playing with it, the wheel motors stopped working. I though it was a battery problem and bought a new one. Same problem. On a command to move forward, the red light on the switch would go dimmer and a buzzing sound could be heard. The wheels can turn by hand, so they are not stuck. I opened the set, and gave power to the motors, but still they don't move. There is no problem with steering. I will call the dealer tomorrow, but have no idea what they will do and whether it is covered by warranty...

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-28T09:33:52Z","Still great!","I posted a review here on Jan 7, just after buying the car. Now I have two and they are both working great. I (and my 8 year old boy) have been using them all winter as there hasn't been much snow. They handle the cold without problems, but the original tyres aren't much good on snow and ice. I solved that problem by buying some real knobby tires that fittet outside of the original ones. Works great, but the engine or the controller gets a bit tired (possibly warm) after a while and the car doesn't go so well then.
Now I have removed the snow tires and taken it out for the first spring run. The snows are (almost) gone and the rocky area I mainly drive on is dry. The cars lowed it and runs easier with the original tires.

As an improvement I have bought new 3000mAh batteries that lasts about 25 minutes. A big improvement on the 1400mAh batteries that come with the set. I have also bought a new charger.
As an improvement on the cars I have bought oil filled shocks as the original ones tended to stick all the way in - which didn't do anything good for the driving quality.

But I still love the cars, and they are unique in that they can take a lot of water. And after a dirty trip I just use the shower on them.

Proposed improvements:
- Winter tires (make available)
- Better shocks (that dont stick in the bottom)
- Less sensitive steering
- A way to adjust the steering so the cars go
  straight.
- Easy avalibility of spare parts
- More sets in the same series with 
  interchangable parts
  - Stronger engine
  - Double battery pach holder
  - Tractor tracks (for snow and soft sand)

Conclusion:
   It's great!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-23T06:42:01Z","It's just not lego","I got this set about a 2 weeks ago and was impressed with its performance. However Its just not lego. The battery life is not brilliant put concidering you only have to charge it for 3 hours you can use it just as much per day as most other rc vehicles. The build quality is very good, in fact i would say that you could not break this car with regular back-yard use. However the build time is very fast and there are no many pieces. The most impressive part of the set was the motor and gearbox. After about a week i decided to experiment with it. I cracked open the drivetrain cover and revoved the motors, servos and other electronics and combined them with the 8880 super car. This is still a work in progress but so far everything works and i highly recomened anyone who has a 8880 super car and the dirt crusher, and any technical know-how to try this. (Beware doing this will void the warranty)

Yes fast enough at 14mph, powerful enough to do donut spins easily. I agree the range of the transmitter is poor about 5-6m at best.

The steering and acceleration are difficult to control accurately, but this does not spoil the driving experience.

Essentially not lego as the modular parts are not strictly technic.

The battery is a 7.2v NIMH 1400mah, which lasts about 14-20 mins. I used a new 7.2v NIMH 3900mah, works great and will last a lot longer than the 1400, however does take longer to recharge!
