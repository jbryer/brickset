"superbrick","2010-06-13T23:05:16Z","really bad set","<p>Out of all the drome motorcycle sets, this is probably the worst one. The bike always falls after you pull the motor back. The motor is slower than all the others. One pro is the parts are really nice.</p>
<p>Overall I think it is a really terrible set.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of buying all four motorcycle sets, skip this one.</p>",TRUE,2,4,2,2,3
"Legofan1300","2012-11-03T17:28:42.163Z","Cool set but expensive","<p>This set is fantastic. My parents bought it to me when i was 5, but i didn't pay too much atention to it. now I'm 13 and I see its value. for little kids it's maybe a&nbsp;bit challenging. </p>
<p>It's a bit expensive for what it is but it's worth it if you are a pullback lego vehicle fan.</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,3,2
