so it's a players, not a collectors item i suppose.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-07-07T13:46:30.327Z","more a technic set","what I mean is that this set only has two system pieces. there are the headlight (which is a round tile piece with a sticker) and the 2x2 round brick. and believe it or not all the other pieces are technic. I am not sure if the tyres are system but I don't think the are. I am not really bothered about the fact this set only has two system pieces it's just I thought racers sets had more system pieces.
