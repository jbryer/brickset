"A_Brickset_user","2003-02-07T00:00:00Z","","This set looks very good.  Not many overlarge pieces and a nice array of slopes and wedges.  I hope that those prints are stickers- if they were printed, they would severly limit the use of many parts.  But otherwise, a nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The details are excellent, eventhough they are mstly stickers. I normally don't like stickers on Lego sets, but it works here. How can you have a F1 car without the myriad of logos of the supporting companies? 

A must buy, considering it is only $12.99!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The detail on Ralph Shumacher/Juan Pablo Montoya is really class! Over all i really do like this set and id recomend it to anybody!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I even gave him a name!<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Nice colours!</li><li>Pull-back motor!</li><li>Great minifigure!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>Stickers fall off easily.</li><li>Not much to play with.</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This was a satisfactory set. The very big problem was that with the years, the stickers fall off. I had to order new bricks to replace some bricks with some parts of old stickers on them.</p><p>If you really want this set, think twice. And if you do buy it, and you want to keep it out for the next 5 years or so, then don't glue on the stickers!</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
