Probably because my thrifty mom earned me about 3 of each through this Promo. I still have the unmistakable parts floating through around Lego my bins after all these years, and they're still as useful.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Free Lego sets!<br></li><li>Simple sets, good parts<br></li><li>Great for beginners just starting with Lego</li><li>Good for play time, since they come with mini figures and moving parts<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li><br>Not many parts to work with, leaving limited re-build options as stand-alone sets</li><li>Simplicity and few parts might leave the experienced Lego builder uninterested<br></li></ul><br>
<p>Let's just hope Kellogg's (or someone) has a deal this good again in the future!<br></p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,5
