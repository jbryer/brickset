"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-09T20:31:21Z","I'm back!","Great set! If you've ever wondered why I rate everything so good is, if I didn't like the set, i wouldn't buy it! The pit crew guy with a trolley/jack thing is easy to put under the car! Just slide the jack under the front spoiler thing. Here are the mini-figs: Pit crew guy with a fire extinguisher, pit crew guy with a wrench, pit crew guy with a BRAKE sign, pit crew guy with a jack, and two, (2) pit crew guys that are genaric. There is also a car driver. (generic). There are two, again, (2) grease dispensers at the top. Oh, and closing out, if you put the gas hose on the ground instead of the little gas, can unit thingy, it works much better.  The other way would not bend in the shown position. In closing, Hobo J.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-07T07:59:29Z","Lots of minifigs and stickers.","This is a great little set - it will certainly be hard to beat for minifigs although helemets have no visors for pit crew only for driver. Also have a tendancy to twist round easily when handling/positioning them. Positioning the jack under the front of the car to raise it and keeping the guys feet on the ground at the same time like on the box takes a little patience, but it can be done. Car looks good (but not as good as 1:24 version, but seems more in scale with minifigs) as does the pits. Instructions contain an alternative design for the pits and track so it can be made up differently if you like and it adds to the interest if you want more than one. Stickers for both no. 1 and 2 cars are included. Have slightly modified front spoiler by adding wings to the ends like the slightly larger 1:24 version which I made at the same time. Lots of stickers to apply both to car and minifigs, and although i prefer printed, it is personal choice.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-25T16:32:11Z","Good set!","like the title says a good set.

PROS:
1)F1 car has no pull back motor
2)Six minifigs, plus the driver minifig
3)Lots of tools
4)Four extra tires 

CONS:
1)Stickers

so over all a good set, but could have had printed pieces instead of stickers",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-01T10:38:00Z","Great Minifig Set...","The 7 minifigs look more like ninjas or (pre)-spideys
than racers... ;)
I love the little &quot;details&quot; that make this set cute.
I don't care too much for the stickers or for dark stone 
&quot;pit&quot; base... wish these plates were in a different color
like green or light grey

"Alemas","2009-05-29T16:34:51.14Z","This is my longest review so far!","This time, I'll make a more detailed review! Let's start with the car: It's a simpler version of the Ferrari Racer. The driver is general, with no name on the torso sticker.
Now, to the pits itself: It's just a wall with accesories on it and two poles for the wheel guns. The pits has a ""tool-box"" and what looks like a telemetry computer.
The pit men all have the same face, torso sticker, and legs. Here's a list of them:

Wheel-jack operator
Wheel man
Lolli-pop man
Fuel man
Fire-extinguisher man
Man with a wheel, presumably giving it to the wheel man

To wrap it up, here are the pros and cons:

Pros for the car:

Detailed, considering it's a down-scaled version of the Ferrari Racer

Cons for the car:

General-looking driver


Pros for the pits:

Lots of accesories
Lot of minifigs
Tool-box
Telemetry computer
Great baseplate

Cons for the pits:

None!

Overall, a great set with lots of accesories and a good-looking car!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
