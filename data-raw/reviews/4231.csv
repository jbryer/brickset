If so, maybe it's a bit of LEGO history).<br><br>EDIT: The LEGO digital blue electronics (like the alarm clock) are sold at RadioShack. However, I've yet to see another SET there.<br><br>I was about to rate ""Parts"" 4 stars, but decided on 5 only because of the wheels. Besides the four monster truck wheels, you get two smooth, (plastic only) wheels to do donuts.<br><br>The car was under constant use, and died quickly. Luckliy, I got it on clearance, and had fun with it while it lasted.<br><br>Bottom line: Worth it for the wheels---just know that if you want a more rugged, long-lasting RC car, get one that isn't LEGO. While they make great bricks, they don't make great motors.<br>",TRUE,3,5,4,3,2
