Best, if you have some paving or tarmac, to drive along that. I suggest that you use BOTH batteries Durracel, because that makes it work better! Also, there are three other cars to make with the same pieces! Unfortunately, you need to take the car that you buid first, apart.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-10T14:16:52Z","Great RC!","   I love this RC very much. The colors are right, the speed and armor is just what I wanted! I would give it a 9.9 if I could, because it has hardly, if not any, suspension. I'd give this a 10 if not for that. I also like the new pieces it comes with. A really cool thing is that the holes fit regular Lego brick studs and technic pieces. If you want to make Lego cars you control, this set is for you. I love it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

But before that happened it had good control and speed and the battery lasted a fairly long time. Unfortunately it isn't excactly lego which is a downside. As an ending thought to this review, Lego should make minifigure RC cars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
