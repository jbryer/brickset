If there is a problem with this, it is only that it is barely enough for a very small house. There is certainly a need for many more pieces for any serious house design, of course one could simply buy more boxes but it may be disappointed to notice at home that the pieces are not as many as they looked in the first place.

Otherwise the selection of pieces is very good, there are no pieces longer than 4 studs, and there are enough tops, double-convexes and double-concaves. It makes perfect sense that all pieces are of the same color.

We need a lot of this type of brick sets for house contruction (not just for roof pieces, but also windows, doors, fences, etc.), but for some reason their production is always very limited. It would be nice to have these sort of boxes always available, and in many different colors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

We could probably have done with two sets, as while the variety of different-size bricks was very welcome, we did struggle in having enough bricks for a decent roof.</p>

<p>The variety is very good, with a range of widths from one- to four-stud, and a selection of corner bricks too, along with a few apex bricks. This set probably works best to supplement an existing haul of roofing bricks, but as we had so few to begin with, competition for these bricks was fierce. But maybe that&#39;s a sign that Lego knew what they were doing when they released these supplementary sets.</p>
