It was either the fact that there was too many stickers or the set was too big for me to build by myself, but now I build sets on my own all the time, even ones with stickers. Whoops, sorry, here are the goods and bads:

Good:
Pullback Motor
Great Red pieces
Red-a good color
Non-sticker picture pieces
Medium-sized wheels
Good size

Bad:
Nothing

Overall:
5/5
