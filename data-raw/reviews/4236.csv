It looks really cool and it has some nice valuable pieces which are printed. In fact: We get no stickers in this set. We also don't get any minifigs with this car. But I love the play feature where you move the car back with the pull-back-engine which allows you to launch the car better. It drives very fast and it looks very fast as well. I'm really glad to have it - even if it doesn't have many play features. It's a great set for little money and a great starter set for the young kids for sure. It's also a great seet if you want to get some nice pieces for future MOC's (My own creations) or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
