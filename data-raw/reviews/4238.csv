The model car features a pull-back motor which is powerful, making the car quite fast.  The fat tires allow it to work well on carpet or jump over small obstacles.  They also protrude out in front of the car, causing it to bump off of things (e.g. walls) with no damage, often turning around in the process.

The car is quite rugged; the only weak part are the decorative fins on the back.  We removed those after a couple of days of play, and now the thing is nearly indestructible, standing up admirably to the rough play of a four-year-old (and his dad).  It doesn't feel like a LEGO model, it's so solid â€” and yet it is, almost entirely standard LEGO parts that will gave a great many uses in other models when we finally take the car apart.

This model also does an interesting trick: you can start it out in a wheelie position, and it will travel that way for a meter or two before tipping back down onto all four wheels.


All in all it's a great set that makes a great toy car.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
