"bmwlego","2007-12-30T13:08:46.733Z","Track Blaster","What a great promo set! This could have been included in a larger set as part of a racing set. The minifig's clothes are all white which looks great. A hinge brick, printed slope, set of small wheels and set of large wheels, and a steering wheel are all specialty parts included with this set. The main model is near perfect and truly looks like a set that could have been sold in stores. The alternate models are ok, not great. They are a weird plane, incomplete looking car and a farm tractor. Overall,, not a bad set at all, especially when you consider that it is an inexpensive promo set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brixton","2009-09-03T19:57:52.78Z","Off roader","This set comes with a very interesting and unique piece that the entire race car is built around.  I haven't seen anything like it in any set since.  It looks more like an off road vehicle than a race car but it's still a great set to have.  I think the minifigures ""clothing"" is a bit too plain.  The all white doesn't work for me.  Maybe have a zipper going up the middle and the name of the racing team across the front.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"stitchfan","2011-04-17T22:34:34.703Z","The first one is always free...","<p>Possibly the best Kellogg's promotions ever, Sets 1560, 1561, 1562, and 1563 were the sets I remember most vividly as a kid. Probably because my thrifty mom earned me about 3 of each through this Promo. I still have the unmistakable parts floating through around Lego my bins after all these years, and they're still as useful.<br>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Free Lego sets!<br>
</li><li>Simple sets, good parts<br>
</li><li>Great for beginners just starting with Lego</li><li>Good for play time, since they come with mini figures and moving parts<br>
</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li><br>
Not many parts to work with, leaving limited re-build options as stand-alone sets</li><li>Simplicity and few parts might leave the experienced Lego builder uninterested<br>
</li></ul><br>

Let's just hope Kellogg's (or someone) has a deal this good again in the future!",TRUE,3,3,1,4,5
