"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-07T04:00:45Z","Great display piece","Looks better than 8461 and 8458. The wheels were always too low and wide on those and the front was too long and flat. This is a much better design. A pitty though that the front and rear wheels are the same size, but of course it makes the wheels more useful for other purposes.
Technically this model is not very interesting, it only has steering and a V10. The motor cover is removeable, but doesn't open with pneumatics like 8461/8458, but that was also an odd functionality! There is no suspension.
Partswise this is a good set, with lots of useful stuff if you are into New-style Technic building. The wheels are sofar exclusive for this set and are actually very nice on both sides.
Price point is fair and this set really doesn't do anything wrong. I just don't think it will ever be considered a classic set and the mild disappointment over the lack of functionality keeps me away from the top ratings. I rate this set as about average for a Technic set of this size. A nice price and some nice parts helps it a bit, so my overall rating ends on a 70.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-09T20:52:02Z","Very nice set for Technic fan","I bought this set as soon as it was available in North America and I don't regret it. The look is great and I don't know why some people wrote comments about this model not being a 1:10 scale F1, it is!!! It is 18.5&quot; long. The wheels are 66mm high, those of a current F1, 660mm. On the technical side, only steering and a V10. Suspension would have been difficult but I am building a sister F1 and so far, I have fit a front suspension. If you love F1 and Technic set, get one!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T01:43:56Z","this is so awesome!","i just bought this set and it took me a little over two and a half hours to build ( because i was playing with it). this is the best set i have ever had.the decals are perfectly placed, the motor is awesome( i wished they used gray instead of that clear plastic thow), and the spider gear differental is the coolest lego thing i have ever seen. it really suprised me! the only bad side is the stearing. it is sorta stiff (but easy to modify). if you have $70 to blow then this would be perfect.+ the tires are great!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-04T09:46:15Z","HM...","I have to agree with Martin on this one. Nice little set, but it lacks the functionality and complexity of its two bigger brothers, the Williams and the Silver Champion. I won't go so far as to call it dissapointing in comparison to the 8461/8458 sets, because the price was a fair indicator of this set being rather simple (EURO 79,99). (The Silver Champion was pretty overpriced, especially here in Europe, but had to have it anyway, same as the Williams)
The front steering/&quot;suspension&quot; is a bit crude, and I removed the grey &quot;washer&quot; from the secondary steering solution, because in the end I kept holding the black connector thingy in my hand... All in all a 7/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-15T18:54:04Z","Nice set","For starters, don't compare this to the silver champ or the williams. This set does not have susspension or air-dampend-spring lifting rear canopy.
It is shorter, narrower and has smaller wheels so is of different scale.

It does have a v12, and the rear canopy can be removed.
As far as studdles chassis go, this is more structureally sound than the backhoe. I was surprised by the strength of the chassis. 
The biggest surprise is building it which is why i rate it so high.
You build this set like no other lego vehicle.
you build the nose first,then the cockpit,then the engine, then the tail.
This is the only set i have seen where you don't build the entire chassis first.
Some nice tricks employed to make many peices conform to the odd numbered width of the vehicle, a few new bits thrown in combined with serious potential to modify, makes this a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-30T02:28:59Z","Just right for the price","This set is a very good set, considering the price. Of course, it dosen't have more of the technical elements that the Silver Champion/ Williams racer have, but neither does it have thier price tag. I felt this was a medium challenge to build, but I still had a lot of fun. I too, enjoied the uniqueness of the chassis build in modules. very different from other sets. I will state, though, that the tires are NOT unique to this set, as stated in another post. You can acquire these same tires in the R/C set Hot Flame. This was a Radio Shack exclusive in 2003, I believe. any Ferrari fan MUST have this set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-28T11:55:16Z","Not much functional","A bit disappointment! Other than steering and piston engine model not much fun. Earlier racing car models like silver champions or Williams were far better. A gear and suspension would have made it excellent.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T17:33:05Z","Amazing!!!","I got this for around &#163;35. As others before me have stated it is just right for the price you pay. It might not have the functions of the older bigger race cars such as the 8458 Silver Champion and the 8461 Williams BMW F1 but it looks outstanding!

It features functional steering which works pretty well. It also features a removable engine cover. The steering can be controlled from two different places. Control from either in the cockpit if you can get your hand in the there or use the black axle extender which can be seen where the driver would sit.

It is a minor challenge to build, shouldn't take too long and is well worth the end result. The old Technic beams are completely obsolete in this set. Amazingly the chassis is just as strong. The cowling works brilliantly and provides the essential curves a Formula 1 car so desperately needs, beams could never provide this.

True to scale it is 1:10 and features all relevant 2004 sponsor decals. The decals are by far the best thing in this set and they definitely light up the car and make it an excellent display item to make others jealous with.

I for one am really glad Lego ventured into the world of Formula 1 and I hope they create many more F1 Racers preferably a car from each team of the same size. The only downside is that it could have been the same size as the Williams and had the same functions (suspension, pop-up engine hood and generally larger size). The noticeably larger size of the Williams racer would make this car look odd next to it, however once I get my Williams F1 I will review that set and compare it to this one.

This set really is a must have! It looks amazing and I am honoured to possess one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-03-02T22:58:59.81Z","Not quite a supercar","I just picked this up off ebay for an incredible $20, including shipping, and I couldn't be happier.  I don't think I would have paid Lego's original asking price, though.  It's a cool set, but I don't know if it's $70 worth of cool.  

Paying original price, this set comes in at just under ten cents per piece.  I don't know why the Ferrari sets are so ridiculously expensive (licensing costs, maybe?), but they all seem to be a little pricier than comparably sized sets.  Personally, I wish Lego would get off this Ferrari kick--they're cool cars, sure, but there are lots of cool cars out there.  And speaking of cars, when is Lego gonna stop with the firetruck/construction/farm equipment junk and release another supercar (or truck)?!  Ah, but I digress...

I really like this set.  It's got good parts (16 fairing panels!  Loads of liftarms!  V10!  Great for the aspiring supercar designer.) and is of reasonably good size (18.5 inches/47cm).  The tires are the same size as those seen in the two &quot;Nitro&quot; models, 8649 and 8682.  While the suspension doesn't &quot;work,&quot; it does look the part of an F1 suspesion.  It has a rear differential, removable engine cover, and (huzzah) the steering wheel is linked not only to a hand-of-god device in the cockpit, but also to the steering wheel.  I personally can't stand it when Lego doesn't even bother to connect the steering wheel, but then I guess it gives us all something to do after we're finished with the model, doesn't it?  It does, of course, have the bane of every Lego fan's existence:  multi-brick stickers.  But this being a racing car with huge sponsor logos everywhere I don't see any way around that.  

Overall, a very nice-looking, aesthetically pleasing model with good, standard features.  And with the 1:8 model out, you can pick up a used one on the cheap.  This car is perfect to hold over those who love technic cars and want a decent build but can't see forking over $100 or $140 (enzo and 1:8 F1) for a &quot;super&quot;car without so much as a transmission, at least until the next REAL supercar comes out.

"Monty","2006-01-16T08:26:52Z","Cheaper Precursor","Having just made my first Technics set – Ferrari Enzo 8653 a couple of weeks ago and loved it, I am now undoubtedly hooked on this genre. Consequently I decided I wanted to get this set. After looking unsuccessfully for about a week, I decided it was becoming scarce (there is a good reason, which I will reveal), but I luckily found one (they actually had two) for 35 GBP in a closing down sale.

I enjoyed the lengthy build and continued with my admiration of the Technics designers - as you build, you seem to do odd things which at the time you wonder about, but somehow it all comes together successfully at the end, and you realise why you put that piece in a certain place 3 hours earlier. So long as I continued to be inspired by these clever designs, I am likely to remain hooked.

The set has already been extensively reviewed, but I do like the see – thru working V10 engine, and the fact that the steering mechanism is connected to the wheel – unlike the Enzo. This set necessarily has lots of stickers which went on pretty well - the worst thing for me was putting the tiny stickers on the wheels – 3 on each and very fiddly to get into the right place. 

I notice many of the reviewers state it is not as good as the previous larger Technics F1 cars, 8461/8458, but I agree with those who say that for the price it is difficult to fault the set for that. However, the reason it is becoming scarce is that it is to be REPLACED THIS YEAR WITH A LARGER 1:8 SCALE F1 FERRARI – which hopefully will have all the detail of those previous sets so no one will be disappointed – personally I can’t wait. 

As I am still in a state of childlike wonder with Technics sets I can forgive any so called shortcomings, especially for the price I paid, so it has to rate a maximum score.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-25T12:44:39.653Z","That engine is a monster!","This is the first Technic scale representation of the real deal, and I say, it looks pretty darn good. In my opinion, one major detail missing, but the other existing features compensate for that.

Pros:

-Overall design is realistic and detailed
-There is a monster V-10 engine that has working pistons, with pipes and a radiator adjacent to either side of the engine block
-Sleek plating
-Steering system is pretty cool and fun to play around with
-Cockpit is nice, has a steering wheel. The wheels will turn if you turn the steering column or the black lever in the centre of the cockpit
-You can take off the top plating to see the engine more clearly
-Wheels are cool

Cons:

-The biggest thing missing is suspension
-Top plating concealing engine is difficult to put back on because the tight space where the bushes are used to secure the plating is hard to access

Overall great model, but I recommend the later version which does have suspension.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
