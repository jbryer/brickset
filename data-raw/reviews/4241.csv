"davy_jones","2009-10-02T07:13:16.14Z","Child of passion"," This set is definately one for the Tifosi. Absolutely clever marketing technique by Lego To capture one of the most glorious moments in the Prancing Horse's racing history.
 Get this set if you're a huge Ferrari fan and already have an expanding Ferrari series in the Creator collection. It even has a large holy grail...errr trophy! But I'll have to be honest and say that there almost nil playability with other sets. When it comes to a piece for mantle adornment however, it can hardly be beaten.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-30T12:00:57.037Z","LEGO Racers (Ferrari) - M. Schumacher and R. Barrichello Review","This set is my only set with the Formula 1 drivers Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. I'm a huge fan of the Formula 1 and my favourite driver is Schumacher. The details on Schumacher's and Barrichello's face are really good. Also the details on the overalls and their helmets.<br><br>The trophy is a cool piece to have but it's a little bit too big for the minifig. What I don't like about this set is that the torso of the minifigs have stickers. If you're a Formula 1 fan I would recommend you to get this set - even if this set has no play features. The minifigs are a great addition to your LEGO collection and to the LEGO Racers (Ferrari) theme. And I also hope that LEGO is going to do a F1 theme with all teams, drivers and tracks since 1950 of course.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"modena","2011-02-06T11:47:49.873Z","This set really receives a trophy! (Oh, it's got one.)","<p>I got this set a while ago, but I still play with it in our vacation house!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Trophy!</li><li>Has&nbsp;two&nbsp;great stars of F1!</li><li>Flags and a stage!</li><li>Minifigs can either wear caps or helmets!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Helmets, but where's the cars!</li><li>Ehm... 6 years later, the stickers fall off!</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>This was a great set, and it is still fully preserved. The parts in this set shine (like the trophy) and the&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;aren't as bad either. The only things that bother me is that this set doesn't have a car. Why does this set then need a pair of&nbsp;helmets? Kind of silly. The stage with the flags seems very nice, and I still use it for stop-motion. (I use the whole set!) The stickers will fall off, but maybe they look better without.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, get it, but make sure you have some cars to race with!</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,3
