"Paski","2010-03-15T16:17:28.577Z","Essential for building houses","<p>This old supplementary set is probably the most intensively used supplementary set I have. It consists of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>26x Slope Brick 33 3x4 <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>8x Slope Brick 33 3x2 <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>6x Slope Brick 33 2x4 Double <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>2x Slope Brick 33 2x2 Double <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic building sets from that time, like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=515-1"">515</a> and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=520-2"">520</a>, came with a few roof pieces, but there were never enough to build an entire roof of a house. I could always build the walls, but I did not have the pieces to build the roof. After I got this set, I could finally do that. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts selection is great and well-balanced. To build a more serious sized house you will probably need 3 of 4 of these sets though.</p>
<p>I know this is not a model, but these type of sets really stimulated my creativity as a child - and provided the most fun, actually. I would highly recommend parents to get these type of sets for their children.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A set of pieces you usually don't have enough from</li>
    <li>Balanced parts selection</li>
    <li>Stimulates creativity</li>
</ul>
<p>cons:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>You probably need more than 1 copy<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
