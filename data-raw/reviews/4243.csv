It is too small for whatever you want to use it for, but it is the most grassy colour in lego history. I am not sure what lego intended for us to use it for, but I don’t think they were quite with it at the moment. 

I got this set with everything else as a bulk lot, and I wouldn’t have bought it myself. For those who want this set, I suggest the X-large baseplate, but if you want something grassy then this will have to do. If it is the biggest green baseplate you can find, then you would probably have to get a lot of them, but it is really not worth the money. 

If you want this to make a grassy scene for a brickfilm, I suggest you use actual grass, and if you need studs then stick this in the middle of a load of grass. If you want this set for whatever reason you have to find a better one, a bigger one. Use this as a last resort, because it is not worthwhile.

Really I think that this is only useful setting a small scene of nothing. Grass comes in useful once in a while but really it is not a good set. You can get baseplates with rivers rinning through them, this is probably better because you can just add a river anyway, you have lego bricks! This goes for lego sets with roads also. I think that there are large sandy baseplates as well that suits for underwater and really only you would know what you want to buy this for and whether it is a good buy or not. 

Let’s face it, 32 by 32 is way too small. The X-Large grey baseplate may be a tad small as well. But, if you get a lot of them grouped together, then it makes it seem a bit bigger. Though, as I said, in reality, one costs you a bit. Two costs too much, though. Four costs you way too much and eight is too big a figure. Buy one of these sets, if at all. If you need any more please use actual grass, and if you haven’t got any then I suppose you can buy another of this. Just remember I do not recommend it. 

Overall this is not worth buying and if you find it at a lowish price then you may buy it. Really I suggest that you find something better, but I suppose that there are worse sets out there, and this one I found hard to review because it is pretty boring and has no importance in my lego collection. Also I do not like it, would rather have another grey X-large baseplate. Really only you know whether it is a good deal or not, everything is there and if you expect more out of it then you will not be amused. This is a good spare baseplate because for me it’s life purpose in my collection is to sit around doing nothing at all. Do not buy this set unless it is absolutely necessary, trust it from me, this is a waste of money, even to lego’s standards.

"Exo_brick","2009-03-11T16:18:03.06Z","Decent","As a city builder, all of the baseplates are 32x32, so this is great, made all the better by it's green color. I made a park out of it. The Extra Large is more useful but has a bad color for anthing more than a moon base or parking lot (and battles). They are both useful. The price tag of 10 smackers is too high. at most, 5. This is good, but a green Extra Large would be a 5, no matter the price. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros: 

Can be used for parks or  non-urban places.
Is large enough to put most buildings on.

Cons:

none
