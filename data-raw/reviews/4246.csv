I like this tilt-rotor helicopter more and more each time I build it.  It's uncomplicated and looks realistic when completed.  The 8412 doesn't have very many pieces (parts count is less than 300), but it gives the impression of being a mid-size kit.  I especially like the flexible cables.  (I think the 8412 is the reason why I've never gotten around to building my unopened still-in-the-box 8444.)  Good job.  9.5/10.  15 April 2004",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The problem with it is that the flex cables are too fragile (don't think any of mine is still intact) and the rotors tended to become stiff after some time, but still... :)
The secondary model isn't as good, however. Only has one function: movable flaps.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
