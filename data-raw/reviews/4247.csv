The steering was poor and kept felling apart during play. The older rack and pinion system is much more solid and reliable.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2008-12-24T19:30:39.467Z","Yes, a Good Set!"," This is a good set with obviously a creative design. It really looks like something that belongs on Mars! The tracks provide excellent traction, and the steering is pretty good. The yellow also works well in this set, and makes it look simply amazing. I think this could probably even work with Power Functions, allowing for even more fun. Seriously, this is one that looks like it could have been a classic if it got a little more attention.
