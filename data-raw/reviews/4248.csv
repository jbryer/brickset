What a surprise, so many &quot;new style&quot; Technic pieces -- it was nice to see some old friends like the chain drive and 24-tooth gear! Anyway, I'm glad to be back in the Lego world. The 8417 was a nice introduction to the newer pieces and is a lot of fun overall. I prefer the chopper alternate model, but both models are pretty cool.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

 I have also made another model out of spare parts, but left the fairing off (a streetfighter in real terms) with a pair of spotlights on the front and a extra silencer on the other side, not made the alternative model but it looks quite good for a chopper.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MetroiD","2010-05-09T19:28:34.59Z","Great Technic set - at least the alternative design is!","<p>I've never been big on Technic - I own just about enough Technic sets whose parts I utilize as greebles in my MOCs and I'm more than happy that I've found some kind of purpose for all those Technic-y pieces. The one set that had been left intact for quite a long time and was recently rebuilt, however, is precisely the Mag Master.</p>
<p>It was one of the very last sets I received before my dark ages set in, and pretty much the only one which survived throughout those long years without being packed in a box and stowed away. The reason is quite simple - I absolutely love motorcycles.</p>
<p>Back in the days, I used to be fascinated by choppers so naturally, I didn't even consider building the primary model - instead, I went straight for the alternative one. I was so impressed I never even considered trying to use the instructions and build the original &quot;Master&quot;. A few months ago, I had the notion to finally give it a shot (seeing as my focus has shifted and I'm more of a sportsbike person nowadays, I guess) - I ended up regretting it. The A model (i.e. the sportsbike) looks _very_ unfinished, and the missing fairings are not the only reason for that. While the rear swingarm + suspension were both definitely very nice touches, looking at the complete model I couldn't help the feeling I was staring at a bike that had been in a bad crash.<br />
<br />
Typical of people who just don't &quot;get&quot; Technic, you might say. But I wonder then how you could explain the fact that I don't see anything unfinished in the chopper model. Well, I guess at the end of the day it's all a matter of personal opinion, but the good thing is - whether you're a sportsbike fan, a chopper lover or a Technic MOCcer, you'll definitely enjoy this one.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
