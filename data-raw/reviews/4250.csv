It has realistic suspension on both wheels, V2 engine chain driven with rear wheels - as in real motor cycle. There are few other goodies, like instrument panel, front &amp; rear lights including indicators and number plate. It even has a parking stand. However, the joint between front &amp; rear part could have been stronger and turning radius should be tighter.

Anyway, this is a great model and best among Lego motorcycles and fun to play with.
The alternate model, a dragstar, is useless though IMHO.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
