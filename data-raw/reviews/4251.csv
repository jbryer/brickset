"Matthias_K","2016-05-31T01:43:04.6Z","No black sheep, but no high-flyer either","<p>I never saw this set growing up, so therefore I&nbsp;was not clouded by nostalgia when I bought this because of my&nbsp;soft spot for Technic&nbsp;planes. What I found was a nice&nbsp;airplane&nbsp;(although smaller than I imagined it to be)&nbsp;and an absolutely&nbsp;terrible B-model.</p>

<p>The build was interesting, because the standard plane functions were done a little differently than normal. For instance, the ailerons are controlled by turning a knob instead of the usual joystick method. I especially like how the flaps and the landing gear were linked to each other.</p>

<p>Once built, the plane looks pretty good. Especially when the landing gear is up. I don&#39;t judge the playability too harshly, but controlling the functions on this plane while holding it&nbsp;doesn&#39;t&nbsp;work that well (especially&nbsp;the propellers). I do admire how many functions they managed to cram in a limited space with a limited amount of parts.</p>

<p>Building the B-model (speedboat)&nbsp;wasn&#39;t nearly as fun. A few steps were even&nbsp;downright annoying. The model also doesn&#39;t make it worth your while as it doesn&#39;t particularly look good, feels very flimsy and&nbsp;the &#39;functions&#39; almost&nbsp;don&#39;t&nbsp;work at all. I was very&nbsp;disappointed in this B-model&nbsp;and it drags my score for this set&nbsp;down a bit.</p>
