"A_Brickset_user","2003-04-30T00:00:00Z","","This was my first LARGE technic set. This set is great. Lots of great features. Steering, pumping pistions, shocks, and a whole bunch of other features. The CD-Rom is good too. A chasing game to unlock bulding instructions for the alternitive moadels. It also has a showcase of the other technic sets that were out durring the time and it shows how those sets work. Very Nice!!!!!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set Itself Has A Lengthy Build, And Can be Compicated.

Very Good Set, And If You See 1, Pick It Up!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

One problem I had was with the buggy.  This is, in my view, the better looking model, but the 1x4 plate that keeps the bottom part of the engine fixed in is constantly being pushed off when the suspension goes down.  It was dissapointing that you have to work right the way through the game on the CD to get any of the bonus instructions.  The CD also messed up my brother's computer so I have not used it again since.  It is rather annoying to have to sit in front of the computer to make a model as the surface is usually cluttered and might become a burial ground for small pieces.  This set resists the temptation, that seems to be irresistable for LEGO in modern sets, to use loads of decoration pieces to disguise a distinct lack of substance on the model.  None of the pieces in this set are specifically meant for one purpose therefore making it acceptable for LEGO purists.  At an average pace it takes about 5 hours to make and is worth the effort.  Though there are the above complaints, the vast majority of the set's contents encourage positive feedback.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It also works like a real car with the moving engine and the working stearing wheel,plus the suspention! It also can change from off-road to street car and has other models but it is a bit expensive.... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

First of all is the rear suspension which has two settings, there's the cool looking, sleek low-rider, then at the flick of a switch you get a more agressive looking street fighter. Also, the 'hand of god' steering is connected to the steering wheel in the cockpit. Add all that to a very cool, futuristic colour scheme and the lowest profile wheels&nbsp;I think&nbsp;Lego ever made and you end up with a very nice package. Yet another bonus you may be unaware of is that the car fits perfectly with set 8462,&nbsp;it's as if they were made for each other, fancy that!!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
