Nice set, I'm grateful that they did re-release this one. Yellow suits it well and it is despite it being smaller than I expected a very playable model. It has nice clever features, particularly the steering and axle supports but I was somewhat disappointed by the slightly jerky crane movement and the string for the hook needs persuading to lower but along with the back hoe digger this rates as one of the best technic releases releases of the last few years.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-08T20:03:19Z","Nice set, but needs some work.","Gonna go with a 6 max.  The 4 wheel steering is great, but this set could use some mods to make it a wee bit better.
1. Bigger stabilizers
2. The extending boom needs some sort of hold down when it is extended to prevent the drive teeth from catching on the drive mechanism.
3. Just think what a couple of motors could do to this thing
a) Little red one to drive boom extension.
b) Geared to drive spool
c) Geared to drive turtable.

There's plenty of good ideas here though.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

My sister and my brother had already had LEGO products, so i grew up with it around. Then this set came around.. I asked and asked for it, circled/check it on every LEGO magazine i could. Finally it transformed my play experience to a whole new level. The gears, the axles, the ability to add power functions, 4/6 wheel steering... This set was my first teacher about mechanics, gear reduction, leverage. This will always be my favorite, also bonus it has a metal crane hook.</p>
