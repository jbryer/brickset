I stopped at a estate sale earlier today and found this set tucked under a bunch of board games. Although the box is a bit torn up, the contents looked good. I did a quick visual and figured it was close to being complete. And the two PC dics were there! I have yet to check them out. It also appears to have both booklets and ad sheets for future sets that were to be released as well as the membership form for the club...all for $4!</p>
<p>Pros</p>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, a great set I would have spent 10x's the money I did. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
