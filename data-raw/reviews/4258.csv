the helicopter can be removed from the trailer, the trailer can be removed from the truck. The propellers spin on the helicopter. 
The helicopter has two trans-red axel joints which i have not seen in any other technic set.
For the price it's a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T16:51:20Z","Cool Studless design","I just purchased it at LEGOLAND germany yesterday. It was rather cheap at 14,49â‚¬ and because of the whopping seven Models, that can be built fun for hours.
Now I'm rating the Models ranging from skill one to three:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Quick Builds:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Motorcycle:
It's a good little model, which has a working steering but also a ugly back. It's really great for only about 40 pieces. So it gets a solid 8/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Forklift Crane?:
This model has similarities to the Forklift Crane from the old 8064 set and the 10 year old 8062's one. But it's much smaller compared to these and looks slightly better than the old models of this sort, which takes it to another 8/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Dune Buggy:
I don't like this model. It's the smallest in terms of piece count, but has a working suspension that uses the rubber band coming with the set. But even this can't bring this model to something better than a 5/10, because it's lacking.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Experienced Build:
-----------------------------------------------------------
4. Mini Tipper:
This is a really nice design for it's smallness. And it has an steering ability and a tipping mechanism, which makes it rather functional. So I can give this a 9/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Trike:
I'm not very impressed with this model. It's basically slightly similar to the motorbike out of this set, but there's an additional function compared to the other bike. it has a rear suspension and the steering mechanism.
Altough it comes with 2 functions it's for me only a 7/10, because of some similarities to the other smaller motorbike.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Tipper Truck:
This is only a bigger version of the smaller one, but it hasn't a steering function. Ok it's small, but it would've been better with a function. The Tipping mechanism is more complex than in the smaller one. So it's an solid 8/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Advanced Build:
This is the main model of the set. it builds a nice truck with a trailer and a helicopter. So it recalls some memories from the old 5590 Model team set, but it's  much smaller, fully technic and fully studless. Well the truck is just a small design without a steering as in the 8441 Forklift, but that's just caused by the smallness. The trailer hasn't any features, but that doesn't matter for a trailer. The helicopter has working rotors, but there's no mechanism so you've to rotate them manually. And the two big bionicle pieces are good for making a rotor studless, altough these pieces seem a little bit ugly to me. 
All in all this is the best model of this set and get's a 10/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Overall: This is a nice technic set for everyone. It looks cool when the main model is assembled. The only thing, that I don't like are the extremely limited functions, but that's just the smallness of the models.
So it gets a 7,86/10 but rounded up to a solid 8/10. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-03T04:31:06.293Z","LEGO Technic - Cool Movers Review","This set may doesn't have lot's of play features but it comes with lot's of different models you can build with the pieces of this set. In fact: There're 7 vehicles you can build in total. I really like the truck of this model. The trailer can be removed and you can also remove the helicopter of this trailer. The blades of the helicopter are made of the swords of the LEGO BIONICLE figure Toa Kopaka from 2001. The build is really simple if you have experience on building LEGO Technic sets. The other 6 models are also very nice to build. It's a fun set to get for little money and I really can't complain about it. We also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
