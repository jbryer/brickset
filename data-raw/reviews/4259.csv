For the price, adjust your expectations.
Features include air-dampened-spring lowering landing gear. I couldn't figure out an easy way to reload it ?
the proppellors (which i believe are oversized) spin by hand and are not linked together.
The proppelors change pitch but the design of the engine mounting is poor and makes them wobble.
The instructions stumped me. The black peices are in the intructions as dark grey. the metalic grey peices are in the instructions as black. 
LEGO should print a colour key in the instructions for easier distinguishing between colours.

They are very sharp and are perfect for a V-22 Osprey type lego technic flyer!  This could be made into a utility plane, add some missiles and a gun to make it a military aircraft, add a camera of recorder for a recon runnner, add nothing and make it a night runner spy plane, or emove the props and make it a Star wars starfighter or frieghter! Indeed, this thing can be alot of things, so this is a very nice set to buy! If only lego made planes this good, however, I hate all technic sets but this is one I cannot deny, besides, I love airplanes and aviation!

"Dragon_fire","2008-04-04T11:07:56.95Z","A neat set","This set has many good and useful pieces and many really cool mechanisms. The fusealage is quite big, but the rotors are even bigger, something that cuts some of the realisticness of it (something I think Technic sets should be). It has a good solid build, which is excellent and all in all, the main model is a good model.
Now for the secondary model, the helicopter. While it is a lot smaller and has fewer mechanisms, it is just as good. Again it has a good solid build but is more realistic. The main bonus of the secondary model is because it is smaller, there are more spare parts so you can modify it. I managed to make weapons and make it an attack helicopter and I still had spare parts.
To sum up, this is an excellent set, if you see it, you should really get it, it has a good model and good parts, I highly recommend it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For me personally, the quality of a technic set can be measured by how many gears, LA&#39;s and pneumatic&nbsp;parts there are (hardly scientific I know, but as a rule of the thumb, it tends so work!). In this set, there&#39;s not an awful lot to get excited about - there&#39;s a shock absorber used to control the landing gear, which is pretty cool though.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was certainly enjoyable, being different from your standard &#39;truck&#39; affair you tend to get with technics. Not a complex build, and can comfortably be done in an evening</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Sadly, for me, the final model just didn&#39;t stack up for me. It feels a little like they&#39;ve tried to make as bigger plane possible with as few parts possible. The result is that it just looks unfinished - and is very flimsy - particularly with the &#39;engines&#39;. These can be rotated to allow &#39;vertical take off&#39;, but there is little rigidity to the mechanism, so as you&#39;re rotating them, they&#39;re just bouncing around all over the place. The engines themselves have been well thought out and looks good, but there is no connection to the rotors which would have been a simple addition, and would have brought some much needed complexity, and perhaps resulted in some additional&nbsp;rigidity&nbsp;to the engine / wing links too.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>By no means do I dislike this set - I really enjoyed building it, but it doesn&#39;t go in my hall of fame sadly. Didn&#39;t even bother to photograph this one before taking it apart again.</p>

By pressing the pneumatic extender, you pull the landing gear up. When you press the grey button on the top, the landing gear goes down! I never tried to add Power Functions, but I have worked out that you can fit some lights and a motor in each engine.</p><p>Overall, get this set straight away, and don't care about the con!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3
