"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-25T07:33:55Z","Nice looks, but not really exciting.","This set has many similarities with the 8858 Rebel Wrecker. It has almost the same technical functions and the alternative models are also the same.

The front suspension/steering system is very close to the one used in 8858. The only thing missing is the odd horisontal spring. The rear suspension is somewhat different. The rear axle is stiff and attached to the chassis in the midle, so it can swing like a pendulum-axle. There are no springs used in this construction, so it is not an independent suspension system. This un-sprung suspension has the advantage, that when towing a car, it doesn't &quot;sink&quot; and the suspension is still working perfectly.

The crane is fixed and cannot move. There is a winch in both ends of the vehicle and a V6-engine in the front. The drivetrain for the engine crosses the steering axle the same way as in 8858.

The engine hood can open, but since it is already just a frame, there's not much point in that. Lastly the whole body can easily be removed from the chassis almost like in 4404 Land Busters.

The set is a fun build and the result looks nice. All the technical functions work well.

If you already own the 8858 Rebel Wrecker, you can't help think, that this is a studless copy of the 8858, but if you are new to Technic, this set is well worth getting.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T20:35:18Z","Great set even though it doesn't have studs !","Excellent set.
Huge enjoyment to build. 
Great demonstration of what can be achieved without studs.
A few new pieces and modyfied old peices.
I can't think of too many ways to make this a better model.
The susspension needs special note: although there is indi springs in the front and a ridgid axel in the back, if there were any more springs, it would be too ridgid. The springs make it quite sloppy to drive which is fun.
The set includes a hightened level of detail such as the rear bumper lights are not only red. They are red (brake) and orange (indicator)!
The colour scheme is puzzeling ? the use of tan is unexplainable. The new greys are growing on me. But there is still the usual, blue axel pins, grey odd axels, black even axels which not only lets this set down, but every technical set being released of late.
Oh, and of the 700~ peices there are around 40 studs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"m1rec","2006-03-27T08:41:30Z","Great set","I bought this set on sale for 29 EUR (763 pieces). For this price is a must to have. The 4WD is really nice model. But, then I found this MOD model http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=148561 and I stopped on it. I think it is even better model then 2 original instructions. 
Summary: Had this set for 29 EUR and THREE instructions of great totally different model = SUPERB",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hga09","2011-02-07T01:52:20.893Z","Much underrated Technic truck","<p>This set may not be at the same flagship level as the legendary Lego Technic trucks with crane functions such as the 8421, 8868, 8460, 8285 or 8258, but it can certainly hold its own against other midrange (600-800 parts) Technic trucks with crane function such as 8446, 8462 and 8273.</p><p><br></p><p>The construction of this model uses some unique techniques. As you work on the build, sub-assemblies come together in ingenious ways, including the last step where the completed blue outer shell fits on the chassis. In other reviews, there seem to be some complaints about the rear suspension. 8435 implements a driven pendular suspension system instead of providing yet another minor variation on the double wishbone 
implementation seen on many Technic models before itself. Like any other Lego suspension, the implementation on this model may not be perfect, but it does work and it is cool.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The stubby form factor is probably a result of trying to keep the part count (and cost) low enough while providing a 4x4 with large enough wheels. Yes, the model could be a little longer, but this would not add to the functionality or playability.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very interesting (and modular) build <br></li><li>Pendular rear suspension<br></li><li>Blue (too many red and yellow Technic trucks)</li><li>Playability is decent</li><li>Many useful parts<br></li><li>Looks ""cute""<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Form factor is a bit unrealistic<br></li><li>Somewhat hard to ""mocify""<br></li><li>May be hard to find in good used condition (and complete)<br></li></ul>
<p>This set can still be found at a slight premium over the original retail price new, or below the original retail price in used condition. If you are into Technic vehicles, and if you can find a decent used one at a good price, 8435 is definitely worth a try.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
"TechnicNick","2011-12-21T19:33:53.683Z","It Isn't 4WD But It Is Nice.","There's a lot to like about this. A compact model with an impressive array of functions that follows the path set by the charming 8846.<div><br></div><div>And you can't go wrong with blue.</div><div><br></div><div>Building it is very pleasurable and I agree with those who admire it's modularity (is that a word ?), particularly that of the complete body which clips into place at the end.</div><div><br></div><div>For a smallish model to have engine, steering, suspension, working winches and so on is impressive, but there are compromises. I'm not a fan of the unsprung pendular rear end, but the front end is well resolved and those harder yellow shocks seem about right for this. Hand of God steering is good to have but I wish they'd connect the in-cab steering wheel as well...&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My biggest beef with this is the name. It's NOT 4WD. Nothing wrong with that, just tell it like it is, Lego!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, I like this. There's enough going on here to satisfy the seasoned Technic builder for a modest cost and the end result is very pleasing.</div>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
