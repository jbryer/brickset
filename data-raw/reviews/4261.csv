"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-04T18:13:20Z","Awesome Studless Technic","First I'd like to start exclaiming that the rifraf of what it's going to look like is none other than the model you see which is the main truck while the others are simply alternate. I own this model(got it in a special way)and is nice. The V-6 is a nice touch with rear wheel drivingn but the motors are grey components. The cab can be lifted to reveal the engine. 2 pneaumatic pumps run the crane with the air pump locate on the right side below the the turtable. I can tell ya, even if you dont like the new studless sets or chassis span construction this set is absolutely great! :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-05T02:18:12Z","Absolutely fabulous - well almost!","The truck has a stylish and aggressive look to it, but its features are standard, suspension on this would be great. The chassis should have been made with old style beams-with-studs. If the patent ran out, I haven't seen them being used by other building-bricks manufacturers?!

The cab can open and is completely separate from the chassis, except for the hinges. When it's open, this design probably looks good on a &quot;Lego town&quot; model, but looks dumb on a technic model of this level, (the silver champion 8458 alternative model truck has steering at the steering wheel, not the top of the cab, so to open the cab, the steering design had to be more complex than here, as well as having hydraulics to push the cab up)

The best design is the crane-with-a-hook, I don't know if it's based on a real life design, but it has an interesting mechanism.

The crane-with-a-claw and the car lift-and-tow mechanism (fits 8435) are also good, and each gives the truck a different look.

The colour scheme is very striking, and the new greys change shade depending on the lighting, the panels are the old bright red, the yellow lights look like a new shade of trans-yellow?!

There's plenty of standard parts and useful pieces for making other models, and I think it's gonna be really popular because it's so appealing, Lego might even start making a continuous line of trucks, like they did with their super cars. The end :)

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T12:59:26Z","Life-like Truck With Good Add-on Features.","This is among the 5 best sets i own. As a proffesional truck-driver myself I easily can recognice a number of features taken from real life. The first you build is the truck itself, and that alone is impressive, allthough suspension and transmission would not do any harm (yes I know it would make the model bigger and without doubt alot more expensive), but even without these features the model is very life-like.

Then you build one of three add-on features; a truck mounted crane, a car tow feature or a timber crane. The one i adore the most by far is the truck mounted crane. It was the first feature I build, and allthough I also tried the other two it is this feature the model stands with. The crane itself is as near reality as I think is possible.

One thing I miss about this model is the possibility to build a trailer to the model, but as a good Lego-fan I of course build one myself.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-16T13:46:23Z","cool design,  mean lego","why lego didn't just put independent suspension on this model?  it would make the set perfect... other than that, design is very cool and attractive, it really looks like a powerful road bull. if you want to buy it, go on, you won't regret.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lorddsp","2009-06-04T06:58:48.483Z","Excellent stuff","This truck is complet and very interesting.

I like so much pneumatic set and this one is one of the best.

Also, the red color is nice and it has a lot of functionnality.

The price is also ok for what it offers.

If you find one, buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Grogs","2011-03-19T11:08:06.993Z","Great set for the truck and pnumatics","<p>I found the set kind of weak (both&nbsp;psychically&nbsp;and build wise). &nbsp;I've never seen a truck that quite looked like that. &nbsp;But&nbsp;nonetheless&nbsp;she had a bunch of cool&nbsp;looking&nbsp;moving parts&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>If you take off the crane arms in the back I think the truck is very good looking, in addition, if you use the model where it is like a tow truck i think she looks more realistic</li><li>I was able to attach a compressor to the truck&nbsp;(but unfortunately the battery box had a hard tome staying on) but he had endless&nbsp;re playability&nbsp;that way (as all legos, but this set made modifying easy!)</li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Like i said a bit of an unrealistic truck</li><li>not an overly complicated&nbsp;base model</li><li>while the claw is the coolest, it certainly is unrealistic, the hook us also to be desired.</li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, good value for the price, and lots of&nbsp;modifying that can be done&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"talamcol","2021-12-27T20:43:20.14Z","Boring to build but nice parts","<p>I received this set as a gift in my childhood and rebuilt it lately as an adult. I could not remember anything from this truck. This is surprising since I have a lot of memories from other technic models of this time.</p>

<p>I suppose the main reason for this is how easy it is to build it. Every step of the instruction only contains a few parts hence you can basically build it without paying attention. Next, the model is a very small and besides the 3 different arms, it has no relevant features at all. Opening the driver cabin is almost impossible because the pins are too hard to remove while playing. The stearing is bad and it has no suspension.</p>

<p>To summarize, this is the most boring set I own but on the plus side, it provides a lot of nice parts to enhance other sets :)&nbsp;</p>
