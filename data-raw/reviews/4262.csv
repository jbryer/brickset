It has nearly same features as 8428/8432: moving pistons, back suspension,when you steer the hand of god steering steering  wheel in the cab turns. But it has only a V4 engine. It could be a V6. The steering with flex cables is intersting. The big off road tires are good. Plus it'a blue set. A set above the average. The alternate model is not good as the main model. I think it's an underrated set. If you can find it buy it. It will be a nice addition to any collection ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Features include â€“ V4 engine, rear wheel suspension, differential, steering, opening bonnet and doors. Tyres are big. However, transmission could have been simpler (lots of cogs to transmit power to wheels from engine). Main model can be motorized. This is my only blue set. Get this if you can find it cheap. Got mine for &#163;5 from Ebay!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
