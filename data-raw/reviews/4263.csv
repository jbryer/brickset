"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-24T06:17:23Z","Excellent set","8438 is a re-issue of 8460, the pneumatic crane truck. This set is simply wonderful. This is probably the last classic (with studded beams) set Lego released in 2003.

This may not be the best good looking technic model, but its functionality is superb. It resembles real crane truck in many ways. Its functionalities include – steering (it doesn’t matter which knob you turn), 360 degree movement turntable, stabilizers which raise the entire truck from ground using a wonderful worm wheel gear mechanism, pneumatic crane boom movement (raise or lower mimicking hydraulics in a real crane ), telescopic movement of crane arm using rack and pinion. There’s a hook on crane as of real crane. It comes with 3 technic seats as well. The steering on cab is dummy but that’s not big fault (it is very easy to make it right hand drive!)

The alternate mode, a pnuematic lorry, is also very good.

The set comes with 4 pneumatic cylinders and 2 switches.

"kendo73","2007-06-24T05:18:25.683Z","good set","Very good set, bought secondhand of ebay, built as the alternative model, the instuctions need careful observation as it is can be easy to miss some of the build.
The crane operation is smooth and reasonbly accurate, also the jacks are very good as they do lift the vehicle under the crane, could do with two more at the rear like the main model.
Will be looking out for another one so I can build as the main model.
The addition of extra cylinders are helpful for other projects.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"darkshadow79","2015-03-03T21:17:34.957Z","A great example of a mobile crane","<p>Having built the original release of this set from 1995 (#8460), I feel this is one of the finest more compact mobile cranes released by Lego. &nbsp;The build was very interesting as I was in my dark ages until about 2004, and although I felt it looked a bit &#39;boxy&#39; as I renewed my interest in Technic at the time studless construction was being used more and more in models. &nbsp;It took me until about 2011 to finally buy it, and got a very reasonable deal on a brand new, sealed set. &nbsp;Then I acquired its re-release (#8438) from 2003, with basically the exact the same parts, except for some parts that weren&#39;t in production any longer. &nbsp;So, without further ado, let me give my review on the set, and this really applies to the 8438, and its predecessors, the 8431 and the original 8460. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box, being somewhat weighty, gave an impression of a long, complicated build, which I tend to enjoy more than the smaller Technic sets. &nbsp;I received the yellow box version instead of the gray box version that was present with the 8431, and apparently according to Brickset&nbsp;some came in the gray box. &nbsp;The instructions are for the most part very clear, with exception of a couple hitches I ran into, mainly how the string runs around the pulleys and one end ties off at the end of the boom. &nbsp;Owning the 8421, 8053 and 42009 cranes, they use a simpler system of connecting the open end of the string, but after figuring out how to tie it off and how it runs around the pulley system, I was very pleased for the most part. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A plethora of studded and &#39;old-style&#39; parts, which the exception of different cranks for the functions, is basically the same as the original one. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know where the piece counts on the 3 different &#39;same&#39; models comes from. &nbsp;I have both the 8460 and 8438 cranes both built end to end on a table and neither look any different except for the exclusion of a handful of parts that had to be substituted in the 8438 due to most likely discontinuing very few parts, but they function exactly the same way. &nbsp;And as one reviewer pointed out, 3, yes 3 Technic seats. &nbsp;I believe the last set to have a Technic seat was the 8454 Airport Rescue Truck from 2003.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No Technic &#39;mini-figs&#39; in this set or its predecessors. &nbsp;Rather surprised me as the original 8460 came from an era when Technic was releasing a lot of smaller sets with Technic scale figs. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was great fun, and although you have to pay decent attention to the instructions as they aren&#39;t as straight-forward (or too easy) as modern-day sets, it was fairly simple to figure out. &nbsp;Some of the build was non-linear as in newer sets, which is a nice change, no repeat this step for the other side type building on many steps. &nbsp;Many times you complete 4 or 5 more steps before you switch to the other side and assemble that side. &nbsp;And many sub-assemblies got you thinking what is this going to do? &nbsp;And, with the exception of the more recent 42009 Mobile Crane, old school Technic had lots more gears than most any Technic set released since then.&nbsp;Being a great fan of pneumatics as opposed to the linear actuator cylinders that we&#39;re released in summer 2008, I enjoyed that part of the assembly, even if the back to back pneumatic cylinders we&#39;re plagued with same problem as 2005&#39;s 8421 Crane, where the boom would slowly sink overnight. &nbsp;I&#39;ve researched this issue, and been given 2 different opinions on that problem. &nbsp;One thing is make sure all tubing is tight on all connections, but even with that the heavy boom still seems to sink after a night or the next day. &nbsp;There are ways around it to keep the boom upright, but it requires adding parts that detract from the great looks of the crane. &nbsp;Oh, one more note, I love the stabilizers on the crane. &nbsp;For the first time a heavier crane can actually be totally lifted off the ground, I really liked that function. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great, very few stickers, but the yellow and black warning stickers on the rear of the crane superstructure give it a menacing look, like step back. &nbsp;It makes for a great playable crane, but also a great shelf model. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would recommend this crane to anybody who enjoys mobile cranes. &nbsp;I built my 8460 version a ways back, and upon building the 8438 it renewed my interest in the crane once again. &nbsp;You will not be disappointed, I can guarantee. &nbsp;There might be 1 or 2 new sets still floating around, depending on the country you live in and not having to shell out excess shipping or customs fees. &nbsp;If you do find one at a reasonable price, I wouldn&#39;t wait long before snapping either of the 3 releases up, there really is no difference at all between them. &nbsp;</p>
