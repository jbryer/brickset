"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-08T02:09:15Z","Simply Superb","I purchased this this set some time ago and it is truly superb. If you like a good model of the real thing in Lego this is probably as close as you can get. Front and rear traction, a 'real' engine and the steering wheel turns!!

In my opinion this is one of the best Lego models I've ever bought!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cderalow","2005-11-16T14:19:26Z","Nice set","On a similar scale to the 8455 Backhoe Loader, this pneumatic driven Front Loader has a quicker pneumatic system due to the addition of an air tank, which allows you to store up pressure more efficiently.  While its wheel and tire combo seem slightly small to me (they really should have been similar in size to the rear wheels on the 8455) the bucket seems to be in perfect scale.  Nowhere near as difficult to build as the 8455, this set took about 2 hours to construct.  It fits in wonderfully with other recent technic construction styled sets (8455, 8431, 8419 etc)

overall a nice addition to my collection, though not in my top 5 favorite sets",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
