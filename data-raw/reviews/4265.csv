The double wishbone suspension really looks the part but unfortunately it is rigid and does not move. The steering is very direct, even for a racing car. Additional features include radiators in the side pods and rear view mirrors for the driver and the wheels, tyres and stickers set the car off nicely.
Overall a satifying build and quite good looking within the limitation of a conventional stud building but it is a pity about the lack of suspension.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
