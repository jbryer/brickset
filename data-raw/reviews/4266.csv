"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-05T03:43:45Z","Looks like the real thing","10/10. Ten out of ten for being such an effective rendition of a forklift at this price point, though I don't care very much for the alternative dune buggy model.

What is amazing though, is the amount of pieces needed to put it together (about 70). I guess this is a consequence of the new Technic beams without studs; every other piece seems to be a pin or an axle.

All in all, not bad at all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T16:16:01Z","First studless Technic set for me","I just got this for free at Legoland yesterday. Thanks to my annual ticket. I really like this set, altough it's lacking functions. But for a small model it's nice.
Now on to my ratings for the two Models:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1.Forklift:
It's a really nice design for a small model. It features only one function, which is too fast in operation because of the rubber band. Too bad, that there's no steering, but it's extremely small for the 69 pieces in the main Model. It must be coming from the studless design that it needs so much, because you can't imagine that there are so much parts. Well and you can even put a minifig in it. Just take 2 1/2 pins, remove the minifigs' legs and put it into the forklift.
Score: 10/10
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Dune Buggy:
This is an extremely small design and has no function except for the suspension, which is powered by a rubber band. Well it's enough for the smallness of the car, but it's nothing compared to the older sets with studs, that had steering in most cases. But it's really compact compared to older models.
Score: 9/10
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is a really great studless set and even the alternate is nice for that small size so it rates a 9,5 but I rounded it up to a 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The 'A' model for the LEGO Technic 8441 is the forklift shown in the picture above. I found that the 8441 kit assembled well and it is interesting to see how the pieces connect together to result in the forklift shown above. Though you can't see it in the photos, there are simulated 'tail lights' on the back of the model using the standard 1x1 round transparent red plates.

The black and yellow colors of the lift arms, connectors, axles and pins make for a visually pleasing color scheme that I think goes well with the white wheels. I especially like the low profile tires on this fork truck. I think they make it look less toy-like.

Although the forks shown in the picture above are lowered it is actually not possible to leave the forks down if you build the model completely as it is shown. If you'll look in the photo, there is  black rubber band from the top of the forklift to the forks. The rubber band is designed to create 'action-movement' with the forks. It's a neat idea which has been used on many of the Lego Technic Kits dating several years back. 

With the 8441 kit, the rubber band allows the user to 'lower' the fork racks under an object and then the 'action-movement' of the rubber band will raise the load up for transport. Some might think it is cheesy. I actually find it to be fun.

In the real model, the rubber band always returns the forks to the fully raised position, I don't see any way to 'park' my forks like the picture shows with the rubber band connected. I personally keep the rubber band off of the model when I'm not using it. The vertical #10 axles on my model have just enough friction to hold the forks at most levels. 

I keep the rubber band stored on the kit's included rubber band holder (it's not shown in the pic above). I think that's a nice extra feature on the 8441.

Overall, I like the 8441. I found it worth the build, and it makes for a nice looking piece at any angle of viewing. The B Model is effective (a very simple dune buggy type of model) and gets the job done, but it doesn't quite have the visual impact that the A model does. Still, as with most Lego Technic Kits, you get two builds out of this one if you want them.

Nice Kit. I would love to see a reissue.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"isdera","2011-01-30T15:00:07.347Z","A studless classic","I quit buying Lego sets after I grew up but let myself get seduced by this one six years ago. It is a relly good looking build, and is one of those sets that came out in the era when Lego designers started to play with the possibilities of the new studless design. Not much functionality, but not all of the arms are either vertical os horizontal (as sets released in the past few years). which makes them unique in its structure.<br><br>The size is comparable to the 8290, functionality is virtually the same. The only thing I liked better on the 8290 is that it had new, bright colour connectors and new wheels. But if you don't mind buying some new wheels and connectors to make this set a bit more trendy, I'd say it woths the try. Now I have both of the mini forklifts using these new parts and they are extremely cool together.<br><br>10/10 for sure.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
