"BigMac","2010-10-16T17:43:13.92Z","The designer made fully use of the 327 pieces, very simple but great.","A month ago, I tried to get this one from Ebay, just because it looks very cute and interesting. I did not know anything about the set, I put in a low price and of course I couldn't win.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>After that I looked at the picture again,and apparently, I have most of the major/ important parts. I build this with my spare parts and finished it in two days, I can say overall it is more than 98% complying with the original design. technically is 110% as I added an air tank to it.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros.</div><div><br></div><div>It looks real but very cute. Colour scheme is one of the best.It is the first time ( as far as I know) that lego used the rear part of the vehicle for articulated turn.</div><div><br></div><div>It is the only one ( as far as I know) that has designed for double action with one pneumatic&nbsp;cylinder. The major cylinder controls the movements of the principle and secondary arms for lifting the grabber. Once you release it the secondary arm starts to go down first and after that the principle one will follow, and vice vera when the arms are going up. It looks interesting, especially when you add an air tank to it, so you can watch the double movement without busily pressing the compressor.</div><div><br></div><div>The pneumatic grabber works well and looks real. I will use this design for other lego technic lifting cranes or trucks like 8462, 8460 ( second model) or even the latest 8258. This grabber works much better than that of the famous 8868.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It contains only 327 pieces, very easy to build, if you have all the parts. Not like me that I have to search up and down to look for the correct parts.</div><div><br></div><div>Very high playability, the movement of grabber and the lifting arms makes you smile.</div><div><br></div><div>Cons.</div><div><br></div><div>I cannot ask for more from a 327 pieces set like this. The only thing I think of is the air tank, which would enhance the playability and even the aesthetic of the set to a great extent.</div><div><br></div><div>Value for money.If you can get this from Ebay for $40.0, just get it, won't be disappointed. The original price tag of $60.0 is a bit expensive.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading.</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"technicAlex","2015-11-21T19:14:41.52Z","Under rated set, larger than expected,","<p>Let&#39;s start, I love lego pneumatics, the speed, power&nbsp;and smoothness of movement is far superior to that of the motor driven mechanisms.&nbsp;I have most of the large pneumatic sets, the two JCB&#39;s, the black truck 8868, Unimog 8110, the latest Arocs truck all of which I&#39;ve fitted with an air tank upgrade.</p>

<p>I always thought 8443 was under complex and overpriced (second hand), but&nbsp;I fancied it and&nbsp;paid the going rate on ebay, which was&nbsp;as much&nbsp;as I paid&nbsp;for my black 8868 truck!!!</p>

<p>It arrived 98%&nbsp;built (primary model) and very dirty, I played with it for a bit, noted the&nbsp;unexpectedly&nbsp;complex twin axle steering, enjoyed the&nbsp;clever double action of the&nbsp;lift arm and noted the excellently balanced&nbsp;gripper. I thought to myself that the ingenuity of the designer of this set was truly&nbsp;first class. I planned to strip and wash the model, but&nbsp;put it away for a few weeks.</p>

<p>I was browsing the manual and noticed the rising rate mechanism of the main lift arm of the secondary model, so this gave me the motivation to&nbsp;strip, wash and once dry&nbsp;I&nbsp;built the secondary model. The rising rate mechanism of the main beam lift is a work of art, the height of lift and the increased mechanical advantage when the&nbsp;main beam&nbsp;is&nbsp;horizontal&nbsp;are&nbsp;truly ingenious&nbsp;with&nbsp;just a&nbsp;single cylinder employed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice mix of studded&nbsp;and studless beams, a turntable, gears&nbsp;axles etc. enough to experiment with if this is all you had.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The manual is one&nbsp;very nice A4 booklet which includes both models, I don&#39;t have the box. I&#39;ve only built the secondary model, but the build was more technical than expected, I wish they would include neater hose routings through the beam holes though but this is not a theme on many of the models</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Both primary and secondary are chunky and sturdy, the steering and lift&nbsp;arms work very well, however the grabber of the secondary model has limited functionality, you&#39;d have to build a mock shipping container for it to be&nbsp;used with as this is practically it&#39;s only application,&nbsp;maybe the grabber&nbsp;from the primary model would&nbsp;actually be&nbsp;more&nbsp;useful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fantastic,&nbsp;I now understand&nbsp;it&#39;s elevated price and it&#39;s one of my favourite models! I&#39;m actually tempted to buy another so I can have primary and secondary permanently built!</p>
