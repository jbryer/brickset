The tilting rotating main rotor is the main feature of this model and it works really well. My kids like this model as well and always want to get it out unfortunately some parts like rotor blades and wheels tend to come of easily.
  technic aircraft mustn't sell well as there hasn't been another since hope they do one soon.
