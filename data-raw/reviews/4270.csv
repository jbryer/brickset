The crane looks great but i think it's not realistic.I wonder if there is anything in the real life like this crane truck? The alternate models ( the unimog and dump truck) are better. But this is a nice addition to any collection. Includes lots of useful parts (liftarms, connectors,worm gears, turntable the pneumatic like lifting mechanism, cool wheels). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It’s hard to tell what exactly the 8446 is supposed to be (crane? tow truck?), and I don’t know what it was called in the catalog for that year.  It seems to me to be some kind of exploration vehicle.  No matter what the 8446 might be named, it is a grand set with a nice balance of old and new pieces.  

The main model is roughly the size of a shoebox when finished, and it has many functions.  Four-wheel variable-arc steering, lifting entry cabin, turntable with extendable arm, working end claw... for its size, this is quite a sophisticated model (much like the 8846 tow truck).  However, the 8446 is not difficult to build or modify.   Mine quickly acquired a six-cylinder engine under the chassis between the second and third set of wheels, with power going to the rear wheels (necessity caused the rear wheels to be moved rearward by one hole).

Once you’re finished building it, it’s easy to picture the 8446 roaring across the surface of some uncharted planet, with big clouds of dust marking its passage (while coating the cool green Technic pieces with powder).  It is a good set and is sure to be thoroughly enjoyed.  10/10 without question.  24 June 2004",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Crazy_Chris","2012-10-24T10:29:06.43Z","Ugly, but...","<p><strong>Introduction:<br/></strong>The technic sets from 1998 and 1999 show a beginning paradigm shift:<br/>Before that, all technic sets were built of classic studded technic bricks.<br/>After that, all technic sets wer built of new studless bricks (liftarms).</p>
<p>8446 - alongside with 8444 and 8448 - combines both worlds: studded technic bricks were used primarily, while the studless liftarms are added if suitable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong><br/>From 1999 point of view, nearly all parts of this set are very interesting:<br/>- classic technic bricks come in unusual colors (green, dark gray)<br/>- lots of new parts (liftarms, panels,&nbsp;hoses, rims and wheels, some bionicle parts), also in unusual colors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building experience:<br/></strong>To be honest: I dont' like the modern studless technic style. My dark ages started in 1992 and lasted until 2007. After that, I bought some modern technic sets and built them: No studded bricks, but liftams, axles, connectors... I really don't this new style.<br/>8446 is different. It#s a good mixture of classic bricking and modern studless elements. I really enjoyed building this little truck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Features and playability:<br/></strong>There are several working features:<br/>- the cabin can be tipped over<br/>- 3 axles, 2 of them with steering<br/>- rotabable crane<br/>- crane arm, can be lifted up or moved down<br/>- grabber mechanism<br/>All features are working very smooth, especially the design of the grabbing mechanism is excellent:&nbsp;the spring is used to lock the grabber's ""fingers"", so grabbed part's won't fall down again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary:<br/></strong>Regarding features, parts and playability, this set is a very good technic set. But imho, it looks very ugly:<br/>Future concept truck ?<br/>Moonbase transporter ?<br/>Alien mobile crane ?<br/>I am sure: this set would have been an all-time masterpiece, if only the Lego designers would have supplied a classic-style truck design to it. But now, it is just an odd-looking old set of '99. However, I like it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5

The two other models Lego are talking about are not too nice to build, leaves to much to the imagination. Like mentioned by others this set was I guess supposed to be in the miners-sets, but it has too much technic parts in it. I now use the bars and wheels for expaning my other sets.
A suggestion if you buy and build it: make sure the set is clean and set firmly on the table. Don't put too much weight on this set, since the wheels tend to run of the axels. One extra tip: be careful not to leave the cockpit close too long: the spring will brake. It has too much stength on the gas-lever...

Nice set, but somewhat odd next to other Lego technic sets because of the colors...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hoyngstar84","2013-10-26T21:57:19.433Z","Fantastic lesser known model.","After rediscovering Lego and exiting the dark ages with the 8043 motorized excavator, I slowly began reassembling sets from my childhood.&nbsp; 8446 was the second to last set obtained pre dark ages.&nbsp; This is not the best model by any means, but it has always held some intrinsic value for me.&nbsp; While looking through my inventory for which set to reassemble first, I easily chose this model.&nbsp; It has an unusual color and shape, interesting functions, and is a good medium sized build...a perfect model for getting back into the hobby.&nbsp; <br><br>8446 contains a good mix of studded and studless techniques as discussed in previous reviews.&nbsp; It also has a unique primary color that I wish was repeated more often.&nbsp; Discounting the mini tractor and some bionicle/slizer throwaways, the green scheme had a 14 year absence in a proper technic model. <br><br>The mechanisms are interesting.&nbsp; The spring locking claw is well though out, and the slewing turret is appreciated, especially given the sorry and non existent implementation of such a mechanism in 8421 and 42009.&nbsp; There is significant interplay between the slewing and pivoting of the crane arm however.&nbsp; It is necessary to hold the knob of the slew function while pivoting the arm.&nbsp; The model also features four wheel steering on the front two axles and an opening cab using the air cylinder.&nbsp; <br><br>Overall, there is nothing ground breaking here, but a good foreshadowing of the studless builds of the future.&nbsp; The parts assortment is good, with over 20 gears, lots of green, and a chassis that is easy to modify.&nbsp; Pick one up if you can, they are sometimes found online at a reasonable price.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
"Jayneflakes","2014-11-08T21:21:19.08Z","Funny little truck","<p>What a strange and interesting build, but the finished object looks fun, the functions though basic are quite ingenious and to be honest, I really enjoyed it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instruction booklet is a joy, first it is a real book and secondly it has all of the instructions for the other models. It comes in a large compartmentalized box and looks the part, all modern and interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is a mix of studless and studful&nbsp;parts, with some dead end pieces thrown in too. The biggest disappointment of this set&nbsp;is the damped spring, which seems to break all too easily. The set I purchased on e-Bay came with a broken unit&nbsp;and when I contacted Lego about buying a replacement, they were out of stock, so it was off to the market places. Finally I located a replacement and when it arrived, it had broken in the same place, but had been repaired with a metal collar. &nbsp;The mechanism for the steering is crude and not very strong, the clips that hold&nbsp;it all together have been improved on later models, but it works well enough to be a nice static model. Just don&#39;t push it across an wild duvet terrain.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was a challenging build because some of the details are fiddly&nbsp;but it remained entertaining through out. It was not possible to see the model emerging from the build until it was nearly completed and when it was finished it had a face that only a mother could love! This kit sadly had no model engine or anywhere you could place a motor kit and the only model in the instructions that could be motorised was a very crude truck in the most basic form.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is an ugly brute of a truck, resembling some kind of scarab, the crane on the back is clever and works rather well, although the turn table could do with some kind of damper and trying to move the crane arm into a lower position causes the gears to turn the turntable too. The rubber knobs for controlling the functions had degraded slightly over the years and felt a bit sticky and unclean.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It may be an ugly brute, but I love it. I recently disassembled it so that I can replace some of the worn out parts and the missing parts that I now have now collected in&nbsp;colour matched samples. For an e-Bay purchase of an old and dusty model, this one will sit proudly on the shelf next to the old classic go kart. This is one I do recommend.&nbsp;</p>
