"A_Brickset_user","2000-02-25T00:00:00Z","","This is easily the largest and best set I have ever purchased.  I recently review my 8858 Rebel Wrecker and declared it my all-time favorite, but I have to withdraw that after having purchased this super car (it indeed is super).

I had not purchased any Technic sets since the time of the Rebel Wrecker and simply watched other sets arrive from Lego in stores and catalogs and while interesting, I just had lost the itch for Lego.  This set really brought it back.

This set has all sorts of great pieces, many of which are new to me.  It is my first V8 (the Rebel Wrecker has a V6; sort of inappropriate for a big truck; only a diesel could give a truck of that scale ample power, like an inline Cummins TD 6 cylinder) as well as my first transmission.  The fully-indepedent suspension all around the car is outstanding and actually responds to road (OK, table) irregularities.  The steering is extremely smooth and much more powerful than my Rebel Wrecker.

The wheels are another high-point of this model.  The metallic look is awesome and they really add sports car appeal to this ""toy.""  The pneumatic (no, it is not hydraulic) cylinders in this set (two, count them, two!) are great enhancements to the realism and add another route for customizing this car.  If you want a smooth-operating trunk or hood, go for it.  The partial inspirations in the thick second manual can really get you started creating some really cool alternate models.

The drivetrain is very impressive and the curves of the ""body"" really make this car look sleek and the muscular bulge in the ""hood and fenders,"" plus the V8, give this car an impressive and powerful appearance.  If you have got the extra cash, I heartily recommend this model to reborn Lego addicts, as well as long-time collectors.  Newbies beware; I am an experienced builder and this model took me six hours to build (straight, except for the convertible top which I calculated to the log that I made while building the model entirely from the first manual) with the MB SLK-style convertible top (too bad the trunk still is not functional).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-12T19:20:54Z","Excellent!","I have personally owned this set since it came out, I fell in love with it when I saw the box in Toys R Us. Anyways, the kit is a blast to build, and the details incorporated with the kit's design are most superb, indeed. Not only that, but it's fun tweaking it like you would tweak a real car ;). I modified the engine mounts and put a V6 with something that looks like a roots-type blower on the intake manifold in, messed with some of the body styling, created a rear racing wing, and some other tweaks (I did try making the rear differential a limited slip :D). Unfortuantely, my brother got angry at me one day and decided to destroy my work a year ago, and I have not since re-built it as some of the parts for it were damaged and I do not have spares (the pneumatic cylinders for the gullwing doors). Still, great kit, great fun, I would reccomend this to anyone capable of building it, at the time I was only new to technic kits so it took me maybe 10 hrs spread out over 2 weeks. I don't have a lot of time to rebuild it, I spend time tweaking my computer now :).

The set was in perfect condition. I really liked the logical build by box assembly and finished the model with the convertible roof, as I already have an 8466 4x4 with gull wing doors. This set for me was a must have, and I paid a fair price for it, but like I said it is mint. Unlike a lot of sets with engines, with this one they have managed to sink the V8 low in the chassis making it a feasible front engine vehicle. The only bad point I can see with this kit is that the front suspension feels a little weak, and both front and rear feel too springy. I just wish I had bought one when they were in the shops, although I've only just started collecting just the biggest Technic sets recently. ",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-19T11:52:33Z","I have it and I love it!","The big deal about this set is the way you build it. Just like real cars, it's constructed section by section, then you put all the setions together.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T13:28:48Z","In Short WOW!!!!!!","This is the crown juwel in my collection. When I first brought this model home I thought; Well you will have it build in about 1&#189; to 2 hours time. But it was 4&#189; hours before I put the last piece in place, this is allthough I consider myself a elite builder.

The sense for detail in this model is unpresidented in any other Lego set. I can tell you that I ever since the first 8880 Super Car came out have been in love with the Super Car series, this newest addition is no exception. The 8448 contains alot of very very good features; fully independent suspension, six speed gearbox and V10 Engine etc. etc. And then the modular building concept is really great, you first build the chassis, with the suspension and gearbox, then you build the engine and decide where to put it, in the front or in the rear.

Then you build the interior, then the front of the car, then the rear. Then you again decide the course of action, whether to build Gull-wing doors or a Convertible. They are both exceptional features, using the delayed spring cylinder either to open the doors or to unfold the roof.

The whole design of this model is breath taking and I allways get lots of ideas on how to build more modern real car features on this car, I just feel there is no end to how many features this car could incoorperate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T06:28:08Z","This is a great set.","This was my first set with those new panels, and I must say, I really like it.

With the modular approach, the different techniques are shown to the builder separately, so that he/she can find out everything of this model. The parts are separated in eight sub-boxes, which really decreases the amount of time you spend on searching parts. The chassis is built with bricks with studs, while the body is completely studless. As for parts, it has really a lot of red angle connectors, and it has 13 red 12-axles, and about 20 identical red 9-hole bent beams. Alghout the body is quite open, so that you can see the techniques, it is a really good model. However, it's not as good as it predecessor, the 8880. Those wheels/tyres are very realistic with a thin tyre and a silver wheel. It has good suspension, beter than 8880's, and the second model has doors. That is the most beautiful model in my opinion.

There's one thing I really don't like at this set, and that is that there are not complete instructions for those four other models you seem to be able to build. I like some of them, but I can't build them, there are no instructions.

The front of the body is not touching the ground when you push the suspension down. The back is niether. If you push it down in the middle, it does touch the ground.

The five-speed gearbox with reverse is a magnificant thing. It is so much more compact than 8880's gearbox and it has a reverse. Ther'es room for a geared 9V motor to test out the gearbox. You even get two yellow beams for doing that! Tou can mount the engine in the front or in the back of the car, that's really well thought-out.

Overall, it's a good set with a minimalistic chassis that you can use for a hundred designs. Especially that front suspension is so compact. This is a great set.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T16:03:59Z","Simply Outstanding!!!","This set is amazing. I managed to find a brand new one at a fractionally lower price. Lucky for me as this set isn’t exactly cheap but I would say it is definitely worth every penny.

Being British, the first thing I tweaked was obviously the silly left-hand drive steering to right. Although there aren’t any instructions in the manuals on how to do this it is just a matter of &quot;flipping&quot; the pieces over. Those who have the set will understand. I left the engine in the front, switching this to the back is a matter of lifting it up and placing it in the back. Simple!

Everyone has praised the modular building approach and rightly so. It saves time and makes your life so much easier. Imagine searching through 1408 pieces for 1 unique part!!! Rather you than me.

This set really does look the business once built, much better than its predecessor the 8880. I prefer the convertible top model the best however I have it set up with the gull wing doors, which is not bad at all. Also love the sports style seats and the 6-speed Gearbox. Hook the car up to a motor and you can actually see the effects of changing the gears. That is an amazing feat of engineering.

Before this set I had not come across the pneumatic (spring) cylinders before but I hope they will be present in future sets. They work quietly and slowly which makes the car seem all the more real. It oozes style!!!
Talking of springs, yeah the suspension is kind of weak but the car looks great just stationary. The absence of beams has improved the look and there is not a stud in sight. The red cowling plates look great and do a great job of covering up large gaps. They are a regular feature on the larger Lego cars today.

It is a pleasure to build and also importantly it is a challenge to build, it may not have the 4 wheel-drive and 4 wheel steering with the differentials front back and centre as the 8880 does but it more than makes up for it in appearance, functionality and driveability. 10 out of 10 should go just to the designers of this car. Everything is perfectly placed.

I currently own the 8480 Space Shuttle, the 8880 Supercar, the 8448 Street Sensation and the 8386 Ferrari F1. I've just ordered the 8461 Williams BMW F1 which has a bigger set piece than the 8448! That should be fun to build. I love building the bigger sets and also have my eye on the 8479 Barcode Truck. But out of all my sets the 8448 is undoubtedly my favourite.

http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=30566&hl=


Here is the closing from that review:

Features
Interesting idea. They have a frame for the car that you build. From that, you have a choice of ""shells"" or ""bodies"" that you can add on it. I like the convertible. But there is a body that has gull-wing doors. Which is why I guess they included a ""Trans-Clear Technic, Shock Absorber 10L Damped, Complete Assembly"" that you don't even use for the ""main"" design. So it's nice that Lego gave some ""rare"" parts. As for what works, you have steering that works, suspension, and a working gearbox which I find so interesting. One of these times, I'll try hooking up a motor to it so you can see the engine move at different gear speeds.

My rating:
Playability: 4/5. When compared to other Technic sets, I'll put this one level below my 8880 Super Car. The 8448 can't hold up to all the technical wizardry that Lego put into that set. 
Design: 5/5. Like the 8880 Super Car, this is a show car at heart. Much more sportier than the Super Car. Maybe. Maybe because it looks so much like a Ferrari before Lego got that license.
Build experience: 4/5. Comparing it to other Technic sets, this is hard, but not as hard as the 8880. They actually put the parts into numbered boxes in this set. Makes building easier. Then again, since I was rebuilding it, all my parts was in one large pile. And I could still do it with relative ease. I guess all Lego is meant to be ""easy"" considering it's a model. Not like you have to ""build"" actual Lego pieces to make the set.
Overall: 5/5. Well worth buying. Not sure if it's worth paying the going price for it new. Heck, I've seen the stickers on Bricklink selling for over $70! Sheesh! I bet that's the reason why Lego didn't have any spare stickers when I asked them about it. Lol!

However, when you look at it you can understand why.

8448 has not got the same level of functions as its 1994 prequel, but looks miles better thanks to the flex tubing. This also means it's light, and therefore cheaper to make, so the Lego Corporation can get a bit more margin from it.

I built the gull-wing door model, but the convertible is just as good. Even more impressive considering it has a folding hardtop, which is now commonplace, but back then only the Mercedes SLK had such a thing. Lego had foresight!

The gearbox has reverse (a step up from the 1994 version), it has independent suspension all round, although this is not as good as the 1994 effort (and way too soft), and it has the usual V8 engine.

The stickers look great but aren't particularly high quality; the old see-through types lasted much better, and the gass struts for the doors are not very durable, both minde broke but were replace by Lego free of charge. I now leave the doors open to reduce the pressure on them.

"janverdijsseldonk","2010-01-29T07:47:34.967Z","Nice allrounder!","This was my first big technic set ever and it's definitely a must have for any Lego Technic fan!
It has great features such as a working 5 speed gearbox (with reverse) which is linked to a V8 engine. It also has independent suspension on front and real wheels. 
The nicest part of this set is the way you build the car. First you have to make the chassis on which you build the front and rear suspension. Then you have to place the engine and gearbox and link them together. Than you have to add the interior (dashboard, steering wheel and seats). Now you have a rolling chassis and than you can choose whether you want to build the convertible with working hardtop or the car with working wing doors.
With this way of building you actually can see how a real car is set up in a simplified way.
Concluding, this car has nice technical features and is also looks great thanks to the new body parts and flexible tubes.
One thing that is disappointing are the stickers, they begin to peel of after a few years....",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I&#39;ve had 8448 on display for a year or two. I&#39;ve enjoyed witnessing and understanding the evolution of Lego technic over time, and I think my building has improved because of this... I&#39;ve now come full circle and am a studdless fan :)</span></p>

<p>8448 when it came out nearly caused me to end my Dark ages... but that honor actually went to to the Robotics Invention System (RCX)</p>

<p>8448 is an interesting model, as the chassis is a traditional studful design, whereas the body/styling uses the newer style liftarms/flexibeams. Its the first supercar which really valued looks, and this is key. This is the model I keep on display in my living room, and just this weekend it elicited another &quot;oh wow, cool!&quot; comment from a friend who hadn&#39;t seen it before.</p>

<p>Like 8880 this car features the compact technic V8 engine, and full shocks etc, but loses the 4WS and 4WD which were showpiece features of 8880. I miss the popup headlights which 8865 and 8880 both had. So its the first supercar which went backwards in some features, but at the end of the day its a much more realistic car than 8880 was.</p>

<p>The 5S+R synchronized gearbox is great, but I do prefer the action with the H shifter on 8880</p>

<p>The dampened pneumatic/springs are possibly my favourite&nbsp;parts, that and the mag wheels :)</p>

<p>I first built the convertable with the hard roof, and then converted that to the gull-wing doors. Because two gullwing&nbsp;doors&nbsp;are better than one convertible roof ;)</p>

<p>This is my favourite supercar&nbsp;for display, and another critical milestone in Lego Technic history.</p>

<p>The manual is a very important component, The first book provides the instructions for the chassis, and the second book, in choose-your-own-adventure style, provides a number of different alternate models which can be built. Its fun to undo a few steps then take a different path and end up with a very different car.<br />

<p>The model comes as either Gull Wing or Convertible modes. These are activated by pressing a door handle and air <em><a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/32181c02"">dampers</a>&nbsp;</em>open the respective door. These broke early on but were replaced free of charge by Lego. These replacements have survived 14 years.</p>

<p>The stickers have peeled in places.</p>

<p>The instructions show several options for building different models and is innovative&nbsp;in that build options are created around a central chassis design.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car is easy to play with, has five speed gear box with one reverse gear and looks great. It looks like it is a real sports car. It has the right red colour.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have kept this model on display since it was first built and it really looks like a super car.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the 8448 Super Street Sensation is the premier Lego super car.</p>
