And yet here I am, in 2008, and I have no regrets.

The A-model for this set - the dump truck - appears a little (visually) bland. There is nothing that really makes it stand out. However, it is solid and functional.
The main function, of course, is the tipper. It works as you'd expect but the gear that you turn to raise the bed is a little inaccessable for those with large fingers.
The steering is articulated, a system which I haven't seen in a modern technic set in years - hell, I don't think I've ever seen another set which used it, with the exception of the 8296 Dune Buggy, which used it on the Tractor B-model. It works fine and is more interesting than just another rack and pinion system.
Overall, The A-model doesn't seem to be anything special at first, but it has its charm. 4/5.

The B-model - a road grader (I think it's called) - is well designed, and uses only pieces from the A-model - they do not give any extra parts exclusivly for the B-model, something I have noticed they do in more modern sets.
It is a quick but interesting build, with a potentially confusing part when you have to put in the gear which raises and lowers the grading element. It won't fit properly and I think this is why I had problems the first time I built it (it can be solved by putting the gear in first).
The steering is very different and was obviously the best they could do - a direct link which turns exactly as you turn the gear, making for some fairly twitchy steering.
It looks somewhat skeletal when built though, so overall, 3/5.

Overall this set gets a 4. Two interesting (if not very functional) models, and I hope Lego decides that one day, the Road Grader will be worthy of an A-model (I've seen it used as at least 3 B-models). I also think this dump truck is better than  8415 which they released in 2005 - smaller, but it looks more realistic.
I also believe this is amongst the last sets to include these kind of wheels - Lego has replaced them now I think.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-06-11T13:05:11.793Z","Not much, but it's good!","This was my first Technic set! It has working steering, and a tilting dumper at the back! The steering just turns the whole front section left or right. The dumper uses a system of gears to tilt it. Also, the tyres make this set quite bouncy!

Pros:

Tilting dumper
Lots of gears
Steering

Cons:

Steering could have been more realistic

Overall, a good Technic set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
