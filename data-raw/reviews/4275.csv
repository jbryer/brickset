"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-05T03:50:10Z","Mixed blessing","6/10. I've got mixed feelings about this set. The reason is that, when I was a kid, I got the 850 original Technic forklift. At that time the sets contained a decidedly different mix of parts. Now that Technic beams have no studs anymore, incredible amounts of pins and axles are required to click them together. Also, the number of parts that have a very narrow range of applications has grown considerably. Take for instance the 'Technic pin joiner dual perpendicular 32557'; the part number alone should give you a clue...

As a consequence, inventing your own creations seems a lot more complicated. They require advance planning instead of just putting pieces together organically and see what you'll end up with. I'd have rated this set a 3/10 if it weren't for two very big plusses:

Plus number one: the front end loader model looks realistic, and has great playability value. It also feels quite sturdy enough to play with.

Plus number two: there's no set at this price point that I know of, that has seven gears, a worm wheel and a universal axle joint all thrown in together.

So, my conclusion is that if you want a creativity sparkler, look at the Inventor series (e.g. the 4090 Motion Madness set, which I think is extremely good, is about the same price). Instead, if you're in for some digging around the house, or have a craving for gears and stuff, this is still value for money.

This is my first technic set since the late 70's and early 80's (I used to have a forklift, a farm tractor, a harvester tractor and a couple of go-carts when I was 10 years old, now I'm 35). What a pity, when I grew up my mom gave them to my younger cousins so I don't have them anymore. I regret about it too much!

I bought this set in Lima-Peru on 2005 at a small shop that imports Lego Stuff (basically brick sets &amp; duplo but unfortunately just a few models of technic). Paid the equivalent of US$ 35.00

I really enjoyed this set, I know it is not a sophisticated and complex set but being again familiarized with axes, gears, beams, universal joints and technic stuff almost brought tears to my eyes. I can blame this model for starting my new LEGO-TECNIC MANIA once again!

This model is really interesting. It has a lot of gears and functions. The articulate steering is really awesome.. It looks like a real front end loader.

The only drawback I see is the bucket device. There's something missing there. A couple of gears, even a worm gear could have made the difference!

Besides that, a good set for US$ 35.00 I give it a 4!

"Snojet_Steve","2010-09-13T18:36:09.603Z","Lots of feature packed into a small Technic model","<p>I bought this to familiarize myself with modern ""studless"" Technic. This is a very sturdy little tractor with good functions. The bucket mechanism is about as advanced as you can fit on something this small but it locks in place and carries a full load. I think this is a great little set, especially for the beginner or someone like me who previously only had seen pre-1990 Technic and wanted to see how the new stuff fits together.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
"modena","2010-12-16T11:34:50.92Z","Build on!","This was a nice set, except for some brick that broke.<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Great colours!</li><li>Chunky wheels!</li><li>Steering mechanism!</li><li>Rare brick for turning at an angle!&nbsp;</li><li>Rebuilds into a strange construction vehicle.</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>The angle rotation brick broke.</li><li>Not so much to do with it.</li><li>B-model looks a bit unrealistic.</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This was a nice little set. I got the main mechanism for lifting the shovel wrong when I first built it, but now it works fine. The mechanisms in this model are particularly good at the tension. The 8271 has more functions that can be controlled from the rear, but it is not as accurate with its movements. Something annoying was that the rotating hinge brick in the centre of the model broke. It wasn't until I got the instructions for the 8275 that I was able to order new&nbsp;bricks.</p><p>Overall, this set is worth having. There is lots of detail, and you can lift heavy objects!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
