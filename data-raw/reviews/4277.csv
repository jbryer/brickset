"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T19:40:08Z","Good job compressed air is cheap","A lovely construction vehicle for Technic collectors. Those of you with large hands and fingers (like me) will experience a certain amount of hard work when routing all the pipework. At one point you will have a dozen or more loose tubes and it will be very easy to mix them up (I'm still convinced it is the instructions that are wrong).

This missed out on full marks due to the lack of a small pump and cyclinder. For the price it would also have been nice to get a motor/compressor, after all there are A LOT of cyclinders to keep supplied with air.

There is one alternative model which, as is usual, is not up to the standard or complexity of the main one and this only uses half the available pneumatics.

Absolutely superb.

It has plenty of functionality and looks good, but if you can't easliy afford it, then you should pass, or buy an older technic model from Bricklink, 'cause something this expensive should give you a buzz every time you look at it, which those studless beams just don't do :(",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I have changed its style around, taken out the back Crane to make it more Tractorisch. I spent hours figuring out what could be better on this very realistic set. For all those Hydraulics an air tank might be a good idea. Though there is almost no room. I built a motor in but had to take out the steering.

This model is not, and I say again NOT, for first-time pneumatic builders. The inside of this model is really stuffed with pneumatic hoses, rods and axles. The level of detail is great. The motion of the front shovel and of the back shovel is very real. If you got big fingers it is not the ideal set for you, because you then might be unable to operate the handles on the back of the tractor, but then again you then could just admire the level of detail and the concerne to real mechanical workings on a real back-hoe tractor.

Amazingly intricate, functions just like a real one (except outrigger control is in the wrong place).  Everything is in proportion, from the front bucket to the rear smaller bucket.  Only problem I have with it is the yellow tail bucket, no air tank, and the studless design leading to a lot of flex in the frame.  I find that when I pump it up, the frame flexes a lot.

I've built many pneumatic sets, so this one wasn't real difficult to get right the first time. I also agree with prevcious posts that an air tank would have been nice. That's why I incorporated one into mine. It only took minor modification and really looks original to the model.

"jim2301","2011-02-20T09:59:50.117Z","AWESOME.","&nbsp;The title says it all. This set is quite literally, staggering. Everything works as it would in real life, take it from someone who works with these kind of machines. That is not to say that this model is without it's flaws, which are minor. The engine, for example, although very nice and works smoothly, could have been replaced with an air tank, which most fans of this set seem to prefer. Another point, is the cylinder that raises the boom, one is just not strong enough. There is a way around it though, if you remove the existing cylinder from the centre of the arm and place it on the outside and then add another to the other side it will provide ample strength to lift with minimum pumping. The only downside to this that I experienced was a slight loss of slewing motion, no great loss really. Other than that, this is a very intricate and interesting set to build, if you enjoy taxing yourself, then this is definately the set for you. Loads of tweeking opportunities, you can even change the buckets to fit your mood. A great all round set, go and get one.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Legolijntje","2013-01-20T13:04:10.333Z","A real challenge to build","<p>This was always one of the holy grails for me in the Technic line. And I finally got one MISB for a very, very good price on LEGOworld in the Netherlands. It's a fantastic set.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>There are 2 box versions. A yellow one and a black one. There's a bit of mystery around them, but the black box version is newer then the yellow. And black is probably (but nobody is certain) more rare then yellow.</p><p>You get 1 thick instruction book with the set for both A and B models. It's clear and it really has to, because all the pneumatic tubes going everywhere.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set is great for parts. You get 9 pneumatic cylinders, 2 black pumps and a lot of tubes and other Technic parts.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This is a really good and challenging build. You really have to look at the instructions to see which tube has to be connected with which switch? Where does that needs to go? etc.</p><p>You also have to cut all the tubes by yourself. LEGO provided a paper to measure your tubes so you can cut them at the correct length. <br></p><p>This is Technic building at its best! It really feels like you've accomplisched something when you're finished building.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is really good. Everything works fine and smoothly and it feels and looks very realistic with all the tubes. It looks a bit weird though, that the cabin is full with 2 pumps, but that's understandable with such a complex and relatively small model.</p><p>The model could've been a little bigger. It's a bit too small in my opinion.</p><p>Also, an air tank would have been enormous useful in this model, but they didn't include one.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this is a perfect Technic model. They should use more pneumatic nowadays, because it looks so much more realistic and it adds a challenge in the building process.</p><p>If you can get this model for a not too high price and you like Technic. Buy it! Don't hestitate. It's a very nice Back Hoe, I would say: the best LEGO Technic Back Hoe so far.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"Lexhoya","2011-03-16T09:38:33.243Z","Old-skool, but really good one to have..","<p>I saw a lot of people talk about this set, when the new version (8069) came to the market. When looking for this set new, is practically impossible and really expensive, so tried it in the second-hand market. This left me with a set for 60 euro's ( :) )<br>When 'playing' with this set when it's build, it takes some getting used to the controls, but after some 'back-hoe-training' it is simple to do. I still need to make the B-model and when that's done it will be recycled for parts for my MOC's.<br></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I don't have any box with this set, but I throw them away anyway. The instructions are simple and really clear. Keep in mind though that during the fitting of all hoses it is really important that all the hoses come and go in the correct places, if not it simply won't work.<br>The colors used in the instruction are clear, but don't try to put it together in a badly lit environment. Since there are many different hoses, Lego uses a lot of colors that look like 'the color next to it'.<br>I think even a person with no practical knowledge of Technic or Lego Technic can put it together. Can you make MOC's that's a whole different ballgame.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A lot, useful for this or other sets. A really good one to have, for the set itself, or for MOC-stock. The big front-scoop and the small-back-hoe-scoop are also nice to have. Until now I had to build them with bricks and plates.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None, although my little boy or now 3 added the Duplo Grandfather (from 5636) inside it, like he tries this figure in all my models. It doesn't fit, but he wants it to be on top of it ;)<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Lengthy but a real nice build. I think the B-model will be the same. With my current level of building I think it was about 3 hours of building time.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>In short: nice. It can handle quit some freight, since the front-scoop is equipped with 2 cylinders per function. The back-hoe however is equipped with 1 cylinder per function. This is enough for the 'scoop-capacity'.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you can get your hands on one of these sets and you want to know more about hydraulics, buy one of these sets. Because this set has 10 cylinders, 2 pumps, 7 'switches' it is a really good investment in separate parts. I think that if I would buy all these parts online, it would have cost me more than the current € 60.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"martiniman","2015-12-09T14:35:42.103Z","Timeless model you can perfectly build with today's technic.","<p>Finding the 8455 Backhoe in a nice condition can be time consuming or expensive. Big chance you already have nearly all the needed bricks if you own some more recent Technic like the similar but non-pneumatic 8069 Back Hoe.</p>

<p><img alt=""Overview"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8455-1.jpg"" style=""width: 1200px; height: 798px;"" /></p>

<p>Rebrickable is picky when it comes to colours, and on the loose-colour settings it might be too loose, replacing yellow pieces by tan-coloured bricks for example. We need a setting on that website to ignore warmish grey from old sets and allow blueish grey as exact replacement. If you ignore the warmish old grey, there is not many special blocks left on the 8455. So check the part list in the instructions by hand, and come to the conclusion that you already own most needed bricks.</p>

<p>I did, ordered a hand full of missing bricks on Bricklink and built this king of pneumatics</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are between old-style and new style. In some rare occasions, the viewpoint is awkward and you need to look very good how to put a piece in place. The tube-routing is assisted with colour codes, but these codes don&#39;t show up on the tubes themselves. Lego did not use the 3-colour system they use now: blue for connecting the compressor to the switches, grey and black for up and down of the cylinders. Since I have no old 2-tone grey tubes, I decided to use the Unimog and Acros tubes instead. I ended op ordering 3 extra tubes to cut in shorter lenghts in the 6-9cm range. This model needs a lot of those.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For most people with a large heap of modern Technic, you will need probably these parts to finish this model:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The 2 front wheels, although they can be replaced by 20x30 standard rims and matching balloon tires. They are less wide, yet the diameter is the same.</li>
	<li>2 black compressors, you could use yellow as well</li>
	<li>A yellow mini-scoop, black won&#39;t be a problem either.</li>
	<li>4 yellow old-style panels, two small ones as mudguard, 2 tall ones on the scoop arm. Replace them with new wings as you like.</li>
	<li>I needed 3 extra tubes to cut into smaller pieces, roughly 70cm in total. Most tubes I used are from my Acros and Unimog sets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t try minifigures on this one, they will be strangled by all the tubing in the seat position.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building experience is awesome. It is never repetitive. The model is kind of smallish, so you can finish it in a couple of hours. The only hard part is to route all the tubes. Especially the preferred route is not always clear in the instruction.</p>

<p><img alt=""Pumping"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8455-3.jpg"" style=""width: 1200px; height: 798px;"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model works awesome. The idea to use the front of the cabin roof (with the spotlights) as compression-handle is genius! It allows you to build up pressure with ease. The cylinders respond quickly to your pumping, even the lower one on the rear scoop: that one has a tough job and needs the maximum pressure. I can&#39;t say it is not strong enough. Replacing it with a longer Acros cylinder and an increased arm-length would make it even better though.</p>

<p><img alt=""Controls"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8455-2.jpg"" style=""width: 1200px; height: 798px;"" /></p>

<p>The pneumatic stabilisers are fun too, although they don&#39;t go fully flat. They only touch the surface on the outer edges. They also bounce a bit if you lift the model off its wheels while pumping. True to life, the model can raise itself completely from its wheels on both scoops.</p>

<p>The pneumatic rotation of the rear scoop is a bit cumbersome. It reacts very quickly to the double compressors, making it hard to do subtle rotations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the need for an air-tank. The compressor-duo has more than enough power to operate all cylinders with ease.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The 8455 is a true king of pneumatics. With 10 cylinders and 2 compressors in a very compact model it is LEGO technic design at its best. I do not agree with some opinions that this is &quot;classic&quot; Technic. It is better described as time-less, it has absolutely no weird parts that aren&#39;t available today. You could even replace the panels and front wheels with contemporary parts without really affecting the build or the looks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But here goes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love LEGO, I always have. I was born in 1979 so my first years of collecting&nbsp;consisted mainly of the classic Space sets from the 80s. Which I still have and love. Pics of some of my collection can be found here &rarr;&nbsp;https://www.rcgalleri.dk/fotoalbum/off-topic/39345-klassisk_rum_lego</p>

<p>I have a few Town and Castle sets as well, but I have not come around to setting it up like I did with some of my Space sets.</p>

<p>Anyway in 1988 where I got the Technic Test Car 8865 for Christmas. I didn&#39;t assemble it my self, my dad did, and he enjoyed it. Still have it, and it&#39;s never been taken apart since it was built so many years ago.</p>

<p>A few years later in 1992 also Christmas, where I got the Technic&nbsp;Air Tech Claw Rig&nbsp;8868. My first pneumatic set and I loved building it and still love it. From&nbsp;then on I just loved the world of pneumatic.</p>

<p>Fast forwarding to today 2021, for many years I have not really collected much Lego. I have on occasion&nbsp;built the Lego sets my nephew have been given&nbsp;for Christmas. But nothing major and no Technic set at all.</p>

<p>My love and passion for Lego never went away, just had other priorities.</p>

<p>I have been on the hunt for this set 8455 for a while, but it&#39;s proven difficult to find one where all parts are present, no pieces damaged by sunlight and have both assembly books included without you have to sell a kidney to afford it.</p>

<p>But I was in luck. I got one that&#39;s 100% complete, no sun damage to any parts and both assembly booklets&nbsp;were present and in good condition, the set was included&nbsp;in a lot with a few other Technic sets, among them the first Gen&nbsp;Mindstorms NXT, not sure if that&#39;s 100% complete or not. Time will tell, once I get to sorting it all.</p>

<p>Anyway on to this set, the 8455 Back-Hoe.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very cool set to assemble, but for someone who has not done any serious Technic&nbsp;assembling&nbsp;for years, it took a long time, mainly because the set was mixed in with all the other sets. So I often had to spend a lot of time looking through all the pieces to find the right one, especially if the piece was special. Still, I had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Many&nbsp;others have written this before me, this set is the king of Technic pneumatic sets. We are talking 10 pistons, 7 switches, 13 T-pieces and a whole lot of tubing. It&#39;s pretty impressive to have all that crammed into a model of this size. There&#39;s no room for much extra. Again as many others mention an air tank would have been a big plus, not sure where those who have implemented one into their builds have put it? But if I had one, I think I would swap out the engine block in favour of the air tank. It would look somewhat silly to have it located in the cab.</p>

<p>The set has a lot of playability once assembled. It&#39;s a bit rear heavy, so a weight brick out in front would have been welcome. The various movement and actions done by the pistons are smooth and precise. When, you push down on the pumps it&#39;s clear that the entire structure of the vehicle is under a lot of strain or pressure if you like. It&#39;s not that the model feels flimsy, not at all. It&#39;s just obvious when utilising the pumps, the model bends slightly below where&nbsp;the axis point of the pumps are located.</p>

<p>Even&nbsp;with the few flaws the set has its still a super cool set, and well worth the money if you can get one at a good price. Bargains where it&#39;s included is far apart.&nbsp;But if you see it, along with other sets or on its own, and it&#39;s complete then hurry up and grab it before your neighbour does.</p>
