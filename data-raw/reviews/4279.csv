Offcourse i couldnt resist and had to have this one in my collection.
In fact , a friend of mine and me were planning to order several of these sets over the internet.
And now that i own 1 of these sets,i can say i want at least 3 more.

For under $100 US, you get a battery box and motor, 20 pistons/cylinders and alot of chain. To get this much chain in one place, you would have to go to Pitsco, but with this set, you get much more. I liked this one so much I bought two for pulling competitions. you can even add an additional(not included) electric motor to give your puller more power.The pulling sled works very life-like, as it advances forward as the puller moves forward, thus putting more weight on the hitch point. It also includes an interesting video about the Lego sponsored tractor pulling team.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It acted like the real deal, but i thought it was a little under powered, So I bought another motor kit. That pulled the sled and then some. I played around with the different gear sets. Later on I ordered the tach for it. What a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
