Also being an avid F1 fan (including a web designer to one of the teams on the grid), I find the detail just so very well thought out.

Try and grab the Williams set too (LT 8461), equally stunning.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T18:29:07Z","Start your engines!","   This has had to be the most awesome set I have ever come across, and the hardest to build! i like technic elements but usually they make an odd looking see through model of a vehicle, but this, holy schmolly! I love the use of the curved silver elements. This, along withy the Ferrari racer are the best lego models ever thought of (Other than STARWARS UCS).  This set has the name of speed on it, the tires are plushy, and it even shows you inside the hood and into a realistic lego mold of a V-10 engine! It is super-hard to build, however. It also is quite expensive, so the cheapo who doesnt want to buy a 149.99 USD superlego set wont get it......period!  I love the race car sets and this, combined with the new ferrari and a few knew technic monster vehicles, you will have a loud living room! This is loads of fun, and it even provides a WORKING steering mechanism. Get this as a Xmas present or just buy it, it is loads of fun (WHEN IT IS DONE!). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dryw_Filtiarn","2009-12-02T10:54:22.593Z","An excellent set","I've been lucky to find this set for a bargain years after it was taken out of production.

Pro's:
* Excellent design
* A large model
* Good alternative models (both as secondary instructions in the box as well as the online alternative model)
* Beautiful coloring (too bad silver panels haven't been used more often)
* Excellent functionality (steering, suspension, opening motor cover, etc)

Con's
* Steering is in an awkward location
* The suspension is too stiff, which causes it not to get back up properly when pressed down
* The box shows the helmet in the cockpit, a shame there is none in added to the set.

All in all, a very good set to get if you manage to still find one. Well worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

- And it is beautiful, really beautiful!
- It is fantastic realistic!
- It is great fun to build!
- The suspension is working! Even I thought that this is impossible. I thought, that the yellow axle connectors would break und the first full load. But they don't! I bought the box used at xbay. And these yellow fellows where 100% new, not broken at all. And the suspension is working very well! 

BUT....

You can hardly play with it. The steering is horrible (beacuse the steering wheel is hardly to use - at least with my big fingers!). I am thinking of a ""God's hand steering"", but did not find a proper solution so far!

But still I would recommend it for everyone who is collecting Lego technic-cars!

Thumbs up! :o)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WarPug","2009-05-28T23:40:05.763Z","Magnificent Set","I originally purchased this set back in 2000 and got about 15 pages into building it, when we moved and I had to pack everything up. Nine years later and I finally got around to finishing this well-executed set. It was a real treat to build it, and I'm glad I had the foresight to buy the set when it first came out. 

Overall, the finished car is huge, it is much bigger than the perspective on the box indicates. The car features independent suspension for all wheels, a spring mechanism to raise the body of the car exposing a V10 engine, and standard rear wheel differential and steering. The V10 pistons also rotate as you turn the rear wheels. The build was quite enjoyable, I spent several evenings after work constructing the set. It is not a terribly difficult build, and the instructions are clear and unambiguous. The second model is a truck, which looks pretty cool but the race car definitely is the focus of the set. 

The car has a hefty, solid feel to it and the look is quite sharp. There really isn't much I would change about the set, perhaps additional mechanics beyond the ones listed above such as working disc brakes. I was also a bit surprised to discover that it doesn't come with the helmet piece shown on the box. 

This was a fun set to build, and makes for a great display piece. I definitely recommend this set to Lego car fans. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"geistag","2010-02-23T18:20:36.67Z","BEST SET FOR OLD SYSTEM AND TEHNIC LOVERS ALIKE","<p>Absolutely the best show-off car,put it on a shelf and no matter who sees it for the first time,will surely admire it and you for having it! As the others have said,it is a huge car! Careful details and old parts used with a lot of ingenuity. </p>
<p>For those of you who loved both system and tehnic models in the pre-2000,this&nbsp; is a must have! It is not the lengthiest of builds,yet it is one of the best and most rewarding because as you make progress you have to swing prebuilt pieces in the right position and usually secure them so as to move on. You get a lot of fun out of that!&nbsp; It had quite a few special parts in those days,but it still has a few,rarely seen on othe models (such as the suspension beams and stiffer shocks,the huge wheels) Also, the grey big pieces have a lovely metallic finish that really shines in the light. </p>
<p>In terms of functions,it doesn't have a lot,however if it's functions you're after, you shouln't have bought a racer in the first time. still, it has very nice suspension, a great pop-able engine cover (that uses dampers to shut and open smoothly),working steering (driven by the sqare -as it should be- steering wheel ) </p>
<p>I can't help repeating myself saying that ingenuity is at it's best, the designer managed to recreate in great detail the whole car (especially engine and radiators) and also the flexible pipes and hoses give it a rounded finish doubled by a great look as exhaust manifold and exhaust pipes!</p>
<p>This is my favorite set of all time (maybe also because I have long awaited for the chance to buy it - 9 years is quite some time! ) mainly because the build is great and most of all it just looks stunning! </p>
<p>I almost forgot to say that you can build 4 different models ! 3 are lego official models (F1,racing truck, and the Super street sensation and 1 - a supercar- from a man that truly deserves respect -and lego have done just that by hireing him! I don't think there is another Lego Tehnic set that has 4 alternatives in one (appart from the 8461 which is just a clone of this one)</p>
<p>Don't expect to be provided with the helmet in the picture or&nbsp; pumped up tires (they are ordinary flat ones)</p>
<p>I've paid the equivalent of 85 euros,and that for me was extremly cheap (I live in Romania and it's very hard to find second hand lego here,especially in good nick) so if you have the oportunity to buy this set,don't&nbsp; thick to much about it, it's great and you'll hate yourself later on for missing a great build ;) </p>
