"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T08:23:55Z","Excellent","My latest buying. I bought this set MISB in a decent price (80$). I've been searching it at an affordable price for a long time. Now i got it. This set has everything ( V6 motor, an air tank, 3 pneumatic cylinders) and fonctions like a real front-end loader. An excellent set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"garthd","2005-11-05T13:59:22Z","Very Realistic, lots of Fun","This is a great model of a front end loader complete with 6-cyl motor and air tank.  I love the working 4WD, and the functions of the loader are great.  Pneumatics were made for construction vehicles and wish Lego would make more of them!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2008-01-03T07:28:24.983Z","Proper Lego!","This is exactly what Lego is all about.<br/>This is&nbsp;a very good, solid, sturdy model that stands up very well to scrutiny. Every thing on this works as it would do in real life. The four wheel drive and knuckle steering systems work very well, with the added bonus that the steering wheel in the cab is also connected. The pnuematics work really well with sufficient stength to use the model to clear up Lego after you have finished building. Overall, a very well designed and thought out model, with only one specialist part, namely the bucket(one made from individual parts would have been far too heavy. Hats off to the designers for not using too many of those awful studless beams which I think take a lot of thought out of Lego. A good 5 out of 5. One of the best models you'll ever own.",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"BigMac","2009-10-03T21:58:25.983Z","Not many pieces, simple but very clever design, it is perfect.","I just buoght this set two months ago through ebay.au, not expensive just half the price as compare to those new ones sold on ebay USA. 

My comments are as below:

Pros:

1. Aesthetically, looks like real and in good propotion, nice colour used, it is beautiful.

2. Technically, close to perfect, its a 4 wheel drive, front wheel steering. When the steering wheel is turned, the whloe front part of the machine, includes the fornt loading bucket will be turned also, it is very differtent to ordinary steering system which  just turning the wheels, a very clever design. All the pneumatic components are used to control the operation of the front loading bucket, which makes the operation of the bucket very smooth, great to play with.

3. This set contains a lot of good/ useful parts, a v6 engine block, an air compressor, three pnrumatic cylinders, an expensive air tank and four good sized wheels.

4. Good enjoyment to build, its takes me five hours to finish. I never compete with time, I enjoy the process of building lego, great fun to build.

Cons:

Nothing about the main model, but the second model is still just a second model no surprise at all.

This set definitely deserves a 5 +++.
