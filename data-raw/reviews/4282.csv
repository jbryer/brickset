It has 8 bricks which fit over lamps for illumination.  This is the only set to find six of these signs other than the 5030 accessory pack; the arrow and construction sign are in the 6481 Construction Crew.  The set also comes with two light bars and plenty of colored globes to use with them, though yellow is the only color to have enough for both bars at once.  There are a few electric plates, but wires or 1x2 electric plates would have been nice too.  Two single lamps are included which both flash and burn steady; there is no double lamp brick but basically every other L&amp;S set has one of those.  The colored bricks are throwaway at this point; the real treasures in the set are the lamps and the signs.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
