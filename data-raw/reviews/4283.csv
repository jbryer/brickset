"A_Brickset_user","2003-02-13T00:00:00Z","","I am lucky enough to have gotten this kit before it was a reissue, so I feel special.  Such a great set.  I have switched it back and forth between the two models about once a year.  When I had it set up with the other option I once had a plow on the front and attempted to make a dumpbed.  This is the best Technic set ever.

Its mechanisms all work very well, and preform how they should. It can be compared to a real crane truck in many aspects. Its to bad that lego doesnt produce much of anything of this class anymore, for any serious collector or anyone just looking to buy an exceptional set, this set is wonderful. It is nearly impossible to find, and almost never in its origial box. It is still on the market but barely ever at a decent price. If found, one should seriously consider buying it, if not for personal enjoyment, for collecting purposes, and eve resale purposes in the future. Its a fantastic set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T09:41:20Z","Best construction truck","I own 8438 (2003 reissue of 8460). INHO it is among the best Lego trucks (others are 8479 &amp; 8868). This is truly Lego with classic construction. The steering works, crane arm can be lowered or raised using pneumatic cylinders, crane also extends telescopically, and whole truck can be lifted from ground using some intriguing gear mechanism stabilizers! The turn table moves the entire crane 360 degree. The scale of model is also excellent. It has seats for technic figures.

An air tank would have been better. Iâ€™m thinking of fitting a piston engine B-)

Another good point is that it doesn't come with any special built in motors. It is because I heard motors in 8479 &amp; 8868 often die too soon =:-o

I wish Lego had re-issued all their old classic models. I would recommend any technic fan buy this. It is still available in market at a decent price.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T07:17:29Z","No miracle that it is re-re-released!","This was my first big technic set. And it's still amazing. It is, as far as I know, the only set that is re-released twice. But this is the best set ever, it has so many techniques:

- four wheel steering with two knobs on the cabin's roof
- four gear-driven footers to stabilize the crane while lifting
- a rotating crane
- the crane is lifted pneumatically with two in-line cylinders
- the crane consists of two booms so it can extend
- a hook with rope

Although it lacks an engine, this set is amazing. It is not so huge, but all the techniques are well fit in. And it has a good collection of parts, especially a lot of 16-stud beams in the crane. This the set I have built the most. It's truly great. No miracle that it is re-re-released!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-18T07:58:58Z","Excellent set","Very good set.... classic pneumatic... main crane has several functions. 

The alternate model (Scania truck - pnuematic) is also very good. I personally liked it better than main model.

It also has 2 extra pneumatic cylinders.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Oneproblem he, the last vesion was supplied with thinner string.  I find tha this easily slips off of the pully whenever itfeels like it, thicker sting is really required for this model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
