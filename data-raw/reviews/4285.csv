This kit is awesome... and being a towtruck driver myself i can tell you that all of the functions of this kit are very realistic from the triple function boom that raises and lowers, extends and even rotates to the single function wheel lift that raises and lowers. The only complaint I have about this kit is that the design that lego uses on the wheel lift to completely raise and lower it severly affects the power of the pneumatic cylinder and it doesnt have a lot of raising power, but it can be used in combination with the winch to carry about any load... some support legs couldnt hurt either. I may tinker with mine and add some support legs and mess with the design of the wheel lift. Still one sharp looking kit with lots of realistic functions... a must have!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-03-09T00:00:00Z","","This set saved me from my dark ages. This is the first set that i bought after my dark age. I always collected lego catalogues and looked lego sets at toy stores in my dark age. But i haven't bought any. When i saw this set in the catalogue i'm not impressed so much. I thought it was a nice set. But when i saw the huge box on a toys store's shelf i was amazed. And i bought it instantly. And a surprise is waiting for me there was a discount in the toy shop. I bought it around $71. This is a huge set with 773 pieces. 6 superb wheels, 3 pneumatic cylinders, 2 air tanks what more you can ask for? A great set like 8462, 8459. A must have for any lego enthusiast. This is my favorite.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-02T12:50:21Z","A good set (to put it lightly)","This set is excellent.  I saved up for an entire year to get this and wasn't dissapointed.  The pneumatics work beautifully and very quickly.  I bought the Red Hot Machine shortly after this as it is to the same scale and works well with it.  This model combines the high amount of studs of older sets with the smoother appearance of modern ones.  I actually bought this just before it went out of production.  From what I've seen of other technic models, this beats the models of recent years.  I was also going to buy the Barcode Truck, but I'm glad I didn't— several friends of mine have described their problems with that model.  If you can find it— buy it.  The only problem was the lack of gears which is slightly dissapointing.  It has the sum total of about 10 gears (I couldn't say exactly how many).  It lost one mark for this in view.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T07:00:27Z","","With the teal-green chairs and dashboard, the blue tubes and the silver thin-tyred wheels, this truck has a modern look.

While building the chassis, it is kind of annoying that the back ends are not connected to each other for too long, the pneumatic pump keeps falling out. Also, the chassis is very basic: it's just two long beams connected at some places. They really did not add a piece that was not absolutely necessary. Which is okay of course, but theresult is a very open chassis. They could (and should) have added a working steering wheel from the cabin, and a driving mechanism plus cylinder engine.

The air tanks are really cool, they are a good addition to any pneumatic system. I also like the car lift system at the end, together with a simple yet powerful rotating crane.

For very long, it has been the only set with 1 x 7 x 0.5 lift arms, and those are so handy. The set has about 700 parts, which is as much as the newer 8435, but overall it's a nice collection of parts, which contain four blue 16-stud beams, and a few of the newer 14-stud beams. And six modern-looking wheels.

I have to admitted that the appearance of this model is a bit too futuris, especially the front driver's cabin. Anyway, this leave room and is not difficult for me to improve it. I think my design looks much better than the original one.

Tecnical: 5/5

It simulates very closely to a real tow truck. The operation by these pneumatic pistons are just perfect.  However, the lifting force by the pneumatic piston is not strong to lift heavy models. Again I improve this by shift the support point of the piston 3 holes to the back, just a simple mechnic leverage principle I  easily increase the uplifting for by about 43%. Now my tow truck can lift the front wheels of the  fire truck 8289 without diffuclty.

Parts and Price: 5/5

Two air tanks, three pistons, one compressor, three switches, 2 meter of hose, a large metal hook, six  solid 70 mm metal sliver chromed wheels plus almost 1 kg of classic technic parts, I  recently only paid AU $ 80.0 from Ebay Uk but of course I paid another $ 40 for postage. Anyway, for those in Europe and Uk , this is really cheap. I have already bought two sets, mainly for the airtanks, one used air tank costs me over Au$25 in Australia.

Aternative model: 5/5

The second model of this set is also great, good for display and play with. I add light & sound, technic figures and rockets/missiles to it. My second model, I can call it a mobile missile launcher. Great fun. This is the good part of Lego, allows your input , improvement and imgaination.

Overall, just managed to get a 5.
