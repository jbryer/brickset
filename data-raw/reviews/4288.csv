I got this set about a year and 1/2 ago as of(May 9,2004) and I loved it.  The only problems with it is if you drive with it to hard the front tends to break off.  The other thing wrong with it is you have to use stickers to add details to it as I've said before they just can't stand the test of time.  Overall A great technic set and a great conpanion to 8466.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is a good addition to 8466, because it has the same metallic green panels. I like the suspension and the overall design. Not so much needs to be said about this, it's just a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pretty neat.  The 8465 is a bit like the old 8845 jeep, both sets consisting of a great deal of hard-to-destroy playability in a small package.  It's little and cute; add a remote-control package to it and chase the cat all over the house.  9/10.  12 May 2004",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-11T10:20:34.727Z","LEGO Technic - Extreme Off-Roader Review","This set is one of my largest LEGO Technic sets I've got. It will take you a while to build it if you don't have so much experience with those LEGO Technic models. This model doesn't look as finished as the newer ones we see today but it's still cool.&nbsp; It also comes with a few stickers which you have to put on. I really love the design of this model with the big engine and the dark military green pieces. We also get a gear to make the tyres in he front moving and e also get a cable on the front. The set is fun to play with and easy to maneuver around. And we also get a second model which you can build with the pieces of this set. I think this is a great set for a LEGO Technic set and it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
