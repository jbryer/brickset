"A_Brickset_user","2001-11-05T00:00:00Z","","Perfect 10 kind of set. Besides the minimalist box (poor box with no plastic trays), absolutely the best lego set ever. Great look, great wheels and most of all, best technical set so far. Super suspension and steering. Looks better than 8448 to me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-31T00:00:00Z","","Awesome set, probably even slightly better than the legendary 8880 and at a better original price; corrects many of the flaws from the 8448 and is #5 on my all-time favorite technic list. The lack of traditional beams is not too much of an issue; these new pieces are quite useful in custom models while being lighter and stronger than the old beams.

The good:
-- drive and suspension on all wheels and steering on front wheels; not as good as the 8880 but almost there
-- has a 5+R-speed transmission gearbox; same design as with the 8448
-- mechanism for opening doors is a bit better than the 8448, since the panels on the bottom also pop open
-- includes four of the gigantic power puller wheels, by far the largest ever made

The bad:
-- suspension in the front is rather weak and the vehicle tends to bend down there despite the extra-stiff shock absorbers
-- the angles at which the CV joints connect to the differential axles make for some unnecessary friction
-- strangely, the rear wheels are not steered even though all the major parts needed to modify it to do that are used there",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-23T00:00:00Z","","The 8462 got me back to lego from my dark ages in 1999. But i haven't had much time for lego (too much work and a career to accomplish) for one and a half year (until march 2003). This set got me back from my second dark ages. And i'll never stop building until the day i die :). When i was a kid i didn't have any opportunity to own a supercar. This is my first supercar. I don't have any problem with new specialized parts like other radical lego fans. I like flex parts, panels, beams without studs (they're all lego that's why i like them). And this car is great: 4WD, 5 speed gearbox, independant suspension on all wheels, pneumatic doors, v8 engine, nice color scheme, brillant design what more you can ask for. It's the best and my only supercar (i don't have 8880). And check my gallery on brickshelf http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?m=fclef",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-20T18:35:23Z","Awesome Set!","This set has a very nice design with good function and a cool color scheme. The only downsides are that the front suspention is weak, and it's impossible to correctly align the steering wheel with the wheels. I noticed that you can easily convert this set into a truck just by removing the bendy axles in the back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-27T16:18:22Z","Perfect","Has lots of different pieces to build other models, the only thing you need is some 'standard' wheels. The front shocks are weeker because of the way they're placed, this is the same in the 'super street sensation', and the silver champion, so it seems to be a design feature. The inside of the car is made of beams-with-studs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-05T15:34:09Z","Favorite set..","This is a very slick set.  Couldn't get the guts to permanently take it a part, so I ordered a second which I will use as a base for a mobile robot platfrom (with the few extra pieces to complete the 4 wheel steering).  The doors are slick, and the drive train works great.  The chasis is bricks, while the beams and panels make up most of the exterior.  Under teh panels, there are a lot of pins sticking out, but most of they are there to more easily remove inidividual components.  On my current version, I've opened up the back cargo area and rebuild the dash and steering wheel.  Since both drive and steering are easily accessible from the truck, I'm hoping to connect a few motors in there.  Plenty of tweaking opportunity on this model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-08T13:24:28Z","First Technic Set...","This was my very first Technic set and my favourite. Even though it is a very complex set, the instructions are easy to follow and read. The front suspension is kind of soft but it doesn't affect it too much. It has a lot of features and it just looks great. It actually looks better with the design panels on but inside, it is full of plates.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-11T01:55:52Z","One of the best sets ever.","It is just great, 4WD, 5 speeds + reverse, doors with lifting mechanism and space to add things, like motors and pneumatics, if you try. The negative is that it has terrible friction, it s heavy around 1,25 kilogram and a weak front sunspenson.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-03T12:28:28Z","Great Model ","First off, I am not a big lego builder, I just pretty much buy the ones I like and ever since I saw the 8466 I knew I was going to get it, 3 years later I did.
Now to the model. This is a great model, it has a lot of cool features like the 4wd, the doors and the steering. First of all this being my first technic set I found it very challenging to the poing I had to take a break from building. I like the fact that everything works in conjunction and that the gears actually work, so in first gear the engine pistons move considerably faster than they move in fifth. The steering is controlled on the wheel and on top of the model for demo purposes I guess (wish it had 4 wheel steering). The suspension looks and feels great allthough I would agree with previous builders that the front end is some what weak but not a problem is the model is just going to be displayed. Finally the doors look really cool when they are working, The air pressure system used gives it a nice, smooth, and continuous motion, very nice touch from Lego.
All in all Great model, Great challenge, plan to keep it built for years to come.
PS
With 4 wheel stearing and a top mounted gun turret on the back it would make a great replacement for the Warthug from HALO     ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Only lacks 4 wheel steering though looks like it could be converted. Front suspension a bit weak and lots of friction. I'm loathe to take it apart so need another one :-). Would like to motorise but think that it will be hard to steer straight.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-20T10:08:18Z","Cool, cooler, Off-Roader","Being a big fan of 4X4's and loving to take my own into the mud every chance I get, I just had to have this set. I just love how the 4X4 action is translated into this (super)car. Most of the cool features have already been discussed on this page, but I would like to know how some of the reviewers here managed to get the &quot;terrible friction&quot; feature incorporated into their vehicle. OK it might not run too smooth when you take the wheels off, but that's just because the shock absorbers push a little too hard on the transmission. With the wheels attached and letting it's own weight sit on the suspension, it goes as smooth as a sowing machine...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-18T14:47:17Z","4x4 Off-Roader?","Hey y'all-

I got this set way back when it came out, and I would have liked it more had it not resembled a previous supercar.
The car I am talking about is 8880. If one were to compare both, there would be a lot of similarities found.

1) AWD
2) Independent suspension
3) V8
4) Two seater

The only differences are:

1) Has bigger tires
2) has more gears for the transmission
3) gullwing doors (honestly is there an off-roader that uses gullwing doors?)
4) engine lacking a Y-shaped piece (fan)

Granted these differences cancel the similarities, but I feel it would have been better had Lego used a different approach:

1) Real off-roading suspension (the type found on those mountain climbing jeeps, not indie)
2) A place for a transfer case (with the shifting lever)
3) different style doors (regular type, or better yet, no doors, just an open space where the doors should be)
4) A more boxy look (ala Toyota Landcruiser, the earely 1970s model)

However, I am happy with what I got.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-04T11:49:35Z","Wow.","
I got lucky on Ebay not long ago and was able to pick up my 8466 (with box and instructions) without too many interfering bids.  I had no clue what I was getting into.  This package soon arrived, from which I extracted this HUGE Lego box â€“ enter the 8466.  It took two evenings of after-work building sessions to finish this model!

This thing is soooo cool.  It's hard not to sit here and write a long list of the 8466's fascinating features, plus the other reviews do a fine job of describing this set.  I was most impressed by the four-wheel drive with independent suspension (stronger springs would be nice), and the gearbox and gull-wing mechanisms are quite remarkable.  The development of ever-more-specialized Lego pieces continues to be interesting.  My preference seems to lie with the old-style pieces; however, pieces old and new both contribute to my building pleasure.  

Seeing the 853, 8860, 8865, 8880, and 8466 all lined up on my dresser illustrates the degree to which Technic supercars have evolved over the past 25 years.  I can't wait to see what Lego will come up with to top the 8466.  Keep your fingers crossed.  10/10.  3 May 2004",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-22T23:06:10Z","For the off-road enthusiast","Here is a unique set that is a sort of combination of the two previous &quot;super cars&quot;, 8880 and 8448. 4wd from the 8880 and motor, trans, and gull wing doors from 8448. The CV joints used in this set are a very ingenious design. Until 8653 Enzo Ferrari, you coud only find them here. Makes for extreme axle travel, and gives realism to the model. Sports car entusiasts have 8880 and 8448, off-roaders have 8466. Great set all around",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"memjf","2009-04-22T07:12:15.34Z","Good combo of new and old school technic","just purchased this set in Australia for $325au on ebay. It is one monster of a vechile and combination of new and old school technic gives this model's chassis the rigidity it needs. compared to 8297 this is super stiff and you can push down on almost any spot to see the suspension work. The weak front end is an easy fix by using the shocks of the 92model shockcycle to give it twin shocks at all four corners. My dozer is going to donate it electrics to power this machine.

<p>A&nbsp;pleasure to build and has an impressive list of features that none of the latest kits all offer at the same time. I still have to find a kit that can rival the overall build pleasure of this kit, the only thing that comes close is the 2005 Tow Truck.</p>
<p>The gear box for example is missing on the latest off roader which I also have (8297) but this car is quite a bit uglier than that kit ;o)</p>
<p>The gull wing doors really impressed me at the time (2001), they open really smoothly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts are all pretty standard so no really rare parts here that would make a difference in your parts bin. </p>
<p>One thing that I noticed is that after I got this kit back after it having been stowed 8 years in my cousins cupboard, the suspension springs have sagged and worn out due to the weight, so I would advise anyone who has this kit to add a suspension more to each wheel or to dissasemble the kit to prevent strain. I took mine apart as soon as I got it back and bagged it with the rest of my ""stash""...oh and since then the grey parts have turned a really ugly grey which I thought was only an issue with older bricks from Lego...apparently not :o( Hope my whole collection doesn't look like that in&nbsp;10 years time :o(</p>

"cop014s","2011-07-22T16:49:41.72Z","Realistic awesomeness","I bought this when I was 12 or so, and spent all my savings, but it was completely worth it! This is the most realistic technic car I've ever seen. Complete with a steering wheel, suspension in all four wheels, transmission, pistons, and opening doors that remind you of the DeLorean DMC-12, this car is the dream of anyone interested in mechanics. I remember the building was long (though I was 12 at that time), but the process allows the builder to understand many mehcanisms that are used in cars in real life. In fact, this car helped me find my love for mechanical engineering. Some parts seem odd at first, but as construction continues, the builder learns why they have such characteristics and understands how they interact with the other pieces. Given the functionality of this car, it has a high play value. Suspension, steering, and transmission, what else can you ask! The only thing I can say is that I got this when it was sold by Lego, and it was worth the price at the time, and I don't know if it is still worth it at today's prices. However, this is one of the best Technic sets ever, and I completely recommend it. If I didn't have it today, I would probably buy it, even at such prices.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
