If I recall correctly, it was fairly cheap and certainly was fun to play with - it would have been nice to have a slammer to pit it against the Raptor.

The only problem is the use of elastic bands for the ejection mechanism - it works, but the bands wear down over time.

This set also had a B-model, though it wasn't great to play with due to an ill-thoughtout front wheel.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I always thought the front bumper-activated ejection cockpit was neat, but I only recently discovered that the alternate model, a beach-going trike, has *rear-wheel steering!* Shortly after I found that out, I took apart the main model and built the alternate.

To steer the trike, you can tip the cockpit left or right, and the trike will go in the same direction you tilt it (in other words, a rider would lean into the turns this trike makes). Unfortunately, the trike's steering is a little loose, and straight-line movement can be difficult at times (it's not very slammer-friendly). However, the steering can be locked in a straight position simply by moving the rear link back one unit so that its axles are in axle holes rather than round ones. Undoing the lock is as simple as moving the link forward one unit to its original position.

If you can find this model anywhere, get it--it's a lot of fun, even without a slammer launcher!

P.S. By the way, a TECHNIC figure barely fits inside the trike's cockpit without any modifications.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-12T11:15:13.307Z","LEGO Racers (Drome Racers) - Power Crusher Review","This set is a great set to have. I love the mechanism which makes the cockpit flying if you push the grill on the front. There're two rubber bands on the back which makes this effect happen. I've also seen two of the LEGO BIONICLE pieces from the 2001 Toa Gali set which makes this vehicle looking cool. This set is doesn't have a minifig and it's also so small that you can't put a minifig in there. I think this model would have been cooler if this would have included a launcher which you can push to make this vehicle moving. We also get some stickers in this set which you have to put on and we also get a comic. You can build two different vehicles with the pieces you get but you can't put both together at once. It's a cool set to play with and this model can be maneuvered very easily as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
