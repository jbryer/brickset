It had some pieces missing, but that has nothing to do with the set, as I got a used version. It runs great, and I love it! The only problem is it takes a 9V battery and 6 AAs, which sort of stinks, but oh well. Overall, this is one of the coolest sets I own.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Building is nothing special, part number is low, but the playability is awesome i use it ouside too and works great at rough terrain to, the B model nice too its an f1 car&nbsp; and the set contains extra slip tyre to it. It goes faster on these tyres. The 2 RC buggy engine is godd for moc-s too, its a good set! <br>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

I have the biggest grin when I use this set.","In terms of SHEAR POWER and SPEEEEEEEEEEED this set blows every Power Functions setup you can make, but it comes at a price of energy. In layman terms it does 4 miles to a gallon or 98 octan only.<div><br></div><div>But what a Beast! I just love it! I have extensive experience with PRO gas powered RC cars and 8475 can play along those buggies and racers, and the wheels are only medium size.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The build is quick and easy, not much else you can do with those ""body kit"" parts.&nbsp;The heart of everything is the RC receiver and it makes 1/2 of the car in weight and volume. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You can build it 2 ways but I find optimal setup to be a low buggy, that's in terms of controlling the ride.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The front steering bit is sketchy, not precise and the wheels come off easily from the suspension when hit, but that's a good thing sometimes as it works as a bumper so nothing gets broken.</div><div><br></div><div>With sleek tires included and fresh power you can skid this thing in place and do all sorts of drifts to the point of raising one of the wheels of the ground.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Forget about playing at home, this is too fast and too big, you'll hit everything. Slow driving also takes loads of power.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motors are massively powerful so there is HUGE potential to power big MOC rigs.</div><div><br></div><div>I wish it had separate receiver and power pack and the transmitter is on the big side although very sturdy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I thing this is the best speed set from LEGO and if it had ""Technic"" on the box some people would go wild to get it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I love the package and the Potential. I can use it to power big trucks faster than 3mph I can get from Power Functions.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
