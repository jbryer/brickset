"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-09T23:05:50Z","Best ever (maybe)","Passed up the chance to buy this new because it had &quot;new style beams&quot; (studless). Bought one used, and found out what I've been missing. Incredibly complicated and dense design. More features and gizmos than I have time to mention. It's a big set, and takes a long time to build, but it's worth every minute and every penny. If you are in to Technic, Sculpture, or just like lots of Legos, get it!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T06:15:52Z","","This was my first large white set. I didn't have much white beams, but now I have. It has just so many parts, also a lot of black. The shape is nice and it's really packed with techniques. I also like the fiber optics a lot. Building the model is much work, sometimes it's weak during construction but that is fixed a few steps later. I like it that there's a battery box in appropriate color in this set, and it's positioned well. I like the white axles and other white technic parts, and it has those &quot;hinge pins&quot; I have never seen in another technic set. And remarkably, it's in minifig scale!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T17:11:46Z","Great Set!!!","I got this off eBay for around &#163;40. For what it can do Id say I got it cheap. The colour is true to that of real Space Shuttles, black and white. The set also includes several new parts as well as 2 motors. 

It boasts many working parts such as opening cargo bay doors, a satellite liftarm which can be raised and lowered, a satellite whose panels can be opened and closed. The liftarm with the satellite is itself built on a turntable which can be spun left or right. All the functions have been cleverly integrated into a 4 way gearbox. The cargo doors, the liftarm and the turntable can all be operated using the gearbox. the satellite can be operated from a separate button near the back of the shuttle.

The fourth gear controls the Fibre Optics. There are 8 of these purely for effect but a great effect and first of its kind. The fibre optics glow red (this is produced by a red light spinning and lighting each fibre optic in turn) giving the illusion of the rockets engines burning. It also has a working spring-loaded landing gear (not electric unlike other functions) which for some odd reason is my favourite part. This is operated by flicking a Technic joint.

Construction is fairly standard and it is interesting to see where the new parts fit in. It was a joy to put together and comes with some great decals.

Would look great suspended from a ceiling. I myself have not risked doing this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-06T22:41:24.687Z","Incredible Technic set!","Wow....that pretty much sums it up.  This set is unbelievable.  The number of features is staggering, as are the features themselves.  Landing gear up and down, aelerons up and down, fiber optics, cargo bay doors open and close, dual-axial crane movement, and even the satellites wings open and close!  The gearbox and use of the switch is stunning.  And no pneumatics or flex system, just plain old gears and motors!  While I don't own some of the other big Technic sets (yet) I think they would have a hard time measuring up to this one.  It's simply stunning.  My congratulations to the designers at the Lego Company for coming up with this brilliant set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"haoye","2007-07-29T06:33:24.677Z","Best Christmas ever","I had the choice between this and Control Center II.  While the controlled T-rex was cool, I couldn't pass up the chance for this brand new HUGE set with the brand new fiber optic system.  The fiber optics are kind of a gimmick, but as mentioned in the other reviews, the features are staggering, and the design is really dense and great.  The whole mechanism for controlling so many things from the one large motor is mind-boggling.  The alternate sub model is also quite excellent, and I got a kick out of the motorized underwater rover that came out after you opened the hatch.  My only complaint would be that the &quot;design&quot; pieces were sticker-based and not pre-printed.  Also, the alternate model had different stickers, so if you used the stickers to make both models, you ended up with a space shuttle with some funny looking stickers on it in weird places.  A better idea would have been to have separate painted pieces for the primary and secondary models.  Wouldn't have cost LEGO that much since the original set was pretty pricey.  (I'm slightly jealous that you guys managed to pick it up used for so cheap, but it made a pretty awesome gift for a 12-year old that wouldn't be the same even a few years down the line.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kari","2021-10-13T22:54:11.97Z","The SPACESHIP","<p>This set is a true legend. It&nbsp;is ranked among the very best Technic models by many. Some say, it has not been surpassed to this day. I will try to summarize my experience and feelings about this set and give some retrospect to the era, when it was designed.</p>

<p>Sadly, I did not have it as a kid. I burned a hole in the LEGO catalogue with my eyes staring at the photo of the new Space Shuttle set in the mid 90s, and was&nbsp;trying to find out all the awesome functions it had. I saw and touched the box of it in the local toy shop when it was on the shelves, opened the front lid to see all the exciting new elements in&nbsp;the presentation plastic tray (yes, back in the day it was done this way by TLG), but it was way too expensive for my parents to purchase it for me as a Christmas present. Not long after my dark ages, I found a copy mint in box in 2008, and was just as excited, as a kid receiving the desired gift. My first thing was to put it together when got back home, and I must say that it has surpassed all my expectations. Building of the set was quite challenging due to the complex gearbox, lending gear and 9v wiring which were all crowded in a small place. Combining it with the old type, very concise instructions, it was&nbsp;one of the hardest&nbsp;LEGO build I&#39;ve ever done. When it was finally complete, it was a joy to look at.&nbsp;It was even better to play with, especially at twilight, when fiber optic system really shined. It was a miracle.</p>

<p>The 8480 Space Shuttle&nbsp;came out in 1996, when the Space Transportation Program was still running by NASA in order to fly those&nbsp;extremely complicated and fascinating real spacecrafts into orbit and back to earth, so timing seemed just right for LEGO to try to recreate these&nbsp;machines&nbsp;as a Technic set. According to Soren&nbsp;Holm, a former LEGO Technic Product Line designer,&nbsp;after a year in research, the LEGO Space Shuttle took three designers a whole year to finish. They did nothing else, which shows how much detail and thought went into the model. Around 80 working versions were built before the final one. I think it was truly worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At that time, design and aesthetic of Technic sets became more important, and as a consequence, the&nbsp;first studless beams were introduced into LEGO Technic line to create smoother and more curvy&nbsp;lines, and this set was no exception, new studless type beams were built into it to create the&nbsp;shape of the shell. It included&nbsp;two Technic 9v motors from the era, a standard one with high rev and a micromotor with low rev, which was also&nbsp;not so ordinary back then. These two motors, using a four-position synchronized gearbox invented not long before, drive no less than 5 separate functions: one is for opening the doors of the payload bay, one is for satellite arm rotation, one is for satellite arm&nbsp;elevation, one is for lighting the fiber optic system (which results in the effect as if the main engines were running),&nbsp;and the last one, driven by the micromotor on a separate circuit,&nbsp;is for deploying&nbsp;the satellite&#39;s solar panels. All these complex features work flawlessly when model is built with great care, and&nbsp;spending some time to discover and understand the logic behind them is entertaining. The fiber optic system was brand new and very innovative for 1996, powered by 9v, and it illuminates six&nbsp;optic cables with red light, only one at a time, when the central axle, which is driven by the 9v motor,&nbsp;is in a certain position.&nbsp;In addition, the space shuttle had&nbsp;some very good manual functions incorporated, controlled by the yellow levers on each side, these were the working ailerons and the working&nbsp;lending gear. The&nbsp;last one is definitely the most mechanically complex function in the model, which runs through the complete fuselage and pretty hard to construct.</p>

<p>There is only one problem with this set and this is about weak insulation&nbsp;of 9v wires. This is an era-specific problem of Technic sets, because TLG used a rubber based insulation material&nbsp;those&nbsp;years, which dries off easily. To replace frayed wires with new LEGO ones is an expensive and uncertain step due to the nature of the problem, and therefore unfortunately 3rd party materials should be considered for long term solution.</p>

<p>All in all this set has all the magic and praise well-deserved. In my opinion it is in the TOP 5&nbsp;Technic sets ever released by TLG and I would please to see an updated version of it in the forthcoming years.</p>

<p>By the way, I&nbsp;recently&nbsp;built&nbsp;the Creator Expert 10283 Space Shuttle Discovery, and though&nbsp;it is a spectacular set with very smooth lines achieved by highly specialized pieces and has some remarkable&nbsp;functions, it&nbsp;is more of a&nbsp;display model than a playable-technical one, and I prefer the latter. Now all I have to do is to build the 8480 Space Shuttle again,&nbsp;maybe to add some new elements to improve it&#39;s look, then&nbsp;to build the solid rocket boosters and the external fuel tank together with&nbsp;a working mobile launch platform and fun will never end.</p>

"jim2301","2007-12-29T18:52:07.153Z","It's got the lot.","This set does exactly what it says on the tin. The doors open, the &quot;Canada arm&quot; lifts and turns, even the solar panels on the satellite open. if that wasn't enough for you, the engines fire up. Plus, there's working under carriage and control surfaces. This really was a great achievement for Lego way back when in the mid nineties they seem to have lost their way.
 The build itself was difficult enough without being frustrating. the use of primarily black and white made the whole feel of the set much more authentic. lots of clever innovations make this set very playable and a very good display model, wether you have it packed away or in some form of dynamic pose with the satellite out. All in all a very good set. And to top it all I only paid &#163;49, and they even threw in the batteries for free. Brilliant.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BigMac","2010-12-23T00:33:14.453Z","This is the best of all Five Star Technic. Very Challeging even for experience Lego builder.","<p>I built the main model two years ago. I made mistakes after mistakes,&nbsp;it&nbsp;took me 16 hours to finish it, could be I&nbsp;was stupid or very careless. I remember just the position of the power line caused me to demolish the bottom part of the&nbsp;space shuttle&nbsp;almost completely twice. So if you want to build the model properly, you have to be very careful and follow the instruction about the positioning of the power line (none of the sets I built has such a strict requirement about the power line) otherwise. you may have to go through the troubles that I had. </p>
<p>Actually, I wanted to review the set two years ago, but there are&nbsp;too much&nbsp;to be mentioned, I gave up at the middle twice. Usually, I like to improve or modify technic models after I have finished the building&nbsp;of&nbsp;each&nbsp;set, like 8462, 8421 and lately 8258 (8258 is an absolute great model but has a deliberate mistake by the designer of the set). For this 8480, it is just too perfect and is so compact, there is no reason and and no space for any alternation or addition work, particularly for the main model.</p>
<p>I don't want to reiterate the merits of the set as it would be a very lengthy description, but I have to complete the purpose of reviewing of&nbsp;a set, so I will make it as short and simple as possible.</p>
<p>For the 1st model- the&nbsp;space shuttle.</p>
<p>1. the Candian Arm hangs up solar panels is just a wonderful machine, It can be raised up or lowered down and returned to its original postion. can be turn for about 270 degree, all operating by switches and motor.</p>
<p>2 the body of the shuttle can be open or closed by a control swutch.</p>
<p>3. the optic fibre enhances the beauty of the model very much,&nbsp;makes it so beautiful in the dark.</p>
<p>4. the flapers&nbsp; on the wings of the space shuttle to control turning, set off or grounding simulate the real mechanism to a great extent.</p>
<p>5. the color scheme black and white is actually very beautiful and complying with the NASA's real shuttle.</p>
<p>6. it is almost mini-fig compatible.</p>
<p>7. the retractable landing wheels are bonous to the design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the 2nd Model- the Submarine. Really, I found the&nbsp;submarine itself can be a prime model of any other technic set. It is the best submarine of all time.</p>
<p>1. the&nbsp;submarine is 100% mini fig compatible, I add a commander's deck on the front with two mini-figs a caption and a diver without any difficulty or a scale/size&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>2.the submarine can be open on the front by the motor, the design of the ramp allows the exploing cart coming out from the front without any diffuclty.</p>
<p>3. the exploring cart can be driven out from the submairne, the long cable allows it to go for about 80 cm from the mother ship, it looks very cute too.</p>
<p>4. again the optic fibre is just as good as the space shuttle.</p>
<p>5. black and white color scheme suits the appearnace of a submarine.</p>
<p>6. the propellor at the back has a good size and rotates by the power function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As both models are very outstanding, I give this a&nbsp; 2 X 5 STARS. Cannot not be better.</p>
