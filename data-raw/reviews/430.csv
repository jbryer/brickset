"KDog","2008-02-24T17:38:27.92Z","A sleek science vehicle","What really attracts me to this set is that is looks like a little race car that your Lego Spacemen can zoom around in. I'm also fond of the mobile lab concept that has popped up through the years in Lego Space, most recently in Mars Mission. This vehicle lets your Lego space scientist drive around alien worlds in style.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Way back when there weren't good and bad guys, just exploring space and doing ""sciency"" stuff.</p><p>There wasn't anything especially unique or novel to this build, but it kept a 5 year old happy for hours.</p><br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Removable rear ""lab""<br></li><li>Tons of storage and clips for spaceman's tools<br></li></ul>
<h4><br></h4><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Front tubes pulled off easily, makes me think all the tools provided were for spaceman to fix his vehicle instead of research!<br></li><li>Maybe it was me, but back in the day it was trial and error making all the tools mount to the rear station<br></li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>This set versus other classic space: it has a more ""finished"" feel; 
like it's truly a vehicle designed for a minifig. Most small vehicles 
seemed to be nothing more than a wedge that a figurine can sit on.</p>

"oldfan","2013-07-26T11:54:21.37Z","Came for the accessories, stayed for the nice overall set","This set was one of the few that I bought during the initial years of my dark ages (high school). &nbsp;My younger brothers had all the little space sets from this era, and ""borrowing"" their toys for a few minutes a day satisfied most of my LEGO urges. &nbsp;But I'd never had all the neat little spacey tools like the metal detector, so I picked up this set for myself when I saw it in the store. &nbsp;Now I had all the cool accessories, stored in the ubiquitous vertical clip plates, but I was very happy with the overall set too! &nbsp;Here are my impressions:<div><br></div><div>-Not too many small LEGO space vehicles had a fully-enclosed environment with the big hinged windshield part. &nbsp;The trans-green color was fairly rare to boot. &nbsp;Also, the printed 3x4 slope was unique to this set and 6970. &nbsp;The set not only looked good, it looked different from all others on the shelf. &nbsp;Still does!</div><div><br></div><div>-The six big balloon tires ensured a smooth ride over all surfaces, from kitchen linoleum to soft couch cushions to rumpled bedsheets, with no delays for the scientist on his mission to the next crater. &nbsp;The drive assembly is way overdesigned for the vehicle's size, and is therefore a solid and rugged feel. &nbsp;The feel of the big rubber tires is still much more satisfying than the solid-axle assemblies from the original space sets.</div><div><br></div><div>-I hadn't noticed the separating ""lab"" unit on the back until I actually started building the set! &nbsp;While this is a nice play feature, the little car design is stubby enough as it is, and looks even worse without the back end in place. &nbsp;Oh well, it's LEGO...The printed computer slope is nice to have along with all the diagnostic tools (welder, robot-arm ""sonic wrench"", and metal detector; a blaster for defense is included too!), and I don't think I'd had that part in my collection before this time either, so win all around!</div><div><br></div><div>-I never did appreciate LEGO replacing steering wheels and computer screens with that ""space controller"" part. &nbsp;At least the printed tile adds a little bit of detail to the cockpit.</div><div><br></div><div>-The usual 3-sided bricks with levers and trans-red radar dishes are present, along with other cool pieces like: 2 storage compartments, 2 flexible hoses, and the aforementioned printed pieces and accessories. &nbsp;It's a great parts pack on its own.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, while all the neat pieces and detail drew me to this set, it has a nice overall look and it fun to drive around.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
