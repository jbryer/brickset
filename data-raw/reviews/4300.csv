Some years after I got this set I went to a geological museum where they had an exposition with animatronic dinosaurs (like Jurasic Park robotics). I was simply astounded by the fact that the huge T-Rex in front of me. It was only half scale yet it needed more than two floors' space to fit in the museum. But what marvelled me most was the fact that it's move cycles were identical to the ones from my technic dinosaur. Naturally when I got home I rushed to rebuild it again.

Basically this set has a huge number of parts, along with 3 electric motors (quite a feat back then) and their big control pad. The control pad had a built-in memory that allowed you to record a set of moves and then have the program repeated. You could build a T-Rex dinoaur, a helicopter with a helipad and a hovercraft (which could be controlled at cable length, like a RC vehicle). Alternatively, you could build pretty much anything from it with all the pieces it contained.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I like the models of the T-Rex, the helicopter which is very cool, and the boat. You could control the models however you like and that is the way Mindstorms had it in the beginning. This is a Lego Legend and should be brought back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
