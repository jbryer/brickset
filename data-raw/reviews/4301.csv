It was my very first LEGO Technic set and it leads into trouble, because I invested all my spending money in the other sets. It was so much fun to me (and after I finished Medschool and now have kids it is again) to leave the path of the building plan and create own machines.

PLEASE LEGO, build again more of those sets, PLEEEEAAAAAZZZE",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:53:54Z","Forklift gift","Dan, who wasn’t much into Legos, owned the 850 kit since the time it was initially available in stores.  I think his grandparents had given it to him as a present, which is why he wouldn’t sell it to me.  I really had to search for it (found it one Saturday in the fall of 1982 while bike riding in another village.  Ha.).

I did get to build the 850 before I bought it, so I guess that’s something.  I would have bought it anyway, as it is one of the originals.  Like the 854 go-cart, the 850 has uncomplicated construction, and has a good mix of regular bricks and Technic pieces.  

As mentioned earlier, the 850 is a bit heavy in the front.  I had a piece of galena that just barely fit in the space under the seat and that helped to hold the back down (a fishing sinker works now that I've lost the galena, but isn't as cool because the sinker isn't in the form of a cube – oh well, lead or lead sulfide, it’s all the same to me).

The 850 is one of those kits that gets overshadowed by later, more elaborate sets, but that shouldn’t stop you from having a good time with it anyway.  8/10, 28 April 2004",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Widdi","2007-02-11T11:58:29.51Z","A blast from the past","I got this off ebay in sptember 2006. It contains a total of 210 pieces and was one of the first Lego Technic sets ever made, when it was released back in 1977. it contained instructions for three models: machine-thing, a grader and the main model the forklift. And three inspirations: A weird truck, a front wheel loader and a mini dumper.

The models:
Machine-thing: This is a very weird model, which isn't really functional. You can only move the cargo bucket up and down. There is no steering just 4 plain wheels to pull this thing around: 2/5

Grader: This has a very simple open design, since it's an very old design. The grader's plow doesn't move, because it's installed statcally in the middle of the chassis. It has a working steering, which tends to block, since it's very bricky designed. It could also be motorized by the 870 4,5 volt technic motor, but you can attach a newer motor, too but it will hang over. Overall a solid 4/5

The Forklift: This is the main model it has two functions, but it can't be motorized, since it is too cramped for it. The functions are a working steering in the rear and a working fork mechanism. There are two levers on the sides of the seat, which aren't functional, but nice touches. And it has a steering wheel like the grader, amde of a large pulley. It can't lift very much weight, since it tends to tip over if loaded with more than 50grams, since the backside is way too light. But it brings me to a 5/5 due to nostalgic reasons.

Overall: 4/5 for this 30 year old classic.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Forklit is good, bottom steering and linkages tend to fall off easily
the 2nd build- a grader is okay, again linkages are a bit week",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"TechnicNick","2010-12-13T18:32:02.5Z","Right First Time !","<p>Lego hit the nail on the head from the word go with this one. The first Technic kit is pure brilliance.. a smallish set, but incredibly versatile, thanks to a good mix of technic and ordinary pieces.</p><p>The main model is fine, although it does suffer from being too light at the back (easily rectified as others have said) but the real strength of this set lies in the endless possibilities.</p><p>If it's yellow and lives on a building site you can build your own dinky version of it with this! Oddly, the secondary models illustrated on the box only are more fun than the ones with instructions.. this level of versatility hasn't been equalled since in such a small set, making this superb value and a must for all Technicheads.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
