"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-26T13:47:17Z","Fire","These were one of my favourate lego series of all time. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.
   
    All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

That's the reason I give him a 4 out of 5. His weapon is awesome! The fire on it adds a nice touch. The thing I like about the Slizers were the huge gears! There so hard to find now-a-days. I just love those discs and arms! They were the best lego sets ever!

"Blade","2007-10-08T08:31:59.183Z","Fire!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Torch the element of fire. He is the only standing model that is, well, upside down, but it makes him different and if you don't like it, it can be easily changed. Out of all eight original Slizers, this one has the coolest face and his secondary weapon is flames coming out of his other arm, which looks just sweet.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and when I was a kid I liked them but thought two normal arms would be better, and look what we have today. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

If you also own 8501, 8502 and 8503 and combine them with Torch, you can make a super Slizer. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No real fault with this model and I for one am glad.

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:42:59.247Z","Torch","This is another set from the Slizers theme, also called Throwbots theme. This have some useful pieces also used on bionicle old sets and technic. The building is good, with differences with other throwbots, that makes a cool variety in the sets. The set is small and the playability is basic, with some problems due to the small size comparated with bionicle, but still awesome. Torch features a nice color scheme, that have the black and red colors, in a well made effect. The set also includes two discs that can be launched by the arm, like all the other Slizers/Throwbots. Torch have also pieces like two little lego torchs on the other hand and a well designed visor. Altough the set is small and the playability is like some old technic sets, i rate torch 5/5.

"krysto2002","2008-07-28T07:13:47.78Z","Burn!","Another great pre-bionicle set! This one defies the standard &quot;head on shoulders&quot; look that all figures usually have (though Pohatu is an exception). The fact that his head is not on his shoulders is a &quot;love it or loathe it&quot; thing, but for those who prefer the ordinary, it can easily be rearranged. The mask is really cool and will fit onto any throwbot's head. Of the extra collectable disks (not included) this one's disks are even cooler! The flames on his hand make for a good weapon, since (as shown on the disks) can be extended in a meltbeam like fire. This figure also includes the standard feet, as well as the &quot;shell-style torso&quot; which allows for rotation of the head and shoulders with the turn of a knob. Overall a great set, Bionicle lovers who haven't alredy tried them must give this series a go, you will really like it (but the extra collectable disks are really hard to find nowadays).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-09-29T17:46:21.983Z","The Hunch Back","Yes he has a hunch back. But it gives him that brawling fire character look. The face plate is very detailed and menacing. The flamethrower is kinda wimpy and small, but oh well. It doesn't take away from his overall appearance. The disk arm isn't posable, but it does fling the disk well. At times he is hard to stand up due to his small feet. I also dislike the fact that it takes a long time to position his head because of the big gear. 
Overall he's a great set. The hunch is fixable but I don't advise to do it because it gives him character the way he is. Unless it bugs you that much. I highly recommend him and definatly get him if you can find him somewhere.
