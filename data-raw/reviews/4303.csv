"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-26T13:45:34Z","These were the best.","These were one of my favourate lego series of all time. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.
   
    All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-26T00:37:07.38Z","Ice","This set was known as Ice Slizer in the UK, and it makes great use of the whites and blues to evoke that frozen environment.  This is the only humanoid slizer to have the throwing arm on the left hand.  There are a few nice things in the design - the ski on the right hand, the sun-visor (instead of the usual mask) on the robot head, adds to the skier design.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-08T09:20:32.653Z","Ice!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Ski the element of ice. He has ski's on his feet and his secondary weapon is a ski pole which works well with the lovely Arctic colour scheme. He was my first Slizer and coped the worst thrashing of all, one of the ball joints actually cracked but didn't break and is as tight as new so it really shows the quality of this line. His throwing arm is on the left which is uncommon but not the only Slizer with a left side thrower.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and when I was a kid I liked them but thought two normal arms would be better, and look what we have today. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model. 

If you also own 8500, 8502 and 8503 and combine them with Ice, you can make a super Slizer. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No fault at all for  this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:09:47.763Z","Ice Slizer","This set from the Slizer theme, also called throwbots, is like all the other from this theme, a simple and cool old technic like old bionicles. They are more simple and with not much good playability like bionicle, but still great. The pieces are in some sets useful, and the set features two discs that can be launched with the left hand. The color scheme is basically blue and white, that makes a good effect. The visor on the head also makes a effect, and can be used in other sets. This set is basic, but cool to play with. I rate the Ski 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-11T14:29:13.793Z","Ski, the Slizer of Ice","I got this off Bricklink. Slizers are like Bionicles but a bit smaller. Ski comes with one random character disk and a random ice disk. You can combine him with Torch, Scuba and Turbo to make Robotops.

Pros:
Can throw disks
When you turn the cog on the back his head and shoulders go up or down
Stands up well
Good colour scheme

Cons:
none!

Overall, a good set, 5/5

"krysto2002","2008-07-21T06:49:45.543Z","A predacessor to bionicle","Back when I got my first set (Granite) at the same time my brother got this one. This Throwbot was especially cool due to its posability and parts.

In comparison to the others, it lacks a full mask, which adds the 5/5 touch, yet this model, was still cool. The model includes two disks: the &quot;element&quot; disk for ski and the level 2 disk for scuba (there are 6 levels to each color of disk).
Also includes a cool carrying case, very unlike the canisters to come in later sets such as bionicles and roboriders.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-09-29T17:59:12.5Z","He has skis. His name is ski.","Throwbots are the best. I love these guys. Ski is a great set. The black face mask is okay. I'd much rather have him with this than a normal face plate that most other Throwbots have. The ski poll is goofy and impractical if he were in a battle situation, but it work with the skiing theme. The skiis are very nice and fit with the character. Once again I have to comment about the gear-positioning system of the head. It takes too long to angle his head. That being the only downside.
Overall a great set. I highly recommend him, but maybe not as much as other Throwbots because he does have a very unoriginal design. But either way, he's great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-05T10:10:00.76Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Ski Review","This is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This figure is also very easy to maneuver. The legs and the arms can be moved, too. The torso has a gear which can move the head and the arms up and down. One arm has a black stick and the other arm can shoot the discs.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
