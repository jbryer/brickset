"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-01T11:37:36Z","City","These were one of my favourate lego series of all time. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.

All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T06:37:37Z","So-So","This set is so-so, pretty strange design for slizer sets though. It's basically a car with an arm. would have gotten a  10 if it had 2 arms, but, then again, there's always customizing. I'd honestly prefer one of the bipeds over this.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-26T00:32:26.613Z","City","This set was known as the City Slizer in the UK and it takes the form of a vehicle instead of a humanoid.  The other set not to have a humanoid shape is the Energy/Electro Slizer.  The set plays nicely, and although it may seem out of place to have the throwing arm to one side of the vehicle, it doesn't detract from the play or the design.  There is a little gear which can be turned to change the shape of the vehicle which is a good touch.  The sleek green and black colour lends this set a cool look as well.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-08T09:45:14.67Z","City!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small wheels on a strange flexible chassis. Must have clocked up a few kilometres over the years and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Turbo the element of the city. His secondary weapons are his wheels giving him the edge in the city environment. Other members have commented why a car? Well Ice has ski's, Sub has diving gear, I feel a car is a definite necessity in the city. Has mask is plain black, no face, which makes it look like a full face visor for a robot.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and when I was a kid I liked them but thought two normal arms would be better, and look what we have today. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model. 

If you also own 8500, 8501 and 8503 and combine them with City, you can make a super Slizer. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No fault at all for  this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-03T09:24:26.003Z","Okay....","I like this Slizer but, there's one problem. It's a car. A CAR! Come on! All the others are like human forum! That's why I give it a four instead of a five. I'd get this set last if I were you!

"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:30:27.293Z","Turbo in the city","This is a set from the Slizers theme, also knew as Throwbots theme. Like some from the theme, this have not a good playability and pieces like bionicle, but they have more variety, and also some color features, like this green scheme from Turbo. The pieces are all useful and  the building is good. Unlike the other Slizers, this have four wheels and another building form due to that. This also does not have a design on the visor. The two discs can be launched on the arm, that can be bad positioned, but still in the best place to put it on the set. This set, altough is small and have old pieces, is too cool to play with. I rate Turbo 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2010-06-12T08:55:28.31Z","Cute car","Turbo is one of the most, if not <span style=""font-style: italic;"">the</span> most peculiar Slizer model. Whereas the other sets have the likeness of humanoids or insects, this one is, basically, a car. I originally found the design boring and unoriginal, but after I've purchased the set, it's grown on me. It's one of my favorite Sizers now.<br><p>The color scheme is magnificent. Teal and black with a little yellow mixed in. It just looks fantastic. The distribution of the different colors is perfect. And he doesn't have a face pattern printed onto his black helmet that would clash with his other colors. This makes him resemble a race driver even more.</p><p>He rolls nicely on every flat surface, thanks to his rubber tires. His gear-based feature is similar to most of the other Slizers -- you turn the knob and their heads move up and down. In Turbo's case, however, his whole front-section moves, and you can have him lying flat on the ground or rearing up in a hunch. This is where you start to notice the set's problems. Namely, if you straighten him out too much, the knob on his underside won't allow his wheels to reach the ground. On he other hand, if you ""fold him up"", the tips of his long beams will lift his front wheels up. I think they could have given him larger wheels to fix this.</p><p>His other flaw comes from the famed disk throwing arm. It works fine, so that's not the problem. Instead, it's more of an aesthetic flaw. He has this huge arm sticking out of his right side, with nothing on his left to complement it. It looks like it was just slapped onto him. I also believe he looks better without it. Of course, the line being centered around this disk throwing gimmick, the designers had to put it on somewhere. Still, I don't like the way it looks. Maybe if he had two...<br></p><p>Other than these, he is a really nice set. He rolls well, is fun to play with, the colors are stunning, and he isn't that pricey either. I got mine in mint condition for its original price, eleven years after it's first release. If you find one, and are into Slizers, get him. He is much more fun than his packaging art would suggest.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"krysto2002","2008-07-27T17:39:58.64Z","Vroom!","Of the throwbots, this one is really, really cool. This one is part car, part robot, making it even better. The designs are not lacking and the two fins in the back can be used (with your imagination) as either buzz saws, futuristic weapons, or even a device that self-erects the user (so he doesn't end up like a turtle on its back). The arm is on one side, and adds a cool non symmetric feel. The collectable disks (still not included) are also really cool, plus the one with him running from the truck is awesome since it suggests the whole city has a mind of its own and is out to get you. The almost untold storyline adds to the mystery, but from what I have personnaly seen, the storyline shows that the whole story is a turf war between areas on a divided planet. The black visor is really cool and also adds to the &quot;cool dude&quot; feel of this character.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-09-30T17:34:28.373Z","Definately great","The car design is phenominal! It is a great break from the original body design of the other sets. I also like the fact that he has a smaller gear so it is quicker to angle his head. The yellow compliments the black and teal. His arm, though, is a little obstructive, but doesn't take away from his streamlined design. His faceplate is black, but it makes him look cool and sleek. I don't really understand the prongs on the top. Maybe they're for stability? The wheels get bothersome, though. They sometimes fall off when he's rolling around. At least this happens on mine. Another downside is that he can't fold down all the way and still roll. But he's still amazing either way.
Very nice set, the design is original, and he's a car! You can't beat that. Definatly a great set. I highly recommend him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-30T10:12:36.85Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Turbo Review","This is a really nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver, too. The middle of the car has a yellow gear which can move the cockpit and the tyres on each side up and down and on the one side you can see an arm which can shoot the discs.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
