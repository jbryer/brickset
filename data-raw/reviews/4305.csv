"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-01T11:38:13Z","Sub","These were one of my favourate lego series of all time. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.

All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-03T11:05:38.893Z","Why take These Away?","As the title says Why Take these away? These were the best! Much better than bionicle.... Scuba had to of been my favorite out of the six smaller ones. The yellow tube made a cool effect on it! Also the harpoon made it look like a diver! The arm that could launch the discs was neat! I also like how th discs told you a story! The Jellyfish on the box is neat, even though it has nothing to do with the set. I do think the feet were a little small but the rest makes up for it! These were the best lego sets of all time! Get them if you see them!

"Novelty","2007-08-26T00:26:34.597Z","Sub","This slizer is simply known as Sub Slizer in the UK.  It borrows elements from the Divers Town sub-theme in that it has a gun and a hose (presumably for air, although why a robot would need air, and air transported in such a vulnerable way, is questionable).  The design though, gives it a scuba-diving look and the blue and yellow colours in addition with the design and accessories serve to give indication that this is an underwater set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-08T10:01:04.513Z","Sub!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Scuba or Sub the element of the water. Like Fire but with his head at the top and Ski but right handed, you are starting to see the similarities and how close these models are. Sub has a breathing tube which im sure is just to add to the diving look as he has no use for it. Also matches in with his secondary weapon, the harpoon gun. Also his legs are a slightly wider, probably for swimming, but why not flippers for feet instead of the same ones again? He also has a neat looking face which complements the colour scheme of the model nicely.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and when I was a kid I liked them but thought two normal arms would be better, and look what we have today. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model. 

If you also own 8500, 8501 and 8502 and combine them with Sub, you can make a super Slizer. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. Only real fault is the feet but that could be said about any of the three other originals. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:50:40.093Z","Scuba","Scuba looks like some other Throwbots/Slizes sets due to the simple and nice building. This features some differences from the blue color with few yellow. The building is good alongside with the design. The Scuba's visor that likes a mask is an cool effect on the design, and also is the tube and harpoon. All the pieces are useful and somo were used also on old bionicle and technic themes. The playability is not the best, due to the size of the set, and also the little feet and long arm. The right arm of the Scuba, like the other throwbots, can launch one of the two discs included, that have some cool color combinations when alongside the set. Altough looks like with few pieces and so small in relation with new bionicle, this set is cool to play with and i rate the Scuba 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T16:55:32.45Z","Deep Sea Diver","Very good design. Definately looks like a water-based character. The yellow compliments the blue color. He also has the breathing tube that adds to sub's (or scuba, as I believe have called him) overall appearance. The small gear is a good move because it is quick to position his head. The head, speaking of which, is as usual very detailed with a ""snorkle"" and a breathing mouthpiece.The harpoon launcher, though is a little small, but it works with the character. And that's pretty much all.
Overall, a very nice figure. The design and build says deep sea diver. I recommend getting this figure. If you can find him get him.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-06T10:04:05.927Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Scuba Review","This is a fun figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we get no stickers to worry about. This set is very easy to maneuver as well. The torso has a gear which can move the head and the arms up and/or down. One arm has a harpoon and the other arm is able to shoot a disc.   As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
