"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-26T13:46:27Z","JUDGE","These were one of my favourate lego series of all time. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.
   
    All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2006-08-26T18:46:47Z","I agree!!","these were AWESOME! they had many different types, and also could be used to build bigger set. these are way better than any bionicle because bionicle usually just used the same body but in a different colour and a different mask and weapon.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-08T10:16:11.763Z","Judge!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Jet the Judge of the competition. He is the only original model that has two throwing arms, not to mention a pair of wings with rotors, which make him a dangerous opponent. His face is different again and very robot looking. Also by punning his head up his wings retract and pushing down make them come out. This in my opinion is the coolest fold, flip or wind in the original Slizer group.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and when I was a kid I liked them but thought two normal arms would be better, this particular model has two disk launchers. The disk launchers are very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model. 

If you also own 8505, 8506 and 8507 and combine them with Judge, you can make a second super Slizer that is ver different to the first. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No fault at all for  this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:24:17.92Z","Fly, Jet!","This set is one of the sets of the Slizers, also knew as Throwbots theme. Like all the other from this theme, this is cool, altough looks like simple, comparing with bionicle. The pieces included are all useful, but most in the bionicle and technic themes.
This set features a awesome yellow and black color scheme. The visor have a design that makes a nice effect, and two propellers are also included. This set have a playability like some of the other throwbots, that is not the best due to the size and old pieces, but still good to play with. So, i rate this set 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-27T17:53:30.53Z","Wow","An awkwardly designed throwbot, giving it both speed, and strength on land and in the air. This figure has two arms, allowing for more rapid fire, and the classic &quot;one, two&quot; attack. The body is beyond unique since it uses what I call the &quot;box torso&quot; instead of the often used &quot;shell torso&quot; with most other throwbots. This guy is actually called jet, which is cool since it can refer to both his ability and his dark, mysterious appearance. He is the most powerful of the original 8, since only he has a disk with 8 of the 8 dots filled in! The odd design of his torso allows his head to move up and down, also cotrolling the mowement of his wings. The body looks coolest when streamlined and flying. His disks (not included) are coolest, since most embody all eight Throwbots at once! This is my favorite of the bunch and it is obvious to see why!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T17:11:49.497Z","Very... Interesting","Really, the title says most. I don't know where to start. 
Well, the problems I have with this set are:
1. The legs are placed oddly. They are on his stomach, making him look kinda fat. 
2. The arms are also oddly positioned. You can't really put his arms down. You can only put them down in front of his legs, or straight down behind them.
Anyways, It is still a good set. He's one of two throwbots sets that have a ball-jointed head (the other being Electro) He also has the oh-so common black and yellow color. The wings  remind me of an Ospry (not the bird, the military vehicle). Both he and the Ospry have airplan-like wings, but mounted on each wing are propellers. It would have been cool if the propellers could rotate so they could be facing forward so he could fly forward. 
In conclusion another great Slizer set. Recommended. So go get him. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2010-06-02T08:40:58.747Z","My first Slizer experience in a long time","<p>Actually, the very first one I even owned. I bought it used, and after a long cleaning session, I was finally able to look at the finished thing in all its shiny Slizer glory -- with only a minimal amount of scratches.</p><p>My first impression: it is bigger than I remembered these to be. And that is fine with me. Judge/Jet is, I've heard it said, one of the better sets that came out in the line, and I can do nothing but agree with that. While the proportions are awkward, as is the general build of the robot, and the articulation is hindered in places, the overall look is quite impressive. And it doesn't look at all so flattened like in the set's promotional image.</p><p>I also like the symmetry. Although I don't care much for the throwing feature (not that it doesn't work fine, it really does), giving the model two identical throwing arms was a good decision. It looks much more solid than other, asymmetrical Slizers, seems less ""thrown-together"", which is the feeling some of the models gave me, to be honest.</p><p>Another improvement over most of his fellows is the ball-jointed neck. It predates the first such articulation point of the Bionicle toy-line, and he manages to pull off poses that would still be near impossible for his descendants for years after his release. And he doesn't lose special gimmicks this way either. For sacrificing the huge rotating gear that most of the other sets had, he received a wing-flapping mechanism -- by pulling and pushing his head back and forth, you operate the wings on his back. And if they look like they're too small and flimsy to lift him up, the two propellers on each wingtip will surely give him the boost he needs to lift up. If not, he could still flap with his symmetrical arms, I suppose.</p><p>The legs are the weaker part of the set. He has trouble standing the way the instructions depict him (bending forward), and the way the legs attach to the torso means if you straighten him up, his arms can't be bent down full. If you don't display him in a flying position, I believe a hunched pose would be the best. Or you can fold him up and pack him into his container, if you wish.</p><p>Another problem I noticed with his ""crotch"" construction is that the two pieces that make up the bulk of his torso don't connect at the rear, and if you flap the wings too wildly, they can split slightly apart.<br></p><p>But all in all? A decent robot. It might look strange to anyone that's not familiar with the theme, but among his Slizer brethren, he stands out as one of the best looking and best constructed. On its own, I might rate it only a 4 out of 5, but taking all the Slizers into consideration, he deserves a 5. Also, let us not forget he came from the time before the more advanced looking models of such lines like Bionicle, and on top of that, has a much, much bigger variety of parts than some of the later, similarly-priced sets.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-30T10:23:40.793Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Jet Review","This set is a nice and easy build and it's fun to play with as well. It's also very easy to maneuver it and we also don't need to worry about stickers. If you move the head forwards and/or backwards you can move the wings which have a propeller on the top which sviwels full 360Â°. This figure has two arms which you can move if you want to shoot the disc.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2010-06-11T19:53:54.077Z","While Throwbots are great as whole, this a bit ugly","Most of the time, the old Throwbots/Slizers rocked. This is the exception. It is one of the three that I own. The main problem with this set is that it doesn't look good. When standing up straight, the head has to stick too far forward and the arms appear to be crucified if you don't make the face forward too, adding on to this ugly work. Flight mode is pretty good though. Also, the function of the head moving the wings up and down rocks. The set does include quite a few good parts and great functions, but is probably only worth much to people collecting an entire theme, not to the average person seeking a good-looking playable set.",FALSE,4,5,4,3,3
