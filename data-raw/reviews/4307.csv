"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-05T00:00:00Z","","I agree, Throwbots, Roboriders, Bionicle, and all the rest of the newer Technic sets should be in a Technic2 category. A friend and I once or twice gathered all our Throw Bots, and had big wars on his bunk bed. This was my prize robot for sneaking around and jumping. Different Bots had different ""sneakability"" rates, ""jumppower"" rates, and strength rates. (he had an eight or a nine in both) This was my most powerful one since we both agreed using our superbots (his Giant black and yellow one, and my two Millenias) would be unfair for the ""little guys"".",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-01T11:39:00Z","Jungle","These were one of my favourate lego series of all time. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.

All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-09T09:24:58.937Z","Jungle!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Amazon of the Jungle. He is green and aqua with a hint of black for his face aerial and sword. The face is one of the best in the series. Very tiger like and well suited to the jungle. The aerial must be an extra like sub's breathing hose, just added on to make a little different and to offset a small human weapon. The sword its self is awesome. cutting down a full size mutant tree or that just might have to do with the power of this particular character.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and when I was a kid I liked them but thought two normal arms would be better, and look what we have today. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model. 

If you also own 8504, 8506 and 8507 and combine them with Jungle, you can make a second super Slizer that is very different to the first. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No fault at all for  this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:17:35.28Z","Amazon ","This set from the Slizer theme, also knew as Throwbot theme, is like some of the others from this theme, a basic set that precede the bionicle line and still cool as it. This have a playability that is not the best but still cool. The color scheme features two green colors that makes a nice effect. This set have a visor with some designs, another feature, and also a katana, also used in minifigures. The two discs included can be launched by the right arm of amazon. Some pieces are so useful for bionicle themes or technic. The set is too cool to play with, altough the pieces aren't new and it is small. So, i rate this 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-27T17:46:47.437Z","Slash!","Of the throwbots, this one is the second coolest. He has plenty of detail, and unlike the others, also has an antennae! The sword he has is a bit out of proportion, lost to the size of this figure. The head and upper torso is posable, via gears. The whole figure is cool and includes the throwbot feet! The setting of the whole series is on a divided planet, and the coolest part is that a large portion of the world is living, so the treacherous environment is made deadly since everything is out to get you; the cars, the trees, the fire, lava, sea creatures, the sky, the weather, and even the mountains themselves! This character battles the endless legions of plants in a dense jungle and is well equipped t do so. All in all the set is cool with a carrying case. Also, these sets don't need to be partially disassembled to be stored like th older bionicles!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T17:21:26.717Z","pitiful sword","He's... unoriginal. The tiger helmet, though is a nice touch. His sword is too small. It should have been a bit bigger. The antenna adds a bit of originality (sadly I lost mine. I'm looking for one, but I 'll probably just buy another). And now, I must again complain about that big gear. Though it does look good on the set (along with others), it takes way too long to angle his head. And that, really is all.
Overall, a great set. I believe he was one of my favorite sets back in the day. Regardless of unoriginality, I highly recommend his.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-05T10:15:42.933Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Amazon Review","This is a cool figure to have and it's also a great addition to any LEGO collection. The build is very easy and we also don't need to put on stickers. This figure is very easy to maneuver and to play with as well. The torso has a gear which can move the head and the arms up and down. One arm has a sword and the other arm is able to shoot the disc. You can also find an antenna on the back of the figure.  As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
