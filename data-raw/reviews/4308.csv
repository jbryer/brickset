When you pull some odd looking piece, the pick axes move forward and backward. He transforms into a little rectangular...something, maybe a tank, and fits easily into his pod he was packaged in. Him and three other Throw Bots (8504, 8505, and 8507 are the others) can be taken apart and combined to become a very ugly super model. Part of the instructions are in each instruction booklet.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Launching them was fun and easy. If you pussed the head in the picks would move. This was defenantly the best one!

The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Granite or Rock the element of Earth. Being one of the three original models not in Human like shape he walks on all fours and having his disk launcher as his arm would make it difficult. He and Ski are the only two that have visors and it really adds to the look of cool. Also being on all fours leaves him open to attack from the top, but not this dude. He has a pair of swinging picks to defend against attack just like a porcupine or other pointy animal.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and this particular models dick launcher is his tail. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model. 

If you also own 8504, 8505 and 8507 and combine them with Rock, you can make a second super Slizer that is very different to the first. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No fault at all for  this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:56:39Z","Granite","Granite is one of the Throwbots/Slizers sets, that like other technic and old classic bionicle, features old and useful pieces with their joints. The Granite's building have some differences from other Throwbots sets that makes a variation an great effect. This set have another awesome feature that is the color scheme, the gray and beige. The visor on the head is nice and alongside with the gray color on some pieces, like on the pickaxes, stay very well. Altough this set is little and with no much playability, play with this is cool. So, i rate Granite 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-27T18:04:19.03Z","My first real set","This is it, my first set, ever! This was in fact a really cool throwbot (the name throw bot is alright, slizer is cooler, but the slizer names weren't as good) named granite (obviously better than &quot;rock&quot;). This one has pickaxes as his weapons of choice. The throwbot arm is more of a tail than an arm, but its position is not bad, in fact it adds to this guy's cool. The four legs are awesome, and the rotating of the axes make him invulnerable from the top as well. The pickaxes also rotate into a nice throwing position... One of the disks shows him firing a laser like beam, but that is most likely the power of the disk itself. For those who think it is a coincedence that the rock looks like a skull, it isn't; One of the disks show him fighting a gaint rock head (quite scary to me when I was little). He is really cool, but one con is that the axes don't reach past the legs, making them useless for horizontal digging, but they can easily be extended, otherwise he seems more of a climbing robot than a digging one, so that is also acceptable compromise.

All in all a great set for any fan, bionicle lovers should give these guys a try!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T17:30:36.983Z","The Rock Lizard of...Someplace","I belive the insiration of this set was a rock lizard. But who knows.
Anyways, as I just said twice already, it looks like a lizard. And that makes him unique. It's faceplate is a nice touch. I really couldn't see him with a regular mask. It's weird, though, that his feet are balljoints. The pickaxes are too small. Maybe he can throw them? The disk thrower is, I guess, his tail. 
Now it's time for a quick-fix. Though I haven't tried it, I'm sure one could put a hand piece in the neck and connect it to the balljoint in he back. Then switch some pieces around and your done. What did this accomplish? He's got a moveble neck now!
Overall, great. Very unique. Definately get him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-29T10:16:55.123Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Granite Review","This is a great figure to have and it's fun to play with, too. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set set can be maneuvered very easily as well. The legs can be moved and if you move the head forwards and/or backwards you'll be able to move the pickaxe. The tail does sviwel and you can use this piece to throw the discs. As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
