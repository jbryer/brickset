"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-01T11:42:40Z","Energy","The fact that this set wasnt as good as the others was made up for by the cool cover art. All these sets were so cool especially the series were the planet cracked apart (blaster, spark and flare sets) and the way there were two equal sides of good and evil. I loved (and still love) the way the discs portrayed some sort of story that was never explained.

All these sets fitted together perfectly with good components, etc. They also had a great range of playability with loads of pros. Pity thse were taken away and replaced with the monsters we now call &quot;bionicle&quot;... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Novelty","2007-08-26T00:21:54.38Z","Energy Slizer","The UK name for this set is simply Energy Slizer.  This Slizer, is one of the only 2 that isn't in a humanoid form (the Turbo/City Slizer is the other) - it is in a flying insect design instead.  The design places the &quot;throwing arm&quot; as the tail of the model, placing it in a rather awkward position to &quot;aim&quot; the disk at an object in front of this slizer, unless a 180-degrees turn is executed.  The colours - purple and black - are interesting and makes it rather visually appealing.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-13T23:36:58.7Z","Energy!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them alot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

This particular model is Electro the Energy Slizer and is the last of the eight originals. Being one of the three original models not in Human like shape he walks on all fours and having his disk launcher as his arm would make it difficult. He takes on an insect style of shape and by pulling and pushing his head, the wings fold in and out, just like a bug taking flight. This models leg joints are on top of each other making him that bit more different to Rock. Also the purple and black colour scheme was a brilliant idea in my opinion as you dont see much purple LEGO, which makes it eye catching and makes him that much more different.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and this particular models dick launcher is his tail. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. These can be referenced with a poster that also came with the model.

If you also own 8504, 8505 and 8506 and combine them with Energy, you can make a second super Slizer that is very different to the first. The instructions are in the back of the normal instructions and are quite easy to follow. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was that bit more challenging. No fault at all for this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colours are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-21T14:40:44.653Z","The Electro throwbot","This is another of the slizers/throwbots lines. As slizer, his name is energy slizer, and as throwbot, electro. His line have more figures than bionicle, but the costs comparing with the newer bionicles have a cheap price. This have a cool color not very included on bionicle, purple. He looks like to some slizers don't being humanoid, but anothers are. This have four paws, and purple pieces that looks like be wings. An arm is included on his back, and can throw a disk, like the older matoran, or some bionicle of 2004. The head was used too in roboriders. He have a visor on it. His line precedes bionicle and roboriders, but some of these have gear system to moves, and the pieces are compatible. He is also playable, have the same shape of paws. Like the others slizers, he includes two discs, with different symbols. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-27T17:33:27.373Z","Zap!","Wow what a Throwbot! This one is actually called Electro in the US, a rather fitting name for a giant insect-like robot! This one has positionable wings that fold with a &quot;long gear&quot; used as the head/neck, so when you pull or push the head, the wings move. The wings do come out, but it takes more than natural force to do that, so you would have to physically pull them  off. The tail is also the throwing arm, a rather cool touch I must say! The visor is really cool since instead of a complex robotic design, it is clear showing the throwbot's true face, which is really fearsome. This is one of my favorite throwbots (jet, amazon, and turbo at the top) and it shows. With the collectable disks (not included) this Throwbot is even cooler!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-03-09T20:18:32.56Z","Electric Slizer (Throwbot) ","I used to own a Throwbot set but I don't remeber which one it was. However, this theme actually had a significant part in the creation of the Bionicle theme. I like the swinging arm which could throw the disc at a target which was cool at the time. Overall, Throwbots or Slizers, was a great theme and should be brought back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy0002","2009-07-01T09:21:31.593Z","got it at a yard sale from an old lady for a dollar!","i picked this up about 4 years ago at a yardsale across the street from some old lady. this was in a box with a few other technicy and bionicle looking things. i cant remeber what else was in it, maybe some knex or something... anyway, since this thing was cheap, this was an awesome set for me. the wings move foreward and backwards and it has alot of neat looking old bionicle syle pieces in purple and back. theres a purple colored mace piece under the wing that i took out to use for my vikings, and that piece is probably really rare! im not a big fan of technic and have never actually made a purchase to buy one(that wasnt from a yardsale), but id still say this robotic dragonfly is way better than most other technicy sets ive seen lately. i didnt know about the disk throwing thing until now so its a good thing i finally got curious and looked this up! this sets awesome, but i doubt youll find it anywhere.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T17:37:51.857Z","Purple bug.","He's definately a bug. He's got a balljointed head (yay!). He also has a transparent facemask. Like Granite, he also has balljointed feet. The wings are very nice, but (on mine at least) they sometimes get stuck or stiff. I guess the disk thrower is a shell or something. Well, I suppose that's all.
Highly recommended. Definatly get him He's a very original.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-29T10:10:52.283Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Electro Review","This is a really cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. The wings of this figure are movable and the legs can be moved as well. You can also sviwel the tail on the back which can shoot a disc. This figure can be maneuvered very easily, too. As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
