"Blade","2007-10-14T05:43:32.717Z","A Great Collectable Item","These were the collectable part of this series and I feel was done very well for the first attempt at it. There were 48 disks in the first release and another seven disks came out with the second release so a grand total of 55 disks to collect. 

Now these disks were very easy to collect as each disk had a power bar showing a number of lights which made it that bit more interesting for children rather than numbers. Also each Slizer came with a poster and on the back of the poster was chart of  half the disks so you could see what you needed to get them all.

Each Slizer had six disks to its colour and they vaguely told the story of each Slizer. The story itself is a lost one but there is alot of speculation on it and more info can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slizer 

I can confirm some of their details are wrong but I dont wish to argue. The only thing I would like to put to the LEGO comunity is I believe the story was posted on LEGO's website as I found the link in a cataloug but it is now out of date. Did anyone else see the site and can confirm the story was there? 

All the disks started at 2/8 lights and worked up to 7/8 lights lit up, with the exception of Judge, who on the final disk had all eight lights lit up instead of seven.

Now if I remember correctly each Slizer came with two disks of their colour and I think they were the first two of each disk on the chart. I never got a double of one of these first two disks which leads me to believe that they weren't put in the supplementary packs.

The final seven disks came with the four new Slizers only so if you own 8520-23 you have them all so dont stress. This made a great addition to the original 48.

Overall I felt these were great and the different pictures telling the story excellent. If you want to collect something really cool within a set, this is the one you want. A 10/10 as a collectable item, 9/10 for accuracy and 10/10 for aesthetics  so yeah full marks from me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

These discs are cool to launch with the Slizers sets, in their hands, and the discs are also awesome designed, with some variations in the colors and symbols. These five assorted discs are really nice and with the sets, playable, to make a great effect. These can too be used to a collection, that can be better for the Slizers sets. But unfortunately two discs are included in all the Slizers sets, so, these on packs have no new features, and five discs without new features are not the best option for weapons. But it still great designed, so, i rate the Slizers' Supplementary Discs 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Though I never actually purcchased a pack, I still have all but three of the original disks (excluding the series two disks) so that counts for something. There were six disks in each color (red, yellow, teal, white, tan, purple, green, and black later colors had glow-in-the-dark and gold as well) each color had a line up of disks, the first was an element symbol, the second was a pose of the figure throwing a disk, the third was a picture of the throwbot's capsule flying, the fourth was an action pose, the fifth was the figure fighting an enemy in their &quot;section&quot; of the divided planet (shown on Jet's sixth disk) and the final disk was a &quot;power source&quot; or an artifact of their zone (these are the hardest to find, and of the originals, the three I don't have are from this section). The newer disks later on are from the four newer sets, the new disks being an action pose from each figure, as well as two meteors (flare and spark) and the image of the three newest throw bots posing in front of fire (blaster). The only gold disk, from the Millenia set, has nine dots instead of eight, an often overlooked difference, since the other disks only have up to eight!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
