(White shirt with dragons on it, black helmet, lord of red and green ninjas, you know that guy?) The other maybe for that red ninja with long beard and circular hat. Anyway, the flip forward action is good, but what is that close in front of this guy that the katanas can do something about, that he can't run right over? If they are for overhead vines, than why not stay in an upright position? So that looks daft, but still, the purpose is sort of unclear. I actuallly don't care that much, just looking into a minor design flaw. This is still worthy of a ten.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-05T06:07:50.31Z","Riding on the swamp","The swamp roborider is one of the most usable, with it's katanas, maded for minifigures, and technic pieces, compatible with bionicle and some system and themes. The wheels have a great color, and some pieces are lime green, liking very that this is in swamp. The combination with lava, using the swamp's head and big wheels on back is easy to build, and, in the end, have great playability. The wheels can be launched, like the other all roboriders. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2009-08-23T18:19:10.137Z","Not the best of the six","This is a good-looking roborider, however, it has an annoying flaw: The swinging swords don't come far enough foward. Roboriders are all simply designed and are predecessors to bionicle, much like throwbots. This particular model can stand on its own, unlike the two wheeled versions that need kickstands.
By pushing down on the handle, the swords will swing forward.

Roboriders also have a wheel launcher in the front, but it does not work very well.

Pros:
-Rare teal katanas
-good design
-cool details
-awesome wheels
-canister with lid
-Lid doubles as giant wheel

Cons:
-katanas don't swing far enough
-rubber bands will eventually disintegrate
-wheel launchers barely work

? You cannot tell from here, but each roborider wheel has a character on it (16 different in total). In the manual each is given a rating of 1-8, but there is no description as to why. Perhaps there was a game intended, but anything left has been lost to time.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-18T08:52:53.307Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Swamp Review","This set looks really cool and it's a fun set to have for sure. The build of this vehicle is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. You can also maneuver this robo rider very easily. On the back you can find a gear which moves the wheels on the back up and down. If you push this vehicle forwards or backwards you can move the swords. I also like the color which LEGO has chosen for this set.  If you want to shoot the wheels you have to slide the piece where you 
can see the wheel on the front out and move it up. As I told you in the 
beginning: It's a great set to have - also for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms 
for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
