Since I received this set in 1980 I almost didn't collect anything other than Technic sets until about 1999. Technically the model is quite simple, but it has loads of play-value. You can easily make all kinds of farming tools, with the parts that came in the set or with your other parts. It is also one of the most charming designs in the Technic-line ever. Even at todays standards this set would be a cool little Designer Set if the rereleased it as such.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-23T14:17:32Z","My First Technic","This was a christmas present in 1977 and it still gives hours of pleasure to nieces and nephews.
I think it is one of the most accurate looking models of all the technic range.
Lego technic sparked imagination and a love of building things that has never left me - I now run a design team creating specialist vehicle conversions.
Top Marks to Lego!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T19:43:46Z","My First Technic Set","This was a great set.  Loved it.  Many many hours playing with it.  One thing I loved about these older sets is that they usually came with a booklet that had new creations when combined with other sets.  But they also had new designes outside of any set which I'd try to recreate or further.  The only problem with this set was that the spinners for the steering eventually became too loose that they wouldn't stay connected to the frame.  Ah well, age tends to do that.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:17:59Z","Tribute to one of the best","This will always be one of my favorite Technic sets. The 851 was my first Technic set. Legos had always been a standard plaything in our family, but building this set in 1981 represented the first time that my Lego imagination became reality. All those interesting parts like gears, axles, and that outstanding universal joint combined with cause-and-effect mechanisms like steering, power to the farm implements, the implement activation lever... WOW. 

And so many different machines to choose from! I built everything shown in the instruction manual the day that I got my 851, and built the models-without-instructions shown on the box (like the steamroller and the combine harvester) soon after. I even built a helicopter out of it one day. Even the box itself was great -- a satisfying heft, good pictures, and if you put the instruction book back in the box cover for stability, the open box made a wonderful ramp for jumping (which assists the demonstration of the 851's only real fault, which is the fragility of the front wheel support and steering mechanism).

The 851 continues to be a great set that holds its value in both the play and financial realms very well.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T21:46:00Z","Wonderful set from long ago","I recieved this set as a young boy and like another reviewer said, it changed my life.  I was always a farm kid and it could possibly be this set that prompted me to become an agricultural engineer designing real farm equipment.
Based on today's standards, the set is pretty simple but 25 years ago things like a working 3-point hitch, rotating PTO, and steerable wheels were great.  The styling of the tractor is also a great copy of Massey Ferguson tractors from that era.  There were instructions for several implements that used the hitch and PTO and creating my own implements was fun too.  The main drawback is the lack of four matched tires to build other models but this is easily cured by combining other sets.  All in all, though, I consider this a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mhoeij","2008-01-21T23:34:18.28Z","Looks exactly like my dad's old Massey Ferguson.","Got this as a kid, and I remember that it looked exactly like
my dad's Massey Ferguson that he had at the time. That's all the more impressive
given the fact that this is done using only classic LEGO pieces.
Even with modern pieces it's very hard to get such close resemblance.

After nearly 30 years, I recently rebuilt it again. My 4 year old (almost 5)
loves to play with it.  I made some changes though.

Replacing the grey 2x3 plate that you find on the bottom in the front of the tractor
by a 2x2 plate drastically reduces the turning radius.

More important, when children play with the tractor, the two bottom lift arms in
the back keep getting loose so that the lever stops working.
This can be fixed by adding two studless technic beams (the ones with 3 holes)
to strenghten the lift arms  (can't use the usual 4x1 technic beams with studs because
that doesn't fit.  Also, to make the studless technic beams fit, you have to replace
in the tractor on both sides a 4x1 red brick by a 3x1 red brick).

With this fix, the tractor now holds up well when my 4 year old plays with it, so I don't
have to keep fixing it. I love the fact that he likes playing with the same thing I enjoyed
playing with almost 30 years ago!
Still, the thing that strikes me the most about this model is how closely it resembles
my dad's old tractor.

"Xwing250","2008-08-28T04:47:25.793Z","What can I Say!","This has to be one of the most detailed sets lego has ever released. My Granda who has Massey Ferguson 165 just like it has seen models with less detail than this. And to be made out lego! 

This has some very interesting features. The mower is amazing, The Pto shaft at the back is impressive and what all lego technic sets should always have, the steering is quite good.

Overall I just have to say How truly wonderful this set is. 10/10! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-06-04T08:06:46.357Z","nice, but not overwhelming","Compared to the great design of the 8859 you miss some details here. The 851 is still a nice set, but has fragile parts and - like in most of the first technic sets - not too much technic included. But well, this is the first generation and deserves a 5/5.

"superjohn","2008-09-18T13:45:11.903Z","My first Technic set - fantastic!","I got this set in the late 1970s, it was my first ever Technic set, having previously been a Legoland kid.  I was so excited, we had to drive all the way to Romford to get it and my dad folded down the back seats of our Escort so I could lay in the boot and start building while he drove home!

I moved on to bigger sets, but this was always a favourite.  Firstly it looks so RIGHT, like a real tractor. If I was being critical, the front ground clearance is far too low for any back garden &quot;off roading&quot; and the front wheels did fall off if you played too fast and hard.

The power take off was fantastic, and you knew you were a real Lego builder if you could get that grass cutting attachment to work!

A really good set, and in a proper box too.

Finally eBay delivered and I'm chuffed with it!</p><p>Although it's a small model it works very well, with smooth steering and a nice over-centre action on the implement lowering lever.

All my friends had the Technical Lego (as it was called then) Forklift, #850, but the Massey was so much more fun, and versatile to play with. I always remember thinking one of the coolest supplementary models was the dragster, where you put the whole smaller wheels inside the large wheel tyres for the rears, and used the large wheel hubs at the front.
