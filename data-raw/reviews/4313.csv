I got all six roboriders for some deal somewhere like thirty U.S. dollars for all six which were worth forty-eight. I never really became a mastermind of firing the front disks though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-07T18:52:45.31Z","Favorite roboriders","My first, and my favorite roborider. The red color is cool, it isn't too darker, and the wheels in orange color are good. It also includes system old axes, great for all minifigure. The designs of the head looks like a power machine. The wheels can be launched easily. This feature aren't present in another lines, like throwbots and bionicle, because they aren't vehicles. Using roboriders as vehicles for other lines is a option of stuff. The combos of the back of the instruction are awesome, but can't find more the instructions for these. In overall, it is a classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The orange wheels are awesome and gives it a fiery feel to this set. I really like this set to this day and it is awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-25T09:34:41.217Z","Feel The Heat!","The set was packaged in a large plastic container which would then pave way to Bionicle and I love creative packaging. However the lava beast inside isn't what it's all nice to be about. It was created with minimal Technic pieces and the final product is nice. The main body of the RoboRider seems to be the brain of the system. I never got around to launching the front disc properly as the instruction says so. Each of the three wheels have a different design on it such as an owl with a buzz saw. The two black axes that are mounted on the RoboRider found a good home into the weaponry of my Castle knights. I think this set would appeal to the Bionicle fans as this is the kind of intelligent creatures in pre-Bionicle ages.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-18T08:57:56.18Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Lava Review","This is a very cool looking robo rider and a great little set to have for sure. It's fun to play with and it's very easy to build as well. We also don't get any stickers to worry about. This vehicle can be maneuvered very easily, too. If you push this robo rider forwards or backwards you can move the axe on each side up and down.  If you want to shoot the wheels you have to slide the piece where you 
can see the wheel on the front out and move it up. As I told you in the 
beginning: It's a great set to have - also for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms 
for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

The axes that swing down, along with the red-hot fire design, is AWESOME.<br><br>The throwing-wheel thingy is (I think) better than any other disk launcher/rocket launcher that has been made.<br><br>P.S. The RR were MUCH better than Bionicle.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
