The magnets are set into the three tubes in the back of each brick, so they still can be used as regular bricks. The only exception is that you can not offset a smaller brick in the center of the underside of the magnet bricks, as the magnets are flush with the bottom. Interestingly, the magnets have been set with the same polarity, so the bricks click together with no problems.

I will happily put these on my fridge and my filing cabinet at home, and attach more lego to them, but I wouldn't put them on a school locker. They would be too attractive and get stolen!
