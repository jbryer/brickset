"Novelty","2007-08-26T00:03:42.753Z","White out","Most of the Roboriders with a firing front wheel has the same built, with only the colours and the accessories varying between them.  Frost is a black and white bike, with transparent blue wheels and spears which gives it the frozen look and is a nice choice from a design point of view.  The only negative about this set is that when the wheel is &quot;launched&quot; the bike stops running as there is no auxillary front wheel in front.  The launchable wheel also means it comes off easily during play when you don't want it to.  Also, access to the front wheel in this is hampered by the position of the blue spears, even when the launcher is pulled out.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-08T11:14:24.95Z","First of my bro","This roborider is one great set, looks somethings different of the roboriders, including the system ice spears as weapons. It also include a gear, the gray with white and the glow blue included in wheels make a great color scheme. Like all of this line, frost include a assortment pack of wheels, with a character designed in each wheel. The system of throw wheel is cool, but the same of other roboriders. The combination is great, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-17T10:14:00.263Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Frost Review","This is a really cool little set and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This vehicle can be maneuvered very easily as well. On the back of this robo rider is a gear which can move the wheel on the back up and down. On each side of this bike you can also find a translucent blue spear. If you want to shoot the wheels you have to slide the piece where you 
can see the wheel on the front out and move it up. As I told you in the 
beginning: It's a great set to have - also for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms 
for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J__B_","2010-06-29T14:46:41.543Z","Great spears","All the RR sets have great, one-of-a-kind weapons that are rarely seen (if at all) in other sets. The blue transparent spears in this set are a good example. (They can be used for undersea creatures, Star Wars holograms, etc.)<br><br>The white pieces that hold the rear wheel are very unique. (As are the white tubes).<br><br>This RR's face is closer to the front wheel, more-so than any other RR.<br><br>RR are SO much better than Bionicle!<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
"KodakKid365","2010-11-30T17:34:33.563Z","Great bike!","The frost bike is awesome! You can spin a gear and its position changes to makke it look different. It has the to cool spears in the front and the front wheel shoots off. It is an overall awesome bike. Yah, I reccomend it to you.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
