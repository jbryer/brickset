It is very usable to creations, the wheels, for all themes that contain wheels, the red pieces as lightsabers, and some pieces to bionicle. The line roboriders overs, but they can be used in all sets, to make it, use the imagination!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-16T10:11:59.213Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Onyx Review","This set is a nice set to have and very fun to play with. This model is an easy build and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. It's also very easy to maneuver this vehicle. This set also has wheels which glow in the dark. If you want to shoot the wheels you have to slide the piece where you can see the wheel on the front out and move it up. There's also a gear which can move the wheel on the back up and down and it also has a laser on each side. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have - also for pieces which you can use for MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
