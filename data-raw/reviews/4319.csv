"Gus_263","2008-02-08T11:23:46.593Z","Have a lot of features","A so cool set, with a good system of weapons, a back different comparing with other roboriders. The color scheme is awesome, having dark gray wheels. Some pieces can be used, as system or technic, this is one playable set, with the throw wheel pieces, a roborider feature. Another feature is the combination with frost and the freezebox code, other feature included in years later by bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-23T18:14:09.937Z","Cool set!","This is one of the Roboriders sets, and is pretty cool, since it has &quot;spear-moving action&quot;! The spears don't move much, but it is still cool, since it allows a shock-like system for the awesome randomly placed wheels! The parts for ths set are pretty cool and allow for som other interesting models to be made, and the throwbots mask is good for collectors. The biggest con is that the rubber band, under constant strain, wears out and eventually snaps like paper! (but rubber bands go through ustightly &quot;shredding&quot; first). The capsule is good for storage, and the top can also be used for a giant wheel, that is great for combo models.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-16T10:17:02.977Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Dust Review","This is a really nice set to have and it's very fun to build as well. We also don't get any stickers to worry about. This vehicle can be maneuvered very easily and it's fun to play with as well. If you push this bike forwards or backwards you'll be able to move the harpoons. If you want to shoot the wheels you have to slide the piece where you can see the wheel on the front out and move it up. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have - also for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms 
for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

However, the Roboriders (along with the Throwbots) paved the way for Bionicle. Anyways, on with the review.  Dust is a tan colored motorbike/robot/alien/computer program thingy composed mainly of Technic pieces. He has a knob on his back that, when turned, does nothing. You've heard (er, read) right. It doesn't do a thing. This guy is also supposed to be able to launch his front wheel. No matter how hard I try, I can't figure out how that is even remotely possible. It doesn't work at all. I'm also annoyed by the strange characters on his wheels. Dust also has a face mask that annoyingly flips up and down. But what saves it from all these Cons? Why did I choose to give it four bricks? Perhaps, this is because of it's ability to THRUST THY FEARSOME SPIKES WHEN PUSHED DOWN! Or, maybe it's just it's overall amazing playability.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
