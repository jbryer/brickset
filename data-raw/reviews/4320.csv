"Blade","2007-08-19T09:10:31.753Z","Blastin Ride","As this is the last robo rider i own to date i figure I'll review him and get the series out of the way. Well Robo Riders was the next step after the end of the Slizer or Throw Bot series. Some People thought they were really good, personally there ok but I feel Slizers were better and to the latter Bionical. Still, not to debate it here but to review. 

Power is not a bad looking bot. The colour scheme of yellow and black looks good and works well with his face. The wheels are the robo rider disks which are the other collectable part of this series. They have a launcher built into the front wheel bracket which just slides out. Personally I really dont like it for two reasons. One I feel it's not the best launching system kinda annoying really and the accuracy isn't that high either. Two once you use the launcher you cant drive the model any more, unlike the Slizers and some of the newer Bionicle.

The Blasters coming out the sides are pretty cool but if pushed in too close to the model can catch on the suspension of the back tire. With these kind of models no real cons unless you count the points made above.

Overall this model is not too bad but I never really liked them as they were kind of a replacement of Slizers which were a favourite of mine as a kid but still overall there a nice model so a 6/10 from me here. A good addition to any technic or robot collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

One of the most playable roboriders, this set have arms, but no weapons. The arms are compatible with all bionicle. With onyx, can be maded one robot-like combination, but it don't are much playable. A cool set, i rate it 5/5. It have yellow and black, good colors.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-17T10:19:09.3Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Power Review","This robo rider looks very cool and it's a great set to have. The build is very easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. This model is very easy to maneuver and to play with as well. The arms on each side can sviwel and they also got a laser. On the back is a gear which moves the wheel on the back up and down. If you want to shoot the wheels you have to slide the piece where you 
can see the wheel on the front out and move it up. As I told you in the 
beginning: It's a great set to have - also for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms 
for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"theotherkevin","2012-03-01T22:45:48.81Z","Power RoboRider review","<p>I got this set way back when and recently rebuilt it while going through some boxes. &nbsp;Completely built, the&nbsp;canister it comes in&nbsp;sorta fits the whole set, and the top can be used as a large wheel for combination models. &nbsp;As the ""basic"" robo rider, it's design is simple compared to the others, but still has the unique feel of a street bike. &nbsp;It's weapon arms are the key difference besides the color scheme, and they are very poseable and don't usually get in the way of turning the wheels. &nbsp;I had to get some replacement rubber bands for the suspension system as they tend to disintegrate after some time. &nbsp;The wheel-throwing mechanism is tricky to use properly, but is pretty cool when you get the hang of it.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Highly pose-able arm/weapons things.</li><li>Collectible&nbsp;wheel characters.</li><li>Nifty working suspention.</li><li>""Head"" piece is very unique and pretty cool.</li><li>Wheel launching system.</li><li>Instructions for combination model with 8512 Onyx.</li><li>Great desk or play toy.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Rubber bands can break easily and will&nbsp;disintegrate&nbsp;over time.</li><li>Wheel thrower is tricky to use and can launch wheels into, uh,&nbsp;inconvenient spots.</li><li>Arms can get in the way of moving wheels.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>All in all, this was a pretty cool set from a very cool series. It's&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;parts, combination models and canister packaging are obvious precursors to the long-running and popular Bionicle series. I used to play with it as a kid, and now it sits on my desk with the rest.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"roboriderfan","2013-12-24T20:21:15.307Z","A fun build.","<p>As a TFOL, my original collection was a $3 Huge box of elements bought at Goodwill. For the longest time, I wondered what a certain piece, which I had a few of, was. It turns out that it is the roboriders wheel housing. I now have mostly rebuilt this set and the 'swamp' set.</p><p>Okay, to the set!</p><p>The build is interesting, and the suspension setup is something that works great, but I never would have thought of it. I like that the worm gear allows you to change the angle of the back wheel assembly, too. Come to think of it, the bike itself, without the weapons, kind of reminds me of something on TRON.</p><p>This is my first review on brickset, so if you read this and notice that something's missing, please ask!</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
