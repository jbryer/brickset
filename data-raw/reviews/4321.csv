Ok, I was never a big Robo Rider fan so I didn't know as much about them as most series, except that the disks were very collectable. I have just finished doing my research over the poor quality information on the net and what I got out of my catalogues. 

Basically about six months after the second series of Slizers came out Robo Riders were released (June 2000). They were motorbike shaped robots designed to fight a virus on the Internet. Each Robo Rider canister has a code on it, which allowed you access to the LEGO website. The Robo Riders combined together to make a super rider. Sound Familiar? Many people thought they were just a rip off of Slizers.

Anyway bout January 2001 Slizers and Robo Riders were out of the current catalogue, Slizers were almost all gone from shelves and Robo Riders seemed to be on the way out. Why? Bionicle had hit stores and it hit with a smash. LEGO realised how much further they could have gone with Slizers but ruined it and scrapped both sets to start again.

The disks themselves are great. There were 16 different disks, with a little robot on each in eight different colours, so a total of 128 unless the the boss has some special ones. Each Robo Rider came with two and this was the way to get the rest. They were an ok weapon for the Riders but made a much better collectable and a list of each disk can be found in the back of the instruction book of each Rider. Overall not a necessity but if you love LEGO and like collecting things these are for you. 5/10. Remember these are basically the second series of collectable items by LEGO.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The pack includes four wheels, with designs of characters and cool color scheme, in assortment. The wheels are launched different comparision with discs, but the systems to launch one can be putted in any technic or too bionicle. Have roboriders that have two wheels and others that have three. For these, four are few. It is a cool ammo, or only wheels, to technic or sometimes lego system.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
