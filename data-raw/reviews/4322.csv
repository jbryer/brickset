"Novelty","2007-08-25T23:57:41.113Z","The Boss","This set is titled &quot;The Boss&quot; in the UK and it is the biggest of the Roborider sets.  There is nothing special about bike itself - it has 2 wheels, a handle bar, etc.  What is special is the flying plane thing with the head of the robot.  This plane has adjustable wings and interesting gun turrents.  What is more interesting is that it can be attached to the bike and the wings folded down to bulk up the bike and make it look rather grand and exciting.  Detached, it's a plane and a bike, attached, it's a grand bike.  The colours on this set has been nicely done - mostly black with orange and grey highlights which makes it looks attractive.  Ultimately, this is the boss of all things roboriders.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Roborider_in_the_sky","2007-09-14T17:27:46.623Z","The Boss","This is a pretty good set to any one who likes technic or the old bionicle. For the few who liked Robo Riders this is great! There are two forms. The one pictured is the main modle and it can make a flying machine and a bike, and combine to make a bigger bike. The second model, which actully uses all the parts, is a 3 wheeled bike, that can split into three two wheelers, one that launces its front wheel. Get it if you can find it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

And boy is this thing boss! The biggest Roborider set ever released, the Boss is an awesome 2-in-1. The model pictured above is not nearly as cool as the alternate you can make, and it's the alternate that I bought the set for. It's got three awesome tires and flame decals. I suggest you look up a picture online. I'll make a pro/con list to keep it simple:

= PROS: =

- 2 models in 1, but you're gonna want to make the alternate. 

- Awesome printed flame decals.

- Awesome printed Roborider face. 

- Alternate model looks great on display.

- The alternate has very functional shocks supported by rubber bands. 

- The wheel-throwing function works better here, since there are other wheels to support the model when the first one is tossed away. 

- Alternate model allows you to adjust the angle of the wheels for cool poses. 

- Includes 3 black Roborider wheels, if you're collecting. 

- Very, very cheap nowadays. I got mine MISB for under ten bucks. That's less than original retail price. 


= CONS: =

- First model is pretty uninteresting. 

- The use of rubber bands means that they'll wear out. They give you extras, but only one. 

- There are a couple of stickers. This is standard nowadays, but this set came out back in 2000. 



I loved Roboriders as a kid, and this set was the king of Roboriders. Say what you will about the theme, but this set was epic. It's got the look of a dangerous, industrial machine that you don't want to mess with. Reminds me of the good ol' days, when Technic made canister sets as subthemes! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-22T19:13:15.263Z","Also named &quot;the Boss&quot;","In a catlog i saw the same set named as &quot;the boss&quot;, but i never found that. This is basically a motorcycle, like one builted with the milennium slizer pieces and with another part, to like a plane, with roboriders' pieces and a visor, with a different design. The colors are cool, having too orange, black, and gray. The pieces are useful, to bionicle and the themes that preceded it. Is strange to combine the motorcycle with the plane, but they separate or not are awesome. One thing isn't included, the wheels with designs that can be launched, of the six firsts roboriders. But still great with or without these. A great thing for make technic, robots, or upgrade bionicle, i rate this 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-25T08:38:45.837Z","LEGO Technic (Robo Riders) - Super RoboRider Review","This set is a cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to put on. The 'head' can be removed from the motorcycle and on each side is an orange piece which can move the wings of this vehicle. On the bike you can see a gear which can move the tyre on the back up and down. I can't complain much about this set. As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have. Even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
