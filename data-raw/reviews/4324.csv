Anyways, he could have some more bulk on the body...he looks puny with a regular Throwbot body. Also, though I don't see how LEGO could have done it, but I would have liked it better if you could fold up a few parts, and convert him from biker to 'Big Mode' without rebuilding.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Roborider_in_the_sky","2007-07-24T11:42:14.817Z","Ultamate slizer!","I got this set off ebay. The total part pile looked very small. This will fool you, it is really big when built. If you do build the main model then you will have many extra parts. If you want to keep him this way those are good extra parts. Most of those are used in the motorcycle mode. I personally prefer the motorcycle and rider because the little guy is eaiser to pose, and Thre are only 3 extra parts. I do wish he could change to his cycle, and back without rebuilding him, but how is beyond me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-09T03:15:44.2Z","A Must Have 2 Of!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them allot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

Second I wish to give some background into the story. Their were eight Slizers to start with inhabiting the Slizer planet. On new year's eve a meteor hit the Slizer planet. The collision was so powerful that half the planet was blown to pieces. Out of the ashes four new Slizer mutants were born. The four tried to take control of the planet but four of the original Slizers survived (8500, 8501, 8502 and 8503) and they started to battle. This is a word for word snippet released by LEGO. So new Slizers or mutations of the old four left unclear, but still really cool to play with.

This particular model is Millennium and he is by far my favorite. He is one of the best robots LEGO have ever released. He has two really cool forms which is why you need two. One is a standard size Slizer that rides a wicked as motorbike. The other is a giant super sized Slizer. This model also had an alter ego, to introduce the millennium idea into LEGO and children. His main enemy that is not a Slizer is a green fungus/slime based thing, all over the city domain. I believe it was the millennium bug and he was to destroy it.

In either form both of his arms are disk launchers, which only two Slizers have and Blaster has two on one arm, but with Judge gone it makes him special. His face is also unique as it is symmetrical, unlike the original ones and bares no resemblance to any other. His colors are gray and black but also having red and a golden head piece. He comes with only 1 disk, a golden one with nine power lights, the most powerful disk made. Only available with this set.

In super form he looks a bit off center with his legs, if you follow the book. I found simply turning the hip socket 90 degrees, the straightening up the leg legs, he becomes a bit taller and allot straighter, making him look allot better. He also has some form of wings, not that i think they do much. His legs look bulk as and are excellent for kick attacks. No only dose his body pivot on a gear system like most the Slizers, he has chest and leg armor.

In small form he is built like a normal Slizer with two throwing arms and wings or armor, I'm unsure. The color scheme is gray and black. The motorbike looks really cool, you can steer the bike as the handlebars and forks turn. Their is also a place either side of the back tire for a throwing disk and it clips in quite nicely. The bike is red and black. This model dose not have a fusion like all the rest, but I feel he is too powerful to fuse and dose he need to?

Overall this model has no faults (If you overlook the STICKERS) but endless possibilities. It's aesthetics are great and playability by itself or with other Slizers is good too. I feel this model is a true 10/10 and really helped other robot series from this point. A must have two of for any LEGO fan or collector",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"1999thomasb","2007-12-09T18:00:41.873Z","A bit basic.","ok it is alot like a bioicle. it is cool set, but i say the best set is the visrak. and i give it a 5 out of 5 for the parts the set box all of it,I say it is best set in the world! it is a must have set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-21T15:04:51.53Z","The rider throwbot","This is a cool throwbot, perhaps the best. It was included with another box on another countries, perhaps another model with the same pieces, riding a motorcycle. In the form of this box, it looks like taller than the smaller throwbots, but no taller than blaster, another boxed throwbot. Some features were included on this millennium slizer, like the gold head(it don't shine very)and the wheels, that were used too to make a motorcycle as throwbot. The arms that can launch discs are too included. I had wanted for it when a little child, but now i can't find it, this is more smaller than the newer bionicle, but still great. The red parts were included too in the throwbot version, to make a motorcycle, and with it, the figure was smaller. But small with a motorcycle or great without a motorcycle, all still awesome, i rate it 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T18:05:09.047Z","Get 2","Motorcycle: Well, it's a motorcycle. Its got two wide tires, and it's also very bulky. Sadly, though when put Millenium on it prevents the front from spinning, so it can't turn. It can also hold oth disks on the back of the bike.
Millenium: Not very original. The wings are the most eye-catching part about him, but there isn't much.
Titan. Pretty decent. The wheel feet are very unique, and I love 'em. Though his upper legs are kinda small compared to them. The gear function is in his mid-section and uses that wonderful small gear. His chest is made of two feet of a regular Slizer set. He also has wings on the back. And he's got 2 disk throwing arms. His head doesn't have much articulation, just wobbles side to side. Again a slightly unsymmetrical faceplate. One thing I don't understand: Why does he have those horns?
Very great. My hands are tired from typing reviews so I'll leave you with this: Get him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2013-07-09T09:19:39.153Z","An Extraordinary Slizer...","<p>Millennium, also called Millennia, is a one of a kind <i>Slizer</i> set. Along with Blaster, he is the largest of the line's sets, but unlike his enemy, Millennium can be converted into both a large robotic titan and a regular Slizer figure riding a motorbike.</p><p>He comes with two special disks with the power level of 9 (the highest). One is colored gold, as is his head, adding to his uniqueness -- be warned, though, these are only painted.<br></p><p>The titan is probably his more famous form.  It's very bizarre-looking. Though constructed around the usual Slizer ""gearbox"" torso, it towers over most other Slizers thanks to its immense legs and unique upper body built. The feet, made up of giant tires and huge armor plates, possibly simulating rocket-boosters or the like, are in stark contrast with his twig-like thighs and wimpy arms. The prong-like ""wings"" on his back add some complexity to his upper body, but they're purely decorative.</p><p>Articulation-wise, his head, decorated with horns and headlights, swivels from side to side. The torso can be rotated up and down, as opposed to most other Slizers who could only rotate their head and arms. The legs have hip and knee joints but sadly no feet joint, limiting his poses. He has two disk-throwing arms, so while they are limited in movement, they at least make him symmetrical. The back wings can be positioned up or down, and as their connector piece can be spun around, they can also be made to look like propellers.</p><p>Although I think it's the more imaginative form out of the two, the titan looks weak in many places, with his weedy limbs and several rod pieces simply sticking out of his legs. My biggest gripe is that it leaves out a ton of pieces. The leftover parts can get lost if you don't put them in a safe place. This is a shame, because those parts could have been used to give Millennium some actual wings or even a weapon. All in all, the titan is really, really obviously just an afterthought, as the bike form makes better use of the pieces and looks altogether better thought-out.<br></p><p>The motorbike is definitely more solid in its design, but not as memorable-looking. The small Millennium Slizer is nothing special -- the gray and black colors are dull, but at least his golden head and cape-like shoulder armor make him stand out from the rest of the Slizers. Sadly these armor pieces greatly limit his gear-function, not allowing him to look up.</p><p>The bike itself is a fair <i>Technic</i> vehicle. The wide tires lend it stability and make it look powerful. It rolls fine and the front wheel can be steered. The rider sits on it firmly but his hands sadly inhibit the steering. The bike has storage places for the two disks, which hold them securely even if the plastic has to be strained a bit to click them into place. As a whole, the bike is very simplistic and not all that great, more like decent. My biggest complaint is that the fuel-tank area is hollow and empty. Could have been filled out with something...<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>You don't like one form, well don't be sad, there's another one!<br></li><li>Special disks<br></li><li>The titan is large and makes a good foe for Blaster<br></li><li>No other Slizer character has a bike, though it <i>can</i> be ridden by other Slizers or even some later <i>BIONICLE</i> figures, who are more in scale with the thing</li><li>The bike can store the disks<br></li><li>Both forms stand stable due to the giant tires<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only one form can be built at a time<br></li><li>The titan has many odd design choices and doesn't incorporate all the pieces<br></li><li>Kinda boring bike<br></li><li>Limited articulation for the smaller Millennia</li><li>The bike can't be steered if Millennia's riding it</li><li>Stickers!<br></li></ul>So there... one solid but boring bike and one giant robot that looks like it's been slapped together. You get to choose which one to build.<br><p>Honestly, it's not that good of a set, but it's unique among the <i>Slizer </i>figures, and the character is also cool -- to a fan like me, that's what mattered most. Since many people demand insane prices for the set, I still think it's better to think twice before grabbing one.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-07T10:23:06.88Z","LEGO Technic (Sllizer) - Millennium Slizer Review","This is a fun set to have and a fun set to play with as well. The build is a lot of fun and we also get a few stickers to put on. This Technic (Slizer) set comes with a slizer figure and a motorcycle which are very easy to maneuver as well. The figure has a gear in the middle which can be used to move the head and the arms up and down. Both arms are able to shoot the discs as well and the figure can fit on the motorcycle very easily as well. The steering wheel of the motorcycle can sviwel as well and on each side you can put the discs which come with this set.    As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
