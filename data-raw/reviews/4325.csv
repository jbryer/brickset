"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-01T11:50:10Z","Flare was my favourite","I think this was the best slizer (apart from maybe the millenium slizer). I think he was created when rock and fire slizer combined in the explosion. The new storyline of the planet being torn apart and the slizers melded together should have been an amazing plot to make a great range, but they only made three sets (flare, turbo and blaster),then the millenium slizer and then got bored, made the roboriders (which were pretty cool too), scrapped them and then created &quot;bionicle&quot;.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-14T06:26:42.843Z","Flare!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them allot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

Second I wish to give some background into the story. Their were eight Slizers to start with inhabiting the Slizer planet. On new year's eve a meteor hit the Slizer planet. The collision was so powerful that half the planet was blown to pieces. Out of the ashes four new Slizer mutants were born. The four tried to take control of the planet but four of the original Slizers survived (8500, 8501, 8502 and 8503) and they started to battle. This is a word for word snippet released by LEGO. So new Slizers or mutations of the old four left unclear, but still really cool to play with.

This particular model is Flare. His bright orange color makes him really stand out and looks great with the black. He has big wings which look great and can come in handy for battle as a weapon or a shield. He also has ski's for feet, like Ice. His face looks like no other Slizer and is symmetrical which  is different to all the original. 

All Slizers have a disk launcher and this particular models dick launcher is his tail. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. Their were seven disks released with the second generation of Slizers and two came with this model, two and five power lights.

If you also own 8522 and 8523 and combine them with Flare, you can make a third super Slizer that is very different to the first two. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was a bit more challenging. No fault at all for this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not Technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colors are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:36:46.14Z","Flare","This set is a set from the Throwbots theme, also called Slizers theme. Flare have like all from the theme, a different building, that consists in some old and small pieces from the technic before bionicle, but also still great designed, builted and have a considerable playability. With a cool color scheme that have orange and black, Flare also have a visor with some designs that makes a nice effect. The pieces are all useful and it looks like to have wings. Like all the throwbots, this includes two discs and can launch them from the arm. In the flare, the arm is on the back, due to his form, is good positioned. Overall, the set is great but simple. So, i rate Flare 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T17:54:32.263Z","Guess What? I don't know, but it's a cool figure!","I agree with myself. This is a great set. He's very bird-like. As all of these sets are, the face mask isn't symmetrical. You can make him stand up, but he kinda looks akward when he does. The orange is an amazing color and works well with him. His tail is the disk thrower and is apparently a stabilizer for flying. Very unique.
Get him? Of course! This set has it all: cool colors, uniquness, and a great feel to him. 5/5, recommended, get him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-25T19:09:50.56Z","Cool figure.","I got this at a store that sells old legos. I had heard of Slizers before, and I though they were worth getting. This set has old, rare pieces and can move it's head and wings upward by twisting it's disk-throwing tail. The disk arm is very flex-able and can throw disks about less than ten feet away. 

pros:
disk arm.
rare pieces.
cool function.
pose-able.

cons:
None

In all an okay Slizer, but if you want more pose-ability, I think you should get a different one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T21:55:20.067Z","Throwbots or Go-Bots?","<p>Set #8521 Flare: Before Bionicle LEGO introduced Throwbots (Slizer in Europe) the backstory of these guys... remains forgotten by me. But they did have some sort of backstory, unfortunately the mythos of the Throwbots didn't pick up as well as Bionicle did and so LEGO went back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I picked up two of them from a local Canadian retail outlet that was selling them at a clearance. I was interested in seeing what these LEGO robots looked like. Flare was built with some standard Technic pieces and a few rare to the Throwbots pieces. He was orange and black with grey parts and could change himself from a standing form into the flying mode pictured above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gimmick of the Throwbots didn't involve masks, but flingable disks with flexible arms to launch them. The disks were their weapons. I liked Flare, but the set was one that I let go during the big Purge simply because I needed more space. The LEGO Throwbots idea however bold it was just couldn't match up to the desired expectations of the mythos, in a way Throwbots are the equivalent of Tonka's Go-Bots where Bionicle is the equivalent of Hasbro's Transformers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this set was pretty nifty looking and a great set for Mecha enthusiasts who wanted to build LEGO robots. They are also deserving of a second look, just because they weren't as popular as Bionicle doesn't mean they weren't good sets. Many of them had unique body designs and started LEGO on the path to Bionicle, so for that alone these sets are worthy of existing.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-28T10:10:07.03Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Flare Review","This set is a great set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. We also get a disc which glows in the dark. The legs, the feet and the wings can move and the gear in the middle moves the head up and down. You can also use this gear to move the tail on the back which you can use to shoot the disc. It's a cool set to have for sure - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
