The only sets that could beat this (in slizer) are millenium slizer, blaster and flare. I loved this one especially because it was a great improvement and was a fusion of ice, city and energy slizer.

<p>In my opinion the most well put together of all the throwbots/slizers. I wanted to get this guy but when I got the chance I was shocked,not by Sparky, but by the fact that they were discontinued. I hope Lego brings these little guys back!</p>

"Blade","2007-11-14T08:39:11.043Z","Spark!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them allot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

Second I wish to give some background into the story. Their were eight Slizers to start with inhabiting the Slizer planet. On new year's eve a meteor hit the Slizer planet. The collision was so powerful that half the planet was blown to pieces. Out of the ashes four new Slizer mutants were born. The four tried to take control of the planet but four of the original Slizers survived (8500, 8501, 8502 and 8503) and they started to battle. This is a word for word snippet released by LEGO. So new Slizers or mutations of the old four left unclear, but still really cool to play with.

This particular model is Spark. His color scheme is purple and black which I felt was a bit of a rip off of energy. I feel he should have been a new colour but in the spirit of mutation I am living with it.His weapon is a wing or shield that is a blaster or rocket launcher. He has a wide stance in his legs and his shoulders are very broad, making him look tough. His face is almost symmetrical and is very different to the originals but doesn't have the same class as Millennium or Flare.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and this particular models dick launcher is his right arm. The disk launcher is very accurate considering and the carry case is an excellent goal but also a good spot to put all your extra disks. Also looking back the first of the robot kind (Slizers) fold down quite nicely into their carry box. Sound familiar?

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. Their were seven disks released with the second generation of Slizers and two came with this model, three and four power lights. Also his and Flare's (8521) disks glow in the dark.

If you also own 8521 and 8523 and combine them with Spark, you can make a third super Slizer that is very different to the first two. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was a bit more challenging. No fault at all for this model and I for one am glad. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not Technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colors are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10.

"Gus_263","2008-03-21T14:52:12.7Z","Throwbot of 2000","This throwbot, spark, like flare, are from the second year of slizers(knew as throwbots on US or in another countries like Brazil),and this feature too a cool color rarely included, the purple, combined with black to make a good effect. He throw discs, too, with the same arm piece of some of his line. The feet were later used in bionicle, like the piece on his right arm. The line preceded the roboriders, and them the bionicle. All were named too to be of technic, in the begin. The body when completed looks like something with the toa mata's body, and it is cool, because the slizers can move with gear systems also. I rate this action throwbot 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-28T17:48:12.2Z","A New Addition to the Collection","Like I said, he's one of my newest Throwbots. 
He's very good, a great set. He's got the same cannon/shield as blaster. His disks also glow in the dark. He's got an almost symmetrical facemask, but it is slightly unsymmetrical (is that a word?). He's kinda unoriginal, though, but that doesn't matter. He's also purple! But sadly his box is also the same color as Electro's, so I'm constntly getting them confused. Really, that's all there is to say about him.
Overall, another great Slizer set. If only they continued. I recommend getting him wherever you can find him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2009-12-22T18:42:32.937Z","Purple?!??! AGAIN!??!!? Awesome.","This guy was the second throwbot of my favorite color, purple. I also think he has the coolest power, HE CAN SUCK ENERGY OUT OF ENEMIES! ISN'T THAT AWESOME!?, well I think it is. But if you don't, he can also use his weapon as a kinda bulky blade or a sheild. His Visor looks awesome too.

Well now for then Cool/Not Cool things about this set.
Purple(+1)
Cool Power(+2)
Cool Visor(+1)
Throws Disk(+2)
Disk Glows In the Dark(+1)

Now For Spark's Grand Total... 6/5!!
Awesome buy it if you can get it for cheap enough.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2010-06-13T14:02:08.687Z","Nice colors, but a bit basic","<p>I have to be honest, while I like the set overall, I can't help but notice how absurdly unoriginal he is. He's built like a basic, first wave Slizer set, which sets him apart from the other sets that came out during the ""Mutant"" era. In this regard, he is nothing new.</p><p>When we look past the build, however, we have a fine set on our hand. His colors, although Electro/Energy from the first line already used them, are highly special, since purple has become a very rare hue since the set came out, especially within Slizer's successor theme, Bionicle. Thus he is regarded by most fans and collectors as a valuable figure. Unfortunately, the hue of his right arm differs noticeably from the color of his torso.</p><p>Another thing I like about his looks is the pattern of his faceplate. It looks very menacing, and a lot less busy than those of other Slizers.<br></p><p>Since his build is so plain, it doesn't feature any problems that an unusual construction would cause (like in Turbo's case). While not symmetrical, he looks good, and since his head sits low between his shoulders, he has the smaller kind of gear holding it in place, unlike some other models that have an absurdly huge gear sticking out of their torso. This also allows his head to be moved more easily.</p><p>His other weapon besides the disk throwing arm is some kind of flattened blaster. I have a hard time believing it acts as an offensive tool, since it doesn't look like anything, on its own. They could have added a few decals or translucent pieces to make resemble a weapon better.</p><p>The two disks he comes with also explain why the set is held in high regard by some. What makes them so interesting is that they are made of glow-in-the-dark plastic. These of course became extremely common after Bionicle began re-using the pieces in '04, but in the Slizers' time, they were considered something new.</p><p>All things considered, Spark is a very nice set on his own, but his unoriginal build and questionable choice of weapons mean I can't give him a maximal rating. Still, if these don't bother you, I'm sure you will find the set perfect.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-28T10:16:00.03Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Spark Review","This is a cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. We also get a disc which glows in the dark. The legs, the feet and the arms of this figure can be moved and in the middle of the torso you can see a gear which can move the head up and down. One arm has a shield and the other one is able to shoot the disc. As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have for sure - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
