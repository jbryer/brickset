"Blade","2007-11-23T20:45:36.67Z","Blaster!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. The Slizers or (Throw Bots) were the pioneers in what was to be a long line of robot looking models. At first glance they look strange, but I grew to really like them allot. Small, with thin limbs, but the joints that held tight, to today and took a good thrashing.

Second I wish to give some background into the story. Their were eight Slizers to start with inhabiting the Slizer planet. On new year's eve a meteor hit the Slizer planet. The collision was so powerful that half the planet was blown to pieces. Out of the ashes four new Slizer mutants were born. The four tried to take control of the planet but four of the original Slizers survived (8500, 8501, 8502 and 8503) and they started to battle. This is a word for word snippet released by LEGO. So new Slizers or mutations of the old four left unclear, but still really cool to play with.

This particular model is Blaster. His color scheme is yellow and black which I felt was a bit of a rip off of Judge. I feel he should have been a new color but in the spirit of mutation I am living with it. This one is the biggest reason for the mutation thing. Firstly his face is half Jungle, half Judge. He is the same color as Judge and his black disk shows, what looks like them mutating. His other weapon is a shield/ blaster piece which fits the name. His body is unlike all the other Slizers being of a different style, different make and a size like Millennium in Super form. Sweet thick movable legs and lots of bulky armor up top are just make his look cool as.

This Slizer is the only one with fault. The main this being his feet. He can't stand up. They are designed to move like an ankle, but they aren't tight. I have studied the book and looked at all possibilities to change, but the only way to do it is remove the four bar on each foot and replace with two black pins (one on each side of the foot so four all up) like the one used to hold his gun in place. I can't see why LEGO would do this! Can someone help hear? The other thing I didn't really like is they way they pack his body out with a spare disk. It's alright but they could have done better like they did with Millennium.

All Slizers have a disk launcher and this particular model has a duel disk launcher on his right arm. He is one of three Slizers released with duel disk launchers (Judge and Millennium being the other two) but he is the only one to have two on the one arm. The pair of disk launchers are very accurate even though they may not look it.

The other great thing about this line is the disks themselves. They are all individual with different pictures and little dots in a power bar round the side so you know what you need. Their were seven disks released with the second generation of Slizers and two came with this model, a black one with six power lights and a yellow one with seven.

If you also own 8521 and 8522 and combine them with Blaster, you can make a third super Slizer that is very different to the first two. I have made the model before and would recommend trying to build it too as it was a bit more challenging. One other thing I found funny is as a kid i thought they should have been made from bricks not Technic and now look what we have ... (coughs) Exo-Force (coughs)...

Overall it's a great model that has lots of playability and gave me endless hours of play and when combined with the others, game could last days, even weeks. The colors are perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. I feel this model and its brethren set the bench mark for future robots and is well deserving of an 8/10. If you love robots start your collection at the beginning, right here.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T19:03:41.547Z","Blaster ","This set is one of the old throwbots, also called slizers. This set is the most big from them and one of the most cool. Like all the other throwbots theme, this have no much playability like the bionicle and is not much tall like the bionicle titans. But it still cool, really cool. The pieces are so much useful, the color scheme is awesome, the building is also cool as the playability, not the best, but nice. With some old pieces related with bionicle, this set still one of the best of throwbots. This also features a double disc launcher, that looks like more arms or spears, and also two good designed discs. Overall, Blaster is a useful set, with nice color scheme, also playability and is cool to play with. I rate, so, Blaster 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2010-06-09T13:51:41.623Z","A bit flawed but still great","<p>How could I describe this guy best? To a collector who's been through many, more advanced sets, he might seem messy and primitive. And that was my first impression too. But looking back at the models that came out around the time, and also at the other Slizer sets, he is without doubt most impressive. In fact, I believe he's one of the best models to have came out from the short-lived line.</p><p>He stands tall, looks bulky and quite menacing, and thanks to his size, can do a lot more things than an average Slizer. His gimmicks aren't all that spectacular, though -- he can look up and down by turning a knob on his back or on his chest, and has two disk throwing arms, mounted on his right hand. I assume (as have others) that they form some sort of staff or cane. They can still move freely and be snapped into other positions, of course, like regular throwing arms.<br></p><p>He comes with two disks to shoot. Or if you'd like to keep them safe instead, he has a little storage place on his stomach: a swinging ball-joint socket between his legs, held up by a rubber band that helps to secure the disk, which in turn fills up the large, gaping hole in his mid-section. On the downside, it's only capable of storing one disk at a time (the other can be kept in the launcher), and without the disk, he does look awkwardly skeletal and empty.</p><p>His other weapon besides the throwing arms is a large plate-piece held in his left hand, the same kind he has on his shoulders. It... doesn't look like anything in particular, so it's up to you what you view it as. It's awfully small for a shield, so it must be a projectile-launching weapon of some sorts. It swings around in his hand a lot, there is no ""official"" way for him to hold it, as fas as I know.</p><p>Other parts of him that tend to be loose are his arms and shoulder panels. This allows for a wider range of movement, but adds a flimsy feel to the set which I'm not sure I like.</p><p>The biggest annoyance is, however, is the fact that his feet don't lock into place and flop around. Thus, it can be difficult to make him stand upright. You need to tilt his lower legs forward a bit. This way, he is pleasantly stable.</p><p>His thighs are also built quite interestingly. Instead of one sturdy beam or arm-piece, there are two Slizer arms connecting his lower legs to his torso. He doesn't have actual knees, but these arms make it possible to move his legs into a variety of positions. They can move forward, backward, and can even be painfully twisted and folded to the side. I don't know whether I like this solution or not... the legs seem absurdly weird, especially with the huge gaps in them.</p><p>They can also be connected to form a huge barely movable block for whatever reason. What was your idea behind that, LEGO?<br></p><p>He retained the yellow and black color-scheme of his former self, Judge, or at least we can only assume that was his former self -- half of his face-plate has Judge's pattern on it, and the other half belongs (or once belonged) to Amazon. The colors of the latter are not represented, however, and Blaster looks like a giant, beefed-up, although flightless version of Judge. As for who those other Blasters we see on one of his disks could be... LEGO never really made that clear. But hey, lets use our imagination, right?</p><p>His two disks also share these colors, and depending on which one you put into his ""pouch"", you can make either yellow or black dominate his color-scheme.<br></p><p><br></p><p>What do I think of this set overall? I know it has a lot of faults: flimsy limbs, pieces that attach loosely, awkward leg and torso design... but for some reason, I like the set a lot. It's the same with all the Slizers for me. They look strange and not all that well constructed, but I still like them. They have a certain charm that's difficult to put your finger on.</p><p>Do I recommend getting Blaster? If you can see the aforementioned charm, or are a Slizer/Bionicle/LEGO robot collector, then sure. He also has a lot of nice pieces, and yellow isn't such a common color anyway, so it can be worth buying him for the parts only. Although an old and rare set, he tends to show up at times on auction sites, and I hear some stores still have him. If you manage to find him under a decent price, get him. I know I did, and was surprised how cheap he was. To compare, the small Bionicle and Hero Factory impulse sets cost the same, and those have very few parts and features and their building experience is also nothing to be excited about. Blaster was well worth the money.</p><p>My final rating for this set is 4 out of 5. As said, I like it, but all the little faults add up to one whole negative point. Still a good set, especially for a Slizer.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Kalhiki","2009-07-16T09:24:42.78Z","Magnificent!","One of the coolest slizer around (besides ski temperature wise), blaster is amazing! sadly, though, I don't think he's available anywhere. this goes for flare and spark too which prevents me from completing my collection. 

Anyways, he has a cool walking stick/double disk launcher (he seems like an old man so I make it double as awalking stick). his shield, which I think is something similar to Spark's weapon, is a little small but still nice when thinking of it as a weapon. 

The shoulder armor looks better facing down in my opinion. Also, keep the disk in his chest. It covers up gaps and holds in well. The face plate is a little weird because the eyes are offset, but it's supposed to be a fusion of two face plates (Amazon and Jet).

Finally there are the legs. They have 2 connections which remind me of the Toa Kaita (Bionicle). For some reason they have the ability to connect, which I don't see the point of. I keep them seperate. The feet are probably the worst part and that's only because they're floppy and makes him hard to stand up, but it doesn't bother me much.

Overall... I'd give 4.8/5. Mainly because of the feet and the length of time it takes to angle his head. And there you have it. Blaster.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2010-07-18T00:05:27.71Z","Best of the Throwbots.","<p>Out of the Throwbots, I like Blaster the best. If you are thinking about buying a Throwbot, I'd say buy Blaster.</p><p><br></p><h4>Build</h4><p>The build is simple, but does not take to long so you won't be bored. His upper body is basically a buffed form of the basic throwbot build. For no apparent reason, his arm pieces are backwards from the conventional throwbot arms. His left arm is armed with a staff made of two opposite facing throwing arms and his right arm is armed with a cannon-thing. His lower body is attached to the spot on his torso where the legs would attach on an ordinary throwbot. The lower body is basically a conglomeration of <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=32174"">basic socket connectors</a> to attach the legs to. The legs are made of upside-down standard throwbot torsos attached to the legs by <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=32173"">throwbot limbs</a>.</p><p>The completed set looks very solid and menacing. He is taller than any of the other throwbots, including Millennia. The model is not very ""good-looking"" or ""asthetically pleasing"", in fact he looks ugly, but this does not detract. I think the he was designed to be a bulky, ugly machine, not sleek like Millennia or sinister like the Bionicle bad-guy titans.&nbsp; The part that detracts from his appearance is the weapon in his right hand. I'm not sure what it is supposed to be, but I guess it's a gun, I don't like it because it looks like it was just thrown on the model because it needed another weapon. It would have been better if the designer had taken the time to build a multi-part cannon for Blasters second weapon instead of throwing this piece on and calling it good.<br></p><p><br></p><h4>Playability <br></h4>Blaster is highly poseable, a feature which already makes him fun to play with, but the most fun feature is the throwing feature. This is one of the most fun and easiest to use launching functions released by the LEGO company. To throw the disk, you bend the throwing arm back and then release. The disk flies very far, but not quite strait, making it more fun to try and aim and hit targets. Another fun play feature is the fact that you can store a disk in his body. It covers up the hollow point between his legs and his upper body, and held in by a rubber band. It's easy to take out or put back in, so that's not a problem. Why is that a fun play feature? Because then he can be holding both of the disks included in the set and you don't have to hold one while your carrying him around!<br>The only thing that detracts from the playability is the feet. The are not held in by a stiff connection, which makes them flop and consequently makes Blaster fall over unless he is balance just right or he is using his staff as a cane.<br><br><h4>Parts</h4>The parts for this set are good but not great for building with. He comes with a lot of yellow, which is fairly versatile for building yellow Bionicles. His visor is well-done and makes a good face. The right half of his face resembles Jet's and the left half is identical to Amazon's, which is highly asymmetrical but very cool looking and creates nice effect. Other than that, there's not a whole lot to say about his parts.<br><p></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T13:57:34.71Z","Blaster wasn't he the Autobot Boombox?","<p>Set #8523 Blaster: This is the second of only two Throwbots sets I once owned and I consider this one to be the weaker of the two, but perhaps that is due to his size compared to the rest of the Throwbots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blaster is a larger Throwbot compared to the rest, he came in a box set rather than the small carrying cases that the other Throwbots possessed. His build is also unique among them in that you are building up a lot more comparatively to the other Throwbots as well. However bigger in this case doesn't mean better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blaster was awkward to store, un-aesthethically pleasing on display and all around not as impressive as the larger Bionicle sets looked. (Having never owned a larger Bionicle set I can't be sure about it, but their pictures tended to look more solid compared to this set.)</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, Blaster is an ambitious model, his feet use toros pieces we would come to expect in Bionicle and he's just full of quirky Technic pieces with odd styles, but the primary model called Blaster you can build with those pieces isn't very good looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd say this set was more useful for building MOC Throwbots or just doing crazy kitbashes using the parts. Especially since it includes two disc flinging arms and two discs for launching. I was never quite sure though why LEGO had you use an elastic rubber band to hold the second disc against his stomach, perhaps it was meant for storage when not in use or perhaps it was just another wierd and unusual design choice for this model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall Blaster isn't much fun to play with, not like the smaller more condensed Throwbots. But he is a great source of material for Throwbot/Slizer parts in yellow and black and I bet you could use these parts in a lot of creative and different ways if you didn't want to build up the main model. He's recommended for that purpose alone because honestly he doesn't make for a very fun Throwbot to play with. Or even to display on the shelf, he is a 'work in progress' from LEGO who's early attempts at making Technic Mecha sometimes fell short, but with a bit of improvisation you could get something wicked looking out of them.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-06T10:09:27.117Z","LEGO Technic (Slizer) - Blaster Review","This is one of my favourite LEGO Technic (Slizer) figures. This set is an easy build and it's also a lot of fun to play with. We also don't need to worry about stickers. This figure is very easy to maneuver as well. The arms and the legs can be moved and one arm has a shield. The other arm has a double-sided arm which can shoot the discs. You can keep one of them in the front of the torso. The torso has a gear which moves the head and arms up and down as well.    As I told you in the beginning: It's a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or
