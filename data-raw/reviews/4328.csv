For what it's worth, I say pick it up.</p><p><br></p><p>Pros:</p><p>2 random colored masks</p><p>1 head and eye piece</p><p><br></p><p>Cons:</p><p>None<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must have bought at least five of these little buggers, the price was right and collecting various masks for the original six Toa was a blast. But you didn't just get masks for the Toa there were others included as well, from the smaller figures and the animals I think. The real reason for buying this set and more specifically multiples of this set, is to collect all six Toa masks in all six Toa colors. (I think Gali and Onua wound up with the most alternate masks in their colors when all was said and done in my collecting phase.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Accessories go this little set is a great addition for Bionicle lovers, especially if you want to swap out Gali's mask with Lewa's mask, but have her wearing a blue version of Lewa's mask so the colors don't clash. I'm not sure if I can actually recommend buying this up, since it was blind packed you might have an easier time these days just hunting for sellers selling the loose Kanohi masks. Still, if you like the thought of randomly getting something and not knowing what it is until you open it, picking up a sealed one might just be fun.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4
