"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-03T10:23:03Z","The most classic Technic set of all time!","I received this set for my Birthday when it came out in the late 1970's.  Although subsequent supercars had more functions etc, this is still the original and the best!  Together with the Sky-copter and the Fork Lift Truck of it's day, you could put the there sets together and produced the full bodywork too.  This set epitomises what true Lego building was about - it uses studs, not too many specialised pieces and long before the studless beams that limit building possibilities and imagination.  This gave me more fun than any other Technic set I own - and I own a lot!  Lego, please re-release this set again!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:30:17Z","Lego's BMW 2000CS / Volvo 144E / etc.","It had been quite a while since I last took my 853 out for anything other than moving Technic set boxes from one closet to the other.  So one recent rainy Saturday morning, I brought it out for building.  

Opening the lid of the 853's box causes the clock to quickly roll back.  When this set made its debut, the then-new Technic pieces looked strange and exciting to brickbuilders (look at all the holes in the pieces -- is something wrong with them?  And what's up with all those funny gears and things?).  Seeing the 853's pieces now brings a cozy feeling of nostalgia.  

So I staked out a comfortable place on the carpeted floor, opened the instruction booklet, and began.  Despite the cat's tendency to want to &quot;help&quot;, work progressed smoothly.  The building of the 853 follows more of an assembly-line fashion (as compared to the 8860's unit-body feel), with the finished engine/transmission and seats fitting neatly into the nearly-complete chassis.  Soon the big red monster was built, once again proudly sitting out for all to admire.

25 years ago, the 853 sat at the pinnacle of Lego technology.  Back then it was amazing that Lego could make such a big set with so many intriguing features -- a big inline-4 cylinder engine mated to a two-speed transmission and driven by the rear wheels, working steering, adjustable seats, those huge tires, and even a backseat armrest!  If you didn't feel like building the car or the alternate model midget racer, then this set provided a plethora of parts for your imagination's delight.  I recall building a dragster once with working steering and engine (I-4 situated behind the driver's seat).  Impressive.

The 853 was sophisticated for its time, and its great-deal-of-fun reputation endures to this day.  The rarity of the set (particularly if no pieces are broken or missing, and comes with box and instructions) also contributes to the appreciation level.  Catch it if you can, it easily rates 10/10, 24 April 2004

"regosmat","2008-06-30T23:35:38.28Z","For its time it was great ... but","This was my first technic set, and wasn't I lucky that this one was it.  Such a beast in terms of size and versatility.  I used to love breaking this thing up and designing the other vehicle they gave you in the instructions.  

Though this car and my brother, I learnt how cars mechanically worked and what some of the terms were that represented the parts.  The gears were awesome but sometimes were hard to get into place.  My biggest beef with this one though was its structure.  I found that it easily broke apart and that the entire engine popped off it you pushed it to fast and the pistons simply could not keep up.  

Use to enjoy hooking up the old 4.5v monitor to this thing but it really looked kind of ugly when you did it the way the instructions recommended.

Regardless for its time it was great but many other chassis tye cars have since been released which I much preferred.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Time4TT","2008-12-22T01:50:14.997Z","The original","What a set! Lego's first attempt at using their newly created technic blocks / gears to make a large model. It was a large and sagged a little in the middle due to insufficient reinforcing, but a great first step on the road to making many great cars. No differential gear at the back meant the back wheels would slip around corners, and the engine would only turn over in both gears if on the carpet.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Also, it's worth noting that the engine revs more smoothly and quickly than later cars, making a satisfying noise that most of the other cars lack.</p><p>If you get a chance, get this set.

"fgee","2011-10-02T12:36:32.657Z","Still my most loved technic set","<p>This was my very first technic set and is still my favourite. I got it when I was ten years, right after it arrived in the store. It gave me endless hours of play, and challenged me for years to try and build own ideas. 30 years later I still own my original set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main design flaw was the lack of a differential, as mentioned by others. Thus I bought me a spare differential when the black 8860 technic car was launched two years later. This finally solved the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also own the 8860 technic car, which runs smoother, but the 853 is more fun due to brighter colors and endless variability. Eventually I took the cylinders from both cars and built a V8 engine, and fitted it to the 853 :-) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is really&nbsp;one of the all time best sets. It may happen on a rainy sunday afternoon that I take it from the shelve and build it up with my 10-years old son... If you can get a 853 set, do it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"redbeardlegoman","2013-02-09T14:51:35.843Z","The set that made me start to care about Technic.","<p>This set came out the same year I did. &nbsp;34 years later, I finally got it as a lucky garage sale find from my parents. &nbsp;They paid $10, and it came in the original box with tray liners and everything. &nbsp;Score!</p><p>I can't really add too much to the reviews that so many others have written. &nbsp;There is, however, one area that I don't think has been addressed: building the engine.</p><p>The engine is extremely challenging to build. &nbsp;There are two reasons for this. &nbsp;First, it is hard to tell exactly where gears should be placed on axles. &nbsp;You have to do a lot of fudging to make the entire system line up properly, and that leads into the second challenge of building the engine. &nbsp;It's a bit tricky to build without undoing work you've already done as you try to juggle the new parts into place.</p><p>However, I should point out that this set was made in the late 70s, and Lego instructions have (mostly) vastly improved since that time. &nbsp;As well, despite the occasional frustration, it's nice to have a real building challenge. &nbsp;It's hard to find a set that truly challenges a builder, without being a bank-busting mega-set anymore.</p><p>Finally, the nature of the chassis simply begs a builder to come up with a worthy body for it.</p><p>Other pros and cons have been better commented upon by other reviewers, so I'll simply include below those I feel are most pertinent:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A cool set that displays nicely on a shelf.</li><li>An honest-to-goodness building challenge.</li><li>It really purrs when you drive it along the floor or table top.</li><li>It practically begs one to build a body for it.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No differential.</li><li>Structurally weak, which causes sagging.</li><li>At times, building the engine to fit properly is frustrating, with little actual help from the instructions.</li><li>The engine often requires going over several times to make adjustments or to rebuild.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This is a beautiful set that makes a non-Technic fan happy to have prominently on display. &nbsp;A challenge to build in a sea of sets that are often not challenging at all. &nbsp;I would highly recommend this set to any serious AFOL.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Gamlebilrokker","2020-06-23T12:39:53.137Z","More difficult than the Sian!","<p>You want a set that&#39;s more difficult than the Lambo? Well, here you have it. Especially when you own the first version, with the instructions on form of a poster. It&#39;s so incredibly difficult to see, and understand what you are doing, a veteran builder like me has difficulties to make out what was used in each step, how often, and where. The poster style instructions was also drawn by hand, and therefore lacks the scale, so you can&#39;t just count studs if you don&#39;t know where to place this or that. You think I&#39;m wrong? The whole crankshaft, with pistons and con rods is ONE DRAWING, it simply appears as a step. No further explanation. One step it&#39;s not there, the other it is. Good luck.</p>

<p>At least my copy works fantastically well, and there is no sign of friction, bad gears, snapping U-joints or whatever else other reviewers are complaining about.</p>

"FlagsNZ","2014-07-16T05:56:40.49Z","I have waited 34 years to build this set","<p>I have always considered this set to be the pinnacle of the original release of Technical sets in the late 70&#39;s and have always wanted this set in my collection.</p>

<p>I built&nbsp;MOCs&nbsp;using my full range of Lego particularly from sets <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/855-1/Mobile-Crane"">855 Mobile Crane</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/857-1/Motorbike-with-Sidecar"">857 Motobike&nbsp;with Sidecar</a> emulated on this set.</p>

<p>I recently purchased this set from eBay after waiting 34 years. Did the build meet my expectations?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Technical&nbsp;sets (as they were first called) came in strong boxes reinforced with expanded polystyrene. The cover of the box has a slot to store the instructions.</p>

<p>The box itself, is lined with clear plastic dividers.</p>

<p>The instructions were not included in this purchase&nbsp;but nowadays they are easily downloaded as PDFs.</p>

<p>As these sets represented&nbsp;some new building techniques, the first few pages of the instruction included several vignettes&nbsp;showing how the new Technic system works.</p>

<p>I did get an advertising flier promoting the challenge for Lego experts of 9 and over.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3887/14479908010_a64580a4cb.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This new Lego theme introduced 8, 16, 24 and 40 tooth gears. It also introduced&nbsp;two types of <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3749"">pin connectors</a>, a <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3713"">bush</a> and an <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3651"">axel pin connector</a>. Despite this being the largest of the initial Technical sets, it only uses one type of pin connector&nbsp;and does not include the 16 tooth gears.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3740"">wheels</a> are based on the smaller Lego City wheels. The tyres&nbsp;remain as the largest solid foam tyres in the Lego system.</p>

<p>The set includes four 2x2 square <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3652"">pistons</a>. These make up a&nbsp;massive engine when compared with the newer <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4112203"">pistons</a> of today&#39;s Technic range.</p>

<p>The crankshaft is made up of five <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3648a"">24 tooth gears</a> and four <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3705"">4 Technic</a>&nbsp;axles. The piston has a stroke of 1.5 studs making a capacity of&nbsp;each <em>square</em>&nbsp;cylinder 15 1x1 plates or 3072 mm&sup3;. The engine has a total capacity of 12288 mm&sup3;.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5509/14664122734_9419f2921a.jpg"" /></p>

<p>What is missing from the initial&nbsp;Technical system was a&nbsp;linear&nbsp;axle&nbsp;connector and a differential. This set uses <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/9244"">universal joints</a> to link the drive shaft and rear&nbsp;axles together.</p>

<p>All these new parts were introduced in an era when Lego had very conservative rules on new colours&nbsp;and parts. That being said, all these parts except the square piston are still universal parts and still in the Lego system, although&nbsp;many of them have had updated moulds to improve their strength.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I built this model over two evenings.</p>

<p>There is lots of regular Lego used in this set and all initial Technical sets. The engine is fully brick built as is most of the steering system.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5157/14479778668_91884f5d8f.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The tyres&nbsp;rub against the chassis on full steering lock.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I was surprised to find that there is only two speed gears in the transmission. It has 3:1 and 1:3 gear ratios however it is possible to have a 2:2 ratio using two 16 tooth gears.</p>

<p>I motorised this set using my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/870-1/Technical-Motor-4-5-V"">870 Technical Motor</a>. This revealed that of the two gears, one is forward and the other is reverse. It depends on the polarity&nbsp;of the battery to determine which way is which.</p>

<p>As there is no differential,&nbsp;the rear wheels slip when turning.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14479779868_db87e76f65.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The seats are adjustable however the mechanism that adjusts the front seats is prone to fall off.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/14479758929_18e99709ed.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When viewing this set&nbsp;against what existed in Lego when it was released, it is an advanced transforming&nbsp;build experience.</p>

<p>When viewed against today&#39;s critical reviewers;&nbsp;few would regard this build as meeting current expectations. There are weak design components and issues with the steering lock.</p>

<p>How did it meet my expectations?</p>

<p>I thought that from what I can remember, my MOCs had all the features that this set offers . My MOCs had three speed gear boxes, dipping headlights and better steering (admittedly using the smaller wheels found in set 855).</p>

<p>I still regard this set as an essential inclusion for any avid Technic collector and I am pleased to have it in my collection.</p>

"IHR67","2019-12-14T06:20:37.043Z","The grand-daddy of them all...","<p>I bought this set when I was 12 (in 1979): I remember mowing many lawns in my hometown (in rural Scotland) to earn the money to buy it but it was well worth it...</p>

<p>This was my second Lego technical set: my first was the helicopter 852 but this was by far and away the better set. At the time it was a complicated build, pushing the limits of the Lego system. The engine took <em>ages</em> to complete... The end result was well worth it.</p>

<p>Where the set was superb was the ease of alternate builds: as well as the go-kart b-model, I built a scratch-built 3 speed gearbox with reverse&nbsp; (using the 16 tooth gears from set 857); made a V6 engine block (using 2 pistons from set 871) and a front wheel drive car. (Hint: you need to locate a universal joint where the pivot point lines up with the pivot of the steering mechanism). And of course being British I just had to build a right hand drive version.</p>

<p>I had more fun with this set than any other Lego set. It was the right mixture of complicated and challenging enough to build but not so complicated that a kid couldn&#39;t amend it and push its limits further.</p>

<p>Is it better than Technic sets out today? That&#39;s not a fair question, as the Technic system has changed a lot since this was issued. Trying to compare this to the latest flagship sets is like trying to compare an original Landrover to a modern SUV, same intent but different execution.</p>

<p>But for me, this set will always have special memories. It kicked off a childhood interest in engineering which led to a 30 year engineering career.</p>

<p>If you have one in your attic you haven&#39;t looked at for many years, bring it out and build it. I guarantee you won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>
