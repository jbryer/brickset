Although he is very unique, since his torso upside down (compared to the other toa).  I like how he can kick.  He doesn't have a real weapon, although he has these cool things on his feet that make him have more force in his kick.  His mask is very good.  Overall, great, but not the best toa.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

When I got Huki ( or as I should say now Hewkii) I looked at the little poster that came with him I saw Pohatu. Wow. But I didn't get him until 2003. Building him was fun and well, diffrent than building other Toa. I like the kicking motion and FYI sterioboy1, he does come with the rock which makes for good target practice for his kicking and 2. Those stick thingys are FINGERS! Yes they are a pathetic attempt at finger but they are fingers and are quite rare to get on a figure nowadays. So over all breat set with cool mask except the mack leans wayyy out from his face so it looks like it is hanging from his mouth. But hey, small price to pay.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Joely","2007-08-27T14:23:40.893Z","Pohatu: Toa Mata of Stone","One of the origanal six Toa. Pohatu is a great set for a collector and a simple, cool set for a kid. As i'm writing this 2007 compared to the latest Bionicles this one seems primitive, but was new and great at the time.

The Canister:
The canister that Pohatu comes in is one of the most classic canisters and is quite cool as it features a twist system on the side so you can see each of the other Toa Mata and sort of a story of Pohatu's building. The lid features a toa head on the top 6 notches round the side of it. It is very easy to open (unlike others) and doesn't hurt your fingers. The picture of Pohatu shows him on a kicking a lego rock which comes with the set and also the you can pose the Pohatu like it is in the picture.

Building It:
Building Pohatu is generally quite easy and is very simple. It is built quite differently to the other Toa as it has an upside down body. The instructions are very clear and easy to use. The only real bad bit is the ball joints which can sometimes hurt your fingers if you do them wrong. Although the mask can come off easily.

The Complete Set:
Once you have completed Pohatu you see it was worth buying as it does look quite cool. The feet are the main weapons in the set as it has extra bits to put on the foot to make bigger and it has no weapons, but the hand things. Unlike the other Toa Mata the simple gear system is used to control the legs not the arms and it also come with an extra lego ball to kick. Like many of the earlier models it lacks much posebility in the limbs. 

All in all I'd give it an 8/10

"Blade","2008-02-24T22:26:35.217Z","Toa Pohatu!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. The original Bionicle shape totally blew the old Slizer form away looking stronger, more flexible and more human. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

The quick version goes: On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. One day an evil being called Makuta came and cast an evil shadow over the land. He took over with an evil rule and times were dark. A legend spoke of six heroes who would come and restore peace. One day six canisters arrived containing the six heroes. The Toa had almost no memory of their lives before arriving on Mata Nui. To defeat Makuta the will have to find the Great Masks of Power.

Obviously there is allot more to the story but this is the quick version of the first chapter and it would take forever to cover it all. This is about the six first Toa in particular Pohatu, Toa of Stone. His colour scheme is dark and light brown with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Kakama, the Great Mask of Speed. His weapons are the armouring on his feet.

Pohatu is different from his other five brethren of this series as he is the only one with an upside down torso and his gear mechanism is for his leg, instead of his arm. This gives him an excellent kick in combat and the ability to fire his boulder at enemies with great speed. He has no other weapons, just his hands, which as a child made him slightly lamer than the others but now in my age I can see the benefits in combat.

The Bionicle came in canisters similar to the Robo Riders, but these were fancier with a place on the lid to mount your Toa's masks and a label that slides around the canister revealing different things. Pohatu's canister is obviously brown. I cannot find any faults with this Bionicle and after all these years, allot of rough play, the joints and gear system are still strong. The only real issue in play I had was the head and or Mask came off a bit easily during a fight.

Overall this Bionicle was a great one to get, he added so much to my play and to finish the play could have been a weeks worth of free time as a kid. Like all Bionicle he isn't any fun by himself but once added with one other figure it goes right up and keeps getting better until you have them all. His aesthetics are quite good for the day he was made and I feel he is about an 8/10 or Excellent, as he has it all going for him and is well above average, but needed that bit more to get to 10. If you a Bionicle fan you need to start from the beginning and this is the beginning. A good one for people who are robot fans too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Another thing people complain about is that he has no weapon but he does. his feet and claws. He can block enimys weapons with his claws and can then kick them ove the herisen.

"Kalhiki","2010-04-17T10:23:26.543Z","Could it be? A Perfect Score?","<p>Going back to good ol' days with Pohatu Mata, the brown and tan Toa of Stone. The building experience, being a technic set, is unique, so that's good. Also, the parts, because it's a technic set, are also unique and very detailed. Plus there are pieces such as the mask, body, head, and foot attachments.</p>
<p>Playability is... so-so. I rated it 5/5, but it's more 4-4.5/5. Because of the way some of the ball joints are connected and lack of knees or elbows limits poseability. He hardly has any forward movement on his legs and arms, and hardly any backward movement on just his legs. Also, no neck articulation. But the gear function adds a little something. Turn the gear on his back and he kicks. And with the added bonus of the Kolhii Ball, he has something to kick. </p>
<p>The value for the money, I rated 5/5. But honestly, I can't remember what he cost. I think it was somwhere around 7-8 dollars. With the pieces and total awsomeness that is Pohatu, I'd say that's a good deal. </p>
<p>Overall, I highly recommend him. This is where Bionicle started. If you don't have him yet, I'd say to find and get him.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

His has no weapons which stinks. However he does have the rock raiders boulder which makes Pohatu unique. Actually Pohatu is very unique compared to the other Toa mata. His body is built very diffrently. and instead of having a karate chop gear function like the other toa, he has a kick action! Which explains the boulder. The canister is really cool to!

But space became a problem for both storage and display so I chose to keep only one of each series I'd picked up. Plus the six Bionicle Stars, which are much smaller and take up less room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pohatu is the Toa of Earth if I'm not mistaken and out of the first six he was the only one who used the torso piece in reverse from what was typical of the other models. This allowed for him to have a kicking gimmick with the geared pieces, so included with him was a LEGO boulder. He could kick this at the enemies of the Toa or kick the enemies themselves. Pohatu came with no other weapons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His build uses all the same parts we've come to expect form early Bionicle and it was rather simple and straightforward. All six original Toa could combine into two larger models using instructions found in the back of each book. I never indulged in this gimmic because I felt that indivudally the models stood up much better than the hodge-podge gestalts you could build with the Toa. This is my preference, yours may differ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say the first batch of Toa were quite impressive looking for the limited number of pieces they had available to them at the time. They didn't have proper hands or feet like more modern Bionicle sets, but that isn't a bad thing because it allowed for imagination fueled play. I'd recommend these sets to any fans of Bionicle who have yet to pick them up, Pohatu is also strongly recommended because I really loved his gimmick and the LEGO boulder he came with.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Nmfrey23","2021-12-25T05:01:32.98Z","Toa of stone","<p>Pohatu is my personal favourite of the original 6 Toa from 2001. Each of the Toa are unique, but Pohatu has a pretty noticeable difference: his torso is upside-down. This may look a bit odd at first, but it allows for a function that none of the other 01&#39; Toa possess. This, coupled with his unique weaponry choice and cool mask help to cement him as a favourite of mine.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>.Contains one of 12&nbsp;new mask pieces</p>

<p>.New foot pieces for weapons</p>

<p>.Gear function allows him to kick instead of swing a weapon with his arms</p>

<p>.Has the most parts out of the Toa Mata (49).</p>

<p>.Can use the boulder as a projectile when kicked</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>.One leg is floppy at the hip, creating balance issues (this can be fixed)</p>

<p>.Looks a bit odd due to his upside down torso, and flat widened shoulders</p>

<p>.Arm movement is pretty bad since the shoulders attach from the back instead of the side</p>
