"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-25T14:57:23Z","Oh yeah!","The oldie! The classic! Onua! He is awesome. His mask is superiorly designed. It has the look of a nice, sleek mask and the compatability of a flat boring mask. His arms, like Gali's, are very adjustable, being able to be moved twice at once. His claws are very nice, only there being a flaw that they can easily bend. Lego made a very good decision in this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-24T00:43:46.387Z","An Instant Classic","There is one reason I bought this set, and that is because I had money to due it after returning a duplicated Christmas gift. Okay, so I probably would have still gotten it anyway, but that's not the point. The point is that this set is downright one of the best Bionicle sets to date.

Now to an actual review, which will be based on memories six years old, so bear with me here :P. The canistar is eye catching. It has a very attractive black/dark grey metallic top with holes and a Toa head in it. It also has some stunning can art, with even more information. It has a can code, which was given along with the mask code to unlock information about Onua. There was also can art for the other five Toa. One of the things that makes this can original is that all the artwork is on a separate sleeve that is put around the canistar. It is not a sticker like all the other ones were. This sleeve is meant to turn, and a little window shows you all the masks of the Toa as you turn it. Why that is, I have no clue. It just is. 

After you open the canistar (which you might have trouble with. Took me like ten minutes due to the confusion with the sleeve, lol) a whole assortment of pieces will fall out along with an instruction booklet. The booklet is easy enough to follow, although due to the fact that this Toa is black, it's sort of hard to make out vital details. But it's not too bad. 

There are three key things to this set that make it what it is: The mask, which isn't just a mask like it would be today, but a stunning piece of plastic that gives an incredible compliment to the set. Next up are the claws, which are also very cool, and really gave the guy and earth-Toa feel to him. The last part is the gear system. Those beautiful gear systems now long gone. . .(snif) But anyway, the gear system was great, giving the Toa the ability to look like it was attacking. Combine the gear system with the easy-off mask and you get a pretty entertaining battle mechanism. Now with all the non gear and plus-rod masks, that's virtually impossible. Ahh. . .nostalgia. 

All in all, this is a great classic set, and really stands out with his mask and Toa stature. It's a real shame (and I mean this) that Toa are popping up everywhere, and masks are no longer incredible objects of power that must be obtained to defeat the enemy, but are instead just another tool with no purpose other than to have an extra power. This set is still together after six years, and I still have more fun with him than any of the recent sets combined.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

THE GOOD
-For only $7 or so dollars (U.S.), you get about 30 pieces, and a cool can.
-Simple and easy instructions (aren't they all?)
-Lego actually had a neat concept with the first few Bionicles: The Toa of Earth has cool claws to dig with, and looks... well... cool!

THE BAD
Legs are not that possible

The UGLY
None (whew)

A great addition to any Bionicle collection.

I am also very sick of all the new stuff being released and I think that the story is bad. However, the original Bionicles did have good design.

"Blade","2008-02-24T23:10:02.09Z","Toa Onua!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. The original Bionicle shape totally blew the old Slizer form away looking stronger, more flexible and more human. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

The quick version goes: On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. One day an evil being called Makuta came and cast an evil shadow over the land. He took over with an evil rule and times were dark. A legend spoke of six heroes who would come and restore peace. One day six canisters arrived containing the six heroes. The Toa had almost no memory of their lives before arriving on Mata Nui. To defeat Makuta the will have to find the Great Masks of Power.

Obviously there is allot more to the story but this is the quick version of the first chapter and it would take forever to cover it all. This is about the six first Toa in particular Onua, Toa of Earth. His colour scheme is black and grey. His mask is the Kanohi Pakari, the Great Mask of Strength. His weapons are his claws.

Onua was my first Bionicle and is one of two from the first series that have not one but both of his arms move. The other is Gali (8533). This gives him the ability to tunnel underground with the greatest of ease, when under attack he is ferocious and lightening fast, when on he offensive. He is the shortest of the six, mainly due to his head position and helps with his tunnelling ability. He has a very awesome mask, similar to a hockey mask and always reminds me of Jason from Friday the 13th. 

The Bionicle came in canisters similar to the Robo Riders, but these were fancier with a place on the lid to mount your Toa's masks and a label that slides around the canister revealing different things. Onua's canister is obviously black. It also has a can code, which allowed you to unlock information about Onua from LEGO’s website. Unfortunately the page no longer exists. Also as another person already said the artwork on the canister is quite amazing. The instruction’s quite clear and easy to read and they also have details to build a super Toa from Onua, Pohatu and Tahu (8531 + 8534) over the three instruction books.

I cannot find any faults with this Bionicle and after all these years, allot of rough play, the joints and gear system are still strong. The only real issue in play I had was the head and or Mask came off a bit easily during a fight.

Overall this Bionicle was an excellent one to get, he got me into the series and added so much to my play, to finish the play could have been a weeks worth of free time as a kid. Like all Bionicle he isn't any fun by himself but once added with one other figure it goes right up and keeps getting better until you have them all. His aesthetics are great for the day he was made and I feel he is about a 9/10 or Almost Perfect, as he has it all going for him but needed that bit more to get to 10. If you a Bionicle fan you need to start from the beginning and this is the beginning. A good one for people who are robot fans too.

The early Bionicles were some of the coolest ever made, I just wish I got more. :( My favourite parts of this set are Onua's claws and mask. They are very quaint and simple compared to modern Lego.

"Kalhiki","2010-08-12T20:06:38.333Z","The Hunchback of Onu-Wahi","I like him. He has a lot of personality and is just great. I really don't know where else to go.<br>BUILDING EXPERIENCE<br>There wasn't anything new or different. I mean, his head connects a different way than the other Mata, and he does have the gear function, but other than that there isn't much.<br>PARTS<br>Parts are good. This section is mainly for MoCists, but in this set you get a Mata body, Pakari, Claws and some other old/rare parts. So if you bought him for the pieces, I think you'll be happy. Plus, black can be incorporated into almost any model.<br>PLAYABILITY/POSEABILITY<br>Poseability... Well, no neck, elbows, wrists or knees, so he has less than your average Mata. He also can't move outward at the shoulders nor can he move forward or back at the hips unless you remove the leg at the axle. Playability is good. Turn the gear on his back and you get his ""digging action"". His arms move up and down (One up one down). For this gimmick, the lack of elbows is actually good as it makes the arms sturdier. His mask is also loosely fitting. I mean, it stays on well, but it can be knocked off. This is for the whole deal with if you have a Rahi you can have them battle and try to knock the other's mask off. It's a nice play feature, but just be careful not to loose the mask never to be found again.<br>OVERALL AND VALUE<br>I think he's worth your money. He's fun to play with, and is a good display piece. Since you can't get this guy in stores anymore, You'll have to find him online. I recommend paying up to around eight dollars for him, but since he isn't being sold anymore, maybe a little more would be okay. <br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

On the canister it shows Onua in a cool pose and he is underground tunneling with his huge claws.

<p>Like all the Toa Mata, an easy but fun building experience.&nbsp; He is exactly like Gali's build, but the piece that connects his head to his body is different, and put lower.&nbsp; The way you put his head on makes him a hunchback, but looks cool and is different from the other Toa.&nbsp; The parts are good, not the greatest for&nbsp;MOCing, though, because there is only 30 pieces (the least&nbsp;out of the Toa Mata).&nbsp; Onua also has great playability.&nbsp; His function is more realistic than&nbsp;Tahu's, because his fuction is&nbsp;making the claws go up and down.&nbsp; His&nbsp;""Clawing"" function would be good against enemies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onua used two geared pieces so that both arms could move in tandem and strike at the evil followers of Makuta. His model was built using the same standard pieces found in early Bionicle sets, the only unique piece was his mask. His coloring was a nice blend of blacks and greys and I especially liked the fact that you could attach his hands any way you saw fit. He could claw downwards, claw upwards or just have his hands out sideways to grab someone in a tight grip and hurl them away.</p>

<p>Overall I'd have to recommend all six original Toa to any Bionicle collectors. Their parts are also quite nice for any kind of building you'd prefer if you aren't a super fan of the original model's design. Improvisation is the key with Bionicle Toa or what have you.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Zatth","2012-01-06T19:32:20.12Z","Onua Mata: First of the Bunch!","Ever since I became a big fan of bonicle in 2004, my favorite Elemental power was earth. It still is. I just fell for the Earth bionicles, with their hunched looks and dark green eyes. As Onua was the first Earth Toa, I always viewed him (in Mata form) as my dream vintage set. <br><br>Thus, I was ecstatic when my brother got him for me for Christmas this year. <br>So nostalgic.....<br><br>Onua has a fun, unique build. Typical of Earth Toa, he is hunched and shorter, with his head being on a lower level. He is also exclusively black and dark grey, except for the wonderfully contrasting dark green eyes. The building experience was fun, it's very exciting to see those pieces come together, especially the gears. The build is also quite quick.<br><br>As for playability, Onua is superb. (At least if he's taking on opponents his size.) The main attraction for his playability is his gear feature. As many before me have said, these gear features were not gimmicky, instead they were quite fun and as the original Toa were smaller they added a great deal more playability in that respect. Onua's gear action causes his clawed arms to swing up and down alternately, which is very satisfying to do. He can rip through just about any enemy you put in front of him. (Or at least it feels like he could.) He is also terrific for scaling cliff walls.<br><br>Just one con in this great set: His size. Continuous with the nature of bionicles during 2001, Onua is smaller than many later sets. Naturally, this does mean that compared to other Toa he has low levels of articulation and is hard to truly pose. <br><br>Do not be deterred by this. If you love the Element Earth, if you love old bionicles, if you want a piece of lego history - get this set. You won't be disappointed, and you'll probably be pleased! Cheers!<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
