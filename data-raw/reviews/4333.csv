She was my first, and she is the coolest since her hooks are good for ripping the opponent's mask off, and climbing stuff.  She can really hang from stuff!  The character of gali is also great since she commands the water.  Her mask is really cool since it is transparent blue (see-through).  Also, she isn't too expensive!  Only about 10 bucks! (canadian).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T11:01:59Z","Gali rocks!","Gali Olda. I loved her. Yea, she's a girl. And of course, girls have to rule, since there are precious few in the saga. And then there's the Kaukau, the only trans-color mask in the whole thing, with the exception of the clear Avohkii, which wasn't even in the storyline (not that it wasn't cool though!) The hooks are too cool. And if you don't like the color of the hooks, you can get a different set with hooks and attach those (there's 8 or 9 colors you know.) Overall, I can only say wow. Just wow.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T01:37:44Z","The original is the best.","This is the best version of Gali. The newer Bionicle sets have strayed too far from their Technic roots, but this version of Gali combines the modularity of Lego Technic with practical action figure design. And thankfully, there is NO silver to be seen here. Yay!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-24T23:45:45.2Z","Toa Gali!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. The original Bionicle shape totally blew the old Slizer form away looking stronger, more flexible and more human. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

The quick version goes: On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. One day an evil being called Makuta came and cast an evil shadow over the land. He took over with an evil rule and times were dark. A legend spoke of six heroes who would come and restore peace. One day six canisters arrived containing the six heroes. The Toa had almost no memory of their lives before arriving on Mata Nui. To defeat Makuta the will have to find the Great Masks of Power.

Obviously there is allot more to the story but this is the quick version of the first chapter and it would take forever to cover it all. This is about the six first Toa in particular Gali, Toa of Water. Her colour scheme is light and medium blue with a touch of black. Her mask is the Kanohi Kaukau, the Great Mask of Water breathing. Her weapons are her hooks.

Gali is the only female Bionicle and is one of two from the first series that have not one but both of her arms move. The other is Onua (8532). I have to say I love the way everyone can't work out the hooks, they are for climbing the waterfall of Lake Naho (Read up people). I find the hooks great as they have a fair bit of versatility to the for climbing and grabbing, not to mention quite dangerous in self defence. Her mask is the only one of the six that is see-through as a posed to solid colour. This makes it more relevant to the name for breathing underwater and at great hight.

The Bionicle came in canisters similar to the Robo Riders, but these were fancier with a place on the lid to mount your Toa's masks and a label that slides around the canister revealing different things. Gali's canister is obviously blue. It also has a can code, which allowed you to unlock information about Gali from LEGO’s website. Unfortunately the page no longer exists. Also as another person already said the artwork on the canister is quite amazing. The instructions are quite clear and easy to read and they also have details to build a super Toa from Gali, Lewa and Kopaka (8535 + 8536) over the three instruction books.

I cannot find any faults with this Bionicle and after all these years, allot of rough play, the joints and gear system are still strong. The only real issue in play I had was the head and or Mask came off a bit easily during a fight. There is one thing I would change thou. The way the shoulders are attached, they look too broad, turn them in, make her look a bit more like a girl.

Overall this Bionicle was a great one to get, she added to my play and to finish the play could have taken a week worth of free time as a kid. Like all Bionicle she isn't any fun by herself but once added with one other figure it goes right up and keeps getting better until you have them all. Her aesthetics are excellent for the day she was made and I feel she is about an 8/10 or Excellent, as she needed that bit more to get to 10. If you a Bionicle fan you need to start from the beginning and this is the beginning. A good one for people who are robot fans too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-07T20:14:46.263Z","Water?!","What lego needs: weapons! These Toas can not survive if they have no weapons! Gali: cling onto rocks is her talent/weapon?! I have seen the recent bionicle and they have weapons, how come they have never thought of it sooner!? I've seen the movie, and they have weapons, how come these toas don't?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-03-05T07:43:27.92Z","What a great start!","I just got Gali yesterday from Bricklink (she even included the mini poster and instructions), and I must say I'm impressed with BIONICLE's beginning.  First of all, I ordered Gali because she's been on my want list for almost six years now, and I'm glad I finally have her, and she has exceeded my expectations.  Her hooks and feet are darker blue than I thought from the picture; they're about the same color blue as the torso, if you have Gali Nuva (2003).  There are also a few MOCing pieces, like the hooks and maybe the head, although I won't dare try to take pieces from Gali.  She is surprisingly posable, even though she has minimal ball joints.  Playability is almost off the chart.

Pros:

-Playable

-Posable

-Hooks!

-Gear system!

-Good ole Kanohi Kaukau (I have three in my collection now)

-One of the original BIONICLEs

Cons:

-Compared to newer sets, Gali doesn't have enough ball joints for posing and playing purposes, but seeing as this is a collector's item, and it's eight years old, who cares???

Overall, 5/5.  Great set, worth the $$$, and definitely a must-have!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To star, Gali has an oober cool mask.&nbsp; Where her eyes are it is see-through blue, so that looks really nice.&nbsp; Her function is swinging her claw-like weapons up and down with the turning of a gear in the back.&nbsp; She has the original limbs and feet like all the Toa Mata, but in dark and light blue.&nbsp; Like all the early Toa, the heads can't move, so that limits a little bit of playabilty.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, a good Toa.&nbsp; I do enjoy her, but shes not the best Toa Mata.&nbsp; I still recommend you try to get her off ebay for under $10.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T16:19:01.813Z","Female Toa Gali","<p>Set #8533 Gali: Intended to represent a female character it is fitting LEGO chose to give her the cool blue coloring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gali was the second Toa to feature double geared arms for dual attack action. Her weapons of choice were the twin sickle-like blades, which the picture shows her using to climb towards something. Perhaps searching for the powers of the other Masks of her five brothers. She was the Toa of Water. Did I neglect to mention that? As I mentioned already her coloring was a&nbsp;nice mix of blues and her mask stood out as being the only transparent mask from the original batch of six. Though it wasn't completely transparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend the original six Toa to all Bionicle fans especially MOCers who enjoy using the Bionicle Technic pieces for special and interesting builds. These figures were fun to play with despite their slightly hindering gimmicks where poseability was concerned. (The geared parts made posing their arms or legs tricky depending on the Toa.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
