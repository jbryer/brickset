"Joely","2007-06-26T15:19:48.653Z","Tahu: Toa Mata of Fire ","One of the origanal six bionicles Tahu is a great set for a collector and a simple, cool set for children. As i'm writing this 2007 compared to the latest Bionicles this one seems primitive, but was new and great at the time.

The Canister:
The canister that Tahu comes in is one of the most classic canisters and is quite cool as it features a twist system on the side so you can see each of the other Toa Mata and sort of a story of Tahu's building. The lid features a toa head on the top 6 notches round the side of it. It is very easy to open (unlike others) and doesn't hurt your fingers. Unfortunatly the picture of Tahu has him on a lavaboard which you don't get (which is odd as you get a rock with 8531 Pohatu).

Building It:
Building Tahu is generally quite easy and is very simple. The instructions are very clear and easy to use. The only real bad bit is the ball joints which can sometimes hurt your fingers if you do them wrong.

The Complete Set:
Once you have completed Tahu you see it was worth buying as it does look quite cool and looks good for the leader of the Toa Mata. It has a very cool red fire sword on one arm and a type of hand on the other. It doesn't have much difference to the other Toa Mata, but like 8536 Kopaka and 8535 Lewa he does have a ball on his chest for some reason. Like many of the earlier models it lacks much posebility in the limbs. 

All in all I'd give it an 7/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2008-02-25T03:49:34.857Z","Toa Tahu!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. The original Bionicle shape totally blew the old Slizer form away looking stronger, more flexible and more human. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

The quick version goes: On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. One day an evil being called Makuta came and cast an evil shadow over the land. He took over with an evil rule and times were dark. A legend spoke of six heroes who would come and restore peace. One day six canisters arrived containing the six heroes. The Toa had almost no memory of their lives before arriving on Mata Nui. To defeat Makuta the will have to find the Great Masks of Power.

Obviously there is allot more to the story but this is the quick version of the first chapter and it would take forever to cover it all. This is about the six first Toa in particular Tahu, Toa of Fire. His colour scheme is red and orange with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Hau, The Mask of Shielding. His weapon is a firesword.

Tahu is known as the leader of the Toa's for some reason. I cannot find anywhere showing or naming him as the leader. I have watched the movie and they work as a team with no real leader other than the 7th Toa. So my conclusion is that he isn't the leader. I think people assume he is as he stands tall, has a sword and is red. He doesn't even have the first number, Pohatu dose and they were all released at the same time here. He dose have a very sweet looking mask which comes across kind of intimidating. The flame sword is a very cool looking weapon and has the ability to cut through rock. P.N. Joely and others: it's not a lava board it's a piece of rock and it’s a scene from the movie.

The Bionicle came in canisters similar to the Robo Riders, but these were fancier with a place on the lid to mount your Toa's masks and a label that slides around the canister revealing different things. Tahu's canister is obviously red. It also has a can code, which allowed you to unlock information about Gali from LEGO’s website. Unfortunately the page no longer exists. The artwork on the canister is quite amazing. The instructions are quite clear and easy to read and they also have details to build a super Toa from Tahu, Pohatu and Onua (8531 + 8532) over the three instruction books.

I cannot find any faults with this Bionicle and after all these years, allot of rough play, the joints and gear system are still strong. The only real issue in play I had was the head and or Mask came off a bit easily during battle.

Overall this Bionicle was a excellent one to get, he added to my play and to finish the play could have taken a week worth of free time as a kid. Like all Bionicle he isn't any fun by himself but once added with one other figure it goes right up and keeps getting better until you have them all. His aesthetics are excellent for the day he was made and I feel he is about an 8/10 or Excellent, as she needed that bit more to get to 10. If you a Bionicle fan you need to start from the beginning and this is the beginning. A good one for people who are robot fans too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"dragon_teenager","2011-08-17T22:17:27.617Z","Definitely a classic in my eyes. ","I might be a little biased in reviewing this set, because I have so many fond memories of Bionicle in 2001. In a very rare occurrence, I became fascinated by the story surrounding Bionicle. The mysterious, dramatic and sometimes dark mythology was an incredibly unexpected move for LEGO - before then, we had been getting Roboriders and Throwbots (AKA ""Slizers""), both of which barely had any backstory at all.&nbsp; <br><br>Aesthetically, the Toa ""Mata"" (back then they were simply called Toa) were leaps and bounds ahead of anything LEGO had attempted before. This is particularly evident in the masks - without exception, the 6 collectable ""Great Masks"" from 2001 were beautiful representations of the elements. Tahu's is one of my favorites, since it is very fierce and warlike in appearance. <br><br>Once constructed, Toa Tahu is a very tall and thin figure. At the time, more than half of the parts included with Tahu were completely new to LEGO Technic. The humanoid appearance of the model was also rather unusual, and Tahu stood quite a bit taller than any of the Throwbots. The Toa of Fire's appearance is very menacing, and I'd again describe him as warlike. With a fire sword (a completely new idea at the time) and a bright red color scheme, Tahu looked like the leader he was known to be in the mythology. <br><br>I gave this set 5 stars for playability, but that really has nothing to do with the functionality (you can turn a gear in the back of the figure to move one of his arms up and down). The playability largely comes from the story, which involved going on a quest to locate and claim the 6 Great Masks, guarded by minions and traps placed by the enigmatic Makuta... who, at the time, was nothing more than a spiritual presence. This rating is definitely biased, I admit - but it definitely highlights the ""Bionicle effect"", meaning that you're either really into it or you really aren't. In order to fully enjoy this set, it's worth it to read up on the 2001 mythology and fully understand the unusually deep and creative story that LEGO had created. If you're not really into Bionicle, though, I can't say I'd really recommend this set for anything more than a parts pack. Bionicle, for me, was an awesome theme that drew me in as a young adult because of the fascinating (and sometimes theological in scope) world that surrounded these action figures. Playing MNOLG probably had something to do with that, though. <br><br>If you were among the first to purchase one of the Toa ""Mata"", you got a free CD-rom full of cool CGI animations and interactive puzzles that tied the whole mystery of Bionicle together. For a fan like myself, that was an awesome bonus, especially for a mere $7. <br><br>I wish that LEGO had maintained the atmosphere of Bionicle throughout more recent years, and now the theme is officially discontinued. Regardless, I still remember 2001 very fondly, and I think other owners of the Toa ""Mata"" will understand where I'm coming from.<br><br>Definitely a great set, and in my mind, a true classic. <br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>Tahu as far as models go features an interesting look, instead of having two identical arm pieces he has one normal arm piece and then a second different piece so he can wield the flames of his abilities.

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-10-04T20:51:39.487Z","Tahu, the original poster boy and a fun set even today","<p>Tahu was the last of the original six Toa my younger brothers and I acquired back in 2001; he was a birthday present for the middle brother, who had earlier been given Kopaka (yes, the three of us wound up with the element-opposite pairs). We were all very excited, and I in particular pushed Quinn to get Tahu built fast so that we could watch his clip mini-CD with him in hand. And of course the idea of finally being able to build Akamai was quite exciting.. I remember those days fondly. While my brothers&#39; interest waned over time, mine did not and Tahu was given over to my keeping, along with the rest of their toa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being a classic Toa, Tahu did not come in a box but rather inside a canister intended to be kept as a separate-storage container (very useful, since many key parts are best stored separated). The lid (which in-universe represents a shrine) had six 1-deep axle sockets spaced evenly around it; these for placing Toa heads in order to store the collectible Kanohi masks on the lid. The top of the lid had a sculpted replica of a Toa head on it, for holding a Golden Kanohi (In-universe, these each had the powers of all the regular masks, and out-of-universe they look cool). On the underside of the lid was an axlehole for storing a Toa Tool. I use the past tense because sadly my mother discarded all of our Toa canisters and lids (and Tahu&#39;s original Fire Sword along with them, meaning I had to buy a replacement)</p>

<p>The instructions are crystal-clear and easy to follow, with no mistakes. The booklet also contains roughly a third of the instructions to build one of the two official Toa Kaita: Akamai, a gestalt fusion of Pohatu, Onua, and Tahu. Tahu&#39;s section is the final section.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Tahu comes with the original Bionicle torso and feet in red, a red Technic block with ball socket, an original Toa head in light gray, pinkish-red eyes for it, three orange original Bionicle legs, one original Bionicle weapon arm in orange, four black Technic horseshoe joints, two small gears and one large gear, assorted Technic axles, one #2 Technic axle-joiner w/hole, one black perpendicular axle-joiner, a Technic ball with an axle socket, a red Kanohi Hau (the mask of Shielding, and Tahu&#39;s default mask), and Tahu&#39;s fire sword. The parts are fairly nice, and the limbs and torso have some nice sculpted joints and pistons.</p>

<p>Also included with each original Toa, was a promotional mini-CD. The CD contained information about Bionicle&#39;s basic story premise, and fairly good-looking clips of the Toa in action that could be unlocked with the code on each Toa&#39;s default mask. Tahu&#39;s clip shows him donning his mask and then bashing a piece of rock loose to surf some lava on.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Tahu:</p>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward. It starts with forming the gear assembly in the top of the torso, then moves to building the limbs on, and finishes with adding the weapon and popping the mask on.</p>

<p>Akamai (final third):</p>

<p>Pohatu and Tahu&#39;s heads are attached to the left hand&#39;s rods to create a hefty hammer. Then assembly of the legs begins, with Onua&#39;s arms and Tahu and Pohatu&#39;s legs forming most of them while Onua&#39;s legs are used to stabilize the thighs. Be a bit careful not to stress the shafts of the ball joints on Onua&#39;s legs. When the legs are completed, place Tahu&#39;s Kanohi Hau -or the golden Hau if you have it- on the head and Akamai is complete.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Tahu:</p>

<p>Tahu stands tall, and broad-shouldered. His left arm is bulky and ends in a big red clawed hand. His right arm holds his mighty Fire Sword, and can be made to swing it by the Technic gear mechanism in order to topple an opponent or knock their mask off. His red and orange color scheme is a perfect fit for the cosmic element of Fire.</p>

<p>Akamai:</p>

<p>Akamai is a giant. He has decent bulk, and height-wise he comes up to about the base of Brutaka&#39;s neck. His legs sturdy (as well as broad in the hip), are articulated at the knee, and operated by gears (whose movement is restrained slightly by a ball on the end of the drive axle being plugged into a mounted horseshoe joint) in such a way that he can almost walk. He has hefty shoulder pads on his arms, which are individually-geared thanks to his construction. His left arm boasts a hammer, and in his right he wields Tahu&#39;s fire sword. His mask, while resembling a Kanohia Hau (canonically golden, but the instructions just show Tahu&#39;s red one since the gold and silver masks came from mask packs), is in fact meant to be Kanohi Aki, the Mask of Valor. All in all, very impressive.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While original Toa like Tahu lack the articulation of later Toa designs, that was never their main goal. They were designed as Technic building sets with Technic gimmicks, and that also happened to be action figures when assembled but had plenty of alternate building potential. The Voya Nui-onward sets largely abandoned these roots and the Technic gimmickry, becoming instead buildable action figures held together in some places by Technic parts, and the alt-building potential diminished outside of Titan sets.</p>

<p>Tahu is fun to build, fun to play with, and looks good. There&#39;s fun to be had collecting his extra masks, even if they&#39;re a bit pricier (albeit less random) than mask packs were at retail. And the combined build of Akamai plus the general expanded building potential is well worth getting at the very least Pohatu and Onua as well.</p>
