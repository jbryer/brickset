Okay, yes the set has a lot of new pieces but at least it still has the holes for technic axles. I don't really like the ball and socket joins. If you move it around too much, they become really loose. Another thing that bothers me is that the mask is just too big for the body and it doesn't even stay in properly connected to the head. It has only one tiny place to hold the mask and it is very weak. At least it has one movement, you turn the gear wheel at the back and the hand with the axe moves up and down. It is pretty poseable, you can make it into a couple of position. What makes the original Bionicle good, is that even if most pieces are new, they still have the holes for technic axles, the new sets hardly have that. I wouldn't actually recommend this to people because there are better sets for small kids to start them into the Technic line. I guess you could buy it, only if it is at a really deep discount.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I don't care what every one else says but the toa nuva were pitiful compared with these excellant creations. First of all the mask is not the cool thing it used to be. Now its just a stupid plus rod thing that can not be knocked off...Lewa's mask kinda sweeps back to fit his powers of air. His tool is probably only put into this set. It is really cool. Now the gears have been taken away. I like bionicle but nothing can compare to Lewa which I remember saving up fo weeks to get {I was 5 or 6} No body really likes bionicle anymore and when i was younger i gave into peer presure and took him apart Now i bought a new lewa to set on my shelf and he will do so for a very long time

"Blade","2008-02-26T21:35:51.607Z","Toa Lewa!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. The original Bionicle shape totally blew the old Slizer form away looking stronger, more flexible and more human. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

The quick version goes: On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. One day an evil being called Makuta came and cast an evil shadow over the land. He took over with an evil rule and times were dark. A legend spoke of six heroes who would come and restore peace. One day six canisters arrived containing the six heroes. The Toa had almost no memory of their lives before arriving on Mata Nui. To defeat Makuta the will have to find the Great Masks of Power.

Obviously there is allot more to the story but this is the quick version of the first chapter and it would take forever to cover it all. This is about the six first Toa in particular Lewa, Toa of Air. His colour scheme is light and dark green with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Miru, the Great Mask of Levitation. His weapon is a long axe.

Lewa has to be my favourite Toa from the first release. His Axe is just a thing of beauty and this is the only set it has been released in to date. I also like the way it can be used again with other Technic LEGO. I somehow managed to acquire two of these axes and it really makes Lewa awesome in play. His mask is one of the nicest from the first series being symmetrical, well shaped and curves round his face. His arm I always thought was a gun as a kid but I can’t find any reference to this so I’m assuming it was my imagination hard at it again. As long fingers they give him an extra advantage and look cooler than the others. Finally his mask being the power of levitation is my all time favourite power of the six, as air is essential to all and I love flying.

The Bionicle came in canisters similar to the Robo Riders, but these were fancier with a place on the lid to mount your Toa's masks and a label that slides around the canister revealing different things. Lewa's canister is obviously green. It also has a can code, which allowed you to unlock information about Lewa from LEGO’s website. Unfortunately the page no longer exists. The artwork on the canister is quite amazing. The instructions are quite clear and easy to read and they also have details to build a super Toa from Lewa, Gali and Kopaka (8533 + 8536) over the three instruction books.

I cannot find any faults with this Bionicle and after all these years, allot of rough play, the joints and gear system are still strong. The only real issue in play I had was the head and or Mask came off a bit easily during battle.

Overall this Bionicle is an excellent one to get, he added to my play and to finish the play could have taken a week worth of free time as a kid. Like all Bionicle he isn't any fun by himself but once added with one other figure it goes right up and keeps getting better until you have them all. His aesthetics are excellent for the day he was made and I feel he is about a 9/10 or Almost Perfect, as he needed that bit more to get to 10.

My brother on the other hand was 7, so he got Taha, Kopaka, Gali, Onua and Pohatu! That left only Lewa, which was perfect for me because back then I was even more fanatical about green than I am now. So when my 6th birthday came around, I was so excited to get Lewa, my first ever Bionicle! I didn't get disappointed.

Lewa is an awesome Toa and is truly worthy if the title. The colour scheme is great, using emerald and lime greens to make the Toa Mata of Air truly awesome. 

Pros:
- Kanohi Miru
- Colour Scheme
- 'Hand' is cool
- Swivelling arm function
- Axe is supreme
- Build

Cons:
- Canister picture shows him posed in a way that you can't pose him

Their first mission was to go to Karda Nui, where energy spikes were affecting the Rahi there. Then they battled Avohkah, Rahi made out of lightning. Then they went inside the Codrex and crawled inside Toa Canisters. They were launched into the sky. They were supposed to be heading for Metru Nui, but the canisters malfunctioned and drifted for years in the ocean. That was, until, a Matoran called Takua found Toa Stones on Mata Nui which summoned the Toa Mata to Mata Nui. But unfortunately, drifting in the ocean for thousands of years made them lose their memories. They met the Matoran and Turaga living there, who told them about Makuta and the Great Spirit. They each found 5 Masks of Power, which would aid them in their fight. They battled infected Rahi who were controlled by Teridax. (AKA Makuta.) Then they battled Teridax himself. Teridax was weakened by the battle, so he triggered the signal which awoke the Bohrok Swarms. The Toa Mata battled the Bohrok and collected their Krana. Then they faced Cahdok and Gahdok (The Bahrag), the commanders of the Bohrok. The Toa Mata trapped the Bahrag in a Toa Seal. But then they fell down pipes and landed in Protodermis... which transformed them into the Toa Nuva!

<p>Lewa's big selling point is the large green Technic axe piece that he comes with. I really loved that piece. Like Tahu his right arm was geared while his left was not, so he could swing that big honking axe at his adversaries. Nowadays LEGO would probably employ a few more pieces in order to build the axe and perhaps make it larger, but that's no reason not to overlook this charming set. If you're interested in getting the older Bionicle sets you should definitely pick them up, since they don't use as many unique pieces as later sets in the line you can mix-and-match them up to make all kinds of crazy combinations.

"xboxtravis7992","2015-11-04T06:13:47.26Z","The Set that started it all...","<p>As 2015 comes to a close, I can&#39;t help but stare at my complete collection of the new Bionicle Toa Master figures, and wonder how in the world did that happen. How could a 21 year old go out and spend his money on constraction figures? Why would an AFOL&nbsp;buy entire collections of Bionicle when his money could be better spent on system sets? Well, Bionicle has a huge nostalgic appeal for a young AFOL such as me, and nothing explains it better than this, my first Bionicle set Lewa&nbsp;Toa of Air. This review will try and explain my perspective as a kid back in 2001 when Lewa first started hitting store shelves, and my views on this now. Warning, this is a long review...</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>Well those Bionicle canisters were definitely one of Lego&#39;s greatest packaging designs. As a kid they caught my eye, the plastic film was fun to rotate around the canister, allowing me to see through the transparent windows different scenes depicting Lewa and the 5 other Toa. I loved that the top of the canisters would form a &quot;Suva&quot; to store masks from Bionicle&nbsp;lore. As a kid, I would throw down rugs and blankets to form an island of Mata Nui on my bedroom floor, and I would use the canisters to form villages for the Toa and villager figures.</p>

<p>As an adult: well that moveable film is kinda annoying now, I am worried that the packaging is going to slide of the old can any moment. Other than that though, these cans are still great. I throw away a lot of Lego boxes, but all my Bionicle cans are intact. They make great storage for the set, when I don&#39;t want to display Lewa I just pull of a few limbs and shove him into the canister. I know exactly where Lewa is, and I can relive un-boxing him every time I open the set. As an adult I now appreciate the complex&nbsp;story symbolism that these canisters represent; pills bringing &quot;warriors&quot; to fight the evils which have damaged the health of Mata Nui, that wasn&#39;t a story detail I understood when I was a kid but one which shows the attention to detail Lego put into Bionicle!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As a kid the part which drew my attention was that big green mask. I was already used to the normal Lego bricks, so holding a piece with so few studs was a big draw as a kid. I loved how smooth and solid it felt in my hands. That big axe was awesome too.</p>

<p>As an adult, I still see the mask and the axe as awesome pieces. The other pieces are okay too, their shape lending to the classic Bionicle look. But the real problem is the pieces are so overspecialized that they really don&#39;t lend themselves to any&nbsp;other type of build. The legs without moveable knees, that big chunky torso brick,and the mismatched arms. They were things that didn&#39;t bother me as a kid, but do bother me now. Still, that mask and axe are so awesome they really save this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As a kid the build was quick, but just a way to get to see Lewa&nbsp;finished. I didn&#39;t care that it was simple or complex, I was just glad that I could do it! Naturally the ease of the build meant that I often disassembled and reassembled Lewa&nbsp;for use in MOC&#39;s and other projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an adult, yeah this build is really simple. Nothing really to go home about, what you see on the box shows nearly every building step to assemble Lewa. The fact that Lewa is nearly an exact clone of the Kopaka and Tahu sets, with only minor differences with the Gali, Onua and Pohatu figures is really disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As a kid I loved this model, it made me ask for the rest of the Toa, and by Christmas of 2001 I had a complete set of Toa and Turaga. This set really hooked me into Bionicle, and I lasted until the start of 2007 as a big fan. I liked playing with these guys as action figures, when I played by myself or friends we retold the stories of the island of Mata Nui and the Toa&#39;s fight against evil.&nbsp;On the most outlandish of playtimes,&nbsp;Lewa&nbsp;and the Toa Mata were able to become&nbsp;husbands to different Barbie figures&nbsp;when I had to play toys with my sister... Now that is one versatile action figure!</p>

<p>Now as an adult I recognize this sets flaws, the floppy arms, the static head, the legs without knee motion, and the other issues. But, I still love this guy, his mask is perfect, he just looks cool! Nostalgia like this was what led me to buy Tahu Master of Fire in 2015, and before I knew it history had repeated itself and I was the owner of the full team of 2015 Toa. I think that is a testament to the good qualities of these original Bionicle&nbsp;2001 sets, when I saw the new sets I instantly recognized &quot;hey, here are the same guys from 2001!&quot; The image of Lewa from 2001 is still engraved in my head even when I look at the very different Lewa from 2015. These 2001 sets had many many flaws, but they established a look that managed to carry over through a long franchise, and has reappeared&nbsp;now in the reboot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>So would I recommend these sets? That is a hard call, seeing that they have been &nbsp;off the market for 14 years now, often fetching Ebay prices that are often higher than the original sell price. So, if you find a used Lewa cheep, buy him. He is a great piece of Lego nostalgia. If you still own one of these guys stuffed in the back corners of your Lego bins, keep him: again a great piece of nostalgia and something that someday can be passed on to your children. If seeing Lewa again makes you have a desire to go and buy&nbsp;some Bionicle&nbsp;figures for the first time in years, do it: you&#39;ll be surprised at how the 2015 figs&nbsp;maintain the spark which made these 2001 figures so great.</p>

<p>It is hard to explain my feelings for Lewa, I know he is a flawed set. I know he is very juniorized, simplified, and basic. Yet when Lego first introduced us to the Toa Mata back in 2001 they created a toy icon. Lewa isn&#39;t a great set because he has a great build, or great features, he is great because he is iconic.&nbsp;Lewa&#39;s descendants are not limited to the new Bionicle, but can be seen in all in-house Lego themes now, from the characters of Ninjago, Chima, and every Lego theme to tell a story. Lewa and the other 5 Toa Mata was when Lego went from a company that sold&nbsp;toys, too a toy company which tells stories (is it any surprise the 6 Toa Mata get a brief cameo in The Lego Movie then?). Lewa&nbsp;and the other Toa Mata are icons of Lego history.</p>

"Capricorn","2012-12-17T20:11:10.93Z","Toa Mata Lewa, the Unposeable!","<p>This set is Toa Mata Lewa of 2001, and you probably only have him if you are a dedicated Bionicle collector, or he just showed up one day. Either way, this set is great for its age, and I'm sure when he and his five companions washed up on store shelves they were quite something new. Anyways, this set has 36 parts, an awesome air axe, a green Kanohi Miru mask, and a few useful technic parts. If you can find one of these in new condition, you are lucky my friend. Well, on to the review.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts of this set are still very technic-like, since this guy was created before Bionicle really broke away from Technic. It contains several useful pins and axles and rods and stuff, that you can really use anywhere, and you'll also notice their colors are different than today because this is an example of before juniorization came into play. The face behind the mask, with the brain stalk, cannot be seperated easily but they do the job for his head. The mask itself really symbolizes Lewa himself. The probably best addition of this set is his 'wicked' chopper axe, thats a darkish green and looks really good with the figure. Unfortunately though, the body is only 1 peice, and his feet are prone to cracking, especially after nearly 12 years of sitting on my shelf. Meh, I suppose the parts just get brittle as they age. Lewa also comes with this wierd hand thing on his left arm, like a few other Toa Mata.<br></p><h4>The Build</h4><p>The build is not too challenging and rather quick. The gear system in the upper-torso, along with the head, is probably the longest part. You'll notice the legs and arms are all three parts, so they are not very fun to build. Building the head is very fun... there is a satisfying click when you insert the brain into the face. The gear system is not actuall quite easy to build either. If you push the gears too tightly on the rod, it will get jammed and produce a terrible clacking sound when you try to turn the gears. Putting the mask on last is probably the second-best part of the build. The left hand is also tedious to construct.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The build and parts may not be too excellent, but the playability does exceed that of other Toa Mata. If you turn the gear on his back, his right arm will swing up and down with his air axe. If you got a Lehvak its much fun to smash those guys right on the krana where it hurts. Also, with the early Rahi titans you could knock off his mask, and even then put a krana or kraata over his face and steal his mind. This in fact did happen in the story line if I recall correctly. The upper-body is great, but below his torso... not so much. Like the other Toa Mata, Nuva, and even Takanuva, his legs only bend foward like ten degrees but out to the side like theres no tommorrow. The hand is also quite funky and original, and the left arm can sometimes swing if the set is old, when you move him. Overall, its quite a good set.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Even though he is barely poseable, the gear system, his collectables and collectability, and his axe and mask all undo that. He is worth having just for the sake of having him, since its such an old set. The parts can be useful in some situations, and the head and mask really do the trick for him, along with the axe. This set is a good one to have, but don't get your heart bent on getting him at all costs because he isn't neccessarily worth more than a few bucks. Despite this, it is still a great set and a neccessary addition to any Bionicle collectors left out there in the world.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3

<p>- This set is decently posable&nbsp;and features a swinging arm mechanic, posable hand and a headpiece that supports interchangeable masks.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>- This set features many pieces exclusive to it which distinguish it from other Lego sets and variations (Lewa Nuva, Phantoka Lewa&nbsp;Nuva, Lewa&nbsp;Master of Jungle).</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>- This set retailed at $7 (USD) which is a fair price keeping in mind the unique pieces, functions, and the time spent on building.&nbsp;The piece count is a little smaller than I would like to have seen for the retail price, however, constraction sets tend to have big statures but fewer pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion (2.5&nbsp;/&nbsp;5)</strong></p>

<p>- Lewa&nbsp;is a solid set with debatably&nbsp;the most unique&nbsp;weapon among his Toa Mata counterparts. His pricing is fair although his piece count doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect that. Among newer&nbsp;sets,&nbsp;Lewa&nbsp;stands much smaller than most others however the price difference for his smaller stature makes Lewa a solid set.</p>
