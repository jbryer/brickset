"Gus_263","2008-02-13T13:51:09.7Z","First Kopaka","With a single sword and a little shield, kopaka looks like a warrior, with a don't symetrical mask, you can see his eyes as well. The colors, a light gray and white are awesome, and he also contains black pieces that can see in some bionicle. Feet and some pieces are the same of various bionicle, but it is great to make creations, having same bodies, compatible arms, legs, and head you can build a kaita as seen in the instructions. Like roboriders, they have combinations.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-26T23:43:47.247Z","Toa Kopaka!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. The original Bionicle shape totally blew the old Slizer form away looking stronger, more flexible and more human. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

The quick version goes: On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. One day an evil being called Makuta came and cast an evil shadow over the land. He took over with an evil rule and times were dark. A legend spoke of six heroes who would come and restore peace. One day six canisters arrived containing the six heroes. The Toa had almost no memory of their lives before arriving on Mata Nui. To defeat Makuta the will have to find the Great Masks of Power.

Obviously there is allot more to the story but this is the quick version of the first chapter and it would take forever to cover it all. This is about the six first Toa in particular Kopaka, Toa of Ice. His colour scheme is white and grey with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Akaku, the Great Mask of X-Ray Vision. His weapon is his Ice Sword and he also has a shield.

Kopaka is the sixth and final Toa from the first release. He is the only Toa to have two different weapons. Armed with his ice sword in one hand and shield in the other you can tell this guy is a warrior and a survivalist. The Shield also doubles as a small, round snowboard for Kopaka to use. As a child I didn’t think Kopaka had the best mask, but I could see that it is only the optical eyepiece that gives him the x-ray vision, that appears slightly out of place. I do think LEGO made it slightly too big in this release. I must say his neon blue eyes look awesome and really suit his colour scheme.

The Bionicle came in canisters similar to the Robo Riders, but these were fancier with a place on the lid to mount your Toa's masks and a label that slides around the canister revealing different things. Kopaka's canister is obviously white. It also has a can code, which allowed you to unlock information about Kopaka from LEGO’s website. Unfortunately the page no longer exists. The artwork on the canister is quite amazing. The instructions are quite clear and easy to read and they also have details to build a super Toa from Kopaka, Gali and Lewa (8533 + 8535) over the three instruction books.

I cannot find any faults with this Bionicle and after all these years, allot of rough play, the joints and gear system are still strong. The only real issue in play I had was the head and or Mask came off a bit easily during battle.

Overall this Bionicle is a great one to get, he added to my play and to finish the play could have taken a week worth of free time as a kid. Like all Bionicle he isn't any fun by himself but once added with one other figure it goes right up and keeps getting better until you have them all. His aesthetics are excellent for the day he was made and I feel he is about an 8/10 or Excellent, as he needed that bit more to get to 10. If you a Bionicle fan you need to start from the beginning and this is the beginning. A good one for people who are robot fans too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-05-18T13:51:51.733Z","Toa Mata of Ice","Kopaka was my... 2nd bionicle, although I didn't like bionicles back then, so I broke it up. Fortunately, I've built him back.

Pros:
Kanohi Akaku, Mask of X-ray Vision
Ice Sheid
Ice Sword
Stands up well
Very Poseable

Cons:
Mask falls off easily

Overall, 5/5, and if you are a bionicle collector like me you will enjoy it as much as I do.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

He is the best of the bunch, with his ice sword and sheild, and great mask of x-ray vision.  However, the greatest thing about Kopaka, and all the early Bionicle sets, is the gears.  His sword arm moves by turning the gear on the back, and his sheild arm is held in place.

The colour scheme is great, the white and grey, a very subtle, but appropriate design for the coolest toa of ice ever!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"buzzandwoody2000","2011-08-20T20:36:20.04Z","Amazing with the others","<p>Alright. My fith Toa Mata review will be alot better than the others, as I can write more now and am a exellent writer from already writing the first novel in my book sereis. Kopaka is a very cool Toa Mata, with the same gear function as the other Toa Mata's. His sword is one of my favorite weapons, as it is unique to this set. The sheild on his left arm is pretty nice, the only problem being THERE IS HOLES IN HIS SHEILD. If you had holes in your sheild in a real battle, you'd be dust in about 20 seconds. His mask is deatiled and fun, as it is used in play like bicnoucualrs most of the time. His head is the normal Mata/Nuva/Turaga/Matoran and other 2001-2003 Bionicle sets only with blue eyes, common for Toa of Ice.</p><p>He is a very nice set and I recommend you buy him and the other Toa Mata on Bricklink, Ebay or Amazon.</p><p>buzzandwoody2000</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T16:40:19.517Z","Toa of Snow and Ice","<p>Set #8536 Kopaka: Kopaka is the only Toa with a shield and his weapon is a curious looking sword, I think the weapons he wields as Kopaka-Nuva were a bit better thought out compared to this one, but this one still has it's charms. Kopaka almost looks like a shining white knight of legend in Bionicle form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kopaka only had the one arm geared to swing his sword, but that was more than enough to have hours of fun playing with this model. I think his connector points should have been white instead of black personally, but I can see why LEGO did it this way so that his shoulder pieces wouldn't blend into the white of his body. His mask was one of the better looking ones, but you can't beat the Toa-Nuva re-imaginings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I once again state that all Bionicle fans who have yet to acquire the vintage Toa sets should do so. These sets are simple to build, fun to play with, great for displaying and great for modification and MOCing, or just plain mixing up all the parts to come up with wild and whacky ideas. (I suggest merging Tahu and Kopaka together so that one side is fire and the other is ice, then switch between the two masks as necessary for whichever personality is in charge at any given time.) ;)</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Palmpou","2014-05-14T18:36:23.303Z","Action figure","<p>This set is one of my favorite sets. It is a very nice set. It comes with a main body piece that doubles as a gearbox and limb (because the butt has a 24t spine that can be used in gearing), a few bevel gears and an awesome mask. Included is the best bionicle sword in the series. Although white coloration is somewhat bland, it still looks really nice. The instructions give a snippet for how to build the lewa-gali-kopaka&nbsp;combination set as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the personal bias in the world doesnt mask some dissapointments with this. Its basic construction makes it a brick. The left shield arm is mounted in a way that it cannot rotate, and doesn&#39;t allow the limb to move forward anyway. This makes kopaka&nbsp;stiffly grab his shield and look awkward. You can shift it a bit or reattach it for the free axis but then he looks really lopsided (and the hand ends up a tad too short). For this reason its hard to play with, and if you want to do anything aside from put it on a shelf and are above modifying the original model, I reccomend you get a different toa mata instead, like pohatu for example.</p>
