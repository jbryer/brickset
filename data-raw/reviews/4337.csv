The mouths are weapons of onua and gali. They also have claws, same of onua with good painting. The different colors are lime green and orange. The black is in the two. They are awesome rahi, very playable and good to build. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I just fought them with each other. They're cool because you hold them like a gun and pull the trigger and then the wings join together fast and make the coolest noize ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-21T05:16:26.21Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Rahi) - Nui-Rama Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. The nui-rama creatures have the same play feature: The claws can be moved and if you push the back you can make the wings sviwel. There's also a tail which you can use as a handle if you want to maneuver them. I like the lime green and orange colors on those creatures and the design looks great as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
