"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-27T14:24:18Z","One of the best Bionicle sets","This set takes awhile to build but it has an excellent action feature and alot of play value. Muaka looks great sitting on a shelf with those infected Hau masks, and both Muaka and Kane-Ra a perfect enemy for your Toa. Both sets feel nice and sturdy after construction. Sadly, LEGO  pretty much stopped making sets like these after the Bahrag. All in all, a highly recommended set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T13:34:26.047Z","Awesome rahi","Another set that includes two figures. These like to each other, but one like a bull and other a tiger. The colors are awesome, one with yellow, another with red. The mouth is great, the arms too, with long claws. They don't have legs, but systems on back. Are big sets, and in overall, one of the best rahi.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Their huge maws and neck-extending action fascinated me from the start. Finally, after almost a decade, I can hold the models in my hands and get a better taste of them.</p><p>The set offers two nearly identical Rahi models, Muaka the tiger, and Kane-Ra the bull. Both are built with the same design, and differ only in their color schemes and their respective animal features (the Muaka has ears and claws, for example, while Kane-Ra sports horns and hooves).</p><p>Their entire frame is constructed as an extending grabbing device. Ba squeezing their torso, their head thrusts forward, and they open their jaws at the same time. When their neck is fully extended, an ingenious bit of engineering makes their mouths shut. Their bite is pretty powerful.</p><p>The reason for this gimmick lies within the action game that the sets of the era featured as a common theme. With the various Rahi that were sold in pairs, the players had to hit or punch each other's Infected Masks off. This set goes even further -- if you bite onto the long beams extending from the animals' shoulders (on which the masks are pinned up) and then pull them out, the legs of the victim fall off. It looks awfully painful, not to mention the game requires you to snap the model's jaws wildly, and all the parts that fall off could easily end up being lost, which is why I display the sets instead of playing with them.</p><p>The way their head is built is absolutely gorgeous. They look bulky and mean, and have that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Technic</span> feel to them that later Bionicle sets abandoned. I found a lot of surprises along the way when constructing the set, and at times I wasn't sure which part would end up where. But after a while, it all came together, and really made me appreciate all the thought that went into designing the models.</p><p>That is not to say, though, at I have nothing to complain about. While their upper bodies are very well built and look nice, they don't have anything I would call an actual lower body. Their torso is constructed of a couple of thin beams, and instead of back legs, these animals have small caterpillar tracks. They look so wimpy and weak compared to their front that it's amazing. Also, these tracks are on a swing-joint and while this allows you to make the figures stand up, they also tend to flip backwards whenever you try to roll them along a flat surface. Another negative aspect is that this is their only articulation point. Other than this, their whole body is stiff (excluding the neck and head, but those are held in place by rubber bands anyway). Not even their legs can move or bend, they are locked into position for the action feature. I am quite dissatisfied with how little attention they payed to these parts, however I also understand that adding too many pieces would have made the set's price rocket up.</p><p>Another thing you have to take into account is that you have to build two models, which are barely different. I had a helping hand thankfully, but if you are building them on your own, you might get tired after finishing one of them.</p><p>The Infected Masks deserve a mention before I finish the review. While the ones on Kane-Ra aren't anything special (they are just black Kanohi Huna masks, although they were exclusive to the set), the Muaka has two gorgeous looking Infected Kanohi Hau masks, with painted rust effects. They could be only found in this set, which makes them even more special.</p><p>As for a ""pros and cons"" list, lets brake it down:</p><ul><li style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros:</li><li>great looking set<br></li><li>you get two models</li><li>a very creative and fun function</li><li>satisfyingly complicated and involved built</li><li>rare Infected Masks</li><li>high play value, but only if you dare to smack them against each other</li><li>all the small differences lend the two models individuality</li><li>many useful, if old-school, pieces</li><li>the boy they come in isn't as absurdly huge as current boxes tend to be<br></li><li style=""font-weight: bold;""><p>Cons:</p></li><li>no articulation to speak of</li><li>the greatness of the design vanishes halfway through the models</li><li>the long poles the masks sit on look weird on the beasts<br></li><li>building the things might be boring and repetitive</li><li>the set is not easy to find nowadays</li><li>since one of its main gimmicks is to fall apart, the set tends to, yes, fall apart</li><li>rubber bands may decay after a while<br></li></ul><p>Overall I have to say the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Muaka &amp; Kane-Ra</span> set is worth picking up, although you may need to be lucky to find one at a decent price these days. Still, they can be easily obtained on-line if you can afford them. While not the best Bionicle set of all time, at least in my opinion, it is a legendary set that must have captivated the fantasies of the kids back then when it first came out. It sure captivated mine. I would rate it 4 for the poor lower bodies and the lack of articulation, but considering their purpose, namely to be played with, and the complexity of their design, I give it 5 stars. I only rate the building experience lower, since building the two models may be repetitive.</p><p>But all things considered, it is a must have for fans of Bionicle's beginnings (those who were or are able to get them, at least), and I even recommend it to ""regular"" <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Technic</span> builders. A blast from the past, and surely one of my favorite Bionicle sets ever.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
