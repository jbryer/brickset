The set also contains a lot of pieces that have been discontinued at least since the mid eighties: the white panorama window, some roadsigns and a variety of clear bricks.

Thanks to the bus-stop sign and the accompanying -absolutely unique- shelter, this set is a natural counterpart of the 379 busstation.
In turn, the half-timbered house and the remains of the city wall (with a lovely protruding kiosk) make this set practically a sibling of the 1592 town square.
finally, the post office/warehouse with its hoist-beam is, in itself, clearly a predecessor of the 1620 chocolatefactory.
All these aforementioned sets put together, are linked by yet another feature: The multibrick black lampposts.

The main street is by far the hardest set to get from this list, and obtaining the other three sets, isn't a walk in the park either. But if youre lucky enough to collect all of them, they will provide you with a splendid historic city centre.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It comes with 2 cars that cannot hold a mini figure unfortunately, but that doesn&#39;t affect the playability at all. You can get this set for around $100 to $200 complete which isn&#39;t bad for how old it is and the amount of pieces you get. The box art is beautiful and the back of the box builds are just as good as the main set.</p>

<p>I am very glad to have this set complete with the box and original mailing box.</p>
