"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T13:02:05Z","Little blue guy","This was the third Technic set I owned.  Like the 8845 and 850, the 854 contains lots of amusement in a relatively small set.  I reworked the steering mechanism and the driver’s seat of the 854 to turn it into a two-seat roadster, which helps change the scale to where it doesn’t look too funny when being towed by the 8846.  

Like the 850, the 854 has uncomplicated construction, is easy to modify, has plenty of wheels, plus it’s blue... 9/10 without the usual fluff.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-25T05:23:33Z","Compact, simple but fun","My first technic set. At the time my concept of friction was not so well established, so i overtightened all axle/pin/gear combos resulting in a go-kart that didn't.

One rebuild later with looser conections and it was a delight to play with, with the cylinder flying up and down whilst making a very cool whirrring sound at high speed thanks to the nice gear ratio involved.

The only real weak point was that the front really needed wheels as wide as the back. Easily rectified though with some spare wheels 'stolen' from my brothers long abandoned 6950.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2008-11-17T17:01:07.14Z","from a simpler time","First things first, I never really fancied this set when I was younger. Then I happened to see one on ebay and I thought, why not. I'm sure glad I did. This set is brilliant, there's none of that modern 'one piece, one job' mentality. This is, after all one of the very first technic sets, and it stands up to the test of time very well. It's made from proper bits of lego, it's the sort of set anyone can build from any pile of bricks, you only need the instructions and your going to end up with a decent result. That to me is what lego is all about. The model itself is very well put together, better in fact than 8842, which was really the face lift model of 854, but lacked a lot of the character. No real flaws that I can think of. Very good overall, get one if you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-06-04T08:09:29.56Z","still nice and provides tons of fun!","I liked this set always and it took me about 30 years to get it. The design is very cool, it comes heavy but not plumb. The colour scheme with mainly blue and little stains of red and yellow is great, also the number sticker on the bricks gives a realistic look. This one is a classic, and i always wonder why hardly any sets from very early 80s or late 70s havent found their way to lego legends, they would had deserved it so badly.

But so awesome once I finished.&nbsp; <br><br>I can still hear the ticking of the cylinder now, and feel the carpet burn on my knees from racing it around the house.<br><br>Note on Value for money: I've no idea, it was a present as a kid.&nbsp; But I did use it A LOT!<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

Still do..</p><p>An attractive and simple little model, this go-kart knows no peer when it comes to oversteering on the kitchen floor :) It even makes the engine noise for you. Ahh, brings it all back..</p><p>With my critical hat on, I could ask why the seat is oddly sized and the front tyres so narrow; but with a thing as much fun as this that doesn't matter.

"Count_Tofu","2016-02-23T18:10:25.583Z","My introduction to Technic","<p>This must have been my introduction to Lego Technic and I loved it.</p>

<p>The 80&#39;s Technic boxes were quite nice; a flap that could open and some of the parts highlighted in a special inlay under the plastic cover. Many of these boxes where made of styrofoam which made them very re-usable for storage of bricks.</p>

<p>The one cylinder engine and the steering compartment just blew me away. Now I could build Lego cars that could actually steer!</p>

<p>I played a lot with this set. Never actually build the alternative model since I don&#39;t care for motorbikes very much. I also used this as a basis for building many other cars with steering, for which I used bricks from other sets.</p>

<p>Overall a great starter set back then.&nbsp;</p>

"FlagsNZ","2014-07-24T06:34:28.49Z","A realistic little Go-Cart with heaps of versatility","<p>I saw this set advertised for sale recently along with set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/870-1/Technical-Motor-4-5-V"">870 Technical Motor</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/872-1/Two-Gear-Blocks"">872 Two Gear Blocks</a>. I bought all three sets. I was particularly interested in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/872-1/Two-Gear-Blocks"">chain links</a>&nbsp;in the gear supplemental pack.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>All of the three sets&nbsp;purchased&nbsp;came in immaculate condition with boxes, liners, advertising flyers and instructions. The go-cart number 9 sticker came in original unused condition!</p>

<p>The boxes were made far superior in those days and included expanded polystyrene strengthening and clear plastic parts dividers.</p>

<p>The instructions&nbsp;have plans for five separate models.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is part of the original series of Technical sets introduced over 30 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has one <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3652"">square piston</a>&nbsp;and a fully brick built motor. It introduced the <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/9244"">universal joints</a> on a rack and pinion steering mechanism. The steering system is fully brick built and&nbsp;uses 2x2 <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3680"">mini turntables</a> for pivots</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As far as the initial Technical Sets go, it is a straight forward build. It is sturdier than its larger cousin <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/853-1/Car-Chassis"">853 Car Chassis</a> with a better designed single seat. The steering lock is better and the steering wheel is rigidly held in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5545/14686305993_8db33282a0.jpg"" /></p>

<p>It avoids the need for a differential as only one rear wheel is connected to the drive shaft.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/73071"">Differentials</a> did not appear in Technic sets until 1980 with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8860-1/Car-Chassis"">8860 Car Chassis</a>.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for the original&nbsp;Technical engines with their square cylinders. They show how engines work better than the current versions. This one cylinder would probably be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-cooled_engine"">air cooled</a> on a real go-cart and therefore would need the cylinder head cooling fins. These fins are probably not needed on the 853 engine.</p>

<p>These engines found on the first few series of Technic sets with their square pistons have a great sound when driving along.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a really neat little Technical Set with lots of playability. With five models available from the instructions, it is quite versatile.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you get your hands on one of these sets, it is a worthwhile purchase.</p>
