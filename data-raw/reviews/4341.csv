"Gus_263","2008-02-22T12:26:29.543Z","Old Vakama","The old vakama, a turaga of Mata Nui. This version have a cool mask, and have toa mata heads as feet in the red color. The staff is good, but it isn't in the movie (the movie is juniorized and it bores). The turaga set have another awesome colors, like the orange arms and legs. The hands and body are black.

"Blade","2008-03-12T07:32:50.09Z","Turaga Vakama!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. These guys are the Turaga elders. The Turaga are former Toa who have sacrificed their Toa power for the greater good of the Matoran. They continue their lives as Turaga to help and guide the Matoran.

This is Turaga Vakama, protector of Tahu's legend. His colour scheme is red and orange with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Huna, Noble Mask of Concealment. The weapon he carries is the Ancient Firestaff.

Vakama is the second tallest Turaga and consists of 26 pieces. His Firestaff is only used by one other set, 8554 (Tahnok Va) in LEGO making this piece quite uncommon. His mask is quite different to the Toa masks and this one reminds me of something of of the predator movies.

I am aware the use of faces for feet has ranging comments over the Turaga. I personally dont mind them. Yes the Toa feet look better, but they are thick and stable so I cant complain.

Overall their aesthetics aren't as good as the Bionicle and their playability is weaker but this what you have to expect from a support model. They were very cheep in their day, made an excellent gift or stocking filler and helped expand Bionicle collections considerably. For this I feel this guy is a 6/10 or Above Average. Again this is mainly due to the awesome fun I had with them as a group. A must for any Bionical fan and a great way to expand your Bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:06:38.64Z","Nice beard","Turaga Vakama is a little guy with a cool staff and a cool beard. My brother really likes him, but I don't find him so appealing.

Pros:
Staff
Nice beard
Red Toa heads as feet

Cons:
Orange, not red

The fact that he is orange not red has made me really angry with LEGO, so Vakama gets a 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:27:05.077Z","Great mini bionicle","Good for any fan, this is one of the six turaga (later followed by Dume...) which each had similar designs. The feet were cool since they were heads, and the tool was new at the time, plus it had a rubberband arm system similar to the Toa's gear system.
Though this specific turaga, though important and classic, is, in my opinion, not the best of the six. The weapon isn't very fearsome, and I was never fond of that specific mask...
The color scheme was great, but perhaps a flame sword would do him justice.

All in all a great set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T11:24:39.31Z","pocket money paradise","These sets are nice and cheap but the reason most people get them is because of the cool Mask and the even cooler weapon which is fine. If you get enough of them then you can get a bad guy and a toa and with enough imagination but I don't think that many people buy multiples of this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
