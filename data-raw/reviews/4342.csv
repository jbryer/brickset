In overall this set is great, have usable pieces and features. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-03-12T08:37:51.67Z","Turaga Matau!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. These guys are the Turaga elders. The Turaga are former Toa who have sacrificed their Toa power for the greater good of the Matoran. They continue their lives as Turaga to help and guide the Matoran.

This is Turaga Matau, protector of Lewa's legend. His colour scheme is light and dark green with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Mahiki. The weapon he carries is the Kau Kau Staff.

Vakama is the second smallest Turaga and consists of 25 pieces. His Kau Kau Staff is only used by one other set,  8469 (Slammer Raptor) in LEGO making this piece quite uncommon. His mask is quite different to the Toa masks and this one reminds me of that guy for the man in the iron mask.

I am aware the use of faces for feet has ranging comments over the Turaga. I personally don't mind them. Yes the Toa feet look better, but they are thick and stable so I cant complain.

Overall their aesthetics aren't as good as the Bionicle and their playability is weaker but this what you have to expect from a support model. They were very cheep in their day, made an excellent gift or stocking filler and helped expand Bionicle collections considerably. For this I feel this guy is a 6/10 or Above Average. Again this is mainly due to the awesome fun I had with them as a group. A must for any Bionical fan and a great way to expand your Bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:10:20Z","Chop chop!","Turaga Matau is my favourite Turaga of the six. That fact might seem a bit biased because green is my favourite colour, but I think that this guy is genuinely awesome.

Pros:
Colour scheme - emerald green and lime green
Nice mask
Saw
Green Toa heads

Cons:
NONE!

Turaga Matau is a really nice, cheap addition to any Bionicle collection and is a must have if you want to re-create Kohli matches.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-04-12T19:10:15.31Z","Really nice","I love this set, its small cheap and you have no diffulty building it, I really like the buzzsaw and the mask. It was my first bioncle along with Tahu. It goes well with lewa (2001).

Pros:
* mask
* buzzsaw

Cons:
* none",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Agent_Flex_the_Lego_lover","2008-09-16T18:28:51.687Z","Wonderful","This little guy was my very first bionicle set. He looks simple but he is louds of fun. When I first got him I knew nothing about the bionicle story. I did not even now that he had a mask, I thought it was just part of his hed. He has a very cool saw thing and he has a cool arm that goes up and down when moving the lever on his back. 

I love this set and I love bionicle altho it is not like it use to be but I still love it and anyone who dose not has more rock in his hed then a po matoran.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:30:32.607Z","Another Great mini Bionicle","Like all Turaga this one has the standard feet, hands, arm system, and head. What's better about this one is the mask is cooler (plus it has the power of mind control according to the guides) and the buzzsaw is the most fearsome of the six weapons: a torch, a trident, a hammer, an ice pick, a drill, and this (not much competition).

The rubberband frays, alright, a flaw...

Still a great set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 25 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 12 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for this little figure.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 legs and the arms can be adjusted. On the back of the torso you can 
also see a lever which moves the arm with the chain saw up and/or down. I 
also like the design of the mask which LEGO has chosen for this figure.<br></span></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
