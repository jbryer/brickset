The only prolem is that the rubberband on the back to make the thing go up and down looks like a liver (ewww!) But overall, this thing is not that bad considering that it is a small bionicle!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T12:36:49.34Z","Best turaga","The coolest turaga, have awesome colors, same of pohatu, and mata nui brown. I hope that these colors bring back, but, when it no happens, i use thes in creations. This is a little set, but have some features, like the toa mata heads and a stone hammer. It also have the noble version of the onewa's mask, good in all matoran. He isn't small than some turaga like nokama, but is small than the first toas.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:18:05.687Z","Tallest of the Turaga","Onewa is a really cool Turaaga. He is tan and dark brown, like Pohatu, and I really like that colour scheme. His hammer is the second best weapon of the all the Turaga.

Pros:
Cool hammer
Tall
Tan and dark brown
Brown Toa feet
Mask is quite cool - not as cool as Matau's

Cons:
NONE!

Turaga Onewa is a really great, cheap Bionicle that all must get.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-03-14T22:22:11.123Z","Turaga Onewa!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. These guys are the Turaga elders. The Turaga are former Toa who have sacrificed their Toa power for the greater good of the Matoran. They continue their lives as Turaga to help and guide the Matoran.

This is Turaga Onewa, protector of Pohatu's legend. His colour scheme is brown and cream with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Komau. The weapon he carries is the Stone Hammer.

Onewa is the tallest Turaga and consists of 29 pieces. His Stone Hammer is only used by one other set, 8553 (Pahrak Va) in LEGO making this piece quite uncommon. His mask is quite different to the Toa masks and is the same one used to infect the Manas.

I am aware the use of faces for feet has ranging comments over the Turaga. I personally don't mind them. Yes the Toa feet look better, but they are thick and stable so I cant complain.

Overall their aesthetics aren't as good as the Bionicle and their playability is weaker but this what you have to expect from a support model. They were very cheep in their day, made an excellent gift or stocking filler and helped expand Bionicle collections considerably. For this I feel this guy is a 6/10 or Above Average. Again this is mainly due to the awesome fun I had with them as a group. A must for any Bionical fan and a great way to expand your Bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Agent_Flex_the_Lego_lover","2008-07-22T18:40:32.67Z","Wonderful","Onewa was my second set (well sortove, I boght him at the same time I boght my first one). He has great play value even for those who dont know the bionicle story. His mask is very cool and so is his hammer, but sadly I lost the hammer (boo hoo sob cry wale). If you ever have the chance BUY him. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T11:29:32.937Z","The tall guy","I don't know why lego made this one taller then the rest of the Matorans but I think it small touches that make the early bionicles good without the need of creating dozens of diffeerent firing mechanisms. As always the weapon is cool and this mask has some nice little details on it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>

sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for this little figure.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 legs and the arms can be moved. On the back of the torso you can 
also see a lever which moves the arm with the hammer up and/or down. I

"BobaFett2","2010-09-03T00:20:12.087Z","The Best of the Turaga","Onewa was one of those Turaga whom I only had two of (or three, according to my brother). I recently recieved him free along with at least 20-40 (or more sets-some other noteworthy sets were the Rock Raiders Tunnel Transport, Royal Knights Castle, the Res-Q HQ and Cruiser, and a lot more) sets from my neighbor (5 years older than me, a great friend when I was young and my babysitter during the summer). That's how I got Onewa (he also had 2 Throwbots, a TECHNIC Pit Droid, 1 Roborider (Frost), and the six original Toa).<br><br>Anyways, that's the background of how I got it.<br><br>Onewa was released in 2001, as one of 6 Turaga. He was not necessarily my favorite, and there weren't many things I knew about him. The only ones I ever really learned about as a kid were Vakama, Nuju, and Nokama. I hadn't even read anything about him in a book as a turaga and the comics about him didn't really have him doing anything. However, now that I have him I find he's much better than he looks.<br><br>For parts, there's not much but he has two turaga feet, a nice mask, a nice head, and a hammer. The tan colors are also nice and a semi-rarity.<br><br>He's very playable for a set of his size. The building was decent, since it's small, but as always, the older BIONICLE sets (whose building I had memorized) continue to surprise me.<br><br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Mask, Head, and Hammer</li><li>Nice Tan Colors<br>Great for a turaga</li><li>Good for a BIONICLE collection, not too much on bricklink</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Have to buy him online since he's been out for a while, not as good a price as before</li><li>Not a lot of parts</li></ul><br>Overall, this is a great set, and if you have the money and the want (sometimes it's nostalgia), then get him. Otherwise, I'd suggest saving your money unless you find him at 5 dollars or less. Then buy him.<br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
