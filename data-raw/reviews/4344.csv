"Gus_263","2008-02-22T12:20:14.483Z","Good for a turaga","A good set, specially by the colors and the trident staff. A small weapon, but looks like cool. The feet are the same of turaga, toa mata heads. These are blue, and the arms and legs, light blue. Nokama as turaga don't looks like toa nokama, only the mask. But it don't makes the turaga uncool. Great, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-03-14T22:33:38.873Z","Turaga Nokama!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. These guys are the Turaga elders. The Turaga are former Toa who have sacrificed their Toa power for the greater good of the Matoran. They continue their lives as Turaga to help and guide the Matoran.

This is Turaga Nokama , protector of Gali's legend. Her colour scheme is light and dark blue with a touch of black. Her mask is the Kanohi Rau. The weapon she carries is a Fork Shaped Staff (Trident).

Nokama is the third smallest Turaga and consists of 27 pieces. Her Fork Shaped Staff is only found in blue, in this set, in LEGO, making this piece rare. It is found two more times once in black and once in dark grey. Her mask is quite different to the Toa masks and is quite plain compared to the detail of the others masks.

I am aware the use of faces for feet has ranging comments over the Turaga. I personally don't mind them. Yes the Toa feet look better, but they are thick and stable so I cant complain.

Overall their aesthetics aren't as good as the Bionicle and their playability is weaker but this what you have to expect from a support model. They were very cheep in their day, made an excellent gift or stocking filler and helped expand Bionicle collections considerably. For this I feel this guy is a 6/10 or Above Average. Again this is mainly due to the awesome fun I had with them as a group. A must for any Bionical fan and a great way to expand your Bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:23:59.81Z","Ripply mask and trident","Turaga Nokama is my lest favourite Turaga. The trident is about the only cool thing on her in my opinion. The ripply-wave mask does kinda make it look like it has some connection to the sea, but it doesn't really do anything to me except make me weep.

Pros:
Trident
Dark blue Toa heads

Cons: (where do I start?)
Mask is dumb
Light blue not dark blue
Arms are too long and look weird on her
No X-factor

Nokama is cheap so it would make sense to get her but don't be surprised if you don't like her.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T16:09:53.967Z","Pitchfork","Why does this matoran have a pitchfork is what I first thought but then I realised that it was actually rather clever because the greek god of something has a pitchfork (I think) and these people are supposed to be the water people. This guys mask looks nice and smooth and I allways thought that the Matorans design was clever.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 27 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for what we get here.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 legs and the arms can be moved. On the back of the torso you can 
also see a lever which moves the arm with the trident up and/or down. I 
also like the design of the mask we get for this figure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
