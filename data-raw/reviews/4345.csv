"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-07T20:32:05.81Z","???","The hands can't pick up anything, and he is holding a pick axe, or whatever it is. His mask looks so weird, with a square head. what disturbs me the most is that the feet are bionicle heads(You know, take off the mask and the head)...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-03-15T02:01:08.89Z","Turaga Nuju!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. These guys are the Turaga elders. The Turaga are former Toa who have sacrificed their Toa power for the greater good of the Matoran. They continue their lives as Turaga to help and guide the Matoran.

This is Turaga Nuju, protector of Kopaka's legend. His colour scheme is grey and white with a touch of black. His mask is the Kanohi Matatu. The weapon he carries is an Ice Pick.

Nuju is the third tallest Turaga and consists of 29 pieces. His Ice Pick is only used in this set making this piece rare. His mask is quite different to the Toa masks and this one looks the strangest and most alien.

I am aware the use of faces for feet has ranging comments over the Turaga. I personally don't mind them. Yes the Toa feet look better, but they are thick and stable so I cant complain.

Overall their aesthetics aren't as good as the Bionicle and their playability is weaker but this what you have to expect from a support model. They were very cheep in their day, made an excellent gift or stocking filler and helped expand Bionicle collections considerably. For this I feel this guy is a 6/10 or Above Average. Again this is mainly due to the awesome fun I had with them as a group. A must for any Bionical fan and a great way to expand your Bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T12:06:58.497Z","Of Metru nui to Mata Nui","The turaga in mata nui are smaller than the metru. But they are cool, and have good colors, different of they's toa colors. The hand can't pick-up some things, but are cool to use any staff. The feet are toa mata heads with awesome colors. In the Nuju set, they are white. The mask is the same of various matoran.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T12:16:06.653Z","the same","This guy is the same as most of the other Matorans and nothing but his weapon, mask and colour scheme makes him special. But I gave this set a 4 because I'm reviewing the set and not the series. The ice pick looks very real. The mask looks more like a proper mask than any othe set does.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-24T11:11:14.687Z","He's Alright","Like I said, he's alright, but he's not very playable.  At all.  He can't move his head (like any of the early Bionicles) and his left arm droops.  His right arm (the one that holds the pick) can snap downward using a rubber band, so that saves him from a 3/5.  His mask looks kinda weird and alien, and I must say he's kinda fat.  So, what are the statistics?

Pros:

Snapping pick

At least arms and legs can actually MOVE

Cons:

Weird Mask of Telekinesis

Drooping arm

He's fat

Not playable at all

So, if you're a play with your Bionicles and don't really care about the storyline, then don't get him.  If you like to just set them up and keep them just for collection, then get him.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:32:27.7Z","Cool - excuse the pun","Turaga Nuju is my third favourite Turaga. His pickaxe is really cool and is the third best weapon of all Turaga weapons.

Pros:
Mask is great
Pickaxe
White Toa heads

Cons:
Grey not full white

Other than that colour con, Turaga Nuju is a great and cheap Bionicle. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 29 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for a figure like this.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 legs and the arms can be moved. On the back of the torso you can 
also see a lever which moves the arm with the pickaxe up and/or down. I 
also like the design of the mask we get for this figure.<br></span></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
