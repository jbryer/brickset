"legocarnut2","2007-11-26T11:10:54.7Z","Tiny hunchback of Onu Wahi","I got this set free with all of the original turarga and toa. he is small. Very small. Very simple (what did you expect, the guy is 26 pecies!) He is a hunch back gtoo. His mask is cool though. Very old wise and hunchbacky looking, if that makes any sense whatsoever. I like his drill-dtaff thingy though. I think that the idea of thenm using toa heads without the brain stem for feet was a pretty smart idea. I like the effect his head has with the black head and the green eyes. Not as cool as Ownewa's head but still cool. He also comes with a wimpy rubber band fuction that moves his right arm. Over all a O:K set if you can find him free because i sure as heck would not spend money on this dude! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The eyes color don't glows very, but in light color heads can be cool. The weapon, a little drill in staff, is in the black color, being a good option for little weapons.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:13:05.5Z","Dwarf","Turaga Whenua is the shortest Turaga, being just a little shorter than Matau. His drill/thingy staff is quite cool and the mask is pretty good. But he is kinda short, even though Matau is almost as short as him.

Pros:
Earth Turaga
Drill/thingy staff
Mask

Cons:
Monotonous colours
Kinda short

Overall Turaga Whenua gets a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-03-15T02:12:23.92Z","Turaga Whenua!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. These guys are the Turaga elders. The Turaga are former Toa who have sacrificed their Toa power for the greater good of the Matoran. They continue their lives as Turaga to help and guide the Matoran.

This is Turaga Whenua, protector of Onua's legend. His colour scheme is grey and  black. His mask is the Kanohi Ruru. The weapon he carries is the Drill of Onua.

Whenua is the smallest Turaga and consists of 27 pieces. His Drill is used in a few sets now, due to the newer Mars range and isn't as rare as the other Turaga's weapons. His mask is quite different to the Toa masks and this one looks the coolest and is the one I would say is my favourite Turaga Mask.

I am aware the use of faces for feet has ranging comments over the Turaga. I personally don't mind them. Yes the Toa feet look better, but they are thick and stable so I cant complain.

Overall their aesthetics aren't as good as the Bionicle and their playability is weaker but this what you have to expect from a support model. They were very cheep in their day, made an excellent gift or stocking filler and helped expand Bionicle collections considerably. For this I feel this guy is a 6/10 or Above Average. Again this is mainly due to the awesome fun I had with them as a group. A must for any Bionical fan and a great way to expand your Bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:33:45.153Z","Yet another great mini Bioncle set","Yes, another Turaga (getting kind of old with six similar structures, but hey atleast they are different). This one is also less fearsom, but at least a sub-lethal weapon... The structure is near identical, except for the pose and height, this guy is a midget compared to the others, but his mask is pretty cool! A great set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T16:13:19.92Z","the midget","This is the smallest Matoran ans this is clever because Onua also was slightly shorter then all of the other Toa. It still makes him look a bit like a hunchback which wasn't so much of a problem. These 2 points cancel each other out soo I'll just give it the same score that I gave every other Matoran.

"Zatth","2013-04-23T19:57:06.503Z","Whenua: The wise Turaga of Onu-Koro","<p>Whenua is one of the six small Turaga sets that were released in 2001. This set is now somewhat rare, and a great prize to any collection. I purchased my copy from Bricklink for only 5.00 USD - a good deal for the size and relative value of the set.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Story value: In the Bionicle story, Turaga Whenua is the Turaga of the village of Earth, Onu-Koro, on the island of Mata Nui. He is a pretty important character in the storyline. Along with his powers and collectable mask, this makes him a set that is greatly valued by the Bionicle community (this can enhance his playability, if you're feeling imaginative).<br></li><li>Size: Whenua is the smallest of the Turaga, making him a great pocket-sized model. He is one of the few Bionicles that can really be transported easily.<br></li><li>Unique build: Whenua has an unusual and unique design: unlike the other Turaga, his head is hunched forward, over his body. This complements <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8532-1"">Toa Onua</a> nicely - the early Bionicle characters related to the element of Earth tended to be hunched and short (to make it easier to move through narrow tunnels and caves).<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Poseability: Whenua doesn't have a particularly good range of motion, much like many other early Bionicle sets. This will be alright to some, but may bother others.<br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, Turaga Whenua is a cheap, fun, valuable supplement to your Lego collection - you won't regret getting him!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
