These tunes really bring back memories, and the composition is great. You'll get a kick out of the climatic, high-energy music. I only wish there was more than three songs

The ultra-rare silver Hau olda is a nice collector's item (I think I still have it somewhere...) but the Tohunga is sort of blah.

The software isn't as good as the free software disks that came with the original Toa, but it's still fun. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-15T07:20:57.48Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - BIONICLE Power Pack Review","<p>This is a great figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 9 pieces and for my surprise it was 15 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 167 cents per piece which is really overpriced. But I think that's because we also got a CD in it...<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8546-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This legs and the arms can be adjusted. One arm can also shoot a disc which comes with this set. This figure may doesn't do much but it's still fun to maneuver it. We also get an exclusive kanohi hau mask.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
