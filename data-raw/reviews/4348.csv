They are very easy to build and have a high level of &quot;playability&quot; They have this little trigger that if you pull it the tail will snap down rreeeeeeeeaaaalyy fast and hard. A friend of mine can attest to that. It gave him a little tiny bruise. What's cool is that there is 2 in the set so you can make them battle. It's also great if you have a Toa ( for obvious reasons) because you can make them battle each other, although the Nui-Jaga usally wins. All in all a sturdy set that comes with 4 limited edition masks for you mask colletors out there.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The black is in the two, but one have light blue and other purple. They don't have claws, but two pakari masks in each. They also have a tail in each other.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The tail is well reinforced and after all my time playing with these guys they never broke. The masks are a nice touch and it's cool how they have two in one set to either tag-team up against the Toa (or if they are feeling extra harsh then the Matorans) or just fight each other this set was desinged perfectly and as both a set and toy for playing or displaying, it is awesome.

"peahats","2009-11-29T16:42:24.187Z","Bionicle Rahi: Nui-Jaga","This set comes with two Nui-Jaga one is blue with red eyes and the other is purple with yellow eyes. they are both built the same way except for the colors. There is a trigger on the undersides of the scorpions, and when it is pressed their head retracts and their tails swing forward. On each of their claws is a Onua mask, if the tail from the other Nui-Jaga hits the mask it will fall off. They can combine into a bird rahi that has an opening jaw.

Pros:

1 Two Nui-Jaga
2 Special pieces 
3 Great playability
4 Combined model
5 easy but fun build

Cons:

None that I can Think of",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
