The building isn't so long but it takes a hour and an half.
Pushing two yellow pieces on the back, you can move their arms. 
The goal of the game is ,hitting the kanohi of the opponent , make it falling down.
The set is really cool. If you find it your should get it because it is worth .",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"chavez365","2009-11-08T12:44:26.233Z","Fantastic Set!","I was feeling kind of bored over the weekend, so I decided to take this set out of the cupboard that has been its home for approximately three years and build it. Eventually, I discovered that too many pieces were missing for me to build both, so I just decided to build the blue one, as the mask for the aqua Tarakava was missing anyway. Does that mean this set was a flop because I couldn`t build both? One word:NO! 
This set was not only fun too build, it`s fun to play with, too. I finally got sucked in to the building process of the set, a feeling that I hadn`t had for a pretty long time. Every time I added a new piece, I quivered, knowing that I was one step closer to completing a surely fantastic set. But, back to the set itself. As I was saying, the build was very fun, and I`m sure building the second one would have been just as much fun, especially as it looks like there are a couple of differences. So, in a nutshell, the building experience was unbelievable.
Now to the playability. There`s lots of it here, I`ll assure you of that. It is one of life`s most pleasant experiences to have a monster on treads shoot up to another Bionicle(particularly Brutaka, who`s height makes him the perfect punching bag for old Tarky here) and punch the living daylights out of him. And Tarky, as I have affectionally named him, has a special move that works with certain Bionicles, such as the Rahkshi: if you punch them in a certain spot, the little ""fist"" will keep hold of Tarky`s sparring partner and draw him towards you. Punch again and your amigo will fly away from you like a rag doll. Be warned though, it might give Mohamed Ali a.k.a. Tarky a serious hernia. Whilst beating up Guuhrak, Tarky`s arm came off! So, to answer your question, yes. Tarky is INCREDIBLY fun to play with.
Now, for Tarky`s final grade. Out of ten, this big guy gets a score of 19.6! With an incredibly enjoyable build and hours-no, wait, DAYS- of fun, Tarky really makes me wish that Bionicle made more guys like him. But sadly, the days of Tarky and his never built partner, and the surely amazing Nui-Rama and Nui-Jaga, as well as others like the Bahrag Twins, are over. The good thing is, if you`ve got one of these guys, two words: guaranteed fun.
Here are Tarky`s amazing final scores:
Playability: 29/10
Building: 13/10
Overall: 19.6/10
Should I Get It?: Hmmmmm, how about... 50/10? Particularly as YOU`LL get two! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I Bought the set used, so I don't have the box, but the instructions are really good! and it also includes a cool alternate model.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set include many great parts! there are example lots of parts that have exclusive color to this set, and overal good amount and technical parts to experiment with making your own ceatures.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>it was a really fun set to build! the build wasn't to short and it wasn't to long either, but it is a bit boring to buld almost the same two times.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Two awesome creatures with similar but still very different color style. They have a great playability, with strong powerful arms that you can use to knock of the other's Kanohi. You also have the ability to dogde attacks and use strategies.</p><p>Some may be against me about this, but they just look so cool! the shape of the creature is amazing. They look both horrifying and awesome at the same time!</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>With the great color's, the cool construction, the great functions, and the awesome look. This is one of my favorite Lego sets of all time. I would say it's a must have for every Bionicle/Technic fan</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"logeybear","2014-11-24T04:43:10.933Z","My All-Time Favorite BIONICLE Set!","<p>What is a Tarakava you ask?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s basically an aquatic lizard creature that fights by jumping out of the water and punching it&rsquo;s victim&rsquo;s masks off.&nbsp; It sounds dumb, but man does it ever make for an amazing set.&nbsp; This is the BIONICLE set I spent most of my childhood playing with.&nbsp; It takes the whole mask fighting game to the next level by basically turning your sets into Rock-em Sock-em Robots. &nbsp;Instead of awkwardly swinging a Toa&rsquo;s arm to knock masks off, you took a rubber-band loaded arm and smacked the other guy&rsquo;s Tarakava in the face with the magnitude of an AK-47.&nbsp; Yeah, these guys could pack a wallop and it made you wonder how the Toa ever stood a chance against them.&nbsp; The launchers of modern BIONICLE figures pale in comparison to the quick, hard hitting punching function of the Tarakava.&nbsp; Aside from having the best playability of every BIONICLE set I have ever owned, the Tarakava comes with some rare recolored TECHNIC panels and masks.&nbsp; You get a few teal and classic blue parts that are a nice bonus.&nbsp; The main complaint many fans have with this set is the lack of articulation, but I feel this set doesn&rsquo;t need any.&nbsp; He just rolls around on a massive tread and punches things in the face.&nbsp; LEGO was even kind enough to add a shock absorber between the treads and the hand grips, which just shows how much effort and care they used to put into BIONICLE/TECHNIC sets.&nbsp; Personally, I would love it if LEGO produced more of these types of figures in the future for additional&nbsp;generations of kids to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-15T18:36:02.787Z","A personal favorite","<p>The Tarakava are hands-down my favourite Rahi set from 2001. They take the concept of knocking an opponent&#39;s mask off (as advertised with the Rahi sets) to a whole new level. Their function involves punching, and they do this very well. This mix of Technic, System, and Bionicle provides a great build, and the fact that this set comes with two Tarakava only sweetens the deal.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Punching function works very well.</p>

<p>Both Tarakava feature masks in new colours (Pakari in blue, and Kakama in turquoise).</p>

<p>Has technic shock absorber pieces in the base to aim for low and high targets.</p>

<p>Both of the Tarakava have kickstand-like attachments, so they can stand or be displayed.</p>

<p>Noses have shock absorbers that, when hit, will expose the mask and allow it to be knocked off.</p>

<p>Contains turquoise pieces (rare colour).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The spines made up of system&nbsp;bricks make the Tarakava look thinner in their midsections.</p>

<p>The rubber bands aren&#39;t of good quality.</p>

<p>The arms can begin to slide off&nbsp;of&nbsp;the pins that they are attached to.</p>

<p>The Tarakava are awesome, and are a cheaper option compared to some other Rahi sets. Due to the fact that this set has a great function, contains numerous new pieces and is a 2-pack, I&#39;d say for both fans new and old, this set is a must-have. 5/5</p>
