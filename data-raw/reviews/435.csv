"Wells","2009-04-23T23:21:28.497Z","Semi-Compatible","Yes, this is a simple set with just a cross piece and a number of straight rails, but it was quite useful for certain track layouts.

And I beg to differ on the incompatibility.... they are semi-compatible with later rail sets like the RC based ones. Yes, there is a bit of a gap between rails, but it is possible to link the older blue rails with the new generation of L-Scale rails.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
