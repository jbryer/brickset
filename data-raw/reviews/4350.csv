Trips to the toy store in the village adjacent to ours were, in retrospect, much too few and far between.  I know they had little Matchbox-scale cars for sale because I bought some, but everything else failed to make the memory register, as they had an outstanding Lego collection.  A few months after thinking that the 855 was no longer available, one showed up in their store, and I got lucky â€“ I just happened to be there the very first day that it was on display, and snapped it up (along with the 856 bulldozer).  This was in the summer of 1982.  

What a great kit.  The main model was a lot of fun, and got a lot of play with the 856.  Combining the 855 with the 8848 unimog resulted in a crane with a larger, sturdier platform (it helped to first lengthen the wheelbase of the 8848), sort of a precursor to the 8854 utility truck.  The 855 has lots of good pieces, is plenty of fun and is a must-have.  10/10.  28 April 2004",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2009-01-12T19:36:00.403Z","Fun to build and fun to play with once built!","This is one of the first sets I received as a youngster, and it is still just as fun to build and operate today.

The build is somewhat complex for younger minds and requires special attention to detail and concentration on spacial skills, but that is part of the fun for me.

When the build is complete the fun continues as there are three wheels controlling 1) the vertical position of the arm, 2) the extension of the arm and 3) the raising and lowering of the cable.  The model functions well, although when bringing the boom in from its full extension the hook will automatically lower as the boom gets shorter.

The biggest problem with this model is the narrow wheelbase.  The crane is not as stable as it should be as a result, and the stabilizers (that must be taken apart and reassembled for each use) are of little use.  The crane would be capable of lifting an exceptional amount of weight were it not for its tendency to get tipsy.  A good solution would be to combine this set with another one to double the length of the chassis.  I think there was an Idea Book that showed such a modification.

Over all this is an excellent early Technic set, and it includes instructions for a nifty dump truck too.

<p>As a biggish model from the first generation of technic sets, this crane has much to commend it. A great selection of parts, those nice chunky wheels and a good model at the end of a rewarding build.</p>
<p>Most of it's problems stem from Lego having skimped a bit on the chassis design. I guess they didn't want it to tread on the toes of the 853 car for size, but it would have benefited greatly from a longer chassis with at least six wheels. Throw in a steered axle and you would have had the most playable and versatile of all the early sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always thought it strange that Lego didn't pass an axle through the three toggles that form the lower hook to rectify the most glaring weakness (easily done of course..) but the rest of it was strong enough, if a bit unstable when loaded.</p>
<p>Having said that, this is a fine little crane, able to lift a decent weight and it works very well, although lifting the boom is slightly awkward - it could have done with another set of gears to make operation smoother.</p>
<p>If all this sounds a bit harsh, it's just that I always thought the other early sets were better thought out.</p>",TRUE,3,4,5,3,4

For a 12 year old, getting two large Lego <em>Technical</em> sets in two days changed my play experience with Lego for ever.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I still have the original instructions although missing the cover page. The box has long gone</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This model was one of the first Lego <em>Technical</em> sets and introduced me to the universal joint,&nbsp;24 tooth crown- and gear wheel,&nbsp;rack and pinion. Most of the set is studded bricks. The 16x1&nbsp;technic beams suffered through hard play but I have recently replaced them with parts sourced from <a href=""http://spareblocks.com/"" style=""color: rgb(6, 144, 214); font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">Spareblocks.com</a><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); line-height: 22.39px; font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"">The build</span></h3>

<p>My two original Technic models were played with extensively and I made a variety&nbsp;of models combining the parts with normal Lego bricks. Today, Technic Lego is almost exclusively studless&nbsp;while the original <em>Technical</em> models easily crossed over with conventional building bricks.</p>

<p>I used the crane wheels doubled up as front wheels for dragsters and cars with the big wheels from my 857 motor cycle on the rear.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The main issue with this model is that the wheels do not steer. The model drives in straight lines only.</p>

<p>The outriggers are there for show only and do not do any real supporting. There are four 2x2&nbsp;red plate pads which are stored in the two lockers on the side of the chassis.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2895/14664145034_88ab37d112.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The <em>hook</em>&nbsp;has always been a bit strange in that it is weakly constructed and relys on friction to keep things from falling.</p>

<p>That being said, the crane works well, the boom lifts up easily and telescopes out to nearly twice the length.</p>

<p>The three functions,&nbsp;<em>luffing, extending </em>and<em> hoisting</em> are controlled by the three steering wheels and their crank handles. There is a regular Lego turntable with a bearing ring of 2x2 tiles so the cab can slew around smoothly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have kept my Lego and I am pleased to have obtained replacement parts for those pieces lost or cracked.</p>

<p>This model is functional&nbsp;as a crane and takes a pride place next to my 857 motor cycle side car.</p>
