<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 26 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 12 cents per piece which is a good 
value for what we get here!<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8550-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The
 arms, the head, the feet and the torso can be moved. On one hand you
 can see a claw which LEGO used for Toa Mata Gali. The back has a piece
 where you can put a krana in, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T18:00:53.557Z","Bohrok Va = Matoran","<p>Set #8550 Gahlok Va: I aquired these sets from the local 7-Eleven, which surprised me at the time because I wasn't used to finding LEGO sets in a convenience store. So I chose to purchase all six of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gahlok Va is meant to be a companion to Gahlok, he or she (not sure if it is meant to be female.) is a small impulse set that uses limited pieces to build a model the size of the Matoran perhaps to be their enemies or nemesis. I never actually checked into the model's backstory on LEGO's Bionicle site, if they had any info. The Bohrok Va as a set are actually quite interesting looking and the pieces are useful for building up MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the pieces and the instructions the Gahlok Va also included a small fold-out poster which showed Gahlok next to Gahlok Va in action poses. Overall despite being some interesting little sets I don't think they're must owns for Bionicle collections. Still if you're interested in these little sets or looking for cheap Bionicle pieces these are a good source for parts. And it also comes with a Krana.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
