The eyes seem too big for its head, which makes it look kinda cartoony. And the Bohrok teeth for hooks make it seem like Gali Jr. or something. Overall, it's so cute that it's sure to become famous! Oh, and by the way, the mask doodad is called a Krana.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-25T09:02:03.39Z","Good companion for Kohrak","He's small, cute, and pretty posable and playable despite his size.  I like the picks in his hands and the way you can catapult the Krana on his back.  The head can turn in any direction, and can move up and down as well.  So, in a nutshell, what does this little guy score?

Pros:

Picks

One arm can move up and down, while the other catapults the Krana

Head is very posable

You can move his body to crouch, sit, and stand upright

Good companion to Kohrak

Cons:

Big feet

So, all in all, he scores a five out of five.  Thanks for reading!! :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T18:06:49.58Z","Kohrok Va stands ready to assist Kohrok","<p>Set #8551 Kohrok Va: The Bohrok Va were all pretty much the same basic model, the only things which changed were the colors, the head piece and the Krana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kohrok Va, in fact all Bohrok Va have interesting looking aesthethics. However the models can not stand straight as the Krana will fall out of their back flipping panels if you try to stand them up straight. The pieces are useful though as spares for the larger Bohrok or if you wanted to you could try and combine all six of them into a deadly gestalt. (The instructions don't indicate this though.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said though you can do without these little impulse sets in your collection if you're looking to trim area for space or something.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 28 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a good 
value for a figure like this!<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8551-1.jpg[/img]</span></span></span><br></span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The
 arms, the head, the feet and the torso can be moved. On both hands you
 can see a pickaxe which LEGO used as teeth for the bohrok figures. The back of the bohrok va has a piece
 where you can put a krana in as well. I really can't complain about this little figure - even if this set doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
