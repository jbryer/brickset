"Gus_263","2008-02-20T15:11:01.45Z","Another Va review","It's very cool for a little set. Like the va, are different comparing to the turaga. The head isn't symetrical, but it is great, and is maded with a shield, to like the green bohrok. Also includes a Krana. You can think that these little sets aren't awesome, but, can be using at creations. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T13:22:56.357Z","I lost his grey swords...","But I replaced them with black ones.  So, he's a good set, and a good companion for Lehvak (see review on Kohrak Va).  I like how one arm moves up and down and the other launches the Krana through the air.  The color scheme looks a lot like Lehvak, and I like how Lego used Lehvak's tools as a head.  Stats:

Pros:

-One arm moves up and down

-One arm launches Krana

-Matches with Lehvak

-Big feet

Cons:

-Krana falls out of cradle (fix this with a rubber band lol)

-Head can't pivot from side to side, but you can modify that

Go get Lehvak and Lehvak Va today!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-02T10:27:05.853Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Bohrok Va) - Lehvak Va Review","<div class=""description""><div class=""description""><p>This is a nice little figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 28 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a good 
value for this little figure!<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8552-1.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The
 arms, the head, the feet and the torso can be adjusted. On both hands you
 can see a ninja sword. The back has a piece
 where you can put a krana in, too. I really can't complain about this little figure - even if this set doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T18:11:24.113Z","Lehvak Va the Ninja","<p>Set #8552 Lehvak Va: This particular set is actually a good bet even if you aren't interested in impulse sets because it includes two extra ninja swords for your Mini-Figures... Of course then Lehvak Va won't have any hands, but that's what MOCing is for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't much else to say really about this set. If you're into Bionicle enough to want to own every single set then great, but if you're just a casual fan then you can skip the Bohrok Va, but you might still want to get this one as I said because you get two ninja swords with it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
