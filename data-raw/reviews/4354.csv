But it have a krana carried at it's back, and a head maded with a very symmetrical shield. The eye color and the classic brown are very notable in this little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 27 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a good 
value for this little figure!<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 arms, the head, the feet and the torso can be adjusted. On one hand you
 can see a hammer which LEGO used for turaga Onewa. The back of the bohrok va has a piece
 where you can put a krana in, too. I really can't complain about this little set - even if this set doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pahrak Va comes with a miniature hammer piece, I'm not sure if it was unique to him, but it wasn't common that's for sure. Aside from unique weapons and unique Krana though the rest of the pieces are all identical, when disassembling these sets for storage you have to be careful not to mix them up. I said before that Lehvak Va is one you should pick up, I think Pahrak Va is also a must have due to his weapon. It may not be Mini-Figure compatible, but it is a great Technic piece to use with other Bionicle sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
