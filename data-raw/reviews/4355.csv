The only thing good about this set are its parts. I would only buy this set if you had spare change.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

(Also, his staff is cool) This guy is a must have, and he is very cheap. He is one of my favorites besides the blue one.",FALSE,5,4,2,4,3

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 27 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on sale. The price per piece ratio was 11 cents per piece which is a good value for a figure like this!<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8554-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the head, the feet and the torso can be adjusted. On one hand you can see a staff which LEGO used for Turaga Vakama. The back has a piece where you can put a krana in.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T18:19:46.613Z","Flame On!","<p>Set #8554 Tahnok Va: Red pieces and red flame staff, that's the best aspect of this set. Tahnok Va is a fun little model for fiddling with and you really should try to MOC with these sets. Because there is a lot of fun potential for MOCing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Bohrok Va sets are overall still low on the scale of bricks for sets. I give them all a three out of five because their dollar value really and the fact that you can use their pieces in alternative builds. And some of them include very impressive looking weapons in Technic scale to use with other figures.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
