The shield is symetrical and the colors are cool, of the eyes and body. It also includes a Krana on back. The tohunga feet are great, and it is awesome and different comparising with a turaga.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 26 pieces and it was 3 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 12 cents per piece which is a good 
value for a figure like this!<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 arms, the head, the feet and the torso can be adjusted. On both hands you
 can see a claw which LEGO used for Toa Mata Onua. The back of the bohrok va has a piece
 where you can put a krana in as well. I really can't complain about this small figure - even if this set doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T18:23:51.757Z","Savage Claw Mode!","<p>Set #8555 Nuvok Va: Ah yes Nuvok Va, those wonderful looking Technic three-clawed hands. I really dig those pieces, they have so much potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's something I completely forgot about these sets when reviewing the others, all of the models are simple and straight forward to build, they also all have gimmicks. Basically you attach their Krana holding backpacks to one of their arms and when you pull it down you can launch their Krana at a Toa or Matoran enemy. These launchers get a fair bit of distance too when you put enough oomph into them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I've said before though you can easily skip most of these sets for your Bionicle collection if you want. They aren't a necessity.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
