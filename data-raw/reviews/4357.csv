I remember that it somehow moved like a tank, and threw out punches like a &quot;boxer&quot;. I drove my sister crazy by doing this. Where is it? I don't know. It must be with all my Misc legos and i probably took a part. I will still treasure this set in my heart...always...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set isn't too big, include a vehicle and a matoran, but it is cool to play because the vehicle have functions (different to some others, like vultraz, that shoots midak only). This vehicle have bohrok itens, and can moves and hit with the hooks included in the gali set. The matoran can also shoots disks, like the promotional included in mcdonald's.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"carl_thee_cow","2009-02-13T23:13:25.53Z","Awesome :)","This set is very unique. It includes an old matoran and a machine with moving arms. This is a machine the matoran of Onu-koro built to fight back against the borohk. it has a very nice black-gray-orange color sceem. i like that it uses borohk parts in the construction. (prehaps from captured borohk?) Any way this is a great set if you can find it buy it.

"TransformR","2009-06-05T07:47:05.17Z","Why have an old Matoran in this????","story-wise this seems appropreate because the Borock ARE vehicles for the krana. In other words Perfect idea: use downed borock parts for somrthing to fight them with.


Pros:exelent idea
nice use of borock parts

Cons: Old matoran",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"GBP_Chris","2013-01-03T18:00:46.767Z","""I'll call this something you Bohrok monsters will remember ... BOXOR!""","When you're trapped within the city of Onu-Koro with over 300 tons of rock blocking your way out, you gotta think of something. And when you're looking for an old BIONICLE set with good parts and an important character, you gotta think of something. The Boxor is the answer to both questions.<h4><br>Price:</h4><div>Originally this sold in the US for $15, 12.99 in the British Pound. The only place you'll find Boxors these days is either at your friend's house or eBay. Be prepared to pay anywhere near $30 for a Boxor on eBay. It's&nbsp;pricey, but it's worth it.</div><div><br></div><h4>Instructions:</h4><div>If you manage after all these years to get a Boxor in a box, how in Mata Nui did you do that? My set didn't come in a box, so I won't review that. The instructions have no errors and include some cool pictures in the back of the Bahrag, the Toa Nuva, and etc. Very easy to follow, which is helpful since the Boxor has a harder build.<br><br></div><h4>Build/Pieces:</h4><div>The pieces included allow you to build Nuparu, 2nd Class Tunnel Engineer from Onu-Koro. His arms are both the same disk-throwing design, no building mistake here. His mask is a rarer one, so that's always nice to have. The rest of the pieces are either classic Technic, or parts that you could (almost) build a Bohrok with. Those are always nice pieces to have. If you don't care about Bionicle but just want Technic pieces, this includes a nice supply.</div><div>The build is more challenging than your average set with a great use of gears, rubber bands and other cool engineering style pieces. Nuparu would be proud. :D&nbsp;Definitely&nbsp;for more advanced builders as it requires a lot of Technic building techniques.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Play:</h4></div><div>Pressing the legs down makes the Boxor punch at enemies, whether Bohrok or Rahi. It's an impressive function, to say the least. If you like rebuilding and making alternate models, it has a nice array of pieces to construct something new.</div><div><br></div><h4>What I like:</h4><div><ul><li>Nuparu is a great character to have.</li><li>The Bohrok pieces that make up the Boxor are great.</li><li>Build and function are impressive in the completed model.</li></ul><h4>What I didn't like:</h4></div><div><ul><li>Pricing: It is next to impossible to find a Boxor under $20 for sale. Be prepared to pay a larger sum.</li></ul><div>Overall, 4/5, highly recommend this set if you can find it.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4

I have to say, I've wanted this set since i knew it came out. I mostly wanted Naparu, but the set is a great addition, as he walks around Mata Nui in his little vehicle. The function wiith the punchers was a neat trick, though if it has nothing to fight, it's a bummer. Overall, I highly recomend this set to any Bionicle fan and anyone else :)",FALSE,5,5,5,4,5
"logeybear","2014-11-24T04:44:49.493Z","Mandatory BIONICLE Set","<p>The Boxer was like a discount Exo-Toa back in &rsquo;02, only it surpassed the suit in terms of both playablility and price.&nbsp; It served as a Matoran add-on to defend the villagers from Bohrok when the Toa were off fighting the Bahrag.&nbsp; And at came with some really good parts.&nbsp; The whole idea of the Boxor in the storyline was simple.&nbsp; Nuparu and some of his fellow villagers were caught in a cave when their underground village flooded.&nbsp; To pass the time, Nuparu tinkered with some Bohrok armor, eventually turning it into a mech that he used to escape.&nbsp; The suits proved very effective at fighting the Bohrok swarms and the invention was a success, with the Matoran taking their Boxors to Metru Nui after the island was rediscovered.&nbsp; This set has so many things going for it I don&rsquo;t know where to begin, so I&rsquo;ll begin with construction.&nbsp; First off, this is a very TECHNIC heavy set.&nbsp; However, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it complicated.&nbsp; All you do is build some legs, an internal gear system, and some arms, and you&rsquo;re done.&nbsp; The Boxor rides the line of being more complicated than a standard Toa Mata or Bohrok but noticeably less complicated than the massive Exo-Toa and Bahrag.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s at just the right difficulty level that I think an elementary school-aged child and a preteen can enjoy.&nbsp; In other words, the perfect introductory TECHNIC set to get for a child who might be into robots.&nbsp; Next is the playability.&nbsp; Let me just start out by saying that I spent hours upon hours punching my Toa&rsquo;s masks off with friends with this set as a kid.&nbsp; It was just so much fun because the Boxor&rsquo;s play feature was so versatile.&nbsp; With the Toa, you had to stick your had on its back and turn the gear to fight, but with the Boxor, all you had to do was push down on either its left or right side to make it jab its hook at a lightning pace.&nbsp; Plus, the Boxor never fell down.&nbsp; My Bohrok and Toa always would, and it annoyed me.&nbsp; The Boxor had a nice, solid base to keep it standing upright during rough play.&nbsp; Another feature worth noting is the fact that all McDonald&rsquo;s promo Matoran can fit inside to fight (I would always switch out my Nuparu for Huki and Maku).&nbsp; Overall, I think the Boxor is perfectly designed for the target audience and does everything the classic BIONICLE sets set out to do.&nbsp; I was lucky and got mine when they were still affordable (it had a golden 9.55c price per piece ratio in 2002), now you will probably end up spending at least $30 to get this set.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Boxor is a quality product and mandatory for BIONICLE collectors and highly recommended for general LEGO collectors.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-04-11T03:45:21.69Z","Meet the engineer (Nuparu)","<p>How is Nuparu gonna stop some big mean Bohrok from tearing him a structurally superfluous new behind? The answer? This awesome mech that allows any Matoran to launch a pesky Bohrok across the cityscape with just one punch. This is one of two mech sets that came out in 2002, and despite the Exo Toa being much larger, I prefer this set without a doubt. It&#39;s just a fun set that looks good and has a technic function that works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nuparu:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pakari mask (Onua) is new in orange.</p>

<p>Although the set does not come with a disk, the disk throwing arm works great.</p>

<p>Fits snugly on the mech.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little complexity or movement (Applies to all McToran).</p>

<p>The Boxor:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Colors: Black and orange with small areas of silver, white and grey all work well together.</p>

<p>Complexity: Despite standing only as tall as a Toa Nuva set, this thing is fairly complicated and is fun to build throughout.</p>

<p>Functions: The mech&#39;s main function is to punch whenever pressure is applied on one of its feet. This works very well and is one of my favourite Bionicle functions. It has another function that allows for the cockpit area of the vehicle to open so Nuparu can be placed in or taken out.</p>

<p>Rubber bands: Uses better quality rubber bands, so the function doesn&#39;t wear out quickly (many of the 2001 Rahi had this issue).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Because the mech relies a lot on moving technic pieces, the arms are somewhat wobbly.</p>

<p>While these are necessary for the punching function, some may not like the open pins featured on the arms and legs.</p>

<p>If the cockpit area is opened by pulling up on the Bohrok head instead of pulling the McToran arm out of the way first, the arm could snap in two.</p>

<p>This is a must-have set that shows off the best of the technic aspects of early Bionicle while still being fun to build. 5/5&nbsp;</p>
