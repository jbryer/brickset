Another feature is the cannon and two hooks. The legs looks like great, with some systems. A good option, to put toa and make your own creation. One of the best of 02'.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vexorian","2009-12-25T12:37:12.887Z","Still my best bionicle set","This week I decided that with the new space I had available I finally was able to rebuild my old stuff. Yesterday I built the exo-toa and boy, it reminded me how great this set really is.

The build is very enjoyable. It was early bionicle days so it is mostly technic parts. The designers had to be very creative and get a giant bionicle set out of so many technic pieces and it worked.

It excels in functionality. There are 6 rubber bands hidden along the set. In one arm there is this extensively claw thing that automatically punches when you push it, I used to call it the Kanohi extractor. On the other arm we have the powerful launcher, in regards to bionicle launchers you won't get any better than this.  The chest opens by just pressing a 'button', this allows you to place the toa.

It is unfortunate that in those times the flexible piston legs were not around. The legs are really the exo-toa's weak point. They have no knees. Later titan sets can easily stand even in uneven terrain, this will jjust fall, in fact it is hard to place it even in flat areas, specially with a toa driving it, the extra weight makes it easy to fall. Besides of the lack of knees it is otherwise fairly articulate.

I think that there are only three toas that actually fit. The design is definitely Tahu-centric from seeing the orange bits in the color scheme. You'll need to mod either the exo or the toa if you wish to fit onua, pohatu, or any toa that is not a 'mata' toa. The exo-toa does have a head which allows it to look great even without any extra purchase (toa).


By that time, the silver parts were amazing, it is unfortunate that since then they became very frequent making it lose its shine a little. It is very tall. It is still my tallest non-MOC set though the only sets I own that are comparable in height are Teridax and Tuma.

Overall, if you happened to find it somewhere,call it obscure store or garage set, you should really buy it. I actually regret not getting two of them as they have a lot of useful parts.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Few, if any, Bionicle sets are built to exaggerate the abilities of a previous set. The Exo-Toa looks amazing with a Toa Mata placed inside (excluding Onua and Pohatu). The legs, though disappointingly immobile, are really well designed and the shoulders are brilliant. The shooting arm works wonderfully and the punching arm is very well designed. It is nice to reminisce over the older, more gear-centric Bionicles. Those are the ones that best describe the engineering genius that has gone into them.</li></ul><ul><li>The Exo-Toa looks imposing. It is tall, armored, and strong. When a Toa Mata is placed inside, they are immediately enhanced. This set is better for posing on a hard surface than any other alternative. Despite that, it is taller than Nidhiki, Krekka, Axonn, and Von Nebula, all of which were released much later.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>The legs do not move well at all. There is one exceedingly difficult joint at the top of each that seems to have been retired from later sets. The legs look fine, but are desperately lacking in playability. The feet guards function poorly and wobble around to the owner's displeasure.</li></ul><p>The Exo-Toa is a far different set than most others. If you see it for what it is rather than compare it to the superior titans and warriors of 2006 and forward, you will enjoy this set.</p><p><br></p><p>By Vakama<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4

"Nmfrey23","2023-01-07T21:05:52.99Z","Bionicle's biggest mech","<p>Of the two mechs that came out in 2002, I prefer the smaller Boxor to this set, the Exo Toa. However, I wouldn&#39;t call this set bad even in comparison. Sure, I do think that it has plentiful shortcomings and there were easy ways these could&#39;ve been fixed in 2002, but there are also so many creative features and enjoyable parts of the build that work very well here. Without further ado, this is what I think of the mixed bag that is the Exo Toa.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>The Build: Of the 378 parts used here, only 7 of them are standard ball and socket joint parts, so there&#39;s a lot of intricate Technic building going on here. It&#39;s a challenging yet rewarding build. It also looks great when completed, with the legs and heavily armoured torso making the mech look&nbsp;very robotic.</p>

<p>Functionality as a mech: This set can fit 5 of the 6&nbsp;Toa Mata or Nuva (excluding Pohatu and assuming the Toa Nuva are without armour) perfectly. The set incorporates a lot of really cool functions to make this possible. The torso can unfold and lock in place, the head can fold back using a crank operated system, and the thigh armour can fold out to become footrests for the Toa figure inside. This immediately can make any of these Toa figures look taller and a lot more imposing.</p>

<p>As of 2002, this was the largest humanoid set that Bionicle released. Even retrospectively, this set stands above many Titan and Warrior sets that came after it.</p>

<p>Other functions: This set features two other functions that aren&#39;t related to the mech aspect. Some frictionless pins and a rubber band allow for a punching function in the right arm, and the left arm has a LEGO System spring launcher attached to it. Both of these functions work very well and are fun additions to the set.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>This set&#39;s movement is extremely poor. The legs only feature one joint at the hip, and it&#39;s a Technic rotation joint instead of a ball joint. The arms only fare a little bit better. The right arm has a single ball joint at the shoulder which ends up being limited by the bulky shoulder armour, and the left arm features two joints. The left arm is still limited at the shoulder, but there&#39;s at least an elbow to aim the launcher.</p>

<p>Reliance on rubber bands: While I personally have no issue with the inclusion of rubber band functions in sets, there is an abundance of them in the Exo Toa, and, even with the improved rubber bands from 2002, a lot of the functions (the head and punching arm are the worst) put heavy strain on them which can lead to the bands snapping.</p>

<p>Stability: Even without a Toa&nbsp;figure inside, this set is very top-heavy. It often cannot stand without perfectly straight legs.</p>

<p>Though mostly hidden, some may not like the open axles or ball joints featured here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Exo Toa&nbsp;struggles in the movement and stability departments, it&#39;s still a ton of fun both during and after the&nbsp;building. The set&#39;s solid appearance, plethora of functions, and the ability to have other sets pilot it leads me to recommend it despite the flaws. 3/5</p>
