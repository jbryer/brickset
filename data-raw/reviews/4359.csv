"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-11T21:31:27Z","Great set!","This set is an incredible Technic set with a huge number of pieces. There is lots of variety in the pieces and they aren't too specialized. Even though the two creatures have nearly identical construction, the brilliance of their design overshadows any shortcomings. Too bad Bionicle took a turn for the worse--all their sets are smaller and have too many silver pieces now. I'll return to collecting Bionicle when and if they make sets like this again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-20T18:12:24.513Z","Great, bionicle or not","This is a super sized set. Not very super, but includes two great beast-like figures. Leaders of the bohrok swarms, Cahdok and Gahdok are very cool, they looks like similar, but you can see some changes, as in colors, or in itens, like the shields. The arms are short, but with long necks, they like very the bohrok. The head don't, because the teeth are great. This set looks like creator, technic(that made some bionicle), and of course, bionicle. The lego pieces are very compatible, being system, technic, and too duplo. Use the creativity to make creations. With this set, you can have a lot of pieces. Good, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The building for this set is a blast and is very fun. It takes long enough that it is enjoyable but it isn't so long that it is boring.

Playability:
Playability is also fantastic with this set as it reminds me of the original rahi sets in the way that there are two sets you can use to fight each other and to immobilise the other set.

Final:
If you see this set somewhere, I highly recommend that you purchase it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
