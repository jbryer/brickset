The street furniture and the cars on the other hand are much more interesting.

This is the only set to feature a genuine phonebooth and two roadside-telephones. Even though the latter objects are typically only to be found alongside highways, they all look very nice once you've dispersed them in your town.

The car-transporter is the only one in its kind and can neatly hold any sort of luxury lego-car.
because the assistance-car had to resemble a VW-golf (the car most commonly used by the ANWB) it is one of the first hatchbacks to be designed by lego. This really makes it stand out next to other cars of this era.

ANWB stands for: 'Algemene Nederlandse Wielrijders Bond'. Which roughly translates as: General Dutch Cyclists' association.
Originally founded to look after the interests of cyclists (putting up signposts, setting up a breakdown-assistance service and persuading the dutch government to create designated cycle-lanes on roads), it later on broadened its scope to all traffic-participants due to the growing popularity of the automobile and the increasing mobility of people in general.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
