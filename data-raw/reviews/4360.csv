P.S. This is not a set, just a stupid expansion pack.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-11-01T13:56:27.217Z","masks...","...and thats about it. They're still good ones because I remember getting a gold one and a silver one so ,because they were different colours of masks i had from bionicles i had, i put them on bionicles that i had brought. I remember this set came a leaflet that showed all the different masks and for brickset, i think tere were 7 different colours for each mask (ore 7 masks for each colour (or 6)).

It turned out I reviewed the wrong set before but I'm just writing the review for the right set now.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Dragon_Master_48","2012-05-25T22:30:24.52Z","The Bohrok Swarms Move Out...","<p>To go along with the Bohrok Swarms (which include the Standard Bohrok, the Bohrok-Va, and Bohrok-Kal), LEGO released <strong>8559</strong>&nbsp;for BIONICLE fans to expand their collections, or merely provide more variety among the Krana they already have.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>One Golden Kanohi, and one Silver Kanohi.</li><li>In the US, it was released in a box instead of a polybag. </li><li>Krana! The main focus of the set.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Could have included five Krana instead of three...</li><li></li></ul>
<p>This is a wonderful addition to the collection of any BIONICLE fan, although the selection might be a bit disappointing for those wanting a little bit more. If only LEGO still produced these...</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,3,4

They were awesome back then, and there still awesome now, and I plan to get another one someday, to relive the memories.
