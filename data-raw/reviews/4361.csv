The 856 was one of those sets that, when you're building it for the first time, you're not too sure what you'll end up with (the functions were not immediately obvious to me until the set was nearly complete).  Once built, it has a solid, compact feel to it.  It looks realistic, especially with the wide treads, and is scaled well.  Having this set means you get to build all kinds of things with treads.  I once built a half-track military truck with a two-cylinder engine using the 856 and 8859 (with the 8848's wheels in the front).  It might have looked better if Lego had put out green Technic pieces back then.  Anyway, should you find an 856 somewhere, grab it and growl.  10/10.   1 May 2004",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-05-15T06:14:12.467Z","its great, yellow and fun to build","Did i mention i love yellow sets? The yellow castle is my thing, and everything else in my lego city could be yellow also. Well, this Dozer is yellow, got those chains for moving (how does one call them in english) and it has a quite good amount of technique inside which you cant see from the outside. Its really fun to build. I can remember, it was not more produced when i was a kid at some point and i got other sets from the technic themewhich i also loved a lot, but now, adult, grown up, old man, i own two of this - wonderful design, great playability, nice alternative models coming with the instructions and dont forget the whole bulk of bricks you get to make other technic gems with. Sure, this would have been my fav set back in my childish days, today it ranks at some high level at my technic-theme-toplist. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"superjohn","2009-04-13T08:08:44.937Z","Brilliant - if only the tracks weren't so delicate!","I got this around 1980 when I was 11 or so.  It cost Â£12.95 from Debenhams.  I remember being totally thrilled.  It was a really tricky build.

Yesterday we found it in the loft and my 8 year old son built it in about 2 hours.  The first thing we noticed is how the instructions require more skill than those in modern sets.  There are several parts added in each stage and you have to check the pictures carefully.

But he managed it with a little help from me, and now I can see again what a great model it is.  The bucket mechanism is fantastic, with full raise/lower and tilt.

Criticisms:

1) The tracks are easily broken when removing them, the little plastic hooks are too thin really.  Luckily there were several spare links in the set.

2) The bucket tilt mechanism uses a push-fit connection to the rack, which is operated in tension, so it tends to pull apart when you tip the bucket.  This is a little annoying.

3) The bucket tends to fall down on its own.

4) The exhaust pipe constantly falls off!

But hey, this is a classic set and we're really enjoying playing with it again.

Now we need to figure out how to add power functions.

After my dark age this is one of the first models I rebuild with collected parts I'd bought off E-bay.

This still rates as one of my favourite sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TechnicNick","2011-06-02T16:12:41.807Z","Good Looking and Great Building","As a nine year old, I was inordinately proud of having completed this; it is an impressive looking little machine that demonstrated very skillful use of just gears, racks and levers to work it's functions. It always seemed a little over-complicated for what it did and this is borne out by the smaller, newer 8828 doing the same (plus steering) with far fewer parts.<div><br></div><div>Still, for the time this was a handsome thing, with it's levers, tracks and yellowness transporting you straight to the quarry (oh alright, back garden..) to shift dirt until it's bucket fell off. Happy days.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"FlagsNZ","2014-08-25T07:04:58.597Z","This is a great yellow digger","<p>It is amazing how simple yet effective the early Technic sets really were. This little yellow digger exemplifies how intelligent design can make a simple build very effective.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This model relies&nbsp;on some brick built linear actuators and several push pull linkages to give the bucket it&#39;s function. There are two rubber&nbsp;bands&nbsp;which springs everything back and stops the bucket from inadvertently tipping.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3861/14841321057_b7d6e084cf.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3873"">tracks</a> are great and are still found in Lego sets in 2014.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The finished model is very strong however the <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/3651"">Technic axle&nbsp;pin connectors</a>&nbsp;tend to slip off the bucket when stressed.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>After completing this build, I was impressed with how simple and effective the bucket functions are. &nbsp;I have been driving this digger around my old denim&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/787-1/Storage-Cloth"">Lego mat</a> scooping up miscellaneous&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<p>There are a few parts missing from this set, but replacements are on order.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For people waiting to buy the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42030-1/Volvo-L350F-Wheel-Loader"">42030 Volvo Front Wheel Loader</a>, this is where Lego&#39;s civil engineering yellow diggers all started.</p>

<p>Simple yet effective.</p>
