"Gus_263","2008-02-20T14:37:41.797Z","Pahrak the brown bohrok","One of the brown sets. With classic colors like the same of pohatu, very rare in bionicle. I don't know why, but i hope that this color bring back in someday. The color is very notable in the kaita, and the green colors in the krana are awesome. The krana's shape is assorted. The krana can be putted in any toa nuva. The shields are awesome, as in the sphere form or no.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-09-07T14:38:56.577Z","Pahrak: The Bohrok of Stone","I got this a couple of days ago and it is really good. It can fold up into a ball and its head can jut forward. It can also be rebuilt into a Waikiru (Instructions on Lego Club Website).
 Onto the pros and cons:

Pros:
Head can jut forward
Can fold up into a ball
Random Green Krana included
Good Colour Scheme
Stands up well
Cool Stone Sheilds

Cons:
Small limbs
Its head can't turn round.

Overall, a good set, 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-30T20:04:08.687Z","One of the best Bionicles!","I always loved this set, and still due. The fact it can roll into a ball, not to mention it can &quot;hibernate&quot; in it's case all adds to the cool factor. His arms and very neat looking, and like his legs, flexible, yet not TOO flexible, which is good. You can make his head thrust foward to attack enemies, which is a great feature. Sometimes his Krana falls out when you do that though, which isn't that great. 

Speaking of Krana, they come in many shapes and colors, and I got a nice green one with this set. If you hit one of his &quot;eyes&quot; they fly out, weakening him greatly. A great feature, though it sometimes comes out when you don't want it to.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 41 pieces and it was 8 USD when it came out 
which means that is 20 cents per piece which is really good for what we
 get here.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 arms, the hands, the legs and the feet can be moved. The head can be 
opened if you want to change the krana and on the back is a lever which 
allows you to push the head forwards and/or backwards. This figure can be folded if you want to put him back into the canster as well. It's a great figure and I also think that this is a 
great army builder as well.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T16:47:01.443Z","Bohrok Swarm","<p>Set #8560 Pahrak: Much like the Toa the Bohrok all had identical body builds. Unlike the Toa however the Bohrok had a much better thought out gimmick in my opinion because it didn't hinder your ability to play and pose your Bohrok figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pahrak's brown coloring is nicely complimented with light beige limbs and transparent green fangs? Tusks perhaps? The lunging gimmick of the Bohrok were a real treat and you could just use it for hours without getting bored. As with all older Bionicle sets the Bohrok cut corners when it comes to hands, these models use a single unique piece to represent both hands as weapons with the actual hands just being simple connector pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the Bohrok are deserving of joining anyone's Bionicle collection. Their cannisters were also a lot better for storage and display due to the ability to clip the Bohrok onto the inside of their lids and have them hanging inside of the cannisters in a sort of stasis mode. Also being quite compact when in stasis mode they can roll, though I'm not sure how well that is. If you haven't already acquired the Bohrok then they should be on your wants list if you've had an interest in them.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"tkettle9719","2011-12-17T08:40:52.993Z","An enemy for Onua...","<p>The whole Bionicle theme was getting on to me, and thus I had no other choice but to get this set and discover more functions of this little beast.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The color scheme blends well; while being a bit too common, it still looks really good, as though the designer wanted it to attach to a tree's likeness. <br></li><li>-The head launch function is already addictive to children, but combining it with the rubber head mask replacement function is even funner. It can even roll into a ball just because it's that epic.&nbsp; <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-These Bohrok have 10 more pieces, and seem significantly smaller than the Toa. How?<br></li><li>-This is minor, but I would have like to see maybe a bit of body rather than a giant head.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this set helps to further define childhood for me, and it does make me glad that this line was so successful that Lego could take the Technic brand off of this series. This set really just works nearly perfectly. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Annoying to build</li></ul>
<p>Mine came with a GREEN Krana, is that normal? Lime green, not Pahrak green. Anyway if you are an insect fan you should seriously buy this cute critter and other Bohrok too!</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,4
