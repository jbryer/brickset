"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-24T01:00:51.793Z","A Grand Continuation in the BIONICLE Series","The Bohrok Saga is one of my favorite sagas in the Bionicle series, and I must say, the Bohrok sets are impressive indeed. 

The canistar for this set is very interesting, at least it was when I got it (the Bohrok/Krana thing wasn't explained, so I had no idea what they were). The front displays the can art which is no doubt impressive. It contains an image of Nuhvok striking a battle pose, with ominous silhouettes of more Bohrok in the background. On the back, the fold up function is displayed (more on that later) and we see an image of the Bohrok Krana being placed on a Toa Nuva's (or original Toa's, I'm basing this off the Kal canisters and assuming they are the same. All normal Bohrok canisters are in a shed) head. 

The set has a simple build. The main features of this set are: the bucking forward of the head via a clever gear system. This is also a battle mechanism. You buck forward until you hit the eye of the opposing Bohrok. This will push the eye down and back, lifting up a plate that holds the Krana, which will then break open (not literally) the top plate and send the Krana flying. Nifty. There is also the Krana itself, a soft rubbery/foam mask that comes in eight shapes and six cool and different colors. The last feature is the folding feature. It is actually quite hard to do the first few times, but then will eventually become like clockwork to you. Pun not intended.

For playability, this guy has all his bases covered. He is a cool villain for your Toa to fight, and his roll up ability allows you to play bowling like games. You know you've done it!

Overall, while most people would disagree, I think this set is great. It's fun to play with and looks quite decent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It does not have any weapons, which might make it look cooler!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-20T14:44:55.437Z","Black bohrok","One of the most coolest bohrok, it's shields are great, combinating with the others to make a kaita it can be useful. The legs and arms have more light colors, like the first black bionicle. The shift possibility is a option of fun. The krana and gear system are awesome.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-31T18:13:38.86Z","mmmm?","I think that I'll only review this one since they are pretty much the same set with different colors. The Bohrok are actually pretty cool. You can form them into little balls. And, you can press a little lever that propels their head forward. Mask also flies out if you hit the eyes. This one is probably my favorite because of the color scheme.  I think I got this set on sale too along with the others (what a surprise). Over all 8 out of 10 because there is no creativity between the sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-22T08:01:01.763Z","My Favorite Bohrok","I got this, again, by trading/buying Bionicles from my friend.  I got this one from him for five bucks.  He didn't have one of his eyes, but I found one the right color in the Lego box.
Okay, this set, as I stated above, is my favorite Bohrok (Kohrak comes dangerously close, though).  I like the all-black, spooky color scheme with the &quot;glowing&quot; green eyes.  It gave me the creeps right away, and that's why I wanted him.  So what are the ups and downs to this set?

Pros:

I LUV HIS POWER (storyline speaking)!!

Spooky color scheme

Wicked green eyes

Can roll up into a ball; go outside and play Catch the Bohrok with your dad! :D

Krana ejects

&quot;Posability&quot;

Overall mighty and dangerous look

Cons:

The white &quot;nose&quot; pieces kinda mess up the scheme, but that's only if you look explicitly at the aesthetics of the set.

Go get him!!  You won't regret it!!  You can get him on eBay or Bricklink easy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The only differences between them are their ""claws"" and color of their skin.  They do have some cool things to do like curl into a ball and head-butt their enemies.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

 arms, the hands, the legs and the feet can be adjusted. On the back is a lever which allows you to push the head of this figure forwards and/or backwards and you can also open the top if you want to change the krana. This figure can 
be folded if you want to put him back into the canster as well. It's a 
great figure and I also think that this is a 
great army builder as well.<br></span></p>

"Vanloki","2009-12-16T21:49:14.78Z","The Roly-Poly swarms!!","Man, I love this set. Being small and able to curl up into a ball, (Like a roly-poly!! =O) It can fit in my pocket, and I can take it anywhere. Having tons of nice pieces, an awesome build, and that ever-so tempting collectible Krana, These are the positive aspects of this set.
But no set is perfect...

The main problem with this set, and the other chain sets is the repetition....  They are all mostly differently colored versions of the same module, and the only distinguiting quality about them is their different weaponry and color schemes.

Overall, here are teh Pros. and Cons. =3

 Pros. 
-Fun Build + Design
-Great playability
-Green and black color scheme
-Krana!

Cons.
-Repetition
-Head gears loose

That about wraps it up for Nuhvok, all in all, I would highly reccomend this set for a gift, or just for Play.

That's Nuhvok! =^W^=",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T17:00:16.3Z","Bohrok Lunge","<p>Set #8561 Nuhvok: After a while all of these models start blending together and it does become difficult to find something unique to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nuhvok is pitted against Onua color wise and the two standing against one another were always quite impressive on my shelf. I especially liked the weapons Nuhvok used. They might almost be some sort of liquid dispensing tools that could launch streams of acid or liquid metal at his enemies. Or just jab them hard and hold them in place so he could KO them with his launching head gimmick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bohrok are all worthy of being owned, as a set they complement the original Toa quite nicely and you could find some interesting ways to display and play with them when you got really creative. For MOCers all of them have wonderful pieces to be used and the Krana are an interesting set of pieces with curious looking designs. If you've been debating against these or their Bohrok Val counterparts... Get both and treat yourself to some real fun. :D</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"flarefish","2014-11-27T08:17:21.637Z","head butting robot.","<p>The Bohrok&nbsp;Nuhvok is just like all the others that is why I am not doing a review of all the bohrok&nbsp;and for me this is the coolest.&nbsp;This is because he has a very nice colour&nbsp;scheme and has really cool weapons that look like graspers of some kind. All the bohrok have the ability to open up there head to reveal&nbsp;a krana(&nbsp;a krana is a sort of brain to the bohrok.)&nbsp;By pushing down the button on the back of the bohrok it will fire the krana.&nbsp;Krana also fit on to toa heads without the mask. If you push the button without the head open it will act as if it is head butting, the head butt is powerful enough to knock most other bionicle sets over.</p>

<p>Nuhvok&nbsp;has a very nice colour scheme of green and black and has a hand like gun weapon.</p>

<p>The bohrok are just clones and for some reason I bought them&nbsp;all. It is worth buying them all because of their combo models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Epic combo model.</p>

<p>Really good colour schemes on every bohrok.</p>

<p>Krana fits on to toa heads.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>All bohrok are basicly clones of each other.</p>

<p>Umm their a bit fat ,sorry bohrok.</p>

<p>They are hard to stand up looking up or down because they are so fat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My rating out of ten for the bohroks&nbsp;is six and&nbsp;3/4 out of ten</p>
