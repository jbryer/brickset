"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-07T20:56:14.34Z","What?!","-the pose is not that great, and is it swimming or running? The orange on the bohrok stands out-in a good way. 
What lego needs is weapons, and again, bionicle can not survive without a weapon. But other than that, it is very good!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-18T16:28:39.56Z","Good in all","Looks like very all bohrok and bohrok-kal. but like i say on my other reviews it can be a helpful thing for combinations, like the old kaitas. The blue is awesome, with a light color and orange eyes, teeth well designed, gear system, and shield, it have also a krana. If you have this set, search for assortment of krana. Overall: it is so cool, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T13:17:22.123Z","He Controls Wata!","Gahlok is my fourth Bohrok in my collection (I also have Gahlok-Kal).  One thing I like is his color scheme (all Bohrok have good ones!).  It matches the FL Gators (LOL)!!  Sorry, had to let off some steam.  Okay, other than the color scheme, this guy can shoot his head forward (like all the Bohrok and Bohrok-Kal) and can curl up into a ball (again, like all the others).  And, as my title suggests, he controls water (somewhat).  Altogether another fiver.  Here's the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

-Can curl into a ball

-Can hang upside-down inside canister, but I lost mine :(

-Can hurl his Krana

-Head shoots forward with the press of a lever

-COLOR SCHEME MATCHES FL GATORS!! :D

Cons:

-None!!

Go Gahlok!!  This set is well worth your money, so go get it!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Commander_Bly","2009-04-06T17:36:23.857Z","Cool, small Bionicle set","This is a neat little Bionicle set that I got a couple months ago. He is really neat because of his color, and because of his head that can spring forward. Here are the PROs and CONs.

PROs:
Awesome head that can spring forward
Easy but interesting build
Awesome eyes and fangs
Can roll up into ball

CONs:
Needs an additional weapon

Overall, I would rate this set 4/5. This is a fun, nifty Bionicle set that anyone can enjoy (as long as there is someone for him to fight against!)!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T00:13:28.75Z","Pretty awesome though he is small.","Gahlok is pretty awesome. If you press a certain button, his head shoots up and can knock down a lot of stuff. There isn't much to say else about him, but I think that all bionicle collecters should have at least one of these king of guys.",FALSE,3,3,4,3,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-25T11:26:33.12Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Bohrok) - Gahlok Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 41 pieces and it was 8 USD when it came out. 
That means that is 20 cents per piece which is a good value for what we get here.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8562-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></span></p><p><br><span>The
 arms, the hands, the legs and the feet can be moved. On the back you
 can see a lever which allows you to push the head of this figure 
forwards and backwards. You can also change
 the rubbery krana if you open the top of the head. What I think is interesting about the 
bohrok sets is that they can be folded if you want to put them back into
 the canister. It's a cool figure and I also think that this is a 
great army builder as well.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T17:07:13.127Z","Bohrok Swim","<p>Set #8562 Gahlok: Armies of Gahlok swimming through the oceans hunting Gali, that picture speaks quite well for this set. I'd almost have to say that having more than one Bohrok was LEGO's true intention, perhaps that is why these sets were priced the way they were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gahlok is of course blue, so that... hmmm I wonder if Gahlok was also female? Well he or she could attack Gali and compliment the Toa quite nicely. If you preferred not to use the mythos of Bionicle and just wanted to do your own thing you could take Gali, Gahlok and Rahkshi Guurahk and have them all standing together to form a Team Blue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Bohrok came with the same pieces, only their weapons/hands and Krana were different. Unusually different in some cases, if I remember right a few of the Krana weren't even color coded to match their respective Bohrok's basic skin tone. Instead of being blue or green you'd get beige or purple, truly an unusual design choice on LEGO's part. Still Gahlok is a worthy addition to any Bionicle collection, so if you're lucky enough to find... Him/Her then pick him/her up and start having some fun now.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
