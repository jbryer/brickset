The teeth are the same of bohroks, the shields have flame designs, and the legs and arms colors are the same orange of tahu. Great features, the gear system to move the head, capability to shift in sphere, the krana covered, the head pieces, and the little feet.

"legoguy2805","2008-05-17T11:31:27.827Z","Bohrok of Fire","My neighbour got me this for 5p (5p!) at a car boot sale. Anyway,
This set is one of the most playable I have ever seen. It can roll up into a ball, which you can attach to the inside of its canister and when you push its eyes down its Krana flips out. Also, when you push a lever at the back, its head jutts forward.

Pros:
Lots of different functions
Good colour scheme
Stands up well
Random Blue Krana which you can also attach to a 2001 Toa/Matoran head(I got a Krana Vu, Krana of Flight)
Fire Sheilds

Cons:
None!

Overall, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

On the back you can see a lever which allows you to push the head of this figure forwards and backwards. You can also open the head if you want to change the krana which is rubbery. What I think is interesting about the bohrok sets is that they can be folded if you want to put them back into the canister. It's a very nice figure and I also think that this is a great army builder as well.<br></span></p>

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T17:15:38.107Z","Bohrok Armies","<p>Set #8563 Tahnok: I feel that I am repeating myself in some sort of endless loop, but it can't be helped, that is the basic problem with Bionicle. Each group of six tended to blend together until you weren't sure who was what or where and why they were all ganging up together to start fighting against these Toa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bionicle Mythos is what really intrigued collectors of this fine Technic sub-line. Unlike Throwbots before them Bionicle figures were something that had real staying power, as evidenced by how long they were the forerunners of LEGO's Technic Theme. I saw more Bionicle than any of the ordinary Technic sets on the shelves at any retail outlet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tahnok's red coloring means he is an adversary of Tahu, or at least that's what you would have done if you wanted each Toa to face their respective colored Bohrok counterparts. In practicality it would have made more sense for Gali to fight Tahnok, Kopaka to fight Gahlok, Tahu to fight Lehvak and... well you get the idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're a big fan of Bionicle chances are you already own pretty much everything and bought each group as soon as they came out. I know it's what I would have tried to do if I hadn't lost track of everything or didn't have other collections that also interested me. But if you're just starting out in the Bionicle field, then I say you can't go wrong with a few Bohrok in your collection. The stocky little vicious creatures are a deadly group of enemies that any Toa group is sure to face eventually.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"tkettle9719","2011-12-17T08:52:16.023Z","Another Bohrok for Makuta's Army","<p>The Bohrok may look very similar to each other, but I find this particular set to be at a higher standard than Pahrak. Now, to my list...<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-This set does the nice red-black-orange color scheme, something all fire Bionicle should have.<br></li><li>-Functions. The ball and head launch are super fun, adding enormously to play value. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-I like irony, but I find the blue eyes to be just a tad ironic, especially when compared to other fire Bionicle.<br></li><li>-This set also feels small compared to my Onua. Good thing there's two. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Sure, Bionicle sets from the same series look very similar, but it's the differences that make these similar sets cool, like color or weapons. And that's what this set does well. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2016-09-12T19:44:23.173Z","Clean it with Fire ;)","<p>In Bionicle&#39;s first year, the Toa were pitted against the Rahi, the wildlife of the world which had been terrorizing the Matoran villagers for centuries due to Makuta infecting their masks. The Rahi sets were impressive Technic constructions, but they had a bit of a downside as far as collecting went: Their price. While the Toa were less than $10, this was not the case for their adversaries. The smallest set, 8537 Nui-Rama, was a modest $15 but the larger sets were priced at $35, $50, $70, and $100 (That one was two remote-controlled motorized beasts, admittedly). Deservedly or not, this wound up negatively impacting the sales. So the following year, 2002, Lego employed a new strategy:</p>

<p>They cut back the larger sets to two, one $35 and one $60, and released a main line of smaller enemies at the same price point as (and with a similar design philosophy to) the Toa. These were the Bohrok, a swarm of beetle-like beasts (that were in effect demi-autonomous mechs for parasitic creatures called Krana) of a mysterious origin, awakened prematurely by Makuta to cause problems for the Toa while he licked his wounds from the showdown at the end of the 2001 storyline. They were numerous (handily encouraging army-building), they had powers as the Toa did, and they had a singular mission: to &quot;clean&quot; the Island of Mata Nui. By this they meant destroying the Matoran villages and the very environments of the island until it was returned to how it was in the Time Before Time, before Mata Nui transformed it to give the Matoran a temporary home. The Krana that drove the Bohrok could also take control of Matoran, Turaga, and even Toa by latching onto their unmasked faces. With that story to grab interest and their budget-friendly price, the Bohrok proved very popular and sold well.</p>

<p>There were six varieties:</p>

<p>Kohrak, Bohrok of Ice,<br />
Nuhvok, Bohrok of Earth<br />
Lehvak, Bohrok of Acid<br />
Gahlok, Bohrok of Water<br />
Pahrak, Bohrok of Drought<br />
Tahnok, Bohrok of Fire and subject of this review.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all Bohrok, Tahnok comes in a canister (the Bohroks&#39; are intended to represent the individual cells that make up the combs of the Bohrok Nest). The lid is metallic sand red in Tahnok&#39;s case, and has a hollow post in the bottom where a matching clip (that I&#39;ll get more into later) can be attached. The canister itself is see-through, with a decal on one side that serves the same function as the front of a box</p>

<p>The instructions are bent along the curve of the canister&#39;s side, or at least were packaged that way.&nbsp; They contain the steps for building Tahnok and the middle third of the instructions for building Bohrok Kaita Za (Nuhvok + Tahnok + Pahrak). They show 3D renders of the parts against a background depicting the nest, are printed clearly, and do not suffer from ambiguous angles nor tell you to attach any parts before you really should. At the end there are some extra pages showing scenes from the storyline, and a cross-sell showing all six Bohrok and their assorted Krana.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many of Tahnok&#39;s parts were newly created for the Bohrok. These are: the black Technic beams that form the base of the head, the torso halves (Tahnok&#39;s are red), the small white fang/mandible pieces, the cover plate for the head (which is transparent with in Tahnok&#39;s case red paint or possibly blended plastic at the front that streaks toward the back), the clawlike shields that attach to the ends of their arms - Tahnok&#39;s have flames in the middle, naturally, the Krana tray, the long Technic fangs that are here used as eyes (Tahnok&#39;s are blue), the beam-connected gears, the gear with a push-tab, the feet, the limbs, the Krana (which is made of rubber - caution children against putting it in their mouth because the moisture can make it swell and warp so that it doesn&#39;t fit, comes in a color that matches the Bohrok&#39;s eyes, and is randomly selected from eight designs), and a clip the same color as the canister lid that can be used to hang the assembled Bohrok from the lid.</p>

<p>There are also of course existing parts, these being the Technic horseshoe joints, the Technic axles, the Technic ball-pins, the long Technic pin w/o friction ridges that&#39;s used to hold the head cover, and the high-quality neoprene green rubber band.</p>

<p>All serve their intended purpose well, and can readily be put to other uses.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Tahnok:</p>

<p>The build is quick, as one would expect from a small set. It starts with inserting axles into one torso half, mounting the gears, and then buttoning things up with the other half. The head starts the same way. Then the eyes, Krana tray, mandibles, and faceplate are added. The limbs come last.</p>

<p>Bohrok Kaita Za (middle third):</p>

<p>This starts with building Nuhvok&#39;s head and body mostly as normal, but with the addition of Tahnok&#39;s faceplate hanging down from between the torso halves. Then two of Tahnok&#39;s limbs (with a horseshoe joint on either end) are mounted to the lower axle socket of Nuhvok&#39;s torso.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Tahnok is symmetrical, insectile in appearance, and has a menacing-looking aggressive countenance. It is red and orange, with blue eyes and krana for a bit of color contrast. Pressing the tab at the back makes its head lunge forward to ram the masks off of Toa and Matoran. A good hit on the eye will make the Krana tray flip up, knocking the faceplate open and sending the Krana spilling out. Tahnok is also designed to be folded up into a &quot;ball&quot; form, in which it can be suspended from the canister lid to represent hibernation. It can also use this form to travel more quickly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Tahnok is a suitably menacing-looking opponent for early Toa figures, functions well, and is affordable. While unlike the Toa the Bohrok are completely identical aside from their shields and colors, they&#39;re still fun to collect. Tahnok is worth getting if you don&#39;t already have one - or if you do. There were hundreds, after all.</p>
