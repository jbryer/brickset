"Gus_263","2008-02-20T14:31:01.467Z","Powerful bohrok swarm","A great set with shields that looks like more claws. The kaita is very cool, with three bohroks and a good color scheme. The instructions combination is one of the some features. Another are the krana, gear systems that moves the head, and a capability of shift in sphere. This bohrok of acid is awesome!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-17T15:42:43.64Z","Lehvak, Bohrok of Acid","I got this off Bricklink with Pohatu Mata. Like all Bohrok, Lehvak is extremely playable. You get a random Red Krana. (I got a Xa.)
You can combine it with a Tahnok to make a Keras or combine it with a Gahlok to make a Ghekula (Instructions on Lego Club website) or you can combine it with a Gahlok and a Kohrak to make a Bohrok Kaita Ja. (Instructions in Instruction Booklets)

Lehvak are the Bohrok of Acid. They can fire acid with their Acid Sheilds. Like all Bohrok, they are completely mechanical and are controlled by Krana. Their purpose is to destroy everything on Mata Nui. They live in the Bohrok nest with all the Bohrok and Bohrok Va. They were awakened by Teridax after his battle with the Toa Mata. They went back to sleep after the Toa Mata caged the Bahrag. They were awoken again by the Toa Nuva to clean Mata Nui, for it was one of the steps to awakening Mata Nui. They cleaned the island, fought with Kardas, then went back to sleep when the job was done.

Pros:
Head jutts forward
Can fold into a ball
I never noticed this before, but when you press down on its eyes the Krana flings out
Random Red Krana
Acid Sheilds
Good Colour Scheme
Stands up well

Cons:
None!

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T13:11:05.53Z","Great Color Scheme!!","I love the color scheme!  The red eyes and Krana really makes the green Bohrok look neat!  He was actually the third Bionicle I've ever got.  He's one of my favorite, too.  I just love all the Bohrok.  They may look alike, but they're very different in their way (see my review on Kohrak, Nuhvok, Gahlok, and Gahlok-Kal).  You may think the arms and legs are too small, but if they were bigger, he couldn't curl up into a ball.  Altogether he's a fiver.  Stats are as follows:

Pros:

-Can curl into a ball

-COLOR SCHEME!!

-He can chuck his Krana

-His head shoots forward when you press on the lever on his back

-Gear system for head

Cons:

-None!!

Go get Lehvak!  In fact, go get all the Bohrok!!  You won't be disappointed!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-23T17:22:48.313Z","Bohrok Strike","<p>Set #8564 Lehvak: The last of the Bohrok finally... Not that that's a bad thing, but there's only so much you can say in one of these reviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehvak is green, his unique looking weapons are dangerous looking claws for grasping and damaging the Toa. Except of course they are single molded pieces that don't open and close, but oh well. Much like the other six Lehvak also has a lunging head pounding gimmick that never fails to impress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another fact I may have failed to mention yet is that much like the Toa all six Bohrok can be combined into two different gestalts, another reason perhaps to buy multiple versions of each one if you're the type of person who displays them in both models forms. Ironically enough I have never seen these gestalt forms in person, since I never bothered to even pretend to build those models, they just didn't interest me as much as the individual models did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're on the fence about the Bohrok don't be. All six of them are quite fun and look great next to any larger Bionicle models on display. I can't recommend them enough, which may contradict what I said in my original reviews of the three models I kept, but in all honesty had I the space and display room for them I never would have sold them. As it stands with one of each I just feel that I can do without owning all six of them.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"CaptainBrick33","2022-01-01T19:44:40.557Z","Cleaning it all since 2002!","<p><em>&quot;Clean it all. It must be cleaned!&quot;</em></p>

<p>With the Bohrok sets reaching their 20th anniversary this year, I thought that it might be a nice opportunity to review one of them - Lehvak. This is also a review of the Bohrok line as a whole, as they are all identical except for their elemental shields and their colours.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>One of the more unique aspects of the BIONICLE line was the packaging. Instead of being sold in cardboard boxes, the Bohrok come in plastic canisters. On the front of the canister, there is an action shot of Lehvak, possibly attacking a Toa, and on the back there are all the set&#39;s features shown, as well as the very nostalgic&nbsp;<em>Just imagine...&nbsp;</em>text. There is a play feature involving the canister&#39;s lid, but I&#39;ll cover it in the playability section.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>Because Lehvak has only 41 parts, the building experience is very simple. And since all the Bohrok are identical, it can get a bit repetitive after building basically&nbsp;the same model twelve times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are pretty standard, though there are also instructions for a Bohrok Kaita Ja combination model, and there is some info about the 2002 story of BIONICLE.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>At the time of release, almost all of Lehvak&#39;s parts were completely new to Lego. The only parts returning from past sets are the black technic sockets and the most basic black technic axles. However, after 20 years, the only parts that are still exclusive to this set are the lime Bohrok limbs (don&#39;t worry, these don&#39;t break), green Bohrok feet and the green/transparent clear faceplate.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Because this set doesn&#39;t include any minifigures, let&#39;s get straight into the Bohrok Lehvak model.</p>

<p>Story wise, Lehvak is one of many Bohrok&nbsp;who were under command of the Bahrag Queens. Their goal was simple - to clean it all. Unlike other Bohrok, the Lehvak are equipped with claw-like shields, which unfortunately can&#39;t open and close like actual claws. The Bohrok sets have a minimal range of articulation: arms, hands, feet and hips. This was at the time when BIONICLE sets still lacked elbow, knee and head movement. Lehvak in particular has a very vibrant colour scheme of lime and, as some people call it, Mata green. He also has some black sockets and aggressive red eyes, which do a good job contrasting against the green. That&#39;s pretty much it regarding the build, but where this set really shines is in the playability.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>To be honest, this set&#39;s play features are the best thing about it. Firstly, by pushing a button in Lehvak&#39;s back, its head will snap forward to attack. A green rubber band then retracts the head. You can also launch a Krana from the head by either pushing the button when the faceplate is open, or by pushing on one of the eyes. Every Bohrok set comes with a random Krana in the colour of the Bohrok&#39;s eyes, and my Lehvak comes with a bright red Krana Yo.&nbsp; Lehvak can also fold into a sphere, which can be used to go bowling, or to store your Bohrok in the canister. Every Bohrok and Bohrok-Kal set comes with a connector which can be used to attach the Bohrok of your choice to the lid of the canister, which represents the Bohrok sleeping when it&#39;s not needed above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, as I mentioned above, Lehvak can be combined with&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-4"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8562-1/Gahlok"">8562</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-5"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8565-1/Kohrak"">8565</a>&nbsp;to build the Bohrok Kaita Ja combo. He can also be combined with&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-6"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8563-1/Tahnok"">8563</a>&nbsp;to create a&nbsp;Keras, and with&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-7"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8562-1/Gahlok"">8562</a>&nbsp;again to create a Ghekula.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Should you buy this set? Let&#39;s recap:</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>An incredible amount of new or unique parts</li>
	<li>Tons of play features</li>
	<li>Collectability aspect with the Krana</li>
	<li>Vibrant colours, which are not very common in later BIONICLE sets</li>
	<li>Very massable</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Practically a clone of the other Bohrok</li>
	<li>Limited poseability</li>
</ul>

<p>If you couldn&#39;t tell already, the Bohrok are great sets both for older and younger Lego fans alike. Lehvak has vibrant, eye-catching colours and an amazing amount of functions. However, the biggest downside of this set, which isn&#39;t even its fault, is the price. Because the Bohrok are 20 years old, good luck getting them for cheap in new condition. Still, I would highly recommend Lehvak and the Bohrok sets in general, and they are great army building sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And remember,&nbsp;<em>if you wake one... <b>you wake them all...</b></em></p>
