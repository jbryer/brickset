While smaller than any toa ever made, they were very fun to play with, mainly due to the head snapping action feature, which, while limiting movement, was incredibly fun to play with.  

Kohrak is the only one that I actually own, and the colours are good. The krana doesnâ€™t look out of place like some of the others, and you really do get the sense that this is one cool customer. I got this one on sale back in 03, and I have never regretted it. 4 stars, though, because of the small size. Check out my profile!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-02T13:00:10.623Z","Ball of Ice","This was my first Bionicle ever.  I got him after my friend got Kopaka.  He's a nice set, and very playable.  The buzz saws are really neat looking, and they help to give him a spherical shape.  Of course, like any other Bohrok, he can roll up into a ball.  The Krana can be launched by pressing down on the eyes to release the &quot;hood&quot; and pressing the lever hard.  The light blue eyes compliment the set nicely.  The arms and legs may seem a little short, but if they were longer, you couldn't roll him into a ball.

Pros:

-Can roll into a ball

-Color scheme

-Launching Krana

-Buzz saws

Cons:

-Kind of a clone of the other Bohrok

This is a good addition to any Bionicle collection.  I highly recommend Kohrak.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T17:13:15.723Z","Bohrok Rise","<p>Set #8565 Kohrak: I was quite impressed by the Bionicle LEGO sets when they were first introduced, but not because of the mythos behind the characters, I was impressed because they were all very interesting looking LEGO figures built with Technic pieces that gave off a vibe of Robots or Mecha. And I am a fan of both those genres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I began to purchase Bionicle, I picked up all six Toa, all six Bohrok, three Toa Nuva and all six Rahkshi, but as time went on I began to realize that I was holding on to a few too many themes. I chose to limit my purchases and I chose to weed out older material that no longer suited my storage capacities. Sadly this meant that many of my Bionicles were destined for a new home with (hopefully) fans or children who would enjoy them as they were meant to be enjoyed with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said I figured I would keep the Bionicle Stars to represent my interest in Bionicle, that plus the Mini-Figure scaled sets. But it would seem that fate had other plans in mind. Thus Kohrak remained unsold and unwanted, so I chose to keep him along with Kopaka Nuva and Rahkshi Kurrahk. (Probably misspelled that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review. All of the Bohrok sets were built basically identically, the only thing which changed was the coloring of the parts and the coloring of the... Oh dear I've forgotten what they are called, I want to say Kranna? The little mask things that were the source of their power, according to the mythos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gimmick of the Bohrok was&nbsp;elastic band&nbsp;activated lunging features, basically you pulled down on a lever and the head would shoot forward to strike at and knock down the Toa or Toa Nuva being attacked. Or it could launch the Kranna(?) and then you could pretend that the Toa were being possessed by the evil little creatures. Basically the Bohrok represented the Bionicle equivalent of parasites. So they were pretty cool and icky in that respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still find the set to be rather fun to build and fiddle with, using technic pieces you can do pretty much anything you want to Kohrak and if you have all six Bohrok you can merge them together into two much larger creatures. (I never indulged in that aspect of the figure, the larger gestalts always seemed to look as though they suffered from having odd piece placement.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is worth having though for Bionicle fans, it's probably a bit tricky to come by these days, but if you're a Bionicle fan still looking for these sets then you can't really go wrong with them. They have a good level of potential, they are fun to fiddle and play with and as a bonus you can attach them to the lids of their canisters using a special piece (after folding them up into ball form) and make it look as though they are in hibernation state. I strongly recomend this set to all fans of Bionicle.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"xboxtravis7992","2018-06-29T03:03:04.83Z","Throwback Look at a Childhood Favorite","<p>For some reason, memories of getting certain Lego sets as a kid have still stuck with me as an adult many years later. Kohrak, is one of those; a gift my&nbsp;parents had&nbsp;put in&nbsp;an Easter basket for me during a trip were we spent the holiday with our grandparent&#39;s and cousin&#39;s in southern Utah. Not to mention those early impressions as a kid building the finished figure and being amazed at the uniformity the white color gave, with those sharp transparent blue eyes staring back at me.&nbsp;I can&#39;t really remember how I got the other five Bohrok sets from that year, so when I started thinking of going back and reviewing one of these old Bionicle&nbsp;sets, Kohrak made the most sense to write about.</p>

<p>Back in 2002 when Bionicle was finishing up its freshman year, the line really felt like it had begun to hit full stride with the Bohrok wave. Many fans lamented that the six sets were really just the same design repeated over and over again with different variations in color. However, I think building and playing with a Bohrok in person gives a good sense of all the things early Bionicle was doing <em>right</em>. Still, that clone attribute between the sets has made these figures not age perfectly, with a very weak building aspect to the model.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Packaging &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>I normally avoid talking about boxes in reviews... they are really just a space to display graphic art on a store shelf,&nbsp;and something to be shredded apart to get&nbsp;to the bricks inside once purchased.</p>

<p>But... early Bionicle had a knack for cool packaging designs. Perhaps it was the input from outside artists such as Chris Faber and the team at Advanced that gave the art direction such a unique departure from Lego&#39;s normal style. The canister is cast in transparent plastic, with the Kohrak figure boldly displayed on the front. A keen eye will notice the &quot;hive&quot; in the background is actually stacks of the packaging&nbsp;canisters... suggesting a play opportunity for young fans to stack the canisters from the Bohrok sets they got into forming a miniature slice of &quot;the hive&quot; for themselves. A special connector piece is included, to grab the finished model by the rear and hang it from the lid of the canister to suggest the Bohrok inside is resting in stasis. Such a cool play idea, incorporating the box itself into the experience!<br />
<br />
The instructions continued this goodness. The building steps are computer rendered over a backdrop with the Bohrok logo repeated on the &#39;floor&#39; beneath the model. Comic book style captions aid in the construction, such as a &quot;CLICK&quot; to suggest the sound the head plate makes when it connects with the back of the head frame. A segment of instructions for one of the possible combiner models also come with the set. The back of the booklet has another computer rendered comic; with Tahu facing off against one of the Bohrok inside the hive. The next page displays more rendered shots of the Toa on their quest to fight the Bohrok, and the final page shows all six of the Bohrok sets and all the collectible Krana variants they came with. I recommend taking a moment to use the Brickset instruction feature to take a glance at this, since its pretty impressive how much work went into these little booklets for a $8 set. Via the instructions alone, Lego was able to communicate the basics of the Bionicle story and how the Toa were meant to face off against this new enemy.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>This is where the Bohrok, Kohrak included; began to show weakness... six identical clone designs with minimal variation&nbsp;(12 if you count the Bohrok Kal that came out the following year). I could basically build these in my sleep as a kid, and can still do it all from memory all these years later. The 41 pieces are used to brisk and simple effect, laying down a basic frame for the body, attaching the head gear mechanism, then adding the finishing touches such as the stubby arms and legs. Not the most engaging build, and it will probably seem very rote to most Lego fans. The use of rubber bands in particular is frustrating, considering most of my Bohrok rubber bands would snap over time and have had&nbsp;to be replaced.<br />
<br />
However, the build may have been bland but the parts included were mostly new and very versatile. The body frame pieces, the head frames, the two shields, the head plate, the feet, a pair of teeth, Krana, Krana holder, and the pair of eyes were all brand new pieces when the Bohrok sets were introduced. The eye&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;in particular&nbsp;are still in production with Lego, popping up in various sets and colors&nbsp;across many different themes. The shields for Kohrak were a unique &quot;ice blade&quot; design, and the head plate was dual molded via a marbled method in white and transparent clear colors. All these pieces became staples in Bionicle MOCs for years to come.<br />
<br />
The set highlight though, was the randomly packaged Krana. In the Bionicle lore each Bohrok swarm had eight members, each of whom carried a unique Krana with different abilities depending on their role in the swarm. My set came with the &quot;Krana Za&quot; which according to a quick search on BioSector01 was the Krana used by &quot;Squad Commanders.&quot; Gotta say its a cool looking piece in the light blue color used by this set. There was a&nbsp;collectible aspect to the Krana, with separate blind boxes selling random Krana packaged with a few masks.</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>When finished, the Bohrok design shows off its strengths. Although each set is essential a clone of each other, each one is capable of doing the same play functions which are pretty entertaining in their own right. The&nbsp;Bohrok are able to roll up into a ball, allowing them to be tossed around on the floor or roll along tables not to dismiliar from the Droideka in the Star Wars Prequels. I had to have spent a lot of time as a kid folding up Bohrok, rolling them around, then unfolding them again. Once unfolded, a simple lever/gear combo on the back of the model allows the head of the Bohrok to lunge forward in attack. Or either its lunging forward like a chicken pecking at seeds on the floor... you decide!&nbsp;Leaving the faceplate a little loose, or giving the eyes a solid hit could send the Krana in the head of the model flying out of it and towards a nearby target.&nbsp;In addition there were the aforementioned play features included in the canister itself which I previously discussed. All these features made the Bohrok a blast to play with as a kid.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>As individual models, each Bohrok is lacking due to that omnipresent clone design. However, Kohrak and its ilk encouraged a collectible desire; both with the color variants with&nbsp;each set&nbsp;and the randomly packaged&nbsp;Krana designs. It was a blast to play with these small Bohrok swarms, and I have fond memories looking back on this set as a kid. The cool packing and instruction book details were just icing on the cake, and helped fuel the Bionicle obsession of countless kids back in the early 2000&#39;s.</p>

<p>The lackluster build makes me give this set an average three star rating; but I feel I have to give this set very high marks in Playability. Just writing this review makes me want to get home, unbox one of my Bohrok models in storage and start rolling it around on the floor a bit. At a low price point, the Bohrok were a great entry level set for countless Bionicle fans of that era.&nbsp;</p>
