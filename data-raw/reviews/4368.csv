"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-17T11:50:58.043Z","Possibly My Favorite So Far","Yes, that's right. Bionicle is emerging into it's sixth year, and Onua Nuva, which came out in '02, is still my favorite. Why?

Well, let's start where all my reviews start: With the canistar. The canistar is instantly an eye catcher. Previous canistar sets had metallic colors for their lids. This one, however, has a solid black lid which was a good way for them to stand out among the other sets. The canistar displays the above image on part of the can, and an image of him standing up in a pose on the front part of the can. I assume the back of the canistar has an image of the Toa Nuva group standing together, but all Nuva canisters are currently in storage, so I'm not sure whats back there. 

This set was really fun to build. There were a heap of new pieces from the leg limbs, to the armor. The build was easy enough, nothing real complex about it at all, unless you have trouble with those gear systems. 

This set has some tremendous playability. Not only can Onua hold his Quake Breakers like normal, but they can be attached to the bottom of his feet, used for transportation in the storyline. Most of the Nuva have dual use tools, and I wish it was still a feature. It made the sets that much more exciting. 

But if your not all for playing, Onua Nuva can also be displayed in different poses. You ask how, due to it's dual arm movement via gear systems. The answer is that the set comes with two types of arm connections. One allows you to have dual arm movement, the other allows you to have single arm movement, and use one of the gears to hold the back gear in place by connecting the removed gear into the + rod holder below the other gear. I personally have never done that, but it's a very interesting approach to displaying. 

Overall, Onua Nuva is a fantastic set. He's fun, has high playability and display-ability, and is one of the nicest additions to the Bionicle storyline. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-09T13:59:59.11Z","Strongest Nuva","As toa Nuva, onua looks like more stong because the nuva silver armors, the arms and the weapons. The bohrok arms are short, but cool to use with the drills. Like other nuva, the weapon can be used as some things, the drills have the same function of the kopaka's weapons. The colors, black, silver and dark gray are great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lego_Guru","2008-12-22T21:10:36.233Z","Simply Bliss","A perfect set! This bionicle is my favorite in the nuva series (apart from tahu, and his cool surfboard function!) The possibilities are endless with this 41 piece set! I especially like the change from weapon to transportation, a handy tool when in trouble. The canisters are still my favorite even today. So I give it a 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-03-02T14:57:48.42Z","Onua","Pros~
Chain saws
weapon into transportation means function

Cons~
mask fall off easy
hunchbacked

I give him a 3/5 because his cons just make him pitiful.
You should go to BIONICLEstory.com to watch his and other's minimovies.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2010-01-17T08:02:31.7Z","One of the coolest Toa Nuva around!","Got this along with the other 5 Toa Nuva mint in sealed box from eBay! Onua Nuva is slightly different than the other Toa: His neck is attached to his chest armour, and has shorter arms! He has twin chainsaws, which, when attached to his feet, become rollerblades! Onto the pros and cons:

Pros

Great chainsaws
He has Technic functions(Which are the same as the Toa Metru, so if you have one, you know what those ""functions"" are!)

Cons

As with all Toa Mata and Toa Nuva, he has no knee and elbow articulation!

Overall, a superb set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T10:48:05.54Z","Onua Evolves","<p>Set #8566 Onua Nuva: The Toa Nuva were the same original six only now they were bulkier, had new silver armor parts and different weapons. They were reformatted and along with that reformatting came&nbsp;a more mature look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onua Nuva no longer has clawed hands, now he's got two jagged saw weapons and ordinary looking hands. The weapons attached to his feet so he could... Skate? Well he did something with them, it wasn't pretty I'd wager if he started walking on Bohrok or Rahkshi after knocking them down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New pieces made the legs thicker and the new armor pieces really make these sets stand out, if I was to try and collect six Toa again I'd go for the Toa Nuva as opposed to the originals. The originals had their charms, but I just prefer the upgraded look of the Nuva comparatively. Still if you're looking to score some more Binoicle sets for someone just starting out you can't go wrong the the Toa Nuva. I recommend these sets for anyone who wants to update their original Toa figures as well, plus the pieces are good for any kind of build you may want to indulge in. The new masks are also a nice improvement.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"Codey9","2020-10-20T20:25:27.123Z","A wonderful old set.","<p>The LEGO&nbsp;Bionicle Onua Nuva is a wonderful set. It is now overpriced due&nbsp;to being from 18 years ago, but is still a fun building experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The Onua Nuva, like all other Bionicles, is made from technic pieces and is very flexible. There is a cool feature that can turn both of the arms at once, which is designed unlike anything most Bionicles have done. It can be a problem however if you don&#39;t like both of the arms to always move together, but you can actually change that easily. You can also put his weapons on&nbsp;his feet and use them as treads.</p>

<p>Design:</p>

<p>Onua Nuva has an interesting design, with short arms and with his head on his body. Some may like this, some may not. I&#39;m fine with it.</p>

<p>Pieces:</p>

<p>Nothing too special. Lots of the pieces are large, such as the body, which is one large pre-made piece. The weapons are very cool pieces however. The mask is also very cool.</p>

<p>Price:</p>

<p>The price is horrendously high due to the set being from 18 years ago, but if you can find a new unopened one for 40 to 70 dollars it&#39;s definitely worth it. (I got mine for 50).</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>The LEGO Bionicle Onua Nuva set is wonderful and overall a great set. It&#39;s piece count is very small, but the overall size of the completed set is large. I would recommend it to anyone, especially&nbsp;if you can find it at the price listed above.</p>
