"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-23T14:16:56Z","One Of My Favorite Action Figures","This was the first Toa Nuva I got. His swords double as air katanas, which make him fly.
His mask is the same as his old one, except it allows all those around him to levitate as well.
He looks really good in my army, since he's green like army uniforms.
He has more pieces than the original Lewa, and his armor shines in light, since it is like chrome. 
Lewa is a great addition to your action figure collection. I definitely recommend getting him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Wobo_Ihi","2005-05-18T13:52:08Z","My very first Bionicle set...","The coolest of the Toa Nuva (he has my favourite color, element and weapons)
Mask: Miru Nuva
Element: Air
Power: Levitation
&quot;Tools&quot; (weapons): Air Katanas

What I really like about Bionicle are the Kanohi masks and their amazing story.
I have bought over 40 Bionicle sets over the years, and this one is still one of the greatest.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"18th_Angel","2006-08-28T21:18:34Z","great Nuva","I love this set. he is my fave from the movie. the character suits him perfectly. 

he is much better if you do a few simple modifications to him. it allows him to move his head in any direction and he can store his katana on his back.

articulation is...poor, but he is only really a second gen toa, so he stands out fairly well against all the others in my oppinion.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-24T00:40:11.293Z","Has  a Nice Bit of &quot;Woomph&quot;","The canister of Lewa Nuva is easily the most impressive. Not only does it have the standard upward pose that's standard for canister sets, but it also has an image of Lewa soaring through the air on his Katana &quot;wings&quot;. Pretty much what the graphic to the left (or just look up) is. 

When I first dumped this set out, there were three things that wowed me. One was the size of the mask. It was HUGE compared to the others, and it had a new organic look to it that had a great effect. The other part that stood out where the armor pieces. Some people dislike the Toa Nuva armor, but I think it's great. It's what Toa armor should look like, and not just be a torso piece that's called Toa armor. The last part are the Katana. Really cool swords that give the set that extra &quot;whoomph&quot;. More on the whoomph later. :P

The build is simple, and gives the option for double arm movement or single arm movement with the remaining gear to help hold the position of the arms. One thing that surprised me (and this isn't really beneficial to the review, just a side note) is that the leg pieces are one piece. When I first saw the image of the Toa Nuva on the pre-order sheet, I thought it was the original Toa legs with an attachment. While this would have been preferred to help with the armor trend of the Toa Nuva, it's not anything I'd complain about.

This set is great for both playability and display. Display has two options: 1) Katana out in attack position, 2) Katana displayed as &quot;wings&quot;. The wing function takes a bit less effort than attaching tools to the feet. All you do is switch the shoulder part up a bit, and change the head position. Really nice. 

And about the woomph described earlier, those Katana do look really nice with this Toa, and does add a &quot;woomph&quot; to it. :)

Overall, this is one of the most decent Toa Nuva, and it earns its 5/5 rating. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-01T13:35:55.42Z","HE is the spirict of air","Toa lewa have the mask of levitation, and are the toa nuva of air, it makes he a spirict of air. The mata nui lewa sets are more original because the colors, shapes and weapons. But they are smaller, not a great problem. The air katanas are great usable weapons, but they don't like the classic axe. I rate this set 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Carl","2009-11-01T22:38:47.543Z","""Wind-fly!""","Lewa Nuva is an absolutely great Bionicle. His mask and weapons are some of the best ever made, though maybe his old axe might just be better than his swords. The posability of Lewa Nuva is great and the arm swiveling mechanism is the same as in the original Toa. Very good. The new armour plates are awesome and the new leg pieces look really cool. As usual, the Toa of Air has surpassed all other Toa in terms of awesomeness.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"blaksamu12","2011-01-20T20:59:22.12Z","Awesome!","<p>Lewa Nuva is EPIC!&nbsp; His color scheme is very cool, and his double swords are awesome.&nbsp; I like his function, which works well with his weapons, unlike some of the other Nuva.&nbsp; Out of the Nuva, I have Tahu, Pohatu, and Lewa, and I think Lewa is the best.&nbsp; His mask is also very fierce and cool-looking.&nbsp; I would try to get him off ebay for $8.00 or less.&nbsp; He is the best out of the&nbsp;four Lewas released (Lewa Mata, Nuva, Phantoka, and Axalara).&nbsp; Overall, Lewa Nuva gets at 10/10.</p>

However, when the Bohrok-Kal invade, he is redered powerless! The set in itself is great. High quality, fun, and Lewa all the way! The armor was cool and new mask was too.&nbsp; His air katanas were awesome, and overall, he's.... him.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
