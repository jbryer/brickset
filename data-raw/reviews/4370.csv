"Gus_263","2008-04-13T17:11:15.42Z","Pohatu Nuva","This is the second version of toa Pohatu, and was released in 2002, as one of the main sets. This looks like with the first, but this have some differences, like the new designed masks, armors and weapons. The mask, body and feet are brown, like in his first version. But in this set, have also silver armors on the body, and his firsts weapons, the feet additions, are silver too. The legs were redesigned, and still with the same poseability of the previous ones. In a place of two pieces like in the Pohatu's first set, Pohatu Nuva's set have claws, useful weapons very used in sets later after this. The builting of the set is basically the same of the first version, but in place of balljoints he have armors and the legs are stronger than the others. The gear system is located under the torso, and this makes the legs moves to kick. This set don't have a stone piece, like the first, but is easy kicks too other pieces. The playability is great too, the gear systems makes the set kicks, the arms and claws are poseable, and if the gear system makes he falls (that is hard to happens) this can be stopped with a gear piece. The colors are great, and this first brown version was never more used after this set, unfortunately. This is an useful action figure, with the gear systems, and altough small, is one of the most playable bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T15:44:11.077Z","Get Your Kicks With Pohatu Nuva!!","My favorite part about Pohatu Nuva is his kicking foot.  He doesn't come with a boulder (shame), but it's easy to add one.  He's really fun to play &quot;Kohlii&quot; with.  The claws are new, as well as the armor on his chest and shoulders.  The Mask of Speed looks weird, though.  Otherwise, he's a fine Toa.  Pros and Cons are:

Pros:

-Kicking foot

-Claws can go together to form a make-shift boulder

-Armor

Cons:

-Mask of Speed looks weird

-No boulder

Just like Kopaka (see my review on Kopaka Nuva), he's a decent Toa.  He's definitely worth your money, though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2010-01-17T08:11:24.637Z","The most interesting Toa Nuva around!","Got this along with the other 5 Toa Nuva mint in sealed box from eBay! This Toa Nuva is the most different of all: His WHOLE body is upside-down! In the story, he has HUGE kicking power, and the body is turned upside-down to make his legs kick! Pohatu Nuva also has very short arms! He has claws and feet attachments! Now, onto the pros and cons:

Pros

Different from all other Toa Nuva
When you turn a knob on the back, his legs swing(Just like the Toa Nuva and Toa Metru, except on his legs!)
Great-looking

Cons

As with all Toa Mata and Toa Nuva, he has no knee and elbow articulation!

Overall, one of the best Toa Nuva around!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
