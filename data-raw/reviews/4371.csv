<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bionicle collectors could always use more Krana and Kanohi masks in different colors. Each set of Krana comes with three Krana and two Kanohi. The Kanohi are now in either gold or silver colors. The Krana of course come in a veritable rainbow of hues, some of them unusual compared to the Kanohi because they don't match up with their Bohrok coloring choices. As I mentioned before some were yellow, others purple or a lighter shade of green than Lehvak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though you can't go wrong with accessories for Bionicle. Buying a few of these won't dissapoint and they enhance your Bionicle collection because now you can keep the Krana inside of the Bohrok or Bohrok Va or Bohrok Kal and still attach one to the Toa when they are possessed.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,5
