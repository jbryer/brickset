"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:37:10Z","An unexpected pleasure","By the time I got sucked into the Technic zone, the second-generation sets were becoming prevalent and I couldn’t mow enough lawns or wash enough cars to keep up with my Lego habit.  As soon as I had what I thought was sufficient money for another kit, off I’d go to the nearby toy store to see what set I could afford.  If it was first-generation Technic, then it was on my list.  The 853 and 852 were topmost on the list, but there was little hope for acquiring them – by 1982 they were no longer available.  It also seemed like the 857 was similarly out of reach.  I don’t remember ever having seen it in a store.

Enter good old Dad.  He had to return to the USA for business in 1983.  I had given him a list of hard-to-find sets, complete with their United States alternate designations, and he said he would look if he got a chance.  It didn’t sound promising, since the toy store people said that they just didn’t make those old sets anymore, perhaps a nice 8846 would do?  No way, I’m not giving up.

Anyway, Dad got back to Germany safe and sound, and guess what he found and brought back with him?  Right... an 857 (also an 8858).  Mine is actually the US version, the 8857, but that uniqueness just made it that much better.  I waited until the weekend to build it (had to do a LOT of yardwork first to pay the difference, nothing good comes free), and was entranced by the chain-drive engine – this set exuded realism despite not being complex.  Plus, it’s got a lot of blue pieces, and you can’t go wrong with that.  Scale is roughly that of the 8860, which meant that my sister got to drive quite a few of her dolls around.  The sidecar usually got left off until I built a suspension linkage (with the 8845’s shocks) between the motorcycle and sidecar – it was kludgy but it worked.  

Though it (like all the old school Technics) lacks the refinements of later models, the 857 is a very cool set.  It is still hard to find.  If I ever see another one, you can bet I’ll snap it up quickly, and pull weeds later.  9/10, 25 April 2004

It's also a fairly old one, issued in 79. I was too young at the time to make any money toying around with a motorized lawnmower, so all I had to do was buzz around the folks continuously, eat my vegetables (all of them) &amp; beg. beg. beg. Now it wasn't as expensive as the &quot;autochassis', and my parents always considered Lego as ultimately educative, so yes, some Christmas I got it.

And it rocked, at the time: working piston, chain link, neatly engineered front steering column and, on a top, a very &quot;toyable&quot; item that wasn't intended to stay on display on a shelf with &quot;CAUTION:FRAGILE&quot; tags all around. Looks appealed to the vintage fanatics we where, while this seems to me as a drawback since most Technic Fans where probably eager for some modernity in their sets. Building it was straightforward to the 11-some I was at the time, and every step of the build up showed clever design &amp; pedagogic value: you knew what you where doing &amp; its purpose. The only design flaw of the set is the much-forward sidecar wheel placement that obstructs the passenger &quot;door&quot;: In real life outfits, the third wheel is much more aligned with the back motorcycle wheel, for otherwise the outfit would maneuver very poorly.

Sidecar has a history for me; I own 2 Russian ones, and @ the age I wanted it so badly I was (and still am) a great fan of a French comic book series called &quot;Cubitus&quot; (by Dupa, Lombard Edition, Belgium - that's in French I am afraid!). Characters, a retired Merchant Sailor  &amp; his over-hairy, overweight dog where hilarious and it featured some kind of German pre-WWII contraption in very bad shape, so old it even housed its own ghost in the pannier! Sine then, I always wanted one, Lego or real!

I committed a &quot;Sidecar Reloaded&quot; on MOCpages; for any one interested:

This one seriously lacks Vintage Appeal with its High-Tech suspensions all around, low handlebars, dual headlights, mono swingarm and more.

"FlagsNZ","2014-05-09T06:40:48.987Z","My first and favourite Lego Technic set","<p>This is my first Technic Lego set which was given to me when I was 12 years old in 1980. My father travelled to Norfolk Island which is a duty free island and he brought this home as a present.</p>

<p>I can still remember sitting in my father&#39;s cabin in the ship he worked in being amazed at this set.</p>

<p>The size of the box and the complexity of the build left me speechless.</p>

<p>I can remember being overwhelmed by the&nbsp;<em>technic</em>&nbsp;parts and I started building the model from step 14 which is where the more conventional building skills were needed. Step 14 and onwards is where the mud guards, fuel tank, seat and side car are built with studded&nbsp;parts.</p>

<p>When I got home, I was able to concentrate fully and worked through the first stages and build the chassis and engine.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>I don&#39;t have the box but I still have the original instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I played with this model and built MOCs combined with Technic set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/855-1/Mobile-Crane"">855</a> Mobile Crane. Through hard use, the 16x1&nbsp;and 12x1 blue technic beams suffered. I am fortunate to have obtained replacement beams from <a href=""http://Spareblocks.com"">Spareblocks.com</a>.</p>

<p>The model is now complete in its former glory. I even have the original Lego rubber band on the kick start.</p>

<p>This set included the big wheels. I believe these are Lego&#39;s biggest&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">rubber w</span>heels.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3919/14479725390_2613d24fb5.jpg"" /></p>

<p>These wheels float, and I once made an offshore oil drill platform which floated in a swimming pool. The three wheels provided buoyancy and stability to the drilling tower and platform.</p>

<p>I was able to make dragsters with front wheels being made from the wheels from 855 doubled up.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></h3>

<p>This model remains my favourite Lego set and brings back fond memories. It unleashed years of technical creative play.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The motorcycle engine is mostly concealed&nbsp;underneath the red fuel tank and&nbsp;really&nbsp;can only be seen if the model is upside down. The one <em>square</em>&nbsp;cylinder&nbsp;sounds great as the motorcycle drives along.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2930/14479728570_8964ff8ed6.jpg"" /></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Originally I preferred the model without the side car. I also took off the rear mudguard. The model looks more like a trail bike in this configuration.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This model has always taken pride of place. I am ecstatic that I have been able to return it to its original&nbsp;condition.</p>
