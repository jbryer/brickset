The armor is kick butt and that slashing feature is pretty funny. The mask is OK, and (looks) alot like Tahu Nuva's. Over all a good set, worth the money (but I'd love to get one on sale).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-11T21:17:11Z","Excellent","Gali nuva is the best bionicle i have had since before the toa Metru came out(not that i have one). Though the way you put the wepons on its feet ruins it. And the armor is great i love it. The mask is cool(Unlike Gali's old mask), its way better. plus the old wepons are very wired(i think). I recommend this set to all Gali lovers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T01:30:49Z","Gali Nuva isn't an improvement...","The original Gali was better. Gali Nuva's new mask is ugly and opaque, and the new limb pieces are rather hollow. The armour obscures the technic pieces that made the original look like a true Technic action figure.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-17T12:05:15.043Z","The More Original of the Toa Nuva","First off, the Toa Nuva are my favorite group next to the original Toa. But while Gali Nuva isn't my favorite, she is one of the more original Toa Nuva in the series. 

Starting off with the canistar, we see Gali in two poses. One pose is the above displayed pose. The other one is an image of her standing and holding her Aqua Axes. I can't remember whats on the back of the canistar, sorry.

When you dump out the pieces, you notice (or don't :P) a few things. One of them is the fact that all her limbs are composed of the new limb pieces. The other thing you may notice (new pieces aside) is that her mask is no longer transparent (I was slightly disappointed, but it's not really a deterring factor), and she comes with two protodermic colored mini blades, like the ones you find on those small underwater sets. Strangely enough, I don't think I noticed these until days after I put the set together. Silly me. . .
New pieces now in front, we have the new Toa Nuva limbs x4, which are bulkier than the previous limbs, but a bit hollow. Nothing really wrong with that of course. She also has two big Aqua Axes that look pretty cool, more on those later. Lastly there is the armor, which really makes the set. Nothing screams 'Toa Nuva' like that armor. 

The build is fairly simple. Unlike the majority of the sets, you have two build options when construction the arms. You can either have double arm movement via a gear system, or single arm movement via a gear system. If you choose single arm movement, you can attach the extra gear to a +hole in Gali's back, restricting gear movement for the arm. Pretty cool. 

This set has pretty high playability. You either have Gali hold her Aqua Axes, or they can be attached to her feet. I love the dual-tool options, and I wish Lego had carried that out with the newer sets (Some have it, but most don't). If your into displaying your sets rather than playing with them, you can build it using the single arm movement technique described above. 

Whatever you do with your Bionicle sets, display, collect, play, Gali Nuva, and the rest of the Nuva, are for you. They have options for both hard core players, and dedicated collectors. Gali Nuva on my list gets a five out of five. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lewa_rocks","2007-04-26T00:06:00.607Z","OK set","This one is ok the axes are like the coolest thing in the set the armor is cool I think its a good upgrade from the Toa Olda but im too fond of the mask its a bit wierd for a girl I think the old mask for Gali is better but this mask is ok.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-30T08:42:01.56Z","More toa of water than other toa of water","Gali nuva like more a toa of water than other, because she's features. Only gali nuva have the original propellers and axes to like more a swimmer. The mask don't have the same color of the gali mata but it is another feature. The problems are the legs, same pieces of the arms and the armors, the same of all nuva.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T12:15:05.14Z","Awesome set!","This set is really cool!  I like the propellers and the swords!  I got her at a local store which sells old Lego sets.  I probaly got it in the year 2007.  It is a really cool set!  I wish I had a set that could go with it better then my other sets!
Awesome set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T15:49:23.81Z","Favorite Toa Nuva","Gali is probably the best Toa Nuva you can get, as her mask doesn't look weird like Pohatu's or Lewa's.  I like the propellers on the axes that can become flippers quickly.  The armor is also a nice change from the armorless Toa Mata.  The gear system that is almost lost from Bionicle nowadays is also a good feature.  She earns a fiver with room to spare.  Pros and Cons are:

Pros:

-Axes turn into flippers

-Propellers

-Mask of Water Breathing doesn't look weird

-Gear system

-Armor

Cons:

-Arms and legs are the same

Go get Gali!!  She's worth the money!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-02-21T15:50:23.123Z","toataly cule!","Gali is our second original Toa Nuva. 

Our first was Onua Nuva but he broke from play. 

I think the gear function is annoying.

I hope my brother will take it out.

I wish he bought the Mistika version because the old masks before the Toa 
Metru always fall off.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-24T10:57:31.79Z","Gali Grows Up","<p>Set #8570 Gali Nuva: The last of the three Toa Nuva I managed to pick up was this one, and it is quite a nice looking figure/model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gali Nuva's new pieces give her much better arms and legs, she is wielding two trident like weapons, or perhaps they are more like anchors, which when attached to her feet function as flippers to help her glide more smoothly through the water. Her mask is a much better looking mask compared to the original, I liked the original's transparent effect to simulate Gali's wearing of goggles, but this mask is a marked improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that the Toa Nuva are a great set of six Bionicle models with a bulkier look to them, Gali also serves to look more streamlined thanks to the new limb parts giving her more of that feminine look. If you haven't already picked up the Toa Nuva and are waiting to find a good price, well that's great, but if you're just on the fence about them I'd say you should at least pick up one of them to try them out and see if they're your kind of LEGO.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
