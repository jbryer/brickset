"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T17:32:02Z","Not a great Toa","Kopaka is least favorite toa. Not only because he's Tahu's rival but, his mask looks like it was molded over the hau olda. The double sword just dosen't look right the way it's attached and the sheild's too big.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-24T00:28:03.45Z","A &quot;Cool&quot; Toa Nuva","I apologize for the pun. . .I know it hurt your eyes. :P

The canistar for Kopaka Nuva is like all the other Toa Nuva canisters. It has one graphic of the above image, and another graphic of him in a standing position with the blades in his hands, rather than on his feet. Not sure whats on the back. Like stated in previous Toa Nuva reviews, the Nuva canisters are in storage so I can't look at them. Darn. 

The build for this set is pretty easy. It's just like building one of the original Toa, but with new limb pieces and the addition of extra armor. 

The finished product is very decent, with the only issue being that the shield can't rotate at the wrist area, but that's very minor. It's a very good set otherwise. The ice blade is creative, with it being both a double ended weapon, and skis. This double feature with the weapon gives Kopaka a lot of playability. But if you aren't into playability, you can display your set. And check this out, the set comes with a few extra parts to allow to the double armed gear motion to become a single armed gear motion. The extra gear goes on the back to prevent the arms from falling if lifted (as if to pose the set)

Overall, Kopaka Nuva is a very decent set. He has a lot of playability and it's a decent looking set, too. This earns a final rating of 5/5

Cool shield setup

Sheild holder piece wears down easily and sheild drops off easy",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-09T14:07:09.733Z","Great than kopaka","Kopaka nuva looks like cool than kopaka. But with some additions. He don't have one sword, but two. The shield is greater, and the weapon have a new function. The mask can be maded with the old hau, but it is cool too. He also have the nuva armors and light gray pieces.

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T15:38:36.92Z","Good Toa Nuva","He's a lot different than the original, but at the same time you can tell they're the same Toa.  I like the shield that's actually solid instead of being filled with holes and the dual sword that can become big skis.  The mask doesn't have a hole in it like Toa Metru Nuju, though, which is kinda weird.  It looks like he's shutting that eye.  Oh well, I guess it's not too bad.  The armor is also better than the original.

Pros:

-Shield is solid

-Dual sword becomes skis

-Armor

-Mask of Telescopic Vision is new

Cons:

-There isn't a hole for him to look through the telescope in his mask

All in all, he's a decent Toa Nuva.  Not my favorite, though",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-29T17:27:50.103Z","Toa of Ice","<p>Set #8571 Kopaka Nuva: As I already mentioned I really liked the Bionicle Technic theme, it impressed me in ways that Throwbots could not, the figures were all very well proportioned and built with sturdy pieces that gave you a lot of potential for MOCing or MODing in anyway you saw fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately spaceing kept these figures from remaining with me, with a few small exceptions. I was quite partial to the white colored Toa of Ice, he and his similarily colored companions really intrigued me. And I think they look good as a set, I'm going to try and pick up the matching toned Visorak to complete the theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to the review. Kopaka Nuva uses old and new pieces to take the much smaller Kopaka from the first series of Toa and transform him into something truly epic. The bulk of the figure is improved upon and the newer Nuva Masks of Power gave the Toa a grittier looking edge. (At least in my opinion.) It was like... Well the first batch of Toa were children in their teen years and the Toa Nuva represented adult versions of the same character, if I can make such a comparison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I found slightly off-putting about the Toa was their gear activated gimmic arms. True these allowed the figures to move and be played with, but unlike the Rahkshi or Bohrok the Toa's gimmick tends to hinder their poseability. The geared arms are always sagging. Though it is possible to build the model without using the gears, if you have a few spare connector pieces lying around, then you could really make some dynamic poses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another feature of Toa Nuva was the odd ability to take their weapons and attach them to their feet, for whatever reason LEGO chose to do this, and it does add a bit to the figure, but it is still a bit of an oddity. So basically Kopaka Nuva is attacking you with his ice skates, when he puts them on his feet that's what you get. Ice Skating Kopaka.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set had a few extra pieces so that both arms could become gimmicked with the gear function, making it possible for both arms to be swung wildly up and down to fight and do battle against the enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like this set still and am glad I held onto it. If you're still not sure about some Bionicle items or if you started off with the later stuff and are trying to decide which older sets you should track down, I highly recommend all of the Toa Nuva over their adolescent original forms. Plus these are the designs used by the animators for the first Bionicle movie... Modified of course to give them proper hands in the film.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Nmfrey23","2022-06-04T02:10:27.837Z","Kopaka's upgrade","<p>The Toa Nuva aren&#39;t anything outstanding altogether since&nbsp;they take builds similar to the Toa Mata from the year prior, and add new masks, weapons, and armour pieces, thus giving them a sleek and updated look. While this transition was awkward for some Toa Mata sets, I believe that this set improves on many of the flaws present in Kopaka&#39;s 2001 set while still looking just as good.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: The swords, legs, armour pieces and mask are all new to LEGO, and the shield is new to Bionicle specifically (but not to LEGO).</p>

<p>Arm movement: Kopaka&#39;s shoulders aren&#39;t attached like they were in the 2001 set. In that set, his shoulders were narrower, making his gear function operate in a stiff manner. This set fixes that issue and broadens his shoulders, letting the gear function move freely along with the arm.</p>

<p>Kopaka has a bigger shield along with a friction pin to aim where the shield is. His past set iteration featured a significantly smaller shield that may have looked odd to some, and his left arm was totally static at the shoulder.</p>

<p>Gear function allows the right arm to be swung up and down.</p>

<p>The swords double as ice skates.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>New&nbsp;leg parts limit forward leg movement (slightly).</p>

<p>Some may not like the style of the Toa Nuva masks since they appear somewhat warped and skin-like. It all comes down to personal preference. Personally, I think that this mask looks great in this set.</p>

<p>The edges of the shoulder armour and chest plate can fray easily.</p>

<p>Some may not like the use of a Toa Mata arm on the left side of the set (be it for asymmetry or lack of an elbow).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Toa Nuva are all solid sets, but Kopaka is my favourite of them. The transition from Toa Mata to Toa Nuva came so seamlessly in this set, making Kopaka look just a cool as his 2001 set if not better. I would highly recommend this set&nbsp;to anyone looking for either a good set to get acclimated with Bionicle, or to fans who are looking to build something new. Regarding both build and overall look, this set shouldn&#39;t disappoint. 4/5</p>
