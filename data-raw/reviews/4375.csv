"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-23T14:56:33Z","A Must-Have for An Action Figure Collector","This a really awesome Toa Nuva. His swords convert into a surfboard, and he can surf on lava.
The style limb they used for Tahu is wonderful, because from the side it looks like muscle. 
The only downside to this set (which doesn't matter to me much) is that he looks wierd with his head while he's on the surf board.
This is a set that any action figure lover should want.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-06T15:30:44Z","Worst Toa Nuva","I just don't like the look of Tahu Nuva. Something about him. He's lacking poseability, and his swords are customised to fire, which means they only look good on red MoCs. His 2nd weapon mode isn't that good either.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"greg_duncan","2007-10-08T19:20:23.31Z","Oldschool appeal","I haven't written a review in nearly a year, but playing with this guy recently got me thnking about how awesome this set is even after all these years. I missed out on tahu nuva the first go around, and waited until he was reasonably priced on Ebay. I'd wanted this guy from the beginning, but could never find him in stores. The wait, I'm happy to say, was totally worth it. He is one of the coolest action figures Lego has ever produced, and new and old Lego fans alike can get behind this set, with its cool action features, great parts and oldschool bionicle appeal. I am left highly recommending this set to any and every lego fan who can find him. you ill not be disappointed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-08-07T18:39:52.55Z","Searching for this one...","This set was finally found by me just in '05 after searching for it ever since the toa nuva came out.  I got all the rest of them, then I looked for this one all over, then found it on a clearance table in Legoland for like $5.  Anyway, I'll stop the war story.

Pros:
-Nice Colors
-Well designed mask
-Good fire swords.

Cons:
-Really can't play with it more than once, after you whack the bad guys, you cant really whack them different (pretty much my standard Bionicle con.)

"Gus_263","2008-04-12T18:33:20.357Z","Powerful Toa Nuva of fire","This set is one of the bionicle sets released in the year of 2002, this is Tahu Nuva. Like the original Tahu, this is nice made and have a cool design, colors (the original red scheme, some orange, silver and black in few details). The feet are in the same shape of the Toa Nuva and &quot;Toa Mata&quot;, but in red color. The legs, like other Nuva, have a good size in comparison with the body size, have also, inside it, the old gear systems, from bionicle of 2001-2003 (some of the sets from the Bionicle theme released in 2004 and 2005 also have gear systems but have different working and building), that altough is no much playable like the new (too because the arms aren't made with more than one piece), but still cool in relation with the size of the set, and anyone can stop the gear system, if this wish to make it, anyone can pose this set. Tahu Nuva also have two nice magma swords, good weapons for any creation with bionicle, and these makes another effect, when fit on a foot, can make a cool &quot;surfboard&quot;. Tahu, like the other Toa Nuva, have two silver pieces, used as armors, on each shoulder, that makes it better, like the silver armor on the chest makes. The head is good positioned, for the body, and it have a old design of bionicle heads, great. The piece used as the red eyes, have the better color for a red bionicle character. The mask is the Hau Nuva, not better than the original Hau, but it still cool and well detailed for a mask, have also some characteristics of the original Hau. Altough this set is small and have the old building systems of the first bionicle sets, this is playable, cool, detailed and was also more cheap than the new (now it is so much rare, so, much more expensive). Another cool classic bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wadaltmon","2008-12-13T20:08:15.28Z","Ooh... New Shiny Armor","As a Toa Nuva, a very old set, I was surprised at the design. I thought it would be just like the old Tahu, only with a new mask and armor. But no, theis set is much more than that. I love how you can attatch the two swords on the foot to make a surfboard. Definitely a must-have for a LEGO collector!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"buzzandwoody2000","2009-12-31T08:36:10.75Z","TAHU IS GREAT! (SCREAMS OUT LOUD)","Tahu is one of my favorite Toa Nuva, and I recevied him from a friend with tons of other Bionicles. I have all of the Nuva now, because I recently orderd Lewa Nuva off of Bricklick, with the green Rakshi and Borok, so I was missing those, and I have all Toa Nuva, Borok and Rahkshi.
This set is great; I love Tahu's surfboard features. The swords are nice, too!

"greshmalum","2009-05-04T12:28:19.043Z","Tahu Nuva!","Tahu has the Mask of Shielding.
 
You can get him on eBay, and you can also get an infected [with green lines on it] one too. 

You can get it in red, blue, black, white, green, brown, probably silver, infected, and probably gold. Maybe in other colors too. 

Tahu's Lava Swords can do three things- sword mode, staff mode, and lavaboard mode. 

He is the leader of the Toa Nuva. 

As with most of the old bionicles, he is perfect!

"Alemas","2010-03-03T13:34:29.093Z","Tahu Nuva... he would become one of the most important Toa ever...","<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Tahu Nuva was launched in 2002, a year of change for LEGO. 2002 introduced new pieces, and also a new chapter in the Bionicle storyline. Tahu Nuva is the leader of the Toa Nuva, and wields the elemental power of fire.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A gear system to &quot;swing&quot; the arms in opposite directions</li>
    <li>A head to which the Krana of the Bohrok or Bohrok-Kal can be attached</li>
    <li>When you attach the two swords to Tahu's feet, they make a lava-board!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Building Experience</h4>
<p>Mind you, this has WAY less pieces than today's Toa(excluding Stars). I think it took me... 5 minutes to build this. A pleasing build. 4/5</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>Ho-boy, this has LOADS of cool parts: Silver swords, silver armour, the Hau Nuva mask, and some gears! 5/5</p>
<h4>Playability</h4>
<p>Playability takes a knock because this has no knee articulation. However, the arms allow pretty good freedom of moment, which helps when you want to destroy pesky Bohrok! :) Also, the lava-board is REALLY cool. 4/5</p>
<h4>Value for Money</h4>
<p>Ho-hum... I bought this from eBay(along with the other Toa Nuva), and I can't remember the price, so I got to base myself on Brickset's mentioned price... &pound;4.99 is pretty cheap for this, so it scores highly. 5/5</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Playability is good, the good selection of parts can make many a good MOC, and the features really make this a great set! Get if you can!<br />
