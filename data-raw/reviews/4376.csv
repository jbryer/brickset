"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-07T19:51:58.827Z","Looks cool","Out of the six, this one looks more intimidating, because of the chainsaws for the weapons. It doesn't fling anything and needs to be close range to it's enemy to do some damage. Because of this, i'm giving it a 4, but thats pretty good!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-09T14:13:29.437Z","Kal of earth","The legs and arms are cool, in black color. The head and it's elements, teeths, eyes gears, are the same of bohrok-kal, changing only the symbols. As a set similar to others, it is a great thing to creations. The silver pieces, including the gravity shield are awesome. The krana color like a orange gold.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2009-03-08T19:36:51.653Z","The best Bohrok-Kal","I just got him yesterday along with Tahnok, Tahnok-Kal, Lehrak-Kal and , Pahrak-Kal. I got them in trade for several Attacktix Battle Figures. He is my favorite Bohrok-Kal, because of his gravity shields, and I think that he's just plain cool!<br/><br/>pros.<br/>black/silver colors<br/>Krana<br/>gravity shields<br/>good, compact design<br/>rolls up into a ball<br/>head springs forward<br/><br/>cons.<br/>Krana looks bad on Toa<br/>Krana only fits on most 2001-2004 Bionicles<br/><br/>This is the best Bohrok-Kal. If you like Bionicles, you will probably like him.",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T12:57:26.937Z","Cool set!","This is a really cool set!  I like how you can make him roll in a ball!  I like the mask also!  He is really cool!  I bought him off of Ebay in 2006.  (I think)  I like his arms too.  They are xool!  He is a really cool set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T08:11:25.043Z","Is this guy familiar or is it just me?","&quot;This looks vaguely familiar Ed, hey wait, is that a Bohrok?&quot; &quot;No, Ted, it's a Bohrok-Kal&quot;, &quot;what's the difference, Ed?&quot;, &quot;I don't know, Ted, but it sure looks cool!&quot;

Yup, that's right, the exact same design as the Bohrok, but this is slightly justifiable, since the Toa got an upgrade, so their enemies deserve one too...

Every Bohrok-Kal is the same, with the exception of the colors, the weopons, and the mask color. What saves this the pitiful rating of the vahki, is that these had collectible masks that fit the toa (and they didn't look half bad!).
Each bohrok (-kal too) has the same design, a round body, curved joint arms and legs, mini feet, rounded weapons, buggy eyes, and a head with a mask launching mechanism in the back. They can also roll into a ball and be stored in their capsules.

This Bohrok scores a 4/5 on the Bohrok-Kal scale, since the weapons are cool and the mask color is decent. The silvery colors are awesome and the buzz saws are very fearsome. All in all one of the better Bohrok.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-07T14:05:54.92Z","MY first Bohrok-Kal.","Nuhvok-Kal was my first Bohrok-Kal and really got me into Bionicle after a one year leave of absense after getting Onua Mata. My favourite thing about the Bohrok-Kal and the Rahkshi is that each one came with a collectible piece that you could fit on a Toa or Matoran's head. Nuhvok-Kal is possibly the most menacing Bohrok-Kal due to the fact that his weapons are chainsaws. My favourite qualities of these little guys are the fact that they can roll up into balls and lash their heads out at Toa.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
