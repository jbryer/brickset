I like the background of the set, with a volcano and lava in the picture. I would say that if you only had one choice outof all of them, i would say, pick this one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-01T17:33:45.967Z","Tahnok Kal","This set is really so much like the other bohrok kal and also bohrok. Tahnok kal have a cool color combination (red, silver and some blue), good playability, an awesome gear system with elastics that do the bohrok kal strikes with the head and launch the krana kal, a nice repaint of the original krana. Another feature on each bohrok kal is the shift possibilities, like the bohrok, the bohrok kal can shift in a sphere form, and rolls very well. This set is old, simple, but also great. I rate Tahnok kal 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T08:12:36.043Z","Is this guy familiar or is it just me?","&quot;This looks vaguely familiar Ed, hey wait, is that a Bohrok?&quot; &quot;No, Ted, it's a Bohrok-Kal&quot;, &quot;what's the difference, Ed?&quot;, &quot;I don't know, Ted, but it sure looks cool!&quot;

Yup, that's right, the exact same design as the Bohrok, but this is slightly justifiable, since the Toa got an upgrade, so their enemies deserve one too...

Every Bohrok-Kal is the same, with the exception of the colors, the weopons, and the mask color. What saves this the pitiful rating of the vahki, is that these had collectible masks that fit the toa (and they didn't look half bad!).
Each bohrok (-kal too) has the same design, a round body, curved joint arms and legs, mini feet, rounded weapons, buggy eyes, and a head with a mask launching mechanism in the back.

This Bohrok scores a 3/5, since the weapons are OK, but the colors are really cool. The mask is great, but not much is exceptional...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
