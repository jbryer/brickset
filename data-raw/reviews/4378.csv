"greg_duncan","2005-12-31T13:59:43Z","fantastic","this set was the first bionicle I ever bought(believe it or not).I loved it. although its just a bohrok with silver and new tools, it has a coolness factor the original bohrok never quite had. I hope anyone who would like one of these manages to find one, on ebay or something because this is a great set to have.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-07T19:57:28.263Z","Ice climber?!","This set i really need to say the flaws because this really doesn't look like a iceclimber! The hands or the weaponery looks like a snowflake or something that doesn't have to do with snow. I thought that it could be a pick, like the picks that are used to grab hold of rocks, but i really aren't sure.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Well, onto the pros. and cons.<br/><br/>Pros.<br/>cool how he rolls up into a ball<br/>nice weapons<br/>I like how you can move his head<br/><br/>Cons.<br/>way too small (compared to the new bad guys he doesn't look very powerful)<br/><br/>Overall, good set but I lost a lot of interest in him after I bought Kopaka and Chirox.",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Gus_263","2008-03-04T14:25:28.7Z","Great","My favorite bohrok swarm is the kohrak, and this is the elite of they. The sonic shields don't like shields, or things to make he climb, but is very well designed. The eye colors are awesome, and of his body, silver and white looks very clear. Also featuring the capability to shift in sphere, moves the head, make a combination and carry a krana, this set is great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T08:14:22.217Z","Is this guy familiar or is it just me?","&quot;This looks vaguely familiar Ed, hey wait, is that a Bohrok?&quot; &quot;No, Ted, it's a Bohrok-Kal&quot;, &quot;what's the difference, Ed?&quot;, &quot;I don't know, Ted, but it sure looks cool!&quot;

Yup, that's right, the exact same design as the Bohrok, but this is slightly justifiable, since the Toa got an upgrade, so their enemies deserve one too...

Every Bohrok-Kal is the same, with the exception of the colors, the weopons, and the mask color. What saves this the pitiful rating of the vahki, is that these had collectible masks that fit the toa (and they didn't look half bad!).
Each bohrok (-kal too) has the same design, a round body, curved joint arms and legs, mini feet, rounded weapons, buggy eyes, and a head with a mask launching mechanism in the back.

This Bohrok easily scores a 5/5 on the Bohrok-Kal scale, since the Mask is really cool and the multi-buzzsaws are exceptionally cool. Like the other white Bohrok this one was slightly harder to find.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-18T01:19:19.89Z","""What was that? Sounded like a sonic boom""","This is the first Bionicle I ever got. He is surprisingly pose-able. The Krana-Kal got ruined though, and no longer can fit in the headpiece. This I consider a small problem because the shell, unlike the standard Bohrok, is not translucent, so you can't tell if he has it in or not. The shields are cool-looking, and good for MOCs.

Pros:
Rare-colored eyes.
Head can snap forward.
Shields look good on him.
Nice, well-designed torso.
Can roll up into a ball

Cons:
Legs are not as pose-able as I would like them.

A great classic for any Bionicle fan. If you get it keep the Krana- Kal in the head piece.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
