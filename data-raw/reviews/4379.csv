I also got Nuhvok-Kal, Tahnok-Kal, Pahrak-Kal, and Tahnok in that trade. It was definately worth it! You get a host of good pieces for MOCs, especially the vaccum shields.

Yup, that's right, the exact same design as the Bohrok, but this is slightly justifiable, since the Toa got an upgrade, so their enemies deserve one too...

Every Bohrok-Kal is the same, with the exception of the colors, the weopons, and the mask color. What saves this the pitiful rating of the vahki, is that these had collectible masks that fit the toa (and they didn't look half bad!).
Each bohrok (-kal too) has the same design, a round body, curved joint arms and legs, mini feet, rounded weapons, buggy eyes, and a head with a mask launching mechanism in the back.

Easily a 5/5, this guy's claws are really cool, and due to their shape, have the ability to spark an imagination into making them shoot lasers (I think the storyline said something about sucking air in and firing sonic blasts). On top of that, the green is really spectacular, but it is still a Bohrok, even if it is a &quot;Kal&quot;, it is still a Bohrok, and thus all 6 are identical (YAWN!).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
