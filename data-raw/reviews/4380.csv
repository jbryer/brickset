This one seems to be the coolest, but all of the bohrok mainly have the same thing, thats why i'm giving it a 4. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-04T14:19:57.14Z","Cool","This is a great set. The bohrok like the same thing. But little things, like the shields, design on head and colors are different. These are cool, the krana color of pahrak-kal is awesome, a black scheme; and the shields of plasma. The combination is included in the instructions, and this also can shift to sphere. The gears systems makes the head moves.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T08:19:45.763Z","Is this guy familiar or is it just me?","&quot;This looks vaguely familiar Ed, hey wait, is that a Bohrok?&quot; &quot;No, Ted, it's a Bohrok-Kal&quot;, &quot;what's the difference, Ed?&quot;, &quot;I don't know, Ted, but it sure looks cool!&quot;

Yup, that's right, the exact same design as the Bohrok, but this is slightly justifiable, since the Toa got an upgrade, so their enemies deserve one too...

Every Bohrok-Kal is the same, with the exception of the colors, the weopons, and the mask color. What saves this the pitiful rating of the vahki, is that these had collectible masks that fit the toa (and they didn't look half bad!).
Each bohrok (-kal too) has the same design, a round body, curved joint arms and legs, mini feet, rounded weapons, buggy eyes, and a head with a mask launching mechanism in the back.

Yet another Bohrok-Kal, but this is one of the lesser Bohrok, since the weapons are not as scary looking, and thus gets itself a 2/5 on the Bohrok-Kal scale. The colors aren't that great, and being a Bionicle doesn't save this one...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
