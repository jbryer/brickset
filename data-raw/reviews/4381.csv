"Gus_263","2008-03-01T17:41:12.2Z","One of the best bionicle sets ever maded","Gahlok kal, like the other Bohrok kal is a classic set. Gahlok kal features a nice color scheme (blue, silver and some orange pieces), useful pieces, good playability with the small legs and arms like the other bohrok kal, that also do a spherical form. This set have a gear system that do the head of the bohrok strikes and launch the krana kal (a original krana with another color, in a good repainting)on the air. The shields are well designed and do a cool effect on some other bionicle sets. Gahlok kal is in overall, a awesome set that is a good option for have fun. I rate this set 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T08:21:38.733Z","Is this guy familiar or is it just me?","&quot;This looks vaguely familiar Ed, hey wait, is that a Bohrok?&quot; &quot;No, Ted, it's a Bohrok-Kal&quot;, &quot;what's the difference, Ed?&quot;, &quot;I don't know, Ted, but it sure looks cool!&quot;

Yup, that's right, the exact same design as the Bohrok, but this is slightly justifiable, since the Toa got an upgrade, so their enemies deserve one too...

Every Bohrok-Kal is the same, with the exception of the colors, the weopons, and the mask color. What saves this the pitiful rating of the vahki, is that these had collectible masks that fit the toa (and they didn't look half bad!).
Each bohrok (-kal too) has the same design, a round body, curved joint arms and legs, mini feet, rounded weapons, buggy eyes, and a head with a mask launching mechanism in the back.

The last of the Bohrok-Kal, it's finally over. This one is a sad-sack 2/5 on the Bohrok-Kal scale, since the weapons are lacking, the colors are only OK, but no better. This is a disgrace to the Bionicle name, not even the metallic colors will save it now...",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-18T16:07:56.61Z","Favorite Bohrok-Kal","And you know why?  Because he's my ONLY Bohrok-Kal! LOL.  

Ok, enough of the funny business, this is a good set.  If you wanna talk storyline, this is one of the six Bohrok-Kal who awoke to replace the imprisoned Bahrag queens, the 'generals' of the Bohrok swarms.  The Bohrok-Kal command unique powers from the other similar Bohrok; Gahlok-Kal, for example, doesn't control water, but magnetism.  Pretty powerful ability if you ask me.  Anyway, the Bohrok-Kal stole the Toa Nuva's Nuva Symbols, special symbols that contain the relatively new Toas' elemental control.  Once the Bohrok-Kal had these in their control, the Toa Nuva were helpless without their Elemental abilities, left only with their weapons and mask powers. The Toa defeated the Bohrok-Kal, tricking them with their own intelligent lust for power.  The Bohrok-Kal tried controlling the elemental abilities contained in the symbols, but failed, destroying themselves.

This Bohrok is my one and only Kal, and unfortunately I broke him up a while ago.  Fortunately, I was able to completely build him back!  Yay!

Anyway, let's talk about Gahlok-Kal in terms of pieces and an action figure.  He has many reused pieces in new colors, like the hood piece containing the Krana-Kal, which is, by the way, a silvery blue instead of the previous orange.  The shields are new pieces, and very cool, working well with the magnetism control.  Like the Bohrok, he can shoot his head forward, smashing up LEGO bricks and other such obstructions.

Other than new colors, Gahlok-Kal is just a Bohrok with a -Kal attachment on his name, Gahlok-Kal.  This can be a good thing and a bad thing, I guess... Anyway, onto Pros and Cons for Gahlok-Kal:

Pros:

-New, re-colored pieces

-Rolls into a ball

-Can shoot it's head forward, like other Bohrok

-New Krana-Kal

Cons:

-Clone (other than colors)

Altogether 4.7/5.  Great set, never once have regretted buying him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
