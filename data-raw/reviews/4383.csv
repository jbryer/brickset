I like these because you have something &quot;alive&quot; that you can collect, play, battle. 
I like these because if you don't have pets, you can pretend they are your pets.
The downsides are there are only three per container, when you can fit maybe nine. You should get more for your money.
Also, they are made of rubber, which means when you put them in a shoebox, they roll over.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Coming in a pack of three when it could (with much cramming) fit like all my kraata is a bit of a cheek, but you DO get an awesome sticker! I got 4 of these pots. Best collectables ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The pack is also good designed, but unfortunately it came with only three kraata. The variation of the Kraata are so expressive and if you have Rahkshi, they will do more fun. I just rate it 4/5 due to few pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<ul>
	<li>Great collectable, better than squid.</li>
	<li>Unique colors not available in Rahkshi.</li>
	<li>Canisters are stackable, and lid has a pin hole.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Bad:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>You only get three.</li>
	<li>Price, then again, collectibles have always cost this much.</li>
	<li>Only really useful with Rahkshi.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Verdict:</h4>

<p>One of the better collectibles, like the squid, except they have character. For what they are, they are great.</p>
