The Matoran construction is pretty cool, and it makes them almost super posable.
The Kolhii staff included is also pretty cool, and the Matoran can pass to each other and shoot goals.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 16 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for a figure like this.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8581-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The
 arms, the hands the legs and the feet can be adjusted. On the back of the 
torso is a gear which you can use to sviwel the torso to the right and/or 
to the left. This figure also has a hockey stick. This set also comes with a puck which you can put into the hockey stick very easily as well. I 
really like this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
