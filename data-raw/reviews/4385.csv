I like his kolhi stick but the ball is not at all like a kolhi ball but thats not too bad though. Overall matoro is a good little matoran:)",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

I like him because he's like Kopaka.
I gave it a 4 because of the weird kohlii &quot;ball&quot;. And it does have the cool colored legs and mask. The kohlii stick itself is cool. The top of it is cool because it holds the &quot;ball&quot;.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T13:10:41.42Z","A classic matoran","One of my favorites, a courageous matoran that was a translator and turns in toa sacrificing himself to save the great spirict. In his matoran form of kohlii player is also a good set, but don't moves very well. The mask is the same of kopaka with a great color. He isn't showed in the movie, but he is coolest than some showed in it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 16 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8582-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands the legs and the feet can be moved. On the back of the torso is a gear which you can use to move the torso to the right and/or to the left. This figure also has a hockey stick with a puck in it. I really like this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
