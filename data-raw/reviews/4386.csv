"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-02T20:38:22Z","Coolest little guy!","I love all bionicle, and this is my fave matoran (all the little guys)!  Hahli is a nice small set, and she can swing her arms back and forth!  Her mask is cool since it is transparent, and she is very flexible!  She also comes with a Kolhii (the bionicle sport) stick and ball, which she can actually play kolhii with!  A great little set for a small price!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-07T20:40:46.39Z","Oh yeah!","I saw this set in the movie, in the exciting scene when they score last minute. My aunt knew how cool the movie was to me and decided to buy the character for me. I was thrilled. I kept on playing with it but soon however, the legs and joints could not hold up the torso and head. I was so sad. That was the last time i plaed with it. So remember, if you like a set, but play with it to much, it will wear and will not be playable!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T12:45:17.873Z","Hahli rebuilted","This is a interesting matoran form, have bohrok arms, and are greater tha the first. They aren't very playable, only to kohlii moves. I like these matorans no much, only by the forms and storyline (the movie no much, i think that the movie shows little things only of bionicle). The kohlii stick, and the ball( it looks like a disk are cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T11:36:01.89Z","Downfall","This was the year in my mind where Bionicle changed for the worse. This set is still okay but Matorans are supposed to be simple villagers and suddenly they don't carry weapons to help them defend themselves when the Toa aren't around but instead they carry their versions of Hockey sticks. You can't even move the puck using the stick fast and how dare they give him Gali's mask.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-18T20:30:56.84Z","I finally have all of the versions of Hahli!","I bought a bonus pack from Bricklink with Hewkii, Hahli and a golden Avohkii (I was going to give Hewkii to my bro for Christmas), and he didn't mind if I kept Hahli and the mask for myself (he loves Hewkii BTW).  Anyway, this is always been one of the old sets foremost in my mind to get.  Surprisingly, the parts are much darker than I had originally thought.  They are navy blue, instead of 'Macku' or normal blue.  She's really playable, and has pieces that are unique to 2003 Matoran, such as the swiveling torso piece.

Pros:

-I got it brand new, in unopened packaging! :D

-Kohlii stick and puck

-Finally I have all the versions!

-Key character in the Mask of Light movie

Cons:

-None come to mind

In short, get Hahli!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-15T07:27:19.497Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Hahli Review","<p>This is a great figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 16 cents per piece which is a really good value for what we get here.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8583-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the legs, the legs and the feet can be adjusted. We also get a hockey stick with a puck which you can put into the stick very easily. I really can't complain about this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
