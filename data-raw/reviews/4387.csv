The colors are awesome, the brown was a good color, but it don't appears in the newest sets. The kohlii stick and the ball can beplayed with the matoran's moves. He isn't very playable, but is a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 16 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for this figure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>

 arms, the hands the legs and the feet can be adjusted and on the back of 
the 
torso is a gear which you can use to move the torso to the right 
and/or 
to the left. This figure also has a hockey stick which has a puck in it. You can take out the puck of the hockey stick very easily as well.
 I 
really like this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
