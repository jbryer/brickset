"Gus_263","2008-02-22T12:53:10.7Z","New version of hafu","Taller, and a cooler version. Don't very playable, but includes good colors and mask, that makes he different than the other matoran. The kohlii stick and ball(looks like a disk)can be find in any 03' matoran",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces and it was 4 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 16 cents per piece 
which is a really good value for this figure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>

 arms, the hands the legs and the feet can be moved and on the back of 
the 
torso is a gear which you can use to sviwel the torso to the right

to the left. This figure also has a hockey stick which has a puck in it which you can take out very easily.
 I 
really like this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>

"bajadogq","2009-12-14T22:53:24Z","The Greatest Matoran of All Time","Hafu is a brilliant little set. He has a great color scheme and a Kolhii Stick, which can be swung back and forth by turning a knob on his back. His build is simple yet satisfying.

Pros:
- Kolhii Stick and Puck
- Swinging Feature
- IT'S HAFU!

Cons:
- Eyes are gray, not green. :(

Overall, a brilliant set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
