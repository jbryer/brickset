What is so great about this set is also it's details: It's a perfect crossover between City and Castle, the chairs in the corner where people can sit quietly; The great treepiece... But also the fact that the little red shop had decals so it couldsell icecream in the summer and soup in the winter... Good thinking too to include multiple numbers for the decals, which permitted kids to use their pieces for other stuff, and later recreate the set with all the decals included! Truly magnificent, and a great job by LEGO. So, when do we get it back as a Legend...?

Of course, the fact that it has not been wide-spread available. It often seems that Lego, as a company policy, refuses to offer the general public a fair chance on getting the satisfaction of owning the best sets they've designed.

This set works miracles for the heart of your town, especially when you've got the opportunity to combine this set with the 1589 'weetabix' main street and the 375 yellow castle. After you've created a cluster of buildings that sit within the boundaries of the 'old city walls' and build the rest of your town around it, it will really spurr your town to life.
Don't forget to take a closer look on the car in this set; the fender-piece over the front wheels has never been used in a more beautiful manner.

On a final note, I disagree with the other reviewer on this set: My love for this set is very firmly rooted in my years as a youth, when I most certainly still belonged to the target group, and I don't believe that the children of today differ that much from children two or three decades ago. The Lego Company is still in the process of learning that lesson... And showing progress, I must add.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
