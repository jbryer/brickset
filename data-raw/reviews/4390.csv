"Gus_263","2008-02-29T15:14:31.013Z","Awesome rahkshi","This rahkshi features the brown. He isn't from the stone element, and have a staff  of desintegration. The kraata features colors that looks like the pohatu colors. The spine is great, and have a different design to the other rahkshi, but the head, legs and arms are the same, it can be used some in creations, and more, in the kaita. The head is a bionicle hand with an orange-like color. The staff was used later in the rahaga pouks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it as well.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>There're lot's of great and useful pieces included in this set which are always great to have for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. The kraata we get in this set is rubbery.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

If you push the head you can see a kraata on the back. On the back of the figure you can see a gear which makes the arms moving to the right and to the left. The design of this set looks really cool and the stuff looks great, too.<br></span></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-03T17:22:08.907Z","Rahkshi Serve Makuta","<p>Set #8587 Rahkshi Panrahk: Finally back to my reviewing here we go finishing up all the Bionicle sets I once owned. The six Rahkshi were great additions to my Bionicle collection, I managed to score all six at a very good price from Costco in two sets of three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rahkshi Panrahk is intended to battle Toa Pohatu Nuva - at least according to his color scheme. He is the brown Rahkshi and has an impressive looking build, I actually enjoyed the Rahkshi better because of their knee joints due to the method in which they are constructed. These Bionicle figures are suitably lithe and menacing looking with almost that hunched over quality many villainous minions possess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it weren't for the fact that they are so big and their tube canisters aren't very well sized for storage I probably would have kept all of my Rahkshi. As it stands I chose the best one out of the bunch I liked the most and sold off the rest and I'm sure whoever owns them now is having a world of fun with them. The Rahkshi are highly recommended for all you Bionicle fans. And MOCing some better hands for them might enhance an already impressive model.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Nmfrey23","2021-12-25T05:04:44.217Z","The set that got me back into Bionicle","<p>When I was a kid, my first Lego set was Rahkshi STARS. Suffice to say, I was a bit late to the party, but I was immediately interested in the Bionicle series. It wasn&#39;t until much later that I learned that Bionicle had spanned 10 years, and that the STARS sets were all recreations of previous characters. After some digging, I found that there was not one, but a total of 6 other Rahkshi sets. I had always liked the rock/sand characters from &#39;09 and &#39;10, so, naturally, I chose to check out Panrahk. I was amazed by the finished result, since it wasn&#39;t like anything I had seen before, and holds up as a good set even today.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>.New lower leg, upper leg, foot, torso, and mask pieces.</p>

<p>.Part of the first wave of&nbsp;canister sets with knee joints and moveable heads</p>

<p>.Gear function swings his staff</p>

<p>.Blades of staff are new parts (fragmentation staff)</p>

<p>.Back and spiked spine are new parts</p>

<p>.The back pops open to reveal a Kraata (slug-like creature made of rubber) in brown &amp; tan</p>

<p>.Unique type of build</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>.Stubby arms coupled with the staff make arm movement a bit clunky</p>

<p>.Gear function can sometimes cause unwanted shoulder movement</p>

<p>.Somewhat top-heavy</p>

<p>.Back can open up unexpectedly</p>

<p>Overall, the Rahkshi were almost entirely new for their time, and Panrahk is no exception. If you want an innovative&nbsp;set with plenty of new parts and features, pick your favourite of the 6 Rahkshi to check out. 4/5</p>
