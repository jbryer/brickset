One of the sets of ice in mata nui, have well designed shapes, in the spine or in the blade of the staff. The kraata is included, assorted in the shape, a slug-like creature that is very cool. The feet are great too. This is a enemy of toa nuva, in the movie, the rahkshi have destroyed the island of mata nui, i think that they are very powerful, and the sets are one of the greatest.

It really looks neat, but anyway, this Rahkshi is a great buy and worth every cent.  His staff is cool, and his spine is unique from the others'.  There really isn't anything else special about him, other than playability, but he's still my favorite Rahkshi.  Pros and Cons:

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has some really good pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. The kraata we get in this set is rubbery.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8588-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head can be adjusted. If you push the head you can open the back where you can put a kraata in. On the back of the figure you'll also find a gear which makes the arms moving to the right and to the left. I really like the design of this figure and I also like Kurahk's staff.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

What did he represent again?","<p>Set #8588 Rahkshi Kurahk: The Rahkshi were a nice improvement to the Bohrok from the previous year of enemies, they all looked suitably menacing and impressed me with their lithe, wirey looking builds compared to the short blockier forms of the Bohrok. In my Bionicle world the Rahkshi were the Generals and the Bohrok merely the cannon fodder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another impressive thing about all Rahkshi figures was their large and imposing statures (Something the Bionicle Stars figure hasn't captured, but I like it for mainly different reasons anyway.) the Rahkshi towered over the Toa making them dangerous and cunning adversaries to battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also had an arm related gearing gimmick, but unlike the Toa which hindered the poseability this gimmick enhanced it slightly, giving them the ability to swing their weapons from side to side by turning a dial. Their weapons were also something of an impressive sight, built up with two ends and a long Technic rod (I think they're called) these weapons offered up a dangerous look to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like all Bionicle the Rahkshi can be stored in their canisters. What more can I say about this figure? It's a very nice and solid build with all pieces accounted for and a few clever useses of Technic parts to link up the legs without relying too heavily on the ball jointing. I would have to say that if you only have the Bionicle Stars version then you are doing yourself a disservice, I strongly recommend any Rahkshi to enhance and add power to the 'runt' of the liter that is Bionicle Stars Rahkshi. But don't just buy them all or buy willy nilly, pick a color you prefer the best out of the set and go with it. That's what I did, and I haven't been dissapointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if like me you prefer the white colors of the Bionicle figures then Rahkshi Kurahk is a definite buy.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
