"Gus_263","2008-02-09T14:24:24.34Z","Lerahk, another cool green bionicle","Like Lewa and Matau, the lehrak's green is also a good option to do creations. This rahkshi can have a staff of poison, but the spine looks like a thing of air. The colors, a gray, included with all rahkshi, and a so cool green. The staff of poison like very a poisoner weapon. The gear function have playability and fun. The kraata colors are awesome. It came assorted in shape, and in the pack in color and shape. The green scehme on the kraata looks like jungle colors. All kraata like a slug thing, very cool to play. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-04-02T18:37:40.81Z","Same as the Other Ones","The reason why Bionicle does well is that Lego copies ideas from that theme. The Rankshi sets look all the same but with different colors and slightly different features. I don't think this set is good at all and shows all Lego fans that you should stick to Lego bricks.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Good Colour Scheme
Stands up well
Kraata
Staff of Poison
Posable

Cons:
None

Overall, excellent addition to any collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-06-16T17:01:35.7Z","Awesome!","I've been a fan of Bionicles for a long time. This set made me more into them. Rahkshi Lerahk had cool looking end pieces to his staff. In general, I think it's neat that the  rahkshi can hold krataa in their backs. All the joints make this fun to play with. It's also fun to swing his arms and staff at enemies. This set has lots of cool details, so it's well worth it's price. If you get bored with it, use it's pieces and construct something new. It's fast and easy to build.

Enjoy! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-07T14:24:38.077Z","GO RAHKSHI!","I recieved Lerahk as a late birthday present in 2003. He is my favourite Rahkshi and I'm sure that's a shared opinion around here. The green Bionicles have a track record of being the best ones. (Matau, Matau Hordika, Ehlek, Orkahm.) Lerahk's staff ends are the coolest there are, and it's a good idea to have all the Rahksi because of the collectible kraata. (Which, by the way, can attach to the faces of Toa and Matoran just as well as the krana that come with the Bohrok and Bohrok-Kal.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-21T01:46:32.59Z","A poisonous foe!","Lerahk is my favourite Rahkshi, although my brother really hates him. After 5 or so years I still can't quite figure out why....

Pros:
- Staff
- Head
- Spikes
- Tall
- Build is awesome
- Turny mechanism
- Staff ends
- Colours

Cons:
- Maybe a bit too much grey

Overall Lerahk is a totally awesome Bionicle and is a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-03T17:29:09.253Z","Rahkshi of Poison?","<p>Set #8589 Rahkshi Lerahk: I think the film said that Lerahk was the one with the poisonous power, I'd have to watch it again to remind myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rahkshi as a set of six are just about some of the best looking early Bionicle sets LEGO thought up. The Bohrok were small and compact and the Rahkshi were long and lithe, they towered over the Toa and used their size and extremely long quarterstaves to do battle against the Toa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their arm gimmick was also a much better one, it didn't hinder the poseability of the arms too badly compared to the geared gimmick of the Toa/Toa Nuva. You can also get some pretty impressive looking poses out of these guys because of the way their legs are constructed. The green coloring of Lerahk is rather bold looking and a nice companion piece to Lewa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall the Rahkshi models are practically perfect, they introduced some new foot pieces, some interesting weapon pieces for the two bladed ends of their quarterstaves and they featured a new play mechanic. The writhing little wormy things... I can't quite recall their names at the moment. These were like the Bohrok's Krana, capable of replacing a Toa or Toa Nuva's mask and infecting them. I highly recommend these great models to all Bionicle collectors, the Bionicle Stars Rahkshi has it's good points, but that one is more akin to the smaller companion sets as opposed to these larger and much more impressive looking Rahkshi.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"tkettle9719","2011-12-21T08:27:32.487Z","Poor Onua. He's Dead...","<p>I always loved the Rahkshi sets, and none of them really disappoint. Here's what I have to say about Lerahk. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Clever use of transparent red hand joint brick. <br></li><li>Green is my favorite color, and this could be a nice jungle Rahkshi presentation. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This feels a bit colorless. <br></li><li>I also feel like the colors here are not well enough represented.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is a nice set, but it does feel like the designer hates a splash of color that I love in Bionicle. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
