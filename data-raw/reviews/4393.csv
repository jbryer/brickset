LEGO, it would get a higher rating.  This is a good set for Bionicle.  Can go into cool poses, and
is good for fighting.  Looks nice, although building it leaves much to be desired for.  Playability is
great for a while, then kind of dies down.  

Building: 3/10
Looks: 6/10
Playability:5/10
Overall: 5/10

Also, my comment(in the comments section) was a bit harsh.  I don’t hate Bionicle(or
OctopusV!) I just think it got a little tired out after time.  Would you believe I once was a HUGE
Bionicle fan?  I was!  I owned(and still own most of these) all the Toa, Turaga, Bohrok, Bohrok
Va, Toa Nuva, and Rahkshi.  I had the Exo-Toa, Boxor, some McDonald’s Matoran, Takanuva,
Jaller and Gukko, and three Bohrok-Kal.  I also had Nui-Rama.  And I still like the original
Bionicle, it’s just gone on too long with the same ideas.  2004 looks pretty cool though.  The new
Matoran look sweet from the front, but they are just limbs and a head clipped on to a central body
piece.  An added back would have been nice.  And the new Toa?  Nice.  See, Bionicle contradicts
itself too much, I think.  I always try to give it a chance, though, just like I do with most other
LEGO(I never bought Jack Stone or Galidor, so I don’t review saying how horrible they are,
though I’ve heard).  I just wish LEGO would spend as much time making good System sets like
OE as they do making Bionicle.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-06T13:23:19.747Z","My favorite rahkshi","This is my favorite rahkshi, it have a very cool staff, used years later on many sets. The moves with the complete staff are very playable. The legs are tall, the blue color is awesome, and the kraata is assorted with a good color effect. But, unfortunately i lost the Guurahk's kraata, now, i want the kraata pack. The spine make the rahkshi looks like a serpent creature, but it was never used more in other sets. If one set have it, i go to want it. Overall, Rahkshi Guurahk is awesome, with a lot of usable pieces, good colors, weapons and more. I rate 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-25T08:40:00.733Z","The Son of Makuta","This was my first Rahkshi, and is probably my second favorite.  It's pretty cool, and I like the way he can swing the staff with the gear on his back.  Other than that, there's not much more to say, except that he's fun to play with and to pose.  He loses a point, though, for me because when I got him at a garage sale, he didn't have his Kraata.  I had to replace it with my friends red kraata, and he still has it to the day.  I'm still keeping my eyes open for a blue Kraata, but I haven't found one yet.  Oh well.  ...Oops, getting a little distracted here, on to the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

Playability

Posability

Looks awesome on a shelf staring down on you

Swinging staff

Powers (storyline speaking)

Cons:

Mine has a red Kraata

So go get Guurahk.  That's all I have to say.  See you later! :D",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Colors
Looks great
Very posable
Staff
Cons:
A bit too floppy
Overall, Guurahk is awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's not that theyr'e bad guys, I'm cool with that, but it's just the way theyr'e built. They do have cool weapons. They looks very cool when you look at pictures of them. But when you get it it's just not the same. No, I would not recommend it.",FALSE,3,3,4,3,3

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Bionicle is concerend I feel that the Rahkshi is where LEGO really hit their stride with the models. Forget the combination aspect of these older sets, the individual models are indeed some of the best in the entire Bionicle theme. They may not have any of the new hand pieces, but they still look good and are great to pose and play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guurahk's coloring of blue on grey serves to give this Rahkshi a nice aesthethic, the choices for colors being all primary was a novel approach to the Bionicle and before that Throwbots/Slizer Themes. Kids really love bright colors and adult fans can get behind them too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hunched over look of these models doesn't detract from them either. And there is a lot of potential for MOCing here. I'm looking at the picture of this thing and I can just see all of the character and personality this figure has. As far as action figure model kits go this is what you should be aspiring for. There are only two real flaws with the Rahkshi which can easily be addressed by a bit of creative restructuring, they don't have elbow joints and they don't have hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that these models are a worthy addition to any Bionicle collection. And if you haven't already found and bought them or have been on the fence because you just aren't sure, well don't be. They are fun to build, fun to play with, fun to pose in interesting venues and even fun to take apart and rebuild into different looking models.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
