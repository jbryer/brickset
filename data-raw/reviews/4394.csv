"legozander","2006-12-19T15:34:11Z","Great!","Rahkshi Vorahk was my first Rahkshi and I loved him! I liked the way the Kraata goes in the back and still do. The rahkshi were all really similar to each other but i didnt mind that one bit. The head and silver spine were cool and useful for making custom models. As for the new posable legs they were just SO cool. (Leg poseability was new in 2003.)
The staff and weapons on the end of it were rather oddly shaped but that didnt matter because they were just cooooooooooool. (And MEGA useful.) Well I guess thats the end of my reiveiw so bye now! :)",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-29T15:34:37.25Z","The dark rahkshi","The black rahkshi is one of the coolest, he looks like a being of shadows, with the gray of makuta and the rahkshi features, is very cool. The staff is useful, a piece that link the two hands and two weapons one in each side, can be moved easily. The spine is different comparing to the other rahkshi. The kraata is included on his back. The legs are the same tall of the rahkshi, and this is one of the most important sets for the kaita(combination of three bionicle) on instructions. The gear systems are also included, and is easy play with it. His staff is of hunger, and this dark rahkshi have a 5/5 rate. He is also included in a little movie on the web, called rahkshi rock.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-03T20:45:16.717Z","Rahkshi Born of Makuta","<p>Set #8591 Rahkshi Vorahk: According to the film the Mask of Light the Rahkshi are the sons of Makuta. Very interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rahkshi Vorahk also breaks up the naming convention, of course Bohrok Nuhvok also broke up the naming convention. Vorahk's name begins with a V instead of an O and he is black, thus the Toa Onua/Onua Nuva must inevitably be his nemesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as models go I think I've said it before, but it deserves repeating, the Rahkshi are a step up and the first step towards the builds that led to the much later figures in the Bionicle line. Because they gave us the first fully functional knee joint. (At least in the smaller canister models.) The gimmick of the Rahkshi is also much better than the geared gimmick of the arms of the Toa and Toa Nuva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weapons of the Rahkshi were also impressive looking, although it would have been nicer if LEGO had thought to include certain pieces to merge the quarterstaff into one piece to be held in one hand or the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd recommend the Rahkshi to any Bionicle fans. They are a nice imposing looking creature and stand quite tall compared to the original Toa. They are also very good for making dynamic displays.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The gray-black color scheme works great here, as opposed to other Rahkshi. <br></li><li>-The little worm accessory inside the set is so cute and EVIL.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-This set loses in the functionality wars compared to the Bohrok. <br></li><li>-I don't really understand how this weapon symbolizes stone. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Like all sets I own, this is a good set, but it could always be better. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
