Another great Bionicle set, and one definitely worth picking up if you
can find it for a reasonable price. Turahk is quite evil-looking, but
suffers from a few more cons than I like to see in a Bionicle set.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building Experience:</span></p>
The build is reasonably hard, but still one you probably don't need the
instructions for. It's a rather unique build, as the legs and also the
spine/neck sections use some building techniques that weren't often, if
ever, seen before or after 2003.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span></p>
Turahk is basically the same as the other Rahkshi, the only difference
being the spine and speartips, as well as the color. Many people
complain about the ""cloned"" Bohrok and Rahkshi, but I don't think it's
even worth mentioning, as it has no effect on the overall rating of the
set. Another nice thing about Turahk is that it comes with a collectible Kraata of Fear, which is a creepy little grub-looking
animal that looks, if possible, more scary then the Rahkshi itself.<br>
Turahk's head also has a small hole in the top, right above the
translucent orange eye piece, which lets light through and makes the
eyes look like they're glowing, which is very cool.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span></p>
Turahk's playability is only fair, and it is better used for display,
in my opinion. The legs are rather spindly, and tend to move in
unwanted ways when playing. Another slight con is that the feet are a
bit too large for its body, and I think some slightly smaller, clawed
feet would have been better.<br>
Turahk also includes a nice little place to put the Kraata, as well as
a gear that swings the arms back and forth when you turn a tiny rod.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for Money:</span></p>
I can't say much about the price, as I got my Turahk for free, but I
feel that if you can find a brand-new Turahk for about $12.00, it's
money well-spent, even if you only use it for display or MOCing.<br>
<br>
I find it rather hard to sum up my mixed feelings for this set, but I
think it's a pretty cool-looking set for display, even if it lacks
playability, which is only part of the reason why you buy a Bionicle
set.<br>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-03T21:08:44.25Z","Flaming Rahkshi","<p>Set #8592 Rahkshi Turahk: My final Bionicle review or the last one at least until I pick up Bionicle Stars Gresh or any of the other Bionicle Sets on my wants list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turahk is a wonderful Bionicle Model, like all the Rahkshi he has extremely long legs, large new feet pieces, the weapon which is of course a Quarterstaff and the spiked back pieces. He includes the arm gimmick of all other Rahkshi and his colors match Toa Tahu/Tahu Nuva. Which to me means that he is the enemy of Tahu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What more is there to say? The Rahkshi that were introduced during the third year of Bionicle were some of the better models of the early Bionicle figures. They make for excellent play figures or display pieces. And they stand out on any shelf with their streamlined look compared to all the spiky villains of later years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that these models are must have figures in any Bionicle collection. I do wonder though why the Bionicle Stars Rahkshi uses a different foot piece considering that this foot piece would have probably made more sense for a Rahkshi. Giving them toes seems to be a bit, questionable, on LEGO's part.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"Capricorn","2012-10-23T22:23:54.2Z","Turahk: Rahkshi of Fear","<p>Rahkshi Turahk is a Bionicle Rahkshi of 2003 with 45 parts that was roughly 10$ when it appeared in stores. Turahk also makes an appearance in the first Bionicle movie. Not only does this Rahkshi have an exposed gear in its torso, but it can also (with some difficulty) be shoved back into its own canister similar to the Bohrok. A kraata can be placed in its shell, on the top of its body. The Rahkshi were the first generation of sets to have bending knee joints in Bionicle. This set is very nice and essential for any Bionicle collector.</p><p><br></p><h4>Building Experience</h4><p>Turahk has a short but fun build time. The body is rather straightforward when built, and the arms are extremely simple. The kraata shell is interesting, but it is somewhat challenging to place the kraata fixed inside the shell. The building of the legs is repetitive, but their bend-ability is worth it. The build is mostly pin-pushing so it can hurt your thumbs after a while.</p><p><br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Turahk has 45 parts. His body doesn't necessarily use any useful parts; most of the body pieces can only be applied if you wish to build other Rahkshi or Vahki. The shell on top can be used as armor, and the spikes are awkward to use in other creations. The staff and the feet are the only real parts that are not made obsolete by later Bionicle parts.</p><p>Despite its uselessness, the shell, spikes, head, staff, and legs all look great together. The spikes and staff just <i>look</i> fearsome. The legs are different than modern Bionicle legs. The lower legs are similar to as they are today, but the upper legs are made of 3 parts forming a socket-ball piece contrary to the recent socket-socket piece. All of the body parts put together are quite good-looking on any Rahkshi or Vahki, but not so much anything else. The kraata inside the shell is quite a nice piece, and you can only find them in Rahkshi sets. However, kraata cannot attach to Toa faces, so I would suggest collecting krana over kraata.<br></p><p><br></p><h4>Playability</h4><p>The major upside of Turahk, and likewise all Rahkshi, is its immense pose-ability. Since the knees can bend, you can give it an impression of crouching or jumping, making play much more in-depth. The gear system inside a Rahkshi's torso is rather more for looks than play it seems. With the properly sized bar between his hands, turning the stick on his back will make him swing his staff. However, the staff's range is limited and its pose-ability is not very high. The staff can hardly even go above the figures head because the arms are not long enough. It is tough to play with the staff so limited, so what you should do is detach one hand from its arm so the Rahkshi can swing the staff far and wide, making it look cooler and easier to play with. But by default, Turahk and his staff is comparable to a T-Rex holding a light post between its hands.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, Turahk is a fun build, with cool-looking but rather worthless MOC-wise parts, and a rather high playability factor. The build is quick but involves a lot of pin-pushing, the feet, shell, and kraata look awesome, and its obvious best feature is the bending knees. Turahk is a great addition to any Bionicle Collector, but I personally would not suggest it for parts or something to build.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
