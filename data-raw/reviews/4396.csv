He has three kraata storage things, a cool staff, and  his mask is great 'cause it can turn around to look cool in two ways!  Also, his hands are really masks, which is really cool.  It is a fun build, and the final product is dazzling!  It actually looks quite different than in that bad pic here!  He is really fun, since you can make his torso swing, and his legs bend so he can stand in different positions!  Contrary to what people say, you can build lots of different things with bioncle!  Also, this set has just as many pieces as all the &quot;normal&quot; lego sets this price!  Bionicle is great quality toys!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Makuta has three kraata holders (on his chest and leggs) but you have to buy the kraata seperately. He comes tith the mask of shadow, Kraahkan, whitch can turn allies against each other and fill the bravest bieings with fear. Kraahkan also has two poses, the short one and the tall one. I like the tall pose because the mouth is chowing whitch makes Makuta look more evil. Overall i rate Makuta 100 out of 100.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Vrahno","2013-07-02T14:29:56.993Z","He's the most evil BIONICLE character, but is his toy any good?","When <i>BIONICLE</i>'s  very own main baddie Makuta (or Teridax as he later came to be known) came out as a set, it was a big deal. It was the first official set representation of the character, and it created a classic and memorable appearance for him. Looking back over all the other ""titan"" sets that have come out since, it's difficult to give this one a fair critique. On one hand, Makuta is an impressive figure with an inventive built, but on the other, it comes off as crude and not as well thought out as it could have been.<br><p>At first, not many detractors are apparent. It's a nice design, radiating the sort of evil authority that befits the character. The color-scheme of gunmetal gray, black, red and silver lends the toy a dark and fierce aura, and the many large armor pieces and decorative elements make him look suitably ""beefy"" and dangerous. He is well-armored and looks solid, even though the three ""Rahkshi back"" pieces on his thighs and chest can really be opened up to store Kraata worms (which, according to the story, Makuta indeed pulls out of his own body).<br></p><p>Lending him uniqueness is his Mask of Shadows, which can be flipped around to show either a bestial, or a somewhat more traditional-looking face. Again, this is accurate to the story, where Makuta are shape-shifters. Depending on the head's configuration, he can have blue or red eyes. Besides his movable head, he also has long arms with actual elbows, making him one of the first <i>BIONICLE</i> sets<i> </i>to have these points of articulation. His hands are curiously made out of the Mask of Light piece, making them look more like spiky gloves than actual hands. With these, he holds a staff which, although looks simplistic and unspectacular now, was likewise a unique accessory back then.<br></p><p>As an early <i>BIONICLE</i> set, he has an action-feature, though a tad unimpressive one that I think works against the toy: he can swing his upper body from side to side, imitating an attack move. It's a gimmick that he shares with that year's smaller Matoran sets, though they could at least be made to play a match of Kohlii this way. On Makuta, this feature seems less fun, and its construction is the toy's biggest weakness. Not only does it make his middle part flimsy, it also looks bad, with all the unsightly connector pieces that mess up the figure's otherwise sleek visage. This and his awkward hip design leave large gaps in his abdomen.<br></p><p>The figure can't really be faulted for not utilizing the type of leg-design that became standard with later ""titans"". I can see why he has ratcheted instead of ball-jointed hips, as these are much more sturdy. But the hips are otherwise very frail, and the thin upper thighs are in contrast with the bulky legs. The legs don't have any articulation and are pre-bent by design, so Makuta can't pull off many poses. Straightening him up makes him look awkward and unbalanced, so the legs can really only be moved sideways. Even if his legs were poseable, the freely swinging upper body would ruin most poses anyway.<br></p><p>His shoulders also have an unfortunate design fault, as the Toa Nuva chest armor pieces greatly limit the movement of his arms. If you try moving them forward, they pop off the armor and the tiny piece holding it in place, and moving them to the side often scrapes off some of the armor's soft plastic. His head is also notoriously loose, coming off with a slight pull.</p><p>Together, these issues detract a lot from what could have been one of the most impressive <i>BIONICLE</i> sets. As it is, the figure <i>does</i> stand out among the earlier sets, but doesn't hold up as well compared to many later ""titans"". It's a bit of a letdown, though I wouldn't call it a bad toy, and even if the playability is limited, the toy works great as a display piece, as long as one covers up the annoyingly sloppily constructed abdomen assembly. However the biggest draw of the set may well be the awesome character that it represents.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,4

The new piece, (at the time) the Kanohi Kraahkan, the Mask of Shadows, was a nice addition, though in Mata Nui Online Game, he was a grey and green Matoran with a Hau.

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2021-02-26T11:40:03.443Z","The one true Makuta","<p>The Fall 2003 Bionicle storyline brought us what was <em>supposed</em> to be the final confrontation with the main villain, Makuta (Greg Farshtey negating that after he hijacked the story is one of the reasons I despise the man... but I digress). As part of that, Makuta was finally granted a set of his own and a true form to go with it. It was a Titan set for the year, and decently big and imposing and evil-looking.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>As a larger set, Makuta came in a cardboard box rather than a canister. The front features a large view of Makuta himself, on a rocky surface, in front of the Fall 2003 Bionicle background: The Kanohi Avohkii (Mask of Light) and Kanohi Kraahkan (Mask of Shadows) back to back, separated by a glowing white silhouette of the island of Mata Nui. And, behind this, <em>The Matrix</em>-esque random strings of Matoran numerals and script; these are more visible on the boxes. There&#39;s also a smaller cutaway pane of Makuta in a head-on view with somewhat less digital embellishment.</p>

<p>The back of the box features a view of the Makuta set being played with, cutaway panes showing the two-faced nature of the Kanohi Kraahkan, and cross-sells for the other larger sets from Fall 2003: 8594 Jaller and Gukko Bird, 8595 Takua and Pewku, and 8596 Takanuva; the cross-sells are accompanied by a picture of a here-unnamed combiner model that can be built with this set, 8594, and 8595. The combiner model was named &quot;Makuta Nui&quot; by a catalog, but other sources like the 2005 Maze of Shadows game - and I <em>want</em> to say a magazine or website from the same year as the sets - instead identify it as Graalok, the Ash Bear Takua and Jaller encounter in Le-Wahi in the <em>Mask of Light </em>movie. I favor the latter, since it gives an official form for Graalok and was never used by Makuta (and in general it feels more Rahi-like).</p>

<p>The top features a promotion for the second Mata Nui Online Game, one side features the same cross-sells as the back, one side just has a small picture of the set within, and the bottom merely features the barcode.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The instuction booklet, as per the norm, features a cut-down version of the main front image on the cover, and the standard late-2003 Bionicle back cover: a panel on the upper left advertising the website, a panel on the upper right advertising the Mask of Light movie, and a full-width panel advertising the 2003 Bionicle game (sadly a different game than the one advertised in 2001). The game being given more prominent billing than the movie seems an odd choice given the movie&#39;s greater importance. Inside are cross-sells for the other large sets, the Rahkshi (Makuta&#39;s self-spawned elite minions), and a chart of the Kraata (the slug/worm creatures that animate the Rahkshi).</p>

<p>As Makuta is a large Bionicle set, the instructions depict the parts with regular computer drawings (as standard Lego sets do) instead of the realistic renders used by the instructions for smaller Bionicle sets like Toa and Matoran at this time. The background of choice is a faint version of the back-to-back Avohkii and Kraahkan image. The instructions are fairly clear, it&#39;s easy to tell the difference between dark gray parts and black parts. However, they do unfortunately feature one of my pet peeves: Not telling you you&#39;re supposed to build 2 of an assembly (the legs, in this case) until the last step of the assembly, despite the instructions for that assembly spanning multiple pages. It&#39;s nowhere near as bad as the instances of that in 4483 AT-AT, but it&#39;s still a little irritating. No faults other than that, however.</p>

<p>There are also instructions for the first third of the Graalok/&quot;Makuta Nui&quot; combiner build, covering the</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As far as special/Bionicle-speciific parts go, there are three Rahkshi back cores, three Rahkshi backplates in red, three Rahkshi backs in metallic charcoal (officially called Pearl Dark Gray), one Rahkshi pelvis, one red Kolhii Matoran torso, four Bohrok head liftarms, four silver Bohrok eyes (AKA Technic teeth), two Rahkshi forelegs, two Rahkshi four Toa Nuva breastplates and two Toa Nuva paldrons in metallic charcoal, one Toa Mata/Turaga head in red, one transparent blue Toa/Turaga eyepiece, two flat silver Kanohi Avohkii pieces (to represnt clawed hands), two of the &quot;unfolded Chronicler&#39;s tool&quot; piece also used for Takanuva&#39;s Staff of Light blade in flat silver, three Pohatu Nuva climbing claws, and Makuta&#39;s own mask: Kanohi Kraahkan, the Mask of Shadows. Many have remarked on this mask not looking like the movie version. This is because Makuta&#39;s movie apperance is based on an early prototype of the set, with a mockup mask kitbashed from a Pakari Nuva and a Vahi. The Kraahkan seen in this set is the correct, finalized design. It&#39;s a unique mask with two different faces; the main one is demonic and somewhat bestial, and relies on the head being angled with the eyestalk parallel to the ground. In this configuration, the red of the head fills out the irises (althoug the effectiveness of this is partial). But there&#39;s also a second face of more ambiguous (in my opinion, at least) nature designed to make use of the traditional head orientation and the blue eyes. The Kraahkan comes in a few different batch variations, and there&#39;s also a so-called &quot;movie edition&quot; Kraahkan in the Takutanuva giftset that attempts to make the secondary face look like the beta Kraahkan seen in the movie (with perforce limited success, so it&#39;s fairly pointless in my opinion). Final notes on the Kraahkan: It&#39;s made of the same semi-soft plastic as Toa Nuva armor and weapons, and the Kanohi Avohkii. And just like the Avohkii, it attaches via an axle rather than a mere stud, firmly anchoring it; this signifies a shift away from the &quot;knock the mask off&quot; gimmick.<br />
<br />
As for more general Technic parts, there are plenty of Technic liftarms (most of them dark gray, but there are a few black and a few red), some red and dark gray Technic beams, two Technic ratcheted universal joints, assorted connectors, some red &quot;horseshoe&quot; balljoint sockets, cowl/snout pieces in metallic charcoal, one ribbed Technic hose, and of course several Technic axles and pins and bushings. Fall 2003 marks the point where Lego had begun to color-code Technic pins and axles (and changed some of the already-extant coding): odd-length axles are new light gray, axle-pins without friction ridges are now tan instead of light gray, and axle-pins with friction ridges are now blue. Even-length axles remain black; half-pins, 3/4 pins, ridgeles pins, and studded axles (none of which Makuta has) are similarly unchanged.<br />
I&#39;ve noticed that the light gray axles seem to have less friction than the black ones, despite seemingly being the same mold as when all regular axles were black. Not sure why. But this can cause issues as age wears on parts (if an axlehole has become loose over time, it could end up completely loose on a likewise-worn gray axle).</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build of Makuta is satisfiyingly complex, as one would hope for from a Technic set of this size. There&#39;s nothing to the build that&#39;s mind-bogglingly impressive, but there&#39;s also nothing particularly tedious, confusing, or painful; the only headache is the one mentioned in the instructions section. Perhaps the most innovative element is the way the head is set up to make use of the mask&#39;s two faces. There are a few cases where axles are left protruding by a half-width at points, an obvious sign of them being selected for double-duty in alternate builds.<br />
You start by building up the pelvis, which is based around the Rahkshi pelvis piece with the Matoran torso and the sockets for the ratchet joints mounted to it. From there, you progress to building up the middle of the upper torso onto the Matoran torso. After that, you build and attach the legs (which are identical). Then, you build up the shoulders and complete the back. With the shoulders complete, you can build the arms (which are identical at their core). With the body almost entirely complete, you then build up the massive two-bladed staff. After connecting the staff to his hands, you complete the hands by attaching the two silver Avohkii and popping the Kraahkan onto his head.</p>

<p>The build of the first third of the Graalok/&quot;Makuta Nui&quot; combiner model is similarly satisfying and complex, perhaps a bit more complex than the main Makuta build. It begins with what will become the creature&#39;s waist, built up using Technic beams. You immediately have to use parts from both this set and 8595 Takua and Pewku, and you&#39;ll be using parts from 8594 Jaller and Gukko Bird by step three. The shoulders are built around aRahkshi pelvis and back core and the red Matoran torso, and attached using perpendicular axle-and-pin connectors and the Bohrok head liftarms. After this torso is mostly finished, you shift to building most of one leg. This is somewhat similar to building one of Makuta&#39;s legs, but it makes use of regular beams and liftarms.<br />
Notably, this build does not require any parts from Takua and Jaller themselves.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>Completed, Makuta cuts an imposing figure (as well he should). He stands at around ten inches tall,.and wields a long, hefty twin-bladed staff. The staff is swung by turning the connector on his back that acts as a handle, making him pivot at the waist. As an additional play feature, he has three Kraata compartments - fitting, since he spawns Kraata from his own substance. He has elbow, shoulder (somewhat limited by the armor, but not horribly so), and wrist articulation, making him one of the most articulated Bionicle figures of the time as far as arms are concerned. His legs have ratcheted rotation and bending at the hip. It&#39;s not super-great, but it isn&#39;t useless either.<br />
In the primary orientation, the Mask of Shadows looks suitably menacing and malicious; when oriented like a normal mask it gives him a more ambiguous look. The mainly black, gray, and metallic charcoal color scheme is quite suitable for a shadow-themed character, far better than the &quot;tainted red&quot; the movie changed it to.</p>

<p>Overall, Makuta is a very satisfying package. Later Titan sets may have been more articulated, but his own articulation was hardly horrible especially by the standards of the first three years. A waist swivel may be a simple gear gimmick for such a large figure, but it&#39;s a very effective one when taken in conjunction with his massive Staff of Shadows. The Kraata play feature is cool, and integrates perfectly with the lore. And he definitely delivers on aesthetics, bulk, and presence. Plus there&#39;s all the fun of alternate builds. About the only knock is that the neck axle can slip out of the rock</p>

<p>I&#39;d say he&#39;s still very much worth getting even today, at least if you can find him for a good price.</p>

<p>A word of warning, however: Don&#39;t leave him assembled for overly-long periods of time. It can cause stress on some of the parts, especially the straight axle connectors and the #7-08 perpendicular axle-and-pin connectors; some of the latter on mine are actually cracked from the stress caused by my making that very mistake, and I had to reinforce them with super glue.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-02T06:19:05.27Z","The bad guy","<p>For those who don&#39;t know too much about Bionicle as a series, Makuta was&nbsp;the overarching villain during all 10 years of the series. He goes by many names: Makuta, Terridax, evil incarnate, but how is his set representation? Well, it&#39;s a unique titan build, and to my knowledge, was the first large build to represent a humanoid character rather than a mech or animal. Due to this, the set still has some issues since the build used was a first for Bionicle, but the building experience, and the overall look of the set is well worth checking out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Arguably wears one of the best-looking masks in Bionicle as a whole</p>

<p>3 joints in the arms (uncommon in &#39;03)</p>

<p>VERY solid build with almost no gaps in the armour. Looks amazing as a finished product.</p>

<p>Gear function allows arms and torso to move.</p>

<p>Unique leg build with feet reminiscent of boots.</p>

<p>Unique torso build.</p>

<p>2 masks of light in silver.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arms are (by comparison) a lot thinner than the rest of the build.</p>

<p>The Toa Nuva chest plates used on the shoulders can pop off if arms are positioned too high.</p>

<p>Torso can swivel from side to side when posing.</p>

<p>Legs have no ball joints. They use technic friction joints instead.</p>

<p>Head attachment is loose.</p>

<p>Overall, this early titan set is far more visually striking than the picture might suggest, and includes a lot of new pieces. I almost got the set for the mask alone, but I soon found that the rest of the set is well worth it too. 4/5</p>
