The Matoran Jaller is like all the other matoran of 2003, with some good colors, considerable size but no much good playability. This set also includes the mask hau and a kohlii stick. The Gukko is a large rahi with awesome color combination but no much playability or design. The pecker of the bird is made with a sword, that not likes much a pecker. The four wings are also cool but no much playable. The set is great, but no in playability, and due to this i rate 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Indian4561","2009-07-31T17:41:47.107Z","Jaller Rules!","            Ok, Jaller is my favorite Bionicle ever!I got him at a yard sale along with a pound of 2001-2003 bionicles for 10$! Now on to the review...
            

            Jaller: In the '03 Matoran build, Jaller is pretty good. He has a yellow kanohi hau (awesome!) and a staff and ball so he can play kolhii with his friends. I only have him though. If you turn the knob on his back, his body will turn with it so he can hit the little ball, which can be fitted into his staff for transport. My favorite figure ever, until i get Lhikan... 6/5

            Gukko Bird: Apparently the main model, Gukko is accualy very easy to build! In the Movie, Mask of light, Gukko carries Jaller and Takua up a mountain from Le-koro to Ko-Koro, but then  crashes. As a model, it can carry both matoran(Takua sold seperatly). It also has a handle so you can carry it and a second handle that allows you to flap the wings, both acsessable at the same time with one hand! Overall, 4/5

           Overall if you can find it cheap, don't hesitate. GET IT!

Unquote: but anyway lets get down to&nbsp;business. okay, so jaller as a matoran... Wow lego really? REALLY!? anyway, that wasn't the best idea of there's but i guess they didn't think of making him bigger did they? well, they didn't even have the inika bodies then, did they? but truthfully i rather like the bird... it's kinda cute ain't it? but also, if you buy this set with takua and pewku and all the matoran of 2003, as well as takanuva and makuta AND all of the toa nuva AND the rahkshi AND all of the turaga AND a LOT more custom made matoran, it would be fun to play out the movie ""LEGO BIONICLE Mask Of Light"" but you'd&nbsp;probably have to find a LOT of people to do that and also have a LOT of money cause' it's 2011-2012-(maybe)-2013 when your reading this so if you can find a good price on amazon to buy all that than your really amazing... enough chit-chat i have to get to bed soon so here's the pros-cons.&nbsp;</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2021-03-01T04:13:45.36Z","From Hawk to Hummingbird","<p>This is one of four larger sets from the Mask of Light storyline, featuring Jaller and the Gukko bird he and Takua rode to travel from Le-Wahi to Ko-Wahi.</p>

<p>The original &quot;Big, ridable bird&quot; of Bionicle was a hawklike bird called the Kahu, which appeared in set form as the alternate build of 8548 Nui-Jaga. There was also a somewhat smaller, vulture-like bird alternately called both the Kewa and the Goko-Kahu, one of the possible builds of 10023 Bionicle Master Builder Set (there was also a third bird, the much smaller parrotlike Taku, but it&#39;s not as relevant to this discussion).<br />
However, both these birds&#39; names were among those that had to be changed as a result of the Maori lawsuit against Lego over cultural appropriation; both names were replaced by &quot;Gukko.&quot; In this case, Lego actually went beyond just changing the names, seeming to overwrite the designs with the X-wing hummingbird creature featured in this set (in <em>Mask of Light</em>, Takua refers back to his adventures from the Mata Nui Online Game by saying he&#39;s been the second in a Gukko rider team before; as originally depicted in the game, this was aboard the hawklike Kahu). The old designs were eventually recanonized by Greg Farshtey as subspecies of Gukko bird, but in a problematic way: he brought back the appropriated names as well. Taking that fact together with Kualus&#39; line about &quot;Gukko&quot; possibly being an insult in the birds&#39; language, it seems like Farshtey took that particular change with ill grace (another sign of his unsuitability, in my opinion).</p>

<p>The other star of the set is also a subject of the lawsuit-induced changes; when initially released as a McDonald&#39;s Happy Meal toy (set #1391), the character was called &quot;Jala,&quot; but after the suit his name was changed to Jaller. Not that anyone forwarded the updated name to Henry Gilroy - in Mask of Light, absolutely everyone pronounces his name as if it was still &quot;Jala.&quot; I believe the subtitles and the script even spell it as such. This would be a good time to note that Lego did not handle the name changes in the best way when it came to character names; they presented it as in-universe renaming, but under the circumstances it would have been better to just externally retcon them as they did with creature names and terminology. Anyway, Jaller himself has certainly grown since his original McDonald&#39;s set, with more articulation and his own gear gimmick.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>Smaller Bionicle sets tended to come in canisters, but larger sets like 8594 Jaller and Gukko Bird came in a box. The front depicts Jaller and the Gukko in flight, in front of the standard Fall 2003 Bionicle background: The Kanohi Avohkii (Mask of Light) and Kanohi Kraahkan (Mask of Shadows) back to back, separated by a glowing white silhouette of the island of Mata Nui. And, behind this, <em>The Matrix</em>-esque random strings of Matoran numerals and script can be seen. Further visual interest comes from a small cutaway pane showing a side view of the set.</p>

<p>One side of the box simply features standard toy warnings, a smaller version of the front picture, and the Lego logo. The other side features cross-sells for 8593 Makuta, 8595 Takua and Pewku, and 8596 Takanuva. The top features advertisement for the Bionicle website and the second Mata Nui Online Game. The bottom has the barcode, and little else.</p>

<p>The back of the box features a view of the bird being held, with someone operating the trigger for the wings, a side view of Jaller with his back knob being turned, and a small overhead view of the bird. There are also the same cross-sells as the side, with the addition of a picture showing that this set can be combined with 8593 and 8595 to build a here-unnamed larger model. Catalogs identified this as &quot;Makuta Nui,&quot; but other sources such as the Maze of Shadows game instead identify it as Graalok the Ash-Bear (a creature encountered by Takua and Jaller in the jungles of Le-Wahi during the events of the movie). I personally favor the latter.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The instruction manual features a smaller version of the main front image on the front cover (as is standard), and the back bears promotions for the Bionicle website, the <em>Mask of Light</em> movie, and the Bionicle game released for PC, Xbox, PS2, and GameCube; oddly, the non-canon game is given greater prominence than the movie. Inside at the back are advertisements for the Rahkshi, the other Fall 2003 boxed sets, and a chart of the Kraata (the Makuta-spawned slugs/worms responsible for infecting masks).</p>

<p>The instructions proper have a lighter, more printer-friendly version of the back-to-back Avohkii and Kraahkan image as the background. Where the instructions for smaller Bionicle sets from this era used realistic CGI renders to depict the parts, these just use the same digital drawing style as standard Lego sets. There are actually two sets of instructions present: one for the actual set, and the other being the second third of the Graalok/&quot;Makuta Nui&quot; instructions. Both sets are fairly clear - no confusing angles, ambiguous placements, or any other such issues to complain about.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The standard Technic parts for this set include beams, liftarms, &quot;horseshoe&quot; ball-joint receivers, some towball pins, some cowl/snout pieces, a 12-tooth double-beveled gear, two different rubber bands, a few different connectors, and of course the usual assortment of axles, bushes, and pins; some of the beams are in flat silver, a bit rare for such parts. Fall 2003 marks the second stage of color-coding for Technic axles and pins, where axles of odd-numbered lengths became light gray, axle-pins with friction ridges became blue, and axle-pins with no ridges became tan; the light gray axles for some reason have slightly less friction than the black ones even when brand new, so that&#39;s something to watch out for as they wear as a potential source of trouble (I actually had to switch which 3L axle I was using for what at one point in the build because another part refused to grip it). As for the special/Bionicle parts, there&#39;s four of Lewa Nuva&#39;s Air Katana in dark orange, Kopaka&#39;s Sword in regular orange, two red Bohrok limbs, a quartet of Rahkshi lower legs in gray, a dark gray Rahkshi backplate and back core, a silver Rahkshi back core, a red geared torso, a red back/pelvis piece unique to the 2003 Matoran, a gray Matoran head, a flat silver Kolhii stick and ball/puck, two yellow Matoran feet, and a yellow Kanohi Hau (the Mask of Shielding, appropriate for the Captain of the Guard). Finally, there are two transparent red System studs that act as the eyes.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build starts with assembling Jaller, and is identical to building any other 2003 Matoran. You snap a tan axle-pin and two black 2L pins into the back/pelvis piece, pop on the torso and hook up the gear, assemble and connect the legs, insert the blue axle-pin into the neck and two 2L axles into the outer sockets of the torso, assemble and attach the arms (which use the Bohrok limbs), pop on the head, snap the ball into the Kolhii stick and fit it in his hands, and attach the mask.</p>

<p>With Jaller built, you start on the Gukko bird. This starts with building the body/tail of the bird, which is mostly comprised of liftarms. The first rubber band soon comes into play here, being used to hold the assembly that will act as a flight handle against the body when not in use. Another notable subassembly is a frame capped with #1 axle-and-pin connectors with tan axle-pins set in them; this acts as seating for Matoran on the fully-assembled model. Once the body is completed, you progress to the head, which uses the orange Kopaka sword as a lengthy beak; when complete, the head connects to the ball joint on the end of the Rahkshi backplate used at the front of the body. The final stage of the build is the wings. These start by attaching two of the Rahkshi lower legs to a long Technic beam and then attaching the dark orange air katana that act as the main wing plumage to them. A matching assembly that goes over this for the other wings is built using smaller, half-thickness beams and both are attached to the body via a carriage made mainly of thin liftarms (and a single thick liftarm that acts as a trigger). The other, larger rubber band is used here to power the flapping mechanism. Overall enjoyable, but nothing super-exciting.</p>

<p>In the second third of the Graalok/&quot;Makuta Nui&quot; build, you finish the leg begun in the first third by connecting one of the ratchet joint assemblies from Makuta to it with thin liftarms, and then attach it to the torso on the left side of the waist. After that, you build its symmetrical twin for the right-hand side and then attach that as well. The legs make use of the silver Rahkshi back covers from this set and from Pewku. Once the legs are done, you then build the jaw. The jaw makes use of the smaller rubber band from this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Jaller in complete form is fairly straightforward. He has a much greater range of motion in his arms than the 2001 McDonald&#39;s version did, although the arm-to-body ratio is essentially the same. He has hip articulation thanks to clever use of Technic L-shaped 3-pinhold connectors, and a gear gimmick that turns him at the waist to swing his Kolhii stick or anything else he might be holding. With this, he has a greater chance of knocking the mask of an infected Rahi (or similar opponent). Hitting the Kolhii ball with the stick can be a bit tricky, especially if it&#39;s on the flat side like a puck instead of the rounded side where it can roll, but it&#39;s still doable.</p>

<p>The Gukko bird is fairly solid as far as Technic creatures go. It looks good and is well-proportioned, and resembles a technorganic hummingbird with four wings in an X configuration. There are two rubber band-powered elements to it: a handle to hold it and fly it around with, and a black trigger that makes the wings beat. Two pairs of tan axle-pins allow one to securely seat two 2003 Matoran on it (while still leaving them easy to remove when you want). The flapping gimmick works quite well, very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Overall, I would highly recommend this set. Jaller is an important character and this set provides his Matoran self in a superior form, and the Gukko bird (who by the way is named Ka) is a cool animal in its own right. And both are quite fun to play with. But do try to avoid paying an excessive amount. If you don&#39;t have the physical manual I also recommend looking at the official instructions PDF linked here on Brickset instead of, say, Letsbuilditagain. This is because the images of the metallic parts darken when scanned, and it&#39;s possible to make mistakes like using the long dark gray beam early in the build as a result.</p>

<p>Final note: Don&#39;t leave it assembled for overly-long periods. This stresses the parts, especially certain connectors. And it&#39;s not very good for the rubber bands, either.</p>
