"legozander","2006-08-01T06:12:52Z","One of my best bionicles","I got this as a late christmas present in the post and i must say it is superb.Takua is cool and pewku is brilliant! My fav thing about pewku is the moving legs which are worked by a mecanisim using wheels underneath.You get peices in rare coulours too plus you get two ball joints. (i find ball joints very handy!)Pewku is the best part of the set everthing seems to be good about her. Takua is good as well but trouble is he has no eyes.(dunno why though.)Overall takua and pewku are well worth your money. get them if you want them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

As you can probably see Pewku is the focus of this set. I got this set for pewku (i hate bionicle!) because he moved and so did his cool colored claws! super good if your a fan of bionicle, okay for pieces if its not something you would buy!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Vrahno","2010-11-27T16:23:32.84Z","A Complex, if Fragile Critter","<p>A unique set. Released as a tie-in product for the first BIONICLE movie, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mask of Light</span>, it comes with the movie's main character, Takua the Chronicler and his trusty crab-steed, Pewku. Both of these characters have appeared before the movie in various games and animations, but this set marked the first time that they received actual figures. And both of them went through complete, radical redesigns to resemble their movie counterparts better.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Takua:</span></p><p>The rider, Takua, is a standard Matoran model, using the '03 body template. Much larger and much more articulated than the original Matoran design that came with McDonald's meals back in '01, but besides the colors, it is a regular build that you will be familiar with if you have any of the other Matoran sets from that era.</p><p>The ball-jointed arms and swiveling legs allow for a satisfactory range of articulation, save for the head, which, due to its strange side-appendages, cannot turn. However the waist-swinging gimmick makes up for it -- by twisting the knob on his back, his upper body swings from side to side. This in turn allows him to play the sport of kohlii. He comes with a kohlii stick and a puck, and although it can be tricky to hit it hard and accurately enough, the game is playable.</p><p>What makes Takua stand out from the rest of the Matoran is his color scheme. A striking red body with blue legs and hands, and a bright blue mask. But other than this, he is just a generic, '03-styled villager.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pewku:</span></p><p>The main focus of the set, without a doubt. Pewku is a female Ussal crab, a huge but friendly animal, who has been previously seen as a very small, blue and yellow colored being, and had no set. In this model, however, she became huge, adopted a brown and gray/silver color scheme, and got a very unique function which hasn't been seen in any other BIONICLE set.</p><p>Her design was clearly based on his animation model from the movie. Since her huge armor plates couldn't be made using standard pieces, the designers imitated her shell with a number of tubes, that run along her body. A standard procedure for Technic-style LEGO models, although it does leave her very hollow and full of empty areas. The inner rubber beams also tend to flop around, and there is no way to peg them down. Then again, they can become handy in keeping the rider on the model's back.<br></p><p>Pewku's gimmick is an interesting one. By pushing her along the floor, the wheels on her stomach activate a complex beam-system, which moves her crab-legs and imitates the way the animal would crawl. It works really well and produces an amazing effect, thanks to the way the legs are linked. They even slightly bump into each other, producing a satisfying, crawling noise. The down-part of this function is its delicacy. If you don't handle it carefully, the whole system is prone to falling apart frustratingly easily.</p><p>Besides this, I wouldn't call the model's other parts outstanding. Her body, as stated, is just a bunch of tubes and beams, with the only other relatively complex part being the face. The designers nailed her movie appearance as best as they could, though I wish that Rahkshi plate that serves as her forehead could have been connected to her body better. It stays in place normally, but it tends to flop forward if you turn the model upside-down. Another gripe is that her claws appear to be very small compared to the rest of her body. Maybe they could have given her bigger, actually functioning claws. At least her arms are individually posable, though they only have two joints each. Her only other articulation points are her eye-stalks. Even though they can only be moved at the base, they still give the model an expressive ""face"".<br></p><p>But its crawling gimmick and its involved (if somewhat repetitive) build more than make up for its shortcomings, for me at least. The set is also a good pack of pieces, and comes with a number of brown or dark-orange colored tubes and Bohrok eyes, which could be very useful for MOCists.</p><p>And of course the model has pegs for the rider to sit on it, as well as two other pegs farther back for another Matoran. This lets us reenact scenes from the movie, although the position of the riders had to be compromised, due to the way the animal's main body had to be designed (meaning they cannot sit next to each other, like in the movie).<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall:</span></p><p>Takua &amp; Pewku, while definitely not the best models, offer a very unique pairing, one that old-school BIONICLE fans can surely appreciate. While Takua is nothing to write home about, he at least got a figure for himself, and Pewku, although a bit flawed and perhaps a bit too easy to break apart, offers an interesting build and an intriguing function. It is surprising in its simplicity, yet manages to pull off a realistic crawling effect quite well.</p><p>The hollowness and fragility of the model aren't to everyone's liking, and I have seen many people hating it for these reasons, but to me, it remains a charming set with a cute-looking animal and a figure whose importance in the BIONICLE storyline cannot be questioned. For these reasons, I give it a 4/5. Because honestly, it is far from perfect, and it could even deserve a score of 3, but its charm and originality keep me from rating it lower.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Gus_263","2008-02-27T17:35:53.327Z","The Chronicler of the island of Mata Nui","This set includes the new form of Takua and Pewku, the ussal crab. I think that Takua, like all the other 2003 matoran is not much playable, but have a considerable size and awesome color combination. Takua also includes the mask Pakari and a Kolhii stick. Pewku is a ussal crab, and different to the gukko with jaller, pewku represents very well a crab. Pewku is also not much playable, but is fun and is good builted, with an great color scheme. I rate so, Takua and Pewku 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
