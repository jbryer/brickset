"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T11:25:44Z","He's okay, I guess","Takanuva--He was cool. Still follows the same design as the Nuva, which decreases his rating a bit, but I did like the golden armor and mask. He has a staff too, every character in the Rahkshi saga had that... what's up wit dat? What's the Clear Avohkii do, too? Is it a promo? Whatever it does, I liked it!

Ussanui--It was confusing. It made me get seriously peeved, and I wound up with the wrong size plus rod, so now it has a stick coming out of its front. A tip--never build near a couch. I lost one of the Rahkshi backs in there, and we had to lift the couch to get it back. Very, very annoying.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The weapon was used very in som sets. The kanohi in this color only is found in this set. The ussanui(his vehicle)is very cool, like very a vehicle, including a mask, and some blades and rahksi bodies. The front hace claws and systems.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-11T12:48:31.59Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Warriors) - Takanuva Review","<p>This is a good set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 76 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 200 pieces and it was 30 USD. The price per piece ratio is 15 cents per piece which may be a little bit high but if you want to get it for the mask of light I think it's worth the money.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8596-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>This set comes with a very nice looking speeder bike and a very nice Toa Takanuva figure. The only problems which I have with this set is that it is very hard to get Takanuva on the speeder. Another problem is that he doesn't have so many golden pieces just like in the movie. But the figure looks still very nice. The armor and the mask have some very cool gold pieces and if you move the gear on the back you can move the arm up and/or down. The legs, the feet, the other arm and both hands can be adjusted, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"TBOC","2010-01-30T14:14:24.983Z","Memories","Ah, the year was 2003. I saved up money to buy Takanuva & Ussanui, and Makuta Teridax. I was five, and built everything in a flash. Not hard at all.

Takanuva (figure):

Pros:

Kanohi Avohkii
Kohlii Staff of Light (Had new staff part)
Golden Nuva armor
Toa Nuva/Toa Mata design.
Gali Nuva limbs in white.
White face with TrPeach eyes.
Sparkly Avohkii.

Cons:

Easy to build
Not to many new pieces, only two.
Only 1 recolor. Gali limbs

Ussanui:

Pros:

Great build
Design
Piping is fablous
Nice usage of older parts (Kohrak-Kal Sonic shields, Lewa Nuva's Air Katana...)
Gray Kanohi Hau (Lhikan's Hau, In posstion of Jaller, Gray because of Unuseage, since it is a Noble Hau, in the shape of a Great Hau)
Climbing Claws
Rubber bands
Six Rahkshi Backs (I'm glad they used six, since there were Six active Rahkshi on Mata-Nui at the time.

Cons:

Would have liked it to have a Kraata or Six, since a Kraata was used to lead the Ussanui into Mangaia.
Would have liked it to have a compartment for a Matoran (Hahli) since she his in the Ussanui.

I'd say the Pros outweight the cons. So if you ever happen to come across one online, or somewhere else. Get it, you will want it.

Goes well with the Makuta Teridax set, and the Rebuilt Jaller, and Takua, if you want a transformation scene. Also goes well with Rahkshi sets and Toa Nuva.

"Matroxide","2012-06-15T14:04:00.95Z","Takanuva Toa of Light","<p>Armed with a Kohlii Staff of Light and the Kanohi Avohkii, Takanuva is ready to awaken the Great Spirit. His Ussanui, composed of deceased&nbsp;Rahkshi parts and Jaller's&nbsp;great Kanohi Hau, is ready to transport the seventh toa to Mangaia, the Makuta's lair. I realy enjoyed building&nbsp;the set but some parts of the building instructions were complicated. I do not recomend taking it apart, dumping the pieces in random bins, and mixing them in while searching for other&nbsp;parts,&nbsp;You will never find the missing&nbsp;Ussanui parts again, trust me. Other than that, it was a realy fun set in itself, but if you are craving more action for the Toa of Light, Makuta enhances the experience. There are plenty of great peices including&nbsp;a dark&nbsp;grey Kanohi Hau, a clear Kanohi Avohkii, silver Rahkshi spines, and Takanuva himself! The price was reasonable as all the bricks are either from a set before, or&nbsp;exclusive to Takanuva sets. What made the set fun was both the Mask of Light Movie, and the fact I am a Bionicle Nerd.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Capricorn","2012-12-16T22:20:51.87Z","Takanuva, Toa of Light! Oh yeah, and the Ussanui.","<p>This set contains Takanuva, the Toa of Light and transformed Takua. Of course, he plays a major role in the first Bionicle movie. This set also comes with the Ussanui, Takanuva's rather nice vehicle that he used to ride to Makuta's lair. The set had 200 peices exactly, but unfortunately cost 30$ when it was released, leaded to a rather poor part-price ratio, but it doesn't matter to me because I got it as a gift when I was like five. Of course, when I got it I was super happy with it... but thats because its an excellent set!<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts that come in this set are quite nice. There are six kraata holders for the Ussanui, that you can use on Rahkshi MOC's (my own creation). Theres six of them and you can load whem with kraata so it actually looks like it was made out of the Rahkshi (which it was). Theres also three Lewa Nuva air saber blade thingies, which are good being air saber blade thingies. There are two silver Bohrok feet, and a special silver Gahlok shield! There are also two Kohrak Kal shields that look quite good as engines. And don't forget the two Pohatu Nuva Claws in the front. But the pipes are also quite awesome, and if you blow through one it makes a deafening whistle. There are also several great technic parts for MOCs that are extremely useful. Oh yeah, and a rubber band! But the crowned jewels of this set are probably the masks of light... both a golden one, and a freaking amazing glitterish clear one! Don't forget the gray Hau at the front that can be replaced with Jaller's yellow one, as seen in the Movie.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is of decent length. First you build Takanuva, who is basically a white and gold Toa Nuva and thus falls to their average downsides. He is built the same too. The Ussanui is most of the set. You spend a while pushing in pins and placing kraata holders. Over the time you build you get to witness an amazing mechanism come into place... the landing-gear. The pipes can be a pain to secure on the vehicle though. The build is rather challenging for younger audiences, but that is what potentially makes it enjoyable.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a perfect example of the works of art Lego produced as titans from 2001 to 2004. They had <i>incredible</i> mechanisms. This one... has TWO! A gear on Takanuva's back can be used to swing his right arm, the one that should hold his staff of light. But the great mechanism is the lever on the front-right of the Ussanui, a red switch that when flicked down instantly retracts the landing gear, and when flipped up instantly deploys it.</p>Takanuva:<br>Takanuva is just another average Toa Nuva, with a single staff, but who he is makes up for his lack of poseability. He lacks bending knees, or bending arms. He does have free-moving arms though, since only his right arm is gear-bound. Like all Toa Nuva his legs can only move foward like 10 degrees but can expand outward like 80. His hands have little rods stuck in the end that he can use to climb onto and drive the Ussanui. His head is static and not adjustable at all. To get on the vehicle you have to specifically take it off and readjust it a certain way. A really cool feature of the figure is the ability to store his staff of light on his back so that it has a place to stay when he climbs onto his ship. The color scheme is also incredible... It may be mostly white, but the golden armor makes it great. Takanuva is not so great alone, but with his marvelous ship it does become something.<br><br>Ussanui:<br>The Ussanui is probably the best part of this set. As mentioned before, the mechanism to deploy or retract the landing gear is great functioning and a nice little touch. The pipes and such that run around the length of the ship are also good-looking, and the six kraata holders make it feel like an 03 titan. However, the color scheme does not quite match Takanuva, but it does a great job as it is. It is made of mostly silver armor and some gray bars and supports. However, logically there is no way for this thing to fly, since there are no engines... or wings... or really controls... but its possible to suspend the disbelief for long enough to play with and enjoy the set. However, even though the landing gear mechanism is terrific the gear can support the whole ship, but only if you use the three air saber thingies and not any other type of blades. When it is retracted though, the sabers make a great look at the rear as they curve up slightly over the back end. The only major downsides of this great vehicle are, I gotta say, the fact that the front is slightly heavier than the back (again inhibiting its realistic ability to fly) and how that the lever is a bright, obnoxious red color and the rubber band and switch are exposed. However, the gears under the landing blades are well hidden enough and can be taken as mechanics of the ship itself. Of course, due to the gears used it has to be lopsided but its nothing major. The only other real downside to anyone dumb enough to do it is turning the landing gear blades (particularly the back one) in the wrong direction. You got some broken parts leading your way buddy.<br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I gotta say that this is an excellent titan from the early days of Bionicle. The parts are fantastic and the build is challenging and decently-lengthy, and the completed model is something to behold. It is quite fun to play with as well, even despite Takanuva's dissapointing lack of poseability. This has got to be one of the best titans of all Bionicle due to the great gear system and looks, so if you can find it at a cheap and reasonable price be sure to pick it up, because you WON'T regret it!<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,3
