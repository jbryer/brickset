Finally managed to get one at a fair price and was very disappointed. Lots of good parts, put together in some form which uses all the necessary bits from 6880 and 6929. Very weak structure, no evidence of design and heaven only knows what the big white fridge with the arm is supposed to be!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

.... and thank my lucky stars I did...becuse this set is an absolute shocker.

I find none of the three major components overly appealing to the eye and the colour cordination of the parts is average to say the least.  The plane is badly designed and I cannot stand that big radar/gun on the front of the plane. The component that holds the rocket can easily tumble and is also poorly designed.

This is my books is a very slapstick approach to creating a classic space set and I am dissapointed that this one is even on the record.

In this case, I can see why.","As with the more recent 1968, this has a nice supply of useful pieces but fails to be greater than the sum of its parts.  The idea here seems to have been to build a set using the pieces from two smaller sets.  The problem was that they decided to use ALL the pieces, so a lot of the bits just look like they don't belong.  The main ship is fairly good, if a bit skimpy, but when attached to the (hideous) buggy it just looks ridiculous.  I'm not quite sure what that white 'structure' is.  Since this set was given away with Percil, maybe it's a space-age washing machine.  Like I said, a nice selection of parts, but you'd be better off making them into the two sets they came from.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - It uses ALL (100%) of the parts from 2 sets<br></li><li>Pro 2 - It came FREE with Persil products (what a deal)<br></li><li>Pro 3 - It is rare and different<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - It is ugly<br></li><li>Con 2 - The construction is flimsy and falls apart easily<br></li><li>Con 3 - The vehicle has to be forced into the docking bay and does not sit evenly with the spaceship.</li><li>Con 4 - because it is rare, it is expensive to buy if you need it to complete a collection.<br>
</li><li>Con 5 - Some of the construction items have no apparent use and kids hate it.<br></li></ul>
<p>Conclusion.&nbsp; You will most likely think this set is terrible. Only purchase it if you need it for a collection or someone gives it to you for free.&nbsp; This is my all-time worst lego set of all time (not just space) followed closely by one of the time bandits sets - the one that looks like a cross between a bat, a hot air balloon and a hang-glider.<br></p>",TRUE,2,4,2,2,3
"roshisan","2021-03-16T20:30:10.09Z","Nobodyâ€™s favorite, but mine","<p>I previously reviewed this set and now my feelings about it have solidified, as if I added fiber to my diet. I know it is a bizarre and ungainly craft, but it looks awesome sitting next to the 6842 aka Small Space Shuttle Craft aka Inspection Spacecraft (I thought it was Shuttle Craft) and the 6929 aka Starfleet Voyager aka Starfleet Voyager. Is anyone else confused by the Lego Group&#39;s naming conventions across multiple languages? In this case, they decided it was easier not to name it at all, but I digress. I enclosed the gaps in the upper cockpit with trans dark blue 1x4 bricks, which makes a world of difference. The 1593 is no weirder than other sets (I&#39;m talking to you, Robot Command Center) and the play value is high based on the docking rover and the previously mentioned (in another review) &quot;space age washing machine&quot;. The set works decently if you compare it to its donor sets from 1981 and 1982, instead of to its actual contemporary, the mighty 6980 Galaxy Commander (the pinnacle of Lego technology in 1983). Although routinely critiqued as the worst possible combination of its component parts, I respectfully disagree, as you will soon see below, and argue that the 1593 is a underrated gem two years in the making. The fact that large quantities of alcohol and/or the future designers of the Pontiac Aztek were likely involved is beside the point. So is the fact that the Classic Space line had moved past its color scheme, leaving it trapped in 1981. Or the fact that it is ugly. I didn&#39;t know this set existed when I was a kid, but am confident I would have loved it. What does that say about me? I enjoyed piecing it together from spare parts, but I decided I wanted the original directions, so I paid too much for a complete set, minus the box, unfortunately.<br />
All the bad reviews from the web, to include this site, have given the 1593 a massive inferiority complex and incredibly low self-esteem, so I intend to do something about it. Think about how you would feel if you were constantly being told you were the worst person in the world...ever. Imagine if you were a movie worse than Time Bandits (That &quot;Time Bandits&quot; set that was ranked higher, I mean less low, than this one in another review looks atrocious, by the way.&nbsp; I think he meant the Time Cruisers Time Tunnelator, but Time Bandits was a terrible movie, strengthening my analogy). Imagine if the only way to identify you was with a few numbers, like a prison inmate because your parents didn&#39;t care enough to name you (The Persil literature described the 1593 as &quot;Delta Spacecraft with Survey Vehicle...&quot; which sounds very Legoland Classic Spacey, but didn&#39;t stick). Or if you were advertised on the back of a laundry detergent box for L9.95 (About $13.00 in U.S currency) when the Starfleet Voyager went for $15.00. Imagine if you were &quot;only available in Europe&quot; (Canada too??) and never given a chance to travel to one of the largest Lego markets in the world and that the members of that market didn&#39;t even know about you until relatively recently. Does this sound like a pleasant existence? Welcome to the 1593&#39;s world. &nbsp;My question: why&nbsp;buy the set in the first place if you feel negatively about it. For the 1 to 2 other people out there, aside from me, who love this set,the best way to describe it is &quot;business in the front, party in the back&quot;. As such, I humbly complete my review of the Legoland 1593 Space Mullet. Now it has a proper name. &nbsp;Maybe I should stick with Delta Spacecraft with Survey Vehicle.</p>
