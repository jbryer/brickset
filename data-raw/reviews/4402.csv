When it comes to expanding your Toa Nuva and Bohrok Kal collection, you definitely want to pick a lot of these up. They are fairly inexpensive and their contents are really worth it. 

The last good think about this 'expansion set' (if you are so inclined to call it that) is that it just doesn't have the Kanohi Nuva in it, but it also contains protodermic versions of the Kanohi Nuva, which are harder to come buy. 

So overall, great contents, and a low price, earn this 'expansion set' a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
