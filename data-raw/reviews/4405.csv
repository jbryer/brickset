"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-13T18:05:50Z","The Coolest of the Toa Metru so far!","This is my favorite TM so far. Well, at least from the ones that I have.
The crossbow is one of the greatest weapons ever used for Toa. The launcher really works(imagine that), and goes farther than a regular launcher. Or at least from what I've seen.
The mask is rad, I mean super rad, I mean, oh what the heck, Its REALLY REALLY cool.
The one con is that they used one of those peices used on Rahkshi to turn their gears on him to turn his gears to work the arms. Not that its not a good use, but it just looks wierd.
Also, with the crossbow, it sticks up real high and makes him look kinda funky.
But still, it is all made up for with the absolute coolness, or shall I say warmness of Vakama.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-29T19:58:47Z","Toa Vakama","Someone pointed out that a lot of Bionicle sets either get a 1 or a 10. Honestly, if I could find any cons about this set, I'd list them and counted them against it, but I can't. This is a great set.

The Toa Metru now have up to 7 points of articulation, with the addition of elbows. Another improvement is the eyepiece can be easily removed, as it is attached to the head via plus rod. While the Turaga had different heights mainly due to length of legs, these guys' heights differ via position of their torso. The gears inside them are tilted slightly, making their arms come out at an angle.

Vakama is the first Toa I've seen to have a disk launcher, and also only has one weapon, something that hasn't been seen since the original 2001 Toa. The disk that he shoots is a special Toa disk, and I hear you can only get it with this set. The launcher can be stored on his back, and because it has flame designs on it, there are some who think it might double as a rocket pack. It functions just like the Matoran launchers.

I couldn't find anything negative about this set, as said above, so it gets a perfect score.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-10T20:11:19Z","Not too bad...","Okay, I'd like to start of by saying that this is in NOWAY similiar to any of last year's models. In fact, I think that there maybe...3...pieces that have even been seen in a set before. Now that that's out of the way...I like this set. It has good posebility, with articulation in the knees, hips, feet, arms, elbows, hands, and neck. I like the new color(unlike some people) it has a nice look to it, along with the mask. But My review is not all good. Frankly, I am getting tired of the repititiveness of the more recent sets. Even know, the only difference between sets are the weapons, masks, and hieght(which is easily adjusted via the two piece body). I really miss the shield of Kopaka, the Upside down body of Pohatu, and the Hunched Onua. Well, there always is next year, I s'pose. I just have to hope Lego listens to my calls for more varied sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T17:32:02Z","Vakama Metru","Head:+

Love the mask, the best metru mask ive had the pleasure of holding, bringing back memorys of the miru and kaukau from 2001. The new head, although odd at first, is better because it can be posed and has a removable eye piece. I at first complained about the new eye color, but agaist the new red it works realy well.

Torso:+

I love the new adjustable height feature, and the fact that each metru vairies this and back attachments. I like the new color, makes him stand out amoungst other bionicle toys, but if they had used normal red it would have looked plain wrong. my one gripe is the shoulder, which isnt as poseable as older sets

Arms:+
ELBOWS! COOL SHOULDERS! Nuff Said.

Legs:+
Robust, yet adgile and as poseable as a rahkshi, these are the best legs ever on any bionicle set! They are reaky cool, far better than the complecated knee of the rahkshi.

Weapon:~

Big, clubmsy, but witha cool disk and jet pack feature that counter this, i prefer the other toa metru's weapons myself, as this looks the least effective.

Overall +4 or 9/10 one of the best Bionicle toys ever, if only that weapon had been given more thought...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T10:31:17Z","I loved it!","Toa Vakama is a very well designed set and is quite unique to the other Metru. I'm lovin the adjustable torso (he's supposed to be kinda short but I made him the same size as Nokama) and the legs are kinda repetitive after the Rahkshi, but the feet aren't as bulky, I'll give em that. The arms can't quite reach as far as I thought they would, but I did enjoy the way the elbows can actually move, a new change after the Rahkshi (the only other sets whose elbows move are the other Toa Metru and Makuta) and the mask is very techy, perfect for the new urban setting. Overall, sure to become a classic.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The Toa Metru are supposed to represent the elements. In my view, fire is not an element, nor is stone.
This new crimson hue was the wrong decision for Lego. Vakama is incompatible with any other set, exept for other Vakamas.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-01T21:17:41Z","The latest red guy...","Pros:
New disk launcher has a cool design.
New shade of red. (Hey, some of us like variety.)
Adjustable torso height.
Movable elbows and posable head.
Removable eyepiece.

Cons:
One of the most usable pieces in this set (i.e. the double-ended socket) is in the new grey, and so less usable in MOCs.
Design of launcher limits the ways he can hold it.
Launcher is also pretty weak compared to Matoran launchers.
Arms are linked together, if you move one the other moves in the opposite direction.
No shoulder posability.
Elongated head looks wierd at first.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2016-09-24T20:02:16.72Z","My, Vakama, what green eyes you have","<p>The 2003 Bionicle storyline ended with Makuta seemingly defeated for good, possibly redeemed, possibly dead, possibly both. And with Mata Nui apparently on the way to awakening. There were no solid plans for the story past this point at the time (they ultimately went the cop-out route of negating the victory and saying Mata Nui still wasn&#39;t waking up yet grumble grumble). Instead, as hinted at the end of the Mask of Light movie, the plan was to jump back to the Time Before Time, to where and when the Matoran lived before coming to the Island of Mata Nui.</p>

<p>As it turned out, they lived in a great city called Metru Nui and had access to a lot more machinery than they were able to build on the island. And it was retconned that Turaga (originally simply Matoran priests according to the series bible) were in fact ex-Matoran Toa who had dispersed their power toward some end following or in the course of fulfilling their destiny. Thus, the Toa team of the 2004 toyline was comprised of the Toa forms of the 2001 Turaga characters. Toy-wise, these figures represented an increase in size and general articulation compared to previous Toa sets, although there were some flaws. They would set the bar for all subsequent Toa.</p>

<p>The subject of today&#39;s review is Toa Vakama.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As was still standard for Toa and those who shared their pricepoint, Vakama does not come in a box. He comes in a plastic canister that can be retained to store his parts. The lid for the canister, rather than serving as a Suva (shrine) for Vakama, instead serves as one half of a Matoran Sphere - combine it with another to make the complete sphere. Given the story function of the spheres it might have worked better to do that with the Vahki canister lids instead, but.. spoilers.</p>

<p>The instructions for Vakama are about what you&#39;d expect for a Bionicle set from this time. The steps show CGI or Photoshop renderings of the parts imposed over a background, in this case part of Metru Nui. The booklet includes the steps to build Vakama himself, and the first third of the instructions to build a Kralhi (the combiner model with Onewa and Matau. It&#39;s basically a scorpiontaur predecessor to the Vahki).<br />
The Kralhi instructions contain an outright mistake: they forget to tell you to build two of those leg assemblies.<br />
Vakama&#39;s instructions don&#39;t have any omissions per se, but they do feature an error in judgment shared with all Toa Metru instructions: they tell you to attach the chestplate/gearbox cover as soon as you&#39;ve inserted the arm gears. This is a bad idea. The angled arm sockets and the shape of the gearbox make aligning the gears a fiddly process, and until they&#39;ve had the axles and bushings inserted the gears can wiggle out of alignment even with the cover on. Plus without the axles it&#39;s tricky to tell for sure that a gear is aligned. So best to leave the chestplate off until that&#39;s taken care of.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Vakama comes with a nice selection of parts, most of them newly created for the Toa Metru. These would be the head, eyestalk, torso, pelvis, chestplate, kneecaps, lower legs, forearms, double-ended versions of the &quot;horseshoe&quot; socket pieces, feet, and paldrons. Unique to Vakama are his massive disk launcher and (at least at the time) his mask: A Great version of the Kanohi Huna, which gives complete invisibility in any lighting (as opposed to the weaker invisibility powers of the Noble version he wore as a Turaga). It shares some key features such as the shape of the eyehole cutout with the Noble Huna, but is overall more bulky. Much like the Avohkii and Kraahkan masks from 2003, it&#39;s made of semi-soft plastic and attaches via an axle instead of a stud, a trait it shares with the other Toa Metru masks. Also like all Toa Metru masks, it sweeps backward like a racewalking helmet to better cover the longer head and eyestalk. The head has a ball molded onto the end of the neck, useful for articulation. The eyestalk is attached via an axle instead of near-permanently snapping in like with the 2001-style Toa heads. Unfortunately, it&#39;s also colored transparent neon green. This is a continuity fail, since Vakama&#39;s eyes were established as being red with his 2001 toy. Nice going, Lego!</p>

<p>Going into more detail on the other new parts:</p>

<p>The pelvis has a ball at either hip where the legs connect, a decorative gear ridge, and an integrated Technic beam that protrudes upward. The beam fits into a slot in the torso and allows the pelvis to be anchored at different heights, thus making it easy to vary the height of Toa.<br />
The torso itself is tall and slender, with a smaller gearbox... and angled shoulder sockets. Not entirely a good idea, function-wise, though it does make the arms look more dramatic.<br />
The chestplate is designed to attach via pins and cover the gearbox.<br />
The new lower legs are designed like the Rahkshi lower legs, with an open ball at the bottom and a walled ball at the top. They&#39;re designed to use the double-horseshoe sockets as thighs to attach to the pelvis.<br />
The new forearms are small and resemble truncated versions of the 2001 Toa legs. They have an open ball at either end and are designed to use the double-horseshoes as upper arms<br />
The kneecap pieces connect to the double-horseshoe pieces used as thighs via Technic pins. They&#39;re small, but they have some nice sculpted piston detail.<br />
The paldron pieces fit over the double-horseshoes used as shoulders, attaching via axles. They&#39;re larger and more detailed than Toa Nuva paldrons.<br />
The disk launcher is farily hefty, and resembles a crossbow thanks to the arms with sculpted flames protruding from them. It&#39;s designed to fire the same kind of disk as hurled by Throwbots and the 2001 McDonald&#39;s Matoran. It&#39;s silver like the Toa Nuva weapons but isn&#39;t meant to be in their power league.<br />
Vakama comes with a unique disk -the disks of Metru Nui are called Kanoka Disks and have special powers, incidentally- to load his launcher with. It&#39;s transparent dark red, and has his mask and name printed on it as well a Kanoka Club code.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Vakama:</p>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward. You start by attaching the pelvis to the torso, then install the gears, then build and attach the legs, and next the arms, then attach the head, and finally pop on the mask and give him his weapon.</p>

<p>Kralhi (First third)</p>

<p>The build begins with connecting Vakama, Matau, and Onewa&#39;s pelvises together with pins. The middle pelvis of the stack faces the opposite direction of the other two, leaving a gap. A single horseshoe joint is inserted into this gap and anchored with an axle-with-stop piece. Vakama&#39;s torso is slid over the protruding part of the middle pelvis, and attached with another axle-with-stop piece that&#39;s driven through one of Matau&#39;s forearms. This axle then has a single horseshoe joint placed on top of it, while the other one has a double-horseshoe attached to its top and a gear attached to its bottom. After this, two identical legs are built using Vakama&#39;s lower legs, Onewa&#39;s feet and paldrons, and assorted pins, axles, and horseshoe joints.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Vakama stands fairly tall, taller than previous Toa designs. He has a good range of movement at the hip and knee, which is more than previous Toa designs had. He also as separately-jointed elbows, but it&#39;s a bit of a tradeoff: He lacks the range of shoulder motion that the early Toa designs had. Both limbs being geared -and there&#39;s no extra parts included so that you can have one arm geared and one arm not- doesn&#39;t work too well with the angled shoulder sockets; the arms have a tendency to bang into each other when you raise one for a strike. It&#39;s not too bad with Vakama since mostly you&#39;d just be lifting his launcher into firing position, but with some of the others... The disk launcher can be stored on his back either flames-up or flames-down. As far as using it&nbsp; as a weapon goes, it has good range and firing strength (careful using it outdoors! Don&#39;t want to lose the disk down a hole).</p>

<p>The other thing I want to talk about is color scheme. Vakama is dark red instead of standard red, and unlike Tahu he doesn&#39;t include orange as an accent color (indeed, none of the Toa Metru include a brighter color for accent purposes). However, due to their size and the extent to which they&#39;re visible as upper arms, the color of the double-horseshoe socket pieces ends up becoming an accent color... and in the case of the main Toa Metru those pieces are dark stone gray. The combination of dark red with dark stone gray doesn&#39;t say &quot;fire&quot; very well to me (and Lego learned their lesson on this with later Toa to use the base Metru design).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>So yeah, Toa Vakama has some definite flaws. But they don&#39;t stop him from being an enjoyable figure. He represents a step forward in Toa design overall, and is worth getting in my opinion.</p>

"Marce","2015-12-02T01:30:13.663Z","Toa Metru Vakama. The Best Bionicle Set EVER","<p>This is Toa Metru Vakama, red toa of fire. The set was released in 2004. Let&#39;s take a look at it</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set does not comes in a box, but it comes in a transparent&nbsp;canister with a red lid. The canister shows Vakama&nbsp;swinging around Ta-Metru with his disk launcher.</p>

<p>The instructions are not what we see now-days, they&#39;re kinda different (well, they&#39;re from 2004, so . . .) but they are decent. I feel proud of having some 11 year-old instructions!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is really an enjoyable one, specially the part of the torso and head area. Since I am a very fast builder, I built it like in 10 minutes or less, but that&#39;s just me. All I want to say is that you&#39;ll enjoy the build pretty much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is awesome, and what a better way to review it by discussing its pros and cons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get to them: (starting&nbsp;with the pros)</p>

<p>1) His points of articulation.</p>

<p>He has 6 points of articulation, on the ankles, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, and neck. This point allow posing more easy, and it&#39;s always good to have them.</p>

<p>2) The fact that he has knees and elbows.</p>

<p>This is a pro because before 2004, the bionicle sets didn&#39;t have knees or elbows, but this toa metru have, and they were super revolutionary, and people loved them because of this new addition. Knees and elbows provide new ways of posing, and posing won&#39;t be an issue.</p>

<p>3) His color scheme.</p>

<p>Vakama has a very concise color scheme, consisting of dark red (wine) and dark gray. It looks fantastic and it really resembles his element.</p>

<p>4) His weapon.</p>

<p>For weapon, Vakama has a big disk launcher, and not in red (like the toa mata) but in silver. The color of his weapon is a definite pro. And the fact that is launches a translucent red Kanoka&nbsp;disk, is amazing</p>

<p>5) The double purpose.</p>

<p>Another thing that this new weapons had, is storage. For instance, Vakama can store his weapon on his back, but not only that, the disk launcher becomes a jetpack!</p>

<p>6) The gear function.</p>

<p>Something amazing that Vakama has is his gear function. This gear function was introduced by the toa mata in 2001, but surprisingly, Vakama has it! The gear function consists of a lever on his back that you can turn and his arms rotate!</p>

<p>7) The head</p>

<p>This toa metru had new heads that had a ball joint connector instead of a socket joint, allowing more mobility. The eyes were also new, they were colored translucent pieces that did slide into the head and were connected with an axle rod.</p>

<p>8) the mask.</p>

<p>The mask was new. Instead of having a stud connection, now it has an axle rod attatched&nbsp;to the head for connection. This design is way sturdier.</p>

<p>That&#39;s for the pros, now let&#39;s move to the cons:</p>

<p>1) The awful blue pins.</p>

<p>This awful blue pins in his&nbsp;hands totally break the color scheme. I&#39;m pretty sure something can be done to change that.</p>

<p>2) The white axle rod in his chest</p>

<p>This also breaks the color scheme completely, but if you imagine that this is a heart-light, then it win&#39;t be a con for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think that this is a really nice set, if it weren&#39;t for those cons, it would be a perfect set. If you have any doubts, here I leave to you a link for a detailed review of Vakama on youtube from my friend Eljay&nbsp;from TTV Channel. See you guys later, and I hope I was helpful.</p>
