I am not biased, so I'll be honest about my reviews; this one gets an 8 because, there are two little cons.

Nokama is actually taller than Vakama (as I said, their heights are different), both because her torso is taller, and because her neck is mounted differently. When I see this, I always think about that weird situation where the     friend is taller the boyfriend (mind, Vakama and Nokama aren't interested in each other...at least, storywise. Lego has only given general descriptions). 

The Toa Metru are very alike, I must say, though I don't hit on that fact too hard, since they are different heights, I'll give credit to Lego for making some sort of difference. Nokama wields two 'Hydro Blades', at are somewhat similar to Gali Nuva's Aqua Axes, except the the shafts connecting the hilts to the hands are long, thin, and wavy. They aren't as weak as one may think, but I don't recomend bending them to test their stability.

Now for those two cons. One, her Hydro Blades are mounted to friction pins on her hands, not into her hands. This makes it a little difficult to pose her since they sometimes slide downward. I'm leaving it the way it is, but if you don't want that, you can try what OctopusV did, or just mounting them into the hands.

The con is her mask. Though I like its shape, design, and the fact that it is transparent (though the fact that you can place a clikit into the imprint on it is pretty unusual), it isn't transparent enough. It's more like a wax paper kind of transparecy, where it has a see-through quality, but you can barely make out her head on the other side.

Because of those two cons, this set gets an 8. That means she's still a pretty good set (5 is the dividing line between good and bad).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-11T21:37:55Z","REALLY COOL","This is my first bionicle since the first iterations.  These seem to be much taller (based on Nokama) Infact I'd say its BIG.  The poseability has increased by several new balljoints.  The overall build looks so much stronger and tougher than the originals.  I picked Nokama because of the transparent mask.  It's not completely transparent but it has a very glowy effect.  The eye-holes have a clearer transparency but stil not really enough to see the eyes behind the mask.  Good thing these guys wear masks, their faces are pretty ugly.  I think I'd like this one the most, the mask is the most unique and blue is my favorite color. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

but the hydro blades are attached to her hands in  a different way",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-09T14:48:36.607Z","With great colors","Nokama have great colors. I don't have gali, but i think that this mask have the same color. The blue pieces are more darker, and the mask have a good size. The hydro blades are cool used as in the instructions or no. The eyes are orange , awesome color. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lavalizard78","2008-12-29T14:35:38.42Z","ok set","this set is alright, i guess. it has a nice function of the gears to move the arma, the weapons atach to the hands so they can spin, but the arms get in the way. the mask is downright uglay, and the feet dont give much support to all that weight. overall---good set i would recommend it to add to your collection.

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-24T08:57:58.247Z","I like Nokama","She definitely gets a five.  I do have a couple of complaints, though; you'll see those in the Pros and Cons though.  I like her tools and the way you can swivel them around and around, and I like the mask.  It looks really watery.  The overall design is very good, and makes playing (or posing if you're like me) very easy and fun.  I have a small collection of Kanoka disks and launchers, and it's also pretty fun to put a Ga-Metru disk in the launcher and put it in her hand it a fighting pose with my Vahki Nuurahk.  So let me get my thoughts down in organized form:

Pros:

TOOLS!!

&quot;Watery&quot; Mask of Translation

Swiveling pivots for tools

&quot;Posabilty&quot;

Gear design inside torso

Cons:

Taller than Vakama in two (2) ways:  Her head is positioned a bit differently than Vakama's, and that makes her taller.  Then, the torso is made taller by bringing the leg thingy farther out of the upper torso than Vakama. These two together make Nokama quite a bit taller than Vakama.  You can fix this, though, by either changing Vakama or changing Nokama.  I don't like to do that, though, as it detracts from the originality of the set.

So, other than that Con, Nokama's a good set and worth getting.  I myself have Nokama, Vakama, Nuju, Onewa and Matau.  I'm still trying to find someone who's willing to give me Whenua for an okay price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dk_devilkid","2009-05-30T15:45:26.873Z","Nokama is cool","First of all I love her scuba weaponry. I think her mask is pretty cool too since it's see-through. Along with the others in this series she also has great posability. Not only that but if you also have Whenua and Nuju you can combine these 3 to make a big monster.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
