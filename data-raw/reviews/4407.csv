"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-02T18:37:11Z","Toa Whenua","This guy gets a 9, for one little con of course.

Whenua is still the shortest of the six, a pattern that has been followed since Bionicle's beginnings (as the black colored characters are all Earth element, the low head design goes with the concept of moving easily through tunnels).

On Turaga Whenua, his head was placed as low as it could be, and on Toa Whenua, he has the shortest torso of all the Toa Metru. His mask is rather unusual, and though some people once confused it to be the Vahi, it's not like any mask design I've seen in Bionicle.

He also has the smallest tools. His Earthshock drills are only 2 inches long, but Lego designed them with a unique feature. They are molded to interlock to form a kind of drill. But the drill itself is where the con comes in. For one, the edge is nowhere near pointed, and is actually rounded to the point where it doesn't look like it could ever be used for digging. 

But that isn't the con, which is you have to bend and twist his arms just to fit the tools together, and then, this very greatly restricts movement for Whenua.

Still, a 9 means a great set, and possibly a good starter set for the Toa Metru.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T16:00:56Z","really nice set!","Toa Whenua is probably the coolest Toa Metru made. Why? WEll for one, his Earthschock drills are really cool, and they form to make an even better drill. His mask design is also the best that I've seen so far. The long tubes on the ends really adds to the mask so it has more attetnion. (Unlike the other masks which are somewhat flatter. With the exeption of Nuju.) I just think that combined with his tools and mask, Whenua is my favorite Toa Metru set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T17:30:20Z","A solid choice for Bionicle fans","Toa Whenua is a good choice for all Bionicle fans. Although he has some flaws: 

1. His arms have limited range of motion when his drills are conected.

2. The neck design, used to make him shorter than the other Metru, restricts head movement somewhat.

However, there are many good qualities also:

1. Whenua has one of my favorite mask designs of the Toa Metru.

2. This next point can be seen as either a pro or con, but I believe it is a pro. His tools, the earthshock drills, are shorter than the other Toa's tools; however, this makes them very sturdy. They can handle much more abuse than, say, Onewa's proto pitons or Nokama's hydro blades. This tool design seems quite fitting considering that he uses them to dig through solid rock.

3. He's black... Black is always good. ;)

All in all, I'd say this set deserves a score of 9.6. So, rounded up, I give Toa Whenua a 10 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T10:36:08Z","Not quite so bad...","Whenua is one crazy dude. The mask is semi-ugly, makes me think of apes. I hate apes. And the earthshock drills make him look like he's a butterfly catcher or something. Good gosh, they don't even look like drills. Hammers would be a better name. However, he does have about the same poseability as the other Metru, and you gotta love those legs. Overall, not quite as cool as the others, but you have to love those Metru.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-21T20:19:21Z","Best of the Metru!","This is by far my favorite of the toa Metru. The mask is my favorite, owing a lot to the way the bottom two corners jut out. I have never really liked the way the earth element characters are shorter, only because this often made their figures awkward. With Toa Whenua's design, however, it simply gives him a sturdy look. Upon first seeing Toa Whenua's tools, I thought they were pathetic. However, after building the set, the tools became my favorite, possibly discluding Matau's aero slicers. To me, they resemble claws, which I like, despite the fact that they are supposed to be drills. Coupling all this with the great poseability that all Toa Metru have, I am forced to give this a 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-25T14:48:48Z","Whenua deserves applause!","I really love this set of Whenua. His Earthshock drills have a great design. Also, their capability to combine is one that no other Toa Metru's tool has. His mask is great, especially the eyes, giving him a dark look. Lego made a great decision in making him the shortest. Since he is dark it makes him seem darkest, mysterious, and unique. The only flaws in his design I can see are that his neck/head movement is stunted from the incompatability to rotate on the axis. This is because of his short stature. Also, the dark green &quot;brain&quot; is hard to see because it is dark. I would have changed the color to the light green of Nuhvok, because other Toa Metru had their &quot;brain&quot; color changed to that of their element's Bohrok. (i.e. Matau-Lehvak, Nokama-Gahlok...) Otherwise, I applaude Lego for their design of Whenua, the best of the Toa Metru.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-25T23:53:14Z","Great!","Okay, I know there are people out there who are gonna say I'm biased, but I'll just ignore 'em.
Okay, the metru toa are all pretty similar, so I decided only to get one, and that one was Whenua.  

FLEXIBILITY
I really enjoy the metru toa, because they are a breakthrough for flexibility with the toa sets.  They can move their head, at the elbows, hands, hips, knees, feet, and spin the gear on their back and their arms go up and down.
The one disappointment with them is that they have lost the ability to move at the shoulders.

HOW HE LOOKS
The metru toa are sleeker, taller, and thinner than the original toa and toa nuva.  I like their look a lot.  Whenua's mask is very interesting, and I like how it is similar to his mask when he's a turaga.

PLAY VALUE
Whenua is great fun to play with; you can put him in tons of cool poses, and Whenua is a vital character to the storyline.

OVERALL
Overall, the many pros overrule the few cons.  That's why I rate this set a 9.
But unless you're a serious collecter, I suggest to only buy one toa metru.  (Lots of people complain how all the sets are identical)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legozander","2007-02-05T05:19:48.817Z","My first Toa metru. :)","Toa Whenua was my first toa metru that I got and I was extremly happy with all`the new features and poseability that came with it. :) I loved all the new peices that came with this set the drills being my favourite parts.:) Whenua was the Toa that got me being an all round earth Toa/Matoran/Turaga fan. I loved his Kanohi mask and still do to this day.(Not to mention the new neck poseability.:) ) Although Whenua is the shortest of the toa metru somehow it brings me to like him even more!:)  So overall Toa Whenua is a great set and well worth getting.

"Gus_263","2008-02-12T12:41:25.437Z","Good job, lego","A good set, the strongest and smallest metru in size, but the most rich in pieces. The black colors are cool, the mask, and his weapon. The weapon when complete can be the most looks likely for a toa of earth, and it don't glows or lights-up. He have gear systems and a dark green eye.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"buzzandwoody2000","2009-08-08T21:09:49.75Z","Great Bionicle!","This was my first toa metru, and my favorite so far. I also have Nuju.
His drills are very cool, and his armour is just great!
I got this as a gift from a friend with many other bionicles.
I did notice this too: On his mask, the hole that is his mouth, is black. On the box, it is grey. 

Pros
drills
mask
nice detail
drills can be put together
good old gears
Cons
None!

You can have them seperate and just swipe at people or you can connect them to make what looks like a biig drill. I think he has the coolest mask of the toa metru as well. This is my favorite of the 6. If you like Boinicles and see him in the store absolutely do NOT hesistate to buy him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
