"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-26T18:43:39Z","Very cool toa. ","Onewa comes in second place to nuju but is just as cool. He has thirteen points of articulation, the most in a bionicle set. He is a middle sized toa ( not as tall as nuju or nokama but not as short as whenua ). His tools are very dourable and not easy to break. A much better impovement to pohatu. If you like bionicle, I highly suggest to get this toa.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

He has 13 points of movement, a very cool mask in my opinion, and there are many new pieces for Bonicle MOC builders to use. The only thing that bugs me is the weopon. It looks way too weak to me once i test the set.. then I will know.. :P

"Gus_263","2008-01-28T13:21:04.92Z","This toa of stone rocks","Onewa is the first of my metru. He is so cool, and have gear functions. The proto pitons and the mask have a awesome design for toa of the stone. The colors aren't the same of various bionicles, and it is a obstacle to make upgrades and creations. Another problem is th eyes. The original toa of stone eyes were orange,not dark blue.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T15:11:09.2Z","I Got Him From Bricklink!","I've always like Toa Metru, and this guy is no exception.  I like his Proton Piston tools; they can be used as grapnels to climb you dresser ;).  His eyes are dark blue and his head is gray, like the others'.  His mask looks neat, and he looks more than a match for fifty Vahki!  Here's the stats for Toa Metru Onewa:

Pros:

-Proton Piston tools

-Mask of Mind Control looks awesome

-Dark blue eyes

-Toa Metru just rock

-Can climb up your dresser :D

Cons:

-None!!

Go get Onewa (with Nokama)!!  You won't regret it, believe you me!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-16T17:55:13.95Z","Cool but....","I've always been a fan of the brown Bionicles. I think that Pohatu and Pohatu Nuva were awesome. Especially Pohatu Nuva. But this guy was kinda of a let down. 

Pros:
Colour
Cool armour
Feet

Cons:
Mask
String-like weapons

I know that there aren't many cons but they are really bad cons so that is why Onewa gets a 2/5.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

PROS-

rare armor

CONS-

"Alemas","2009-05-20T12:00:00.187Z","Great Onewa!","Onewa is very cool-looking, as it has twin stone tools, a gear on the back that swings the arms back and forth, cool mask, and bending legs! The bending legs were a first in 2004 for Bionicle, as they had fixed legs!

Pros:

Stone tools
Cool mask
Bending legs
Swinging arms

Cons:

None!

"dk_devilkid","2009-05-30T15:52:19.327Z","Odd looking mask but good","Onewa is good but my least favorite toa. His weapons are cool but his mask is ugly. When I am putting my bionicle on a shelf or something I always like to have him hanging on something to give him a more ""Onewa"" feel. If he is the only bionicle at the store get him. But if they have any others get them first.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"james3426","2009-10-18T01:37:05.67Z","Onewa, the climber.","This is a set is a good way of getting rare colored pieces. My favorite type of piece here has to be the shoulder armor, or the torso. The weapons are cool too, but they are so easily bent. On mine, they are bent, but still not broken. The Great Komau, mask of mind control is a cool mask with the big eye hole. The gear system is my favorite part because, it looks like he is digging when he is swinging his arms.

Pros:
Nice mask.
Cool shoulder armor.
Awesome swinging arms.
Cool weapons.
Nice colors.

A great Toa for anyone. Get this if you get the chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chavez365","2009-11-08T05:54:43.297Z","Really Cool!","Onewa is my only Toa Metru(for now!), and he has not disappointed. He has two very cool weapons that are like special pickaxes. Then he has a very neat mask with two awesome blue eyes. He matches his element well, because there basically only brown on him, and he is a Toa of Earth. Here are the pros and cons.
Pros:
Mask
Weapons
Matches element well
Has cool blue eyes
Cons:
Weapons are bendy, so they could break.
Onewa is really awesome, and I think is perfect as a starter for the Metru.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BrickBuiltBill","2019-05-24T13:21:40.5Z","It'd be easier to list off what they DIDN'T get right.","<p>As the title implies, I have a sort of bias regarding Constraction, which becomes&nbsp;a moot point since this figure came&nbsp;before my Bionicle phase. Even with this clean slate, I still have nothing but good things to say about Onewa! Well, except maybe the possibility of his &quot;Proto Pitons&quot; becoming warped. Still, tender love and care can prevent that. One thing I&#39;ve observed is that a number of factors give him a mountain&nbsp;climber-esque feel: The general shape of his Kanohi mask, the aforementioned Pitons, and, of course, the fact that he&#39;s the Toa of Stone. Would definitely recommend picking up if the price is right.</p>
