"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-31T14:52:32Z","Toa Matau","Like with my other reviews, I try to keep bias out of the way. This set gets a 9 instead of a 10 because of one little con.

Around the same height as Vakama, he is one of the four Toa whose color has changed slightly (for unkown reasons to me). Matau, as said by Purple Dave (head of MaskofDestiny.com), is obviously      ed off of Lewa Nuva, and much has improved. For one thing, like Lewa Nuva, he has sword-like weapons that can double as wings, but what has improved is that these swords attach directly to his back, rather than Lewa Nuva, who looks really weird because he just holds his swords differently to double as wings. Now Matau can pose without crashing, as his arms are free to move.

But speaking of the swords, the con: Matau holds the swords not at the end, but in the middle, as there is a cut-in part of the weapons where a plus rod tip is. I guess this was supposed to make the swords double as wings easier, but it still looks a little strange that he's holding them within the sword.

On a better note, his mask is awesome. It looks sort of like a robot, as is very large. Combined with the wings on the back making him look like a Toa attached to a glider, Matau is very space-age-like. He's one of the cooler Toa that I've seen.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T05:11:47Z","Another great one lego","Toa matatu May not be one of the best toa metru but he is still awesome. HIs mask looks robotic and his body is a really cool dark green . He has a very flexible body, you can great battle sceens with. He looks even cooler when his weapons attach to his back",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T07:21:35Z","Cool for the most part","I personally believe Matau to be the best Toa Metru. He's a nice, dark shade of green, which I like, and has very nice looking weapons. True, I'd like it more if they were held better, but that's one fault. 

Like all the Toa Metru, he has many points of articulation, which are extremely useful on him as he is able to 'fly' by using his swords as some sort of 'wings'. 

His mask is the most noticeable point on him, like on all Toa. The masks have to be made in such a way as they reflect the Toa's personality, as they are the Toa's face. I think the mask reflect's Matau's personality very well, and is a good take on the original mahiki.

Although not perfect, it's almost impossible to get anything perfect, but this is an exceptionally good set. I give it 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T10:49:34Z","He's okay, I guess","Matau is... okay. Not great, just okay. He's still cool, but the swords... looks like he's pinching them between his fingers. And the mask looks like... well... I can't quite describe it... it just looks more like it ought to belong to a water Toa instead of an air one. And one more big peeve--his head is attached by the socket joint horizontally, instead of vertically like Nuju--meaning that when he attaches the swords to his back like wings, and flies, he is always looking down. Very, very dorky. But he's still cool. All Toa Metru are cool. With the possible exception of Whenua... blargh...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-16T13:07:58Z","The most awesome Bionicle EVER!","This is the most coolest design of any other bionicle! I like to use the wings for knifes on his hands. He's not really cool with them on his back. I like to have bionicles be giant robots attacking my LEGO city, and then the dinos come in and stop him! This Bionicle has the coolest look! Also his mask!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"CyandraZ","2007-08-19T17:32:35.787Z","A great air Toa!","Matau

The Toa Metru can be considered the beginning of the modern Bionicle canister set construction. For the first time, arms and legs had 3 joints, and this was accomplished by the double ball joint connector, a brand new piece at the time. Still, The Toa Metru are not quite as tall as today’s sets, and they still used gear functions, which have now been eliminated from canister sets (which, I believe is both a good and bad move, but mainly good, since gear functions always looked ugly on sets).

Matau is the Toa Metru of Air, and the first Toa to use dark green, which is now the standard. I seriously like this color much better than the older green, as the older green seems to fit a Toa of Plant Control better. As with the other Metru, the gray joints look plain, and considering that they are used in every Toa Metru, it gets rather boring.

As with most of the Toa Metru, Matau features only two unique molds: his mask and his katana. The mask is not my favorite, but it looks good on Matau and fits his clumsy and reckless personality nicely. The katana are more or less a rectangular version of Lewa Nuva’s katana, but the axle is built inside the mold, and doesn’t just stick out. I like this mold, and it works great when building multi piece weapons like staffs.

Like the previous air Toa, Lewa Nuva, Matau can use his katana as glider wings, but they stick on his back instead of his hands.

So overall, Matau is a great kit, and one of the best of the Toa Metru. I highly recommend him! 5/5

The toa metru are taller than the mata and nuva, and they have also gears. Matau have a so cool designed mask, the second favorite of my brother. Matau have some other awesome things, like his aero slicers that can be combined with his back to be wings (He is the first toa with wings), a great system to be used in some bionicle. He like all other Toa Metru features also a canister that have a CD promo (not in all), and a code that appear on the canister if you put it in the freezer, like the roboriders. With a Lot of awesome features, i rate matau 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set has gear functions(which aren't use in bionicle anymore) which allows him to move the arms and some slashing.Also you can place the swords in the back and make them work as wings.Also the mask is cool and the color is sweet.Out of everything add together a 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-28T13:48:07.06Z","(Clumsy) Toa Metru of Air","So this is Matau, a great Toa Metru to add to my collection.  My favorite parts about him include the Areo Slicers that can become wings and the Mask of Illusion.  This is also one of the first Bionicles to have fully articulate joints rather than the stiff-legged Toa Mata and Toa Nuva.
Matau has good posing ability, and is very swooshable in flying mode.  Altogether a five out of five.  Pros and Cons are:

Pros:

-Aero Slicers can become wings

-Mask of Illusion is cool looking

-Very swooshable

-Playable

-Posable

Cons:

-Can't look up, like Vakama and Onewa

"Nmfrey23","2022-04-14T16:37:40.543Z","A step above the Toa Mata","<p>Matau was my first experience with the Toa Metru. The six new Toa from 2004 changed up the building style a lot from the past two waves of Toa sets. Featuring elbows, knees and moving necks, there were more moving parts involved in these Toa sets. I loved this new building system since it made the characters look so much more mechanical while still being fairly complex. Since the Toa Metru are all somewhat similar, I figured I&#39;d start with Matau.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New Parts: There&#39;s a lot to cover with the new parts the Toa Metru introduce. The feet, upper and lower legs, leg armour, torso, chest plate, shoulder armour, forearms, head piece, eye piece, mask, and swords are all new.</p>

<p>Movement: First wave of Toa to feature Knees and Elbows (knees became commonplace in 2003, elbows in 2004).</p>

<p>Functions: Matau features 2 functions. His gear function works similarly to theToa Mata&nbsp;functions, but uses gears that are integrated into the set rather than exposed gears. This allows Matau to swing his swords. His second function allows him to stow his swords on his back (they double as wings)</p>

<p>Colors: The Toa Metru saw a shift to a darker colour palate. Instead of green or lime, Matau uses a shade of dark green.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The gears attached to each arm can become offset. Sometimes, the chest cover needs to be removed to fix this.</p>

<p>No shoulder movement.</p>

<p>Some may not like how thin the shoulder attachments are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Matau is a very solid canister set, and is one of the better Metru sets in my opinion. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with Bionicle, this would be a great set to start with--not too simple, not too complex, and a good summation of what the theme was like. 4/5.</p>
