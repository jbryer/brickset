The ghost slides behind the tree on a neat little mechanism.  This set reminds me of the older sets I had as a child, and jsut recently aquireing it, I am proud to say I own it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-07T08:31:43.787Z","Secret Ghost","This is the smallest of the wolfpack sets and the only one that's US only.  On first look this set suffers from a bit of design issues.  Why is the tree black?  What else is there to do with this set with just the wolfpack men and the ghost?

Well, the tree is black because it's been charred by a fire.  There are some green growth on it because the tree isn't completely dead.  The interesting part about the tree is that there's a lever which allows the ghost to be hidden inside the tree, and it can be slid out to go &quot;Boo!&quot;.  It's not hidden very well though due to the design of the tree - an arm is still visible.

A grey parrot completes the set and gives it a spookier atmosphere which is a good touch.  Overall, a nice small set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-16T12:18:45.543Z","Old Small castle set","I like these old castle sets. They can be very small or with old style pieces, but the pieces are very useful and in a simple and good design. This set includes two minifigures, a wolf knight (not exactly a knight), that carries a sword and a shield, and includes also a classic ghost minifigure, that is in a old style but still great. The small plate can be used in some other themes, and the pieces included are basically few black blocks, but good builted. There are also some plants, a spear, a minifigure of a bird and these pieces are useful for the old castle themes, or new. The playability is basic and the building also, but it makes a nice design on a little set. Due to the great use of the pieces and some other features, i rate the Ghostly Hideout 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2010-10-22T11:56:29.263Z","Ghostly Hideout Review","<p>One of the few sets to feature the Wolf Pack subtheme of Castle, this is a must have to complete that series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also features one of the first few ghosts to be featured with Castle, a grey parrot which is meant to be a falcon or some other bird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main model is a tree, suggesting that this scene takes place in a forest. It's an enjoyable little set to have and add to any forest scenes.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"tjprescott","2011-11-22T02:01:33.433Z","Nice little set--buy the individual bricks though!","I received this set as a gift when I was a kid and it was still in production. &nbsp;It currently sells for about $22 on Bricklink, making it almost $1/piece--outrageous!! &nbsp;It should be much cheaper to buy the piece separately as none are particularly rare.<div><br></div><div>First of all, I'm biased: I L-O-V-E forest sets. &nbsp;It's a simple, elegant and attractive design and is fun to play with. &nbsp;The only downside is that the ghost is not full hidden by the tree and it's a bit hard to remove the ghost from inside. &nbsp;You have to dislodge him from his plate and shake the thing until he falls out. &nbsp;Still, it's a nice quality and fun design.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Disclaimer!</h4><div>This set is discontinued. &nbsp;The purpose of my review is to suggest to a LEGO fan whether this is a quality set to add to their collection. &nbsp;My overall rating is based ONLY on Playability and Building Experience. &nbsp;See the LEGO Interests section of my profile for my review philosophy on discontinued sets.</div></div>",TRUE,4,2,4,4,1
"redbeardlegoman","2013-02-22T16:12:00.297Z","Peek-a-BOO!","<p>This was one of those great sets that, had I been able to at the time, I would have bought twenty of. &nbsp;I had to make due with two on my limited allowance. &nbsp;For $4 ($6 CAD, I think...) you got some great stuff in a small set.</p><p>There was a member of the Wolf Pack, which was a sadly under-supported but wholly awesome sub-theme. &nbsp;He had a printed shield, which you couldn't acquire very many of had this set not been released. &nbsp;There was also one of those fabulous glow-in-the-dark ghosts, which you simply can't have too many of. &nbsp;Throw in a sword, leaves, a spear and a falcon, and you've got a sweet parts pack.</p><p>It also comes with a LURP, which could be good or bad depending on your opinion of them.</p><p>I will say, in the LURP's defense, that it IS used well as part of the efficient peek-a-boo mechanism for the ghost.</p><p>That same peek-a-boo mechanism presents the only minor flaws with the set. &nbsp;The ghost is not completely hidden. &nbsp;You can still see its arm. &nbsp;Whether or not that was intentional, I've never been satisfied with it. &nbsp;As well, and of much lesser irritation is that the ghost is hard to remove from the set due to the overhanging branch. &nbsp;On, the other hand, the ghost is held fast, and never just pops off when using the mechanism. &nbsp;I think that makes it a half-con, really.</p><p>While it is now a lot more expensive ($30 USD for the only used set on Brick Link at the time of writing) to get this discontinued set, that's the nature of older sets that are highly desirable. &nbsp;And THAT is why I wish I had been able to get more than two back in the day.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>A must have to complete the greatest sub-theme that never got the love it deserved.</li><li>Two great minifigs, a Wolf Pack shield, a sword, a spear, leaves and a falcon.</li><li>Great use of the much-maligned LURP.</li><li>Cute peek-a-boo mechanism for high playability.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The ghost is not completely hidden.</li><li>It's hard to remove the ghost from the cave (1/2 con).</li></ul>
<p>If I had a wish, it would be that TLG would re-release The Wolf Pack. &nbsp;This set, one of the three released, helped fill out a sadly neglected sub-theme of great potential.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
