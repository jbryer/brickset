"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-31T15:01:38Z","Toa Nuju","This perfect 10, as I can't really say anything bad about him.

If you like a Toa whose features are larger than life, you should check Nuju out. Everything about him is huge!

First off, his tools. My guess is that they are kind of like pickaxes, covered with spikes of course. These things a massive! They're like 2.5 to 3 inches long, and 1.5 to 2 inches thick! By far the most massive weapons I have ever seen on a Toa, unless you count Vakama's disk launcher. Instead of attaching to his back for storage, you can put them on his feet to wear as snowshoes! If you look in the picture, you can see the pins on his pickaxes that are meant to attach to his feet.

Then there's his mask. Also very large and very exaggerated. That eyehole sticks out almost an inch! And for the first time, the techno eye of the white Toa actually has a place to see through. It's about time!

Nuju and Nokama are the two tallest Toa Metru, as both their necks and torsos are mounted to be the tallest. So that's one more thing that makes Nuju a giant among the Toa Metru. If you're looking for big, and a Toa Metru, this one is a good pick!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-26T18:37:13Z","Best bionicle set this year. ","Nuju is one of the best toa I have ever seen. His tools are massive and menasing, unlike kopaka, his scope accualy lights up which is a new thing. He is the tallest toa ( except for nokama, who is as big as him ) and he has the biggest mask this year as well. He also has 13 points of articulation, the most ever in a bionicle set. There is nothing I can dislike about him. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-05T16:12:20Z","Yay!","This IS Bionicle. All the other sets are pants so far. Nuju, Whenua, Ehyre and Tehutti are the only characters with the original colours.
If you can find Nuju, buy him! You won't be disappointed. I wasn't ;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-12T15:04:22Z","So cool","I think this set is even better than the kopaka nuva! His wepons are  great for mocs and he comes with the best mask! He is very easy to stand and swing his arms around. I would recomend this set to every bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T15:22:09Z","Could be better","This set is the same as all of the rest of the Toa Metru, which are all great sets, but his monocle just detracts so much from it. When looking at it from the side, it just sticks out, and takes away from the whole feeling of it. I would recommend Matau.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T23:22:04Z","One of the best toa metru","Toa nuju has got to be one of my favorite toa metru. His Mask is just awsome, Even though the scope s on the oppisite side to kopakas it is still great, an the best thing about it all is that idf lego decides to relase coloured metru mask his black mask  will be perfect fo a borg MOC. 
His weapons Are also cool Not only that htey can fit on his feet also they make great weapons . 
overall 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T09:59:15Z","Interesting set","Well, I actually picked this set up.  I decided just to see how it was.  The construction was fast.  The toy itself was all right looking, although it looks like kind of a mix between an executioner and a cultist.
The set looks all right, as I have stated, but after a little while, it's not too fun to play with.  Unlike, say, a castle or pirate ship, or even a space ship there is no way to put this guy into cool places except places in the room.  In other sets, the mini-figs can go places inside of the vehicle/building/whatever.  He's just not very playable over all.
I am fine with LEGO doing Bionicle -- the fan website has thousands of members, so some people must like it -- but I also wish that they would focus on Legends and stuff, too.  *coughGOODPIRATEcough*
Anyway, since this set isn't a TOTAL waste(I put him on Hoth and had my Snowspeeder blast him), and since some people obviously like him, I give it a 5.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T10:43:09Z","This I like... This I like very much!","Nuju is by far an excellent Toa Metru. His mask is very polygonical (is that a word even?) and since the crystal spikes can become snowshoes, I can pose him out in light snow without him falling trhough (that happened to Kopaka Nuva once.) Of course, he's the tallest, same as Turaga Nuju (who I don't actually have, but my lil bro and two best friends do.) Then, we've got poseability. Neck moves, elbows bend, arms move, knees bend, legs move, feet move, makes for a good variety of interesting poses (I can actually make him meditate, not a very good idea to try on Kopaka Nuva.) Overall, I love him. But one thing...

If his mask is the Mask of Telekinesis, why does he have a scope thingy on it?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T17:58:11Z","Outstanding set!","Toa Nuju is another fantastic addition to the Bionicle line.  Following in the tradition of the other Toa, Nuju has a &quot;Kanohi&quot; mask.  It is superbly crafted, with a nice-looking zoom lens.  The weapons of Nuju are well designed as well.  They are big, hardy &quot;crystal spikes&quot;, and can double as snow-shoes.  And the Toa itself is very well constructed, with multiple points of articulation.  I would heartily recommend this set to any Bionicle fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-19T09:02:47Z","Wow!","Wow! This set is good! I like the way the arms and legs move! They are better then the Nuva! I really like the mask of Nuju. It looks sleek, sharp, and not sort of molded like the nuva masks. And the wepons look awsummmmmm!
I ovarall rate Toa Nuju as 9/10. I am looking foward for more bionicle sets!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-23T19:51:27Z","Awesome","I think that this is the best of the Toa Metru line. The regular white is kind of &quot;retro&quot; compared to all of the new colors for the Metru Nui Saga. Toa Nuju has the most innovative weapons, and I like how he uses them as snowshoes",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-12T07:18:02Z","pretty cool set","The toa metru are really cool because they have bending legs and arms.

Nuju is one of the tallest toa metru.

the only things i dont like about him is that his robotic eye sticks out a bit to much which gets a bit annoying.
",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-09T14:31:48.297Z","Toa Metru of ice","One of the coolest. The crystal spikes, his weapon, can be used as a feet addition, using it the toa like a ice man. Great use of this weapon, never showed at the movie. The mask is great, too in size, the shape is cool, and the great eye position is in the left side, no in the right, like kopaka. The armors, legs, and arms are the same of the other metru. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-27T12:22:43.78Z","Great Toa Metru!!","This is a great Toa and well worth the money.  And, for the first time in Bionicle history, THERE IS A HOLE IN HIS MASK FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH :D!!  The Crystal Spikes are very detailed and can be put on his feet for snowshoes, but they can't be put on his back like on the other Toa Metru.  He is the tallest of the Toa Metru except Nokama, and other than that one problem about putting the weapons on his back, he's worth the price.

Pros:

-Crystal Spikes are detailed and BIG

-Hole in Mask of Telekinesis :D

-Weapons turn into snowshoes

-Tallest Toa Metru (other than Nokama)

Cons:

-Can't put Crystal Spikes on his back

Go get this great Toa!!  He's worth the trouble!

"SaintElsewhere","2008-12-21T21:07:51.53Z","Cool. (Pun intended)","The Toa Metru are my favourite Toa, so I am a little biased. Forgive me. :)

Pros:
cool mask
ice picks double as snow-shoes
head can tilt up, unlike other Metrus
like the gear in back that moves the arms

Cons:
Uh-huh. Yeah.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dk_devilkid","2009-05-30T16:03:05.717Z","Gives me chills","This guy is so cool it gives me chills (pun intended). I honestly don't like his weapons so I stick them on his feet to make skies. His mask looks i like it can just stare through you. This guy can be combined with Whenua and Nokama to create a huge monster.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Master_Wu","2019-03-19T23:23:29.707Z","Cool Ice Robot","<p>This set is pretty cheap making it good for it&#39;s money. It looks awesome when it&#39;s built but the parts alone aren&#39;t very good. This cool robot mech is just great for posing and moving around to play with. There is a&nbsp;function on the back where you turn a gear and the arms swing around and slice things with his weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this set is not something <strong>I</strong> would normally purchase but It&#39;s a fun, tricky build and it&#39;s fun to play with.</p>
