"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-08T01:04:07Z","A good set","I give this set a six because it has the neat disk thrower and a glow in the dark disk,also I like the two tone color on the mask and the return of the old Bionicle head but in a dark gray.The only thing I don't like about the set is having to put a 2 axel in the slot that hooks the legs
the legs together and that does not leave much mobility.But other wise this is a fun set.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-13T18:27:23Z","Awesome","I like to pretend that the Toa Metru are Knights because they have Midevil weapons (Vakama: crossbow Matau: swords
Nokama: bladed whips Nuju: bladed clubs Onewa: Grappling hooks Whenua: clubs) and that the &quot;Metruan&quot; are their squires, armed with mini crossbows. 
Nuhrii makes a great squire, what with his armor, weapons, and ability to help Vakama.
Well anyway, unfortunately he has no back, but it is made up for with the color and &quot;heatness&quot; lol",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T19:51:21.623Z","Great to play","This like the other matoran of metru nui, changing only in color. He have the same silver painting on the mask, and a armor as body, having nothing on back. The mask is a noble ruru well maded, with good quality. The disk launcher is silver and includes a ta-metru disk.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-04-28T09:02:01.577Z","Neat little Matoran","I got this yesterday from a friend who found him, along with Orkahm, in a garage sale.  They were both sealed in their boxes, but the boxes were severely crunched up.
When I built him, I was pleasantly surprised by his 'playability.' I thought the 2004 Matoran were rather stiff and not fun to pose, but this guy is neat!  Unlike Orkahm, Nuhrii's head matches his body perfectly.  Not that I don't like Orkahm or anything, it's just that his head kinda sticks out.  Anyway, another neat thing about Nuhrii is that there's a long pin on his back to hold the disk launcher on to his back.

Pros:

-Posable and playable

-Cool looking

-Disk launcher and disk

-Place to put the launcher and disk on his back

Cons:

-None

Altogether, 5/5, nice set.  If you get the chance, try and get him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bajadogq","2009-12-14T21:44:34.89Z","Nuhrii, the Ta-Matoran Mask Maker","I noticed how there were only a few reviews on this little guy, so I had to write one. For starters, he's dark red and dark gray. His mask has bits of silver paint melding with dark read on it. He has a glow-in-the-dark disc and launcher (which really works!). A pin allows you to have him carry the launcher on his back. His ability to pose is okay, but limited.

Pros:
- Mask
- Overall Design
- Color Scheme
- Launcher

Cons:
- Limited posability

Overall this is a pretty well designed set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kopaka43","2011-05-30T02:47:43.163Z","A pretty good set.","<p>Nuhrii is my only '04 matoran set, and arrived in a Bionicle bulk lot from Ebay. I must say, I was very pleased with his pieces, coloration, etc. My only gripe about this little guy is that his neck is a bit too long. This can easily be fixed with a few pieces, though. All in all, a great set, and worth getting if you see him for a reasonable price.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The revival of the original Bionicle pre-mask is awesome.<br></li><li>-The Kanoka launcher is an amazing weapon, always.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The model feels incomplete in the back, especially with the long connector peg. <br></li><li>-The mask also feels a bit incomplete at the top.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This Matoran is quite nice, and adds a nice little variety to canister sets in terms of size. This is recommended to all who collect mainly Bionicle canister sets.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
