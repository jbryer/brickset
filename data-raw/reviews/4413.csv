The got packed away in the big box before i had a chance to build them. So When i was browsing here and saw them I thought &quot;gee wish i had bought them&quot; You can  only imagine the shock i got digging through my box and found not one but 6 unopened boxes of models i said i wanted days before.

Anyway here's my review. Personally i like them. They are a great addition to the bionicle story and help build great army's to reinforce the Toa in battle. The disk launchers are good for short or long range but could have a little more power in the firing mechanism.

The only real flaw is they have no backing but i haven't found this makes them any less poseable.

The other thing I forgot to mention was the Numbering on the disks. This is a great idea for anyone who wishes to collect these. I wish all things like Slizer disks, Robo Riders wheels etc. had some for of numbering on them for catalogue reference.

Overall I rate these guys a 7/10 and although they look very similar i would recommend getting all six to build you collection up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Carl","2009-11-08T21:50:58.56Z","Nice little guy","To me, this guy looks like he means business. And with that awesome Kanoka disk launcher, he looks like he can take on a Visorak army any time, any day.

Pros:

Turaga Vakama's mask
Two toned mask - black and silver
Nice build
Kanoka disk launcher
Looks dangerous

Cons:

NONE!

Overall Tehutti is my second favourite Metru Nui Matoran and he is a must have for all Bionicle fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-22T19:57:22.343Z","Black and silver colors","You can see this matoran in other form in the mata nui on-line game, and this set have his metru form! It is cool, and more when the mask have a silver painting on head making it looks different. The eyes are dark green, it don't glows much in a dark head, but it don't makes the set uncool. Saying in glow, the disk glow in the dark.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bohrok96","2010-12-22T15:56:13.14Z","Good","Well tehutti is a good metru matoran with good mixture of colours, nice looking and have a good playability beacuse of the kahnoka. the kahnoka is also made to fit on his back, very good in posing. the touch of silver in the mask is very nice like all of the six metru matorans. this also make the kahnoka fit in very well when it´s not the only silver in the set.&nbsp;hi´s eyecolour is good fitted to the black in hi´s mask and body just as the rest of him. overall a very good small little bionicle. definetly worth buying.",FALSE,4,2,2,4,5
