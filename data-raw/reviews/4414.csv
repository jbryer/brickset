"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-13T18:34:25Z","Awesome","Ahkmou may be evil, but Nedhiki and Krekka still plan to kill him. My plot is that the Toa Metru and Metruan discover Morcia, and team up to defeat the Shadow Knights, Vladek, Nedhiki, and Krekka.
Ahkmou looks like the biggest metruan, but its just his mask. I love his disk design, ment to look like the Po-Metru sculpture fields. I love Bionicle and Knight's kingdom because of how much imagination went into it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-07-26T11:09:21.63Z","Matoran Army II","This model  also has a funny story behind it. I actually purchased all 6 of them just before i moved house. The got packed away in the big box before i had a chance to build them. So When i was browsing here and saw them I thought &quot;gee wish i had bought them&quot; You can  only imagine the shock i got digging through my box and found not one but 6 unopened boxes of models i said i wanted days before.

Anyway here's my review. Personally i like them. They are a great addition to the bionicle story and help build great army's to reinforce the toa in battle. The disk launchers are good for short or long range but could have a little more power in the firing mechanism.

The only real flaw is they have no backing but i haven't found this makes them any less poseable.

This particular model dose look bigger but along side the others isn't really.

Overall I rate these guys a 7/10 and although they look very similar i would recommend getting all six to build you collection up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This little set looks like the other matoran, but have another mask and colors. The disk have another details, and the mask have the silver painting. The legs and arms are the same, used later on rahaga. The launcher is silver, but you can find more colors on the kanoka assortment pack. A good set, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The Kanoka disc is a nice little weapon of evil, which glows up in the dark.<br></li><li>-The mask and eye color are both reasonably well compatible, surprisingly.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The back of this set is truly incomplete, and looks horrible for stop-motion lovers.<br></li><li>-This little guy looks just too similar to the other Matoran of this year.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>I like this set a lot, mainly because I just learned his unique and evil storyline of the year, finally fulfilling my dream of getting a truly evil Matoran. Buy it when a low price comes around. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Nmfrey23","2022-06-04T02:43:45.137Z","Traitorous little Matoran","<p>Ahkmou is quite the devious Bionicle character. Wether he&#39;s lacing the possessions of other Matoran with disease or delaying the local Kolhii game (sport in Bionicle that&#39;s an odd mix&nbsp;between 3 way football and hockey), this guy would always find his way into trouble, setting him apart from the other Matoran. Although, at the end of the day, he&#39;s built just the same as the rest of them. The Metru Nui Matoran sets are pretty good as far as small sets go, providing just enough to make them interesting additions to Bionicle&#39;s catalogue of sets, and Ahkmou is no different.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: The limbs, torso piece and the handheld disk launcher are new parts for 2004. The disk is a glow in the dark reprint of the Slizer disks from 1999, and Ahkmou&#39;s mask is a striking recolour of Turaga Nokama&#39;s mask (2001) in brown and silver.</p>

<p>Overall movement: The Metru Nui Matoran were the first small sets to have 2 ball joints in both the arms and legs. Additionally, Ahkmou features generous neck movement (at least compared to small sets at the time).</p>

<p>The disk launcher works well and can be stowed away on Ahkmou&#39;s back.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Limb movement is stiff since all four are pre-bent.</p>

<p>The blue pins in the torso can break up the look of Metru Matoran that don&#39;t already feature blue or a complimenting color.</p>

<p>The torso piece is completely hollow. This set&nbsp;(as well as the rest of the Metru Matoran) doesn&#39;t look good from the back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, Ahkmou brings a lot of new things to the table despite only being 27 parts. Ahkmou, like the other Metru Matoran,&nbsp;is small, but is still a fairly priced set even as of today. Overall, Ahkmou is just&nbsp;a fun set to build and enjoy. 3/5</p>
