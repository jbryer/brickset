First of all is the disc launcher. The disc flies about five feet when launched, and have their own code to tell where it was made, who made it, and which number it is that this person made.
Next is the blended mask. It is chromish at the top, and is green in the face area.
Third is the armor. Although it makes the action figure have no back, it is still awesome.
Finally is the new eye color. His eyes are more of a blood red color, darker than Tahu's red.
These new Metruan will be in my collection, and they should be in yours. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The thing i like most about Orkahm is his ,mask . The green and grey matatu is really cool . ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-12-07T22:30:56.42Z","Matoran Army IV","This model also has a funny story behind it. I actually purchased all 6 of them just before I moved house. The got packed away in the big box before I had a chance to build them. So When I was browsing here and saw them I thought &quot;gee wish I had bought them&quot; You can only imagine the shock I got digging through my box and found not one but 6 unopened boxes of models I said I wanted days before.

Anyway here's my review. Personally I like them. They are a great addition to the Bionicle story and help build great army's to reinforce the Toa in battle. The disk launchers are good for short or long range but could have a little more power in the firing mechanism. I can get this ones to go about three meters.

I must say I also really like the blended mask. The way the green melds in with the silver is just awesome and brings another feature to the long list of masks. The only real flaw is they have no backing but I haven't found this makes them any less poseable.

The other thing I wanted to mention was the numbering on the disks. This is a great idea for anyone who wishes to collect these. I wish all things like Slizer disks, Robo Riders wheels etc. had some for of numbering on them for catalogue reference.

Overall I rate these guys a 7/10 and although they look very similar I would recommend getting all six to build your Bionicle army or collection up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-23T17:37:45.84Z","Great le-matoran","A great set, with awesome color scheme. The dark green and silver painting in the mask are awesome to this mask shape. Orkahm like all matoran of 2004 have the same arms, legs, armor(used as body), a disk launcher, and dark colored heads. The eyes color are the respective of the toa metru (orkahm have a red, same of matau). These matorans also featurees a combination model on instructions. The disks also glow.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-04-28T09:06:04.937Z","Okay Matoran","I got him along with Nuhrii from my friend who got him in his factory sealed box at a garage sale.  I like him, although not as much as Nuhrii.  Still, I'm not gonna give him away or sell him for anything.

Pros:

-Disk and launcher

-Posable and playable

-Place to put launcher and disk on his back

Cons:

-Head kinda sticks up

Altogether, a nice Matoran, 4/5, worth the money I paid, I guess.  I had to pay twelve dollars for him and Nuhrii.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
