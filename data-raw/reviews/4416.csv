"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-03T09:32:41Z","Awesome","I personally as an action figure and brick LEGO lover, say that this is awesome. His disc launcher is awesome, I shot Takua with it and he fell off my bed!
The masks are multicolored (as most of as know).
Action Figure Collector:
Pros:about half the height of most figures, making it look more like a Matoran
Cons:Poor posability, no back

LEGO collector:
Pros: Includes old Technic peices
Cons: Very little peices, takes about 2 minutes to build, no original LEGO pieces except for those mentioned above, no LEGO trademark look.

I got this for X-mas, it makes a good stocking stuffer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The got packed away in the big box before i had a chance to build them. So When i was browsing here and saw them I thought &quot;gee wish i had bought them&quot; You can  only imagine the shock i got digging through my box and found not one but 6 unopened boxes of models i said i wanted days before.

Anyway here's my review. Personally i like them. They are a great addition to the bionicle story and help build great army's to reinforce the toa in battle. The disk launchers are good for short or long range but could have a little more power in the firing mechanism.

The only real flaw is they have no backing but i haven't found this makes them any less poseable.

Overall I rate these guys a 7/10 and although they look very similar i would recommend getting all six to build you collection up.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-09T15:19:10.873Z","Matoran revolution","The pieces are cool, including the body, used as armor in some creations. The mask is a noble mahiki with awesome painting, a silver and white. The little arms and legs can be fingers for titans. The head have dark color, and the eyes, a translucent light blue. The kanoka glows in the dark, and the launcher launchs very well. The feets are of the bohrok, good for matorans in growing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
