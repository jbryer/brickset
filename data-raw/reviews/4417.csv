"legoguy2805","2008-01-15T13:41:07.81Z","only 3 peices!","This set is really just a random Kanoka Disk launcher with two random Kanoka Disks. I got a Po-Metru Launcher with a Ta-Metru Disk and a Po-Metru Disk. A good set if you're in need of more ammo. Basically all there is to review.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2008-02-13T16:36:08.043Z","extra disk launcher ammo","I got this set for my birthday in 2004 along with Tehutti and Ehrye. I also bought one on sale at 
K-Mart. Well onto the pros. and cons..

    Pros.
       disks
       thing that attaches disk launcher to the Bionicle
       disk launcher
       launches well

    Cons.
       don't know what disks you get

Overall buy only if you have a Bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-15T17:06:59.733Z","Good Ammo Option","I rate it 4/5. Basically, it is from who need ammo. But it can come with repeated disks, that happens to me, coming with two onu metru disks, and a red launcher. Overall good reposition of ammo, for matorans, toa or vahki. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2008-09-30T18:33:28.45Z","Nice Kanoka Pack","The only downside is that it gave me 2 Onu-Metru disks and a brown launcher, considering that I don't own Ahkmou, so this is only an extra disk pack for me.
Pros:
2 disks
Launcher
Pieces to hold launcher to hand
Cons:
Only 2 disks
Totally random, so sometimes you get 3 of the same colored launcher.
Get it if you want extra disks and launchers, but it's not really worth 5 bucks or 3 bucks.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"wadaltmon","2008-12-14T12:00:03.56Z","More and More Ammo!","This set isn't an actual model, but it is great. I got about 3 of these, and I got a green launcher only- the others didn't come with a launcher! Faulty! But, then again, I got LOTS of disks and I hope you try to find one of these somewhere- an awesome one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Cligra","2011-08-24T17:41:53.843Z","You get what you see...","Well, as the title says, you see what you get. This set contains a few of the highly collectable Kanoka Discs, and a launcher. Not the most thrilling set, but better then its equivalents in later years (such as set <a title=""View full details of set 8748: Rhotuka Spinners"" href=""../../detail/?Set=8748-1"">8748</a>). Not the most interesting set, but nice enough if you collect Kanoka.<br>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,2
