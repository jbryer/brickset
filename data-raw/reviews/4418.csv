"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-06T20:08:03Z","Vahki Nuurakh","The Vahki are sort of the police force of Metru-Nui. THese things aren't as tall as Toa Metru (unless they stretch their legs and stand on their toes maybe), but they outsize the 2004 Matoran greatly.

Their heads are very complex objects, consisting of a disk launcher mouth, a very large semi-opaque eye piece, and a small colored skull. They can fire disks, but I like to pose them without them because the disks flop around and drop out alot.

Although the old Toa weapon arms are used, what would be a con is overcome by the new tools. Their claws/staffs are HUGE. By far one of the largest single Lego pieces in the Bionicle line. They extend the arms 2.5 times loonger when added to the old Toa arms, and they're awesome to pose with.

The Vahki can switch between bipedal and quadripedal stances, giving them twice the possibilities for play.

The only cons are the disks not being stable in their mouths and lack of variation (but who cares?). Aside from that, perfect sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-27T13:27:48Z","Nuurahk","Call me biased if you want, but this set exceeded my expectations through and through.  These guys literally put the Toa Metru from earlier this year to shame.  I'd have to say they're some of my favorite sets of six to be released in the entire line so far.  (Yes, I prefer them slightly over the much-beloved Rahkshi.)  The dual staffs serve as great weapons and forlegs, and their 'spider mode' is brilliant.  The disk launcher in the mouth works quite well, firing the projectile a good distance while not being an overly-huge part of the head.  If there's one flaw, it's that the 'eyes' are too far back and on the side of the head, making the little indents in the head piece more eye-like.  (That doesn't really matter to me, though.)  Of the six, Nuurahk is my favorite.  His staffs are the best, both looking cool and able to support him when flat on the ground (like in the cover image), and the new dark-red color for this year goes very well, making him vibrant and menacing in a dark way all at once.  If you get any Vahki this summer, get Nuurahk first.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<h4>Overall:</h4><p>This was a great set. It involves some Technic parts, making the arms swing. It contains great weapons, which allow the model to walk on 4 legs, like on the picture. It contains a semi-transparent green head shield, which makes it look great! If you are unsure of how to fold it into the 4-legged form, the steps are in the building guide. The set contains a red Kanoka disk, which is fired from the Vahki's jaw. It is not shown in the picture. The only con is that it falls over easily when it walks on 2 legs, and posing is a bit difficult.</p><p>Overall, get this set.</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;""><br></span></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3
"xboxtravis7992","2019-09-27T02:58:10.893Z","Dr. Strange Vahki: Or how a 25 Year Old Man Learned to Love the Bonk","<p>On a whim one day during a Bricklink purchase I&nbsp;bought this set Nuurakh and one of its sibling sets the white Keerakh&nbsp;on a whim. I had two Vahki sets growing up that I got back in 2004, the black Rorzakh and the blue Bordakh&nbsp;so I was familiar with the line already; but for nostalgia&#39;s sake I felt this sudden urge to grab me some more...<br />
<br />
Now a few Bricklink orders later and I have the green Vorzakh almost complete now, and will eventually pick up set #6 the brown Zadakh down the road. What was it about these 15 year old sets that drew me back to them on the secondary market all these years later?<br />
<br />
First off, its always hard to explain the appeal of these early Bionicle waves to those who judge Lego sets off their builds. A Modular Building this ain&#39;t... all six of the Vahki&nbsp;share a clone build, the only differences being the two exclusive staff pieces and the coloring of certain parts. Many early Bionicle waves were like this, the early Toa, Bohrok, Rakshi and Matoron almost were all similar sets with very little differentiation. The Vahki took that to the logical extreme, repeating the build across the entire wave. It wouldn&#39;t be until 2007, and not really fully embraced in Bionicle until the 2015 reboot that the sets really broke from the clone build model.<br />
<br />
But the clone builds all share a same commonality, playability. Early Bionicle was great at playability, and the Vahki has several basic play features that are a blast to mess around with. The two arms are on central gear, allowing the body to swivel back and forth. The head has a built in disc launcher, placing a Kanoka disk into the launcher and squeezing launcher will toss the disk out a fair distance. Lastly the models show on the box art and other canon Bionicle sources the &#39;variable geometry&#39; of the Vahki. Much like the Bohrok and their ability to roll into a ball, the Vahki have several poses that represent different play features. They can walk on all fours (like Nuurakh in its boxart), walk on their two hind legs, or place their legs flat with their staffs to their sides into a &#39;flight mode.&#39; Its simple, but it captivated my imagination as a kid and is still fun to tinker with as an adult. The cloned build also helps in collecting, get a few of these and its easy to imagine them as an army of mooks to face against Toa heroes. Get one color of each, and you have a nice rainbow sample of figures not to disimilar from the trend of collecting monochrome minifigures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Packaging is also awesome in early Bionicle. I got this from Bricklink, and the seller had preserved several original features of the packing, including the original plastic canister and the cardboard &#39;Kanoka Club&#39; card that came with the set. The Kanoka Club codes are useless with the website gone for over a decade now... but are a nostalgic blast to see inside the can. With Lego&#39;s push for AR integration with themes like Hidden Side, I am surprised they haven&#39;t implemented something similar to the Kanoka Club in modern sets. I don&#39;t know if Christian Faber and Advanced were involved much in this wave of Bionicle, but his touch is still very present in the packaging and product presentation.<br />
<br />
Of course, they&#39;re cheap used on the secondary market... meaning building up an army of these guys is rather affordable. Its a great blast of nostalgia from the past, and with the plenitude of online used Lego shopping options now available now is a great time to dip toes back into collecting the old Bionicle sets. I&#39;d recommend this set to those looking for some fun nostalgia from the mid-2000&#39;s.&nbsp;<br />

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nuurakh comes in a canister with it&#39;s picture on the front, and info on the back. The instructions are a small booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts in this set originated with the Vahki, and were put to use for most of the last 6 years of BIONICLE. The head can fire a Kanoka disk when you squeeze the sides.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Vahki are easy to build, with the only complex parts being the arm swinging function and assembling the head.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Nuurahk is an menacing red, silver and green robot ready to track down criminals. The arms swing when a gear on the back is turned, and it can &quot;spit&quot; disks. The Vahki can be folded so that they can crawl on all fours.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;I highly recommend this set.</p>
