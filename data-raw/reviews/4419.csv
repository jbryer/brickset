"Gus_263","2008-02-23T17:50:13.373Z","One of the best","Things that are awesome in this set are some. But, one of the most are the colors. The head strange piece have orange color, very cool in blue. The color of this piece is in the toa metru eye color in another scheme. The weapons are long blades. The two are very long, and the vahki can shift to bipedis to quadrupedis. Cool features!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:45:47.403Z","This is bohrok all over again...","As with the bohrok, these guys all share the same exact design, so the opening statement for all 6 will be the same as well. All Vahki have new Bionicle parts (...yay...) and a new feature: they can walk on two legs or four (...yay...) but unlike the bohrok, there really isn't anything to collect except for the colored parts and weapons (...yay...). The Vahki have a gear system allowing their mid torso to swivel (...yay...). The Vahki also have a disk launcher (...yay...) with a different disk for each color (...yay...). 
Still pretty boring since all are the same (...yay, hey wait a second!)

This vahki has a better color scheme, but the weapons are cool, swordlike things, but not very scary. Vakama gives it a 5/10...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-20T17:12:32.623Z","Surrender or Run!","This Vahki is just like the rest. The Vahki I think were better than the Bohrok because, the legs were a lot more pose-able. I got this without the kanoka disc, so I hope I can can get a Ga-Metru kanoka sometime. The staffs of loyalty look very detailed and cool looking. The designers must have wanted something complex, because the main torso consists of nine pieces and the head has six pieces. The arm moving function makes it look like he's running.

Pros:
Cool staffs.
Complex design.
Great function.
Can go on all fours.

Cons:
none.

A great set to play around with. Get it, if you can find it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2010-01-20T21:46:46.64Z","My latest addition to my Bionicle collection...","I helped a 7 year old friend to build back a lot of old Bionicles from some pieces people gave him, and in return he gave me this guy, and even though he wasn't complete, my Bionicle piece collection finished him.
Bordakh is really neat in his color scheme, and his Staffs of Loyalty look pretty dangerous.  The disk launcher, as always, works fine with a matching Ga-Metru disk I found for him, and it shoots pretty far.  Like the rest of the Vahki, he can twist himself around and turn into a four-legged crawling mode.  His arms can swivel back and forth from the gear system inside.

Pros:

+Neat weapons
+Color scheme
+Disk launcher
+Good ole gear system
+Fun to play with
+Great collectible

Cons:

-None!

Final rating is 10/10, and I don't think he could have gotten any better.  Great Vahki!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-05T10:31:28.353Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Vahki) - Bordakh Review","<p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has a great amount of blue pieces which are very useful for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8615-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the feet, the legs and the head can be adjusted. If you want to shoot the disc you have to push the mouth of this vahki and if you turn the gear on the back you'll move the torso. You can also put this figure into a crawling position. I really love the design of this figure and the weapons we got with this set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
