It includes four figures and a ghost, so that helps build your army if you want to create one.  The Wolfpack set is a nice idea because there are only two other Wolfpack sets.  The boat is nothing special really but the archer's round target is a pretty nifty piece that has come in handy for some Castle displays I've built.  Recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
