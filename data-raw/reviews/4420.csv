The set can shift to bipedis in quadrupedis. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:48:09.043Z","This is bohrok all over again...","As with the bohrok, these guys all share the same exact design, so the opening statement for all 6 will be the same as well. All Vahki have new Bionicle parts (...yay...) and a new feature: they can walk on two legs or four (...yay...) but unlike the bohrok, there really isn't anything to collect except for the colored parts and weapons (...yay...). The Vahki have a gear system allowing their mid torso to swivel (...yay...). The Vahki also have a disk launcher (...yay...) with a different disk for each color (...yay...). 
Still pretty boring since all are the same (...yay, hey wait a second!)

This vahki is my personal second favorite, with a great color scheme, and pretty decent weapons, though the claws don't move. The claws appear to look like tin snips, which in a world of metal is pretty scary, so Vakama says: &quot;give it a 9/10&quot;",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The arms however, I love the most. And by the way, if you're wondering what happened to the Metus I used to own, I gave it to my brother (a.k.a. vezon8764).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-02T21:37:11.53Z","Dude Vahki!","No, this is not rahaga369 ( AKA: barraki2046 ) as my title may suggest. This is good old Kiwi Carl reviewing another brilliant Bionicle.

Pros:
Nice head
Cool shooting action
Snippy weapons
Spinny
New legs
Green

Cons:
NONE!

As some people already said, all the Vahki have the same design but I have to say I don't mind that. As long as its a good design then it's OK having six the same. This is yet another fantastic set and is a must have for everyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-04T06:02:02.643Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Vahki) - Vorzakh Review","<p>This is a cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 28 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has a lot of cool pieces which you can use for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure. I really love the weapons for this figure and we also get a disc which glows in the dark.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8616-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. If you push the mouth of this vahki you'll be able to shoot the disc and if you sviwel the torso you can put this figure in a crawling position which looks very nice, too. I also like the design of this vahki.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
