The brown body and the dark blue head piece, makes brilliant opposites of colours! Plus, must enter the Kanoka Card Code, and watch the 'Exclusive animation'!

The eye piece is blue, combining so no much than orange in the brown. The blades are very cool, used in a combination (feature of the blue, white, and this, the brown vahki) The mouth is a  great disk launcher, including the po-metru's kanoka. The playability is very well and include features ! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legoguy2805","2008-09-21T14:09:34.67Z","Zadakh, Vahki of Po-Metru","My Neighbour got me this from a car boot sale yesterday. The Vahki were robots created by Nuparu, One type to guard each region of Metru Nui. The Zadakh were the Vahki of Po-Metru. All the Vahki were controlled by Dume. When Teridax disguised himself as Dume, the Vahki belived he was the real Dume. (This is why the Vahki were 'evil' in 2004.) All the Vahki were destroyed by the Visorak.

Pros:
Kanoka Disk Launcher
Staffs of Suggestion
Cog system
Good Colour Scheme
Stands up well

Cons:
None!


Overall, a brilliant set, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:50:12.607Z","This is bohrok all over again...","As with the bohrok, these guys all share the same exact design, so the opening statement for all 6 will be the same as well. All Vahki have new Bionicle parts (...yay...) and a new feature: they can walk on two legs or four (...yay...) but unlike the bohrok, there really isn't anything to collect except for the colored parts and weapons (...yay...). The Vahki have a gear system allowing their mid torso to swivel (...yay...). The Vahki also have a disk launcher (...yay...) with a different disk for each color (...yay...). 
Still pretty boring since all are the same (...yay, hey wait a second!)

BORING, the colors are pretty ugly...

The weapons are better used for hanging laundry than for feirce fighting. I couldn't scratch myself with those, let alone fight. Vakama is to busy sleeping to give this guy a 3/10!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2009-02-23T23:47:15.997Z","VAHKI USED TO COME WITH VAHI!","It's true! I went to a Safeway in 04, and there, arranged in neat rows, were the latest and greatest of that time: Vahki, the law enforcements in Metru Nui. However, there was something better about the Zadakh in this store: they came with a special edition gold Mask of Time and orange Disk of Time! The only other reason I bought this set is that this is the only Vahki set that has axles on both sides of the staff. However, there are a few bad things about this set. In the Mask of Time pack, you don't get the Po-Metru disk and the Disk of Time with the set, and I don't have a Po-Metru disk yet. The last thing is that this is just the same as all the other Vahki, with the staff being the only independent thing about it. Other than that, I'll still give it a 5.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-06T10:23:26.71Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Vahki) - Zadakh Review","<p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This figure has the same amount of 32 pieces as the other vahki we get. I don't remember the price of this set when it was on sale in Germany but I think this set is worth the money. We also get a lot of good pieces for future MOC's and/or brickfilms and we also get a disc which glows in the dark.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to complain about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8617-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the legs, the feet and the head of this figure can be adjusted. If you push the mouth you can shoot a disc and if you turn the gear on the back you can sviwel the torso. I also like the way how you can put this vahki into a crawling position. The design of this figure is really cool and I also like the weapons which we get with this set.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The brown is a really excellent shade.<br></li><li>-The new blades are cool, and are definitely individual.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The lack of armor in this set is disappointing. <br></li><li>-This set is also all too similar to other Vahki sets.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a good set, especially at the price that I got it at, with great weapons and a great color. I recommend this if you don't yet have a Vahki in your collection.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
