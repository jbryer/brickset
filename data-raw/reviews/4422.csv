Torso: Matoran/Rahkshi torso with a new piece too. i dont like the idea of re-using the rahkshi torso style again.
legs: An unplated toa metru leg is at the top and a new piece is at the bottom. the upper leg needs plating because it looks too slim. lower part looks like baggy pants. the feet are toa feet. nuff said
arms: dangit! I hate those arms. hardly usable and ugly. I feel sorry for the Vahki for havin these arms (thinks about trying to play video games with those arms)
Staffs: SCHWWWEEEEET! the staffs are awesome

Spider mode: looks cool but turnin a head around is creepy *thinks toy story and the saying from it &quot;we toys can see everrrythingggg!&quot;*

The features are some, like the capability to shift in quadrupedis, the gear systems that makes very cool moves, the disk that can be launched in the mouth, and different weapons. The color scheme is another stuff. These eyes(different to other onu beings of 2004)glows, like the  vakama eyes( but the piece is different.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

All Vahki have new Bionicle parts (...yay...) and a new feature: they can walk on two legs or four (...yay...) but unlike the bohrok, there really isn't anything to collect except for the colored parts and weapons (...yay...). The Vahki have a gear system allowing their mid torso to swivel (...yay...). The Vahki also have a disk launcher (...yay...) with a different disk for each color (...yay...). 
Still pretty boring since all are the same (...yay, hey wait a second!)

This Vahki is just as bad as the brown one. Okay the colors make up for the tools, but that thing is more of a jackhammer than a weapon. They are bulky, dull, and better used for walking sticks. Vakama is too embarassed to even say this hardly deserves a 4/10!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Pros:
good colour scheme
neat staffs
can turn from a biped into a quadriped
disc launcher in mouth
decent price
fair amount of pieces

Cons:
Please, tell me you're JOKING.

This set is a great one, one that has playability written all over it.
It really looks like a lean, mean, law-enforcing machine. (Which it is,
in the BIONICLE story-line.) If you happen to find this set at a good
price, it's definitely worth your money, and is an excellent addition
to your BIONICLE collection. The color scheme and appearance is exceptional, and makes for a set that is a joy to display.<br><p>&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building Experience:</span></p>
The relatively easy build is one of this set's few flaws. Of course, a
six-year-old might need the instructions, but an older fan could
probably put it together just by looking at the picture.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts:</span></p>
This set is a quite unique style, and combines an aura of mechanical
menace with a surprising number of parts that could be swallowed by
three-year-olds. Unfortunately, not many of these part are even
remotely rare, with the possible exception of the twin Staffs of
Presence and the glow-in-the-dark Kanoka Disk, which my set is missing.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability:</span></p>
Ahhh... This is where this set really shines. The legs are sturdy and
posable, and the solid build can withstand most drops onto the cement
basement floor. The head is very robotic-ish, with small rectangular
eyes, and a disk-launcher mouthpart. The set is very sleek and has a
distinct aura of mechanical menace, no matter what the pose or
surroundings are. There is only one fault with the playability that I
can find, which is that the four-legged mode is absolutely the only
pose that can possibly make this 'bot look bad. When in this mode, it
looks like a pot-bellied, tiptoeing, cyborg cow. If you want to display
this set, which I greatly recommend, please do it a favor and put it
into two-legged mode first.<br><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for Money:</span></p>
I got the parts for this set for free, but if you can find this set for
around $12.99, it's definitely worth it, 'cause for collecting or
playing, displaying or MOCing, this set is one of the best!<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">For more on information on the Rorzakh, visit </span><a href=""http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Rorzakh"">http://biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/Rorzakh</a><br>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
"ArchOnua85","2021-10-30T00:37:48.457Z","One Review For Them All","<p>You&nbsp;better treat this review as not just for Rorzakh, but every Vahkis because asides from colours and lore, they are virtually identical. I just picked this one because I am diehard fan of the earth element, otherwise why would I have this username. But what about the Vahkis themselves?</p>

<p>The assembly itself is nothing to be surprising of a Bionicle set, the regulars of course. Naturally, if you talk of the vehicles, they have a lot more parts and their building experience is more positive, but generally speaking, it is more of the same for all of them and the Vahkis are&nbsp;no exception. 3 out of 5, as it is average.</p>

<p>Perhaps a&nbsp;Vahki&#39;s best place to shine is the playability. While projectiles became a staple in the later years, in 2004, if you wanted your character to use projectiles, your choices were very limited outside of some expensive vehicles (which now got even more expensive like everything), some McDonald toys (but who would collect&nbsp;this?) and a single Metru hero. All Vahkis also had that gimmick where they could go from biped to walking on all four. In a lore standpoint this makes sense and makes Rorzakh the best Vahki by default because it is the one Vahki that shall make the best use of its&nbsp;features to climb traverse whatever areas regardless of its&nbsp;landscapes while doing its&nbsp;role of dooming the city under the pretext of enforcing the law. So far sounds familiar. 4 out of 5.</p>

<p>But where it suffers the most is the value. Now from a collector standpoint, this does not matter because your primary goal is to collect them all no matter the cost, but I think I should point out that it has been years since the days of the affordable classics are gone. So if you value your bucks, or your dollars, based on&nbsp;who you are, maybe the Vahkis are not your first option. 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>Overall, the Vahkis are a fine set. I am not telling you to not buy them, definitively own at least one of them to complement your Metru Nui collection. If you absolutely need to own them all, go ahead. But if you are in a budget and want to collect, just own one because they are all the same.</p>
