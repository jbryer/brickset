What am I saying if you got the money buy all the Bionicle sets there all cool iv read reviews on a lot and there all cool.  This guys blades are cool and you can flip his legs and head and arms a round to make a monster thing. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-15T17:12:44.59Z","Cool vahki enforcers","One of the coolest of 2004 sets, like other vahki, can transform in bipedis to quadrupedis. It have good colors, and the blades are useful, used as blades or wings, like i use in some creations. The blue part of the head makes a awesome color combination, and th disk launcher launchs very well(5/5).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:54:49.483Z","This is bohrok all over again...","As with the bohrok, these guys all share the same exact design, so the opening statement for all 6 will be the same as well. All Vahki have new Bionicle parts (...yay...) and a new feature: they can walk on two legs or four (...yay...) but unlike the bohrok, there really isn't anything to collect except for the colored parts and weapons (...yay...). The Vahki have a gear system allowing their mid torso to swivel (...yay...). The Vahki also have a disk launcher (...yay...) with a different disk for each color (...yay...). 
Still pretty boring since all are the same (...yay, hey wait a second!)

Yay a decent vahki! This one is moderately frightening and has a great color scheme, plus serves as a cool camoflage in the barren arctic. The weapons are awesome, serrated, and deadly. An actual threat. Vakama prouldy gives this one a 9/10, ALMOST forgiving the other identical, yet terrible Vahki.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-02T23:22:39.997Z","My favourite Vahki","The Vahki were always my favourite villains because they were robots and they could turn into quadripeds, and Keerakh was my favourite Vahki. I like his serrated staffs and the colour scheme. (White Bionicles have the best colour scheme, but green Bionicles have some of the best designs.) It's also good to have all of these so you can collect the Kanoka disks. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"I_like_Lego","2009-08-01T09:21:28.717Z","Vahki want hands! No spear thingy.","The name of my review was just a joke so people would read it.I got this from someone before my birthday and i was young (and i thought it came with: Bionicle 2 legends of metru nui) so i built it,but for my birthday i got another one and i opened that one to just a two weeks later.

Pros:)
.Disk
.Spear thing
.Legs
.Body
.Head
.How it can go on all fours
.How it can get in the box
.Light blue piece
.White arms
.White legs
.White body

Cons:(
.The white piece that moves the arms when you turn the gear is broken
Overall 10/10 good set.It must have been popular because another company called LEQI made the same set as this but it was made out of cheap plastic and $6 cheaper. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tkettle9719","2011-12-31T12:15:02.677Z","The Vahki best served cold.","<p>I had originally gotten this set for my sister for Christmas because she soon got into Bionicle. Years later, she had said that she didn't want the set anymore, and so she gave it to me. Here's my review:<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The ridged sword is really cool.<br></li><li>-The Kanoka disc is easy to use and flies far.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The whole body is similar to all other Vahki.<br></li><li>-The set has a somewhat low piece count, meaning limitations on armor and overall design.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>I like the Vahki, but this is a great example of how Bionicle, in the early stages, had many similar-looking sets. Buy this if you don't yet have a Vahki, but don't spend a lot.&nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-06T10:13:26.76Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Vahki) - Keerakh Review","<p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 40 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>As all of the vahki this set also comes with 32 pieces. I don't really know how much it was when it was in the stores but I think this set is worth the money. We get a lot of good pieces which are very cool for future MOC's and/or brickfilms and we also get a disc which glows in the dark.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8619-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. On the back you can find a gear which you can use to sviwel the torso of this figure and if you push the mouth you can shoot the discs. The design of this vahki is very nice and I also like the weapons for him. I also like the feature how you can put this figure into a crawling position.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
