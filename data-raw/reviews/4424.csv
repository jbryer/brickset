Did anyone else have one like that? as a kid it was hard to build at the time but I liked the rack and pinion steering. I kept rebuilding the other optional models but without the motor as I didn't have that. Lost a lot of the parts now as I also tried using normal Lego to turn it into a rally car for the figure like a Peugeot hatchback...<div><br></div><div>It led to my getting the following Xmas the chopper, 3 pack of figures and the Snow Ranger the following year!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,5
