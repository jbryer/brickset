Turaga dume also uses the same body of the matoran of metru nui(the body looks like a armor). The nivawk is his rahi, have good wings, maded with vahki blades, hooks as claws and a great designed head. The legs are short to a great titan. But nivawk can leave the turaga perfectly. I rate it 5/5, this is a playable, well designed and very cool set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-14T13:45:48.733Z","Dume, Turaga of Metru Nui, and his pet Nivawk","I got this off Bricklink for &#163;7. You can make Dume ride Nivawk but he never does in the story.
Nivawk is a type of flying Rahi which are called Nivawk.
Dume is a Turaga of Fire and he is the leader of Metru Nui.

Pros (Dume):
Good Colour Scheme
Stands up well
Noble Kanohi Kiril, Mask of Regeneration

Cons (Dume):
Exactly like a Matoran of Metru Nui but with Bohrok limbs instead
Doesn't have a Firestaff like in the movie

Pros (Nivawk):
When you press the sides its wings spread out
Stands up well
Good Colour Scheme

Cons (Nivawk):
Can't put its wings into any other position

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 64 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some really cool pieces. We get lot's of black and gray pieces and we also get a nice mask piece for Turaga Dume as well. All of those pieces are always great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8621-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p>This set has some cool play features: The legs, the feet and the head of the creature which Turaga Dume is riding can be adjusted. The wings can be moved, too. There's also a place in the front of the creature where you can keep Dume. The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head of the turaga can be moved as well. I really can't complain about this model.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-15T19:01:42.97Z","Metru Nui's Leader","<p>Turaga Dume and Nivawk is probably my least favourite Titan/Warriors set. Despite the cool function the set has, and the inclusion of a good Turaga figure, this set really loses me when it comes to Nivawk. From major balance issues to pieces falling out at random, there are multiple components of the larger build that I don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Turaga Dume:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: Metru Matoran torso in bright red and an awesome looking mask in red &amp; black.</p>

<p>Can ride Nivawk.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poor movement (Metru Matoran build).</p>

<p>Torso is flat and hollow looking from the back.</p>

<p>Nivawk:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts: Rubber insert pieces in legs and&nbsp;blades on the wings are new parts.</p>

<p>Good movement in legs.</p>

<p>Custom head build looks great.</p>

<p>Wing function is good and works very well.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Awful balance despite the wide foot design. If Dume is attached, the set can collapse under its own weight.</p>

<p>The set is very hollow from the waist up. Only the head and legs look complete.</p>

<p>Toes and knee blades frequently fall out.</p>

<p>Neck movement isn&#39;t the best.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, even though I don&#39;t really care for this set, I&#39;d still somewhat recommend it. Turaga Dume is a good build, and despite how unbalanced Nivawk is, the wing function is enough to save the set. If you want a cool avian creature or a Turaga to add to your collection, check this set out.&nbsp;3/5</p>
