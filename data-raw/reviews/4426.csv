"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-04T13:02:48Z","this is a good set.......","    ok. first, let me get this out of the way first. the only reason
i am giving this set a nine instead of a ten, is because it could have some extra pieces to make it more sturdy, otherwise, this is an
awesome set. on to the review.
   
    nidhiki is a well-built and looking set. the snaping bohrohk eye
on his elbow is very nice. so is the idea that he can transform from
sled mode to scorpion mode to normal mode. his claws are pretty good
too. but i think thay should have used dk.grey instead of silver 
staffs of light.

    the head of nidhiki is nice. just like a vahki head, but on the vahki, it looks too big, on nidhiki, it is great. the body is nice
too. it is well built. you really don't realize when it is done, though.

       overall, nidhiki is a mean, lean, toa killing machine. for any
bionicle fanatic or any collector, it is worth your money and your
time. so get yours today.....

It has a Vahki head and a crab sort of shape. Oh, its disk is just a regular Matoran disk, not some &quot;new&quot; disk like some people think.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-24T10:57:52.577Z","A  dangerous Dark hunter","Nidhiki is an titan of 2004 and also one of the best bionicle. Its color scheme is awesome, including silver, green and black. Nidhiki's four legs are no much playable, but are done to representate an &quot;insectoid&quot; character, that really looks like. His arms are so playable (more than his legs) but not his claws. The disc launcher is like the vahki sets, on his mouth, not so good but considerable. The body is good builted but no much playable, like the legs. The Bohrok shield is an good armor for the body, due to the design and the shape. I rate in Overall, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-31T18:22:23.53Z","Totally Sweet","Yup, this set is sweet. And guess what, I got it on sale. Well, onto the review. This set is packed with functions. The claws snap open and shut. The legs also do the same. You can even transform this guy into a crab like figure. If you do not have this set, you should get it. Also, very cool pieces that are useful it you take it apart. 10 out of 10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2010-01-02T13:43:30.047Z","Who's the biggest, baddest, meanist Dark Hunter out there? NIDHIKI!","This set is totally Awesome! I agree with everyone who posted a review on this set. He is big, Complicated, and TOTALLY AWESOME!! He has snapping claws and like VoyaNui36 pointed out he has three ""modes"". He has good parts and is packed with fun.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-05T07:43:41.083Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Warriors) - Nidhiki Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 64 pages and there're no mistakes in the instruction.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has some very interesting pieces like the head piece which LEGO used for the vahki figures. There's also a disc included in this set which glows in the dark. The pieces are great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><h4>The build</h4>The build is very nice and easy and I also didn't have any missing pieces. There're also no stickers included in this set.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8622-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the claws, the legs, and the head can be moved. The head has a nice disc launcher which shoots very well. The claws can be opened and/or closed very nice and easy as well. You can also sviwel the legs very easily, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"fair_use","2016-07-31T01:23:11.923Z","Great set, but not perfect","<p>As with all of the 2004 titans, Nidhiki is not perfect, but has so many&nbsp;good features&nbsp;that make up for it. Overall the build is not as entertaining as some of the other sets of the year&nbsp;but it is still a very interesting and functional set nonetheless. Not to mention the ability to flip the pincers open and closed are fairly unique to Nidhiki, as the same with the flight capabilities. If you flip the head backwards, you can fold the top half down to give him a crouching feature, which does give him a more menacing look like in Legends of Metru-Nui&nbsp;back in 2004. Overall Nidhiki&nbsp;is a great set,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Pincer function</p>

<p>Flight mode</p>

<p>Crouching feature</p>

<p>Disk launcher</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Heavy arms</p>

<p>No unique head piece&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not as easy pose</p>
