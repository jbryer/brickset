Krekka's head is really good builted and designed. The body is also an innovation but not much playable. The arms are small and like the old sets no playable like the new sets, but with some good weapons. The Krekka's legs are different of his arms, so playable and are innovations to the titans sets, including it's feet. Another feature is the disc launcher with the po metru disc and good positioned on the set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Cignal","2009-06-29T17:57:03.293Z","One of the best."," This is truly a piece of hardcore LEGO-engineering. I don't understand why people don't like Krekka. Sure, he's not so aesthetically pleasing, but he isn't like that in the original motion picture ""Bionicle 2"", where he's rough, tough and pretty dim. He's also missing right eye and in LEGOs box art he appears to have 3 eyes! Two normal glowing yellowish aren't supposed to be eyes!

 Krekka is also as a set very close to his movie-self and Bionicle-team has made a great work in the pursuit of recreating a movie character. This blue Titan class monster truly represents all that Krekka is supposed to. 

 2004 was probably the best year in Bionicle, when functionality of the models was at the top. Technic was big part of a Bionicle toy. 
 
 Nowadays Bionicle figures are very simple and their whole point is to ""look good"". That wasn't the case in the first good years of Bionicle line. Fist Bionicles were marketed as ""action figures"". Now they're more like ""Barbies"" without that high-tech appeal like Krekka, Nidhiki and other old sets have. 
 
 Krekka is still my favorite Bionicle set and without a doubt a must-have for any LEGO enthusiast. Sure, he has some flaws, but as a whole he's well thought model. His arms could've been same, I just can't figure out why TLG decided to make arms different. They also need armor and more points of articulation. But, designers did what they could with the limited amount of parts they had those days. 

 Recommended for anybody interested in LEGO. Krekka has the best of both worlds - Technic and Bionicle.

"DarkHunter94","2010-06-10T17:02:09.687Z","Truley Brilliant","<p>Ok guys if you dont know&nbsp;krekka was released along side Nidhiki and Turaga Dume &amp; Nivawk in the summer of 2004. All three of them are titans. Krekka is a dark hunter which is a group of hunters associated by the shadowed one. anyways onto the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Krekka is quite a big character. he is very armoured which makes him great when it comes to combat. krekka is seen as dumb. i dont think he is. krekka isnt the smartest but atleast he has the intelligence of how to finish somebody off. ever woundered about that red thing. thats krekkas right eye. although on the box he is pictured with 2 yellow eyes oh well wierd. he has a vahki weapon and a rahkshi weapon on each of his hands. but in the film he just fights bare handed. krekkas main weapon is the disc lancher on his shoulder which is activated by flicking a switch. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Krekkas upper body is pretty compicated. its not really a bad thing but well its complicated. krekkas head is on a ball joint which can rotate fully around. his feet are much different than his arms. his feet are extremly armoured and well protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over all i will say krekka is a fantastic character. he is my favourite bionicle of all time. i would deffinatley recomend this for all bionicle fans</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: it took me about an hour to build krekka his body like i said is pretty compicated but the rest isnt as complicated thanks for reading ;)</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4
