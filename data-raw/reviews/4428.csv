I think my parents were surprised that I managed to build it completely on my own from the instructions.  (I don't recall building any models before this.)  I think my dad bought it for himself. :) I had a big thing for helicopters back then (Airwolf, anyone?) so I thought it was pretty cool, especially how the main rotor and side rotor rotated simultaneously from one control.  The yellow landing gear looks slightly overused for the two models, but I think it was a pretty slick model back in the day.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
