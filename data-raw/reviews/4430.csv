This set is very interesting because you could make two models which one was a really good base, and one which was a really shady vehicle. Both models are unique in some way and Lego did that perfectly. This one gets a 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

For the very first time, Lego introduced a line-up of technic sets that were designed to create a separate sub-theme. Former sets were rather loosely bound together, e.g. 8845 and 8846 were a good team.<br><br>Moreover, the 4 arctic sets were the first sets that contained the technicfigs. It seems as if playability gained higher importance.<br><br>Back to 8680: it was the biggest of the 4 arctic sets. As it's name states, it's the base of all arctic activities.<br><br><b>Parts:</b><br>We get lots of snow-white technic bricks, two technicfigs and pneumatic parts. In fact, this set is the 4th and last that contained 1st generation pneumatics.<br>All other parts are rather standard, but the amount of big gray and white plates is very useful for creating every kind of MOCs.<br><br><b>The model:</b><br>It is just a square box. The red helicopter pad can be lifted using the pneumatic cylinders, the white ramp can be opened and closed. Finally, the base can be moved around because the yellow skids are equipped with wheels.<br><br>As a single model, 8680 isn't very exciting. But in combination with 8620, 8640, 8660, the base makes sense. And don't forget about the pneumatic parts :-)<br><br>Unfortunately, Lego never expanded the arctic subtheme by adding 1 or 2 more sets. I guess it could have been worth a try.<br>",TRUE,3,5,4,5,4
