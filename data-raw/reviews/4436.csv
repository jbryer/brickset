I found them useful for my Technic creations which needed drivers or operators. You could turn them into skiers as well that was cool. Of course you could do that to minifigs as well...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-05T00:33:41.797Z","Here Comes Your Man","If you liked the Technic figures that aren't made anymore, get this set. There are 3 figures in the Technic form with a wrench and a chair also included. They are very useful in Technic sets today and should be still made. These figures are fanstastic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aqualize","2010-01-07T06:18:40.327Z","The good complement to many older technic sets","At least a few technic set of the old days had a chair but often people didn't have anything to put in them and that is what these guys are for.
I don't think they are good for making up scenarios and playing with them (like lego minifigures) but more for decoration. I don't remember playing to much with mine but many of their joints are very loose, so they may wear quite fast, so that's the minus about them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rpell","2012-12-23T15:35:36.907Z","Crash test dummies","<p>I had these three bought for me when I was a kid and building technic lego kits. They basically acted as crash test dummies for when you attached a motor to a lego technic car that you made, a little bit unfair that they only had one seat between them and only two crash helmets. The guy with the seatbelt on his front was, of course, the best technic lego figure, and he would be the test pilot for most of my creations whilst the other two would attack the lego pirate fort like over-articulated giants.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Gave lego technic vehicles a driver</li><li>Umm, they could kung fu fight each other better than normal lego minifigures</li><li>That's it really</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I lost the torque wrench on Christmas morning circa 1990 and have never seen it again</li><li>Lego technic doesn't really lend itself to mini-figures</li></ul>",TRUE,2,1,4,5,3
