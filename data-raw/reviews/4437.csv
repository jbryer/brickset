"MetroiD","2009-01-11T18:54:17.45Z","Useful for Technic builders","Finally something to help you work out the exact dimensions that your Technic car needs to match in order to be a bit more realistic! I had a suitcase full of Technic bricks but my creations always lacked that final element which was supposed to give them that extra bit of realism... And voila, there you have it - the big three!

These guys will fit perfectly in most Technic models and are also a great reference to build by. Since their heads, hands and legs are quite agile compared to a common minifig (stupid as that might sound), they can also be used in a wide array of situations, ranging from riding a motorcycle to holding on to the hook of a lift truck for their dear lives!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-08T10:33:46.397Z","LEGO Technic (Supplementary) - The LEGO Technic guys Review","Actually there's nothing much to say about this one. This set includes 3 'minifigs'. I won't really call them minifigs because they're much bigger than a regular minifig. What I think it's interesting is that these guys can move and tip their heads, legs and arms like a human. The regular minifig which we use to see is not able to do that. Another thing which is different between those figures is that you can't take the heads, arms, hands or the legs apart. The only thing which can be taken apart is the helmet. And on the heads of these LEGO Technic figures you can also see some hair which you also can't take off. What's also different between these figures and the regular minifigs is that you can see that the Technic figures got a nose and ears. These figures are great to have but I don't think they'll fit in the LEGO Technic vehicles which we got these days...<br><br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
