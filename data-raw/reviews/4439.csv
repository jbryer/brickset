"asianlego","2008-10-01T23:17:48.793Z","Power to the Pieces","This set is great and there is a motor, battery box and a remote control (which is not wireless unfortunately) but was great for its time. There are also a lot of gears and holed bricks and also a wired brick which connects the motor and remote. I used to power up my Technic buggy with my friend's 9V motor set.

"Aqualize","2010-01-07T06:26:16.81Z","Good addition if you are playing","Some kids enjoy a lot more the playing with than the build of the technic sets. Here is where this comes in because many sets had supplementary instructions how to add a motor if you had one. I write _add_ because often it was just hinged on and lucked ugly, not integrated like with some modern lego sets which uses the ""power functions"" set. So if you like to use your model for display this is not necessary at all because quite a few models (especially the cheaper ones) only used this to drive the wheels, not so funny. If you own some sets, look into which can use this motor for operating a technic function of the model, that makes it funnier to play with.

"Proteasome","2013-07-30T19:16:37.487Z","this bring back awesome memories","I really loved the 9V motor set. I actually had 2 after a while, which made it even more awsome! I used to place two motors next to each other, add a wheel, put the cables together, and I basicly had a remote controlled car! it did not look like much, but it was really coola s it could mare 360's and stuff, and this set made it happen. and it also has been used in nearly all of my lego sets. (by the way, the second one i got with a second hand red super car, 4884 i think, so that was cool). <br><br>But one thing i really dont want to forget, is that there are building ideas in this set for your own creations! and good instructions on how to build the technical part. Of course the new motor was better and stronger, but i still really like this one. I dont own any of the new power functions, but I'm not really attracted to them, for without studs, in doesnt really feel like lego to me. (the main reason i'm not really interested in the new technic sets, although i own most of the big old ones. <br><br>I would not get it now, unless you are into old technic sets and you own some with which you could use them, by all means, get it!<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4
