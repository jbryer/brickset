"vanurk","2005-05-19T08:50:16Z","more for less","yes, this is really a great set !
you get a lot of technic parts including
a motor, a remote control, and much more
you even get a book in it for motor-ideas for a helicopter, a kart and a heavy shovel

perfect ?
no... the price is still to high (20 euro)

"grepin","2008-05-08T17:58:52.793Z","Motor is problematic","As was mentioned by unicodemaster787, this set's motor clearly was poorly designed.
I got one for Christmas in 1997 or 1998 but had to return it to the store because the motor was dead. They had another one there, but that set's motor was also dead, so I remained without a Technic motor until I bought a 8720 online.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"VWBeetle1626","2010-04-03T15:35:28.623Z","Good motor set","<p>I don't know, why people don't like this motor. I think that it's good and it can work for a long time. </p>
<p>In this set we have a lot of gears, for example: one gear 24 tooth, two gears 16 tooth and three gears 8 tooth. With the building instruction and bricks included in this set&nbsp;we can build three other transmissions.</p>
<p>It is one of the best motors, and it is cheaper than Power Functions motors ;-)</p>
<p>Goraco polecam!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Ape_Fight","2010-01-03T14:09:55.327Z","Dead motor no.3","I bought this as a bundle with the 1997 Sahara Blaster (shown in red on the box) and the motor worked great with it. That said, I have three of these motors and one is jammed solid. Not the most reliable thing Lego has ever made, the older motors were much more reliable.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
