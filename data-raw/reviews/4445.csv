The shield is NOT plastic, it's CARDBOARD!!! The torso is one big piece with a few of the small racer fronts added. The head looks awful witout the helmet on. The knob on the back to activate the sword-arm looks just like - a knob (not incorporated into the design as the Bionicles). I can't compare to Galidor, as Galidor was never sold in Denmark, but the joints are not Bionicle - as a matter of fact, there is not one single Technic piece in this set. Comes in a &quot;castle&quot; container a bit like the dinosaur containers. Conclusion: Bad all over.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-10T15:00:29.733Z","Danju, knight of the wolf","The action figures of knights kingom looks like the same, with colors, details, weapons, shields, the helmet and some pieces differents. This is a action figure but without being different of lego. Looks like more lego than galidor, having original bricks and too a yellow face(it isn't necessary), but likes very be lego and a action figure. The danju character is included as minifigure in playsets. The colors are strange for a knight, purple, yellow and gray. Wolf is a great symbol for one knight, and makes the set more cool. The shield is made to like a shape of wolf's head. The sword is compatible with some lego, later used in exo-force. He have a gear system, to makes different moves, and it looks like be lego, and a  action figure as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-18T13:24:59.647Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Danju Review","This figure is cool to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet, the head and the visor can sviwel and on the back of the torso is a lever which moves the arm which has a sword in the hand up and/or down. The other hand has a shield but it falls off very easily if you touch it. But the figure is still very easy to maneuver for sure.  As I told you in the beginning:  It's a nice figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically you get the main body/torso and limbs to pop in for the ""build"", sword and a card board sheild. The head just looks eh without the helmet being down. It's fine if you want to set them around to pose, I just highly regret having gotten these in the long run.</p>",TRUE,2,1,1,2,2
