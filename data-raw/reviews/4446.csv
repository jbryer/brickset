His sheild is a cardboard like material FOR PROTECTION OF SMALL CHILDREN! I think everyone should buy this figure along with his comrads.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-25T20:33:31Z","Very Cool ","I like this idea MUCH better than the Bionicle or the horrible Galidor line.  Though I would prefer actual sculpted heads, and the actual body pieces are a bit too generic for my taste, it's a great figure for a great price (seriously, the only other action figures with that much articulation on the market today for the price are the Toy Biz Marvel Legends).  Also it's Lego, so if you don't like some of the armor or weapons, you can customize it whatever way you like.

The Action feature left a bit much to be desired, and is it just me or does the body piece look like a rejected race card body?

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-20T21:33:06Z","Jayko of Talonjay","Jayko is a great set. I like the color combination. His sword looks great, and his shield is aerodynamic. In other words, its curvy. The helmet is also &quot;form follows function&quot;, in which case I mean its aerodynamic also. Why am I blabbing about aerodynamics? well, Jayko's power is speed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Theres not another Kinght in all Morcia who can match my speed and quickness. Sure, I have yet to earn the title of Great Knight, but its just a matter of time. And my time is now!&quot;
Great set, i love the colours and the smoothness when you swing the sword . Cool shape to the sheild and the hawk looks so bold with its spread wings and head turned to the side.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-12T13:11:24.327Z","this realy isnt good","this isnt realy that great. hes not detailed, his helmet is pretty plain and the only printed brick on his body is his torso which has a gear on the back to make his arm move up and down which looks dumb because his arm stays totaly strait. the sword is ok, but has no use other than for him, and his sheild is terrable. when you look at in a picture it looks like a solid thing, but actualy its a peice of cardboard stuck down by one stud as you can imagine, it doesnt stay on to well. this set is not worth anything and has no point of buying it, i dont know why i even liked them.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-06T13:30:49.31Z","Jayko, Soaring Hawk of Talonjay","Now Sir Jayko, which according to the KK2 comic is the youngest member of team and is often the one causing alot of trouble. He also learns fast from his mistakes. Apart from the minifigs he is here representing the province of Talonjay in his full glory of.. light.. blue..? A weird color for an armor, if you ask me. The shield is great, however. I did not like these 'action figure' LEGO but I give this a 4 for great design especially the shield.

"Hedgehog87","2009-06-28T17:18:26.03Z","I rememeber this set","This was one of the knights i owned

pros: the sword and shield are pretty cool, and i prefer these kind of pieces to bionicle pieices, it makes it looks more realistic.

cons:It doesn't always have the ""lego"" feel although it isn't as bad as it could have been (compared to galidors)

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-18T13:30:21.783Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Jayko Review","This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play and to maneuver with. The build is very easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet, the head and the visor can sviwel and on the back of the torso is a lever which moves the arm which has a sword in the hand up and/or down. The other hand has a shield but it falls off very easily. As I told you in the beginning:  It's a nice figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically you get the main body/torso and limbs to pop in for the ""build"", sword and a card board sheild. The head just looks eh without the helmet being down. It's fine if you want to set them around to pose, I just highly regret having gotten these in the long run.</p>",TRUE,1,2,1,2,2
