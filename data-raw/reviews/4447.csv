The one piece body - this would have been better with a number of shaped pieces held with technic pins, I can see why Lego did this but the piece is not useful for anything else at all.
The shield - Its not great but is not just thin card, its plasic covered and fairly hardy. Not to useful....

Good things about these knights:
Lots of funky curvy detail pieces in a good variety of colours and the leg and arm joints are useful strong jointed pieces. I can see some good imaginative possibilities with these leg pieces and they are a good addition to Lego in general.

His sword is long and it's yellow color looks good with his shade of green. So in closing, you DEFINATLY should buy this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Oh, and for those who don't know, here is every knights kingdom people:

Rascus, the Joker
Vladek, the Evil
Jayko, the quick
Danju, the wise
King Matthias, the important
Shadow knights, the possessed
Santis, the strong.

The sets are meant for younger kids, so please don't say &quot;too juniorized&quot;. I wonder why...?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-12T13:12:55.64Z","my favorite out of these guys","this is ok, i like him better than the otheres but still. hes not detailed, his helmet is actualy pretty good and the only printed brick on his body is his torso which has a gear on the back to make his arm move up and down which looks dumb because his arm stays totaly strait. the sword is ok, but has no use other than for him, and his sheild is terrable. when you look at in a picture it looks like a solid thing, but actualy its a peice of cardboard stuck down by one stud as you can imagine, it doesnt stay on to well. this set is not worth anything and has no point of buying it, i dont know why i even liked them.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-12T13:47:11.153Z","The first Rascus ","The first action figure of the green character, rascus. Knight of the monkey(the symbol is strange) is the knight that most looks like a real knight, have a well made helmet and colors, like the green and yellow details, that make thinks he live in the forest. The sword is cool, yellow, and the shield too, have a monkey design. Like another knights, he is an action figure(in great sets he is included as minifigure) and it looks like lego more than galidor, have great bricks, can moves with the gears on body's back and moves like action figures with legs and arms.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-06T13:36:00.06Z","Rascus, Monkey Guardian of Banteras","Rascus here looks as green as usual either from the comic book or his minifig self. His shield has a monkey emblem on it and somehow looks vaguely familiar (possibly from a college fraternity's logo). I agree with the other reviewer on this set should have Technic parts for the body. This set is the 'action figure' set and would not appeal to many people unless you like displaying.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-19T10:11:15.22Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Rascus Review","This is my first knight figure I got and I'm really glad that I got it. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet, the head and the visor can sviwel and on the back of the torso is a lever which moves the arm which has a sword in the hand up and/or down. The other hand has a shield but it falls off very easily if you touch it. But this set is still easy to maneuver and to play with for sure. It's a nice figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically you get the main body/torso and limbs to pop in for the ""build"", sword and a card board sheild. The head just looks eh without the helmet being down. It's fine if you want to set them around to pose, I just highly regret having gotten these in the long run.</p>",TRUE,1,2,1,2,2
