Actually some darn good pieces in the arms. The joints should be good for mechs or mecha, and the detail pieces should be good for any number of things.
The sword is a very cool shape, and would be good for a Bionicle MOC, or again, mecha.
The assembled figure is pretty darn posable. More posable in some respects than a lot of Bionicle. (Lets see the Toa Metru spread their arms that wide.)
Mine came with an extra trans radar dish, which is always welcome.

Cons:
That shield. It's not even a particularly sturdy cardboard. I ended up taking it off entirely, and moving the sword to his right hand.
The torso, despite having a good number of connection points, is useless as anything but a torso.
The visor won't connect to anything but the head, which stinks.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

But if you like knights then this is for you but if you think that knights are weird then thats your oppinion. I give this set a 6/10 ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:14:31.967Z","Galidor - Red","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  Santis is the red one.  His action figure includes a rather intresting match of red bricks with grey highlights that makes it look like a walking fire truck.  The beige bits that are thrown in also makes the figure seems rather weird.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-05T14:10:09.14Z","wierd and not very detailed.","i would say that this is my least favorite of all the kk figures. hes not detailed, his helmet is so plain and the only printed brick on his body is his torso which has a gear on the back to make his arm move up and down which looks dumb because his arm stays totaly strait. the sword is ok, but has no use other than for him, and his sheild is terrable. when you look at in a picture it looks like a solid thing, but actualy its a peice of cardboard stuck down by one stud as you can imagine, it doesnt stay on to well. this set is not worth anything and has no point of buying it, i dont know why i even liked them.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-12T13:57:12.09Z","First santis","This is an action figure from lego, of the knights kingdom series, cool because it is an action figure made with lego pieces and looks like very be from it. The red, santis, is the strong of the story, have red color and a great sword. He also can moves the arms (or only one arm)with systems(gears or only pushing the body) in the back of the body. The helmet don't looks like be from a real knight, but still good. Another thing that makes this set like lego is the yellow face, yellow like the minifigures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-06T13:38:40.967Z","Santis, Mighty Bear of Orkosan","Sir Santis here looks absolutely great in his red outfit and gives him a regal look of a prince, possibly he is the Prince of Orkosan province. However his shield has a picture of a fuzzy bear which looks ultimately juniorized and makes him look less brave. This set should appeal to kids who like 'action figure' types.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-19T10:06:50.377Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Santis Review","This is a very cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet, the head and the visor can sviwel and on the back of the torso is a lever which you can use to move the arm which has a sword in the hand up and/or down. The other hand has a shield but it falls off very easily if you touch it. But this figure is still very easy to maneuver. As I told you in the beginning:  It's a nice figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
