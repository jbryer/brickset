I give this a 2 because it have some rare parts. I think LEGO have competitors like Action Man and try to do some action figures theyself, but if they do so they not make LEGO any more.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

Vladek's Scimitar looks very wicked. The pointy pieces on his armor make him look very evil. I like how they gave him a helmet so you could see his whole face.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I don't like the action figures that they made, but me brother does. He also got the castle one, which I'll be reviewing later. I have got so say, though, it has some rare parts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lewa_rocks","2007-04-26T16:17:46.107Z","This is pretty cool","This is a cool set but I give it a 8/10 but I think the other knightt from 2004 are only a 7/10 because this one has the coolest sword. The sword is good for MOCing with Bionicles. If you like this set then I recomend getting some Bionicles. Over all he is the coolest knight from 2004 because his mask and sword.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-12T13:15:11.59Z","hmm.","this guy was my favorite at the beginig but hes not now. hes not very detailed and all his armour is so bumpy and sharp, his helmet is wierd and the only printed brick on his body is his torso which has a gear on the back to make his arm move up and down which looks dumb because his arm stays totaly strait. the sword is the best out of all of them but still not that great, but has no use other than for him, and his sheild is terrable. when you look at in a picture it looks like a solid thing, but actualy its a peice of cardboard stuck down by one stud as you can imagine, it doesnt stay on to well. this set is not worth anything and has no point of buying it, i dont know why i even liked them.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-12T14:18:56.06Z","Vladek, villain of the series","Only he is the villain in the series, he and the shadow knights, never included in action figures. Is a bad thing for the storyline, but with this set you can imagine somethings for make a new. It looks like lego, an action figure and building toy in the same time. The colors are awesome, red, gray and black... The face is yellow and is easy to see it. The armors are compatible with some lego themes, and another parts, of the arms and legs are great, being used later in exo-force and creator. Every child is capable to make creations with this, and some will think that it is cool. The sword and shield too are compatible with bionicle and technic. I think that the knights' kingdom lines are great, the great sets are better than the new castle, and the action figures are very better than the galidor. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-18T13:11:51.87Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Vladek Review","This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The legs, the feet, the arms and the head can be moved and the visor sviwels as well. On the back of the torso you can see a lever which can move up the arm which has a red sword in the hand. The other hand has a nice looking shield but it falls off very easily.  As I told you in the beginning:  It's a nice figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically you get the main body/torso and limbs to pop in for the ""build"", sword and a card board sheild. The head just looks eh without the helmet being down. It's fine if you want to set them around to pose, I just highly regret having gotten these in the long run.</p>",TRUE,1,2,1,2,2
