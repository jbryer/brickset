"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-18T14:01:44Z","Nice little set","I bought it when it was already on (a little) sale. The figs are good. The face of the purple knight is nice and Vladek is great. It's also for years one of the first set with a normal horse in it. The thing to throw stones to vladek could be better. It's a bit overprized. I have now all 4 knights and 2 vladeks.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-26T13:24:01Z","There's nothing to dislike here","For the reasonable price of €8,50, this set features two knights, one horse and one catapult. The purple knight seems to have to fire the catapult at Vladek, who will fall off his horse then. This is a good small set to get the bad guy Vladek, and the Wise Veteran Danju. And he looks like a great knight, who had many exciting adventures when he was young. Vladek looks pure evil, with his black and (dark!) red tapestry over his horse... pure brilliantness! The purple color looks a bit off, but after a while it is really funny. I actually like new colors for armour at last ,and the patterns on them are...well..cool.
In all of my honesty I tell you, that you can't really dislike much about a small set, which has two reasonable minifigs one can use, and a fully-armoured horse. Sure, the catapult is crap, because it doesn't fire very far anyway, you should remember these sets are GREAT playable for kids!
Really, do you guys call yourself LEGO fans ? When you ask TLC what they're doing becuase you hate it so much, I suggest you just don't buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T21:56:04Z","purple armor.","it is a very good set for horses and barding, unfortunately it has danju the purple man and that is thhe worst thing about this set.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T12:02:07Z","Very nice","I bought this set yesterday.  It is actually a pretty decent set.  I was skeptic about the new Knight's Kingdom sets.  I finally picked this one up, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The horse armor is very nice, as is the catapault.  It may be better than the old Knight's Kingdom catapaults in sets such as 4816 and 6032.  Vladek(the black knight) is very intimidating, and has a slight &quot;Sauron-in-armor&quot; look about him.  The purple knight was the one of the four I was the most doubtful about.  However, I was really pleased.  I am straight, but I still think that purple is a cool color.  The purple knight I think looks downright awesome.  So why am I rating such a cool set at an 8?
Exactly because it is hardly a set at all.  If the price for this was $5.00 USD, then I'd say it's a pretty good price.  However, for the $10.00 USD I payed for it, I'll only be picking up this one copy.  Very bad price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-19T07:26:40Z","What's not to like? HUH?","Nice set. I like Danju, he's me favorite, Vladek is okay, but not the best. Knight's kingdom rules hard, man. Or woman. NO ALTERNATE MODELS! I hate it when they do that.

HORSE:

Okay. NOt as good as the grand tournament horses. THere is a part to fill in the gap between the horse's body where a mini-fig could sit, so when you can get off, It goes on, but iit scares me.

DANJU:

Best minifig...

Vladek:

Okay.

Catapult:

Works like a-da-charm...

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-20T21:50:09Z","Well.","I believe all the Minifigure sets of KK are overpriced. Oh well.
The catapult is nice. Good firing range. Good figs, especially the awesome armor. A good little stocking stuffer for KK fans this XMAS.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T16:22:00Z","there's nothing wrong with this set at all..","This set is fine. Although a bit overpriced, it's perfect. The catapult can fire very good. It goes fine and far. Danju is cool, I like the armour. Vladek and his horse is okay as well. There's nothing much bad about this set at all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T17:53:20.903Z","pretty good.","this set is pretty good, it includes danju (hes pretty rare) and a vladak. the horse's armour is cool and the ctapult works great. i dont think its wrth the money if you compare it to the final joust (the new castle sets) which is the same price. so i would buy the final joust instead of this one unless you realy want kk sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-03-05T18:06:39.123Z","Worthless","all of these so called &quot;knight's Kingdom&quot; sets are too unrealistic. knights with greem, blue, purple, and red armor? How colorful and childish! there's nothing realcly wrong with the sets themselves, except, of course what I mentioned above. a catapult with rocks. how interesting!what happened to the old castle sets, which actually had an inside to the castle? Luckily, lego hasn't made these sets in a while, and have been replaced with the more detailed castle sets.  ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-02T16:45:20.31Z","Shooting in vladek","This is a scene of knights kingdom. This set have a well made catapult with the knight danju, without a horse shooting one piece to vladek and his horse. The helmets were made to looks like with their helmets as action figures. The symbols in the shield too, don't in the correct position, but larger and cool in the same time. The catapult is little, the system is basically push to shot, is well made, including the common gray color, useful to any seets, with black little plates and the base of the place to shoot pieces. In the image appears two little pieces to be throwned, the two can be used in many forms too. The colors of the knights are great, purple and yellow or black and red, same of the horse and it's armor to combine. Vladek don't have a shield here, in a place of it, a spear of the jousts. The helmets are great, like of the racers theme pilots, but in the place of visor, the helmet shape of the knight. The playability is basically play with the minifigures and the horse or other additions like the weapons and the catapult to launch in one of them. Due to the size, this set is awesome, is packed in box, where is showed information of the product,the set is well made and detailed. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-14T10:53:33.14Z","One of the best KK battle scenes","I got this for AU$5 and I must say for that price it is well worth it, considering the are cool minifigs with cool accessories and a full dressed horse. Danju's helm is very useful even if you try to create a futuristic scene. The catapult isnt that good and is just a simple contraption. If its on sale, get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-14T12:12:38.64Z","Let me count the flaws. Um... Um... Can I get back to you?","What I am saying is that there aren't any. This set is the perfect little stocking stuffer come Christmas. (Which, if I remember correctly, is how I got it.) This is a great, cheap little way to get Danju, Vladek, and a horsie. I like the small catapult, and it can go to great use as a siege weapon if you still have. The only problem I can think of is that I've lost most of the pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-26T18:35:43.17Z","Handy little set","If anything, it's an army builder.  But if you count the other things, you understand why I rate it a 5/5.  I no longer have it, but I remember how far the catapult hurls the rocks, and how fun it was to battle Vladek with Danju.

Pros:

-Catapult (good army builder)

-Minifigs are good

-Horse and gear

Cons:

"AETerry","2011-04-03T00:40:44.18Z","Vladek Encounter Review","<p>A small set from Knights' Kingdom, I don't recall exactly what I paid for it originally, just that as a smaller set, they're easier to pick up and grab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know with Kingdoms, the individually named Knights and their enemy Vladek intrigued me with a individual personalized and colored armor to tell them apart... almost like Lego Power Rangers in a way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get Danju? Purple Knight with the wolf emblem and then Vladek on horse back with some very cool looking barding for his horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catapult build is alright and functional. I have seen far worse for these designs and I've also seen somewhat better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Kingdoms series first came out that when I'd realized I had a lot of other Castle sets, so many of the newer ones that have been coming out have been feeling redundant when I look at them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only because I'm older and have been collecting since the 80's though I'm sure the sets coming out that are newer do just fine for younger generations getting into Lego.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,4
"Ernst","2012-01-29T18:18:31.013Z","Vladek Encounter, 2 good minifigures with a doubtfull catapult","<p>Overall 3 bricks: a reasonable set with 2 nice minifigures and a strange catapult. Because it is a nice addition if you own other sets of this theme and the price&nbsp;I give 3 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 2 bricks: the only thing to be built here is the catapult of 15 pieces, putting the minifigures together I call assembling so 2 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks: the&nbsp;4 bricks are a reward for the present minifigures Danju and the Shadow Knight with horse and blanket. Definitly missing is the elastic band for the catapult although it shoots this way too. Some more effort for a better catapult would have been nice. Sufficient weapons for both minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks: looking at this set without prejudice it is very playable. You have&nbsp;2 opposite Knights and a catapult and you can use it with all other sets so 4 are in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks: for a decent € 5,00 I got this set which is a nice price for its content. On Bricklink you find an average of € 8,55 which is a bit high in my opinion, I think € 6,50 would be better.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,4
"AxelN1","2011-05-02T10:36:04.807Z","Cool small set","<p>DESIGN:</p>
<p>This set has only one little model: catapult. It's design isn't too bad. I like the Vladek's design and the pattern on horse armor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PARTS:</p>
<p>This set doesn't have a lot of interesting parts, but has a great horse armor, special to this set. It has also two swords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MINIFIGURES:</p>
<p>This set has two minifigs: Vladek &amp; Danju. Those minifigures have cool faces, but i hate non-printed torsos!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLAYABLITY:</p>
<p>You may play a battle between two warriors,using a horse and catapult. I think this set is very playable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:</p>
<p>8777 is a very good small set. If you have found it in good price, buy it.</p>
