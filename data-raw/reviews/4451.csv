The base is two long green plates loosely connected. Horrid design. The little gatehouse is hideous, and the design on it stinks. 
However, the bridge is nicely made, and the minifigs are just plain...AWESOME with a capital A.

I wouldn't pay 20 bucks for it, but get it at a discount when you see it.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-21T20:21:48Z","Border Ambush offers enough fun to wet your Knights' Kingdom appetite.","I picked up Border Ambush mainly because who can deny the rather unique look to the bridge. Here's a few things to know: #8778 includes two minifigures - Santis, the Red Knight and also the Strong Bear and a Shadow Knight under Vladek's command. It's always good in my mind to have a Lego model with a scene, a few tricks or traps, and at least one good guy and one bad guy. Border Ambush provides all of these things. As for the tricks/traps, there is a little lego Soccer/Basketball launching pad that allows Santis (and you) to throw a boulder, which is provided, to knock the Shadow Knight down into the second trap or off the platform completely. This second trap is nothing new - a trapdoor which can be activated by pulling out a little rod with a handle that will send the Shadow Knight (or Santis if you wish) falling into the scorpions' den. Finally, the bridge, which reminds me of a board game called Forbidden Bridge (probably never heard of it...) is actually very fun. You can hang a minifigure by the side vines, pose them on the shaky wooden slats, or take Santis over them as you play. So, in the end, it's a good model - not the best in the world, but a definate must for Knights' Kingdom lovers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-25T20:26:45Z","Is this even Lego...","It looked cool in the catalog, not in reality. I was building a CLASSIC CASTLE similar to one of the early 90's. I wanted to bolster my supplies of castle elements. BAd idea with this set.

Pros
- five spears+ axe
- bridge ropes
-shield

Cons
-lame minifigs
-color change? I noticed that the elements are tinted brighter than the old sets. They dont blend!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T22:06:25Z","shadow knight!!!","it isnt that great other than the fact that it has so many spears one axe and a shadow knight. quite unlike he looks in the pictures, santis is a very unatractive red. the new sheild designs are great, but the emblems are'nt that good. it was surprisingly unsuper juniorized but it was'nt that unjuniorized. it is an okay set and I think that every castle fan should get this set because it is probably the  most unjuniorized set in this castle line.

"mrmitch","2007-06-08T03:20:05.17Z","Solid set - bridge is big reason I picked it up","Currently this is the only recent Knights Kingdom set I own. It was on sale(a plus), I like the bridge and the rock, you also get two mini figs with the set. Not perfect but would be good addition to any Lego fans collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-07-17T09:00:23.967Z","Give me the key....... or get hit by a bolder!","Dug this one out of my most recent box today and had a little play. I would have to disagree with any notion that this knight is hard to hit i can get him every time and i was not ever a fan of the sports series with these launchers so i have had no previous experience with them.

Well for a knights set i was pretty happy with it. This bridge is exactly what the ninja series needed. I remember making my own out of toothpicks and string. Love the catapult thing. I had mates come round that were drinking and couldn't stop laughing that this red guy lifts a boulder the size of him and knocks the baddie out. (I know they were drunk but still very funny.)

The instructions were nice and clear and the story in the back added to the experience. A couple of improvements thou, firstly the base plate is pretty poor. I mean it makes no difference unless you want to move it but still, seems like were getting stooged again.

The key....? It needed to be like better secured or in a hidden lock box or pressed into the wall or something! Just hanging there just seems lazy.

The final thing I would like to point out is the bridge isn't meant to have all the slats. Its old, busted and a definite trap. Its not meant to be easy or possible to cross.

Overall I rate this model a 9/10 only cause I find it funny and it is pretty good money for value.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-04T14:07:45.797Z","The Border Ambush","this set is one of the knights kingdom sets released in 2004. Not much small like the &quot;Vladek Encounter&quot;, another set of this theme, released in the same year. This set includes two minifigures, the knight Santis and a shadow knight. The santis minifigure is simple and nice, with a good red color and some itens like the sword, the shield with the symbol of bear in the two sides and the helmet, based in the helmet of the snatis action figure, of te same theme and year. The shadow knight is also simple but nice with the color scheme, some details on the body, a helmet and an axe. The building involved in this set still above the green plate and is made nicely with useful pieces. On the plate, there are some plants and on a side, there is a stair. Above, there is a little tower that is connected to the other with a bridge that still cool altough have on each side a cord that makes it still in a good position, and makes an effect on the playability, it looks like to be on a earthquake. The other side have another tower, more complete, with a little chamber. The small gray blocks are good builted and inside the chamber of the tower, there is a key. All the pieces are useful, this set is too good builted for a small and have a awesome color scheme. The playability is not the better, but it can increase some other sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"icelus","2008-04-19T21:12:20.373Z","Interesting concept, shoddy implementation","The concept is pretty cool--a perilous bridge and a scorpion pit.  There are some useful individual pieces to this set, but as a whole, it leaves much to be desired.  As reported by a previous reviewer, the design does not allow one to reach the top of the bridge from the steps.  Ditto the single piece used to secure the two large green baseplates.

If you're a completist such as myself, I don't really regret this purchase, but for a more casual LEGO buyer--save your money.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-24T20:03:46.123Z","First KK Set","Even though this was my first Knight's Kingdom set (I still have it to this day, by the way), I must rate it a four.  It's just lacking something.  First of all, it only comes with three scorpions.  Second, the trap door isn't big enough for the Shadow Knight to fall through easily (you have to help him through with a push if he has his axe in his hands).  Otherwise, it's an okay set to play around with.  I mean, what kid couldn't like playing around with a strong knight hitting an evil knight on the noggin, and then scrambling across a rickety bridge to get a key?!?  Anyway, Pros and Cons are:

Pros:

-Santis and Shadow Knight minifigs

-Rickety bridge with green Spider Man ropes

-Trap door

-Scorpions

-Spears

-Tree

-Throwing mechanism

Cons:

-Only three scorpions

-Shadow Knight can't fit through trap door with his axe in hand

-You have to hold the green 2-by-6 in the middle to keep the whole thing from splitting when chucking the boulder

Overall, okay set if you wanna collect.  Otherwise, get into Bionicle, everyone's favorite LEGO theme! :D",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ET","2009-06-24T23:56:37.763Z","Awesomeness","I think that this set deserves a 5/5 solely because of the bridge. The design is just cool, with two green Spider Man vines stretched across a pit of scorpions- this set is just to cool.

Figures: Santis is okay, but you can get him in nearly all of the other sets. The Shadow Knight is cool, and you can never have two much of him. Then there's three rare scorpion. Love the scorpions, baby.

Pieces: You get five arrows, a soccer kick stand, a rock raiders boulder, a SILVER key, two fire pieces and some plants. This is great if you are looking for rare pieces.

Pros:
Santis
boulder
scorpions
BRIDGE!!
shadow knight
arrows
mountain
sweet key

Cons:
Not roomy
the tree falls off ALL THE TIME
if you buy a lot of Knights Kingdom sets (like I did) you end up with a whole ton of shadow knights heads and bodys that you don't know what to do with

Overall, 10/10. This is an awesome set. Score one while you can.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-07-15T11:18:47.62Z","Border Ambush : strange but original.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : Another surprising KK II set, not the best of Castle sets but very original and playable, besides that you get several usefull parts. Allthough original a little strange, hard to imagine a Knight throwing a rock this size, would be more realistic without it. On the other side for younger owners it's fun to throw things. Nice for collectors, for others not a must-have set. Set is used available for a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks : The set is fun to built, starting with the small building where the key is hidden. Several small bricks and a big rockpart hiding a room with scorpions. The first floor is small ruin with a trapp floor built with small bricks and arches. After that you built the other side with a small catapult that enables Sir Santis to throw the big rock. The middle part is the ropebridge under which you place several spears as a trap. The overall result looks nice and works as it is ment to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 3 bricks : no really spectacular parts but not bad either. The 2 minifigures are nice, allthough I still don't like the bright colors of Santis &amp; Co. I can't help thinking that&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Knights' Kingdom II"">this theme</a> would have been more appreciated with normal Knights.&nbsp;Other usefull parts are the big rock, the big amount of spears, the golden key&nbsp;and the parts of the ropebridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty 4 bricks : for the younger Legofans this has great playability. The set has 2 opposite Knights, a lot of weapons, a throwing mechanism&nbsp;and 2 traps and a treasure being the key. For the older fan more a collectorsset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : The <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=8778-1"">Bricklink</a> average show some €15,00 for this set which is ok in my opinion.</p>
