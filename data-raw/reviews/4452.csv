"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T16:19:36Z","a 2 people player set!","I don't find the horses having wheels is weird. Its not weird at all because if they didn't have wheels, how could they charge? This set is really good for 2 people because you need 2 people to slam on the slammers to make the horses jelst eachother. I really like the secret spot under the king's throne. It's really really cool!! The only problem I find with this set is that it's overpriced. It's too exspensive.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Hylocera","2012-07-07T21:02:56.1Z","Playability! Pieces! FUN!","<p>I got this set a long time ago, and I don't remember much besides it working well and being good scrap for other sets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Parts</strong></p><p>This set had some nice parts, like the plastic horse heads, the 3 minfigures, and the unique color schemes. The giant shields were nice too, but the one I got didn't come with either...anyway, there were also double-sided flags (scorpion one side, lion other) and a good amount of coins under the king's throne. Overall a good selection of rare/cool parts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Playability</strong></p><p>What was really cool was that you could sorta change the colors (via some spinning plates) on the bricks in front of the throne to show the winner. They were light blue on one side, maroon on the other. Winning would involve slamming the jousting things, which worked surprisingly well. A light blow from a 6-year-old could send horse and rider several feet. If placed correctly (directly opposite each other at a distance of approx. 1 foot), the joust usually ended with&nbsp;a minifigure on the ground; if not placed correctly, you would end up with a pair of horses at least 10 feet apart facing away from each other. With a little bit of careful placing, this set could easily result in several hours of contests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p><p>I believe this set was priced something like $29.99. That being said, it was really worth the money. Besides being a well-designed, elegant piece, the parts used were also practical for making your own creations. Unfortunately the set came with brick-built horses rather than standard&nbsp;LEGO horses, but&nbsp;I doubt the system would've worked as well&nbsp;with said horses. The minifigures were also well worth it, with good armor pieces, and pretty amazing shields.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a really great set, and if you can still find one intact, I would recommend getting one. Unfortunately, I don't have any other Knight's Kingdom sets, but from what I've seen a combination of sets from that theme would look picturesque in a diorama. I hope this review helped!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Ernst","2011-12-27T15:49:11.1Z","Nice Tournament set, but good if it had normal horses.","<p>Overall 3 stars: the sets from this theme, although&nbsp;all a bit overdue,&nbsp;deserve a better Tournament set than this one. All goes well until you get to the horses, I really can't understand why Lego did not add normal horses instead of the silly slammers. Maybe the younger fans like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience 3 stars: it is not hard to built, the small castle where the King has his place looks nice and the 2 slammers aren't very difficult too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts do get 4 stars: if there had been real horses instead of&nbsp;slammers &amp; ""horses"" on wheels it would have been a big&nbsp;5. Still 4 now thanks to the amount of present weapons and the big banners that give the set something extra. Also the the torches and small flags are good accesoires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability&nbsp;3 stars: reviewing it neutral it would deserve maybe more because of the&nbsp;precense of the&nbsp;slammers. But I also add or distract the disappointement you get when you hit them too hard and they fall into pieces. Beside that&nbsp;reasonable playability. Maybe it deserved an extra star for the optional way of building it, a small castle attacked by a catapult. I found the picture on Bricklink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money 3 stars: Bricklink gives an average of â‚¬ 15,00 if you buy it second hand which is in my opinionenough money for a set which is a bit disappointing in my point of view.</p>
