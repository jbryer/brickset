-Even a child(like my nephew) notices the stupidity of putting the drawbridge mechanism on the outside.

-the vine climbing doohickey looks like a good idea(turn cogs and get a pole-carrying minifig to climb), but doesnt actually work.

-Two traps cancel each other out the spinning axe wheel tends to decapitate the giant snake.

-this castle might make more sense if its an obstacle course that fits into a story line, but if thats the case, it leaves even less room for the imagination.

On the plus side, it has a stained glass window!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T15:48:51Z","yuk!","i agree with everybody that the boulder is on the wrong side do the rainbow guys run in the castle and let the bad guys trap them inside or something? this isnt a castle since it provides no protection to the knights overall a meaningless castle. lego should do what they do best and make sets from the 90s,80s,and 70s",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-09T20:26:41Z","Wow.. uuhhh...","well i seriously think the whole idea of the castle is cool, and i like the little traps ( except, how do you put boulders on the ENEMY side of the drawbridge to raise it for THEM?) honestly.. i also think the vine idea is Great!
However, i think there should be more time spent, i have made castles similar (and in some cases better) than this one... all it is is a bunch of arches, pillars, evil snakes (fall out of potter world??), and some FREAKISH knights, wearing barbie armor and dancing like girls....
whatever, i probably will pick up this set, though! LEGO, Please Release some remakes of classics (like falcon fortress or old forester sets- they were great!)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T22:20:31Z","just got this one.","this set is extremely juniorized.heres my list of the pros and the cons.(by the way the reason that the drawbridge mechanism works from the outside is because to get the magical sheild of ages the knights have to get through four challenges of skill.)

PROS
shadow knight!
it might not look like this to you but the gaurdian has the best torso!
two knights.
huge weapon assortment.
CONS
two traps(the serpent and the axes)dont work together.
jack stone peices.
rascus has a printed torso.
pretty much boring other than the traps.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T13:29:15Z","A good set","The set has lots of playability in in.(Snake,axes[by the way the snake and axes don't cancel each other when the snake's head is in],vine,boulders)It has lots of nice pieces.If you actually know the storyline you would know that everything fits together.The only thing bad about this set is that all the knights should be there.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-10T12:36:07Z","Decent...","I was curious at what kind of set this was going to be like to 
build.  I was NOT impressed with the Jack Stone Building elements nor the &quot;water&quot; plates used.  

I was disappointed about Rascus not getting a European Armor
breast plate.

However, I liked the design of the tower, really enjoyed
the design of the &quot;vines&quot;, and thought the &quot;serpent&quot; was
a nice touch.  The Guardian of Orlan is also a rarity,
making the set a must have.

"iephant","2007-03-14T21:18:56.28Z","Ok...","This set is ok...I was slightly annoyed when i recieved not one but 2 for Christmas...The snake head is pretty bad and the vine thing doesn't work...I like the boulder bridge and the tower is really cool!

pros:
The boulder lifting mechanism is nice
The tower is really cool!
It comes with a ton of jewels!
The guardian minifig rocks!
Frog

cons: 
Snake Head
The Vines...
Rascus + Santis = bad color choice

Overall a good set but i would have preferred a basilisk like snake.Plus i got TWO...Groan...

"Blade","2007-07-22T04:07:45.467Z","Citadel = Pain","After reading everyone else's reviews, I felt it was time to put my own in as many valid points have been made, but some overlooked.

Is this a castle? No. Simply No. Its called a citadel similar yet different. Personally more like a tower the 2 booby traps on either side. They aren't trying to take the building, just simply reach the wizard to get the prize.

A point was made about the bridge and the boulders. Yes they are on the wrong side but im assuming they have done this for the kids. if it was the other way around it would be too tricky, not saying it couldn't be done, but for convenience.

As for the swingy trap its not the easiest thing in the world to work but its not overly hard either. try doing it slowly and start the next one before he drops from the current one. the last one needs to be fast and he will flip up.

The spinning axe and snake head well that is just a huge F*** Up! You cant use both at once. But i put to you this, Will you need to use them both at the same time? The snake if someone walked past and the axes are for the slid. The slide doesn't meet up with the snake, so really no need to use both things at once. But still poorly designed and just plain annoying. 

Overall im not quite sure how to rate this one, like the colour scheme, lots of characters, cool traps n gizmo's but the flaws??? I'm going to go with a 7/10 on this one.

Id really recommend having a look or a play with one before buying and considering its place in your collection or play.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"thenaterater","2008-07-12T20:55:28.89Z","cool set","this set is cool! it has many features; the vines, the axes, the snake, the drawbridge, the treasure chest guarded by an axe, and much more, i think that they put the drawbridge the wrong way so that the knights would have to come up the stairs, and have the power to knock the boulders of off the platform, thus raising the bridge. the thing i dislike about this set is the color of the knights, red and green, come on lego.  i think the wizard, and the shadow knight are both way cool though",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-07-17T17:19:37.99Z","Citadel of Orlan, Knight's Kingdoms II most unrealistic set.","<p><strong>Overall 3 bricks</strong> : My first complaint is the name: &nbsp;<em>A Citadel is </em><span a=""undefined"" closure_uid_1dis2o=""89"" f=""4"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en"" sc=""null""><em><span class=""hps"" closure_uid_1dis2o=""136"" sc=""null"">an often</span> <span class=""hps"" closure_uid_1dis2o=""137"" sc=""null""><strong>star-shaped</strong></span> <span class=""hps"" closure_uid_1dis2o=""138"" sc=""null"">fortress that</span> <span class=""hps"" closure_uid_1dis2o=""139"" sc=""null"">dominates</span> </em><span class=""hps"" closure_uid_1dis2o=""140"" sc=""null""><em>a fortified city</em>.

It could just as easy (or better)&nbsp;have been an Adventurers set. Finished building it looks nice from a distance and it has some usefull parts and one good new minifigure : <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/cas264"">The Guardian</a>. Used not an expensive set but not an easy set to find, simply because I think it wasn&#39;t a bestseller. If you are a Castle collector it deserves its place, for young kids its fun to play with. Because of this I give a small 3 bricks.</span></span></p>
