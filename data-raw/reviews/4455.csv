"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-31T19:08:06Z","A good starting point, i guess","Here I am reviewing another of my nephew's castles. Unlike my review of the citadel of whatever, i will point out the good things as well

The good:

-I actually like the interchangible towers

-good selection of pieces

-kills two birds with one stone, is also a villain castle

-nice gate mechanism.

The bad:

-all kinds of gaps and holes in the wall. invaders could just crawl inside the castle behind.

-would have been nice to have extra &quot;modules&quot; for the interchangable tower system.

-catapult has too low a firing arc, cant go over the walls.

-An archer could easily kill the king standing in his wide open throne room in the tower.

-The set seemed to have been designed so that you can transform the castle without removing any pieces, except you still have to remove the top flag, they could have just put a hinged brick.


The ugly:

-Theres nothing on the back side!! its only half a castle!!!


All in all, its a decent set, i dont know if its worth the 80something dollars, as it looks almost like an unfinished design.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-12T10:47:10Z","It's pre-lauched already","Personally, I like the new colour scheme - the new light gray and dark gray seem to be &quot;shinny&quot; and the blue colour is beautiful.

The new horse head and house barding are very cool (brilliant blue colour). 

This set still applies the &quot;modular concept&quot; where all the small towers are movable/detachable easily unlike the 6098.

The most outstanding feature of this set is that this blue-colour-themed castle can be changed into red-colour-themed in a split second. However, there are still some blue pieces that cannot be hidden from view.

This set still has some weakness like the 6098 set. The back view is not that great. I really like the main front gate but there is a too-spaciou-valley after the front gate before you get to the main tower of the castle.

I like the light blue knight (Jayko) but other colours are not realistic for knights.

Possibly the worst castle set ever (yes, it's definitely worse than that of Leo's). I would say Leo's castle look &quot;Disneyland-like&quot; and grand from the front at least if i have to, but castle Morcia looks like... Crap! It's way too juniorized and to an extent doesn't even look lego. 

Pros: The villains, 
portcullis

Cons: Over-juniorized (just look at... everything!), Castle's empty and insubstantial (you'll realise if you see the real thing), 
bad design (eg. the flags are sticking out from all the wierd places in an unfashionable way), 
the rest of the minifigs (duh!).

LEGO are trying too hard to make a good impression upon their new castle creations and I reckon they're getting worse...to the point of sending us in to insanity. Being 19, and still playing with LEGO System, I must say that I'd rather play with some of the older sets from 2000-2001, or just settle building my own castles rather than look at this desaster! LEGO, how old are you? Come on, dazzle us, delighten us, and stop designing absolute and utter garbage!! Grow up to yourselves! I reckon the characters in this castle look like ripp-offs to the japanese toys their selling at the moment... But oh well, that's their loss, not mine! I'm gonna buy the Citadel to this set when I get the money (very shortly, mind you) and not waste any more money on LEGO until I have at least read a dozen reviews on these things. Now, just for the record of castles, I was saying that I'd rather build my own, and that's because mine at LEAST look convincing enough to sell and be a successful product. My castle is formidable, compared to this heap of wanna-be trash - although I admit that the pieces are good ^_^!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-28T08:36:16Z","The Castle of Morcia!","Before I start the review, I would like to say some things. Number 1, this is a child's toy, so please don't go there with the juniorizedness. Number 2, it has no back so that you can actually play inside it. Number 3, there was only one Stormtrooper in the Cloudcity Set, but no one complained about that. Ok, now on with the review.

The Minifigs
The minifigs are pretty good, with nice armor and helmets. The &quot;strange colors&quot; are there because this is FANTASY, NOT MIDEVIL TIMES. I like that rare crown piece. The Shadow Knight helmet is also nice... it looks like a Greek War Helmet.

The Scorpion Catapult
The catapult was nice, it actually looked like a scorpion. It had a poor firing range though.

The Gate
Nice Construction, nice locking mechanism. Very good.

The Boulder Catapult

And please don't brag Greg McKenzie because nobody thinks you're castle is good-looking either. To Nuggets_092, NOBODY WILL BELIEVE YOU when you never even said WHY you hate it. All you just said, o i'm not going to buy any of this stuff because its not good. BE MORE SPECIFIC! Man, I don't get these people. They should learn some grammar before they write ANY reviews. Doesn't a grammar book tell you that when you're writing your opinion that you have to tell WHY? Sorry galidor, but I don't know what you're talking about. And to Henry Lynn, you have so MUCH good comments about the castle and yet you give it a four? The only bad comment that you gave about the castle was about it's uglyness at the back. If it had the back all covered up, then how can you fit things inside? Geez, these people are so dumb! They have no brains!!! And to vshy you are one weird guy. What do you mean it's not a castle? What's the title of it? Its called Lego Knight's Kingdom: Castle of Morcia for crying out loud. And so what if there's not enough soldiers? GO BUY MORE! I have this castle and I'm a pro at Lego and if you're saying that I'm lieing right now then howcome I'm writing this WHOLE paragraph? 


MY OPINION:

I think that you have to tell why you like it and why you hate it...

This castle is pretty big for a Lego Castle, I like all the different kinds of pieces. I really like how you can change the the castle into evil and into good. The Minifigures are really impressive too! You can pull their little helmets up and they even have their own little fighting sword and shield. Vladek's chamber is such a amazing secret! I like it so much and whenever I play with the castle on my own, I always hide things in the secret chamber. I love the boulder catapult, it really goes flying! I use it the hit my little brother! When me and my brother are playing war with eachother with our own lego sets, I always use the boulder catapult to knock down his men. 

I would definetely recommend this set to people 5 years and older. I give Lego a well done for this wonderful spectacular set! WELL DONE!! Please buy this set if you are into the medevil times and a lego fan. Don't listen to the people who dislike this set because they don't have anything so say why they dislike it.

 the castle is great for extra bricks and stuff. and the baseplate is not to bad. it is really really really open so ya can play with it quite well...
therefor I guess it is nice for the really young people

(who did not have had the pleasure of laying siege to the (6074) Falcons castle. or the black Lords castle. (6085))

but for me it is terrible, it is to open, someone said that that was so people could easy play with it.. but if ya compare it to 6085 this is bullsh*t. this castle only looks alright at best from the front. 6085 looks cool from all sides and ya can open up that castle to have easy acces to the jail and stuff..


further I find there are to litle bricks. and the minifigues...oh don't get me started on those.... the bad guys are not to bad I think :P I especially like the helmet of the evil soldier (not the heavy knight) but I wonder what was wrong about the old designs, who after all where much nicer then those green, purple and red imitation knights.... I got an standing Knights army of over 110 minifigures (quite awsome to lay a siege to a friends castle :P) but I will never ever use these imitation knights. (unless I can find a way to paint them so thy have normal colors)

I think that Lego worked very hard on this set I love this castle, I can really tell that it's much much better than it's old castle, the Black Monarch's Castle. I'm very into the Medievil times and this is just perfect! So if you're a big medievil fan and a lego fan, then get the Castle of Morcia. I can tell you a few things about this castle...


- It has 632 pieces...

- It's about $130.00, so save up!

- It has ALOT of tunnels and secret passage ways

- Comes with King Mathias, Jayko, Santis, Danju, Rascus, a Skeletoon, Shadow Knight (only 1), Vladek and much more...

- Also comes with a scorpion catapult

- The castle is switchable (which means you can change it to good or evil)

- It has a Vladek's Secret Chamber which is a small chamber that you can hide things in it

- You can purchase castle accessories and add it on to youre castle

You may not like the Castle of Morcia, but believe me, just this once, buy the whole collection. The Grand Tournament, The Border Ambush, Vladek's Siege Engine, Knight's Castle Wall, Vladek Encounter, Castle of Morcia and The Citadel of Orlan. Once you have all those, you'll love the Knight's Kingdom collection as much as I love it. I also like Black Monarch's Castle, it's also pretty good but it isnt really as good as Castle of Morcia.

It's pretty hard for me myself. It took me about 1-3 hours. I'm giving it a 10 because it was so stunning. I like the way how it is built. The only problem with this set is that it doesn't come with enough men. But that isn't that bad, I mean like, who cares?!? This set has 632 pieces. You should sort out all the pieces before building the castle because you don't want to look through a huge pile just to find one single little piece. The base is ok...it could do better. Vladek's Secret Chamber is an awesome accessorie! Just like Tyler Hamilton said, you can purchase extra castle accessories if you want. The castle of morcia can also change into evil and good. That means you can change the blue flags into red to make it look evil and change them back to blue to make it look good.


The Castle of Morcia is quite big, so don't get worried if you think it's small. It's about as big as your computer screen. At the other side of the castle, there's nothing there. It's an empty spot. That way, you can fit your minifigures into the back of the castle. 


The Knight's Castle Wall set is a great set to go along with the Castle of Morcia. So if you purchase the castle of morcia, makesure you also purchase the Knight's Castle Wall.

Weapons/Armor: 10/10. I think the sheilds look great and I like how you can take a spear or axe and put it in the holder of the sheild... and I like the different shapes of the helmets. The catapult on the castle works well.

Figures: 10/10. As long as the set comes with minifigures I'm happy, and I like the skeleton and the completely red, green, blue, purple, and black suits. The skeleton and the skeleton head are great too. 

Animals: 3/10. The animals may not seem important to anyone else but I'm a fan of animals in real life and am really happy when I get a new LEGO animal, I like the scorpion catapult and I use it a real giant scropion, but that and a spiders and a couple of tiny scropions isn't good enough for me.

Structure: 9/10/. The structure of this set is fantastic and I hope LEGO keeps improving there sets. I have the 1st Knight's Kingdom castle and I like the draw bridge that came with it and mad that they got rid of it in this one and there is no way of getting up into the main room but I'm not going to complain. The 
prison is very well with the mad skeleton head inside it and the small space to make the captive go insane. The tall tower is great for playing, you could have someone scout the surroundings on the top of it and tell if someone was attacking them or not.

Playability: 10/10. I have many sets and when I get one I combind it with others when I play with it so really its playability is combind with other set's playability. My thought about its playability really doesn't matter, because it depends on the person's imganition if they think it has a good playability or not.

Overall: 10/10. Any LEGO set would get a 10 from me really.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

this set is overall not worth buying, but worth keeping together if you have it, and im glad i wrote this review  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Lint","2010-02-20T20:20:59.95Z","Not a great castle but a comprehensive playset","<p>Althought not without it's faults this set maximises on play value. Knights Kingdom II was aimed at a younger audience and you have to acknowledge the fact to appreciate it. This set offers the whole KK ensemble cast: Jayko, Santis, Rascus, Danju, King Mathias, Vladek and his nameless minion! The big gimmick with this set is that it can be converted to an evil castle at the flick of (many) switches. It can also be rebuilt into another two castles and a battle playset as shown by the box.</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<ul>
    <li>Excellent play value. If I was a child again I would have been ecstatic with this set. The modular design allows you to rearrange the seven core modules of the castle (the four turret towers, the portcullis gate, the two centre chambers and the centre spire). The castle can also be rebuilt into two different castles and a battleground featuring a castle wall and a catapult. Two of the turret towers double as a jail/dungeon and a meditation/shrine room: with a revolving skeleton wall!</li>
    <li>You get the whole core ensemble of KK minifigs. This is like a childs dream. Instead of buying up four or five sets to collect all the rainbow knights you can have them all in one fell swoop!</li>
    <li>Glorious amount of weapons and other minifig accessories. Even if over half of them are castle decorations.</li>
    <li>Glorious amount of scorpions, if you're into that sort of thing</li>
    <li>Portcullis I found novel in design. Transformation is cute.</li>
    <li>Lots and lots of treasure</li>
    <li>Nice castle baseplate and overall great source of block and plate parts</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS</p>
<ul>
    <li>The castle itself is very simplistic and due to the number of large pieces, is about as interesting to build as a cardboard box. Ideal for kids.</li>
    <li>The gimmicks are hopeless. The scorpion catapult seems incapable of ballistic shots (fires straight more than anything). The castle catapult does a little better of a job but it's weak construction means it snaps off just about every time you shoot.</li>
    <li>King Mathias got no shield</li>
    <li>The transformation gimmick leaves more to be desired. Theres still a lot of blue showing on the flags and the turret towers themselves. The flags could have been easily rectified.</li>
    <li>Not a great deal of pieces overall. I bought this second hand but value for money at full retail would be garbage. However it still beats buying smaller sets just to collect the cast of minifigs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while the castle itself is not impressive the play value of this set is ultimate. You get the full set of good and evil knights kingdom characters, lots of gimmicks and the set can be rebuilt into other castles/scenery (a feature sadly lost in many modern lego sets). Only buy if you or your kids want to play.</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,3
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-26T18:31:34.03Z","HOURS of Fun!!","Fling the boulder onto the scorpion catapult!  Sling scorpions into the castle!  Change the castle from good to bad!  Put the king in jail!  Save him!  I'm telling you, the things you can do with this thing are endless.  My brother got this one Christmas, but he didn't really want it, and I have another Lego he wanted, so I traded.  It's in my closet at the moment, because it almost lost its life as a built set when it was in storage a while ago.  Anyway, a good set for any builder.  The skeleton is handy, and the treasure chest is also neat, even though it only has three coins on the inside.  Also, what about good soldiers?

Pros:

-All the major characters of KK

-Skeleton

-Castle easily turns from good to bad

-Boulder catapult works well

-Castle can come apart into separate parts

-Scorpion catapult

-Castle entrance

Cons:

-No good soldiers

Compared to King Leo's Castle or the Royal Knight's Castle, this set is garbage - the Knights and the swords are retarded.

"nicker94","2009-01-26T10:40:10.14Z","Possibly worst lego castle set ever?!","Do the the lego castle designers even consider historical reference anymore as a rough guideline for the design of this set and more recent lego castle sets? This set has lots of play features and color but thats what actually brings it down. it looks more like a cheap toy with lots of play gimmicks and not so much like a lego set. Whats up with the bright colored figures and weird looking swords. Knights Kingdom theme is definitely a low point in Lego castle set history. There is no gate house for the portcullis which in my opinion is one of the major design flaws. This set is just plain weird and looks like a castle crossed with power rangers theme more than anything. I really hope that things turn around at lego and they get back to their roots with better set designs that actually make sense and are roughly based on real world castle designs. Some of the newest sets being released show some promise but there is still work to be done to get lego castle back to what it should be. In my opinion that set is very forgettable.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"Ernst","2012-02-07T15:23:15.4Z","Looks great, looks like a Castle, but in fact not a ""real"" Castle.","<p>Overall&nbsp;3 bricks: it all depends how you look at it and who but this is in all aspects a two-faced Castle. When built it looks great, face 1 is the Blue Castle and face 2 the Red Castle. But looking at it as a Castle collector I start wondering about the design. No real walls but just 4 corner towers, the huge main tower and the loose entrance gate with a fence. No stairs to enter the towers, backside is open so why the fence&nbsp;? Simply because it has high playability for younger owners and the possibility to change it into a Shadow Knight Castle I give&nbsp;3 bricks. But looking at the architecture&nbsp;it is not a real Castle to be honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks: Building is not too hard because of all the big parts and the lack of walls.</p>
<ul>
<li>First you assemble the minifigures and the Scorpion Catapult. The catapult is precisionwork with a lot of small technic parts. Not too hard but needs focus. 
<li>Rear right tower: not much building, one big front wall and the turret on top and a&nbsp;turneable&nbsp;shield on the backside. In the room a small weapons chamber with 2 swords.&nbsp;No side walls&nbsp;and a turneable rear wall with torches and a skeleton. 
<li>Rear left tower: also a big one piece frontwall and 2&nbsp;ladders on the back and two pillars as side walls, the prison. Again a&nbsp;turret and 2 grey bars on top with again the turneable shield. 
<li>Front left tower: a low tower built out of smaller bricks (several slope parts) with a big&nbsp;catapult, top again with a turret. The small room is empty. 
<li>Front right tower: same as the left tower but without the catapult, small room hides a big spider. 
<li>The Central tower has three floors, the first being the treasure room with the treaure chest in the middle with front side the turneable blue/red pillars. No hidden traps to protect it, no walls on the side and rear side. The second floor is the Kings chamber with again the blue/red turneable pillars, side walls are 2 wallparts which you can open, backside open again. The top floor tower is made of a wall part and a turret in front and on top with the flag on it. 
<li>The front entrance: a loose plate not connected to the Castle with only a gate without doors with a blue and a red side. No real mechanism to open it, just small brick with handle to lock it.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 3 bricks: a lot of nice parts but nothing spectacular. The set offers sufficient minifigures being the King with horse and his 4 Knights and 2 Shadow Knights although one more Shadow Knight would have been welcome. To be honest I don't really like the ""good"" Knights with their funny colours. Overall sufficient weapons for the Knights and also in the Castle. The flags look good as well as the turneable banners and the blue and red pillars. Nice accesoires being for instance&nbsp;the scorpions, spider and the&nbsp;treasurebox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty 5 bricks: to play with this is a great set. The 8 minifigures, attack and defence catapult and the possibility the change the colour of the Castle will&nbsp;give a younger owner hours of fun. No argument here, 5 well deserved bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks: Average value is €60,00 which I think is reasonable for this set depending why you want it. If you look for a ""real"" Castle, don't buy it but if you simply want to collect Castle sets or look for a playing Castle it is worth it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,5,3
