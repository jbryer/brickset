The shields are flimsy and easily fall off, we kept the cards inside the container as not to damage or lose them. Young kids enjoy this size toy - and yes it was LEGO so we had to get the entire set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:16:51.17Z","Galidor - Black","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  Vladek is the black one and the sole enemy of the 4 knights and their king.  (Someone needs to refine the storyline!)  His action figure includes a rather intresting match of black bricks with red highlights which is what Lego seems to be pushing as all things evil.  However the swept back look of the helmet and the pointy shield gives it a bit of character when compared to its &quot;brother&quot; knights.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Pros: well scorpian is a good idea and the sword and mask look amazing, perfect for this set.

Cons: looks too spinny and flimsy, esspeically the legs
