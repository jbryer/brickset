"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T08:05:11Z","Awsome!!!!!","I got this set and IT IS DA BOMB!!!!!!!!! He has indago armor and the design on it is AWSOME!!! He comes with cool crown and lots of other goodies, like a cloth king's cape, 2 sets of knights stickers and a map! The only reason that I rated this sweet set a 9 is because of 3 main factors:
1. He has the same sword as Jayko's, color and all.
2. His shield shape is the same as Jayko's shield.
3. He comes with no cards.
But if you get by the above 3 reasons, you'll adore this set like me!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-15T21:06:07Z","Pretty Good","I just got this today, it's pretty good, but sadly no cards, I don't even play the card game, but they have interesting infor about storyline and characters which I like, sadly the sword isn't new, but I can deal, Moc-ers should definately get this set for the fabric cape.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-28T04:24:48Z","Very good!","This set is very good. The cape is a nice touch, and the crown looks pretty neat. The blue is also a bit refreshing, compared to Gali's blue. The only drawback for King Mathias is that his sworsd and shield are the same design as Jayko's.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-30T07:57:25Z","King Mathias the Good","Awesome set. The sword and shield might be the same as Jaykos, but it has two things the others don't that totally make up for it... a cape and a Crown. Now my entire Knights Kingdom Megafigure collection is complete!
So...
That blue color is great, it looks very regal. And the sword and Crown are gold... like the Avohkii!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-20T21:57:57Z","King Mathias of Morcia","Good pricing for a figure, a bonus cape, crown, two sheets of stickers, and a poster. He looks very nice in my megafig castle(used instructions in Knights Workshop on the KK website). His royal blue garb makes him look... royal.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:19:27.56Z","Galidor - King","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  King Mathias is a late addition and probably one of the best of the lot.  His action figure includes cloak and a crown, something that is missing from the other 5.  The gold-printed blue bricks also attempts to tie in to the rest of the non-Action Figure theme.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily, even with the cape acting as a &quot;stand&quot;.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.  However, this set is visually appealing enough to overcome a little of those disadvantages.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-12T13:18:23.95Z","i like this guy","i know its not realy fair because a rated the rest of them 2 and this guys like exactly the same, but i just realy like this one. hes not that detailed, his hcrown is kinda plain and the only printed brick on his body is his torso which has a gear on the back to make his arm move up and down which looks dumb because his arm stays totaly strait. the sword is ok, but has no use other than for him, and his sheild is terrable. when you look at in a picture it looks like a solid thing, but actualy its a peice of cardboard stuck down by one stud as you can imagine, it doesnt stay on to well. the cape is realy cool, but the sword and sheild are the sdame as jaykos just difrent color. this set is not worth it and has no point of buying it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-14T14:22:51.937Z","King of Morcia","This is the first version of the first action figure of a king, the king mathias. Have features like the gold color, don't shine very, but with the dark blue is great. The crown is included, don't looks like a real one, but can be putted easily and shows the yellow lego face. The shield have a lion's head design, included previously in great sets of older knights kingdom. He have too a gear system on back, the body is only one piece, and can be used with another lego pieces. The sword is the same of the jayko knight, and have a cover too, not a great thing, but childrens will like this and the complete set, because is very easy to build, play and mix with other lego pieces to make creations. He likes the other knights, action figures that are lego at the same time, very playable, useful and compatible with the other sets, like the legs and arms, later used on exo-force or the armors, too used on racers. This is incomparable to galidor, have their own and the lego's characteristics. Is very easy to play, build or make creations with it, although is an action figure on lego style. I rate 5/5 this set.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-14T10:08:19.05Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - King Mathias Review","This is a cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The legs, the feet, the arms and the head can be moved. One hand has a shield and the other one has a sword. On the back of the torso you can find a lever which can move the arm with the sword up and down. The figure also comes with a nice crown and a cloth cape. The only problem with this set is that the shield comes off very easily if you touch it. As I told you in the beginning:  It's a cool figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The sword has a very contemporary and classic feel to it.<br></li><li>-The decorations on the torso piece are also nice, showing that he is the king.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The flimsy shield seen throughout the first year of Knights' Kingdom is here in all of its horrifying terror.<br></li><li>-The use of the light blue joints is also ineffectively used here, looking weird on the whole model. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a very cool model, something to stand up to compared to the rest of the Knights' Kingdom sets. I recommend this to all Castle fans who love action figures.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
