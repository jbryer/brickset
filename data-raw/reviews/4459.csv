"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-05T18:24:31Z","Another Great Set","I got Knight's Castle Wall when I bought Vlakek's Siege Engine at Toysrus. Jakyo, Rascus and Santis are cool minifigures. Their swords and shields are cool. I like the colors of the flags and purple-blue blocks. Castle Tolonjay is very cool. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-01T13:55:58Z","Nice fort, Strange colours","Yes, they sell them in shop for 75% with 8800. I was very interrested in the rainbow knights and this was the most castle set of this year. There are 2 big juniorized bricks in it and they are a bit too big, but the rest of the bricks are okay. The colours are differrent, not only the new light and dark grey but also the blue. It is a purple blue and its a nice colour if Tlc not made the last 2 years already 3 new blues (grey blue monsterstudios,Light blue designer sets and dark blue orient exped.). The figs are good, more than I thought, only the helmets are shutting themselves the whole time. I like the face of the green knight ( Rascus?) most, The face of the red knight is also good for a pirate. The blue knight is ( I thought) the owner of the fort, His shield and colours are marked on the walls. That means this is Castle Tolonjay (from Jayko). The doors are great, this is the first time I have such doors in a set.
There is only nothing at the back of the wall.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T15:33:55Z","perfect other than the fact that its kk2","I got this set the same time as 8800 (I bought k8800) this set lacks quite a bit of playability unless you buy both, unlike the seige engine.(Thats why if you've read my review on that set I rated it higher) once again heres a list of pros and cons.


PROS
*good set design, wall kinda like the one from the 80s.
*extra jayko shield (I like those).
*rascus has armor.
*little gold thing(no clue what its for, just looks good.)

CONS
*not much playability.
*side parts on it usually fall off.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-03T17:58:00Z","helm's deep","This entire theme reminds me of LOTR, so at the top of any 
reviews I do of these sets I will say what scene it reminds me of. This set is very good, it has alot of playability in it, if you have baddies to attack it. The gates are cool. The knights are cool. It dosen't have the king because he's busy running the place, probably also preparing his castle for a siege. The purple knight isn't hard to get, just buy Vladek Encounter, you'll get a horse for Vladek with it. TLC didn't make larger in order to keep the price down $20, $15 if you buy the TRU two-pack, like me. In all, a great set. Go buy it now, you won't regret it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SaintElsewhere","2008-12-28T13:49:44.373Z","Brilliant","I got this as part of the value pack and loved it to death. The build was simple but enjoyable and the design was rather well thought-out. The figs are neat and I never minded the colour scheme for the armour. The weapons are rather neat and the castle itself is very colourful. There are a lot of useful pieces for MOCs and I like the cauldron thing that can tip over and dump red-hot bricks on the enemies' heads.

"Ernst","2012-06-06T17:59:40.373Z","Good Castle Wall, strange Knights","<p>Overall 4 bricks : A nice set with some points of critic but overall it's a good Castle set. The weak points are the bright colored Knights (personal opinion), too much big parts and no Shadow Knights present. Still a fine Castle set with several building possibilities which makes it just a small 4 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : I made&nbsp;two buildings of this set, the Wall and the Tower you find on the back of the box. Both nice results but too much big wall parts, tower parts and turrets to call the build exciting like in all KK II sets. The hinges used in the Wall give the possibility to bent the Wall some. Overall no great building experience. The Wall looks good when finished with a good entrance and a catapult on the centre wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : A lot of usefull parts in this set like the doors, inverted blue slopes and several usefull parts for Castle MOC's. Alltough I dislike the bright Knights, their shields are nice and usefull. Missing are&nbsp;at least&nbsp;two Shadow Knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : A nice looking defence Wall with 3 Knights but no enemy's to defend it from so no real playing value. If you add some Shadow Knights sets it's a fine set to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=8799-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average of some €21,00 fo a used set, a bit too much in my opinion. Since it is not a real exciting set and&nbsp;I don't expect this set will be a future collecters item I think €15,00 is a good price for this set at this time.</p>
