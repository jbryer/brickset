"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-01T14:03:44Z","Good siege weapon","I bought it with a 2 pack of 8799. The thing to open the door is nice done, it has the head of the golden Dragon of Orient Expedition. It has 2 black chains in it. The flag has on the other side a lionhead from the king. The minifigs are good. Vladek is a nice villian and much more realistic than Ogel but they look both angry. The shadow knight has a nice helmet and the head is also ok. It would be nice when there were 2 shadowknights.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-09T14:59:58Z","mucho gracias!","this set is really good! a lot of people think that knights kingdom is just babyish brightly coloured juniorised rubbish,(although i dislike the bionicle-like action figure versions) but i think that the minifigs are amazing, especially vladek and the shadow knights. Many castle fans have always wanted official lego siege engines, and i think that this is better than i expected. In this set is also a good supply of axes, etc. i think that vladek's breastplate is amazing and i also love the shadow knights helmets especially.
lovely siege tower.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-10T12:13:18Z","Solid set.","I want to start off by saying that im not a fan of the new Knights Kingdom. The mini figs annoy me and dont even get me started on the swords! Having said that I beleive this set here is a dimond among a bunch of crap. This Siege Engine was very well thought out and would go great with any castle collection. Now if they'd just get rid if the new swords!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-11T23:39:17Z","Amazing! Buy it while you can!","I too got this as part of the 8800+8799 double pack. It is a VERY enjoyable model. This is one of the best sets in the whole line (though maybe the second wave of sets will surpass it).

Minifigs
Vladek: He looks like Sauron! AWESOME armour. The helmet's not so hot but still kinda cool for a bigger selection in your collection. His face is odd, but anything Ogel-based will be.
Shadow Knight: what can I say? One of the best helmets ever made. The helmet is obviously LOTR-inspired, and would look right at home on orcs in a LEGO-licensed LOTR line. The torso is also a keeper. And he's got a nice evil face in comparison to his &quot;master&quot;.

Accessories
This set has a whole heap of halberds and pikes (those Adventurers ones). It also has a red Saturday Morning sword (which isn't *too* bad in this colour) and the shield is quite neat, whether or not you like the design (I do). Wish it was printed on black though. In pictures they appear to be white but they're actually Very Light Grey.

Playability:
This set is best used in connection with 8799, but you can easily make your own little wall thing to attack. The battering ram actually works--well, of course LEGO binds so well you can't possibly dismantle the castle with it, but the swinging motion is quite pleasing. The little drawbridge is also neat but there should be a way to lock it (it will stay up if left alone BUT even the most gentle forward-backward motion sends it crashing down). However you can &quot;cheat&quot; to lock it by loosening the flag holding thing, leaning it to one side.

...and the bad?
The downside of the ram design is that the mechanism takes up so much room that there is no room for an interior where men can wait before surging over the drawbridge.

The battering ram wobbles from side to side when used, and this could have easily been fixed by including double the current amount of Technic plate-beam things. Or using the stud-width ones instead. Nothing major though.

The cardboard shields are really rather awful from a purist's perspective, but they DO hide the internal workings very well and &quot;brand&quot; the model's faction better than hanging flags would. From a child's point of view, I'm sure spares of these would come in handy for the big figures (in case your original shield gets bent/torn/etc.)

The flag has TWO designs on it. One of the scorpion and the other of the lion-with-crown. If you want it hanging against a wall it's fine but to have it anywhere where you could see both sides would be strange. But being able to decide which design you want is overall quite useful.

I had originally intended to buy this 2-pack just for parts, but as with the recent Orient Expedition sets I've bought for parts (7146, 7147, 7149) the visual appeal of the out-of-box model when assembled will surprise you.

Children and adults alike will love it. On its own, this set is excellent. Packed in with 8799 with a discount on top of that, it's FANTASTIC!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T20:40:44Z","back to the 80s","this is probably going to be the best set in the kk2 line. Now I dont want to get into a huge list of pros and cons but ill give you a little one.

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-19T23:54:56.467Z","&quot;Tonight, we dine in Hell!!&quot;","This set is great as an addition to ANY fan's collection. I got it as part of the combo pack so I know what I'm talking about. It comes with two minifigs: Vladek and a Shadow Knight. These two work as villians wherever you want to put 'em. The siege tower is a cool design but not as good as the one in the '08 Tower Raid set.
Also, last time I checked, the dragon head is rare.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-01-15T15:08:41.52Z","Good Siege tower with great parts !","<p>Overall 5 bricks: I consider this one of the best sets in the Knights' Kingdom II theme and one of the best Siege Towers in the Castle series. Although there is no wall or tower to attack or opposite Knights in this set I evaluate the tower and I think it is the second best of all. The tower in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=40475"">6061-1</a> (Siege Tower), which still is my favorite, stood model for this&nbsp;tower in my opinion. There&nbsp;is only&nbsp;a bit of a flaw in this one, being the first floor. Normally the floor where the knights are before they run over the plank to enter the enemy castle, now it is used for the mechanism of the ram. The Knights have to be on the plank already or jump from the top floor, a bit strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks: it is fun to built this tower, not much difficulties with a great stable and good working result. You start with the wheelbase on which you mount a goodlooking and well working battering ram.&nbsp;The mechanism is placed on what you can call the first floor and works fine. No big wall parts in this tower but just small parts but a very solid result. Where in 6061 a string with wheel was used to lower the board here 2 chains are used without&nbsp;a wheel to lower it, on top the Vladek banner to keep it up. On the sides you place the big shields with square holes in it&nbsp;with Vladek's sign on it, 2 small round plates to mount it and works very well that way. Top floor with small walls and 4 spears and red&nbsp;banners. With the torches and the red slopes on the top and the board it has the real Vladek look. Final result is a stable, well working and good riding siege tower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks: although no enemy building or Knights great parts are used for this tower. Two very good looking and well armed minifigures. The shields on the sides are great and 4 extra spears for the Knights to use. One banner and 2 red flags for identification and a bonus for the golden head on the ram, a great part !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks: you don't have any fun with this set on its own, you can only play with it combined with other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks: last known RRM is in euro's about the same as the average price on Bricklink now being â‚¬ 16,65 which is in my opinion a reasonable price for a nice set like this.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4
