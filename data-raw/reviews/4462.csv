Although it has just one &quot;technical system&quot;, the steering, it's amazingly detailed for it's time. I think the Formula 1-car is nicer than the second car, but they both have the steering column. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The car looks great and I always had fun playing with the rack n pinion steering.  After building this set I put it on display for a number of years.  The steering wheel itself was one of the better pieces in this set because of its realistic look.  The number 28 on the front is printed on but on the sides of the wing it is placed on with stickers.  The two stickers are the main drawback of this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
