"Aqualize","2010-01-07T05:49:55.577Z","Not so much technic","The disappointing with this set is that it doesn't utilize the technic parts in any funny function way.
It brings to much thinking of the Lego System branch with it, e.g. the lights and a special part for the steering. It's kind of a hybrid and will not make a young child that likes lego system want more technic because it is ""the same"" but in a bigger scale and a bit uglier.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"clundsberg","2011-04-29T22:51:29.68Z","First Tech Set from Germany.","<p>I received this as a gift from my cousin in Germany as we were both heavily into motorcycles.&nbsp; I have always been more of the minifigure sets, but this was my first introduction to a more complex world of Legos.</p>
<p>Smaller parts for a more intricate build, this set was always more for display than play for me.&nbsp; The stearing works, it has a moving kickstand to keep it from rolling off the shelf and the neatest aspect to me: the working rear shocks.</p>
<p>You can build a tri-wheeled model from this set as well and if you cared to buy a power pack unit, you could even have it roll on its own. (though from what I saw in the instructions it looked quite restricted by&nbsp;the power cord and I'm not sure how fast it could go)</p>
<p>I've since received another Technic model of a mini-bike (Shell exclusive) which uses a rubber band for the shock effect. It sits by this bike, also more for display than play.</p>
<p>Overall - it wasn't a bad introduction to technic and a good set to have if you are a bike enthusiast.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4

It's very personal, of course. My dad (R.I.P.) brought this little set as gift, when I was lying in hospital during summer vacation 1991. So, this bike will always gather the pole-position.<br><br>But besides all personal memories, 8810 offers nice parts and features:<br><br>First of all, it introduced part 2904 ""Technic Motorcycle Pivot"", in addition to set 8838. It seems as if TLC wanted to introduce new parts in both small and bigger sets.<br>Using this part, made it possible to construct a steering that both works and looks realistic.<br><br>Second, this set contains white technic bricks. Not that much, but quite remarkable at that time.<br><br>Third, it offers a working rear suspension and a hinged kickstand. So, you can cruise around, perform some stunts (you know, the working suspension...), and finally park it in a proper way.<br><br>Well done TLC.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
