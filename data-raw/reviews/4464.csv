Pros:
Toa Lhikan like other Toa Metru
Good Posebility
Secure Body of Kikanalo 
Brand New for Toa Lhikan
Lots of Good Pieces

Cons:
Toa Lhikan Not as Shiny as Pictured
Weapons Way to Big for Body and Hard to Pose

All in all : 9/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greg_duncan","2007-10-08T19:32:08.78Z","An Classic!","I remember wanting this set so much when pictures of it first came out. This shiny gold toa, riding atop a giant steed with giant swords was just the coolest idea for a Bionicle toa to me at the time and I have never regretted getting this set. Even a couple years later, this set beats the pants off some of the Bionicle sets these days. Great parts of this set include but are not limited to the great stability, parts, construction, and price, but unfortunately, there are a few minor gripes I had about this set. The promotional image shown here and everywhere else shows Lhikan with shiny gold armour, when in fact, the colour is quite a bit duller. Also, the swords are a little bit awkward- they don't seem to fit his hands well at all. Other than that, this is a fantastic set well worth buying for mocers and collectors alike.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-27T14:08:43.86Z","The legendary toa lhikan as a set","This is the set form of toa lhikan with a set form of kikanalo, they are the originals, with the great weapons, and the awesome colors. The kikanalo have some black,silver, and gray. The toa lhikan have black hands, red and gold. The gold isn't shine, is a another scheme of it. But the weapons are cool, not very playable with small bionicles, but can be a board too. The animal, kikanalo, have too claws, and some rahkshi parts to make a tail. The arms have black legs of metru. The toa also have gear systems, to makes moves like the toa metru. This is a awesome two in one set, very good!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Toa Lhikan is good except I don&#39;t like the shape of his mask. I also love his Kikanolo. I got this set used from&nbsp;Bricklink.&nbsp;I&nbsp;like the gold on his mask.</p>

"logeybear","2014-11-24T04:47:37.24Z","Legendary Toa of Fire","<p>Lhikan may be the single most important Toa in the BIONICLE saga.&nbsp; He was responsible for not only defending Metru Nui from the Dark Hunters before the rise of the Toa Metru, but he also created the Toa Metru to save the City of Legends after he himself retired from heroism and became a Turaga.&nbsp; The Lhikan and Kikanalo set was a special edition kit released in late 2004 as a tie-in with the movie BIONICLE 2: Legends of Metru Nui.&nbsp; It included a golden Toa Metru figure (back when gold was a rare color) and a huge rhinoceros beast for him to ride.&nbsp; The Kikanalo&rsquo;s design was way ahead of its time as it was the first humanoid to include legs with extra reinforcement (a feature that the rest of the &rsquo;04 titans lacked that became common in &rsquo;06).&nbsp; The set had many pros and very few cons.&nbsp; First was the play features.&nbsp; Lhikan had gear functions and articulated limbs (like the rest of the Metru), an exclusive remolded Hau, and had two huge greatswords that could be combined together on his feet to make a surfboard so he could fly like in the movie.&nbsp; Kikanalo could of course be ridden on by any Toa Metru figure (and stand up under their weight) and he came with many useful gray parts in case you wanted to take him apart.&nbsp; The only minor flaw with this set is that (spoiler) Lhikan never actually rides a Kikanalo in the movie, making his set confusing for those that have already seen it.&nbsp; Still, this is a very, very minor problem and shouldn&rsquo;t detract you from buying this incredible set.&nbsp; Go out and find one on eBay or Amazon, this is one of BIONICLE&rsquo;s best.</p>

"ThoughtLash","2015-08-04T21:11:00.94Z","The Greatest Toa of Metru Nui","<p>I got this set years ago when it came out. It has since been dissembled (years ago), but I remember it well.</p>

<p>Both Lhikan and his pet are accurate to the movie (Legends of Metru Nui), although Lhikan was a Turaga when the Toa Metru were riding Kikanalo...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Toa and beast came in a large cardboard box, like most BIONICLE Titans.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of useful Technic and BIONICLE parts, including Rahkshi leg pieces and Lhikan&#39;s torso, mask (a Great Hau, the mask of shielding), and swords. Lhikan was one of the last sets to use the old gold color, which switched to a brighter gold in 2006. One complaint, the Technic axle connecting one of Lhikan&#39;s swords to his hands snapped off, the only time that has ever happened to one of my BIONICLEs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures, but the figures are great.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t remember the build well, but I think it was medium difficulty. Lhikan is the same build as the other 7 Toa (Vakama, Matau, Onewa, Whenua, Nuju, Nokama, Norik and Iruini), but the Kikanalo is complex, like the 2001 Rahi.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like I said above, Lhikan&nbsp;is pretty much the same as the other 2004/early 2005 Toa. The Kikanalo is imposing, and film-accurate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this set if you can find it. The other Toa can be placed on the Kikanalo to recreate the scenes from the movie, or you can make up your own adventures from when Lhikan was a Toa.</p>
