It is quick and easy to build, as well as disassemble, so it offers excellent rebuild potential.  It only sports one function, the turning rotors, but their operation is smooth and satisfactory. 

Overall, despite being a simple set, I enjoyed this model.  It did not offer a great variety of parts, however, which limited its offering in terms of free-lance building.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Their is a seat to put a technic figure in the cockpit (to bad one is not include).  The other model to bulid is an airplane.  And when you role the wheels on the ground the propler will spin.  And, like other technic set their are instructions to hook up an electric motor, in this case it is for the helecopter to spin the blades on it.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
