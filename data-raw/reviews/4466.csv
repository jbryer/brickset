That alone makes it a great set. :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"paanjang16","2009-06-13T06:52:16.983Z","Simple but full of basic features","It might be a small set, but it has the basic features of any vehicles on the road like:-
1) Adjustable steering column with a simple steering mechanism for the wheels
2) One cylinder engine with a piston that goes up and down when the car is moved
3) Driver's seat with armrest
4) Exhaust pipe in the rear

For the alternative model we get a simple roller with rear steering.

A great small set to show how a steering in a car is used and how the piston is connected to the wheels by a crankshaft. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There are very few parts but still it ""does something"". I'm talking about the steering and the engine with its piston.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T22:09:36.003Z","My First Technic Set, My 175th Brickset Review","<p>Set #8815 Speedway Bandit: I am going to try to review this set so that the review will be helpful to readers, but I'm going to be 100% honest with the members of Brickset, despite this being my first ever Technic set I have very little recollections of it. The only reason why I even remember owning it in the first place is because of the unique Technic pieces, the flat number 1 white plate and the black Technic control seat, which I still have among my spare parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging by the pictures of this set I'd have to say it looks very fun and a great vintage Technic set. It appears to use a fairly limited number of pieces to build up either model and is quite unique looking compared to all my old Mini-Figure Theme sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Speedway Bandit automobile mode looks more like a high powered go-kart, without actually resembling a car. It appears to have real working suspension as part of the construction and the steering wheel looks like it controls the wheels motion so that you can turn it left or right. The red colored pieces make the set really pop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steamroller model appears to be great as well, I don't think I ever built this set into the alternate model however because I don't remember that... Actually I think I used this model only once and then absorbed the pieces into my spare parts for MOCing, I honestly don't think I liked the Technic sets enough hence why I never had any others until the Throwbots came out and I picked them up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though, upon reflection, I'm sure this set is a great little set and offers a lot of potential for Model makers who employ and enjoy Technic sets. The pieces were all new to me at the time and quite unique, so I'm going to recommend this set. As far as Technic sets go it looks fairly simple and easy to build, considering I had to be around ten years old at the time and built it without any problems I'd say it's a good set for that age range too. Perhaps I should consider picking it up again to have it on hand and perhaps edit this review when I do?</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
