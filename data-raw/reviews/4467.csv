The black/yellow/grey colorscheme works great for this model. It has working rear suspension, and the stearing mechanism is fully functional. I do feel it's i bit flimsy, and some of it falls apart easily, but generelly speaking, it's not a bad set.

Although i liked it as a kid, i didn't get into technic, i guess i just had way more fun with the ""regular"" Lego, wich could be played with, without risk of damaging it. :)

I think that it's a fine set, i loved it as a child, i still like it, although Technic never really became ""my thing"".

I give the set af 4/5, only because i'm not completely satisfied with the stability.

Seeing as how my experience with Technic at this moment, is limited to a few sets, you might consider drawing on your own experience before jumping head first onto Ebay and finding the set. This review is based on my own opinion, and should not be considered absolute.
