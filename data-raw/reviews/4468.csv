It has working steering, moving piston engine and looks great. When you push it along a 24-tooth gear turns a 8-tooth which is connected to a crankshaft which of course, moves a piston.The steering can some times be a bit stiff but a bit of force can fix it. I own a dune buggy and this own is nearly exactly like it. A person I know gave this big bucket of legowhich contained a load of old lego sets eg. 851 Tractor and 125CC Motorbike. When I realised this set was here I got an inventory of peeron, ticked all the pieces off and used the instructions off PICSL to build it. In the end I was very pleased with the result!
