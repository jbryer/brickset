"ratz","2008-03-20T17:28:25.45Z","old-school technic","in those many years i own this set, i only built it once - i really don't think it is too attractive. especially i dislike the rubber pats, which look more and more shabby as they age. 
on the other hand it surely is a solid, functional model, and provides you with some useful white technic beams. thats all the pros i can think of, really. its just nothing special.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"TechnicNick","2011-05-09T19:31:48.21Z","Unusual and Good Fun.","Sometimes it's good to see Lego do something less obvious.. this does make this kit less versatile than many others but there are some good parts here; those rubber bumpers (and there are lots of them) are especially rare.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The hovercraft looks good and works well - with a very authentic instability when making a turn! Shame about the stickers.. The blade does seem to turn rather slowly when pushed but it's easy enough to gear up for a more satisfying whooshing noise. Given this was released at about the same time as those poseable Technic figures and it's the right size, it's a surprise there isn't one here, but I can't really say I miss it...</div><div><br></div><div>As already mentioned, the second model is pretty poor - I guess that shows what a specialized thing a hovercraft is. You can't do a great deal else with this set but it's still a good one.</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
