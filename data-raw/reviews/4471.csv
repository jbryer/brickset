Pretty simple design - rotate the handle, and the blades spin.
It was cool that the back blade spins, too.

I didn't like the alternate model much, though.

I later got the motor (8720) to put in it - worked quite well.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I think I made the models in the instructions once each, then I threw the parts into my parts mix. Overall, it wasn't that special of&nbsp;a set, but did use the grey lift-arm pieces in a lot of my MOCs. Actually, I can't even recall that I liked the models that I made with this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be consistant with my general opinion of any set released circa 1990s and earlier, if you are looking for a set that you can play with, skip over it. Save it this one for the collectors. You'll get a lot more functionality, robustness, and useful parts out of a model released within the last decade than you will with this one.</p>",TRUE,3,5,2,2,3

<p>Released in 1990, this set seems to be a ""partner"" set for 8832. It uses the same color scheme (black parts, red seat, yellow details), it's scale is similar, box size and prices were identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The parts:</strong></p>
<p>We get some black technic bricks and standard plates, and no less than 14 liftarms 1x4, which still new and interesting parts in 1990.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The model:</strong></p>
<p>It looks simple-designed, but it looks like a helicopter. Main rotor and tail rotor can be&nbsp;driven manually, which is the only technical feature of this model.</p>
<p>The red seat allows to put a technicfig into the cockpit. But where to put it's legs ? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B-model:</strong></p>
<p>Quite interesting: The B-model is a small plane which adjustable wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This set is not a must-have. But it looks nice, the parts are useful. All in all, you can't go too wrong with it.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,4
