"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-10T04:41:17Z","Simple &amp; elegant functions - classic Technic","This model is very good for beginners. The bucket can be raised/lowered using 2 different controls (one to raise/lower another to tip it off). The worm wheel prevents bucket from falling over even under load.

The light over cab controls steering on rear wheels.

It's good value for money. I got mine only for &#163;2 from Ebay.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2008-08-22T11:58:49.903Z","Great set","This set, especially the above model of the two, it great. It is compact, yet you can just about do anyting with it. The steering is great using the yellow light on top, and you really can use the scoop for scooping up lego bricks! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aqualize","2010-01-07T05:59:47Z","Great little technic set","The wheel loader is a very good little set because it contains several Lego technic functions within it. The standard steering with a knob at the roof but also the raising/lowering of the bucket and tilting. Plus it can be fitted with electrical motor (extra Lego set).  The good thing is that the electrial motor will be used for raising and lowering the bucket, not driving the wheels like in many other technic models (I don't think it's funny with that, you have to use your other arm anyway on the model for steering while it drives).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
