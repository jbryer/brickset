"Loganwan","2008-02-28T21:58:56.95Z","Early On","This was a set that I had early in my Lego career.  I built the roadster, and I don't think I ever built anything else with it.  It stayed a roadster for nearly 20 years until it was dropped and fell apart.  It became parts for fun for a while, but I think it is time for it to go back to it's original glory.

The front steering that actually works, with a tilting steering wheel, and real suspension was a great touch.  These are all things that are pretty standard on the high quality of the Technic sets, but at the time it was outstanding.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This was probably the cheapest set to feature it, and I can imagine many boys like me wanting this set just for that.</div><div><br></div><div>Other than the suspension, it isn't that great of a parts donor.</div>",TRUE,1,2,1,3,3
"Crazy_Chris","2012-09-03T09:28:11.307Z","Nice little kart with interesting parts","Released in 1988, this little kart was one of the first small model (i.e. non-universal) sets.<br>So it is one of the grandfathers of todays technic entry-sets.<br>Before that, 8620, 1972 and 1924 had similar concepts.<br><br>Back to 8832: although consisting of only 86 parts, it offers steering, and adjustable steering column, and working rear suspension. It also offers a seat and a technicfig fits perfect into it. However, you had to take the technicfig from another set or buy the 3-fig set 8712.<br><br>8832 introduced some interesting new parts:<br>1. The Technic steering arm 6.5x2, which was mainly used in super cars like 8865 and 8880, and also in 8856 and 8412. The kart was the smallest and cheapest model that ever contained this part.<br>2. The improved steering system, mainly the improved steering rack holder. Later on, it should become a standard part for nearly all small cars and a basic part for nearly all small universal sets.<br><br>Summary: nothing spectacular, but from 1988's point of view, a very very interesting set. It looks good, it works well, and it contains some useful special parts.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2014-01-02T13:22:14.16Z","Elegant little car","<p>This little car is a brilliant showcase of what Technic used to be back in the late 80s. In only 86 parts you can build an elegant car with functional tilt steering and rear suspension. The color coordination of the set is outstanding and there is a nice variety of parts in it. Playbility-wise, the car is quite responsive and fun to drive around and learn how front-steering vehicles behave. The secondary model is nothing special, but still an interesting trike concept. I would recommend this set to all Technic fans looking for a great entry-level studded Technic set. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"h734802","2021-05-04T17:24:50.53Z","I got this","<p><strong>When I was a little boy I always wanted a Technic set.</strong> Actually I wanted the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8865-1"">8865 Test Car</a> but didn&#39;t get. <strong>For the first time I got this set</strong> instead.</p>

<p>Long time after I could borrow and play with the 8865. Of course that was a higher feeling than dealing with the Roadster, but now I supposed to write about this set. Anyway that time the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8880-1/Super-Car"">8880 Super Car</a> was already released, but I didn&#39;t want that anymore because I stopped being interested in Lego &larr; this is not really true...</p>

<p>Okay, nowadays (or some years ago) I was getting to be interested in more and more my long time awaited Technic set(s), and I bought <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9398-1"">9398 Crawler 4x4</a> because of the look and the remote control, then <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42115-1"">42115 Lamborghini Si&aacute;n</a> because of the look and the inside (and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42100-1/Liebherr-R-9800"">42100</a> because of the look of course and the functions).</p>

<p>But getting back to our main subject: cars, cars, cars, Technic, Technic, Technic, today I wish I was a car repair man... Maybe this set started me in life getting technical.</p>

<p>That is why <strong>I would offer this set for every little kid who wants lego. Maybe it would have the effect on him or her to be something related. Of course, it is a vintage set but if somebody wants to buy something not average set for a kid, just compare the nowadays&#39; sets to this one and choose. </strong>I need to get it back to the shelf from the box in the attic.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p><strong>Minimal number of pieces are built together on maximum usage. For the minimalists also it is a must-have set.</strong> By the way the suspension works more realistic with a heavy object in the seat.</p>

<p>Con</p>

<p>Maybe the size...</p>
