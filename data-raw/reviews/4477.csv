On the one hand, it looks really good. The color scheme works great, and its design is compact and relatively realistic.

But the most important thing on a forklift - THE LIFTING OF THE FORK - does not work quite well.

A lifting chain is used to pull the carriage with the two forks up and down. The carriage is wrapped around the mast and should glide along it as the chain pulls it. However, there is too much friction between the carriage and the mast, and a small bit of backlash. This usually results in pulling the carriage sideways a bit, which then gets stuck. Applying more force then results in the gearwheels skipping without the carriage moving up or down.

So, a big design flaw which ruins the playability. But it looks good on the shelf. 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
