"Matthias_K","2016-11-06T17:32:51.163Z","Another good looking plane","<p>My brother had this set when we were kids and this was always the set I envied the most. Mostly because I really like planes, but I actually think this a very good looking one. Well, except for the ugly yellow seat,&nbsp;which I immediately replaced with a red one.</p>

<p>In terms of functions, this plane is fine as well. It obviously&nbsp;misses the elevator controls, but it has enough functions for it&#39;s size.</p>

<p>On to the B-model.&nbsp;Although an auto-gyro is an immensely interesting concept in real-life, it does not translate to an interesting Technic model. It mostly feels like a standard Technic helicopter with even less functions.</p>

<p>All in all, I feel this is a very nice plane in the Technic line.</p>
