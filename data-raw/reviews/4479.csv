Both the truck and the excavator looks and (best of all) works great.  

If you are entering the technic an/or pneumatic world, this is a very good starter set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

</ul>

<p>(This is my fourth review on excavators from the list.)</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This set was released during my dark ages. I got mine about ten years later from ebay. Until set 42053 from 2016 it has been the only technic excavator using wheels. It features large and small pneumatic cylinders that have two air inlets, e.g. those that would now be referenced as pneumatic system V1.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>From the list above this is the smallest model. It has same red-and-grey colour scheme as 8851 set from 1984.<br />
I believe it&#39;s about the scale of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/tag-Technic-Figs"" title=""Technic figures"">technic figures</a> and goes well with other sets from this area, for example the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8872-1"">8872</a>.</p>

<p>Besides <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8443-1"" title=""set 8443"">set 8443</a> this is the only set (as far as I know) that uses rigid tubes for pneumatics.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>The arm can be raised and lowered by the large cylinder. The shovel is operated by a small one. Pneumatic is supplied by a manually operated pump.</p>

<p>There is no bending of the boom as in 8851, 8043, 42006, or 42053. Therefore playability is limited as in 8294 excavator.</p>

<p>There is steering of a wheel pair operated from the yellow warning light that is transmitted through the center of the large turning plate. Superstructure can be turned by means of this, but there is no extra lever or transmission to it.</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>This a nice compact model that is, compared to its size, full of functions. I like the steering control by the flashlight better than the control from 42053 model where you have a cogwheel on the back of the carriage.</p>

<p>Playability is limited by (small) size of the arm. I prefer this set over 8294.</p>
