So, this is overall a small (only 243 parts) yet great set, and I'm sure I'll get myself some more motorcycles whenever I can :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sabpol","2007-07-12T23:37:59.217Z","Challenging build","This is the most challenging to build of all my Technic/Expert Builder sets, challenging despite my over 30 years of building LEGO sets.  I would not recommend this set to someone who has no experience putting a LEGO set together.  

There are several spots where you have to get things like gears and the spacing between pieces exactly right or else the set won't work.  It's a little tricky holding the cycle in your hands while snapping grouped pieces into place without collapsing it.

What drew me to buy this set (over 10 years ago) was wondering how the designer got a chain propeled by a wheel to drive a 2-piston engine.  It's designed well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

When I lost my interest of lego I did understand it would be good to retain the packaging,manual and all parts in the box. 

So there it was this evening, stil sitting in the box waiting in anticipation to be built again. and done so it was, I still think it is a clever design, all aspects of the bike are functional exept for the radiator cooling package, but even today that function does not exist in lego sets.

The set is to ressemble a 2-stroke off road motercycle, and it does the job very well. 

I Think this set is worthwhile getting if you are into Technic. I am just glad I didn't get rid of all my lego when I lost interest. Now it is so much fun to rebuild all those sets from their original boxes.

"DrFrankenstein","2012-10-06T23:23:30.907Z","Not the best Technic motorcycle ever, but still a classic","<p>The Shock Cycle is a classic example of early 90s Technic sets. While it doesn't sport the more polished looks of its modern studless cousins, it does have the profile of a good dirt bike. For the small set that it is (half the pieces of 8420 and 8051) it does pack a punch functionality-wise making clever use of angled construction techniques, shock springs, and even a 2 cylinder engine. There are some issues with the design though that are hard to dismiss.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>High nostalgia value of a well-known classic Technic set</li><li>Clever use of a relatively limited number of bricks</li><li>Has all the functions one would expect from a first-class Technic bike</li><li>Innovative for its time<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The engine runs stiff due to tight spacing around the piston arms<br></li><li>The kick-stand rubber-banded retraction mechanism doesn't work well<br></li></ul>
<p>Even though the modern Technic motorcycles surpass this early model in looks, stability, and ruggedness, this set stand out on its own the test of time. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to build a collection of classic Technic models. It's not a great toy, but makes for a nice display piece IMHO.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,5
