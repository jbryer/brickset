It cost about 25â‚¬ and was worth it. And I had to wait at the cashpoint for more than 30mins, because many people bought things on that day.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Models:
1. Dune Buggy:
This is a little and clunky dune buggy with a 2-cylinder engine in the back. The back is connected to the model by some shock absorbers. There's a seat in it that fits the technic figure into it easily. The model is steerable, but that's common to Technic vehicles.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Rally van: This model is a rally van, which engine is connected like in the main model. There's the seat for the Technic Figure, but where is the Steering wheel. There's even a static one missing in the cab. As the other model it is steerable, but only through a mechanism. The empty back can easily modified by putting two seats into the back.So this fits up to 3 Figures.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Overall: A good medium sized set with an engine and a Technic figure.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There's not a lot to this set really, what you see is what you get, but that doesn't matter because what it has got, it does very well. Rear wheel drive and a tidy little two cylinder engine that's actually rather smooth, plus the new tyres fit it very well. Super fun for a rainy afternoon, you'll have built both models within a couple of hours, no problem. Get one if you can, it'll be worth it!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"TechnicNick","2011-08-19T19:36:30.88Z","Oddly Named But Quite Good","I'd call this some kind of Dune Buggy maybe....&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>It's a nice looking thing, if a little chunky - sturdy too. It does have one fundamental problem. The crankshaft of the engine, as built in the instructions of my early version, is only supported on one side; making the engine decidedly lumpy. Would an engineer build an engine with only one main bearing ? If he did, stand well back and wait for the explosion...</div><div><br></div><div>This is easily fixed - change one solid black brick for one with a hole and substitute one crankshaft piece in place of a half bush and it's done. The engine is now smooth. Given that, I can only ask why was it ever like this in the first place ? I guess Lego themselves corrected this in later versions, as a previous reviewer commented on the engine's smoothness in his copy.</div><div><br></div><div>Apart from that, this is a sweet little vehicle with lots of that old studded Technic character I like so much. The second model is nice as well. It's a good way to give yourself a quick fix of good old fashioned building fun. Just don't make the engine quite as it is in the instructions...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
