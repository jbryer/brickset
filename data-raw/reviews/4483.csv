I was about 5 years old back then..  and was amazed by the features of lego technic.
This set is sooo  very retro,  that people simply have no choice but to appreciate it  :",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It failed miserably to take the place of the delightful 854 Go-Kart, whose combination of simplicity, playability and good looks was advanced not one iota by this.<div><br></div><div>Even the feature count remained the same, and it looked worse; kind of unfinished somehow, especially at the front.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the features, the engine was driven by one wheel, in the manner of 854, but without that model's gearing up or second crankshaft gear; making it difficult to set up to run smoothly at it's (much slower) speed. It can be done though, if you're precise. The steering, using the newer plates with holes at each end was better and stronger but this doesn't make up the ground lost by the engine's inadequacies.</div><div><br></div><div>In fairness, this is a small set with relatively few pieces; but then 854 wasn't huge either.

"BigLegoKid","2017-01-06T15:36:38.01Z","Interesting but not quite poliched","<p>As another review here pointed out the go-Kart like model seems as if it was in an unfinished state when compared to others. However, I view this go-kart/buggy as the kind that you would build from crap parts and an old lawn mower engine. Not every thing was fit and finished because those karts/buggies where about the fun not the finish.</p>

<p>This set had one big draw back when i was a kid. Due to the way the steering&nbsp;was positioned inside the cart it made playing with it odd. It was fine at low speeds but when playing with it at higher speeds the front windshield frame&nbsp;got in the way. So i removed it and that raised the play ability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I got a lot more use out of the second model of the tractor.&nbsp;</p>
