"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T21:45:49Z","Classic (for me)","This is perhaps my first technic Lego model, so it is a classic to me :) Lots of fun and ideas from this model. It is a simple design, easy to build - and it can be fitted with the older Lego electrical motor system. :)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2008-10-30T13:05:03.873Z","Never meet your heroes","  I'd always admired this set from afar for quite sometime, and then the opportunity arose to buy it on ebay, which I duly did.  The premise is really very good to be honest, but the outcome is a little lack-lustre. I like the broad wheels, they're a nice touch but the front ones tend to bind on the steering arms. Another flaw, if you can call it that, is how the racing number is held on, you only have to look at it and it'll fall off. The same goes for a couple lampholder bricks that connect onto the &quot;exhaust&quot;. Other than that it's not actually a bad model for it's size, but the bad points do let it down a little.  No great loss if you don't have it, but good chance for some tweeking.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TechnicNick","2012-07-15T11:37:43.9Z","Good Rather Than Great","After the sketchy and rather basic 8841, the endlessly popular theme of the Technic Go-Kart - there always seems to be one, doesn't there ? - took a turn for the better with this in 1986.<div><br></div><div>A little more thought seems to have gone into this one, and it has an individuality that most other sets of this type lack. The offset seat with the engine beside it is a nice touch, although this would have been better still with the steering wheel pointing at the centre of the seat...</div><div><br></div><div>Building it is easy enough; real Technic-heads would need a bigger set to get a proper fix; but the finished article is at least satisfying, and playable. There's a lot of nice touches here, like the bars around the sides and at the front, the very robust yet simple way the steering column is mounted; the fact that with a bigger gear than usual acting on the rack, the steering has a great flick-wrist action; all this and the more than adequate wheels (for a change!) add up to a good model.</div><div><br></div><div>There are flaws. Nothing major - the engine turns too slowly (again) but this is easily fixable - just redesign the seat back slightly to accommodate the bigger gear on the driving axle this needs - and the front tyres are prone to rubbing on the rack carrier when steering lock is applied. Still, be thankful there's enough lock for a change...</div><div><br></div><div>I didn't bother with the second model - it looks perfectly hideous and does very little, but at least there's enough pieces here to make your own little red... something or other.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this doesn't quite scale the heights of sheer playability and fun that the dear old 854 reached so effortlessly, but it's not a bad effort.</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"Jayneflakes","2013-10-22T07:43:24.093Z","A classic piece","Like many others, I had this set as a kid and as I ""grew up"" swapped it in preference for heavy metal records and beer. Now as I enter my forties, I thought why not get my old hobby back and to my delight discovered that Lego is just as much fun as it always was.<div><br></div><div>This was my first vintage set after buying up lots of new studless models and you can see that time and memory has been kinder to the model than it should have been. Studded models just do not have the flash feel that studless has, but what it does have though is charm and lots of it.</div><div><br></div><div>The build was more complicated than I remember and the instructions were harder to follow than the modern equivalent, I guess that we were tougher back then! It was great fun though and once it was together it looked fine, despite a couple of missing pieces. The big square engine does not have the elegance of the smaller round piston models, but it is still a nice feature.</div><div><br></div><div>The B model though is frankly rubbish, it looks like the sort of thing put together by a five year old and has the looks of confused building that just wanted to use as many parts as they could, even if they look wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>So with it built up and looking cool, I was happy enough to have it on display, well until I got bored and dismantled it for the bits to use on MOCs. the parts do need a wash though, twenty odd years of dust do show up, but then after twenty years it looks in better condition that I do, too much heavy metal and beer I suspect.</div>",TRUE,4,3,5,3,4
