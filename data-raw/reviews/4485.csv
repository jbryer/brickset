Anyway, I struggled with building it since I never had a pneumatic set before. At one point I even threw it in the wall (ashamed), but continued building and finished it. The fork-lifting system was a bit jerky, but it could as well have been my lack of skills :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sarin","2007-02-19T04:27:33.31Z","","I too got this one for my birthday, I remember being all excited about the pneumatic system (which really was an innovation at that time).
I had to go to school the next day, and i couldn't wait to get home just to play with my new technic set.
This set comes with a wide variety of technic parts, such as chain links, pneumatic cylinders and several beams and axles.

I didn't like the 2nd model though.... when i first built it, i didn't even know what it was. (I believe it is meant to be some sort of tow-truck).

I doubt that this set is still available somewhere, you have to be really lucky to find one in good condition, because the pneumatic parts on this set are discontinued.
For the technic builder who is in search of parts, this one isn't recommendable because of this, but for the nostalgious collectors among us, this set is certainly a must-have",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Crazy_Chris","2012-08-14T06:42:56.9Z","Sorry, but it never really worked","In Lego Technic history, the year 1984 was an important milestone: Lego introduced the first generation of the pneumatic system:<br>- Universal set 8040<br>- forklift 8843<br>- exvacator<br><br>Obviously, the universal set was the pneumatic starter kit, while the exvacator was the pneumatic flagship set. So, 8843 seems to be the golden middle: just a little bit more expensive than 8040, but a ""real"" model like 8851.<br><br>The color scheme isn't very exciting: yellow, red, some black and some gray. But we're interested in the pneumatic system: 8843 was the first of only two sets ever released, that used the large pneumatic cylinder (the other set is 8680).<br><br>If integrated into a proper mechanic design, the first generation pneumatic system works pretty good. Both 8040 and 8851 prove this. But 8843, I never managed to get it working as designed. Moving the forklift upwards is no problem, but moving downwards is flawed: the pneumatic cylinder moves downwards, but the forks don't follow. I tried to improve the situation by adjusting all mechanical parts in detail, but without success.<br><br>Even the steering doesn't work without flaws. The position of the ""hand of god"" is weak, and the axles change their directions multiple times. The steering wheel which is located within the driver's cabin, touches the pneumatic hoses.<br><br>So, no positive aspects regarding 8843 ? Of course, not. But it is a non-technic part: 8843 was the first ever set to contain part nr. 4504, better known as ""1x6 hinged plate"". It used to appear in several town and castle sets later on. <br>Moreover, some models shown in idea book 8889, use several parts of 8843.<br><br>Summary: my vote goes to the parts, but not to the model.<br>If you would like to build a classic 1st genration pneumatic model, go for 8851 instead.<br>",TRUE,2,5,5,2,3

I like the design of this set from the front to the back. However, the forklift should be at least two colors all around. Besides that, this set isn't bad at all.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
