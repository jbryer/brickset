"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T13:03:59Z","Blue Thunder","All right, so it looks nothing like the helicopter from the movie with the same name (I think that movie actually came out around the same time I got the 8844, spring of 1982).  In my mind it was the same chopper though, simply because of the first thing that hit me about the set (lots of blue pieces).  I did my best to add a rotary cannon to the front like the copter in the movie, but could never get the cannon to easily run off the main rotor drive.  

What makes the 8844 notably different feature-wise from its predecessor 852 is not its remarkable ability to scare cats, but rather the retractable landing gear.  While building this kit, I usually have to fuss with the landing system (chain links and gears) a bit before it’s aligned the way that I want it.  It’s worth the trouble, as the helicopter looks great once the gear is set properly.  The main and small rotors spin well, idling slowly to a stop when power is no longer supplied.  This set feels somewhat fragile, but that just adds to the feel of authenticity (most small helicopters look kind of delicate to me).

The 8844 is a good set.  It is an essential piece for your Lego collection, providing an obvious link in the helicopter chain of evolution (see other sets 8856, 8412, 852, 8444), much like the development seen in the Technic supercar sets over time.  Lots of aerial fun.  10/10, 29 April 2004

"superjohn","2008-09-23T09:59:32.153Z","My last ever Lego set","Maybe it was because I already owned such greats as 850, 851, 856 and 8860. Maybe it was because 8844 was a bit spindly and delicate. Maybe it was because it didn't really look like a helicopter.  Maybe it was because I was almost a teenager when I got it.

I don't know the reason, but somehow this kit never EXCITED me like the other Technic sets.

Building it was great fun, you didn't have any idea why there were so many cogs and chains and stuff inside until a couple of pages from the end, and then the realisation hit that it had retractable landing gear.  But I can't help thinking this was just an attempt to stick more Technic bits in for the sake of it.  After all, did you ever actually SEE a real small helicopter like this one with retracting landing gear?

I recently rebuilt this kit with my 7 year old son, he thought it was great, so maybe I'm just old and cynical.  But he found, just like I did, that the instrument panel constantly falls off, and the model is a little unwieldy to play with.  The novelty of turning the handle and watching the blades spin lasts about 20 seconds.  Compare that to how much fun you get from a car with working steering.

Maybe I'm just not a helicopter guy....",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2011-02-23T10:38:13.643Z","First Technic.","&nbsp;This was the first ever Technic set I ever owned. I bugged my mum and dad for weeks to get me this set. Imagine my surprise, when on that Christmas morning all those years ago, I found this set waiting under the tree! Bearing in mind I was only five when this came out, it took me and my dad the whole of Christmas day to build this. The epic struggle was not in vain, as this is a brilliant set. It is quite amazing, if you think about it, that you can get a functioning helicopter out of such limited parts. This was released only about four years after the introduction of Technic, and was a relatively cheap buy compared to some of the other sets available at the time. The set itself is not that much of a difficult model to assemble, once you get the hang of it, because the instructions aren't all that clear. As said in other reviews, it does take a bit of tweeking to get the undercarriage to align properly, but that's half the fun in my view. I recentley rebuilt mine after finding some instructions on ebay, and the joy has not left this charming pioneer at all. Another classic rainy afternoon set from the golden age of Lego. Well done.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Hitokiri_2000","2021-04-28T13:58:17.887Z","Great set with a few nice features.","<p>I don&#39;t have much to add to what other reviewers have not already written.</p>

<p>I will tell people that the time it takes&nbsp;making the retracing function of the wheels work properly is well worth the effort.</p>

<p>But&nbsp;I will also make a note that switching the No. 6 axle for a No. 4 for the rear wheel in the final step (19) in the assembly guide&nbsp;will make it slightly more stable, and it also fits better when pulled up/retracted into the fuselage. Try it, if it doesn&#39;t work for you just change it back to how it originally was.</p>

It introduced me to all the cool stuff you can do with technic, but sadly that was my only one. It is a nifty little set that illustrates a bunch of mechanical principles and building techniques.</p>

<p>Compared to modern sets, this is of course a studded design, and there are no special parts you can no longer get equivalents for, but it does have one sub-system that has been phased out:</p>

<p>I had such a love hate relationship with this part. Used in the canopy, it could make a variety of angles. Sadly the little teeth are very fragile and prone to crumbling off. In modern sets you&#39;d buy stronger but fixed joints that can give you different angles.</p>
