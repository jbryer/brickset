A little difficult to play with with the roll cage in place as it was difficult to get at the steering because of it.  Seriously hopped when you play with it though.  The first set I had that used the more modern steering system.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T08:17:31Z","Shocking great","That's an oldi. I still got all the parts en the booklet and haven't build it for some years but I have very fond memories of this little car. Simple to build but great to play with, especially the bounce. How high will it fly before it breaks. To memory, the only lego to ever fall off the kitchen tabel and survive. Only the sideboards? wetre a little fragile. All in all a great car.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:20:13Z","Bouncy little truck","Remember those Dodge Neon &quot;Hi&quot; advertisements seen on TV and in various magazines about ten years ago? The 8845 has that same feel to it. It is a cheery little set, just right for getting your Lego fix on when you don't have a whole lot of free time. It's got a bunch (relatively speaking, given the small size of the set) of nifty parts, too. 

The 8845 is not complex to build or motorize, but it's still a ton of fun once built. It doesn't break the bank, either (I bought mine new, along with the 8846 tow truck, in Germany in early 1983. Total cost for the two sets was about 100DM).

"sabpol","2007-11-17T19:40:12.077Z","Very Basic Technic Set","I was never too impressed with this set.  All it has going for it is the shock absorbers on each of the rear axles and working steering.  The only gears in this set are associated with steering.  If you want to build a vehicle with some kind of working functions other than steering, you won't be able to do it.  You'll have a lot more building possibilities using gears and pistons if you get the Go-Cart #948 instead. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Lexhoya","2010-07-26T07:37:41.657Z","Blast from the past","Oldie goldie. Can remember that this set was really cool with the 'pf' 
of that time. That electric engine was not too good though, since it slipped 
of the shaft all the time, but it was fun driving around. If I can 
recall correctly this was my first Technic set, had to wait untill I was
 10 to actually get it for my birthday. After building it, it was fun playing outside, but as is mentioned earlier: steering is the only moving part and the shocks were nice to have.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"TechnicNick","2010-12-13T18:44:46.777Z","Basic Fun.","<p>This is a sweet little car, but it lacks any real technic pizazz. In it's defence, the newer steering parts that (I think) debuted with this are an improvement and the finished vehicle is great fun to bounce around and easy to motorize. It's light weight helps here, too.</p><p>Maybe it's because I was nearly in my teens when I first got it, but there never seemed to be enough here to engage the seasoned technic builder. However, it would make a fine introduction for the technic novice with a robust little vehicle to show for his efforts..</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4
"fhansson","2011-10-13T06:20:37.91Z","Alright fun but not much technics.","This was one of the very first models I got and it was fun since I have only played with regular Lego before. The suspension and steering are the only ""technical"" about it and it works alright. I think the best thing about this set is that it could be rebuilt into a lot of other cars using your imagination. If you already have lots of other Lego parts this is a good complement to build more advanced cars.",FALSE,3,3,2,4,3
"2_Cold_Technica","2014-03-07T14:03:10.593Z","My First Technic Set","<p>I got this set for Christmas when I was just 6 and played with it for hours and hours. Its easy to build but looks good and is very bouncy on its suspension. I now own two with one which I have modified any number of times and one which is near mint in box. Sets like this are great to introduce kids to Technic with enough features to make them interesting and a very strong build which won&#39;t fall apart during enthusiastic play.</p>
