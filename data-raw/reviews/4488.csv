Going from front to rear, the 8846 has:  a working winch, steering (from the cab and from the remote), rolling wheels, car cradle lift, and rear hook.  I hate to ruin the movie ending for you, but the winch is operated by the spare tire, and the remote steering is operated by the radio antenna.  (I think that’s what took this set over the top for me in winter 1982 – not only is it functional, but some of the utilities have &quot;hidden&quot; manipulators, not giving up their secrets easily.  Friends would come over and not immediately discern that the winch regulator was the spare tire.  Have I gone off about this stealthy-control stuff enough?  What I mean to say is, the 8846 is VERY cool.  It’s even OK that the 8846 is yellow.)  It’s also very solid, having survived many a shelf dive without coming apart.

The 8846 is a magnificent set.  Add the 8845 and a variation on the 854 for more same-scale towing/car care fun.  10/10, 29 April 2004

Lots to play with, very functional and still looked cool. If the truck was a Unimog, this was clearly a Landrover! It was solid, well-proportioned, had lots of functions and looked great towing other Technic cars of the same scale. The only reason I didn&#39;t give it a five star rating is that in mine, in 1982, a couple of pieces broke. (The hinge pieces in the windscreen and the right angle peg and hole connectors in the pickup frame). Also, I think it is amazing that this great looking truck was built from blocks, gears and rods - not shaped panels and bionicle bits.</p>

There's much to delight here...<div><br></div><div>Building it is fairly straightforward - it is an '80s set after all - but this set does demonstrate how much it's possible to pack in while using the old stuff. Many newer sets of this size are no more functional; sometimes less. One thing to note is to take care not to allow the steering pinion's axle to protrude too far forward, else it'll foul the inner crownwheel of the front winch assembly leading to sticky steering. Avoid this and you'll have a highly playable model at the end of an enjoyable build.</div><div><br></div><div>Steering is by what looks like a radio antenna sticking out of the roof - the first Lego model to do this by so-called 'Hand of God'. It was hooked up to the cab's wheel too, via an elastic band which does slip but hey, at least they tried... And would the designers of today's sets please observe just how much lock this has...</div><div><br></div><div>The lowering platform for carrying it's load is nicely done and works well, and will perform it's intended function - but it could do with being a little longer when down. I know, I'm really nit-picking now..</div><div><br></div><div>The winches at each end are great, and operating the front one via the spare tyre is a masterstroke. The catch on the rear one is a slight irritation but worm gears weren't yet with us at this point. I'm nit-picking again.</div><div><br></div><div>For some reason, there's a differential between the rear wheels although they don't drive anything. Still, it's nice to have.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a delightful model that's a joy to build and play with. One of my favourites. It is expensive these days, though, due to it's relative rarity. It's worth it - or build one up from your collection, it uses mostly basic pieces after all. And enjoy!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,3
