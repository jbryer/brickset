"Crazy_Chris","2012-08-15T18:47:12.273Z","The dragster !","From today's point of view, this set isn't very special at all.<br>In 1983, it must have been very appealing, due to the following reasons:<br><br>- it was the first technic set ever that contains white technic bricks<br><br>- it contains 2 big ""unimog"" wheels (at least I call them ""unimog"" wheels because of set 8848)<br><br>- and it contains more useful special parts, like hinge bricks and 1x3 slope bricks<br><br>The features are rather standard: steering and a working 2-cylinder engine.<br>But the overall design of this set is well done.Even compared to the first Model Team sets released in '86, the dragster really looks fine.<br><br>Finally, this set keeps a mystery: officially, it has been released as an US-only set in 1983.<br>But in 1984, it has been released in Germany, too. Not within the official line-up, but it has been sold as an exclusive item at a certain toy store chain called ""Idee &amp; Spiel"". I uploaded a picture of the 1984 Idee &amp; Spiel catalog at brickshelf:<br>http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=5344307<span></span><br><br>Summary: 8847 is not a ""must-have""-set. But i's nice-to-have, in the truest sense of the word.<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"BigLegoKid","2017-01-06T16:01:26.143Z","This was the must have set back in the day","<p>Got this set for Christmas one year and it was THE BEST! Back then my dad and by association me where huge drag racing fans so this set hit a special spot or me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was also the first time and still the only differential&nbsp;and &quot;timing chain&quot; that i have. I know its not really &nbsp;a timing chain but that&#39;s how its used in this model and i like that detail even though it didn&#39;t really do any thing. The use of colors was a nice touch as compared to other sets of the day. accept for the yellow exhaust&nbsp;pipes. Gray ones would have been better in my opinion.</p>

<p>I had the same issues as others with this set where there where clear weakness in the steering&nbsp;linkage. I do not remember&nbsp;if my instructions came with the supplemental&nbsp;instructions&nbsp;to beef up the linkage. I do recommend&nbsp;it though.</p>

<p>The second model in this set was also nicely refined and fun to build and play with.</p>
