"Novelty","2007-04-21T08:14:06.663Z","Ghost car","This is one of the few town sets without a minifig.  The vehicle isn't too bad, but it seems incomplete somehow.  Also, there are quite a number of odd angles and the proportion of the whole vehicle just makes it look odd.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-06T21:27:56.607Z","Why did I buy this set....?","Oh right, it's because I was six at the time when Legos were Legos and money was...well, generally not available.  I think it's considered to be part of the Town collection but find it a rather pointless set because there is no minifigure.  Moreover the wheels are at different heights and there is no back to the car; it's like only the front half is there.  If you don't own this set, you're not missing anything.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-07T12:06:58.27Z","Police Cruiser","This little car is a true classic to me. The size style and lack of mini-fig say &quot;hey I'm classic&quot;. This particular model was released as a box in stores and in a polly bag through a competition with the Kellogs Fruit Loops. I know as I had the box then won the polly bag. Unfortunately my mum put the polly bag inside the box, sealed it and took it back so I could have a different model.

Anyway down to the review. Well really it's a white police car with yellow lights and black undercarriage and interior. It has the old school windshield and small tires. The model itself is NOT unlevel but the front guard is 1/3 of a brick or a flat piece higher than the back.

The tires do seem too small for this model but hey as i said its a classic. I just can't seem to pick on this model for some reason. It just has a charisma that only someone born in the 80's would understand.

Look overall its a good little model and deserves no less than a 5/10. Great model for any classic collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-10-16T16:51:11.32Z","Police Mini-Buggy Seeks Mini-Getaway Car","<p>Well here is another mini-vehicle which is good for pocket money, not so great in design, but better for lack of a minifigure</p>

<p><b>White</b><b> Power</b><br />
That is, it provides a vehicle for those loose minifigures (of which there are many) who require transport, in this case a Police buggy or off road type mini-jeep.</p>

<div>It is not a great vehicle but will keep kids happy and completes a Town/City Police collection. The bricks are fine and the design is sort of fun but with something lacking.&nbsp;For want of a better police car, it would be worth saving your pennies for more realistic models and for any better vehicle generally as this set is not a great one.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>An alternative build to improve is questionable: bomb disposal tank? I would though, promote sets without the inclusion of minifigures however as some swear that the pesky things reproduce- don&#39;t turn your back on them.</div>

"Citizen_Piper","2011-08-23T00:59:52.427Z","police car with modern twist","This police car may seem incomplete...no mini figure and no roof. But to those who are familiar with the optimism of the 80's when the movie ""back-to-the-future"" was released...this police car says it all. I myself bought this car for the parts used...back then the short windshield was only available for airplanes but for stylish reasons it was for used for this police car.&nbsp; Small but sleek may come to mind when deciding to buy this set. <br>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
"Parrotman707","2011-04-11T15:19:36.5Z","A Nice Little Car","I think that this set is one of a slight number of town themed sets that did not come with a minifig. Although this isn't such a huge problem because if you have a lego town like me, you'll probably have a policeman or two. The car looks strange as the wheels are at different angles and the back looks incomplete somehow. It is a very easy set to build and the ideas on the back of the box all look somewhat decent.",FALSE,3,2,1,3,3
"James83","2013-01-05T06:40:44.27Z","Can you ever have too many Police cars?","<p>I remember getting this in a promotional offer, I think with Typhoo tea. It's small but cute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>This sporty little vehicle is a simple build but offered a few nice touches. The sloped front integrated bonnet and wheel arch unit was fairly rare but looked very sporty. The lights underneath looked good. The small handle brick serves a back-rest and also looks ok. The higher rear wheel also gave a sporty look but was also a little odd. The side bricks with Police on them were printed and the low windscreen looked great too.</p><p>There was no minifigure but as an extra vehicle it didn't need one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>My first mod was to add two round blue light bricks on top of the windscreen (a policecar without blue lights is odd) and two red sqaure lights at the back. Eventually though I replaced the printed Police bricks with plain ones and it became a sports car. That is really what this set should have been, a sports car in perhaps red or yellow rather than a policecar. For the low price this was an excellent addition.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,4
