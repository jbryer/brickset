I Have attempted to build copies from pictures alone but never succeded. Only through the power of the 'net that I have been able to own one and it only cost me 23 pounds sterling this year!
I was slightly apprehensive as I didn't want to be dissaponted by a childhood hero being duff......but how wrong I could be, this is just as good, if not better, in the flesh as it is in my old catalogue. I LOVE IT. The lever actions are great, even better after a little tweaking of lever arm ratios, the steering is a pain, the body is too heavy, especially considering the position of the steering wheel, but hey that's nothing......

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-03T16:32:23Z","POWERRRRRR","I got this one back in the eighties. Can't remember if I got it or if I bought it myself. But I know I had loads of fun building it. I really liked the scoop up front, although you had to remove the roof to handle it or steer.
The parts that I really liked were the big wheels. And the colours were unbeattable (just like 8845 Dune Buggy). I recently went to Bricklinck for the inventory list and I still got all the pieces, now all I have to do is find the instructions and build. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, I'm ready!!!!!For oldshool technic fans, this is a musthave!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:23:34Z","Good things come in small packages","&quot;Cool, look at those smally funky chunky tires&quot; -- verbatim quote from Kevin (the other Legomaniac in the German village where my family lived in the early 1980s) upon perusing the new catalog and spying the 8848. I finally got my 8848 Unimog in early 1982 or 1983, after unsuccessfully trying to talk my parents into buying it for me as a Paris-trip souvenir. 

What an awesome set. As if the 8848's crazy little-but-big tires were not enough, this set came with so many functions that it must have stolen functionality from future Technic sets (from the 1990s and 2000s). It looks great, feels solid, and is easy to build and fun to play with. The rear tipping bed and implement actuators for the front, combined with tight steering, a differential, and new-generation (back then) Technic pieces quickly made this one a favorite. 

The 8848 is a little bit heavy in the front, but building a low-boy trailer (for it to haul my 856 bulldozer around) helps keep the unimog's back tires on the ground. It would have been nice if the 8848 came with an engine (making motor sounds when no one is around might suffice temporarily). Lego would have been challenged to fit an early-80s technic Lego engine, even a two-cylinder, into this small kit! At least with the wild-and-wooly new pieces available today, it is not too difficult to hook up a small inline engine in the 8848. 

Someday I'll get an 8854 Crane Truck for comparison purposes. For now though, the 8848 is an outstanding set with something good for everybody.

I wasn't even aware that my old stash of legos  contained this model, eventhough I was using parts from this set all along, such as the differential.
My dad bought this set somewhere in '81,  and i'm from '82  so that makes it that today i'm using parts that are actually older then I am :)
Eventhough this model is old, you cannot tell which parts are from this set, and which are from the later sets (until '99).
The pieces still fit like they where fabricated yesterday, so this model is not only a standard for technic functionality, but for quality as well.

The working levers inside the cabin work quite well, and the ability to convert the model with other functions makes this an all-time classic.
There's only one (small) flaw on this model, and that's the location of the steering wheel.
But other then that, this truck is a superb design for an '81 lego.

Later I tried to modify this truck with a piston engine and pneumatics, though it worked... it really messed op the looks of the truck (especially the engine did).
Maybe somebody is able to modify it without damaging the cosmetic features, but for me, this model is just perfect the way it is

"fhansson","2011-10-13T06:30:03.02Z","Flexible!","It's hard to put a name on this other than some sort of truck with a front scope. As such it is alright to build and play around with. What is really interesting about this set is the use of differential gears! Very cool and impressive. The steering is placed under the roof(?) which is not so good. I think I spent more time playing with the differential gears building gearboxes and like more than the actual truck. This set includes a big number of ""standard parts"" that can be used for anything else which is what I think Lego is all about.",FALSE,4,4,3,4,4
