Suspension on the front wheels.  A far better arrangement for the 3-point hitch and better steering with a tighter lock and 'hand of god' available as well as the in-cab wheel.

All round this is a great example of technic construction with some creative building techniques.  And it makes a model that is great for display, but also fantastic for playing with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
