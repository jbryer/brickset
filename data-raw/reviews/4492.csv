I suppose the pieces in this set are pretty generic (apart from maybe the pre-printed slope and the grey fence, and you can pick them up quite easily).  Still, a nice addition to any space collection.

I love the design and simplicity of some of the older sets. Just a handfull of bricks and there you are - and all the bricks were so good to build alternate models or mix them up with the other bricks you have. Just simple and amazing. This set is one of the very first space sets lego produced, and it still has anything you need for playing - a figure, a small shuttle but there is no weapon (or something you could pretend to be a weapon except the antenna to hit on some other spacemans head) - let there be peace in the universe, no war ;)

5/5 for playability, creative design and nostalgia :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>This can only be described as a boring looking pocket money starter set. Younger children would probably enjoy it for it is very swooshable and solid built, but has little to inspire for older children. With a few extra small parts the entire model would have been improved vastly, a seat for example. While the flash of blue is welcome on this dull set the engines just don&#39;t workout, feels like little thought went into this very early design. Granted it does look better with the minifig seated onboard, without. it is so under whelming, basic and forgettable when compared to similar type sets manufactured just a couple years later. Playability is limited as can only be expected with such a small set, there are no moving parts or functions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Great minifig, a classic that has stood the test of time and holds a special place in so many hearts.</li>
	<li>Very &quot;swooshable&quot;.</li>
	<li>Solidly built, only aerial knocks off easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>CON&#39;s</p>

<ul>
	<li>Too basic, needs seat, improved engines and possibly landing legs.</li>
	<li>Dull colour.</li>
	<li>No functions/moveable parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>For collectors a must, for everyone else, go for later model designs.</p>
