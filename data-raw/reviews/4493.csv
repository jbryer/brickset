"grepin","2007-02-14T14:21:58.25Z","Nice set =)","I was only introduced to Technic sets in the mid 90's, but I was always fascinated by most older sets, especially those from the late 80's and early 90's such as this one, so I began buying them recently.
This one is a very decent medium sized set with the basic functions, and I especially like the way it looks and its simple yet flawless mechanics. It's a must have!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sarin","2007-05-06T06:32:36.857Z","Nothing fancy, but a decent, good working design","While I was browsing on the net to look for sets to add to the collection, I stunted on the building instructions of this one by accident.

Though I wasn't directly charmed by the model (I have a thing with complex constructions), I figured I should be able to build it with the lego I already had.
So I did,  most of the parts I used came from the 8868 air-claw rig; the parts that should have been black I replaced with grey, and the yellow beams where replaced with black ones.

It may be a matter of taste..  but the model looks even better in black then in yellow.
Too bad the only feature of this model is the working piston engine (wich works flawless).
But both the jeep and the rally truck leave a lot of options for modification, for people who own a micromotor and/or a mindstorm-set this model can easily be converted to an RC-legocar.
Or you can extend the rear to add an extra axis, and give the model tracks instead of rear wheels, or....   or....   etc.

The relative simple design makes it an excellent starter kit for childeren, the frame can really take a punch or two; it survided more then one fall from the shelf, and the jeep stayed in one piece.
Add to that, that the set contains a fair amount of parts so it can be used as a source for extra parts as well. (for the peeps who don't have enough yellow parts already ;) )
The scale doesn't really match the size of the figures, (the wheels nearly reaches the guys' shoulder)..  but what the heck, i'm too old to actually play with the model anyway  :)
If it wheren't for sets like these, I would have abandoned lego long ago..  but this one kept me tweaking and modifying.
Maybe one day, when I have enough parts, I will use the basic design of this set to scale it up and make a MOC supercar of it.

The set itself is nothing fancy, but it's a good source of inspiration :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-20T11:48:27.153Z","Technic Jeep","This set is very cool. I like the jeep because it is so detailed from front to back. The other alternate set is good but not as good as the jeep. This set is pretty good overall and a must own for any Technic fan!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SuperCow","2008-08-19T19:53:58.217Z","Nice set","This was the first set with the new piston engine (or at least the first one I saw) I was directly stunned, and I wanted it. 
I must have been 9-10y. I was very much into engines, and duplicated the square pistons (2X2 plate with 2 * 1 beam with hole)
So the round pistons was a whole new world, and more realist. I remember buying a service pack with pistons to make it a V8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Bernd_the_Brick","2016-03-24T17:26:37.883Z","Difficult as child, but easy now","<p>This is one of my all time favourites. This was my first Technic-Set as I was nine&nbsp; or ten. As child this was one of the difficultest I ever build so far. Now I rebuilded it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No box anymore.</p>

<p>Very thin instruction booklet with more than a single part per step. <!--StartFragment-->As child very complex. But now, with experience it&#39;s very easy. I couldn&#39;t remember that the engine was build so late in the complete model.<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some few Technic gears and old beams with studs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is one of the few sets with a Technic figure. I love it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As child it feeled like hours, now within an hour. Cool old school technic building.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A small, but cool jeep.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A must have for every classic Technic fan. It is worth for a remake</p>
