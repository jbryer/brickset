As some others wrote, the pneumatic parts are not strong enough, for that reason I updatet them to the newer version. The only problem is to get with all the tubes to the cylinders (because the new ones need 2 tubes each), but I managed it quite good. I inserted a pair of fixed tube-parts (like in 8868)to ease it.

<p>(This is my third review on excavators from the list.)</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This has been the first excavator in the <strong>Technic</strong> line. At that time first pneumatic setup was introduced with this model. (Second set was universal building set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8040-1"" title=""8040"">8040</a>.) Beside the new technic elements a mono-functional part, the digging bucket has been used for the first time in a technic set.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>The size of the built model is is comparable to 8294 set.</p>

<p>Similar to new sets the undercarriage has not much in it. Using studded beams, it is very rigid and stable albeit using fewer parts than recent models.</p>

<p>The superstructure also is squarish. It appears to be designed to host the pneumatic elements only. The drivers cabin is just an empty space: There isn&#39;t even a floor to it.<br />
The pneumatic switches are well alinged and acessible even for bigger hands/fingers. This is something that I am missing in recent sets.</p>

<p>The arm appears to be constructed of the minimum required amount of parts to allow for the pneumatic functions. The bend in the lowest part has been cleverly done in a bottom-to-bottom set up of studded beams.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>There are three pneumatic cylinders that raise/lower respectively bend the arm and operate the shovel.<br />
The first pneumatic cylinders have only one port where either overpressure or vacuum has to be applied. This is achieved by means of a pump in combination with the <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/4692c01"" title=""Pneumatic distribution block"">Pneumatic Distribution Block</a> (basically a pair of<br />
one-way valves).<br />
Due to this basically only one cylinder can be operated at a time.</p>

<p>Besides that, superstructure can be rotated freely on the turntable and the model can be pushed on its tracks.</p>

<p>As already has been written in previous reviews the threaded axle does not add much stability to the connection of superstructure and undercarriage as the nuts tend to become loose.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>When the model was released in 1985 I was entering my <em>dark ages</em>. I acquired it some 25 years later only. However I regard it -still- as well designed set. It has only about half the number of parts compared to todays models of similar size.</p>

<p>Also, the colour scheme of black, red and grey - now and then - is a great alteration from the typical yellow construction vehicles.</p>

"Crazy_Chris","2012-08-20T16:11:29.857Z","Early Pneumatic flagship set","<b>My personal story:</b><br>Although released in 1984, it took about 5 years until I got this set. In 1989, the exvacator has already been dropped from the official line-up. Therefore, one of our local toy stores wanted to get rid of that old stuff, and offered 8851 for half of it's former price. So, my dad had no problems to find my 1989 birthday present. I still own it today, the original box looks fine, and the bricks were never mixed with other sets.<br><br><b>Pneumatic system:</b><br>Of course, the pneumatic parts are the ones that we are interested in. Besides 8040, 8843 and 8680, the exvacator is the only 1st generation pneumatic set, that shows how to control more than one cylinder individually. The set contains:<br>1 pneumatic pump<br>3 pneumatic cylinders<br>3 pneumatic switches<br>1 pneumatic distribution block<br>4 pneumatic T pieces (8851 was the first set to contain this part)<br>and lots of pneumatic hoses...<br><br><b>Other parts of interest:</b><br>- obviously, the yellow digger bucket. Later on, it should appear only once again in set 8862<br>- lots of wide technic chain parts. Already known from set 856, sets containing these parts seem to appear only 1-2 times each decade<br>- threaded axles and axle nuts, again parts that were introduced by set 8851<br><br><b>Building the set:</b><br>Building the set is quite challenging. The design of the frame is rather simple and straight-forward. But the pneumatic parts - end especially the hoses - need attention. But if you work carefully, everything will fit perfect into it's assigned position.<br><br><b>Looks:</b><br>The color scheme is not very exciting: gray-red-black. But back in the 80ies, gray technic bricks were always welcome. Overall, the exvacator looks somewhat blocky. But on the others hand, it looks like a real exvacator, too.<br><br><b>Playability:</b><br>One word: great. The exvacator arm works perfect. The chassis overrides lots of obstacles. All in all, 8851 will turn every table into a construction arena.<br><br><b>Need more ?</b><br>Have a look at set 856. This old yellow bulldozer is the perfect partner for 8851.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"fhansson","2011-10-12T11:43:31.697Z","Great set of early pneumatics!","<p>This is probably the one Lego set I played with most of all. I remember it beeing quite difficult to build with very tiny fittings for the pneumatics. I only built it once because I didn't want to destroy anything once it was finished. The pneumatics was very cool but the first generation had some flaws in operating. It was more open or close rather than precisious digging. However, the attitude and cool look of the excavator made up for it. Very fun!</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
"martiniman","2013-09-20T08:44:51.783Z","Still de best looking Technic excavator and my introduction to pneumatics","<p>Got this as a kid, my introduction to Lego Pneumatics. Until I got the Unimog, I had no idea later Pneumatics is so much better.
</p>
<h4>Aesthetics<br></h4><p>This is one of the best looking Technic sets ever. It looks like a real excavator, it is simplified in a very nice way, the colour scheme is perfect and because it has the original pneumatics, the cylinders look really good on the bucket arm. I think it is the best looking excavator and even surpasses the holy 8043 on looks. It has perfect Technic looks, yet it looks like the real thing too.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>No special parts. The only special thing is the threaded axle with nuts. No idea why Lego went with this, as it does not do what it has to do (holding the upper and lower part tight). Only the bucket is an awesome special piece, and beating every modern ""flexible"" black bucket.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>If you compare it to the more modern sets the build is straightforward and fast. It has the piece number of a modern small set, back then it was a big set. The small air tubes are a little hard to put into the red base.</p><p>I upgraded the pneumatics with the modern cylinders from the Unimog, and it is relatively easy. This makes the model a lot stronger. The only tricky part of the upgrade is that you should use modern pieces to guide the tubes on the arm. The 2x1 beam with 2 holes is perfect to do this, but it is a brick unavailable back in the day.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks fantastic and it is fun to play. Motorized it is a bit odd looking around the cabin, but with the modern pneumatics and a small compressor cylinder you can fit all into the back easily. The only thing is that you should use it with a remote wired battery container, as that part does not fit on the back.</p><p>Playability is great, the arm operates nicely, and with the newer cylinders it becomes strong enough (the original ones are weak). The threaded axle that holds the tracks and the red base together gets loose all the time when turning the upper part. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Great classic with awesome Technic looks, good playability and great building. Easy to upgrade with modern pneumatics or modern turntable.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
"DrLex","2016-04-17T17:24:08.65Z","The start of pneumatics for both LEGO and me","<p>This was the flagship set for the first generation of pneumatics, featuring 3 cylinders, controlled by 3 switches and the rare pneumatic distribution block.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was great, of the classic type with a lid that could be opened to&nbsp;showcase&nbsp;the new pneumatic parts. That was one surefire way of making kids nag the ears off their parents. I can&#39;t remember whether that&#39;s what&nbsp;I did, but I got the box as a Christmas present nevertheless.</p>

<p>The instructions booklet explained how to use the pneumatics. At that time I didn&#39;t grasp how the distribution block worked, because the booklet made it seem as if it&nbsp;magically converts pressure into vacuum. Later on it became obvious that it merely consists of two check valves that provide a path for air going either from the center to the right port, or from the left to the center port.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains the rare excavator bucket, only featured in one later set (8862). It also introduced the threaded technic axle, although it did not really work as intended&nbsp;unless 1/2 bushes&nbsp;were added to prevent the nuts from rotating. The caterpillar tracks were built from 110 rather fragile&nbsp;small links. The spares provided couldn&#39;t prevent that eventually I had too few of them to build the entire model. Luckily&nbsp;today there is Bricks&amp;Pieces and the part is still in production&nbsp;(part number&nbsp;3873), so I could finally restore this model in all its glory.</p>

<p>Obviously, the most important parts are the pneumatics. These&nbsp;first generation parts&nbsp;relied on a single hose per cylinder. The pump provided both pressure and vacuum, and the magical distribution block allowed to switch between those.&nbsp;This system had two main&nbsp;problems: <em>first,</em>&nbsp;vacuum force was limited by atmospheric pressure, which is why it was often easier to move the digger arm up than down. <em>Second,</em> airflow was pretty much unrestricted, causing the cylinders to shoot between one extreme position to another. The second-generation pneumatics fixed both issues, by adding a second hose to rely on pressure only, and by constricting the cylinder inlets, resulting in smoother action that more closely resembles hydraulics.</p>

<p>As a kid I experimented with putting <em>water</em> in the pneumatic system, which proved a bad idea because the water&nbsp;washed away the silicone grease inside the parts. This resulted in the pistons becoming stiff, and the distribution block failing to work on air. Only recently I managed to restore all parts back to normal by injecting viscous silicone oil.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I remember building this as a kid&nbsp;without any assistance, and spending quite a long time on it. Recently I rebuilt it, and I must say it still is a bit of a challenge. Although I feel present-day instruction booklets are too &lsquo;verbose&rsquo; at times, the instructions from back then were often very succinct. On the upside, this increases satisfaction when the model is finally ready.</p>

<p>The most difficult part is routing the hoses, care must be taken to avoid kinks. The construction also has two rubber bands to assist the pneumatic system, and getting these in place is tricky as well, especially because they are near the hoses.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>To today&#39;s standards, the model is crude of course, but I do like the studded look characteristic of early Technic sets. In the end, it does look like a real excavator and that&#39;s what matters. As with many pneumatic sets, the pump is disguised as an exhaust pipe. The color scheme is OK with black for the undercarriage, red for the body, gray for the arm and cabin, and yellow for the pneumatics and bucket.</p>

<p>As explained in the instruction manual, it is advisable to nudge the cylinders before playing with the model if unused for a while, otherwise the cylinders tend to suffer even more from the jerky movement problem.&nbsp;Due to the limitations of the first-gen pneumatics, controlling the arm requires special care if one wants to pick up something without catapulting it across the room.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The biggest appeal for me as a kid were the then new pneumatics, which offered many new opportunities for&nbsp;MOCs. The immature first-gen system limited&nbsp;playability, but as a first introduction it was more than enough to spark the imagination.&nbsp;The fact that this set introduced this new concept&nbsp;is why it will always keep a special place in my heart despite its limitations.</p>
