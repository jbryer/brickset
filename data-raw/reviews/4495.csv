The construction/design of the transform-mechanics in this model is quite interesting, it kept me entertained for long times when I built and played with it, and I learned a lot. It is a great starter set, and I believe you even can install an early-type lego engine in it. (which I did later). I do not remember having any problems with the model, but I do remember being a bit scared by the looks of it in the night (creepy eyes) :) ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This was one of the two earliest Technic sets I owned (the other was 8842), and was by far my favourite. I would build it and rebuild it over and over again, and I liked the alternative model, a buggy, just as much. There are so many beam parts for make-your-own vehicle designs, too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
