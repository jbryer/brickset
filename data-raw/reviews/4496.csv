"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-24T10:51:15Z","Great.","I remember this as being my first serious Technic set. I loved it, it even had two different functions! And it had back steering. The only flaw is that the connecting things tend to break off. Other than that, it's a really good set.

For some reason, I really liked the (less complicated, and with just one function) alternate model very much. I have built both models lots of times. And I liked the wheels :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It can easily be rebuilt for other tasks such as fork lift or snow plow. A fun, simple and affordable set of classic Technic Lego!</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5
