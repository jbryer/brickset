&nbsp;<br />
It sported a brilliant red and yellow colour combination with highlights of grey and black which seems to be less popular in the early 21st Century, which is unfortunate.&nbsp; Being a scale model of a working mobile crane, the functions packed into this chassis were impressive indeed.&nbsp; These included stabilisers, steering, and a sturdy telescopic jib that could be raised, lowered and pivoted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Almost all functions in this set were operated by cogs or corkscrew gears, manipulated by large, round handles.&nbsp; These days, such contrivances may look a little anachronistic, but on this set, twenty years or more later, they still look fine.&nbsp; The main attraction of this set is the jib, which can be raised and lowered via the plastic and metal pneumatic tubes.&nbsp; Not much to add to the already obvious, other than that such simple actions are governed by a fairly complex pumping mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most delightful surprises of this model is that the telescopic jib is really telescopic, not just some sort of cheap gimmick that justifies TLG's fairly large price tag.&nbsp; When at rest, the arm of the jib measures 26 cms (10 inches), but when extended, a whopping 40 cms (15.75 inches) is unleashed!</p>
<p>Like every other Technic model, this set is not perfect, though it's pretty darn close.&nbsp; The black twine that simulates the chain does tend to catch when being lowered, despite the heavy hook on the end.&nbsp; And due to the placement of the pneumatic hose on the pump, the jib does not rotate 360&ordm;.&nbsp; Finally, back in 1989 when I bought the model, it cost me AU$89.00, which was a good deal of money back then, and is still significant now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These, however, are minor quibbles for such a cleverly designed, compact mobile crane with as many features as this one has.&nbsp; Over the years, many more cranes have been sold by TLG, but nothing as neat and tidy as this model.&nbsp; If you spot one on eBay, think about purchasing it.&nbsp; You shouldn't be disappointed.<br />

Very smooth and very strong in lift force. The crane mobile is rather complicated but not hard to build. The crane works good and all in all it's a nice mix of complicity and playability. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my favourite was never the crane. It was the dump truck! What an awesome looking vehicle! It's probably the only Lego set I have spent more time with the second model than the first. It's not hard to build but it is superiour in operating and modification. Together with the excavator and front loader the dump truck fits perfect. All in all it's&nbsp;a great combination of vehicles in this set. The red colour is also cooler than yellow. :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
