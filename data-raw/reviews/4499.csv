You gotta love the rotorblade system! moving up and down and left and right an again...
I didnt really like the secundary model, much to transparent! but then again, nowadays all the technic stuff is transparent...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T21:22:28Z","Nice model with compact features","I got this model when I was 10, it was a bit non-challenging to me at the time, and I was never interested in the secondary model. This is one of the few models that is still in one piece (mostly because I never built the other model). Whats interesting about this model is the rotorblade system and the number of features in a compact volume. I guess it is a bit complex for the technic newbie but it is probably a great second or third set! I think it can be equipped with a LEGO electric engine.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"grepin","2008-10-26T20:18:25.797Z","The best Technic helicopter so far","The list of functions is quite large: retractable landing gear, tilting main rotor, both rotors spin simultaneously, and it even has a small crane - a total of 4 pulleys plus the joystick to control all these features.
I've owned a pair of 8412's for several years, and always considered it a great set, despite the fragile flex cables - I hope the cables in this one hold better (the fact I'm older should help a lot, eheh).

As for the secondary model, although I don't see myself disassembling the helicopter to build it, it does look quite interesting, because it's the only LEGO hovercraft I know of with a tilting propeller.

To sum up, this set has a great set of features, is challenging enough to build, provides many spare parts, and just looks awesome once built because it's fairly large but compact. Also, being able to easily motorize it with a 8720 is a great bonus. So, this set is definitively a must-have ;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sarin","2007-02-26T10:11:44.03Z","Completely awesome","This set is one of my all-time favourites, I bought this one in '95..  a time i was a total fan of airplanes and helicopters.
It was a bit difficult to build I recall, I didn't have much experience in building complex technic sets at that time.
But after an hour or 4, I managed to complete the model, and it stood for about 6 years before i took it apart (I never built the 2nd model).
The flex system on this model still stands for one of the most elegant constructions of LEGO technic, and is underutilized by lego.

Through the years, some of the fragile flex-cables broke and the model was crippled.
Be&#239;ng unable to replace the broken parts, I only built the model once more 
because it certainly is a fun challenging set to build, and it looks awesome.
I hope that one day I will be able to replace the broken parts, and restore the model in it's full glory.

If it weren't for the fragile cables, I would have awarded it with the maximum score.
My final verdict: 4 ot of 5
