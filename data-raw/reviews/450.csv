The design is pretty basic and couldn't really be improved on, but I would recommend putting a flat plate with a number on it like many racecars have.  Real suspension might be asking too much but it wouldn't hurt.  I own it but can't say it's a must-have set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

There really isn't much to say, I mean its a red race car with a touch of yellow and black, which looks nice, a racing frame and a spoiler on a hinge so you can choose the best angle. Also the spoiler is made from grill pieces.

Overall it's a nice little cheapy. An average 5/10. Don't go out of your way for it like 1631 but if you come across it, it makes a nice addition for any collector or player looking for more vehicles for their figs.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>It is indeed a solid little design, about the only thing I'd have differently is put a number plate for designation on it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
