It has front and rear lights, a very well inserted spoiler and a big blue seat. The engine has full working chain of transmission, that however makes some problems while the wheels are moving (the chain may don't rotate very smoothly).
The dragster was nearly as cool as the chopper. It is very long and thin, but not poor of particulars, like the pilot seat and steering wheel. The powerfull engine and the big spoiler make the rear very special, and the big wheels are perfect for the proportions of the car. 
In my opinion it's one of the best sets of the high quality Technic of that time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The enginepart of the trike is big and wild and loud. It has more than enough details to give it tha ""real""look. Working four-cylinder engine and drive-chain.
(but truly what does this chain drive?)

The steering half and single-demped suspension of the trike looks fragile but is quite sturdy.

The footsteps are a nice detail!
