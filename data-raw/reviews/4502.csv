What a cool set.  I thought the 8858 was a catalog misprint, since by the time I got into Lego Technic sets, no one I knew had it, and it could not be found in stores anywhere.  

Dad brought it back from the States in 1983.  I believe he said the kit was found covered in dust forgotten in a toy store stockroom (along with a lonely 857), and was the last one they had.  I feel lucky just to have the grey-faucet version!

Anyway, the pictures on the box and the instruction manual tell the 8858’s story best – build the engine, turn the crank, watch it work.  Over the years, my 8860 has been the recipient of a version of the 8858’s flat-six engine, and an adaptation of the V-6 went into my 853 and 8865 kits.  Even my 8859 harvester got a big dose of 8858 once – I put the inline-3 in it, and it worked, but it looked really funny.  

The 8858 is a small set, but sometimes that’s all you need.  Hook it up to the 870 motor kit and you’ll never get any homework done.  10/10, 25 April 2004

I learned that my mother had disposed of them, which means they probably went to the local thrift store.  Somewhere out there is a LegoHead playing with my bricks.  Lucky B@&*@%).

But there was one set left in the closet, this one, my very last one.  It is a funny little set; it has a small part count but the models it makes are complex (well at least they were when I was little).  I remember that it took a good deal more concentration to build these models than it did the other, garden-variety Lego sets.  Compared to Technic sets these days, one appreciates the very modest use of Technic elements.  For example, because the cylinder heads are square, the entire engine block could be made from regular bricks.  

I would like to see Lego do this type of thing again, not necessarily auto engines, but working machinery of some sort.  Technic does not always have to be a vehicle.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
