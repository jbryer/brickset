Amazed by the new technic parts, (engine with pistons and front suspension assembly)  I found my old stash of legos and spent the next few days building a 1994 Nissan Pathfinder replica.  It looked great with working steering wheel and engine.  I used the garage door from my police station for the sun roof.  I even got the spare tire on the back to control the steering of the front wheels.  I still have it built and on display today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Really like how many features lego put into this set-

Suspension all round (damped front suspension)
Working steering (through roof)
Working winch with ratchet to stop load dropping
Rear diff
Nice big wheels
V6 Engine

I particularly like the front suspension, as well as being double wishbone, a shock absorber is placed crossways between the suspension units, thus acting as a damper.

The rear is done in the same way as a motorbike wth a swinging arm.

A very nice set with a lot of useful parts for your own creations.

The ATV is also a nice model and I really like the lights on the ATV! This set is flawless in everyway and is a must own for Technic fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
