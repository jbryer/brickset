"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-17T02:50:21Z","Essential boxed set for classic space collectors","I'm a proud owner of a BOXED set of one of these!  This has to be one of the smallest lego sets imaginable, and yet there are THREE designs on the back of the box! 

One of the things I always loved about this classic set is it's so easy for even a child to build it from memory.  

Love those classic space guns too! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cornwell","2008-05-03T18:12:05.827Z","Simple, small, fun","This is one of those classic little kits that merely exists, and anyone who owned any Space-LEGO back in that day and age owned it, simply because it was simple, small and cheap as dirt. This is one of the kits even a five year old could buy out of his own pocket, and be happy with it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>Elle est simple à monter, très peu de pièces, et c'est parti pour des heures de jeu avec ce véhicule qui peut aller explorer n'importe quelle planète !</p>

"CamberbrickGreen","2009-11-27T13:44:45.623Z","Near Perfect Simplicity","I believe that the smaller original space models were the best with cool ray guns and little bits of equipment that the spacemen dash around in. Plenty of easy build fun here, usually with just several very fine Classic Space bricks.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>The classic white space astronaut.</li></ul></div><div>White Spaceman: a true original.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Lunar Rock N' Roll</b></div><div>The vehicle here is of course moon rock grey and the ray gun is a green muzzle 'flashing' blaster of some sort. The tiny interplanetary car also sports a set of oxygen or fuel tanks.<br><br>This brilliant little moon buggy may not have endless alternate build possibilities but is a neat ride and staple of the original space theme. As other reviewers mention, everyone usually had one but much later you may find the smaller sets are not often as attractive? Personally I thought them definitely better than the large sets.<br><br>These spacemen mainly explore and research as Blacktron did not come until later, still I suppose they were armed to the teeth just incase. White spaceman is my favourite, which was yours?</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"BigFairy","2011-02-01T23:06:53.94Z","Simple but effective!","<p>As the title suggests, its simple but effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A buggy of this size is always welcome in any space set, and including the low cost, was an excellent introduction into the classic space theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got one of these of ebay as i just had to have it as part of my 'classic' space collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Ernst","2011-07-29T18:49:34.76Z","Small car, big result","<p>Such a great result with just 20 small parts to built something. After 2 minutes of building you really&nbsp;have a <strong>real</strong> space buggy, amazing !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just 3 bricks here, it all fits perfectly but in just 2 minutes it's finished. You can hardly call it an experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts deserve 4 bricks, thanks to the completeness. All is present including a good space weapon. Grey is the perfect choice of color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perfect playability, either with the single buggy or combined with other space sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money 5 bricks, you can find it starting from € 2,00 according to Bricklink. So in reach for every Lego fan, and it is definitly worth it !!</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T17:32:54.66Z","Possibly the easiest set of all to build","<p>There aren&#39;t many parts to this set, and therefore it&#39;s likely to be the easiest set ever to build. You probably won&#39;t need to look at the instructions, it&#39;s clear from the photograph what goes where.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this, it&#39;s a fun little set, and would have suited a young child as their first minifigure set, especially as at the time, the simplicity was reflected in the price. And it could easily be reconfigured, especially if a few extra parts were close to hand. It probably looks very simplistic now, but on its release, no collection could be called complete without it.&nbsp;</p>
