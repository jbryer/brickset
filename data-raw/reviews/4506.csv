"A_Brickset_user","2001-01-31T00:00:00Z","","The first decent technic car chassis. A rear mounted flat four cylinder engine drives the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox. Nice steering and adjustable seats, only the read wheels have suspension, however. Because this set was around before the customised parts really starting appearing, you could probably build it quite easily from a good selection of other sets. Overall, a very good early set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2001-08-23T00:00:00Z","","I was never into technic in a big way, but back in the 80's this just left me awestruck every time I walked into the shop that sold it. It comes in a nice box box and is definitely somewhere in my favourite top 5 technic sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2002-04-19T00:00:00Z","","My goal is to collect all 5 ""Super Car"" sets that Lego has produced.  I had #956 and #8448 before I found this set on eBay.  It looked OK, but since I've built it, I've gained a new appreciation for it!  It was fun to build, fun to play with and was VERY easily motorized with the new 9V mini-motor.  I used an 8 tooth gear on the motor to a 24 tooth gear on the car's engine and only 6 other pieces to mount the motor. With this set-up, you get nice 3-speed action and no slippage or foul-ups.  What a great set!  Now, all I need is #8880 and #8865 to complete my collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-01-24T00:00:00Z","","Why doesn't LEGO produce sets like this anymore? The techniques are quite simple, but you can use all parts for you MOCs! I have four of them, but I will buy a 5th copy when I see one at a reasonable price! One of my all time favorites!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-01-30T00:00:00Z","","Has my vote for the best Lego box ever; that box MAKES you want to buy it. When I was a little boy I drooled over this model in Lego catalogs.
Instructions make it easy to completely motorize the model (steering + transmission). The dragster alternate model is disappointing. For the best dragster, see the 8457 alternate model, which easily outshines the main model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-03-20T00:00:00Z","","This set was fantastic in it's day, but has now been superceded by the 2 Super Car kits. I never really owned it but my friend did, so I used to regularly visit him for my building fix. Once we tried to make a body for the chassis, but rapidly ran out of bricks and couldn't get the scale right. The thing ended up looking like a Land Rover with tiny seats!
The 3 speed gearbox was a bit tricky to operate and the square engine pistons tended to jam in the cylinders and separate from the conn. rods, but all I have are good memories of this kit.
When I was a few years older my mother found a second hand version of this kit and gave it to my nephew. Unfortunately the kit was incomplete so we had to convert the car into a 3 wheeled version!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

But now, after 20 years finally have got one copy. I've built it with deep sighs and I hold it of course in high respect. I hope so the LEGO someday will return to the origins. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-18T11:12:57Z","Superb","Had this set when it was new and am trying to buy a replacement for the one I sold with all my technic for forty pounds as a teenager. I rember the diff cogs used to pop off and the engine and gearbox used to separate from the rest of the car. I too tried (and failed) to build a body, my freind Chris had this set as well and we used to crash then down the stair so we could rebuild them and tried to build in extra strength, I also upgrade the motor to a six cylinder with Chris's model when he left it at my house !",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T19:08:54Z","Ah, the memories","This was my introduction to Lego Technic and I absolutely loved it. Many a moon base and space ship followed after. It's a great set, very educational, with working cylinders and crankshaft, three speed gearbox, steering, shock absorbers, the works. It even has adjustable seats!

I must have had a slightly different model though, because I see on the photo that it has regular axles with springs as shock absorbers, while my version has real spring-loaded one piece shock absorbers...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T19:57:10Z","Monster Car","The size of this car when finished just floored me.  This was the last technic set I ever bought.  I was getting old then.  Great set, although the image showed an old style shock system the set came with the updated shocks.  Plus the set also had a 'differential' for the drive axle.  Sweet!  4 big wheels, I was in heaven. :)  Takes a while to make but end result is well worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:10:53Z","Truest technic essence","
The 8860 improved on the wonderful 853 (a differential! shock absorbers! 3-speed transmission!), and has satisfyingly stout construction. Over the years I have whiled away many good hours of building with this set.

I bought my 8860 while visiting Legoland in Denmark in 1981. My parents told me to wait until we returned home to build the kit. By the time we got home, I had managed to surreptitiously build the 8860's seats without losing any parts or getting caught. 

About 20 years ago, I spent a day building a car body for my 8860 out of non-technic pieces, and the housecat pulled it off the table about five minutes after I finished it. Pieces went everywhere, but none of them were broken. I have since forgiven the cat.

"Time4TT","2008-12-22T01:57:08.763Z","The second car chassis","A marvelous improvement on the original Lego car chassis (853). This model fixed all the problem with the original (it didn't sag under it's own weight, included a differential gear and worked well in all it's gears).

This model shifted the engine to the rear - VW Bug fashion - and included suspension on the rear. It didn't quite work here as the wheels angled up &amp; in (instead of just going up), but overall a big improvement on the original model (which had fake suspension legs which didn't do much except fall off).

The only other problem I remember is the seats would tend to fall flat when used as the ratchet gear got a little loose. However, a great evolution from the original.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Also, if you have enough pieces, you can make the exterior of the car which would look awesome. The engine is very detailed too.

I still have this model boxed with instructions etc and it must have been disassembled for nearly twenty years!

When it was fully constructed I modded it the infinate degree.  I installed a backseat, a third gear, reverse gear, twin carburetors, modified the steering, seats, fitted a centre console and even...wait for it...carpets.

The ultimate aim was to create a ""rolling"" road to test the models endurance on but I never quite got there before other hobbies, and girls, came along.
