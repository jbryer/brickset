I built both models several times and I believe the two models in the set is quite equivalent, with the excavator being slightly more interesting to build. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"grepin","2007-02-14T14:28:26.263Z","One of the top LEGO pneumatic sets","I was amazed when I finished building this one just a few months ago after buying it online. The number of functions and its look are simply great :D

Of course there are better looking and more complex similar sets around, but taking into account the age of this set, I'd say it's one of those special sets that every LEGO collector should have - I'm glad I bought it :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"quorneng","2007-02-18T13:47:59.25Z","A classic Lego pneumatic set","This set makes up a nice looking model that is strong enough to be really played with. It has a mixture of pneumatic and pneumatic systems to work all the various features. The worm drive &quot;over-centre&quot; linkage for the stabilser legs is particularly neat.
Like most of the original stud construction Technic sets is is quite easy to modify, mine ended up with a rocking beam front axle for true off road mobility and even pneumatics in place of the mechanical linkage for operating the front bucket. Well worth buying.
Of course the much later 8455 Back Hoe has pneumatic everything but it was (and still is) much more expensive and not as strong.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"masacra","2009-09-09T18:21:26.81Z","a really great set","I got this one as a used set. The packaging was great, but more important it was such great fun to build it! I really enjoyed it. And it has a lot of gears and functionality. For me it is a classic Technic set, which is very solid. There is no engine, but the functionality of this set is outstanding. Four different functions plus three pneumatic ones. I just wish Lego would make more sets like this one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DrFrankenstein","2012-10-20T00:54:51.03Z","A great classic with some flaws","<p>This was Technic's first large-scale backhoe model. The designer did an excellent job of combining mechanical and pneumatic functions. It was a great first attempt, but ultimately not without flaws. The outrigger bases and the bevel gears keep popping off and front bucket structure is weak.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent use of pneumatics</li><li>Lots of functions<br></li><li>Large scale</li><li>Innovative model</li><li>Solid rear liftarm<br></li><li>Great alternative model</li><li>High nostalgia factor<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The outrigger bases keep falling off</li><li>The front bucket support structure is weak</li><li>The bevel gears keep pooping out even at minimal stress<br></li></ul>
<p>This set is one of the greatest classic Technic sets of the late 80s, which holds a special place in the hearts of many Technic fans. It's a great backhoe, but if I had to choose, I'd go with the 8455 model that followed in 2003 which is better in almost all aspects - aesthetics, complexity, pneumatics.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"fhansson","2011-10-13T05:25:16.677Z","King of pneumatics!","The backhoe grader is the biggest and most advanced pneumatic model of the 80's. It was like Lego really wanted to show what could be done with pneumatics.&nbsp;The downside of this model is that it is oversized and overpriced. The price tag was much higher than other sets this year and the scale does not fit into other models such as the power crane or dump truck. Older models tends to look much smaller compared to this beast. It's not that complicated to build as you might think but the many hosings of pneumatics is a bit tricky to get into place. It's a rock solid digger and the second generation of pneumatics works perfect. The front&nbsp;scope is a bit weak and does not&nbsp;impress as much as the back digger. The second model is also nice looking and fun to play with. Yellow is not my favourite colour theme but it works for this model. It's not my favourite because it's too big and clumsy next to other Lego sets. The high price tag is also not really motivated for what you got in the package.",FALSE,4,5,4,4,3
"Crazy_Chris","2013-11-19T06:14:21.703Z","Too much yellow","<p>This one is the 1989 technic flagship set. It contains lots of pneumatic parts, and the yellow buckets that also came with sets 8851 and 8853.</p>
<p>Although the set containts nearly 700 parts, the build is rather simple and very straightforward. But lots of pneumatic tubes need to be handled, especially building the exvacator arm is a little bit challenging. This is the only disadavantage of the gen#2 pneumatic system - each working cylinder needs 2 tubes instead of 1.</p>
<p>The playbability of the model is great - there are many&nbsp;features and the mechanics work great and smooth. But in general, the model lacks color, it's just too much yellow. A black (or gray) base frame would have been a good idea.</p>
<p>All in all, not a bad flagship set. Moreover, the building instructions offer a very nice B-model.</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,5,4
"technicAlex","2012-12-09T12:27:43.44Z","Great JCB","<p>This is a great set that I got for xmas when I was 6. I've rebuilt it many times and the combine, which just isn't as satisfying and it's totally enjoyable. I'm fairly sure&nbsp;I got this before the first control centre but I'm not sure, the control centre was never a patch on the JCB.</p><p>This&nbsp; time I've built the JCB with an extra piston at the bottom of the rear arm, and am adding an air reservoir behind the valves in the cab.</p><p>It's&nbsp; a shame the front bucket system isn't very tough but a&nbsp;bit pof blu tack in the rod connections goes a long way.</p><p>it has to be said that the scale of the model, the buckets and the wheels are all very good, it just looks right, even the pump as an exhaust pipe works very well.</p><p>I've just built 8455 JCB, the scale's all wrong, the front bucket too big, the rear bucket too small, and it just should have been bigger overall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Update 13.12.2012 - Air tank added, I've also reduced the length of the bricks and axles that hold the front bucket by two studs to put the front bucket in a more realistic position.</p><p><a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/541/dsc03746y.jpg/"">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/541/dsc03746y.jpg/</a><br><a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/825/dsc03703z.jpg/"">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/825/dsc03703z.jpg/</a><br><a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/812/dsc03699m.jpg/"">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/812/dsc03699m.jpg/</a><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
