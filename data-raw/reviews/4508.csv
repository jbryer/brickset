Took me a couple nights to build as I was so fixated on it. The suspension and engine in this model really set a love for mechanical things in motion.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T20:49:12Z","This was also my first car. ","This was every boys dream when it came out - the premier lego model - and I was so happy when I got it for Christmas present. At the time I was seven years old and it took me probably about 12-16 hours to finish, but since I enjoyed it so much I stayed up long in the night to do it. (probably the first time in my life I worked late, but certainly not the last ;) It is a good set, and I can really recommend it to anyone interested! I built both models a few times, but I enjoyed the standard car the most. I had some problems with the geerswitch-knob and lamp-raiser-knob coming of. And the seats where a bit loose, however those where minor issues and probably due to lots of playing around. In the end, while I was having lots if fun with this model, I rate the 8880 higher, since it feels better designed and more &quot;modern&quot;.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:27:46Z","Lego's Pontiac Fiero","The only weird thing about the 8865 is its color scheme (best summed up in three words: Too Many Colors). I don't have a clue as to what color combination would look better with such an abundance of those cool grey beams (I also have no alternate color scheme suggestion -- understand that this opinion is coming from a guy with zero fashion sense).  I also don't like the proliferation of those annoying black connector pins (which are hard to remove).

Despite the colors, the 8865 is another top-notch Lego big car kit. It is a lot like the 8860, but just a bit more clever. The independent suspension is a sheer delight, and the pop-up lights are a nice touch (remove the black barrels and put the 970 light blocks in for some night-owl action). Slightly bigger (wider and taller) wheels would have worked well with this set, but the supplied 24x43s do the job. A slick 3-speed transmission is teamed up with a supergood big-pistoned V-4. There is actually enough room to fit an old school V-6 back there (I used a variation on the one from the old 8858 engine builder set).

The 8865 offers just as much fun as the 8860 VW Karmann Ghia/Beetle/Porsche 912 car chassis. Deduct a half-point for the color thing and the ho-hum box/packaging (where are the plastic trays!).

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-03T14:56:52Z","Joy(all)Ride","This is a model that gives you lots of hours of building fun! 
The motor is great an gives you a bit more understanding about car engines. The suspencion is also very nice, 2 springs(?)at every wheel!

The problem of easy moving seats can be solved by tightening both sides of the chair gear.
It is also a 'see through' car. It can easily be modified by putting some extra beams and extra plates in, now you got a great ride!

The gears are great, it really works, in low gear(1) your motor really spins about. But in High gear (3)it purs.

Only bad thing is the turning radius, on a car like this it should be smal. But the wheels connect with the rest of the car at simple turns!!

Besides this easily fixable point, buy it when (if) you find it!!!!!!
I just got mine of the internet at a reasonable price, (about $67.00 including shipping)with instructions. But I'vve seen other prices.

"A_Brickset_user","2007-02-25T19:07:23.263Z","The first  &quot;big&quot; Lego car with proper suspension.","This set was a major advance over the previous 8860 car chassis, sporting double wishbone suspension all round, and its not just for show, it really works and its quite tough as well.
The V4 engine is an all 'built up' affair with standard Lego bricks and uses the older square pistons but nevertheless works well. Even the gear box uses standard Technic components.
The body work is pretty skimpy but strong enough that you don't have to worry about how best to pick up this quite a heavy model.
When you have finished the assembly you feel you have put together all the components of a real car, which is what Technic Lego is all about. I liked it so much I now have two.
A 'must' for any Lego enthusiast. It was good value when it came out nearly 20 years ago and it still is.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Time4TT","2008-12-22T02:04:07.997Z","3rd large Lego car","The next evolution after 8860. This model was more sporty looking and was the first to include the outline of the whole car. Lego still had the steering go through the steering wheel, which made play hard with the additional structure of the car outline.

The new &quot;Test Car&quot; fixed the problem of 8860 by having suspension which actually went up &amp; down, rather than up/in, down/out. Lego started work here on firming up the construction to make it much harder to break when dropped (I remember proudly showing people how it could be dropped from 2ft in the air without anything breaking!).

Pop up headlights were an additional charm. The engine was still in the rear to give enough space in the front for the steering mechanism and suspension. Seats were a little slap-dash and flimsy (and like the 8860 still fell flat when being used).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bambalero","2009-09-07T22:36:37.717Z","Nostalgic Big Lego Car","Hello everyone,

Please let me start from the beginning. 

It was 1988 and I just discovered the universal sets from Lego, by a present from my parents. On one of them, I discovered this model, the 8865, staring at me from the catalog pages.....

I told my parents I wanted this model but , sadly, at the time it was too expensive and my parents did not gave in to my constant pestering....

But, 21 years later, I was able to finally buy it through ebay, coming all the way from the UK. Happily the person I bought it from kept it in great condition, the pieces, instructions, box and all.

I started building it right after I received the package. I wondered at the great big wheels, all the gears I thought would be impossible to put together, and the photos on the box that promised all I longed for and more.....

After having it built, I discovered that nostalgia makes what you want bigger and better in your head than it really is. I have to say that I expected more challenge on building it, more functions and a more fun care that it turned out to be.

Yes, this is a great car, do not get me wrong. I just believe that there are some flaws on the design that let me down, like the - impossible to move unless you want it flat - seats, and the - so hard to make it go right - gearbox/motor.

On the good things, the pop up headlights are great, I have never seen this feature made better on any other lego model. The suspension is also noticeable, making the model go through any bumps in the road without losing stability.

I have the A model on display now, but I believe I'll try the B model and see if I like that better. Will update the review once I finish it.

Lego Fan - and you know it is you - go get it. Just don't let your hopes get too high as I did.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TechnicNick","2011-06-02T15:55:38.987Z","An Impressive But Slightly Odd Machine","Before I begin, let me make it clear that I regard this set as a good thing. The car (wherefore the appellation 'Test Car' ? I really don't know..) is an impressively complete assemblage of working features and detail felicities that, I am sure, beguiled many a budding engineer. So, three cheers for that.<div><br></div><div>However, this does not explain why the designers (who we can assume were colour-blind) saw fit to burden this otherwise fine machine with a track wide enough for a Hummer, an engine placement that, in a real car, would play havoc with the centre of gravity and such miserably anaemic seats. Maybe I'm in a bad mood because I've got sore fingers after taking one apart (those ****** pins!)</div><div><br></div><div>Let me, if you will, attempt to address these issues. The track measurement was dictated by the four link rear suspension design, so much more sophisticated than 8860's swinging axles. This meant using 2 universal joints on each side for the correct axle articulation - never mind that the same thing can be achieved with one UJ and pairs of gears tilting relative to each other (not very pure, I know, but needs must..). This would at least have taken some width out of it and not left it looking like a multicoloured monster truck with undernourished wheels.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the engine, this is a neat little unit but it's not that little. Blame those old square pistons (this was the last car to have them I think, and they are sorely missed). There's just no room for it except plonked as it is on top of the bulky rear suspension. If the car was a little longer, it may have fitted behind the seats, instantly creating a more exciting mid engine sports car.</div><div><br></div><div>And now the seats - we can only assume Lego ran out of budget within the price of this set to provide more than the simple hinged together and rather flimsy plates that they did. I suggest making a pair of 8860-like seats (so much more chunky looking and satisfying) - just not in blue...</div><div><br></div><div>Those ****** pins.... well, Lego themselves saw the error of their ways and changed the design shortly after this set was made. The black pins here, though, have what is known as an 'interference' fit inside their holes and this is why I have sore fingers (for the really obstinate ones, I use a 10 axle with a toggle on the end, pressed in the palm of my hand and PUSH. If that doesn't work, pass the chainsaw..). Better still, use some later black 'push-fit' pins and spare yourself the agony.</div><div><br></div><div>Now don't get me wrong, this set has many good points - the sophistication of it's suspension, the smooth operation of it's gearbox, the previously unheard-of structural integrity of it's chassis; not to mention those natty pop-up lights, my favourite thing about it. It just looks and feels like something designed by a committee who never met.</div>",TRUE,3,5,3,3,4
"manmaschine79","2011-06-04T16:15:47.74Z","Complex but beautiful","<p>This review might be written in 2011, but we're talking about something I built in 1990 when I was 11, it started though Christmas 1988 when I recieved it as a christmas present (after much nagging from me!), the catalogue picture impressed me greatly and it led to me getting this wonderful kit, I've been car mad since I was 3 years old (and I still am at 32!), I had all kinds of corgi cars and other toy cars, I saw this with it's working V4 engine and transmission and just wanted it, you know how it is when you're 9! I attempted to start it on the Christmas morning but I just ended up building a house with it, and when I used to build Lego houses, it was a technical work of art, complete with floors, internal walls, fitted kitchen and a bathroom and even cavity external walls! Anyway, I finally decided to build the car in 1990 about 18 months after getting the kit and I loved it, stayed assembled for about 6 months, albeit modified a few times in that time, added extra lights and worked out how to make the back bit over the engine swing up like a clamshell, the kit then turned into a Coach after it was in it's intended state (8865 Test Car), my Lego bricks have had many, many incarnations in their time, I always used to love building my houses though. <br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,2,3
"Victor_c3","2012-08-10T13:46:20.07Z","Amazing set for the time","<p>I'm writing this as I thought of the set in 1990, not today. From today's perspective, I'd give it 2.5s all the way down for scores. From 1990's perspective, I give it 5s all the way down for scores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently re-dug out my legos after not touching them since about 1995 and I've been rebuilding many of my former sets as an adult with the help of my 2 and 4 year old daughters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set was completely awesome when I got it. It added a huge number of parts to my collection and served as the backbone of the pieces and colors that I played with for years. At the time I was awed by the complexity and, for an 11 year old, it took me what seemed like forever to build it (probably 6-8 hours). The suspension, differentials, engine, transmission, etc were all amazing to me and provided a lot of play for me. The only other set from the era that I liked more would have been the 8868 airclaw-rig (and that one was issued several years later, so I guess it isn't even the same era).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, for nostalgia purposes, this set was amazing for its time. However, by todays standards, it is really lacking in the areas mentioned by other reviewers already.&nbsp;The modern lego models are much more aesthetically pleasing, complex, feature packed, and solid. I let my four year old play with this, and she totally had it ripped apart through what I'd call normal play. Conversly, I just put together the 8421 (mobile crane)&nbsp;and my girls have been playing with that (without it completely falling appart) for about a week now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I remember right, this set was going for about $100-$115 around 1990 which, after adjusting for inflation, makes it about $180 in 2010 dollars. I believe that this set had just under 900 pieces which makes it a pretty poor value when you compare it to the 8110 (unimog) or even the 8043 (motorized excavator) which have roughly 2100 and 1100 pieces respectively when you look at the inflation adjusted prices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After getting back into lego and buying a few modern sets it is apparent just how far the complexity of the models has come.&nbsp;If you looking for a set that is amazing by today's standards, skip over it. Save&nbsp;this set&nbsp;for the collectors. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"TheDorienGrey","2022-01-08T16:29:04.933Z","My first large set as a kid","<p>I got this set new as a kid. Not sure the year of the release. I would have been around 10.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I took completely apart and rebuilt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After doing more than a few newer Lego sets I can safely say our instructions have come a long way, or been dumbed down, depending on your view point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some steps feature over 35+ parts with zero yellow highlighting.</p>

<p>Highly recommend counting out the parts for each step. That way you know if you miss something. It&#39;s VERY easy to miss a part.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other build issue is there are a few places where the angle doesn&#39;t allow you to properly see exactly where you are to place something causing a very easy mistake that won&#39;t be caught until you are very far forward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said despite those minor issues it&#39;s a fun, historical build. Loved seeing things as they were before all the downsizing and refinement.</p>

<p>Features four working Pistons, front and rear double wishbone suspension, 3 speed transmission with neutral, plus pop up headlights and adjustable seats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t build the alternative build due to it looking fairly challenging with minimal steps. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s cool, but it looks like it would be a very tricky build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all this is a great history lesson in technic and one of the greatest early builds.</p>
