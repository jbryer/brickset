"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-05T23:24:14Z","Best Technic Model Ever Designed","8868 was the last set I was given by somebody else (for Christmas when I was 15) - since then I have had to buy my own.  8868's functionality is second to none, but what makes it really stand apart from most other sets is the enormous scope to modify the model yourself - the increasing in size of the claw arm was the first modification I remember making, followed by stabilisers, two air tanks for the compressor (which meant the pneumatic functions went on forever), altering the chassis to accommodate the slightly larger wheels from the Black Cat Rig, adding a backup manual pump, and winches back and front.

Any one of these alterations illustrates the delightful scope this model has to be altered very easily - I even saw one that had been nicely converted into a mobile anti-aircraft gun.  I think these changes do not suggest deficiencies in the original model, but rather its ability (above all other Technic models I can think of) to inspire creativity and innovation in the person who has built it.

If pressed to think of a favourite feature of this model, I would say that I especially enjoyed the array of pneumatic tubes directly underneath the cab - the way that 12 tubes spread out to their 4 switches looks almost organic, and a little like a ribcage.  Its a really nice feature that demonstrates good organisation in limited space.  Of course, that little feature spends most of its time completely hidden.

If I had a gun held to my head and was forced to think of something I didn't like so much about this set was perhaps the engine housing - the front was a little flimsy - and perhaps the bullbars, which can be done much more realistically with the newer coloured axels, or angled axel joiners.

But those are very minor nitpicks.  It is a very cool set even without any changes being made. 

Since then I have watched Technic sets take a very depressing downhill slide.  In particular, all the pseudo-Technic monstrosities made 2002-2004, and even more criminal are the studless models - very clever and all, but it makes life very difficult for those of us who actually like to modify existing models.

Get a pen.  Write down &quot;Lego Technic 8868&quot;, and then try and find one in an auction, or in the back of a toyshop where nobody has been in 20 years.  You need one of these fine models, that represent Technic when it was still really, really cool.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T21:33:03Z","Compact and well designed model","I got this model for Christmas present when I was 11 years old. Electrical pneumatic compressor was something I was dreaming about since the first time I built a pneumatic model, so I was/am really happy with this model. It works really great and the arm is stronger than I thought it would be. The model has a good and sturdy design. A major drawback (as with all electric Lego models) is the cost of batteries. (However, I still prefer a electric Lego model any day). I never built the secondary model (I was happy with the primary and I did not have the time), so I do not know how it compares. Features include 5 pneumatic cylinders, movable engine cylinders, and (of course) steering. I can really recommend this interesting and feature-rich model to anyone interested in technic LEGO motors and/or LEGO pneumatics - this model has both! :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2006-12-27T21:22:50Z","A Pneumatics tour de force ","When I bought this model through Ebay I was not sure it would live up to the great reviews on Brickset. I need not have worried, it is a master piece of Lego Technic design.
The grab arm is similar in principle to the earlier JCB but the pneumatic slewing action as very clever. This model is really jam packed inside, it is hard to image how you could get any more in. The down side to this is that much of the really neat bits are completely hidden, however it still makes me smile when you pick up, move and place a object, all by remote control.
About the only criticism is really only cosmetic. It looks much nicer with double rear tires.
This is a seriously complex model and is a very satisfying challenge to build.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"kari","2007-11-19T04:48:06.077Z","Best Technic for best Christmas","<p>All began at a snowy Christmas in&nbsp;1994. The set had been released in 1992, but my father could buy it only two years later for me as things were not so easy in Hungary at that time. I was so lucky, thanks to him,&nbsp;that I could choose between 8868 and 8880, but my decision was unambiguous. It was my first huge Technic set and - still the best.</p>

<p>The building of the LEGO set&nbsp;took hours under the Christmas tree with my elder brother and nearly midnight it was completed. Words can not describe the feeling when the truck&#39;s compressor and pneumatic system was first put into operation. Despite the fact, that since then I was honoured to build many of LEGO Technic&#39;s supersets (such as 8880, 8421 and 8455), I&nbsp;still say that this one is above all.</p>

<p>With the aesthetic, LEGO did an excellent work. The only two things, that I would mention if I definitely have to, are the sparing on the rear wheels (it should have double wheels on all the four rear axels) and the V6 engine (instead of the real truck&#39;s V8). Otherwise, the model looks real, and I love the colour combination (black, white, and yellow) of it. Of course there are no rearview mirrors or steering wheel, but hey boy, this one is from classic times.</p>

<p>The technic/function is the strongest part of the rig. The pneumatics (even the turning of the crane is executed by pneumatic cylinders) work automatically thanks to the 9 Volt engine driven compressor system, which produces air constantly. The only thing you have to do is controlling (like in real life) by the four valves settled on both sides. The net of the pneumatic tubes looks great underneath and this is the most difficult part to put together during the building process. The truck has V6 engine with cooling fan driven by two (!) differentials from the rear wheels. The steering works well.</p>

<p>I remember this set costed a little fortune back then,&nbsp;but it was worth every penny. My model still works as if it were new. If Technic is the ultimate LEGO, then 8868 Air Tech Claw Rig is the ultimate Technic.</p>

"dunx125","2007-11-27T11:17:48.497Z","Absolutely brilliant - best technic set I own","i got this set, as well as some other Technic sets from the 90s for the ridiculous price of $115. It took me about 8 hours to build - the threading of the pneumatic tubes through the various holes was especially difficult. The technical functions are amazing - just like operating a real crane! You turn the motor, and then fiddle with the switches, and you can make the crane pick up anything you want. Anyway, hers the pros and cons:

Pros
&gt;Fantastic and sturdy design
&gt;4 seperate functions controlled by pneumatics
&gt;Looks great
&gt;Pneumatic features are powered by a compressor,
which makes it much easier to control the crane.
&gt;Steering and engine work perfectly

Cons
&gt;The pneumatic-powered rotation of the crane seems to be rather jumpy (it may be due to a mistake I made in construction)

If you get the oppurtunity to get this set, buy it. You won't regret it!

"bizkit","2008-09-21T10:07:21.42Z","Masterpiece!","It's the best Technic set I've ever seen! Unfortunately I don't have it. I only hope that Lego will make this kind of sets in the future again. The compressor-pneumatic system was a great idea (although with air tank would be even better), it makes the set easier to control, you don't have to pump air manually. 
The last greater pneumatic sets I've seen was back in 2004, since then almost none. At least Lego should re-release them, again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Aqualize","2010-01-07T05:39:54.827Z","One set to rule them all","This was biggest set I got as I child (I think I'm turning a AFOL now and will buy some big stuff soon). I don't remember to which Christmas it was but it was on sale (saw the price tag on the box now) and I was afraid (I was a young boy at the time!) that they wouldn't sell it to mom as I was not 12+ years old (the recommended year limit by Lego). Haha, of course they sold it :)

The machine is very impressive and I think every Lego technic fan should have one, this is one of the classics.
My favorite part is the turn-able crane (I always like the most functional parts of technic sets). One reviewer wrote that the rotation of the crane was a bit jumpy, mine is that too. But that is just minor things. The crane is strong but the claw is not so strong. I mounted the cherry picker model from http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8042-1 in the claw but use of a some technic axles so it was firmly set. The pneumatic was able to lift and stretch out the crane with this heavy load! Unfortunately it could not rotate then (perhaps if the turntable was made with ball-bearing).

And I agree with another reviewer about air tanks. I don't know any set with that so I don't exactly how big they are but it is a disappointment that the two (one on each side) white tanks are just fakes. This model is worth real Lego air tanks. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DrFrankenstein","2015-03-20T00:41:15.253Z","The legend returns","<p>Brilliant, ingenious, astounding... the only way to describe 8868 is in the highest of superlatives. The king of all studded Technic sets totally deserves the glowing accolades that generations of fans have bestowed upon it. The iconic status of the set that ruled the 90s has not faded a single bit over the decades. While the aura of sentimental values adds to this set&#39;s fame, it&#39;s really the design, engineering quality, innovation, and playability that distinguish 8868 from its peers.</p>

<p>I recently got the chance to purchase a used 8868 from the second-hand market in reasonable condition. It was dusty, some bits were missing, a couple white parts had started to show signs of yellowing, and the box lid had unglued from the base. The set clearly had seen better times and was in need of some loving care (understand - dusting, rinsing, b<span class=""rangySelectionBoundary"" id=""selectionBoundary_1426805712381_0294693592259474"" style=""line-height: 0; display: none;"">?</span>rick hunting). One can get copies of the set in way better condition than this, but for the price that I paid for it, I could not complain. A couple days worth of work and the set was back to its former glory. And indeed, what a glory it was - I was shocked how good 8868 looks still in 2015, 23 years after its birth (which in Technic years is a very respectable retirement age).</p>

<p>The very first look at the box sets the stage for a luxurious joyous build experience that is characteristic of the best Technic sets from the 90s. Next, the building table is overtaken by all kinds of wonderful and unique Technic bricks in all shapes and colors. The pneumatics take central position in the symphony, followed by the electrics (yes, the 9V motor looks solid to the bone), surrounded by cogs, wheels, elastics, and all sorts of other goodies. The build gets off to a promising start with the introduction of the rear differentials and holds its excitement to the grand finale when you are ready to press the on button and the pneumatics spring into action to the astonishment of the public...</p>

<p>But wait a second! When I pressed the lever directing the rear superstructure to turn, all I got back was a grinding sound - the thing barely moved. Yikes! A quick analysis of the situation revealed that my loving fiance, who helped with a big part of the build, had left a little surprise (even though I thought that I had keept an eye at what she was doing and corrected her occasional errors early on). The two parallel pistons that rotate the turnable where anchored one stud closer to the rear of the truck than they were supposed to be and the toothed plates were not catching well on the cog in the middle. Luckily, I managed to detach the superstructure from the base and shift the toothed plates one stud closer to the front to compensate for incorrect position of the pistons. Voila - the turntable worked like a charm under the action of the pneumatic forces. This is to illustrate the complexity of the build - one has to be carful to position all the elements precisely and route/connect all of the dozens of hoses that power this beast just right. Get it wrong and you will end up scratching your head. Get it right and you will be treated to the flawless pneumatic spectacle packed in the Claw Rig!</p>

<p>I am enamored with the finished 8868. It looks fantastic with the yellow, white, red, and gray colors perfectly balancing the classy black base color. The shape of the truck is amazingly realistic and awe inspiring. Did I mention, the whole contraption feels rock solid (for a LEGO, that is) thanks to its parallel beams construction. The HOG wheel is super responsive and precise - something we rarely see in the modern Technic models. The engine has been geared up perfectly to the point that the engine fan spins beautifully when the truck is in motion, while the engine makes a very cool sound that is as realistic as it gets with Technic. The compressor, which is in the heart of 8868, works wonderfully with a very real-life like sound as well. It would have been nice if the decorative air storage tanks on the side of the truck were of the real kind, but it&#39;s an understandable omission since these were introduced in 1997 (5 years after 8868). Interestingly enough, the pneumatics in the set work wonderfully even without storage tanks, thanks to the numerous flexible pneumatic tubes that can absorb some pressure build up and act as an energy store. In fact, the operation of the rig is delightfully smooth if you work the valves with a fine touch.</p>

<p>The claw rig is one of the most playable Technic models that I have ever touched. The valves are positioned perfectly for two-hands operation and with just a little practice you can make the rig bow to your wishes. The claw boom is very articulated and works great for shifting objects around the radius of the rig. It&#39;s super cool too that the rotation of the superstructure is pneumatic, as well as that you have the ability to &quot;park&quot; the claw at the end of the work day by grabbing on the white beam in the rear of the truck.</p>

<p>Do you need any more convincing in the superiority of 8868 (like you didn&#39;t know already)? Don&#39;t take it from me - go read the other reviews that folks have written about this remarkable set. And if you haven&#39;t had the joy of owning one, you are missing on one of the greatest LEGO sets ever (perhaps, even the top Technic of all times). If I were to have to give up all the sets in my collection and could keep just one, 8868 would be my choice. This set is the very epitome of the goodness of Technic - a pinnacle achievement in brick engineering of the highest class!</p>

<p>Did you know that lego&nbsp;air tanks beautifully replace the mock standard ones with just a long axle and some pins to hold them on? Did you know you can get white air tanks?&nbsp;Well you can and although the mini compressor takes a while to charge the twin tanks it&#39;s great!! A double compressor setup 180 degrees out of phase with the original&nbsp;would really make this model fly,&nbsp;I&#39;ve yet to develop this but as I&#39;m typing I think it&#39;s something that needs to be completed!</p>

<p>The build is simple, but you have to pay attention with the hose routings, and get inventive when you add the plumbing for the air tanks (turntable cylinders turned up side down and hose runs are underneath).</p>

<p>If I can get one cheap enough I&#39;ll buy another to make the B model, and make the rear area solid like the unimog and arocs so it can actually hold and tip!</p>

"ludovisser","2019-01-18T21:28:18.25Z","Iconic set with surprising B-model","<p>Many have written of how awesome this set is. And they&#39;re not lying. I desperately wanted this model as a kid, and remember building it and playing with it fondly.</p>

<p>The primary model is awesome: the pneumatics are wonderful, especially the rather ingenious way in which the crane is rotated using two antagonistic cylinders. The pneumatics, with all the associated tubing, fully pack the model, so its amazing that not only&nbsp;have they managed to include&nbsp;also a motorized compressor, but there&#39;s also a V6 engine&nbsp;driven by 2 rear-axle&nbsp;differentials. For me as a kid this set was a endlessly enjoyable to play with.</p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more! The B-model. It&#39;s supposed to be a garbage collector, I think, and it&#39;s admittedly not very pretty, which may be why it&#39;s often overlooked. Undeserved, because it&#39;s probably the most ingenious Technic model in existence.</p>

<p>I remember when I built it I couldn&#39;t figure out how it worked: where in the A-model the compressor has a tube going to the center nozzle of the switches and then distributed to each nozzle of a cylinder, the B-model has tubing going everywhere. Also cylinders are in weird places, with cylinders actuating switches even! Only when you finish the model turn it on it&#39;s clear what you&#39;ve built: a pneumatic sequencer! With the compressor running, the model will close the grabber, lift the arm to the cargo area in the back, open the grabber and bring the arm back down. It was many years later that I fully understood what was going on there.</p>

<p>I recommend getting this set, build the B-model, be amazed, and then build the A-model for it&#39;s stunning good looks (even now) and playability.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong>&nbsp;None of the sets had their box or instructions, 8868 didn&#39;t&nbsp;have them either.</li>

	<li><strong>Parts:</strong>&nbsp;Even for the time period, the parts are really cool, and work very well. The motor surprised me with how fast it was. &nbsp;The amount&nbsp;of parts is great as well.</li>

	<li><strong>Build:&nbsp;</strong>The build was unfortunately&nbsp;confusing at times, and it was frustrating to build in the pneumatic parts, but the build was worth it.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Completed Model: </strong>The finished model looks really nice, even for 1992. Its also pretty big. Now, what can the model do? First of all, the roof-top steering is very smooth and responsive, and when you push the truck, the V6 engine in the front turns making a satisfying sound. And for the pneumatics? They&nbsp;work&nbsp;wonderfully! &nbsp;There are two switches on either side of the truck that control the four functions of the crane:&nbsp;rotating superstructure, lifting and lowering shoulder and elbow, and grabbing claw. All of these work well and with some practice, they can be operated fluidly.</li>
