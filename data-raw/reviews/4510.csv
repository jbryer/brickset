This set is so underrated. Huge, lots of part, cool alternate model - Lego should make more sets like these.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"martin_ffm","2008-03-20T10:09:34.937Z","so much fun with this set!!","I really like this set, the forklift itsself is quite nice to play and does look realistic. Especially if you build yourself some goods to transport. And the truck with the trailer is also nice. The most I like is probably to drive around with the complete truck, especially backwards. This is really fun, and some serious training ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
