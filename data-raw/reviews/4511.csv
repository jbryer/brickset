"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-12T21:39:15Z","My favourite in design","I got this model on Christmas when I was 13 years old. It was my last Lego model I got for present, and I had lots of fun building it. It is still in one piece even though it has gotten some bumps and bruises through the years - the model is very sturdy. I also own the 8865 and I think this (the 8880) is a lot more beautiful, better designed and more cool features. This is a must-have for any real technic Lego fan! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-22T08:56:59Z","Wonderful Technic set","Lego 8880 is one of the best ever Technic set designed. It is really cool. It has 8-cylinder engine with piston movements, independent suspensions on all 4 wheels, 4-wheel drive (with 3 differentials), 4-speed gearbox, 4-wheel steering, popup headlamps so on. Its size is huge. I wonder how Lego engineers make such complex things like drive train looks so simple! Before looking into this model, I could hardly figure out how a 4-wheel drive system works in cars! Sure, some people say 8448 is better model, but 8880 is more like Lego where as 8448 is towards some artistic sense. I wish one day Lego include brake &amp; clutch in their cars!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-22T07:04:57Z","Simply awesome!","I bought this set from my friend yesterday and I have to say, that this is almost my best Technic set. I have in my collection 8448 Super Street Sensation, 8461 F1 Williams, 8466 4x4 Offroader, 8436 Pneumatic Truck, 8858 Rebel Wrecker and 8838 Motorbike and now this Super Car 8880 as my latest purchase.
I bought this set as an second hand model, my friend got it in Christmas 1994, but I have to say for his credit, that the set was in excellent condition. There were only a couple of yelloed white pieces and some dusty black pieces, but after a little cleaning with toothbrush I managed to make it look like a new one.
So the functions of this set. I think that almost every Technic set fans know the features, but for the people, which doesn't know anything about this set, I'm glad to tell you...
So, first there is a suspension in every wheel. There's a modification site in the Internet, where you can alterate the suspension system. The address is http://www.sehrschnell.com. Take a look how sport suspension is made.
Secondly, there is 4WD in this car, so that every wheel deliver the power to the motor.
There is also 4 Wheel steering, which is kind of rare in Technic. Back wheels are turning 1/2 as slow as front wheels.
Then there is 4-Speed manual gearbox, 4 speeds forward, no reverse.
The motor is working with chains like motorbikes. It is a V8 with fan.
Last feature is a opening booth. When opened, you can check the motor and repair it or customized it.
The count of pieces is more 1350, so there is plenty of building found in here. It took me 4 1/2 hours to build.
Alltough this a great model, I prefer the sleek and beautiful design and looks of 8448 Super Sensation. I have to admit tough, that the building of 8880 Super Car was quite a challenging task to do, because there is so much to do at the same time, not like when you build 8448, which is devided in to sections.
If you manage to find it, I recommend that you buy it, if you are a lego fan or Technic enthusiast. But I have to warn you, this model is very hard to find! I was lucky, because my friend was kind enough to sell it to me! I searched after it almost 2 years, but there were no new ones in Finland, so I have to buy a second hand model.
Have fun when building this superb model!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-23T05:56:56Z","It has so many features...","With the four-wheel steering, independent suspension on all wheels and four wheel drive with 4 gear ratios and a V8, this set is packed with techniques. With over 1,400 pieces, it's a must for every technic fan.

Although the whole body consists of bricks instead of the new studless things or panels, it's really well shaped. I don't want to call this blocky, it's a magnificant use of the hinge plates that are used all over.

A nice added feature are the headlights, which can be raised and lowered, like in some real cars. Compared to the newer 8448, it has much more features. Although it has no doors, it is a really good model. My only complaint is that you can't sit in this car too confortably... with a beam between you legs... but that's minor. If you don't have it, get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-27T16:51:56Z","Awesome!!!"," I got this off a mate for an unbelievable &#163;10!!! An absolute steal! One of the best &#163;10 I ever spent. In short this car has everything in 4's. 4 wheel-drive, which is one of my features. It also boasts 4 wheel-steering and has 4 wheel independent suspension, which for its time is a marvel. It also contains a 4-speed gearbox, the first one of its kind. I only know of 2 other models with a gearbox system (the 8480 Space Shuttle and the 8448 Supercar). If that’s not enough for anyone it also has working pop-up headlights and an opening trunk.

I love the 4 wheel-drive on this thing. The way it has been put together by Lego designers is ingenious! I have never seen anything like it. The wheels are connected to the differential gears when they are not even on the same level (the suspension pushes the wheels down and raises the car along with the differentials). Universal joints play a major part here. It is great watching it in action.

There is a secondary steering wheel placed near the roof, which preferably can be used instead of the actual steering wheel in the cockpit. Getting your hands inside to the actual steering wheel can leave you with scratches from the beams holding it together. The steering is also a bit stiff but I guess this is the price you pay for 4 wheel steering.

The suspension is much tougher than the 8448 and the car will take a fair amount of road/table abuse. The seats look great as do the pop-up headlights which can be operated from inside the cockpit. These provide that extra little touch which separates this car from the 8448.

It truly is a Supercar and is one of the last few 'true' Lego cars before the introduction of flexible axles, cowling plates and studless liftarms. It looks authentic. It is pleasure to own and display.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-11T19:49:20Z","Water under the bridge","
The 8880 represents a bridge between the old (853, 8860, 8865) and new (8448, 8466) big car sets.  There is a nice mix of parts in this kit, enough to satisfy those who favor the old-style studded beams, while providing enough creative elements on which to apply the newer and more distinct Lego technologies.

The features of the 8880 are illustrated very well in the other reviews.  I just wanted to say that I like the way that Technic pieces have developed over the years.  The old-school Technic pieces (any part found in the 853, for example) were an obvious improvement on non-Technic bricks (because you could now build working motors, transmissions, etc; a big step forward from the world of pretend).  Lego next added a few even-newer pieces, like locking angles, to second-generation Technic sets (like 8845 and 8846) -- they were a little strange, but OK.  After all, it was nice to finally have shock absorbers (instead of using the rubber band/connecting peg trick).

Then my Lego Dark Age started, so I can't account for the Technic sets between the mid-1980s and the late 90s, hopefully someone else can fill in here.  But after recently resuming Legoland citizenship and acquiring some newer sets (8466 chief among them), it's hard not to compare the new sets (with their non-studded beams, wide variety of gear sizes and wheels, and much more specialized parts) to the old sets (with their ubiquitous and excitingly chunky pieces).  

To sum up the comparison, the challenge with the old sets was &quot;how can I get these general pieces to do what I want&quot;.  With the new sets, it seems to be &quot;how can I make use of these specialized pieces, they have such specific functions that it’s not easy to place them”.  Different sides of the same coin.  

As long as Lego pieces continue to be manufactured to their usual standard of durability and colorfastness, then it’s hard to argue against the continuing evolution of parts (how else will Lego be able to offer a front-wheel drive front-engine supercar sometime in the future?).  The idea behind the growth and change of parts may be &quot;Can you build with the newer pieces?  Good, go have fun.  Do you favor the old-style pieces?  Great – go buy old sets off Ebay or somewhere.&quot;  Both styles are widely available for your experimentation pleasure, no matter what age the calendar says you are.  

Be that as it may, the 8880 is a great set on every level.  It represents a vital step in the Lego supercar progression sequence, and gets a 10/10 for all the features enthusiastically described elsewhere on this page.  25 June 2004",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"quorneng","2007-02-19T09:52:55.14Z","The last of the true Technic big cars","This is an amazingly complex model that for the most part still uses &quot;conventional&quot; Technic Lego construction. For the technically minded it has neat two-way dog clutches in the gear box and real constant velocity joints in the wheel hubs. Although front and rear steering is a bit unrealistic for a super car, it does give the model a reasonably tight turning circle. The &quot;skeleton&quot; body work is cleverly done (what a lot of hinges) and surprisingly strong.
Personally I &quot;locked&quot; the rear steering (which much simplified the steering mechanism) and redesigned the suspension a bit to be slightly softer but with longer travel. Would this be possible on the later 'studless' designs?

"Starstreak","2009-08-10T02:05:03.653Z","One of THE best TECHNIC sets ever!","I did a major review with photos and video here:

http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=30063&hl=

Here is the closing from that review:

Features
Having to remember this is not a REAL car, this Technic set really shows how a hi-tech car would work in a simplified layout. It has working suspension, Four wheel steering and drive. Working four gear ratios. A working headlights that open and close. Working trunk. Also a working engine and working Limited Slip Differentials for both front and rear. 

My rating:
Playability: 5/5. When compared to other Technic sets, I don't think Lego has outdid this for a model of a car yet. Even my 8448 Lego Super Street Sensation can't hold up to all the technical wizardry that Lego put into this set. 
Design: 5/5. If a Technic set could have labels like UCS, This would be one of them. This is a show car that I'm glad I cleaned up. I just hope it'll last another 5 years so my son will appreciate this set for what it does.
Build experience: 5/5. Comparing it to other Technic sets, this is hard. It's no walk in the park. There is no numbered bags to open, and some parts as I mentioned before, need to either be removed to shimmy in the piece they now want you to add, or bent a little to get it into its spot. Once in, it fits snuggly. But I don't remember in recent years, where parts needed to be inserted that way. And for each step of the build, they give you allot to put in. Not like some Star Wars set that have you placing 2 pieces for one instruction number. We're talking like over 10-30 pieces at one frame of instruction!
Overall: 5/5. Well worth buying. Not sure if it's worth paying $350+ for it new, but I know if it came out for $200, I would still see if I could find the cash to get it. Remember, it ""only"" has 1300+ pieces.

"Time4TT","2008-12-22T02:13:51.543Z","4th large Lego car - all the bells &amp; whistles!","Lego pulled out all the stops here, producing a car which did all the major things a real car did, and more. Finally power was driven through the front wheels (hard to do when you also need to handle steering and suspension). Not content with that Lego added four wheel drive (with three slip differentials). Car manufacturers around this time were toying with four wheel steering, and Lego got in on the fad by adding their own flavour. Like the systems used, the rear wheels steered less than the front wheels to allow for a smaller turning circle.

Popup headlight were a little disappointing compared to 8865 (the previous large car model) as they just flipped lego bricks around and didn't really lock in position correctly. Lego fixed the steering problem by adding a small steering rod at the top of the car to make it easier to play with - something they added to all subsequent cars.

The trunk / boot lifted up to show the (still rear) engine. This model also wasn't as good as 8865 in construction. It failed my 2ft &quot;drop test&quot; ;o).

However, this is the mother of all Lego cars. Never again would more features be put on a car to make one wondering just how they managed to squeeze so many features into so small a space with Lego pieces!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alileighju","2009-05-01T11:29:40.763Z","Best Technic Set Ever","I got this set on eBay and I must say, it is pretty much one of the best sets I own. I won't go into detail about its features as other reviewers have undoubtedly gone into it already.

Instead I'll try to focus on things other people haven't written. 

Overall, this car is HUGE! it's so big I am tempted to hug it every time I see it (A bit prickly).
In terms of stability, it couldn't get any more solid or stable. There are no loose pieces and the car can take some rough play and handling thanks a lot to the dual suspensions for each tyre. (the car is quite bouncy)

The only gripes I had with this set was the top rubber steering wheel can sometimes be hard to reach and that you have to rotate the wheel so much just to get a tiny degree of steer and the steering can be quite stiff at times. The top rubber steering wheel is also too small in my opinion and continues to turn after the maximum steer is made for the wheels thanks to the rubber wheel which isn't attached to the plastic bit.
The other gripe I had is the steering mechanism for each tyre is connected by a single connector beam which is ""clipped"" onto these 2 tiny round things. This part frequently breaks off especially when you try to directly force turn the tyres.

I'd have to say the gears system and the suspension are my favourite parts of this set as well as the overall look of the car - very awesome.

Another little thing worth mentioning is the front head lights - they are directly printed onto the bricks and are not stickers which I think everyone here can agree upon is SUPER COOL AND SO MUCH BETTER THAN STUPID STICKERS.

The openable trunk to reveal the engine and the mechanism to let it stay open is also worth a mention.

One last mention is to the tyres of the 8880. They are very cool and the biggest tyres in I have ever seen in LEGO.

"bambalero","2009-04-26T21:15:29.53Z","Superb Lego Car","I bought this set through Ebay. It costed me a good deal - 230 USD.
I was so happy won the bidding! - but-- when I received the set, I noticed that all the white pieces and almost all the gray ones had the color faded or yellowish due to the sun decoloration.

So, I searched bricklink and bought all the spares, which costed me about 200 USD extra. Finally almost 2 months later after receiving the set, I was finally able to build it. I had to paint the wheels and the gear shift piece.

I have to say - you do need to separate the pieces, if you want to build it rather quickly. I am an expert builder and still took me 8 hrs.

This is a great model to build. It is much more complete than the 8865, and there are many details that make you amaze - like the All wheel drive, the V8 motor, the 4 gear shift that really works. It is great to see how the gears combine to spin the motor quicker or slower. I did like the way the headlights move. The suspension works great. The back from the car raises so you can see the motor.

The model looks nice, but I would change the cylinder heads from dark gray to yellow and the motor from light gray to transparent. I would have changed the way the wheels are attached - I don´t like the pressure on the wheels.

Bottom line - it is a set you definitely have to have if you are a LEGO fan. I recommend applying spray sunblock on it to avoid damage from the sun. You can also apply Armor All to the wheels - it makes them shiny and protects them too. Remember that there is no way to correct the sun decoloration - either buy new pieces or paint them.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Sadly, I don't have the box, but what I can see from the pictures is that it's a very nice box. Not like boxes today that are just a bit of cardboard. The boxes back then were like a showcase.</p><p>There is 1 big instructions book in the set for both the A and the B model (a F1 car). They're very clear, but a challenge to build with (you'll read later on why).</p><p><br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are great. You get these nice wheels, 8 suspension, some other parts that only came in this set (like the white steering arms and the gearbox piece).</p><p>Furthermore you get a lot of gears, beams (the old studded type) and many black hinge pieces.</p><p><br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is amazing (if you like a challenge). It's not like today with a few parts per step, this is older: you have to place like 30 parts per step (maybe even more). That's really nice, it really gives the feeling you've accomplished something when you're done.</p><p>Furthermore the build goes very smoothly. No problems in the instructions.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model is very strong. Because it's made with the studded technic bricks, the chassis is stronger than you'll ever get with new beams. Such a strong chassis is needed though, because the model is very heavy. The model has the following functions:</p><ul><li>Front and rear steering</li><li>Front, middle and rear differntial</li><li>A fake V8 engine (with moving pistons)</li><li>Independent suspension on all wheels</li><li>4 speed gearbox<br></li><li>HOG (hand of god) steering and steering using the steering wheel</li><li>The trunk can be opened to view the engine</li><li>You can open and close the headlights</li></ul><p>That's a nice list, isn't it? And the best part is: everything works very nice!</p><p>The only complaint I have about the functions is something about the suspension: it has a cracking noise (not the suspension parts itself, but just the whole construction). Nothing to be worried about, it's just a bit annoying.</p><p>The working steering wheel is a nice touch too. You won't see that in new Technic sets anymore (sadly).</p><p>The looks of the car are nice. Some people think it's ugly, some people think it's beatiful. I'm in between: from some angles it looks nice, from some angles it looks less. But we have to keep in mind: this set is from 1994. All in all it has a nice aggresive look, a bit like an older lamborghini.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this is a great set and now I understand why this is a holy grail for many Technic collectors. Many functions, good looks, nice parts. Does it have a real downside?

"DrFrankenstein","2016-03-28T22:44:12.047Z","Top Studded Supercar","<p>I built 8880 last year and meant to leave a review, but somehow never got down to it. FlagsNZ&#39;s excellent review of the model reminded me that I have it on my to do list.</p>

<p>Let me start by joining the choir and say that I am very impressed by 8880. While I have never really been a sworn fan of Technic supercars, I can&#39;t help but marvel at the engineering qualities of the black supercar from 1994. The suspension and transmission are a case study of what can me achieved with Technic. The bodywork is beautiful, for a studded beam design this is. Even though it looks like a mashup of beams coming at all sorts of angles, make no mistake - this is solid and perfectly sturdy. The hatch opening and pop-up lights are nice functions.</p>

<p>One thing I also like about this model is that the suspension springs can easily attached and detached from the top. This is important if you put the model in storage as detaching the spring helps relieve the tension on the suspension elements.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t decide if I like 8880 or 8070 better. 8880 has this wonderful 90&#39;s design and cool studded look. Its skeletal body frame exposes a lot of mechanics of the model for studying. On the other hand, 8070 has slicker more modern look with all the panels at work. It rolls smoother than 8880 due to its simpler drive and steering.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Technic supercars have always been first and foremost display models with somewhat limited playability. Their complexity focuses on the steering and drive where they shine. The tradeoff is that all these gears, linkages, and super-sized tires are stiff to steer. This is perhaps the Lego equivalent of large vehicle with no power steering. In 8880 this problem is particularly evident with the hard to reach hand-of-god control struggling against the resistance of the 4-wheel steering.</p>

<p>While I am not sure that 8880 is the best Technic model of all times, it certainly holds its place in my top 10 list. When it comes to pinnacle sets from the 90s there are a couple sets that fare quite well against 8880 and may be even better than it (8868, 8480, 8479, etc) in terms of playability, complexity, and looks. Yet, this is one of the best supercars that was ever designed and deserves to be studied upclose. Go get it if you have the chance.</p>

"fhansson","2011-10-13T06:52:45.743Z","Engineering department gone mad!","<p>For many this is the holy grail of Technic Lego, for me it's not. I was a teenager by the time this came out and a friend of mine got this one. I was already ""too old"" to play with Lego but this was something else. It's more for adults than kids. The building experience needed is probably the highest ever on any set. With a set containing almost 1400 parts (!) you wonder what was going on in the minds of the developers. The details needs no more explanation, this one got it all! Gearbox, pistons, 4WD, suspension etc.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But.. I think the biggest flaw on this car is that it lacks playability! Once builded it was just a ""dustcollector"" in the bookshelf to impress friends rather than a fun toy. It looks cool and impressive but it is too big and complicated to do anything with it. Combined with a high price tag I think this is beyond what Lego is all about. For that money you could buy a RC car and have a lot more fun actually playing with it.</p>",TRUE,3,5,5,1,2

"FlagsNZ","2016-01-02T09:23:27.113Z","8880 Super Car marks the pinnacle of 'Brick Built' Technic engineering","<p>For many Technic AFOL enthusiasts, 8880 Super Car marks the pinnacle&nbsp;of what can be achieved with completely <em>brick-built </em>Technic engineering. This set is the flagship Technic set for 1994 and has gone into Technic lore of what&nbsp;can be achieved with&nbsp;good engineering using the original brick-built techniques.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As with all significant Technic sets, 8880 Super Car comes in a large box. The front of the box has a great image of the car superimposed over a 1:1 scale profile.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/24091291146_31cf428181_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, my box has seen better days.</p>

<p>The rear of the box shows the B model which is a Formula 1 Car, which could be a stand-alone set by itself.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/23490561113_70ef82ae8c_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>LEGO used to include a plastic sorting tray with these big boxes. Today, sets come in numbered bags instead. I&#39;m not sure which format I prefer: the numbered bags segregates parts during the build experience when new but having a sorting tray is a convenient&nbsp;way of&nbsp;making future builds easier to manage.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5659/23749573069_eed170a21e_o.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 577px;"" /></p>

<p>The instructions are bound in one book. The B model instructions start at the rear cover and work back toward the middle of the book. This set was produced in an age before B model instructions could be downloaded from the Internet.</p>

<p>My instructions have pages 16/17 as a corrected insert. Build step 18 has been corrected by replacing a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/273602"">ball with cross axle</a>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/662826"">ball with friction snap</a>&nbsp;as the steering knuckles.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1450/23490562813_a13c7e22f2_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>As both my 8880 Super Car sets have been bought second hand, I do not know whether this is an actual design error or simply incorrect graphics in the instructions; I suspect that it is just the artwork that is at fault as the <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/6540b"">steering arm</a> receives the friction snap pin.</p>

<p>There is a mixture of printed parts and stickers. The sticker sheet has an alternative dashboard and Octan sponsorship for the B model -&nbsp;Formula 1 race car.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5634/23490563553_7f32dba325_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 1343 parts divided into 36 building steps. This means that there are several steps that have more than&nbsp;30 parts allocated to them; a far cry from today&#39;s style of having only a few pieces per building step.</p>

<p>As an example, here is build step 29 which includes 42 pieces.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1577/23493909033_b444ca0787_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This set occurred at the watershed from fully brick-built to the more modern studless building techniques. There are several parts unique to this set as well as a few parts that continue to be found in sets over 20 years later.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As stated above, the build is divided into 36 steps. By step 20 the sub-chassis is complete along with the gearbox and steering system.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1574/23489258244_3f212a158b_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>As this model is four-wheel drive, there are three <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/6573"">differentials</a>.</p>

<p>The set uses <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/2907"">Technic balls</a> as CV joints in the <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/2999"">steering wheel hubs</a>. This is a close up photo&nbsp;of the front steering and suspension assembly. As 5M axles&nbsp;did not appear until 1998, this set has joined a 3M and 2M axle&nbsp;on each of the four drive shafts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5749/24091422056_1bb62bc693_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This set uses a chain drive to connect the V8 engine onto the drive train. The steering pinion&nbsp;axle is threaded through the chain. The front steering turns twice as far as the rear by using a 16 tooth pinion at the front and an eight tooth pinion at the rear.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5785/24009398482_2db22cb62b_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>By step 29 the V8 engine is assembled and attached, the steering wheel and Hand of God steering is connected,&nbsp;and the dash board is built complete with dipping head lights.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5684/24091298196_2990982f69_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The standout feature of this set which has not been matched on any other Technic set is the ease in which the gears&nbsp;can be changed. This is achieved&nbsp;by the use of a&nbsp;<a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/6543"">stick shift plate</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/6549"">Technic stick shift</a>. These two parts have only been seen in this set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1566/24091297176_c733cdc4b8_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/653902"">driving ring</a>&nbsp;or synchroniser and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4113804"">axle connector</a>&nbsp;first appeared in 1993, in set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8824-1/Hovercraft"">8824 Hovercraft</a>; however, this is the first Technic set to use these parts in a functioning gear box.</p>

<p>Here is a close up photo of the V8 engine, rear suspension and Hand of God steering wheel</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1619/23490564313_abb15dcb35_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>A&nbsp;close up photo of the front&nbsp;suspension. This set uses <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/4265b"">toothed half bushes</a> throughout.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1659/24034758601_dff98b77d0_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There are a few occasions where the build requires a small amount of force to flex and connect components. Today this would likely be called <em>illegal</em>.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is finished off with black Technic beams with a sandwich of black and&nbsp;yellow plates that&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the trim. The shape is achieved by the generous use <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/73983"">black hinge plates</a>. The entire shaped body is made using these studded brick pieces.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1467/24009276942_e930d95b26_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The rear hatch lifts up to reveal the engine. There is Technic livery with 4x4x4; four wheels with four wheel drive and four wheel steering.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5829/23749579439_8018fe61ba_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There were several cars in the 1990s that had this configuration; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Celica"">Toyota Celica</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Alcyone_SVX"">Subaru Alcyone</a>&nbsp;are two examples.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The LEGO Technic designers included a whole lot of engineering into this set and, as such, the set holds a position of awe amongst&nbsp;Technic&nbsp;AFOL enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions do not include any indication for adding a motor although there is plenty of room to add a modern Power Functions M Motor next to the central differential. There is quite a lot of torque&nbsp;between the V8 engine and the wheels so maybe this is why motorisation was not considered.</p>

<p>The suspension is rather stiff but this is handled well by the extremely&nbsp;rigid&nbsp;brick-built&nbsp;chassis.</p>

<p>I like the fact that the Hand of God steering also operates the principle steering wheel.</p>

<p>Shifting gears is so smooth that it is a shame that LEGO have not used the unique shifter parts in any other set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The speedo&nbsp;for the A model indicates a speed of 147 km/h (91 mph)&nbsp;which is performance you would expect from a sleek sports car.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5744/24013394202_7acff45351_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 603px;"" /></p>

<p>This set does reach the upper limit of design possibilities using the traditional brick-built techniques. I can see why Technic evolved within the next few years to include lift arms, panels and flexible hoses.</p>

<p>This set is still available at quite reasonable prices and should be included in any serious Technic enthusiast&#39;s collection.</p>
