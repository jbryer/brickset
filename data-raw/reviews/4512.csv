This is what an _idea_ book should be like; full of ideas. Not every model you see comes with full instructions. Some of the models you actually have to figure out yourself! Unfortunately that fun is lost on modern parents and children so now Lego can no longer sell sets with pictures of models that aren't explained in every detail.</p><p>So what are those great models and ideas in this book? There are some (now) traditional Technic models; a car chassis to turn into a Jeep or a truck, a bridge, a crane and a helicopter. But there are also some very original models. There's a pullback motor with elastic bands, a robot dog and a clock.The highlight is a programmable crane. Yes, programmable in 1980, 20 years before Mindstorms. There are full instructions for the crane and then some pictures that suggest you can use the same principle to create a programmable plotter.Yes, the models look basic compared to todays sets but remember Technic was only 3 years old and the range of parts was very limited. <br></p><p>This book has 100 pages of great ideas for Technic that are still inspiring today.Get a copy if you can! (or start by downloading the scans from Peeron...) </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
