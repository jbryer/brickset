I really bought it for the 6 wheeled beast inside, I even bought extra wheels because i only owned 4 at the time.
The models really had me going and looking over them now makes me want to build some(especially the 6 wheeled truck)
This book is a definate A+++++ and if you can find one, go get it!!!

My book looks in better shape than your picture does, so mayby I can send a photo.

It was made with the rare 20X30 wheels which you could only get with the 8848 and the 8847 (later one wasnt sold in germany, but i own it and i still wonder how i got it). The idea books contained lots of building techniques and great ideas, i even took it and &#180;read&#180; the instructions carefully some time ago. This is really a must-have for the technic fan.

"Crazy_Chris","2012-07-30T19:35:26.027Z","Very good Technic Idea Book","When I was a child, I owned nearly all smaller technic sets that were released during the 80ies. And someday, I received this idea book as a gift. Don't know if it has been Christmas or my birthday.<br><br>It offers lots of building instructions for nice models, in detail:<br><br>pages 6-9: Sportscar<br>Nice little car. With steering and mid-engine. No more features, but it really looks nice. I also used it as a base for tuning and mods: wide base tires, crazy wings, all the 80ies stuff.<br><br>pages 10-15: Buggy with trailer and motobike<br>Well, the buggy looks.... strange. But the trailer adds playability, and the motobike is great: steering and suspension, quite a little bit extraordinary at that time.<br><br>pages 16-19: Fire truck<br>To be honest, I never was interested in building this little fire truck.<br><br>pages 20-27: Tow truck<br>This might be the result when you're mixing 8846 and 8848. Nothing really special, but fun to build and play with.<br><br>pages 28-37: Six-wheeled monster<br>Unfortunately, I never had enough bricks to build this ""car"". Not even enough to come close to it. Maybe I'll visit Bricklink and try again...<br><br>pages 55-61: Ferry with pneumatic system<br>Looks odd, but works fine. I guess TLC wanted to push the Pneumatic system, which was very new in 1984.<br><br>pages 62-71: Sportscar with pneumatic wing doors<br>Looks odd, too. But a great model that shows the capabilities of the pneumatic system beyond the standard use cases. I really liked that car.<br><br>pages 72-81: Mobile repair lift with pneumatic system<br>Another model that shows how to use the Pneumatic system. Nice build, nice to play with.<br><br>pages 82-89: Wheel loader<br>Looks straightforward, but contains very interesting building techniques. Just have a look at it, and you'll see what I mean. Highly recommended !<br><br>pages 90-95: small motorized plane<br>Few features, but looks pretty good.<br><br>pages 100-103: Ropeway<br>My dad wanted to build it, so he did. Unfortunately, the rope he had chosen was too weak. So it crashed down, and I never wanted to build it again...<br><br>pages 104-107: Robotic style gripper arm<br>Interesting design and build. But I never managed to grab things for real.<br><br>pages 108-109: Small drawbrigde for minifigs<br>Nice idea - technic meets town.<br><br>Summary:<br>Quite as good as 8888. Shows lots of small and medium-sized models. Get it, you won't regret it.<br>",TRUE,4,1,5,4,5
"LucyC","2015-02-18T12:42:00.377Z","Wonderful Book","<p>Someone gave me this many years ago as they knew that I had lots of Lego Technic, &nbsp;the instructions were in the standard Lego format so the models were all easy to build even if some were on the simple side, &nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;Technic has now gone studless and IMHO lost a lot of creativity that you got with the old style sets.</p>

<p>The book has some photos of a (large) 6 wheeled truck in the middle, I spent hours trying to work out how it was put together, it was a shame they didn&#39;t include the instructions or even a hint on how it went together.</p>
