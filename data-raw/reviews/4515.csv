"TechnicNick","2011-06-03T08:26:40.097Z","There Were Four Technic Idea Books; Three Of Them Were Great","This one isn't. After the technical wonders displayed in 8888 and 8889, this comes as a crushing disappointment. Barely half the size of the others, this slender volume is almost entirely full of fairly uninspired vehicles for the purpose of ferrying around those poseable Technic figures that Lego did for a while.<div><br></div><div>There are exceptions. One is a fairly neat 'walking' machine, although this idea was explored in the earlier books, and there is a crane wherein our poseable friends are nowhere to be seen. Again, there are bigger and better cranes in the other books.</div><div><br></div><div>There is no more inspiration to be found here than you used to get in the outer ideas pages of the regular instructions for the early sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'd give this one a miss, then. But do not miss 8888, 8889 and 8891 - these are proper idea books with *drum roll* ideas in them...</div>",TRUE,2,1,2,3,3
"Crazy_Chris","2012-08-07T17:48:49.933Z","Different approach, not bad at all.","At first, I'd like to say something about the predecessors 88<b>88</b> and 88<b>89</b>: Both are great idea books, they show great models and offer good ideas. But there is one issue that really annoys me: Although I own(ed) most of the technic sets (and lots of additional town and space sets, too) of that early era, I was only able to build about half of the models shown in 88<b>88</b> and 88<b>89</b>. To build each model, it seems as if it is necessary to own the entire line-up released in those years. Today, I am able to buy all missing parts and sets, but back in the 80ies, my parents were not (I guess, like many other parents, too).<br><br>88<b>90</b> is different: It shows less models than 8888 and 8889, and the models are also less complex.<br>No doubt: the highlight of this book is the walker, which can be built combining the sets 8660+8700+8852. It walks slowly, but it works fine, and it looks pretty good.<br>I also like the hangar, the F1 pitstop and the truck.<br>To build the trike, you only need set 8842. So, it is a kind of ""C"" model of that set. But imho, it looks way better than the official ""B"" model of set 8842.<br><br>As an additional bonus, the last page of 8890 shows which sets are needed to build each model shown in the book. This is quite helpful, I really wish Lego would have provided this information for 8888, 8889 and 8891, too.<br><br>Summary: Compared to all other technic idea books, this one isn't fancy at all. But it shows what can be built, even if you own only a limited number of sets.<br>",TRUE,4,1,3,4,4
