"Loganwan","2008-02-29T14:50:54.217Z","Eh.","Not the best set.  It has a nice strong motor, but it is rather large and cumbersome.  If you have ever played with the vehicles from the early 80s, then you know they were fairly small.  The motor by itself was as large as a car, so did not really make for a great addition to the early Lego sets.  The wheels on the base were attached and could not be removed.  That caused a builder to be majorly limited in building possibilities.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Against all odds, the size and the colour did inspire me once to try and build a massive dump-truck for my lego town. This effort left me with an ludicrously fast running dumper and me running just as fast out of ideas.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"fishmanash","2014-02-27T06:27:39.92Z","An old favourite for my first review","<p>As a child growing up in the 1980s, I had a huge collection&nbsp;of random&nbsp;bricks and pieces, the hugest and most random piece&nbsp;was this yellow windup motor. more than any other piece this one fueled my imagination, it was a tank, a futuristic people carrier, caravan attached&nbsp;to a car, a parade float, a robotic moving house and many more insane things.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I remember getting this as new, the box was typical of its time and very well presented.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>not a lot to this set, just a big yellow box housing a windup motor, some red wheels, on the plus side you did get two keys to wind it&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As other reviews have pointed out, the motor is much bigger than the scale of regular lego&nbsp;cars, &nbsp; this can affect playability, if you are concerned about keeping models to scale.If you are willing to look past the size issue there is a lot to recommend this piece, especially&nbsp;for the younger builder.</p>

<p>Firstly, due to the size this is very durable and will stand up to the harshest play.</p>

<p>Secondly, the motor is extremely&nbsp;fast, meaning your models will positively&nbsp;fly around the living room.</p>

<p>As you will probable have guessed&nbsp;by now, I have a real soft spot for this big yellow lump of plastic, for all its faults the simplicity&nbsp;of this piece makes it perfect for developing the imagination of young builders.</p>
