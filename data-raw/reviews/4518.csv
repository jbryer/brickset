Nobody has reviewed this set? All to busy with 928!!!!
This is one of my first space sets and it gave me lots of fun. It is simple but screams classic space!!! Mayby I own the only copy of this classic, gotta be worth something...

I'm sure I'll be proven wrong, so give this classic its due.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

That's when you remeber how much you played with it, it's just absolutely fantastic. I can recall times I used to play entire Saturday afternoons with just this spaceset. The engines, and gun are brilliant. The computer was the main part of the instruments of my own creations for nearly a decade... ",FALSE,5,5,4,5,5

<p>I can&#39;t remember why I was so excited to get this set - either it was my first white space-minifig, or because it had room to seat two astronauts, or the awesome-looking jet engines doubling as landing skids, or the (re)movable sensor/gun! But I definitely remember this as being one set I really wanted.</p>

<p>This set most definitely got swooshed around a lot and despite being so simple by todays standards offered a lot of playability.</p>

<p>Left the value-for-money at default since I have absolutely no idea how much it cost back in the day..</p>

<p>NB: It came with a standard classic-Space-Logo printed minifig, not a plain white one as per the description here.</p>
