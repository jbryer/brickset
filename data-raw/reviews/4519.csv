"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-26T10:25:21Z","One of my favorite!","This is one of my favorite sets -- maybe my favorite Classic Space set! Simple but realistic, nice with its rare antenna &quot;shields&quot;, its back radar and the small yellow windows. When i was child, I have ever dreamt about it (but I bought it only many years later), because this is one of the few (three???) space sets using white clear parts. Then, the antenna uses a Technic part too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-17T02:39:35Z","One of my favourites too! ","Another expensive (very) of classic space, this is still a nice set.  I just had to buy it because of the 2 clear &quot;shields&quot; though!  

I never had this set as a child either and feel my childhood suffered for it!!!!! The clear shields in this set are among the best lego pieces ever created! I think it's a nice cheap mobile control centre too.  Another greater trailer vehicle. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-24T00:41:42Z","Great for its time","I had this set as a child. I really liked the gray bricks in this set, although there were only a few. It was the first time I ever saw them. Sadly, the clear round shields broke very easily. I think they broke pretty early on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-15T19:54:31Z","My First Lego Space Set","I was about ten years old when a family friend bought his for me. It was my first experience of the newer, Space range of Lego, and I was thrilled. The doors at the back of the vehicle opened to reveal a computer console. Happy days!

Who didn't use the clear scanner dishes as 'ray guns'?!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"mwerle","2022-07-06T07:20:52.527Z","Awesome little set","<p>I can&#39;t recall thinking anything particularly special about this set when I got it way back in the day (probably for a birthday or Christmas), but looking back on it it is one of the better classic LEGO Space sets!</p>

<p>The build is, typically for the time, rather basic, consisting mostly of just plates and bricks.&nbsp; But it does include many movable parts and some unique parts, mostly the elements making up the rotating antennae on the top.</p>

<p>Playability is very good as the trailer can be decoupled, allowing for radar triangulation (of course, back when I was a kid, I had no idea what this is..). The rear doors open to a small electronic workstation, and both the trailer and rooftop antennae are movable.</p>

<p>It matches the style of the era very well.</p>
