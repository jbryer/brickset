It's small, it's simple, very robust, without any impossible special pieces, and can easily serve as a model for another five to ten racers in anyone's collection.

Though it is stated here, the model was NOT a USA exclusive, as the Dutch retailer 'Intertoys' sold this model as an exclusive as well.  That's where I got mine :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-07T13:51:15.437Z","Another Fun Little Car","This car, like many of the other little cars, was very small, simple and inexpensive.  However, when you put several of them in the same place, your imagination could really take off and you could have tons of fun with fast-paced racing (and crashing) action!  

I feel like you could never have too many of these little cars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I would choose red instead of white, but it would be too perfect. Overall, this is great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-18T16:35:57.893Z","Victory Racer","<p>I was trying at one point to collect up a bunch of little race cars to build a Race Track as at the time, the huge Victory Race Lap set was out of my league and a shattered dream when it was no longer available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a very good little model. I remember taking other pieces and being able to make duplicates of various colors off this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike another reviewer, I'd have gone for black, not red for the minifigure. But white is alright and he has one of the early new helmets with visor that was quickly becoming a rage of Space minis and Town sets to replace an older, simpler helmet that could easily crack and break at the chin on a mini.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4

<p>While in no way groundbreaking, given that LEGO has always attracted the attention of many a young gear-head&nbsp;(this reviewer included), this set is an enjoyable enough build, and the race car quickly takes shape after only a few steps, which never ceases to entertain, although for me, this set was always inferior to 1461: Turbo Racer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Most of the parts included here (with the exception of the numbered brick in front) were readily available elsewhere, but there is something endearing about the Minifig driver&#39;s totally 80&#39;s white driving suit!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>An excellent addition to the inevitable LEGO Grand Prix that was seemingly always running in your town.</p>
