No fuzzz with batteries, it always runs and has quite a nice bit of torque. The base is perfect, so if you don&#180;t care that it hasn&#180;t got train wheels, you can use it in combination with tracks. Although I don&#180;t know how it will react to points ;-)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Nevertheless I'm happy to own one and this set might still be good for young kids to learn to build first moving objects that go at a save pace. The modern motors a more radical in this manner.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-25T06:38:43.32Z","Demolisher Wagon","<p>I love the &#39;Lame Mule&#39; review here as it lists two of the reasons why I feel this motor was good; slow, and noisy.....</p>

<p><b>Clockwork Carnage</b><br />
This is one of the best and longest working clockwork toys we owned so well done to TLG for a quality clockwork motor, the fat red key making a satisfying winding before you let it go. I would concede that the brick hump in the middle was indeed frustrating to build around and not many great vehicles came out of this set that scored highly for aesthetics!<br />
<br />
Nonetheless this wonderfully noisy wagon when built up in to some kind of demolition vehicle would slowly plough through almost anything ahead at&nbsp;an appreciably slowish speed, increasing anticipation. If you loosely built buildings with poor brick joins not pressed together properly, it would often take out a small building before stalling in the carnage strewn rubble. Any loose things would otherwise be pushed aside or shovelled together neatly - a snow plough is a definite possibility here. I can not remember sadly what gradient of hill it could cope with and must check one day but down slopes obviously just helped.<br />
<br />
An old and ugly bit of fun, especially for imaginatively destructive or idle hands.</p>
