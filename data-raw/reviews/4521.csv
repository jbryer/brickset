In those days I think I was too young even for pocket money, but I got this set anyway and it was great.  I can still remember having an original box! This set is the perfect example of how lego rockets and trailers should be made! 

This set is an expensive find, but I recommend it to anyone who wants a quality lego space set with fantastic play value for it's size.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"seahawkeye","2008-07-01T08:59:32.45Z","To launch or not to launch","For youngsters used to the high-tech gadgetry of the last thirty years of Space Lego, this set probably looks impossibly quaint. Back in the day when a small Apollo-like rocket still seemed exotic, this set was awesome. 

The driver and the rocket technician form a great duo. The spinning control seat has the perfect feel, and the rocket itself is somehow in perfect proportion. The payload is simple but plausible, and the unit as a whole looks like something you WANT to work on (I’d prefer it to my current office!). 

It’s great flaw is obvious: you need to break the rocket off the transporter if you want to ‘launch’ it. Simple solution – don’t launch it. This is such a stunning little set that the playability comes in the fantasy.

<p>Have you ever played with the vintage LEGO Space set or sometimes called classic LEGO Space? This theme is the first outer space theme from the LEGO Group that focused on outer space. This theme was released in 1978.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The LEGO Space theme has various sub themes and even the sets released in the 90th era looks more awesome. But why I chose classic set? This is because I was born in 1979, and I feel that I should at least own a set that as old as myself. Thus, this LEGO 897 - Mobile Rocket Launcher is one of the 3 space sets released in 1979 that I own. The other are <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/918-1/One-Man-Space-Ship"">918</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/891-1/Two-Seater-Space-Scooter"">891</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this set is more a Mobile Satellite Launcher since there is a satellite component that we can attach on the upper end of the rocket. This set is composed of two main vehicles. The first one is the control vehicle with radar dish and computer system that drag around the rocket launching platform.</p>

<p>When the rocket is ready for launch to the outer space, the control vehicle will detach itself from the launching platform and move away to avoid the rocket blast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set come with two classic Space minifigures. These classic astronaut-like minifigures are in red and white colours. Since I bought this as a second-hand set, the golden moon logo on both torsos have faded out. These two minifigures probably are the operators of the mobile satellite launcher. The control panel part on this set is printed and not using sticker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think both adult and children will enjoy playing with this set. I even still feel nostalgic with this set and I sometimes play together with my son who also enjoys playing with this classic Space set.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is a very quick build but you have to immerse yourself into it since you are building a classic piece! Don&#39;t speed build it if you can get this set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Well, this set is only consists of around 76 pieces. But I have to say with this little parts, the mobile rocket launcher looks realistic enough.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>This set is exciting! You can play it along with other space sets, or it can blend into your city diorama especially if you have the Space shuttle sets around. If you don&#39;t have either of those, then this set can be played by itself. You can use your imagination that these two explorers were away from their remote base in frontier planet and preparing to launch satellite for communication with Earth or other planets. The possibility is limitless when you use your own imagination. Then after playing with it, you can put it into display.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Well, I do not know how much the price of this set when it was released on 1979. I bought it as a used set and I am okay with the price I paid since it is a vintage set. Beside the fading space logos and the white parts on the minifigures along with faded parts on the grey parts, I still believe the price that I paid is acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>I agree with the other reviewer that there is a design flaw on this set. We need to break the rocket apart if we plan to &quot;launch&quot; it into space since there is a part in the middle of the entire rocket body that connect to the mobile platform. So you have to detach the rocket parts and reattach them again to launch the rocket.</p>
