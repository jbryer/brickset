"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-30T18:30:07Z","Very Collectable","In my opinion, 918, the littlest of the three original LL 92x ships (along with 924 and 928, the first &quot;LEGOLAND Space&quot; themed spaceships) is without doubt one of the most collectable LEGO sets of all time.  For a lot of Space collectors, and LEGO collectors in general, it is the prized set of their collection, or at the top of the list of sets they would like to add to their collection.  As a collector of LEGO, I judge by a few factors what makes a set collectable - this set has several factors (besides desirability) which make it very collectable:

1 - Part of a &quot;series&quot; that is very popular (as a key set in the first wave of LEGOLAND Space theme sets, this set is collectable and sought after for that reason alone).

2 - Elusive parts.  Most sets consist of parts that are not unique, while some of the most desired and hardest to find (complete) sets contain unique parts which were only found in only one set ever... From the Castle theme, 6011 had a unique &quot;grey&quot; chest, 6023 had a unique &quot;white&quot; maiden's hat, 6067 had unique red walls and a unique flag, 6041 had a unique colored goblet and a unique colored sword).  This set has a unique &quot;elusive dashboard&quot; piece that was only released in this set and never in any other, to the best of my knowledge.  It is also the only set that contained blue 1x4 bricks with &quot;LL918&quot; printed on the side.

3 - Difficulty of finding a box.  For collectors looking for an entire collection including the wonderful boxes and their great art, the box from this set has proven to be one of the most difficult LEGOLAND boxes to find.  For those collecting MISB (mint in sealed box - unopened, new) sets, there just aren't enough of these in the world to go around, thus you can expect the price to be pretty crazy IF you manage to locate one.  Almost forgot to mention, finding a complete loose (unboxed) version of this set with genuine instructions (not scans or photocopies) is also very, very uncommon - so the instructions are quite rare, as well.

4 - Limited release.  This set was not sold in the United States.  LL918's sister ships LL924 (set #924) and LL928 (set #928) were offered in the United States as sets 487 (Space Cruiser) and 497 (Galaxy Explorer).  Of the 4 LEGOLAND Castle theme sets that I mentioned with unique pieces, 3 of those (6011, 6023, 6067) were also not offered in stores in the US (though they were sold, in very small numbers, through LEGO Shop at Home catalogs) and are therefore quite a bit more difficult, at least for US collectors, to find.

With all that said, this set has quite a few collectablity factors summed up as rarity, uniqueness of parts and limited availability.  The most important factor of course is desirability...

Modelwise, this set is very simple and very small.  Aside from the unique pieces, all of the pieces are &quot;compatible&quot; with the other LEGOLAND themes (of that time and today!), which I count as a plus, since LEGO, in my mind, is supposed to be unlimited in building possibilities.  Unfortunately, LEGO just is not that way anymore with so many theme-specific pieces being made for all the various themes.

The model looks good, like a small one-man space ship, and it doesn't break up upon re-entry like the grand &quot;Galaxy Explorer&quot; which falls apart easily.  While 928 (497) Galaxy Explorer is a flagship set, and is a truly great set in nearly every way, it is not nearly as rare or hard to find as 918, and doesn't have the uniqueness of parts, and in my humble opinion, is less realistic in appearance than 918.

For those (probably Americans) who &quot;thought they had all the earliest Space sets&quot; and then see this one, it will make a great addition to their already very nice collections.  If you just like &quot;knowing you have them all&quot; then this set is a good one to have, and if you like to display your models then 918 is certainly a great addition to the 924 and 928 display...

In 1999, I spent a couple days rebuilding all these classic sets and covered the dining room table and had just as much fun, I guess, as I did when I was 8 doing the same thing.  They really did look cool!  Unfortunately, I sold most of those sets, thinking I could re-acquire them later in life when finances are better (aye, to dream, and still dreaming haha) yet I didn't sell my boxed 918, as it had been extremely hard to find.  That doesn't seem to have changed.

For these reasons, this set is very desirable, in my opinion, for any Classic Space collector, self included, and, in conclusion, the rarity factors along with the desirability make this an extremely collectable set.  And the going price seems to substantiate my opinion.  Personally, I think it's the #1 space set in terms of collectability, followed closely by 1593.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-15T18:22:10Z","A timeless classic","I always wanted this set when I was a kid but it wasn't until recently that I finally acquired one.
To make up for this gap in my childhood fleet I built my own variation which was a better design (in my opinion!)
Now my own variant and the original can sit side by side!

This must be one of the easiest spacecraft to pilot ever, as it can be operated by just 5 knobs from a domestic cooker!!!! Other craft in the series needed computers and stuff to control them but little old LL918 would fly quite happily on Gas Mark 5!
For your travelling spaceman, luggage stowage is quite limited with only 2 small cargo doors, but what do you expect with the spacecraft version of the sporty coupe?
While the LL918 can rocket along in the vacuum of space without worry, atmospheric performance is hampered by poor aerodynamics below the wing-line.
Access to the cockpit is through the gullwing-style roof panel so boarding is slightly tricky for the shorter minifig.
Finally, the large single engine is more than enough to power such a small spacecraft, and cornering in those tricky asteroid fields is brought about by 2 sets of directional thrusters.

It holds a special spot in my collection as it was obviously the inspiration for the great Galaxy Explorer (set 928) which is still one of my favourite sets of all time.  It's also one of the more rare space lego sets. Finding one in good condition with original box and instructions will cost you lots.

"Paul_Baulch","2007-09-12T08:23:28.42Z","Perfection in a LEGO spaceship","This spaceship sports the excellent Classic Space colour scheme, and has a visual design that is about as close to perfect as I can imagine for a LEGO spaceship.
For a start, it's visually balanced, having structure which extends about as far underneath the wing surface as it does above, unlike its larger cousins 924 and 928 which have am inferior &quot;stuff plonked on top of the wing&quot; look to them, or later sets which would feature spindly wings, struts or oversized tails or weapons.
Secondly, it displays a wonderful minimalism in that all the components are there to perform some reasonably obvious function, and are placed in aesthetically pleasing spots. Lastly, it's an incredibly efficient design, providing a compact assortment of internal features while maintaining a sleekness of exterior.

Perfection.

<p>These set has four printed parts on it. The author is lucky to get this set with intact printed parts. Usually after 40 years have passed, the printed graphic will fade away. Unfortunately, the golden colour on the planet image located on the spaceman minifigure chest has faded. Now the author started to understand why some AFOL dislike stickers on LEGO sets.
