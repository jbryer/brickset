<p>It has all the parts of a great Classic Space set:</p>
<p>The buggy, the rocket, the base with all the computers, moving parts, 3 minifigures, Blue, gray and transparent yellow color scheme.</p>
<p>The construction is simple but amazing, I had fun building the set.</p>
<p>I am in the process of getting all the Classic Space set and this was a great addition</p>

<p>Not only is there the base, but also a rocket launcher with satellite and a refuelling truck with a detachable trailer. The radar dish on the roof was the first one with full rotation and elevation capability, although it did tend to snag on the antenna if you were pointing it straight up.</p>

<p>The build is typical for the era - mostly just stacking of plates and bricks. Simple, but effective, leading to a nice solid build. Unique is the use of the rubber hoses which adds significantly to the look of the base, and the playability of the refuelling trailer, although the trailers&#39; two hoses don&#39;t really have anywhere to stow them, just tucking them into a gap when not attached to the base, which is a little disappointing. Nowadays the build would probably add a technic brick with a hole for this purpose.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t give it 5/5 for playability because attaching and detaching the refuelling hoses was fiddly and I was always worried they would break or tear when pulling them off, and the rocket keeps breaking apart when you launch it - a more modern build would use one or more technic rods down the centre of it I&#39;m sure to hold it together, as later rockets in the series did.</p>

<p>Apart from those few minor niggles, it is a really great set though and shines as a centerpiece. It is complemented very well by 6970 &quot;Beta Command Base&quot; which actually has an image of the rocket on the launchpad on its giant screen inside the base.</p>
