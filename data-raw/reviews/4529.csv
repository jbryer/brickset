"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-01T11:13:45Z","Classic Space","The 924 is classic space at it's best! The set contains a medium-sized space transporter, a fork lift truck with cargo and two astronauts. The space ship is actuated by two large main engines and equipped with a set of three directional thrusters on each side. All in all 155 pieces and even the alternative models on the back side of the box are very good. Along with the small 918 and the large 928 it builds the first generation fleet of classic space and was only available till 1980. The first sets in 1979 even contained stickers to apply the space logo on the mini figure torsos. Despite the fact that the original price was only US$10 you really have to pay a lot of money to get a sealed set today if you are able to locate one! No question it is worth a lot of money...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set still had plenty to offer and I loved the forklift.  This just made it into my top 10.  Probably beacuse it looked so much like 928.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"speed27","2009-06-21T06:32:04.123Z","918, 924 & 928 cleared for take off!!","as a kid i got 918 and 928 for my birthday and christmas. by the time the next birthday came around 924 was no longer avaliable! so 26 years later i managed to get my hands on one and my classic space set was complete. when you line the 3 of them up they are impressive. add in the bases of the time and hours of play are possible.
the ship follows the 918 and 928 built style with the forklift adding to the great land vehicles of the time. (also fits into the back of 928!)the rear section opens and the white container goes inside. it is also great for modifying to use as a hauler to carry around the back of set 6927 (browse the web and you will find them).
if you have one of these hold on to it for dear life as they are getting hard to find and expensive! another set that should be rereleased",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2012-11-08T02:49:15.15Z","One of the best sets ever made","Together with 375 and 928, this set encapsulates for me the joy of getting, building and playing with Lego. &nbsp;Although it's over 30 years ago, I can still vividly remember the crisp, clear drawings in the instructions and the excitement as the grey wing plates came together to form the shape of the ship. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The finished spacecraft is eminently ""swooshable"" and the opening canopy and swinging cargo doors are as fun to play with now as they were back in 1979. The light grey forklift is also a great feature and, if memory serves, is the only forklift to be included in the space line. &nbsp;This set also has the distinction of being the only ""real"" set to feature in the famous 6000 ideas book. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Wherever I have lived over the past three decades, and however much of my collection was consigned to storage, this ship has always held a place of honour on top of a wardrobe or cupboard in my room. There is something about these early Space sets that captures the thrill and adventure of the early space program - a feeling that humanity could go anywhere and do anything; an optimism that seems now to be lost. &nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div><div>An all-time effort by Lego and a more than worthy addition to any collection!</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"doe","2014-09-05T05:51:50.377Z","my first LEGO set","<p>This is not my first LEGO set, but probably the first I remember getting for christmas&nbsp;1979 or was it 1978? The excitement of getting Space Minifigs! I instantley and forever fell in love with LEGO and this set in particular.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Back in the days boxes used to have alternate models displayed on the back of the box. Sometimes even as great as the original model, which gives the boxes from the classic space line an added value. The instructions did not feature a preview on the next needed parts for each step. They made you think!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Grey wings! For me the most important part in this set. And all logos, etc. printed on the bricks, no stickers at all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Classic Space minifigs&nbsp;can&#39;t be replaced by anything else. The old classic space helmet looks so much better than the revised new version.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For a six year old and his first set? Quite a challenge but exciting and fun!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The shwooshability&nbsp;is 10 out of 10!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s my favourite set of the classic space line. A space theme of pure explorers. No Aliens needed, just some excavators collecting moon rocks. Still a source of unlimited imagination and playability.&nbsp;</p>

"mwerle","2022-07-19T14:49:47.1Z","Finally fulfilled my childhood dream of owning this set!","<p>As a kid I got the 918 and, eventually, the 928. My best friend had the 924, and even though I had the 928, I was always a little bit jealous of the little forklift&nbsp; truck that came with this ship.</p>

<p>I just bought this set off eBay and even though it&#39;s definitely in the &quot;well played&quot; category, it&#39;s awesome! Even though I built and played with all the classic space lego I still managed to stuff up the build and had to redo part of it. The instructions (probably not helped by the fact I didn&#39;t get the paper ones but only digital) tend to combine multiple steps into one which can be a bit tricky when grey plates are stacked on top of grey plates..</p>

<p>The parts are pretty much standard stuff for the time, the &quot;special&quot; bricks being the wings, printed parts, and clear cockpit slopes. But as they are all very generic &quot;classic space&quot; bricks, all the parts are easily repurposed for MOCs.</p>

<p>Finished, it&#39;s pretty much everything I remember from childhood - decent size, cargo hold with the little forklift and cargo, and two minifigs with accessories. It would be really nice if there were a couple more cargo pieces included... but that&#39;s something which can be easily built with some spare bricks.</p>

<p>The forklift does tend to be a bit front-heavy with cargo loaded so I&#39;m thinking to extend it slightly with an angled slope piece as a counter-weight.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t wait to get back &quot;home&quot; and finally see it next to my other ships..</p>

<p>As for &quot;value for money&quot;, well, back in the day it was probably great value, these days, not so much!</p>
