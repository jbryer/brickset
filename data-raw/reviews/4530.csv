"speed27","2009-06-21T06:44:20.403Z","25 years in the waiting","another set that i wanted as a kid and just missed out on. this base was replaced by the beta 1 base which is what i got as a kid. after missing out on getting a boxed version on ebay i turned to the web and bought one instead. 
it is a great base with the ultra rare printed 6x6 panel and two ground vehicles. when you put it next to rocket launch pad and the beta 1 base you end up with hours of play. throw in the 928 galaxy explorer (as well as 918 and 924) and many a rainy school holiday can be drifted away.
the cool thing about this set is that it has two of the grey antenna as well as the radar dishes. this set can be made on the cheap if you have the bricks and you happen to come across the printed brick on ebay. another of those sets you should never let go of and if its at you parents place dont trust them not to sell it!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

And I have to say, it may have been 40 years, but this command centre still stands the test of time.</p>

<p>Yes, it looks blocky, simple, uniform in color, a tad boring maybe by today&#39;s standard, but if you look past all that, what you get is a true command centre (6 computers!!) and a room with a view: a stunning printed piece that makes the entire set come alive. Just look at that astronaut floating in complete nothingness, with his wrench, on his way to that satellite....wonderfull!!</p>

<p>The 4 astronauts are your typical vintage LEGO spacemen. Mine came with the stickered torso&#39;s, which&nbsp;have a special place in my heart. The red and white figs&nbsp;stand&nbsp;out to the blue and grey&nbsp;and are a welcoming addition of color.</p>

<p>As a stand-alone set, it is however a bit lacking: there are swirling dishes, a bunch of computers, 2 antenna&#39;s, but only two very small rovers to accompany all this technology. Swapping those rovers with a medium-sized spacecraft, would have lifted this set up tot another level: the level of perfection.</p>

<p>If you really want to make the most out of this set you have to combine it with 918, 924 or 928. LEGO realized this also, showing the set at the back of the instructions, combined with other classic space sets like 929 and 918, to provide maximum playability</p>

<p>so, to wrap things up:</p>

<p>PRO:<br />
-beautiful printed pieces (windowpane)<br />
-beautiful printed pieces (computers)<br />
-beautiful printed pieces (classic space-logo bricks)</p>

<p>CONS:<br />
-a bit spars<br />
-needs other sets to get the most out of it.</p>
