"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-18T11:59:09Z","Classic Space Perfection","Although one of the first classic space sets, this is undoubtedly one of, if not the, best. The large number of generic pieces allowed almost unlimited building opportunities and certainly kept me amused for many years. This set does actually contain lots of specialised pieces  (well they were certainly classed as that in 1979 when the set came out) but over time even the most specialised bits become common.

A fantastic set that has lost none of its playability in the quarter of a century since its first release.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-10T16:12:34Z","The ultimate classic!!!","I got this set for christmas when I was about 10 and was instantly hooked on the classic space theme. It was one of the biggest kits available at the time of release and was an excellent design. Solidly constructed, it easily outshone other spacecraft kits which were released later as they maybe looked better but had a much more flimsy build.
The kit is the largest in a series of 3 similar spacecraft and owning the whole fleet was only a distant dream for me as a boy!

Kitted out with 7 rocket engines and 2 thrusters, and with a beautifully streamlined shape, the rear doors hinge open and a ramp can be lowered to allow loading of the included space buggy. A separate cockpit has ample room to accomodate the pilots, this forward cockpit also has a roof which opens for access and pilot boarding.
The kit comes with landing pad and crater plate upon which is mounted a small control station.

A couple of years ago I bought this kit once again and have since been re-living my childhood! It is still as exciting and playable as before, but in truth I am waiting for LEGO to re-release the kit as a LEGO Legend, so I can own a brand-new spacecreaft rather than a second-hand one.

In my opinion - the best LEGO kit ever!

The galaxy explorer wasn't the first lego set that I owned as a child but it was the one set that, for me, took playing with lego to a whole new level. This set I'm sure played a huge part in the development of my imagination as a child and is one of those toys that I will never forget.  

Any child of the 70's who didn't have a galaxy explorer missed out on hours upon hours of fun exploring the stars and planets.  Today, I still enjoying taking it apart and building new variations.  

I hope this set continues to be a favourite toy for generations to come in my family.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-28T15:32:53Z","The heart of classic space! ","This set sets standards in Lego that no other set since has matched.  

The design might not be to everyone's liking, but it's very good! Very memorable for most people like myself who were lucky to own it over 20 years ago.

The minifigures are great too! What other lego figures did lego collectors collect multiples of as a child? Not only are the logos a fantastic sign, but they have nice shiney gold on them! That was rare for figures in those days.

The parts in the set are fantastic! Those 2x2 gray stand bricks are now very expensive, and I just love the cone bricks! The gray radar dish is nice too.  

The versatility of this set as a set made for minifigures is unparalleled!!  Let's face it, this set is a paragon of lego sets!!!  How many other lego sets have as many alternative designs on the box?!! I can think of 1 or 2, like the 912 set from 1976, but those designs are more like models than designs to play with lego figures.  There are so many nice designs of spaceships, space stations and spaceships on the 928 box.  This set is like 20 lego sets rolled into 1!

Finally, a point some people might not realise...if this set is ever released, there will be 1 very important thing missing: the box.  Those 80's classic space sets are lovely! I just love the plastic inner tray shaped like craters, the plastic lid, and the flap on the box that lifts up.  Lego just don't release legends sets like this, so no one should pass up on buying one NOW! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Until reading the comments on this set I never thought of the connection to the Star Destroyer design from the early Star Wars movies.  It's fairly obvious to me now that it was inspired by that design, but Lego made it much more fun and not as cold looking.  I think it's the windsheilds that gives this ship it unique look.  

I still have the peices for this set but the box and original instructions are long lost.  Someday I hope to find them at a decent price.

We were reminiscing about toys we played with when we were young, and of course space lego came up.  At the time we hardly remembered what any of the sets were called let alone looked like.  I should have known the internet would be littered with information on the subject. 

Anyway when I saw the Galaxy Explorer photo again on this page, for the first time in probably 20 years, it brought back a flood of memories from when I was a kid.  I had totally forgotten about this set up until that point.  What a great thing the Internet can be...and what a great site this is. 

I must have been around 9 years old when this set hit shelves.  I've since purchased the complete set in it's original box from Ebay.  One of the most satisfying purchases I've made in a while. Who would ever sell this set? (I suppose my parents did sell mine).  These sets will forever remind me of a time when toys were simple, innocent and really cool all at the same time. 

Happy Exploring.

I found the plans for the Galaxy Explorer at brickshelf.com and to my suprise I was able to build the entire thing (minus the antenna that goes on the little space hut).  I didn't even realize that I had that set.  25 years was a long time ago. 

Great design.  Looks cool.  Much like the 918 (which I have the box for but not all the pieces) but larger.

Regardless, this is a true lego classic for anyone who is or was a fan of the space series.
Even if you were born well after the 70's you have to appreciate how cool this design was.

This set is one classic from the theme space, and was released in 1979. This is the same set as 497, only have differences in the numbers and in the name, the other version is known too, as Galaxy Explorer,(the set 497 was released in US). This have 325 pieces, useful contents and good uses for them at all, in the building it have so much imagination and creativity to the buildings. 

-Contents:
The contents there are very useful, being as bricks, plates, and other pieces. As example, is hard to think that with only bricks and plates can be made the glass of the cockpit, now it is hard to happens. Though the set have those pieces, it keeps a good design and likeness with classic lego sets and with spaceships. Some other contents like the minifigures and their contents are too very useful, though they don't have visors, they have the likeness of astronauts though colorful.
 
-Building (Space cruiser):
In the first steps of building, starting from the spaceship (known as Star cruiser or Galaxy explorer), it's main part have almost all many plates, also in the shape of wing to complete some parts of the front keeping a good design to the set. The plates are the original ones, and the base of the spaceship being made of many plates, it have many studs, keeping possibilities to creations and a nice design. In some parts without many plates are added pieces known sometimes as tail, that can be useful to the current and old days, as in this set, keeping plates above it while putting bricks in the central part to make the place where can be putted the pilot minifigure. Above the &quot;tail&quot; pieces, the &quot;bracket&quot; pieces can do the work to add more contents on the set in each set, as example, putting round bricks on the back and cone pieces on the front, what makes a good effect to the spaceship.

In the central part of the spaceship, the place to the pilot can be completed by slope bricks, bricks and simple plates in different sizes. And some of them make a good scheme in the color, and are very compatible with the building, like the translucent pieces that makes good effects and keeps in design as the glass of the spaceship. The upper plate of the cockpit in this time of building can moves to back due to two conjunctions of hinge pieces (the top and base).

In the back of the spaceship, differently of other parts of the set, have another type of plates, a complete hinge plate and a bigger plate above it. In the sides of this plate, above other &quot;wing&quot; plates where placed clear plates(or known as plates without studs), that works correctly with the hinge bricks close to it that with some bricks can makes moves &quot;doors&quot; on it's back. And about doors, a bit in the front of the &quot;doors&quot; on back, have good locations to the door pieces. Altough this spaceship have door pieces, the minifigures can't use this to enter in the part inside it, but the doors are good itens in the set.

In the parts close to the pilot's chamber, (as example, the parts where the door pieces are located after built) some yellow translucent pieces were added, keeping a place inside it and the design of the front. In the sides of the main part of the spaceship, with some cone pieces, can make some parts (that likes rocket engines). So after those steps, are added some contents to the spaceship (or embelishments), like the other cone pieces, some on the back, keeping in design, or in the base of the set, as the landing gears. Or others, like antenas and the bricks with positioning rockets.

Finishing the building steps makes easy the understanding of the set. On the front of the set have a place with many studs (that is better than overspecialized pieces without studs), and in the central part starts the parts where the pilot can pilot the ship (and this part is very detailed, includes too control panels in this). And on it's back have too another place(or chamber) that have a good measurement and can keeps a nice cart (nice though simple)inside it. The cart is made with plates with wheels, other types of plates and with a plate with a single stud on it where can be putted a gray airtank piece, making it's conclusion. Also at the back, the cart go inside by a ramp made by a plate. This ramp directs to inside the spaceship. To access the ramp, have two parts on the back that works well as doors and can be connected by a plate. It don't have landing gears, but pieces under the base of the ship, and works well to put it on plates and in the playability.

-Building (moon base):
After that, have the moon base. Is said that the base is on moon, but currently the space sets are on mars... But it still cool as a base in any place of the space. The building of the base starts in a baseplate with craters (what makes this more reallistic). The support is made by some blue 1x2 slope pieces and between those some 2x2 bricks. On the sides there are some &quot;tail&quot; pieces that are connected between studs, can be connected above some 2x8 plates that connects well with the slope bricks and simple bricks. Above the plates, there are some bricks that makes the tower, and also place to the minifigures, that keeps an easy access to control panels. It have also the same translucent yellow bricks and too the logo from classic space. The building of it over when is putted the roof (that is a plate), with other details like the antena with side spokes. And too with another building made with a bracket piece, some pieces and a round dish piece. To complete the base have only to add some plates to connect with a bigger baseplate, this that could be useful too to airports, and have too the studs to put the translucent 1x1 round bricks (in the case, red).

-Playability:
When the building of the spaceship and moon base are finished, it's time to play with! In this set includes four minifigures (two red, two white), well equipped with the packs on their backs and helmets of astronauts. Includes too useful tools to Lego scenery. This set have the contents to make the minifigures busy, one piloting the spaceship, other in the base, other piloting the cart (or space buggy), and other on the moon's floor, signaling to the spaceship lands on the port. It have too printed pieces, more times showing the classic symbol of classic space, and those printed pieces are useful, more than stickers sometimes, because where need stickers are clean pieces. The craters are very well made, and the designs of the plates are too. The spaceship fits well in the baseplate of the &quot;port&quot;. It includes too with a great scheme of colors, quality of pieces and very good building.

-Availability:
This set now is hard to find and hard to get (it was released in 1979), is on sale on sites like bricklink, and there you can't find it cheaper than $120.00, and in some other sites it have the average of $100,00. If it can be cheap is better verify if the sale is based in bids, so if you find it cheap and really want it, is better run to good opportunnities. It is basically hard to find because it is old but with so many value as a classic.

Here are the basic Pros and Cons about the set:
-Pros:
Amazing spaceship;
It's inventory have many useful bricks, plates, and original pieces;
Four minifigures!
Building ideas (images of other buildings made with the same pieces are on the set's box);
Awesome tower (or base);
Cool baseplates;
Useful contents at all.
-Cons:
Don't includes blue, yellow or black classic space minifigures... just kidding, would be cool if those minifigures were released with the set, but the included on this are cool too.
So, there aren't any cons basically.

Overall, this set is great and one of the best meanings of the words &quot;classic space&quot;. It is close to the top rated sets, and it's rank is well deserved. I recommend this set to Space fans, Classic Lego fans, Lego space fans, and fans of Mars Mission (yes, it have a place on the spaceship to carry vehicles, like some sets from Mars mission, but some notable differences among the two themes are the pieces and the color scheme). It gets easily a 5/5.

"BrickPiet44","2008-11-19T09:59:04.123Z","Perfect set, set the standard for space sets, expensive and hard to find, but worth every euro, so go out and by it","This set is the ultimate classic space set. It is one from the early years of space sets and it is indeed a set that set the standard for space sets, and has never been surpassed since then.
Plus:
Design is of the space ship very very good. The space ship simply looks as a space ship should look. 
Thrusters on the wings, underneath the wings and at the back.

The grey plates, the blue bricks and the yellow windows are a very good colour combination. The trans red, yellow and black add nice colour detail.

The back of the space ship can be opened to store a small vehicle.

The spacefigs can sit in the cock pit, which can be opened neatly with the trans yellow roof.

This all sounds as a technical list of plusses, but you will understand exactly what I mean when you hold it. It is simply perfect.

The moon base plates offer a landing base and a place to start playing.

Several minifigs add to playability.

The antenna house is rather basic but fits the needs for playability.

Minus:
Not one to honest. I could mention as a minus that the set is hard to find and that when you find is it is usually expensive, sometimes very expensive.
But considering all the plusses it is very much worth the money.

So only one advice is possible: buy it, build it, enjoy.

<p>It really is such a fantastic set that any and all AFOL should count as a must have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My one has become a favourite with my 6yo son now even amongst all his and my lego sets from the past to present. And this set sits front and center in my Space/Star Wars theme only Lego display cabinet.</p>

You either had this set, or you wanted it. I sadly was in the latter category, this set&#39;s price tag at the time put it out of reach. Until yesterday, when I finally held one of these in my hands for the first time and can call it my own. And it certainly did not disappoint.</p>

<p>This set graces the cover of <em>Great Lego Sets: A Visual History </em>and could be considered Lego&#39;s greatest ever set. It was the flagship set that launched one of Lego&#39;s most fondly remembered themes, Legoland Space.</p>

<p>The spacecraft itself is just magnificient. It has a large footprint but at the same time was not too massive to be held comfortably in a young pair of hands. It&#39;s undercarriage, built up with lots of good old fashioned light grey plates and wing pieces, makes the whole structure very sturdy, and it is surprisingly light. The practicality of the design is just as good as it&#39;s aesthetics.</p>

<p>The build was an elaborate one for it&#39;s day, but quite straightforward. Also the instructions for this set contain something very unusual for the time, but very common today. Most of the steps in the instruction booklet have a list of parts used in that step. Very helpful for that large expanse of light grey that makes up the underside of the ship!</p>

<p>The playability of the set was enhanced with the addition of a landing pad alongside a crater baseplate, with a small but functional booth type building and radar dish. A small simple buggy is also included as a payload for the back of the spacecraft, which the four space minifig crew can use to explore the distant worlds where they land.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The LL928 &quot;Explorer&quot; starship is the stuff of LEGO legend, and while many love it just for its nostalgic value, I&#39;m going to try to review it as I would any other set. So, is the Galaxy Explorer worth the nearly $250 most charge for it? How does it stack up to modern sets in terms of design and playability? Read on to find out</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are normal for a set of this time period. They feature simple, but still well-done, images of the parts and model. They&#39;re a bit hard to follow, but are still of a relatively high quality.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set. The&nbsp;red space man, of which there are two, features a classic space logo on his torso, and that generic, smiling,unisex face. The two&nbsp;white space men&nbsp;are essentially the same, but with a white torso, legs, air tanks, and helmet.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Building this model is hard. It took about 2 hours, which is a long time for a 340-part set, and this is mainly due to the instructions asking you to put around 10 parts on per step.</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>When completed, the set looks great. The ship is a little blocky by today&#39;s standards, but still sleek enough, and the moonbase is well done despite its small size. The famed baseplates are just as awesome as I expected, and it all just&nbsp;<em>works</em>.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The set has a good amount of stuff in it, and some basic play features, that make it a pretty good toy, as well as an awesome collector&#39;s item. The rear cargo bay opens, and the little rover can actually roll out, as opposed to today&#39;s &quot;boarding ramps&quot; that you have to shove a minifig up into. The moonbase has a lovely computer and communications dish to signal the rest of your fleet, and there is enough terrain around it for a minifig to explore. There is also a perfect amount of figs, because you have two to sit in the cockpit, one to sit on the rover in the cargo bay or on the terrain around the moonbase, and one to use the computers in the moonbase.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of blue, grey, and trans yellow. There are some nice prints, and a trans-yellow plate.</p>

<p>Overall, this is both a great toy and a great display item.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T14:27:03.523Z","In Classic Space, no-one can hear you scream with excitement!!!","<p>I am an epic fan of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is very simple by today&#39;s standards, so demanding in detail. The trans yellow parts are awesome. The tracking station seems a little pointless except for the huge dish you get with it.</p>

<p>Playability is huge.The minifigs may not have anyone to shoot but there&#39;s plenty of moon stuff that is fun. I still have a copy of the 1980s magazine with a recommended rebuild of this set. I haven&#39;t be able to bring myself to yet. This biggest of early classic space is infinitely entertaining on it&#39;s own, though I admit, I would love an LL924.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Value for money is getting worse and worse as the original set remains rare and demand from us old timers remains high. Sunburn and fatigue are doubtless taking their toll on the remainders.</p>

<p>Pros -&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s Epic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s swooshable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s way better than all the re-released Star Wars tat.</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>Lacks detail (everything did back then).</p>

<p>The locking mechanism (a flat tile) for the cargo doors is a bit lame now.&nbsp;</p>
