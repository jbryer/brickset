Pros: Price (comes out to just above $1 a fig)
      Selection (bunch of cleaning crew, race driver, a few good men and women in uniform, even some astronauts)
      And the extras! Chef, his pizza, parrot, monkey, bicycles, etc.
      
Cons: Only one gripe here, and that's that next to everybody's got some kind of a work uniform on, and almost nobody's a regular; if it isn't coverall worker or a cop, it's the red-vest uniform. The Octan people are just about regulars, so are the doctors, scuba guy, and there are two regular white shirts walking around. 

Not that I really mind; two cops and two airline pilots are definately exciting enough. 

Oh! And I can't believe they did away with the classic motorcycle.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-09T15:23:04Z","Amazing","This set is the ultimate addition to any lego city or any fan of classic town, or just anyone who has lego!
This has a whole range of different classic town people and they are all equipped with the tools of their trade. Although the price may seem a little bit steep for just minifigs, i can assure you it is totally worth it. this will really boost the population of your lego figs and can literally amuse you for hours.
Great work, and thanks a lot lego!
