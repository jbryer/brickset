Perfect for Alpine style houses (Swiss, Austria, South Germany) or to build a different looking roof, mixing the two angles as is often sen in houses built in the 1930's in the Netherlands.&nbsp; <br><br>I can't remember the price, but it can't be much, since i bought it from my pocket money. Now i wish i had gotten more of these sets, especially since my oldest son will soon be playing with my 30-35 yo Lego blocks :D<br><br>over time you will appreciate the possibilities these stones have, hence the 5/5 on all items.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
