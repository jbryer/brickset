"T79","2014-07-03T09:24:21.25Z","Nice, but less so for minifigs","<p><font color=""#000000"" face=""Times New Roman"">Again an older set I received as a hand-me-down when I was a small child, like the others this one came without box or instructions but in this case that fortunately didn&#39;t matter at all.</font></p>

<p><font color=""#000000"" face=""Times New Roman"">There is a nice selection of doors included of which my favourites have always been the big yellow &#39;barn doors&#39;. Since they are from an era before the arrival of minifigs they are rather small with a height of only four bricks. This used to frustrate me to no end as I had these beautiful doors that could hardly be used with minifigs, let alone their tractors.</font></p>

<p><font color=""#000000"" face=""Times New Roman"">The fences however have always been useful, 18&nbsp;regular fences and 4&nbsp;gates (the only gates in my possession)&nbsp;ensured gardens were always well enclosed as they at least were still at all times&nbsp;compatible with minifigs.</font></p>

<p><font color=""#000000"" face=""Times New Roman"">So in the end it really is a shame that those doors are not&nbsp;one brick higher as&nbsp;they would have seen a lot more use then, but with the minifig not yet born when this set came out this can hardly be held against it.</font></p>
