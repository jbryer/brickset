"sabpol","2007-06-23T22:05:13.357Z","My first Expert Builder set","I bought this set at Toys R Us in 1982.  I had gone into the store looking for a Town system set that turned out not to be there.  My mom suggested I buy this set instead, which looked funny to me because the pieces had holes going through the sides.  

It turned out to be one of my favorite sets ever.  It has excellent playability.  I built everything from a helicopter to an eggbeater with this set.

The only drawback about the design of this set is that there is not enough resistance between the gears and the tires in pushing the piston up and down.  The rear tires have difficulty turning to propel the piston unless you push down on the back of the go-cart.  But it's well worth the $22 I spent on it.

"no_skill","2010-01-11T06:20:45.75Z","Excellent Early Technic Set","This is an excellent early Technic set, referred to as Expert Builder back in the day.  While not the first, the beam-&-pin construction technique was still fairly novel at the time.  The primary model is a satisfactory rendition and has many of the same features of the larger and much more expensive sets in the line, namely functional steering and a gear driven piston within the engine.  Rare (though perhaps not exclusive) elements included soft rubber tubing, in addition to the relative exclusiveness of Technic eleements in general.  I think the set stands up to time quite well, and given its 1977 vintage, proves itself a truly exceptional set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"TheLegoMaster35","2018-03-14T00:00:43.023Z","Great Set, Even if Hard to Find","<p>I got this set from my grandpa when I was young(ish) as a gift. Overall it is one of my favorite sets I own and almost never gets taken apart because of its simplicity and the sake that it&rsquo;s one of the older technic sets I own. The instructions are VERY clear and even give you inspiration to build alternate models along with pictures of models that can be built using this set and others. Another awesome feature is the inclusion of a clear sorting tray. As far as I&rsquo;m aware, they(LEGO) stopped incorporating these pretty early on, which is a shame, because it is quite useful. One of the few cons is that the id sticker is a STAMPS(STicker&nbsp;Across Multiple PartS) mine flakes of and disappeared a long time ago and not much except residue remains.&nbsp;</p>
