"rg00372","2014-03-15T18:54:21.88Z","Worth the wait?","<p>Recently rediscovered Legos and this set was one that I wanted very badly as a kid.&nbsp; With the help of Ebay and Bricklink I was finally able to own a complete example of this one.&nbsp; The main&nbsp;attraction of this set&nbsp;had always been the crawler tracks, how cool would it be to build all kinds of different&nbsp;tracked vehicles?&nbsp; Bulldozers, excavators, tanks, so much more fun than wheels!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I got my hands on a box but it is definitely showing it&#39;s age.&nbsp; That said, it is still a great setup for storing and segregating the different types of parts and making the build easier through some built in pre-sorting.&nbsp; Instructions are ok for an experienced builder, might be tough to follow for a novice (especially the secondary models).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The coolest part is the crawler tracks, hands down.&nbsp; It also has a good assortment of other Technic type parts, the big gears are nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does&nbsp;seem that what was available at the time put some definite limitations on how good the end product could be, for example the dumping mechanism would be vastly improved with some of&nbsp;today&#39;s lift-arm pieces.&nbsp; I&nbsp;may end up redesigning this one with the addition of&nbsp;some modern parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is one tricky section on this one, the bucket dumping mechanism.&nbsp; Getting the gear racks lined up with each other and&nbsp;all of the axle shafts connected is really finicky.&nbsp; Once assembled, it does not operate that smoothly and the axles have a tendency to pull out of the pin connectors.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The bulldozer looks great when fully assembled.&nbsp; The functionality leaves a lot to be desired.&nbsp; The aforementioned issues with the dumping/bucket tilting mechanism.&nbsp; Another issue is that the lifting mechanism will not stay at a fixed position unless you have the bucket all the way up.&nbsp; If you let go halfway up, it will fall back to the lowered position.&nbsp; One fix for this would be modifying the mechanism to include a worm gear, not sure if those were available back when this one was introduced.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great looking kit.&nbsp; The crawler tracks were a&nbsp;seriously cool&nbsp;and unique feature&nbsp;when this one came out, it seems like there are quite a few more recent sets that have&nbsp;crawler tracks&nbsp;that make this one a bit less of a &quot;must have&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacing the axle shaft/pin connector sections of the&nbsp;lifting and&nbsp;dumping mechanism should be a good improvement and make this one more&nbsp;than just a nice&nbsp;display piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still feel there is&nbsp;value in this set,&nbsp;especially the potential of combining&nbsp;it with other expert builder/technic sets to build unique creations.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I acquired this set in 2014 without instructions. &nbsp;Thank you to those who went before me for scanning the instructions. Sometimes I had trouble identifying parts and placement due to the lowish&nbsp;jpg quality of the scans.&nbsp;I am hoping that folks with hardcopies rescan&nbsp;and save&nbsp;instructions at higher resolutions now that storage and bandwidth are cheaper than in the time when dial-up modems were common.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is the first model I have constructed where the ridged pieces had a mechanical function instead of being decorative.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are not part of this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Squeezing parts tightly together is&nbsp;necessary for the transmission to work smoothly. &nbsp;The rubber bands shown in the instructions are necessary to keep the bucket from&nbsp;falling from a lifted position. &nbsp;The model is satisfyingly&nbsp;operable. &nbsp;I wonder if small servos would have enough torque to power the drive train.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model was completely playable with 6 and 7 year olds</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am glad my son and I had a chance to play with it. &nbsp;Soon it will be time to pass it on to a new owner.</p>
