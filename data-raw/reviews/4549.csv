<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions for both of the main models (the second is a high-wing airplane) were easy to follow.&nbsp; The box was the classic plastic-lined box with bins and a fitted cover.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As an early expert-builder set, this set had parts that were hard to get elsewhere (at the time).&nbsp; It was an unfortunate yellow, but I daresay that&nbsp;the color&nbsp;made the instructions easier to read, at least.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>No big problems during the build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The way the control stick manipulates the angle-of-attack of the rotor blades while still allowing for rotation&nbsp;is very clever and insipiring.&nbsp; And fitting both the drive system and control system into such a tight space using these simple parts is pretty amazing.&nbsp; Add to that the ability to motorize the rotor and tail prop with one of the 4.5v motors and this was a very entertaining set to build and play with.&nbsp; Unlike the Auto Chassis&#39; girders-and-gears appearance, this also looks somewhat like the vehicle it is intended to model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This was a fun set back in the day.&nbsp; A modern technic remake would not achieve a whole lot of improvement beyond appearance, IMO.</p>
