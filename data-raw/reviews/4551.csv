I have hundreds upon hundreds of sets in my collection but almost all of them are based upon minifigure scale. This just happened to catch my eye. I think I enjoy the fact that it has functioning gears and mechanisms and yet has so many standard, fairly basic elements. So much charm and yet sophistication! Especially for the context of the late 70s!!!<br />
<br />
The elements indeed by today&#39;s standards are very basic. But the fact that it is so smooth, operational and realistic in many ways makes this such a modern work of art. I am still honestly shocked that this is the first review of this amazing set. From my limited research so far, it seems this is the original precursor to the Technic super cars of the past 40 some years. How does this not have more fanfare?<br />
<br />
Either way, I am very lucky to own it and would hope this model will be on a display some day at a museum. It really is a piece of modern art and an excellent interpretation of a car chassis. For now, it will be on display in a nice cabinet in my living room among vases and pieces of original art while most of my other Lego sets will remain in my basement. That is how highly I regard this set and the overall aesthetic qualities.</p>
