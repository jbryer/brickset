"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:51:46Z","Light up your life","The 970 light blocks set can add another dimension of realism to your Lego experience.  I have used mine exclusively with Technic sets (about 25 different ones), but that shouldn’t discourage anyone from using this set with sets from any of Lego’s other realms (Space Legos come to mind, picture the 928 with big landing lights).  They look best on big supercar kits (like for the pop-up headlights of the 8865).

The heart parts of this set are two bricks that ingeniously contain light bulbs.  Power for these light bricks comes from the usual motor battery box (which is not supplied with the 970, you have to use one from 870, 744, 912, etc).  However, the 970 is supplied with power cords, several different hued transparent bricks (so you can check out all the wild colors, dude), and a little idea booklet.

If you got the 970 kit just by itself and had no other Legos, then you probably wouldn’t have much fun with it.  It does bring new light, er, life to old models, though, and can enkindle the imagination by igniting the fires of creativity, brightening the world with visions of illumination.  

Ahem.  Since it’s more of a fun accessory than an essential kit (like a motor), the 970 scores 8/10, 25 April 2004

(Available between 1978 and 1986) The lighting bricks are great for adding 'life' to houses, cars and trains. I fitted one in the cab of a 182 locomotive to give a 'firebox' effect, and inside train carriags for those 'overnight' trips. The lighting bricks in both my sets are yellow although I have obtained some loose red lighting bricks. (I don't know which set they originally came from).</p>
<p>You can run the bricks from the old 4.5v battery box, or simply rig up a bog standard&nbsp; 4.5 battery with a switch.</p>
<p>Also the set comes in a neat little box with polystryne innner tray.</p>
<p>If you are looking to buy a set, make sure it has the correct pairs of translucent red, yellow, green and blue bricks as well as the 6 stud, 'Taxi' 'Police' and 'Station' bricks.</p>
