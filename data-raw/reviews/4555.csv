This set is the predecessor and is just as good, in fact many people who are interested in robotics proceded to buy RCX instead of getting an NXT. It's basicness and usability is a prime factor here. Before NXT my school has a single RCX set. The whole brain brick have studded areas here and there and I always though how cool it would be to have a LEGO pirates vignette set on top of the RCX brick. (Haha, just kidding). Perfect for beginners and younger robotics fans.
