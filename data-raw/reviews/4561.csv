The program-on-face part is easy to use, and very convenient for trial programs.  The only drawback of that feature is that it has limited commands, but it is still easier to use then the program-on-face string on the NXT.  The parts included are colorful and imaginative, and the instructions are very clear.  This is an excellent set for anyone just getting into robotic building, who needs to get used to how the parts, sensors, motors, and program go together.  It is also good for older robotic builders who need something to test programming options on.  Gets an nine out of ten, because nothing is perfect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
