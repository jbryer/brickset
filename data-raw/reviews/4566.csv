<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set came with a fair number of rare parts, including the printed R2-D2 panels, <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4125368"">blue </a>and white &#39;wing&#39; parts, and appears to be the only set to include the white <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4125374"">64mm corrugated pipe</a> piece. (Check out the BrickLink entry <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?id=39451&amp;idColor=1&amp;view=buy&amp;ccName=4125374#T=S&amp;C=1&amp;O={%22color%22:1,%22ss%22:%22JP%22,%22iconly%22:0}"">here</a>)</p>

<p>It was also one of the few sets to include teal <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4140804/2m-fric-snap-w-cross-hol"">2M Fric. Snap W/Cross Hole</a> pins.</p>

<p>The Micro Scout Controller, whilst advanced for its time, seems dated today, with only one built-in light sensor and one motor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong></p>

<p><em>L3GO</em></p>

<p><em><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51809508309_4e165fcd08_k.jpg"" /></em></p>

<p>Being the first model in the instruction manual it is also the simplest. It either moves in a turning arc or in &#39;straight&#39; line. In reality, it veers ever so slightly towards the right, given that the entire model is essentially driven by the left wheel.</p>

<p>There is also an over reliance on rubber bands to provide friction for the arms, as the past two decades haven&#39;t been kind to said rubber bands. Without rubber bands providing the needed tension, the arms would just remain limp by the sides.</p>

<p>The finished model is much less scary than that depicted in the instruction booklet however, perhaps due to the lighting.</p>

<p><em>R2-D2</em></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51809508349_d1bf1903d8_k.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There were two versions of R2-D2s that you could build, however the one shown above is the one without official instructions. When constructed, a wheel contraption spins around within R2-D2&#39;s head, driven by simple gearing powered by the controller&#39;s motor. The second play feature, if one manages to get it to work, shoots out an arm. However, that feature seems to rely on rubber bands too, so it&#39;s prone to malfunction.</p>

<p>The main R2-D2 model has similar functions to L3GO above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Battle Droid on STAP</em></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51809997163_0ee37c37ac_k.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This was probably the hardest model to put together given that there weren&#39;t any official instructions. The original base also featured some... questionable building techniques hence the base shown above is slightly different.</p>

<p>However, this is arguably the most interesting model, given that you have to try to knock the battle droid off the STAP and that the build itself looks relatively clean, unlike the alternate R2-D2 model which just looks... bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Despite all its flaws, in terms of playability, it probably beats most of the 2022 lineup so far. The fact that you&#39;re encouraged to try and work out alternate models yourself, is something that is somewhat lacking in modern LEGO sets.&nbsp; I&#39;ve spent hours on this set, yet I&#39;ve only built four of the eight models suggested on the back of the box.</p>

<p>Is it a flawed set? Certainly. Does it have questionable building techniques? Sure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will I dismantle it tomorrow and attempt another model? Absolutely.</p>

"PIRAKA_06","2017-06-24T21:38:54.77Z","Mindstorms meets Star Wars ","<p>This set doesn&#39;t have a good review on Brickset right now, so here is a (hopefully) more helpful review of 9748: Droid Developer Kit!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Box / Instructions</strong>: The box is kind of a thin cardboard that holds a firm inner box. Inside is a plastic sorting tray, which is very helpful rather than having the pieces&nbsp;in a big pile. The Constructopedia (instructions) come both in physical form which tells you how to build a Trainer droid, R2D2, and a Jedi Knight droid. We will get to those later. Also included is a CD with building challenges and digital building instructions for the same models in the Constructopedia. Because the software is not quite optimized for newer PC&#39;s, it is not too important unless you want to make some of the exclusive&nbsp;models only on the CD. Have I gone on too long with the instructions?</li>
	<li><strong>Parts</strong>: The kit comes with plenty of cool parts, including a pair of specialized R2D2 panels. It also has a lot of other neat beams and liftarms&nbsp;for the time. Where else are you going to get 20+ white studded beams? Yet again why would you need them nowadays... Anyways, the star of the parts list is the Microscout, the brain. It has a light sensor and a motor built in so anyone can try building a droid. And better yet, if you don&#39;t know how to program (or don&#39;t want to), 9 programs are built in! They all demonstrate what the Microscout can do. For anyone wondering, the P program was a program&nbsp;meant for set 9739, which was never released. There&#39;s more about it on the internet.</li>
	<li><strong>Build</strong>: Building the models is&nbsp;fun, sometimes a little tedious. Nothing too difficult. You know what is difficult? Getting the CD to work! With a Quicktime&nbsp;update&nbsp;it&#39;s fine (at least on XP), but I thought i&#39;d mention it.</li>
	<li><strong>Completed models</strong>: I won&#39;t go too deep into the models (this review is long enough!), but i&#39;ll&nbsp;summarize what they do.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>L3GO: Rolls around with a simple dive gear system&nbsp;and has a turning arc when going backwards. Has poseable arms and neck.</li>
	<li>R2D2: Rolls around with a semi-complex drive gear system&nbsp;and has a turning arc when going backwards.</li>
	<li>Jedi Trainer Droid: Rolls with a complex drive gear system. Has a gripper in the front that has a gear and flex-cable system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong>&nbsp;It was a great idea for LEGO to use their new Star Wars license with the robot, or droid building of Mindstorms.&nbsp;And it was also a good way to introduce younger builders to LEGO Mindstorms. Though for older builders, it&#39;s best as an expansion for the Robotics Invention System. Getting it now isn&#39;t necessary, but for younger builders who want to build robots&nbsp;and likes Star Wars, it&#39;s perfect.&nbsp;</p>
