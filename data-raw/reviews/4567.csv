It walks like it's pregnant (so this is were little atats come from!). No wonder they fell so easy on Hoth. It's overall design is okay, but to open for the massive ATAT. A nice detail is the moving head while it walks. It took me a few minutes to realise this was not done by the motor. The head swung because of the left to right movement of the whole body. Nicely done lego! It still stands behind me, although I recently took out the motor. It's always an appreciated sight (both by parents and children) to see it move. Children think it's great and parents want to know how it works (probably so they can play with it!) It's always nice to look AT . Thanks to my wife for giving it to me xxx ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Spit_Fire_22","2008-08-07T23:13:04.903Z","Great","I reckon this set is great it has ton of parts. You can make 9 models and the things you can just out of your imangination are endless.

Pros
Tons of parts
great for kids to learn about gears
lots of fun
plus it does somthing after you build it(not just a toy to sit on the shelf)

Cons
Price
and thats it 

If you see it out cheap get it. Hours of Fun",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"P13c30fch33s3","2009-08-24T07:48:54.217Z","Brilliant Innovation (considering the time of its creation)","This is possibly one of the best LEGO sets ever! Although the console in it may seem very simple, it lead to one of the greatest Lego computers: The NXT

I will review this set per book, because there are really no sections in this set.

Book 1: Sith Apprentice
This is the first book. It has the instructions for some of the most basic robots ever, although these are good for the (i think) 7 year olds who got this for their birthday, good report, etc
It is also good for basing other designs on as the frame is easily customisable.
Book 1 also shows a basic walker frame useful for making four-legged walkers.

Book 2: Sith Knight (i think)
This has more advanced designs including a Droideka (Destroyer Droid)
In the back of the book, helping you to customise your creations.

Book 3: Sith Master
This book has quite advanced designs. Not to be used if you don't have at least 20 mins spare. This book includes plans for an AT-AT and a challenge AAT. If you want to build these, don't lose your parts. It may cost you a lot.
This booklet helps if you are making your own advanced designs.

Summary: Great set if you want to improve your technic building skills. Also helps when building Mindstorms robots. Not good if you are fussy about looks (they look horrible compared to the other [proper] models).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
