Chocomel is a brand of chocolatdrink and this is the only set they've had made for this brand.  The building has a crane mechanism like you can see in Amsterdam, so it really is a genuine Dutch set :)

I posses one myself, but unfortunately I did not have the stickers (destroyed 24 years ago).  Fortunately there are people who can remake these stickers these days, so my set is once again complete.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Thanks to its design and colour scheme this building will stand out in any lego town consisting of existing sets. Therefore it is most likely the birth-house of a famous painter, or the first factory with which an inventive entrepreneur laid the fundaments for his billion-dollar multi-national corporation. In any case, this building probably has some sort of historic relevance for your town.

The thing that always fascinated me most about this set was the question about what lies behind. What will you find when you'll venture beyond the archway? I gladly leave it up to all the collectors out there to create an answer to that question.

Finally, the one thing from this set that is not(!) going to make its appearance in your town in one piece, I assume, is the truck of course. That thing needs some serious re-modeling.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Like said before it looks more like a shop than a factory but toys need imagination. The total picture with the truck, flower stall etc. looks very nice, certainly if complete with the (Dutch Chocomel) stickers which I miss unfortunatly but maybe I will find them later. Being Dutch the set has more value to me knowing the Nutricia brand. Overall a nice looking very complete set with a great looking red building built in a recognizable Dutch style.&nbsp;The set&nbsp;fits in great in every town scene you make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks : Nice old school Lego building, starting with the truck and the Flower stall. The building is when finished a nice stable structure with a typical Dutch facade hoist. The style of the ""factory or shop"" is very nice and build out of beams, arches and small bricks. You finish the scene with the street&nbsp;bench and the black lantern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : All very nice parts, the ground plate, nice windows and a lot of usefull bricks but please don't take the set apart to use it for MOC's. The best parts are the (Dutch)&nbsp;stickers if still present, they give the set its own character. Minifigures are chosen very good for the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability&nbsp;4 bricks : the set offers a good playing ability with the streetplate, shop,&nbsp;the truck and minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value&nbsp;5 bricks : An average price is hard to estimate, on <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=1620-2"">Bricklink</a> you see an average sold price of €238,00 and an average asking price of €60,00. Most important is the state and precense of the stickers, are they ok the price will easy rise to €100,00 and it is worth it I think. Another influence is how bad you want it, even without&nbsp;good stickers it's a very rare set.&nbsp;I bought it (without stickers) for €25,00 so a good deal and 5 bricks for me.</p>

As my brother and I owned some Lego City pieces we started saving, that is asking our mum to buy us Chocomelk. Which was not something we drank every day...</p>
<p>But we got the set and when I divided the Lego my brother and I owned I kept this one for myself ;-)</p>
<p>I remember me recently building it to make sure I had all the bricks, at that time the small fence pieces were new to us, these days the bricks are not that special but then they were. And oh I have the sticker nicely on it still, not as shown on the picture though but in the orange/yellow Chocomelk color!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
