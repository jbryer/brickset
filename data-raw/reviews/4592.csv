It brings back good memories, i remember rading this book once i got it. This book tells how they make the stuff on display at lego land, special stuff made out of lego, and even Mt. Rushmore out of LEgo! I am amazed how they made all of these sets, by computer! They even made the sydney opera house, submarine,a town,a globe,books, animals and the statue of liberty!

"sudorum","2009-07-03T17:14:08.107Z","  If only the book was made out of legos....","this book contains tons of lego sculptures created by lego land builders. from Mount Rushmore, to Spock from Star Trek, the models are so life like that at first glance they don't even appear to be made out of legos. Such models are the Sydney Opera House, the statue of liberty, the white house, and Grand Central Station. The book also has a history of when the first elements and pieces came out, plus the process of how a lego brick is created. Also included is the process of how lego land builders get into the business. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"C_Fish","2009-12-05T20:31:16.297Z","Outdated, but still good","First off, I do NOT own this book. I checked it out from my library. It is a nice book, though I feel it could use more content about themes.

Pros: Nice Pics.
        A whole page about Rock Raiders, including concept art

Cons: Too much stuff about the parks, too little about themes

Over all, there is'nt much to say. It's a good book.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
