"Novelty","2007-04-29T13:28:13.793Z","Aim amiss!","This is an odd little set with an archer, a target and some really tall grass.  Play wise, one could pretend to shoot the target with the archer.  The construction is a little weird - how should the bull's eyes be supported by an arch?  Why is the spear attached?  Looks wise, it's interesting - the arch is nice, but it doesn't really make sense.  Overall it's nice, but it would have been better if this was a forestmen set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-23T09:44:54.78Z","King's Archer","This set is one of the small sets of the castle theme, and black knights subtheme. This set was released in 1993, and like some other little castle sets of this subtheme, this have some pieces, useful, and combines a good design with a good building. The playability is basic due to the size, and the design is nice. This include a minifigure of a black knight, like the other, simple and in a classic castle style. Also are included a long bow and a helmet. The building is easy and fast, but all the pieces are useful. The small plate is characteristic of small castle sets like this. There is a plant and a circle to &quot;launch&quot; the arrows on it. There is no arrow to launch in the set, but it still cool. The design is simple and it is a good option to increase some features on your castle collection. Altough this set have no much features, this is a small, playable and usable set. So, i rate the &quot;King's Archer&quot; 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-21T16:26:25.827Z","Let's Pratice Archery!","This is a unique set for a castle theme. You get a knight, a archery target, and some scenery. I would have liked to see another knight minifigure and two targets. Besides that, this is pretty darn good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"phipfwe76","2011-05-27T16:18:41.05Z","Little archer set","<p>Here we have a very, and I mean very, basic set. It's under 20 pieces if you take out the minifig. However it's got a nice charm to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build takes about 2-4 minutes and it very straightforward. The thing that stands out is the unique target which hangs from the arch. Decent play opportunity if combined. This set seems kind of pointless by itself. I purchased it to go with sets 10193 and 7189, where I feel it looks good in the village.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"tjprescott","2011-11-22T02:08:09.667Z","Decent design but nothing special","<div>I received this set as a gift when I was a kid and it was still in production. &nbsp;Today it retails for about $12 on Bricklink for almost 70cents/piece. &nbsp;The little bullseye might be the only somewhat rare piece. &nbsp;The green baseplates and little bush are superfluous. &nbsp;The target design is simple and would make a nice addition to any Castle village. &nbsp;For whatever reason, I always played that hitting a bullseye would cause the target to lift, revealing a portal (too much Zelda for me!). &nbsp;The 10 or so pieces it would take to assemble the target are well worth the investment. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Disclaimer!</h4><div>This set is discontinued. &nbsp;The purpose of my review is to suggest to a LEGO fan whether this is a quality set to add to their collection. &nbsp;My overall rating is based ONLY on Playability and Building Experience. &nbsp;See the ""LEGO Interests"" section of my profile for my review philosophy on discontinued sets.</div>",TRUE,3,2,4,3,1
