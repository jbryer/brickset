Thinking nothing of it, I bought it to complement the winter season as it was very cheap. Putting it together, I knew this was a vintage set and am very happy to own it.</p><p>Although the pieces are pretty basic, this set is more for a decoration and something you can show off to your friends.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,3,5,4,4

Displays well with other Christmas or winter theme sets. Nice addition to a winter village as well. Displaying with other newer snowman sets can show how simple things were in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s compared to today.&nbsp;</p>
