"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-21T11:42:17Z","Great technic model at an affordable price...","I wasn't sure at first but this excavator is well worth the money.  Being an avid fan of Mindstorms and FLL competitions, I had no problem dropping $20 at my local Toys R Us for this set.  I may just get another one to add to my ever growing collection of robotic pieces.  

There are many things that attracted me to this model and they are...

1.  The smaller more compact turntable.  This one piece opens up a whole new world of creativity.

2.  The 20-tooth crown gears will come in handy as they are difficult to find.

3.  The universal joint will replace my broken one.  They are very useful pieces however they do tend to break very easily.

4.  The scoop is kinda cool I must admit.

5.  The design and construction is very facinating to me.  In fact there are two complete instructions for two different models.  

6.  I can play with this thing (in my office).

In the future, I plan to add motors, a dual-differential chasis, and an RCX so I can make a remote control version.  Thank you LEGO and I'm anxiously waiting for more sets like this one at a similar price of course.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T12:17:00Z","Nice excavator","This model is quite nice, it has cool tracks and good funcionability. The only two things I have to say are these:

1. The excavator has only two functions; raising and lowering the arm and moving the dipper and the scoop in one.
All excvator have three functions, but this model has the last two functions in one. It's hard to model that in one funcion, so applause, but that doesn't make the excavator very life-like and it makes the excavator a little bit harder to operate.

2. The whole model is made out of beams, not bricks.
that makes the parts harder to use in combination with the original parts.

And the turntable is very cool!

The second model is a bit dissapointing, you cannot do much with the bulldozer blade.

That brings it to a 7 out of 10.
It has good parts(turntable!) and nice ideas,
pretty good for â‚¬25.

And if you look good on th x-ray picture on the box, you will see that the beam holding the bucket is not attached to the arm!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T15:36:45Z","Pretty cool","I was a big technic fan back when I was little in the 80's. I bought some more sets in the late 90's but I stupidly sold them all and regret it. Now I am rebuilding my technic collection. This is the first one I have got.

It is quite easy to build and doesn't take too long at all. Like with all Lego models, if you make one tiny mistake at the beginning, it will screw up everything at the end. When it is finished it looks quite impressive, and is fun to play.

This is a good beginner set because it doesn't have anything really too complicated in it. I enjoyed it a lot and it has some neat parts. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>This set came out quite a while ago, but it still stacks up fairly well against some of the more recent sets in the same range </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The A model is a tracked excavator.&nbsp; The build took about an hour and is fairly straighforward.&nbsp; The only thing I would note is that there are quite a few places in the construction where an axle is buried completely inside a set of adjacent liftarms or connectors.&nbsp; These axles are a little difficult to extract when you are taking the model apart (a spare axle comes in handy).&nbsp; There are three functions in the A model:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The superstructure can be manually rotated (I'm not really sure if that qualifies as a ""function"", but I'll include it anyway). 
<li>The main boom can be raised/lowered via a gear-knob at the rear of the superstructure. 
<li>The dipper arm and bucket can be extended/retracted via another gear-knob at the rear of the superstructure (i.e. the movement of the dipper arm and bucker are linked together, as they are in many of the other Technic excavator sets -- 8294, 8047, 8069, etc.).</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The B model is a tracked bulldozer with a ripper attachment.&nbsp; Considering the number of parts, this model actually looks pretty good once it is build.&nbsp; The B model has two functions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The dozer blade can be raised lowered by turning a knob that is disguised as the exhaust stack. 
<li>The ripper can be raised/lowered by turning a knob at the top of the cab.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playablility of both models is very good.&nbsp; The functions on both work great.&nbsp; Compared to some of the more recent Technic sets, the 8419 A+B models might not quite stack up in terms of looks, but they are both still pretty good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the parts inventory, this set is pretty basic.&nbsp; You get a good assortment of liftarms, axles, pins, and connectors, as well as&nbsp;11 gears (including two 20T single-bevel gears and two worm gears) and a U-joint.&nbsp; The only parts that are somewhat unique are the bucket, the turntable, the rubber treads, and the tread hubs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably the best comparison for this set is the 8047 Compact Excavator, which is very close in terms of part count, price, and functionality.&nbsp; The A model for the 8047 set looks a little better, as it makes use of flex axles and tread links, but the functionality is identical to that of the 8419 A model.&nbsp; The 8419 B model&nbsp; is definitely better than the&nbsp;8047 B model.&nbsp; If you can find this set for anywhere close to its original retail price ($20), it is definitely worth the investment.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
