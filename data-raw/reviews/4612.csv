to build, but the best part is the fun it is to play with.
The model is stable, and slamming it makes it go forward
FAST with no wobbling, for really far.  Also it has nice
pieces, like the glow in the dark teeth, which looks great
if you slam it in a dark room.  We bought one, and then went out to get more.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
