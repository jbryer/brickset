The remind me of a monster truck tires, the &quot;rims&quot; glow in the dark also. The advantage to the wheels on this car is that it will roll across carpet very easily. The other Racer pull back cars have a very difficult time on carpet. This is a solid set and the dog loves to chase it around the house too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There's some superb parts, including the silver sawblades (guess we know why this thing is called the Buzz Saw) and the chrome engine. Most outstanding is the glow-in-the-dark wheel disks, which really glow brightly! <br></p><p>The Buzz Saw's motor makes it run for a while, and it can really jump if you have a ramp!</p><p>Another great point is the price: only Â£6.99! Talk about value for money!<br></p><h4>Cons</h4>The only real problem with this set is that the 'wheelie' feature doesn't really work that well. <br><br><h4>Pros and Cons at a Glance</h4><ul><li>Pros:</li><li>Well-designed</li><li>Some cool parts</li><li>Glow-in-the-dark wheel disks are spectacular!</li><li>Good price<br></li></ul><ul><li>Cons:</li><li>Stunt feature is a bit lacking</li></ul><br>The Buzz Saw is a brilliant Racers vehicle, and I recommend it to fans of the Racers theme and LEGO in general!<br><br>- maaboo35<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
