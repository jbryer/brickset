Has good piecies great shape, and awesome stichers. it lost a point because i think it should have been more like an x-pod where you can build all sorts a stuff. The thing it comes in is pretty cool, but a waist of lego's plastic. I was also dissiapointed that it didnt have the new wheels like the hot wheel like one. ya, thats right. you know what im talkin bout. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The stickers are not neccessairy for me, I don't put them on it. The pieces are great, It have 2 new 1*1 slopes in orange.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Colour is brilliant, design perfect. Ooooooooh, the air intake and radiator! They've got &quot;Umpff&quot; I want more!

Could have been a definate 10 when there were no stickers and the rims were &quot;Hotwheels&quot;-like. I mean, the Power Cruiser and Street Maniac have excellent rims!

They reminded me of two&nbsp;&nbsp;of my favorite childhood toys (LEGO and Hot Wheels) so I bought them all. The Flame Glider was the best of the bunch for me. The LEGO wasn&#39;t overshadowed by stickers like the other 3 cars in this wave. The orange bricks really stand out and separate this car from the pack. The sloped parts in the back of the roof and rear of the car are great parts as are the grill, engine and 1x1 cheese bricks. The fire exiting the exhaust was and still is a cool detail in my eyes. The fat tires in the rear and skinny tires in the front add to the realistic look the designers envisioned. This is my favorite car from the 1st wave of Tiny Turbos and is one of my favorite of the entire series as well. This car&#39;s look was altered a bit for the Tuner Garage and it looks great in yellow. I also built it in red and this style looks great in any color. These sets really struck me as a great way to enjoy LEGO. You can build a car and display it easily because of the small size. As for the garages, what a waste of plastic! It bugs me to no end how LEGO is so wasteful with this packaging. Not that the cardboard packaging is any better because the boxes are 1 and a half to two times bigger than they need to be.<br />
Great set that still stands out even though the wheels are the old style and LEGO has had a 3 year long time period to improve this line.<br />

"Gus_263","2008-04-26T15:36:28.513Z","Hot Rod","This is another tiny turbo set. This subtheme from racers have some cars without schale to minifigure, because  have a pilot isn't the idea of those sets. One of the firsts from 2005 was this, a good one that looks like with a tunned old car, or a hot rod. This have a good color scheme, like the orange and black. The part above the car have much plates, the black to like with the glass of the car. This don't includes much ramp pieces, but is well designed due to the different size in the wheels. The back ones are bigger, like the wheels from a car from a promotional of shell petrol, and the wheels on the front are smaller, but good positioned next to the motor piece. Some pieces are useful to the racers sets, like the motor ones, or to any system style themes, like creator, city and more. This don't have schale from minifigures, but is useful to creations and to combo models, and these also can be bigger to have a space to these. The back is too well designed, and in black pieces have too fire lego pieces, that can be used on cars, or too in any set, to make a lego scenery. The idea of the set is more playability, this size is ideal to make competition with little cars or tricks with theses. Is a good set, and have different packaging. Is useful, very playable, don't have why don't rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"GSX_R_4S2","2008-06-11T10:56:48.077Z","Great, still surpassed by later designs","I remember getting this set alongside all the other first TTs. This set is great, and is one of the few TTs in orange (The only other full orange one is Flame Blade (that car with Bridge Chase) and the only other two with it are Carbon Star and XR Arrow (that gray and oragne one in BSC)) On to the review...

Positives

This set is awesomely designed, realistically looking like a classic hotrod with a GIGANTIC engine sticking up. The back looks great too, and has full flames on it. It has a custom front grill piece that fits perfectly and doesn't stick out or anything in a desperate attempt to actually put the piece on.

Negatives

The main problem I have here is in term of stickers. Don't get me wrong, the stickers are in perfect color scheme and have it made so that stripes and stuff on actual pieces are not left out. But thse same stickers are one multiple pieces, most notably the back one. I have never seen so many pieces covered by a single sticker. The sticker is not big, but it is very long and forces you to stick with a curved piece, a 1x1 black piece, and a 1x3 orange one. Two more stickers put together a long oragne piece and a square black one. Just on a side note, I really don't like how the sides leading up to the &quot;doors&quot; stick out so wonkily.

If you're a true TT fan, you probably already have this set. But if you are just getting sets for fun, then don't get this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rifraphy","2008-11-20T15:16:24.827Z","Old retro flamy orange hot rod :D","Very sleek! And it contains certain parts which are very useful. Such as, the orange paint job is very shiny and the flamey pieces are very cool. I have about 7-8 of them. 

:: Flame pieces, engine piece, slope bricks and grille piece. 
:: Orange paint job
:: The designers used 2-stud bricks with 1 stud in middle for the body..... Very nice effect, whole body turns out accurate and realistic! Very cool. 

;; Stickers cross three bricks at once

Great set! I recommend you buy it. You can probably buy it on the internet or in the backs of shelves in supermarkets....... ;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-27T10:21:30.807Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - Flame Glider Review","I think this is the second favourite car of the first wave of the LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) theme. I like the orange pieces a lot and I also love the way how LEGO did the engine on the front and on the back. This set is very easy to build but it's a lot of fun to play with. We also get a few stickers which you need to put on and this car can be maneuvered very easily as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
