The colors are different (dark stone) and most of the designs you see on the bricks are printed! The stickers are few with this set. I forgot that this set had printed parts and before I reviewed it I researched it on peeron and was surprised to see printed parts. The printed parts add to the look of the car, unlike the Street Maniac (8644), whose printed parts and stickers are in abundance.
The large tires are not bad but the dark gray wheels are great. There are a lot of cool parts included with this set (wedge plate for windshield, mudguards, silver handlebars, sloped bricks, etc). The overall look of the car is OK.

The colors, basically red, grey, and black have too other colors in few parts. The wheels are greater than others from the same subtheme, making this looks like with a big off road car. The design is cool, altough with big(for tiny turbos) wheels, this have ramp shaped pieces, like the gray next to the black glass, and others on it's back. The grey pieces at the sides of the front are well made, and good positioned to the red(don't crimsom) pieces on the front. One of these can be connected with claw pieces, and back of this could have a grey plate above the grey pieces. But, also this and the printed details(that completes the design for the set) aren't cons, and the rate keeps deserving a good one. The playability is good, due to the size is easy make a race with two or three of these cars or make tricks with one. This set, &quot;Monster Crusher&quot; deserves a 5/5 rate. Good Job, lego!

It's a nice and simple build and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. This little vehicle is very easy to maneuver, too. I also like the design of this car and it's a great small set to have for sure. It's also a great set which you can use for pieces which you can use for your
 future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms. It's a good set to 
have for sure but I would recommend you to get the bigger sets first 
before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
