The motor is overall pretty fast, a lot faster than the pull-back motors from 2003-2004. The glow in the dark pieces were a nice addition, too. The only problem that I had is that the chrome paint chips way too easily. you have to be careful not to drop it where that paint is, or you'll get a big, nasty scratch in the chrome. But in other words, this is a nice addition to my collection of racers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

pros:
+ sleek body
+ glowing stickers.
+ everything else

cons:
- I lost the pieces to build it. most of my lego meets its demise that way

Try to get this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-05T10:24:27.54Z","LEGO Racers (Power Racers) - Night Racer Review","This is one of my favourite LEGO Racers set from the power racers subtheme I've got. It may doesn't have many play feautres but it's a fun build and it's very cool to maneuver it around. It also has a few stickers which you've to put on but you don't get any minifigs. Another cool thing about that car is that we get lot's of pieces which glow in the dark. I also love the color combination with the black and gray pieces. The main feature - and the only feature - is that you can pull this car back to launch the vehicle with the motor piece. It's a really nice set to have and I really enjoy playing with it. This model is worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
