I also took the exhousts off The Exo Stealth and when it comes too LEGO Racing, NEVER mess with BUG 2 becouse she will kick your butt!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Not much bigger than a real Hot Wheels car. New wheels and engine are great. Heaps of small bits to add to the lego tub.

Not big on stickers. Only put the flames on the sides (looks like it's mising something without them). 

Overall it is a great little set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Widdi","2007-11-25T14:53:37.857Z","Muscle","This is a nice little set form the first Tiny turbos wave. It's a very blocky design, but somewhat looking like a classic Muscle car. Contains useful parts, but it's much too low and small scale for minifigs. Overall 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-24T10:19:16.403Z","Rectangle on Wheels","The Power Cruiser is the worst of the original 4 Tiny Turbos. It is basically a rectangle on wheels. The printed wedge is cool as is the engine sticking up in the front of the car but this is the simplest and most plain Racers Tiny Turbo out there. The wheels stick out of the side too far and the studs make an appearance on the front hood and wedge as well which are UGLY. If this set wasn't on clearance I would not have purchased it.

"smiley905","2007-12-30T17:59:59.06Z","this set is soo unrealistic","the basic body is a rectangle with some stickers slapped on and a giant motor on the top to make kids buy it. if you were in the car yuo would have about a 1 inch tal winsheild and a masive motor right infront of you! even if you took it apart what do you do with it? i admit the engine might be cool on other cars but not here. i dont like this set neither should you dont buy it!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-05T23:51:36.45Z","Useful for Parts","I never liked this set because this set is pointless. The windshield should be higher, the engine should be lower, and too many stickers. However, if you want to make something with these parts, go right ahead and use them. The set is terrible, but the pieces are useful.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-10-05T08:13:10.42Z","Go Racers!","Very short and quite longer than the other Tiny Turbos, this set is very good.

Pros:
Short, bling-bling style
Chrome coloured bumper at the front
Nice machine part

Cons:
Stickers

"Gus_263","2008-04-26T15:52:22.607Z","Great for any LEGO fan!","This is a tiny turbo car, little but cool, without pilot, but playable, 46 pieces but useful contents. Why rate it low? If you think that the design frustrates, make a new one with these pieces! If you don't like stickers, put other pieces! The front is simple, but looks like with muscle cars, and the colors are good too. Maybe lego make this to looks like with matchbox or hot wheels, but this can be dismantled and a new model can be builted. The detail of the wheels are cool, and the turbo on the front too, the silver things on this combines with the black to make a good effect. If combined with other sets, is easy to build a bigger car to put a minifigure on this. If you don't like sets like this, you aren't a lego fan, but one who is trying to say about mega bloks. Don't listen to who don't likes lego reviewing these. All cons on this set can be re-made with it's contents. This is useful, playable, the building is easy, and is very well designed. This powerful car &quot;Power Cruiser&quot;, deserves a 5/5 rate!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sger434","2010-01-07T12:27:17.763Z","great","this set is a nice little low rider, like all TT's this set is worth the money, there are some ice chrome parts in there too which make the car more gangsterish 
a great little set the only problem is the wheels they dont turn well and they make a sqeeky noise if the turn too hard but on the other hand a great set

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-25T10:35:07.467Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - Power Cruiser Review","This set is part of the very first wave of the LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) theme. It's an easy build and fun to play with. We also get some stickers to worry about. It's very easy to maneuver this vehicle. I also like the design of this vehicle. It's a great set which you can use for pieces which you can use for your future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms. It's a good set to have for sure but I would recommend you to get the bigger sets first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
