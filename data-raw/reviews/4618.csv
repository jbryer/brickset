Most of the decals are pre-painted on the pieces, very few stickers. Some of the pieces are new so that adds points. Inexpenisve addition to a Lego collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-04T22:57:43Z","Awesome little race car!","The new pieces in this set are awesome. I like how the can can become a garage for it, too. The &quot;Tiny Turbos&quot; are very neat additions to any Lego collection. The Racers sets are getting better and Lego is making more Tiny Turbos later in the year, they are still prototypes though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-24T10:37:11.17Z","Great Parts, Cool Look, Too Many Stickers and Printed Parts However","Street Maniac is a nice little Racers car. It looks beautiful, on par with the Flame Glider until you put on the stickers. There are too many stickers and when coupled with the printed mudguard parts, the car loses all LEGO-ness. It begins to look like a Hot Wheels car. Is this what LEGO wanted, to look like another children's toy and lose what makes their products distinctively LEGO? I built this set with out stickers and labeled parts and it looks stunning. The wheels are great and they are my favorite Racers wheels. The wedge plate to make up the windshield is a great part as well. The plate with Racer grill that makes up the middle front of the car is a great part. I used it to add a nice touch to a Tiny Turbos inspired Go-Kart MOC that is pictured on my Brickshelf Gallery. Copy and paste this link in your web browser to check it out:

"Gus_263","2008-04-26T16:26:07.11Z","Street Maniac","This is a set from the tiny turbos subtheme. Like the other sets from the same subtheme, this is good altough without any pilot minifigure or a place to put one, because this isn't the idea of the set. This is a good packaged set, and have 36 useful pieces. Some have stickers and printed details. If you think that they aren't good, these can be replaced or don't be used. But, this isn't a great con, and this still deserving a good rate. The yellow color makes a good scheme with those stickers, and have good shapes to keep a well made design on this set. Like the parts above the wheels, where are details of the flashlights of the car. A black piece to looks like with the glass of the car is placed low, but still cool. The back spoiler is good to the design, and the wheels too, under the parts of the flashlights, but well made to runs well. This set is useful in any of the 36 pieces, to make combination models or bigger ones where can be putted a minifigure. Altough small, is in a good size for races with many cars, and is easy make tricks with this don't dismantling. For many things, this tiny turbo deserves a 5/5 rate. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's an easy build and I also love the design of this small vehicle. We also get a few stickers which you need to put on and you also get a few printed pieces. The car can be maneuvered very easily and I also like the colors on it. It's a fun set to have for sure.<br><br>All
