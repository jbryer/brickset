"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-17T22:46:11Z","review","I realy thought this set would be awesome when I ordered the colection from a Lego catalog and when it arrived I was realy excited. First I built the dragon, then the catapult thing and after that the serpent. I enjoyed this set and recomend it but I gave it a nine because the wings on the dragon were a bit unstable. Other than that it was great!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T21:15:50Z","I am the same dude as Joshua, I just prefer Josh","This is a really cool set, plenty of possibilities, plenty of cool stuf.  I remember when I got this set, I had to wait quite a while for wal-mart to get it in, but then there came that faithful day when...... they got it in.  As Jay mentioned, thoes wings are quite unstable, but despite this flaw, this is really a cool set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-20T19:16:42Z","Picked this set up today.","Pros:

* Mighty Cheap

* GREAT models

* You can build a catapult out of it.

* LOTS of transparent green parts. ( Yu know, the slopey ones)

* Lime green Pod. I like that color kinda.

* Portable.

* The clear plastic thingy is transparent green. Cool.

Cons:

* the main model 's wings flop around. Not very well thought out.

* Most of the instruction's stuffs are snakes and catupults. OUt of 8 pictured models, 2 were dragons.

* Not really a con, but I wish there was a place to store the instruction booklet. It won't fit inside the pod.

P.S. I am NOT a menace. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lime green pieces</li><li>Hinged pieces made it more playable<br></li><li>You can make it into a CATAPULT! which was my favorite feature<br></li><li>The top and bottom pod pieces could be useful for a satellite <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I think they could have put more models in this book<br></li></ul>
<p>I would recommend this set to any builder, young or old. They might need it for inspiration on what to make. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
