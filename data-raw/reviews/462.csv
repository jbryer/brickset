<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked this best as it wasn't a Santa Claus model, nothing against the big guy in red, but I'd had 2 others and didn't want to redundency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a decent amount of pieces to work with, put the main model together and display it for a Christmas Decoration.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3

It used to belong to her kids, but they didn&#39;t want them anymore since they were adults. Anyway, this is a nice little set for its time. The shaping of the hands and the feet, the garment, and the wings are pretty good. This set has fallen off of my shelf a couple of times and it has survived the fall without breaking. Only the halo has fallen off. The 2x2 round yellow&nbsp;plate is held onto the head by two 1x1 round clear plates. This is not the best connection, but it does the job well. Overall, this is a great little set. LEGO probably will never do something like this again due to the religious reference, so it makes this set all the more special.</p>

<p>I put the angel on top of the Emergency Treatment Center (6380).&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have to be just for Christmas!&nbsp; Alternatively, if you have extra bricks, you could use the instructions to make a whole host of angels for a Christmas display.</p>
