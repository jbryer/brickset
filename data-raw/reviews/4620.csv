"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-07T17:39:20Z","brilliant design, masterful concept.","this is my first x-pod. it is superb. i have now decided to get all others except for Dragon and Arachno (i despise giant spiders). this set is purple, a definite major plus. i have always liked purple (i also have always liked women, so don't get any ideas). i think that the teeth are well colored. if they were glowers, then they wouldn't look as sharp. i really like the featured monster. the catapult beast's teeth are a bit wierdly placed, and the vampire ostritch is nice, but his feet don't really run at all. 

 i really like the x-pod game. a lot of people think that the only models suggested are the three on the front and the suggestions in the  instructions. however, go to lego.com/create/activities/playoff. there is a tab that says  UNITS CATALOGUE. choose a pod, and a list will appear on the left side and you can scroll down to see all of the other registered units, including their level appearances and stats. you can print them all. also, there is a tab called ARENA DESIGNER or something like that. click on the tab and you will design your own arena 'o'      you can choose a theme and click on the board to make obstacles appear. you can also do other stuff at the website.

back to Monster Pod, this set is absolutely marvelous. it is dissapointing that you can only make one special eye (so many units have them), but that is expected. this set is not a great roadtrip set unless you have the unit catalogue printout or if you have memorized it. this is a great set. i will get all of the 1st Generation X-Pods, but not all the 2nd Generation ones, because there are less models you can make with them. this is a great set, so get it or one of the other ones if you are scared of miniscule, plastic monsters or have beef with the colors purple and light green.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-08-09T15:31:27.123Z","Purple monsters","This set was released in 2005, and is a part of the &quot;Make and Create&quot; theme, X-pod subtheme. The X-Pod sets are really basic, but all features useful pieces to any creations. This isn't an exception.

This set is basic, in terms of building and size, but have different models showed in the package (not in the &quot;pod&quot;) and in the instructions book. The main model is a monster with a big eye, with the basic color scheme of purple but with other details with colors like green, white (the eye and &quot;teeth&quot;) and black (at the eye's pupil).

The color scheme is good, though these colors aren't very common in themes like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but you can make anything with these pieces. So, about the building of the main model:

It is very basic, have some green plates as base, and some purple bricks with different shapes to make the details from the small legs, the teeth (the teeth have a good design altough you cannot open the mouth of the monster) and others.

The arms don't moves to the sides, only to up and down. The pieces that makes the arms are very useful, but it could be a bit more increased, because it looks like that don't have hands, and it also don't looks like with tentacles. But the color scheme makes the design very cool. 

The &quot;head&quot; (it is basically the big eye, not really a head) is also connected to the body by a piece that can do movements, it moves to front and back. The eye is basic, made by just four pieces, but have a good style. This little monster also have a tail, wich moves like the arms.

And also, the set includes a &quot;pod&quot;, made by three pieces, where you can use the other pieces, but you can use it to make other creations also.

Overall, this set is very basic but the pieces are useful, and you can make anything with it. The color scheme is nice, though the colors aren't very common (with some exceptions). Now it is a bit rare, because was released in 2005. But you can find it by bricklink, in prices like $5 to $8. 

The playability of the main model isn't very good, but the design is very cool. Altough the set is small, I think that the price worth if you want to get more pieces to add in any creation, but especially if you need any green or purple pieces to increase a set.

Also, the X-pod subtheme have also a &quot;halloween&quot; set (released especially in 08/04, and features the black, orange and gray colors). But the set don't have monsters, it have robots. It is the 4335 (Black robot pod). So, if you want make small monsters of a halloween theme, you can mix this and 4335, that in bricklink is around the same price.

It gets a 4,6 (well, it is a 5 out of 5) for useful pieces, good color scheme, though don't features a great playability because is too small and have limited movements.

I gotta say, the X-pods are GREAT ways to experience Make &amp; Create sets without chewing up a lot of your funds. There are three different options to create in the instruction booklet, but I prefer creating my own stuff and not even bothering with the instructions. There are a good amount of pieces included, and they all have a use somewhere. Keep it up!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
