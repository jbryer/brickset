"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-14T08:16:40.28Z","Worth the $$$","My favorite set of the three is the normal shark, but the hammerhead and the catapult are also pretty neat. Anyway, that's one of the Pros, that this set had the now-gone alternate models. The shark can open his mouth and somewhat move his tail (only one direction, but this is good for posing nonetheless). Pros and Cons:

Pros:

-Shark can open mouth

-Three models in one

-Love the X-Pod container

-Glow-in-the-dark pieces

Cons:

-None

Overall
5/5.  Good little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-25T19:47:24.187Z","Three models!","This is a great x-pod to build with. The three models are pictured here. 

Fish-My favorite of the three, it has a pose-able jaw, fins, and tail. It is fun to play with and pose. 

Hammerhead shark-Not as pose-able as the fish, but is good to display.

Whale-As pictured here, it can catapult pieces. Also has a pose-able tail. Very well designed.

Fusion with Arachno pod-Very interesting. Looks like a big bug with teeth. It has pose-able teeth.

In all, a cool x-pod. I recommend this to people who like displaying creatures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
