"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-14T08:25:59.39Z","Man do I miss it.","This was the other X-Pod that I gave my little brother. Like the Wild Pod, it ended up in the LEGO box.  I remember it being a very playable set, though, with lots of alternate models.

Pros:

-Alternate models

-X-Pod canister

-Pieces

Cons:

-None

Overall
5/5.  Great set, see if you can get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
