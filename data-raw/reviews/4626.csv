AND you get comics.

The included software is extremely prone to crashing and the pieces are nothing special. What's worst of all, you can't build anything worthwhile with the pieces. I mean, come on! Lego can do better than a multi-colored airplane. So, subscribing to Brickmaster is a bad idea, since you can get the magazine for free and you can buy the sets at a store.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
