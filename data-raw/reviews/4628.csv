"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-23T20:10:27Z","Wow!","  It was weird, my aunt and uncle bust into my room with this set and gave it to me for no paticular reason.  I thanked them and in a jiffy I had it built and ready to play with.  It is actually bigger than it looks.  I think that this is an awesome set and all racing fans should get it.  Definetly a 10 out of 10.  :) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-24T04:19:41Z","Totally rubbish","I tought Lego was in the right path (creativity, limitless building options) with the new technic line, designer sets, world city line and trains. But this Enzo Ferrari set ruined everything in my opinion. As you can see in the photo there are lots of special parts designed for this model(air intakes, fenders, front parts of the car).Usage of these parts are limited. I wonder what else you can build with this set? It's only one step forward from the Mega-Blok's Ford GT. ",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-29T23:41:03Z","amazing","In response to flcef..
There are actually fewer new molds on this set than any of the new 2005 models. Many of the pieces are just existing parts used in a very clever manner and in new colors. The fender parts and the air intake parts are actually the only new parts on the set. The angled front pieces are very old in fact. The hood parts have been used on star wars sets for some time now. The windscreen parts are not new either being used on star wars and alpha team sets. Perhaps if you viewed it more closley you see that this is an amazing set and a great step forward for lego.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T21:05:56Z","A-Mazing","I was scaird  that lego had blown it. Since harry potter stuff, I have not consumed very many conventional LEGO sets just bulk brick sets. I think this shows that LEGO can still do it. I think that the ones among us who believe otherwise are wrong. I was a LEGO Master Builder finalist and I know what can be built with conventional LEGO bricks. This has some exceptions to the standard brick but most parts have been around longer then you would know. So pleas, do all needed research before insulting such a beautiful model.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-02T16:06:10Z","good set... might be able to do lots with it","This is one very good set. I am not sure if it has an interior, or anything special, but it looks pretty good. Quite realistic. I'm not a real fan of Ferraris, so in my opinion, i seem to like this lego version better than the real. Its a good thing that there seems to be a good number of bulk bricks, so i guess there are other models you can make from your imagination. I like the windshield, very clever with taking normal pieces and making them transparent to make a windshield. I hope to get this soon.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-03T02:15:08Z","Ehhh","Haven't seen it in person (much less built it), but this seems like a step in the wrong direction with Lego if they're building a product line around Ferrari.  I have the 1:10 F1 Ferrari set, which was very nice to build and is quite realistic within the limitations of the Technic parts, but the Enzo looks more child-oriented and lacking in detail.  I would hope this to be a fluke set, to be revised later in a much bigger and smoother-detailed set.  Also, I'd love to get the larger F1 car soon...the one with working suspension :)",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T15:47:09Z","Lego is Lost!","Now I'm defendly sure, lego has going down a road, and in my opinion a really bad road. Where's the time that you made wierd constructions, and then came to genius solutions with the parts you had? Nowdays lego seems to take a picture, make an few (big, large and not much useable) new pieces and bring it out of a set. Lego is going much the way of playmobile. And I think that is sad. This set rpoofs it. Its ugly, too many big parts and new parts, not much fun of building in this one! 
very sad...
it could be much much better...",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T08:09:48Z","Molto bello","It seems with this set you either love it or hate it depending on your personal viewpoint and how far you feel Lego should go in making custom parts. I think there is actually only one custom part in this set that has not appeared before the 6 used to make the fenders. I also enjoy the challenge of thinking of how to use normal parts to achieve a particular shape, but equally I do not have a problem with custom parts if they are there – especially where you have to build them up to create the whole as here. A large one-piece custom brick would have been much worse in my view. 

I have to say I am one of the ones who loves this set.  What has been done here is very ingenious - using (virtually all) existing bricks to create an accurate replica of the prototype. Anyone who sees this should be impressed with the finished product. For me part of the rating must also be whether you enjoy building the set. I enjoyed building this immensely. It is made much easier with the 3 bags of bricks in 3 stages – which is better than older sets - having to sift through hundreds of parts at a time. The set was as big as I expected, but the box was larger. I did feel (unusually for me) that at &#163;30 GBP for 477 pieces it was also value for money. No one else seems to have mentioned it but you do get instructions to make another very accurate replica of a Ferrari F333 SP from the same parts – again very ingenious. The Lego designers should be congratulated all round.

There are still anomalies like why a blue 6 x 8 plate on the bottom of the car where all the others are black? I have replaced mine and it does look better all black. Also we still have to add some stickers, but thankfully some bricks are printed – which is always preferred.

Overall this is in my top 3 (not including SW UCS) sets for accuracy, enjoyment of building and value for money - the others are the Star Wars AT – AT and Fokker DR1 Triplane – sold as Red Barron.  New 10133 BNSF GP – 38 loco is not bad either.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-12T14:55:42Z","F333 SP is pretty good too","
Having being impressed with the Enzo – which I have slightly modified since my previous review to make it look even better, I decided to buy the set again so I could make the F333 SP without having to dismantle my Enzo. As I said before the fact that these 2 very accurate replicas can be made from the same parts is a credit to the Lego designers. Often we see alternative models that can be made from a set shown on the back of the box without the instructions of how to make them, and, it has to be said, I often wonder what they are supposed to be anyway. Not so here - this is a proper alternative model with full instructions and separate stickers. The build is not so easy as the Enzo, as the parts are not in the 1, 2, 3 bag sequence as before – presumably as it is assumed most people will be using their dismantled Enzo for the parts and they will already be mixed up. The build is similarly ingenious to the Enzo, but it does not quite use all the parts so there will be some left over. There is no engine to make this time. The finished car is larger than the Enzo  - 1: 16 rather than the 1: 17 of the Enzo, but again compares vary favourably to the prototype. Again I have added a few additional finishing touches, but even without these it rates another maximum score. The set overall for being able to make accurate replicas of both cars must be one of the best ever - even if it does contain the odd custom part.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T06:06:55Z","Wonderful set.","I'll try to give a honest opinion. 

The model is an accurate rendition of the Enzo. Sure, you'll never be able to render those round, smooth curves with square bricks, but the lego designers did a perfect job on making the model as accurate and recogniseable as can be. Bonus points also for including a second model, the F333 SP. It's constructed with just as much care and accuracy as the main model. Both cars are also very sturdy, you'd really have to play it rough to damage it.

In relation to the earlier reviews posted below, I'd like to clear some things up; 
-There is only ONE custom part in this set, the front wheelarches. The rest are your standard lego bricks and pieces, which also makes this a great parts pack to get plenty of good bricks in red.
-I also have an aversion to stickers, but here they are only used where no other solution was available. For example, take the Ferrari logo on the 'nose', you can't get it there with printing. The headlight bricks and the vents on the front (circular parts) are printed.
So far, the stickers show no sign of coming off, and applied with a little precision you won't even notice it's not printed. 

The only thing that's a bit of a bummer for me is the steering wheel, which is just a technic gear. I think the model team steering wheel would've done a better job.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T15:56:18Z","Model Team is Back!","The finished Enzo looks absolutely fantastic.  Although this set is not technically a Model Team set, it certainly has the look and feel of the glory days of Model Team in the mid 1990s. Overall, it is a very good medium size set.

Highs
1. Playability.
2. Accurate and sleek design.
3. Lots of red bricks.
4. Silver button bricks.
5. Excellent use of black grooved 1 by 2s for air intakes.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-27T22:10:11Z","Sure to become a classic","This set is built in the fashion of Model Team, with smooth bricks, curved bricks, and little details to render the car accurately. A superb kit, and as said before, kudos to Lego designers to get two cars out one set. 
      I wouldn't normaly do this, as I try to just review sets with out cutting other's reviews down, but on this one, two others on this set's review list think that Lego shouldn't be putting out &quot;custom&quot; bricks. Well I have this to say- if Kirk Christiansen hadn't bought a injection moulding machine in 1947, we wouldn't have the Lego we know today. You see, part of a company's sucess is it's ability to evolve- even if it means doing something never done before. So if you want to build with &quot;true Lego&quot; or &quot;classic Lego&quot; or whatever you want to call them- buy Creator bulk brick buckets, or go to an online auction site, but Lego fans really need to appreciate where we have been- and embrace new ideas. By the way- I own two of these sets. I personally love the new arch pieces and hope to see them used in another set real soon.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-11T01:58:47Z","New parts? Not many","I don't see what all the fuss is about. The only new parts that I know of are the fenders. the others parts have been cleverly used and makes a great model overall. You have to build it yourself, not look at the box itself. The interior is very well made and the only complaint is the stickers",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Brock_the_Builder","2008-04-28T21:29:59.217Z","I enjoyed the build and the finished product.  Great entry set for Lego Racers.","This was my 1st time building a Lego Racers set.  I had read the reviews posted here before purchase, and I was uncertain whether I would actually like this genre.  I am big fan of Town sets.  I am also in love with the Creator line, which is awesome!

Due to my uncertainty, I picked up a set on ebay for pretty cheap ($22 total).  I enjoyed the build, and I found the combination of Technic bricks and spindles mixed with traditional bricks interesting.  The finished product is a little rigid looking, but not bad at all.  Several visitors to my home even said it looked cool!

I read other's complaints about stickers and specialized parts. I made my own solution to the stickers-- I didn't use any!  If I do put 1, it will be the Ferrari logo on the engine block.  The car looks better without any stickers IMO.  As for special parts, etc, I found that with the exception of some fender pieces, the car is almost all traditional technic and regular brick pieces.  So, I dunno what all the fuss is about?

My main complaints are the the lack of detailed and accesible interior (you have to pop the windshield bricks-- to see nothing) and the fact that the hood is on a hinge, but does not open due to the windshield.  For these two reasons, I give it a 4.
I just picked up the F430 Spider NIB for $25 today.  The FXX is next for me. I dunno about the '430 Challenge'?  Maybe if I can find it cheap...  

But this Enzo is good place to start!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
