I would not have bought this set, but it came in my Brickmaster subscription, so I built it just in case.  The only other pro besides the spinner is the blade-like weapon bit.

"hedgehog_lover","2008-08-26T05:31:10.543Z","The not quite grown up rakshi","Well then, to start off I shall mention the fact that the Rotuca Spinner is a good playability function even though it can get in the way and the cord makes the set look ugly when it's in. I would personally have liked the rahaga to go with the rakshi like the bohrok va went with the bohrok but oh well. I also found out that all the rahaga must lean on their staff to stand up. Now to the pros and cons.
PROS-
Looks like a mini rakshi
Nice little staff
rotuca spinner
CONS-
Looks ugly with rotuca cord in
Blue colour could be better
Buy if-errm,you like the rahaga
don't buy if-you like big sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-12T15:51:37.687Z","Like other Rahaga","I Think that Gaaki is just like all other Rahaga. With some cool pieces, The Gaaki's Color is not the best that the blue can be, but i really like to use it. The Spinner is another option to have fun with the rahaga, and the Guurahk's Staff is a great piece to use. I Just think that the rahaga don't have much differences, i rate Gaaki 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-20T12:44:40.03Z","No studs included.","I was never a fan of Bionicle because they don't use any studded bricks but I love mechas and this one seems to fit in nicely with its color scheme. The twin-tipped spear looks awesome and the rotuca spinner is great! Although spinning the thing is a habit once its in your hands, try not to do it in a room full of objects as it may be easy to lose if you've forgotten your glasses..",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-02T12:18:45.2Z","Great Companion to Nokama","I know a lot of you guys out there think Gaaki stinks, but I think that '05 wouldn't have been complete without the Rahaga.  Gaaki's tool is the double-pronged one from Guurahk.  Her spinner, like all of them, go way high, even though they're rather inaccurate.  Her face is a darker blue version of Guurahk's.  The eyes are kinda too far back in the head, but you can see them as they are bright orange.

Pros:

-Goes with Nokama good

-Reused Guurahk staff

-Spinner

-Orange eyes

-Articulating arms and legs

Cons:

-Eyes are positioned a little too far back in the head

So if you have Nokama, get Gaaki.  If you have Gaaki, get Nokama!!  Happy building!! :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"1_for_Legos","2008-12-15T16:59:02.89Z","Okay.","This was my first bionicle, i got it from Brick master 05. I really like the staff and the disk spinner.

Pros.

rakshi mask

spinner 

staff thing

Cons.

legs and arms are hardly posable

needs staff to stand.

An o.k. set.

"Kalhiki","2009-11-22T17:31:42.467Z","Wow, that staff looks big in the pic.","First off, not very poseable (I still don't know if that's correct spelling). Basically it's a miniturized Guurahk. The head can surn from side-to side. The leg movement depends on how you connect the waist. Forward-can't move back. Down- The legs will have to be sticking out. The arms have a bit more range, but if bothe hands are on the staff, it can't move that much. She also has the Rhotuka launch on her back which is probably the best launcher (incredible heighth and distance).
Overall, good. The lack of poseability in the limbs marks this figure (and the other Rahaga) down. Just a note: I'm not doing the other Rahaga unless I have time. I find it pointless to do 6 reviews of figures that are basically the same. Really, If your going to get one it'll either be for storyline reasons or color. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-12T11:33:11.277Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Rahaga) - Rahaga Gaaki Review","<p>This is a good little figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has two pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 28 pieces which is the same amount of pieces we've used to have in the other Rahaga figures. This figure was 4 USD and had a price per piece ratio of 14 cents per piece when it was on sale which may be a little bit high but it's still worth the money.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4868-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. On the back of this figure is a spinner which you can launch very easily. The spinner flies very well, too. On one hand we can also see a nice looking staff. I really can't complain much about this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Nmfrey23","2021-12-27T21:42:18.043Z","The Rahaga are... not the best","<p>The Rahaga are meant to be the small sets from the year 2005. Their builds are nearly identical to one and other, and they aren&#39;t that good. Gaaki&#39;s only difference from the rest of the rahaga are the colours she uses, and her staff piece.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>.Rahkshi head and Bohrok Feet&nbsp;in dark blue</p>

<p>.Rhotuka spinners</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>.Bad stability</p>

<p>.Due to the pre-bent knees, the Rahaga are permanently bowlegged&nbsp;</p>

<p>.Rhotuka spinners are hard to aim because of clunky build and bad movement</p>

<p>.Head only moves side-to-side and looks very hollow</p>

<p>.No new parts except spinners</p>

<p>Overall, this is a&nbsp;purely OK small set. 2/5</p>
