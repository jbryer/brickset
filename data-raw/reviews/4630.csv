"Errex","2007-03-27T11:32:44.86Z","Cheap/Nice little distraction","All Rahaga are virtually identical, the only differences being the head of the weapon each one carries and the color of the non-grey/black pieces.

These sets are very straightforward to build, and the rothuka launcher works fairly well. The combiner models are rather interesting, but since all the pieces are the same amongst all rahaga, the combiner designs tend to be rather repetitive.

These Rahaga are fairly cheap, and as extra parts alone, they are very well worth the money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-07-26T11:31:22.863Z","Hordika Army I","Well all six of these dudes are the same except for weapon head and colour. The are very small but I think it adds to the evil look of them. Small, fast and deadly.

These make an excellent addition to the Rahkshi forces and help them build a new army after the Bohrok were wiped out.

The spinners. Probably the best launcher so far only because i can make them hover on my roof for 5 - 10 seconds before the fall. The worst to actually try and hit an enemy. It's really hard to judge how much force to but into the rip and the slightest bit off will equal miles off target. Excellent for a goal scoring game outside, but that's about it.

Despite the spinners i love em and rank them in at an 8/10 as the spinners dont matter in display and you dont really want to use them in play.

I would recommend getting them all as they are small cheap and fun. also another great stocking filler or small gift.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2008-12-01T14:03:52.327Z","The strange miniture Rakshi","To start, let me say that this set is not that different from the other rahaga.The only difference being that it is a different colour with a different staff. Its build is similar to the 2006 (the piraka)matoran as it has a hunchback shape. It has a staff that is like a version of the brown rakshis staff split in half. The rotoka spinner needs some practice but also the rahaga has to bend forwars to attack something with the pinner. Now the pros and cons.
Pros-
price
looks good with the rakshi
rotuka spinner
saff
Cons-
bit plain
not much differen from other rahaga",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-07T18:58:50.78Z","Great, for a rahaga.","Pouks looks like all rahaga, changing the color and the staff. I was searching for the staff, and the spinner have another special color, brown. The head is a problem to remove it again. But, the coolest things are the staff, colors and combinations. The brown overs in a time, and now, if you don't have  brown sets, you can begin with this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I probaly got it for four dollars or so!  I am pretty sure I had a battle with my other Bionicles when I got home!  I also know for sure that I had alot of battles with him later on!

"Zatth","2013-04-22T15:59:49.353Z","Pouks hunts only the largest land Rahi!","<p>Pouks is very similar to the other Rahaga sets - in fact, his build is identical. The only differences are his color (a fine shade of brown) and the tip of his staff - which is identical to that of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8587-1"">#8587 Rahkshi Panrahk</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some consider this a con - much like the Bohrok and several other Bionicle product lines, the sets are almost clones of each other. Don't let this deter you, however - Pouks is a great little set, as are all the Rahaga. <br></p><p>If you are interested in the storyline, he becomes all the more fun: in the storyline, Pouks has a unique personality (outspoken and quick to act, but cheerful and active - he hunts, captures, and protects the largest land Rahi) and special powers (his spinner behaves like a bolas, wrapping around the feet of the target, while his staff can leave an invisible mark on any target. The mark can only be seen by Pouks, and helps him track Rahi) which make him distinct from the other Rahaga, and add to his play value. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Brown pieces (true brown is not too common these days!)<br></li><li>Nice weapon (the staff head matches him nicely)<br></li><li>Rhotuka Spinner (collectable and flies very high and far!)</li><li>His small size makes him a nice pocket model (if you remove the spinner)</li><li>Cheap - he's a great deal for your money!<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Identical to the other Rahaga in build (although this isn't always a bad thing)<br></li><li>Poor articulation (his arms and legs are a bit short, and his head can only swivel from side to side, not up and down)<br></li><li>Rhotuka Spinner (you have to pull the pulley very hard to launch it properly - it's also not accurate at all)<br></li></ul>
<p>All things considered, Pouks is a worthy set to add to your collection. You can find him and the other Rahaga on secondhand sites, such as Bricklink and Ebay, for very cheap (I bought my copy on Bricklink for only 2.80 USD!).&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you're interested in the story, or are just looking for a fun, small set, Pouks is worth it! <br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"flarefish","2014-11-27T07:22:50.18Z","Awesome spinner creature!","<p>I really like this cool set. I did not buy this set in a box but found the correct&nbsp;pieces in a box full of pieces. The main thing I really like about this set is how the spinner could be a weapon, a helicopter or a sort of shield. It is really fun to shoot the spinner around the house and if you tell a friend&nbsp;to bring another type of Rahaga&nbsp;you could play this game... Stand up 2 sets of 5 bionicles and try and shoot each down in 3 shots, TRY IT. OK, building this set was easy but not really that fun and it has a quite basic body and shape which does sort of take away from the actual fun you can have with this set. Another thing that some people may like or dislike&nbsp;is the fact its head will wobble&nbsp;meaning its good for posing it easily but hard to do stop motion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>epic spinner.</p>

<p>spinner could be used as something else.</p>

<p>easy to build.</p>

<p>cute desktop toy.</p>

<p>easy to pose.</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>head wobbles to easily.</p>

<p>boring&nbsp;to build.</p>
