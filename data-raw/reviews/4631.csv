"Blade","2007-07-26T11:35:23.3Z","Hordika Army III","Well all six of these dudes are the same except for weapon head and colour. The are very small but I think it adds to the evil look of them. Small, fast and deadly.

These make an excellent addition to the Rahkshi forces and help them build a new army after the Bohrok were wiped out.

The spinners. Probably the best launcher so far only because i can make them hover on my roof for 5 - 10 seconds before the fall. The worst to actually try and hit an enemy. It's really hard to judge how much force to but into the rip and the slightest bit off will equal miles off target. Excellent for a goal scoring game outside, but that's about it.

Despite the spinners i love em and rank them in at an 8/10 as the spinners dont matter in display and you dont really want to use them in play.

I would recommend getting them all as they are small cheap and fun. also another great stocking filler or small gift.

Although I love these pictures I noticed this one's staff is in the wrong hand :P",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the playability and the launch spinner option. The rahaga don't have the Rahkshi color and can be a problem to increase the Rahkshi. Principally by the similarity with the other rahaga, i rate 4/5 ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-13T11:08:29.337Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Rahaga) - Rahaga Kualus Review","<p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set includes 28 pieces. When it was on sale it was 4 USD and it had a price per piece ratio of 14 cents per piece. For a little figure it may be a little bit high but it's still worth the money.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4870-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head can be adjusted. On the back we can see a very nice looking spinner which flies very well. Kualus also has a staff on one of his hands which has a nice design. I really can't complain about this figure - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
