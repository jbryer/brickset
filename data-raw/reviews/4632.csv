These make an excellent addition to the Rahkshi forces and help them build a new army after the Bohrok were wiped out.

The spinners. Probably the best launcher so far only because i can make them hover on my roof for 5 - 10 seconds before the fall. The worst to actually try and hit an enemy. It's really hard to judge how much force to but into the rip and the slightest bit off will equal miles off target. Excellent for a goal scoring game outside, but that's about it.

Despite the spinners i love em and rank them in at an 8/10 as the spinners dont matter in display and you dont really want to use them in play.

I would recommend getting them all as they are small cheap and fun. also another great stocking filler or small gift.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

But i think too that diferent sets are better, because using pieces to upgrade these they are looking more diferent, ever. Norik have the same staff of the red rahkshi, and the spinner color, red, is good too. But i rate it 4/5, no 5/5 like iruini because the spinner, it don't have a special color, like gold.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-12T11:25:15.737Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Rahaga) - Rahaga Norik Review","<p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This figure has 28 pieces and it was 4 USD when it came out. That means that the price per piece ratio was about 14 cents per piece. It may be a little bit too high for a small figure like this but I think it's still worth the money.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4877-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head of this figure can be moved and the spinner is able to fly very well, too. One one hand we can also see a nice looking staff. I really can't complain much about this set - even if it doesn't do much.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
