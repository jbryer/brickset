"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-06-24T12:57:17.56Z","Basics of Bomonga","The small sets were never a big attractor of attention for me, but the Rahaga looked decent, and they turned out all right (despite my initial reaction of hating them).

The box is your typical box for small set. The front of the box displays Bomonga, and the back of the box displays the Rhotuka feature, and has a Kanoka club code.

There are no new pieces in this set, with the exception of the Rhotuka components. In Bomonga's case, not even the head is recolored (with four other Rahaga heads different colors). The heads are made out of a different plastic than the original Rahkshi heads, though. The new pieces are the Rhotuka components. There is a gray base piece that uses a size 3 +rod to attach to the set, a yellow piece the Rhotuka sits on, and a gray ripcord that is used to launch the Rhotuka. More on that later.

The build for this set was pretty neat. When I first saw these sets, I had no idea how how the Rahkshi heads were able to move back and forth, and building the set finally allowed me to see it. Other than that, it's a pretty straightforward build, with most of it (all the limbs, Rhotuka launcher, and neck) attaching to a simple plus rod.

This set is definitely fun to play with, but a bit awkward to pose. The main part for playability is the Rhotuka. When you pull the ripcord (you insert it into a slot on the gray launcher piece), that thing goes flying even farther and higher than the Kanoka. And it doesn't care where it goes, so be careful. I do not recommend playing with these outside.

So this is overall a pretty good set. The only thing about this set is that, while it can pose, it doesn't pose great, and lacks a bit in the piece originality section. So it gets about a four out of five.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2007-10-09T08:52:19.593Z","Hordika Army IV","Well all six of these dudes are the same except for weapon head and colour. The are very small but I think it adds to the evil look of them. Small, fast and deadly.

These make an excellent addition to the Rahkshi forces and help them build a new army after the Bohrok were wiped out. This is the black one of the series, with a claw like weapon head that kind of reminds me of the jaws of life. He has the best colour scheme out of all six, in my opinion, the black on grey then the orange, especially in they eyes, so cool.

The spinners. Probably the best launcher so far only because i can make them hover on my roof for 5 - 10 seconds before the fall. The worst to actually try and hit an enemy. It's really hard to judge how much force to but into the rip and the slightest bit off will equal miles off target. Excellent for a goal scoring game outside, but that's about it.

Despite the spinners i love em and rank them in at an 8/10 as the spinners dont matter in display and you dont really want to use them in play.

I would recommend getting them all as they are small cheap and fun. also another great stocking filler or small gift.

Although I love these pictures I noticed this disk is black and it should be grey. :P",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The pieces too included with the black rahkshi are the staff and the head, changing only the color scheme. The spinner don't have a special color, but black features are cool, like the hands.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has 28 pieces and when it was on sale it was 4 USD. The price per piece ratio was 14 cents per piece. It may be a little bit high for a figure like this but it's still worth the money.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to complain about stickers.<br></p>
