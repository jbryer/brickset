"A_Brickset_user","2007-03-16T21:05:52.763Z","Good Job for a Small Set","Normally, the smaller sets are not my favorite, but I really enjoyed the Rahaga (All, not just Iruini).

The box is your typical small set box. It comes with a front graphic displaying who else but the set inside. The back of the box displays the Rhotuka feature, and has a Kanoka club code. But other than that, the box is just that - a box. 

There are no new shapes of pieces for this set, with the exception of the Rhotuka components. Some are just recolored versions of past parts, like Iruini's head. The new pieces are the Rhotuka components. There is: A gray base that uses a size 3 +rod to attack to the set, a yellow piece the Rhotuka sits on, and a gray ripcord that spins the yellow thing the Rhotuka sits on, and launches it. More on that later.

The build for this set was pretty neat. When I first saw these sets, I was stumped on how the Rahkshi heads were able to move back and forth, and building the set finally allowed me to see it. Yes, I thought it was interesting, yes I am easily entertained. :)

This set is pretty fun to play with, although posing is a bit hard. The main part for playability is the Rhotuka. When you pull the ripcord, that thing goes flying. And it doesn't care where it goes, so be careful. I do not recommend playing with these outside. One pull of the ripcord is all you will get before it flies off and over the rainbow.

So this is overall a pretty good set. The only thing about this set is that it's somewhat hard to pose, and lacks a bit in the piece originality section. So it gets about a four out of five. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-09T09:00:09.7Z","Hordika Army V","Well all six of these dudes are the same except for weapon head and colour. The are very small but I think it adds to the evil look of them. Small, fast and deadly.

These make an excellent addition to the Rahkshi forces and help them build a new army after the Bohrok were wiped out. This guy is the green one of the series and as such has the green Rahkshi weapon, the two pronged staff that reminds me of something from an old cartoon science lab or horror movie, but is by far the best weapon for speed. Stab or blast an enemy Toa, this staff has it all.

The spinners. Probably the best launcher so far only because i can make them hover on my roof for 5 - 10 seconds before the fall. The worst to actually try and hit an enemy. It's really hard to judge how much force to but into the rip and the slightest bit off will equal miles off target. Excellent for a goal scoring game outside, but that's about it.

Despite the spinners i love em and rank them in at an 8/10 as the spinners dont matter in display and you dont really want to use them in play.

I would recommend getting them all as they are small cheap and fun. also another great stocking filler or small gift.

"saberbreaker","2007-09-29T15:35:04.45Z","great","i give this set a 5 because of how fun it is to launch the rohtuka its got great little peices for mocing and stuff but it lacks poseability and the rohtuka is hard to aim but i wish i got the rest of them",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-31T17:09:20.64Z","Like all rahaga, it is very good to make creations.","The title says all. Bionicles like rahaga are too similar. They have the same pieces,with colors, and weapons differents. But it aren't a bad thing, because it are maded to mix, upgrade and create own creations. The spinner gold colored are so cool, maded to like the hagah colors.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-07-24T15:11:05.39Z","Nice small set","I used to be a really big Bionicles fan, and so I got alot of them. I honestly don't think the spinners were one of legos better ideas. You don't have much control over where they go. Iruini looks pretty cool, and besides the spinner, this is a fun and cool set. It comes with some pieces for Bionicles. These were very cheap, so you could collect all of the different colored Rahaga. This is an easy build, it's sturdy, and I'd recommend it to Lego fans of all ages. I give it a 4/5 because of the weird spinner.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"exo_force_fan200","2008-10-11T13:50:17.25Z","Nice Staff","Pros: Staff (Rakeshi Lerhak staff of poison)
          Rhotuka spinner (note: Rhotuka means spinner, so when I say Rhotuka spinner, I'm actually saying spinner spinner)
          Due to the fact this was released in 2005, it is currently rare.

Cons: none

Note:For those of you that can't read matoran, the spinner says B1NN03",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-11T12:58:29.46Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Rahaga) - Rahaga Iruini Review","<p>This is a nice little figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This figure only has 28 pieces. When it was on sale it was 4 USD and the price per piece ratio was 14 cents per piece which may be a little bit high but this figure is still worth the money.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to complain about.<br></p>
