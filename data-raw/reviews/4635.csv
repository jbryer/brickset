It can be a problem, but it is good to have combinations, like of he and whenua, one of the best combinations. The claws looks very a fire weapon, and the mask, very a beast. The right arm have gear system, and the body was maked to launch spinner set. Good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:37:19.733Z","Looks like a lion (sort of)","I wasn't that fussed on Toa Metru Vakama, but Hordiak Vakama is awesome. The faces of all Hordika are great for Rahi MOCs, and the Rhotuka spinner is one of the best projectile weapons Bionicle designers have made.

Pros:
Hordika chest-plate
Rhotuka spinner
Nice colours
Hordika feet
Cool weapons
Mask looks sort of like a lion
Hordika limbs
Swivelling arm mechanism
Nice build

Cons:
Rhotuka spinners are easily lost

But if you can use the Rhotuka spinner properly (DAD!) then the Rhotuka spinners can't get lost. All the Hordika are cool except Nokama, so they are a must have Bionicle subtheme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 29 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 48 pieces and it was 9 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 19 cents per piece which is a good value for a figure like this.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8736-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. On both hands we can see a torch and on one arm we can also see a gear which you can use to move that arm up and/or down. On the back of the torso is a spinner which flies very well, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The fire swords are the single best thing in this set except for the<br></li><li>-Epic Rhotuka spinner, which works fascinatingly well for its size, very aerodynamic design.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-I like the mask, but it's just horrible since it's attached the way it is without a mask holder.<br></li><li>-I also find the overall build of every Hordika very similar, boring.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is truly an amazing one, and will be hunted down by fans everywhere. I highly recommend this, but don't buy all of the Hordika.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
