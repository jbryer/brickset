The weapons characteristics are the same, have two colors, the set color and a normally silver. Other similarity is the spinner, all silver. The eyes are orange, a great color. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-16T18:07:50.653Z","Not worthy of the name Nokama","I'll get straight to the point: I do not like this Bionicle at all. I used to like blue Bionicles and after Nokama Hordika left the shelves of Moore Wilsons I started liking them again. 

Pros:
Good chest-plate
Rhotuka
Arm swivel mechanism
Feet

Cons:
Weapons are just plain weird
Mask doesn't look like it ever was a true Toa or if it ever wants to be one again
Left arm is extremely old

This review is kinda harsh but these cons are bad. 2/5 Nokama Hordika.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-02T09:30:28.187Z","Great Weapons!!","Toa Nokama is my favorite Toa Hordika, especially as she is my only one.  I got her because the weapons are so cool and because I've always been partial to blue Bionicles with orange eyes (Gahlok, Boggarak, etc.).  I got Boggarak along with her.  Anyway, Nokama's color scheme is very cool, consisting of blue, orange, and silver.  The weapons are blue, but the silver part is rubber, so you can bend it around.  Nokama's mask is neat, and  the spinner, like any 2005 spinner, goes really high into the air.  The knee plates are the same as the Toa Metru, but are silver.  5/5, great set.

Pros:

-Blue, orange and silver color scheme

-Mask is neat looking

-Weapons

-Spinner goes way up

Cons:

-Kind of a clone

Please get this set!!  You'll be glad you took my advice!!  :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2010-01-17T12:29:14.297Z","C'mon Carl, this Toa is VERY good!","I was bewildered to see this Toa had a low rating, so I decided to put things right! This Toa features a Rhotuka spinner, twin ""fin barbs"", and a special right arm! The right lower arm is connected to the upper arm via a half pin/half axle connector, and a gear turns the lower arm up and down! This special arm features in every Toa Hordika! Onto the pros and cons:

Pros

The spinner flies VERY far
Cool weapons
Cool mask

Cons

None!

Overall, a set NOT worthy of a 2!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"NickBrick","2010-11-16T14:09:04.527Z","More like 4 and a half","<p>How could anyone give this set a 2/5 ? I got this set used so it did not have the rhotuka spinner. But the axes are great and look like ninja weapons. Nokama's mask is her face which I did not like. The gear function works great and is currently my favorite Bionicle gear function.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 48 pieces and it was 9 USD when it was on 
sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was 19 cents per piece 
which is a good value for a set like this.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8737-1.jpg[/img]</span><br></span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The
 arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On 
both hands we can see a weapon and on one arm we can also see a gear 
which you can use to adjust that arm up and/or down. On the back of the 
torso is a spinner which flies very well, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-This Hordika has the most amazing water axes ever, and are awesome down to the little spikes.<br></li><li>-The Rhotuka spinners, when proplerly launched, work amazingly, maybe a bit too far, though.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The new masks look cool, but aren't my thing.<br></li><li>-Take off a couple of pieces and colors, and the whole body looks exactly the same as the one in any other Hordika set. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is really cool, and is a star because of the spinners and the weapons, but armor is done too horrendously to be considered great. Buy it, but only if you have 1 or none of these. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
