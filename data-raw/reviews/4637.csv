<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The weapons make him out to be almost like a miner.<br></li><li>-The Rhotuka spinner is really a true stroke of genius, and works perfectly.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The whole body looks almost the same as all of the other Toa Hordika.<br></li><li>-The mask makes Whenua almost look like a puppy.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is great in terms of color and design, but is a bit bland when next to all of the Hordika, as do the rest. Buy it, but only if you have about one or two other Hordika.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"ArchOnua85","2021-10-30T01:11:46.68Z","Back To Work","<p>Considering I bought this one along Rorzakh (which I finally gave it a proper review), it would be a no brainer&nbsp;to review this one.</p>

<p>I am not going to touch on the assembly and parts because as mentioned in my Rorzakh review, besides&nbsp;some exceptions, they typically are more the same. What is now worthy of discussion is the aesthetic, which is different from the other Hordikas despite being identical as first glance. Chiefly in the melee weapons, which are rather unusual for its&nbsp;context. Normally, bladed weapons would be the instant choice in a city overrun by Visoraks, but Whenua being Whenua, his element grants him some blunt-like weapons, which sounds odd at first glance. However,&nbsp;you could argue Whenua&#39;s weapons were handy for opening tunnels, which is a very viable way to punch your way through what would reverse the Visoraks.</p>

<p>Playability is more of the same, but the projectile is definitively even better than the Vahkis. In fact, this style of projectile probably has the best range of any Bionicle sets so far, though there is the Mistika that might be a good contender. Seriously, I should get an&nbsp;Onua Mistika.</p>

<p>The value is similar due to being a pre-2015 set, although for some reasons, the Visoraks are more expensive than the Hordikas according to the Brickset database. So if you value your currency, the Hordikas are a decent choice.</p>

<p>Overall, a worthy addition to your Bionicle addition and unlike Vakhis and Visoraks in particular, definitively own more than 1. Ideally Whenua and another Hordika of your choice.</p>

"ZGMFToddD","2017-06-30T11:50:21.24Z","Whenua, Hordika of Earth","<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The Canister is real nice (I like most of them). I like how you can use the lid to play ring toss, Bionicle Style (take a bit of practice Though!). Overall design is good, largely the same as a Visorak&#39;s but a different lid.</p>

<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>

<p>1 less than his previous incarnation (not that i mind). Nice selection od parts, especially the body, chest plate, head, right arm &amp;&nbsp;thumpers (all these new pieces for me!). The Black &amp; silver color scheme work well together.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Having got him second hand his is one thing i haven&#39;t yet done myself, How browsing the instructions, the build is standard for canister sets of its time! But i see the build as good!</p>

<p><strong>The Figure</strong></p>

<p>Overall pleasing esthetic. Like all other Hordika, a clone build only difference been color, head &amp; tools. Rhotuka works well. The thumpers gimmick &amp; cog gimmick in the arm work well. I do find the choice&nbsp;left arm piece&nbsp;a little strange since it sticks out a bit. Would have been nice if Lego made a new arm piece for the left, but taking the budget into consideration i don&#39;t think it would be possible! However this doesn&#39;t serve as a detriment!</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>8738 Toa Hordika Whenua is a Bionicle set worth having in your collection! I heard other people say their not good, but as far as im concerned their all&nbsp;good especially Whenua!</p>

<p>I think Whenua is a good Hordika to start off with. Plus good if you only want one! This is even if you get one 12 years late!</p>
