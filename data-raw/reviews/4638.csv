Onewa Hordika too, the same colors and the claw clubs like very much the proto pitons. The rhotuka spinner is cool to shot, but it flyes very, and can be losted easily. The all Hordika have gears in one arm, and like action figures. I rate Onewa Hordika 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-07T13:53:14.327Z","The best of the Hordika, says I.","Onewa has always been one of my favourite Toa, be he Metru or Hordika. My favourite part of the Hordika version is that it is not too different from the Metu version. His mask is still slightly similar, his eyes are the same colour, and his clubs are very much like the proto-pitons on the Metru version. Also, the Rhotuka spinners have always been my favourite launchers next to the Zamor spheres of 2006.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-07T17:46:07.403Z","Great weapons","Where do I begin??? This guy is bursting with AWESOMENESS! Toa Metru Onewa was my fourth favourite Toa Metru, but Hordika Onewa is my favourite Hordika! Amazing how things change for the better, isn't it?

Pros:
Weapons are awesome
Hordika chest-plate
Hordika limbs
Hordika limbs
Weapons are awesome
Rhotuka spinner
Swivelling arm mechanism
Weapons are awesome
Mask is great
Good set for MOCing
Did I mention that the weapons are awesome?

Cons:
NONE!

Hordika Onewa is awesome and I was sad to see him cured back to Toa Metru in the movie, but that is only a movie. You can always make up the REAL story (in which Hordika Nokama turns evil and gets a Vezon cape and kills Vakama, Nuju and Whenua and it is up to Onewa and Matau to stop her and her 5 Visorak - she kicked the black Visorak of a waterfal where he was eaten by Keetongu)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

 arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On 
both hands we can see a weapon and on one arm we can also see a gear
