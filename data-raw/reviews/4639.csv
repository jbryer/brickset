The mask looks like a poisoned matau, and his weapons like daggers, with also the same green and silver. The spinner can be launched and losted easily due to it's speed when launched. I rate Matau hordika 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-16T18:11:55.327Z","SWEET!","Matau Hordika is one of those Bionicles that is just plain awesome. 

Pros:
Great mask
Arm swiveling mechanism
Cool blades
Rhotuka
Great chest-plate
Feet
Green

Cons:
NONE!

I'm pretty sure everyone knows that nothing is perfect, but Matau Hordika comes really close. Overall he is a really great Bionicle and is a must have for all Bionicle lovers. 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

         Raging cyclone unleashed! The six Toa Metru returned to the city of Metru Nui, intending to save the sleeping Matoran and bring them to their new home. Ambushed by Visorak spiders, the Toa Metru are mutated into Hordika ... half Toa, half beast! Can they overcome their new enemies and their own bestial natures in time to rescue the Matoran? Half Toa, half monster, Matau must decide between saving the Matoran and saving himself. His fang blades can slice through webs and cables, as well as charge up his Rhotuka wind spinner. New feature! Pull the ripcord to send the Rhotuka spinner flying!
Includes instructions to build a Rahi rock raptor with Onua (Brown)! ",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"chavez365","2009-11-08T07:04:09.187Z","Great Set!","Matau is really cool! He has a fantastic Rhotuka Spinner that flies really far and two cool weapons that look like swords. His mask/face is pretty cool, and bears a slight resemblance to the mask he wore as a Toa Metru. His colors are nice, and look dark and intimidating. One of his arms moves if you turn a gear, but unfortunately the other is simply a Toa Mata leg. His chest armor is nice, and he has cool leg armor. Now to the pros and cons.
Pros:
Cool mask/face
Spinner goes really far
Looks good
Weapons are nice
Good armor
One arm moves
Cons:
Other arm doesn`t move
Legs aren`t very good
Spinner gets lost a lot and isn`t accurate
Those three minor flaws are hardly anything compared the the positive traits, and overall, I think this is a very good set. If you have the chance to get it, get it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>This set is really great, and is one of the best and menacing in my collection. I recommend him, Vakama, and Nuju if you want any Hordika.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

 arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. On 
both hands we can see a dagger and on one arm we can also see a gear
