He replied that he doesn't sell his LEGO. Right then and there I knew I met my first AFOL. I went to his house last night and he showed me his ridiculous collection of LEGO sets ranging from the classic white boxed sets to Star Wars sets. Tim gave me this set along with #2537. I had a blast and look forward to showing him my collection.
Now on to the set review.
Even though I am reviewing this set almost 20 years after it was produced, to me it is brand new. I just opened the box and loved the ad that showcased a few of the new sets for 1989. The great thing about LEGO is that it is timeless. If this were a video game from 1989, it would be outdated and unless I have the system the game is played on, it would be worthless as well.
The set itself is a mixture of red, white and black bricks and plates. To my delight, it also includes a piece of string to look like the reins from his sled to the reindeer. The finished model is cute and basic. I think children would love building this set and I will love having it set up during the holiday season.
The set could use updating now. For example, the sleds rails are white and I think they could look more distinct if they were gray or brown. The angled slope bricks are great and serve their purpose beautifully as Santa hats. 
Overall a cute, fun little set. Thank you Tim!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This was alittle more fun to build then the other Santa model which to me just kind of stands there. This set with the attached reindeer and the string used to act as a harness immediately pulled my attention to being able to pull it along and offer a little more play then other sets.</p>

<p>Like many of the other Seasonal Sets, this one is still great for extra pieces it offers up and for displaying at the appropriate season as a decoration.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
