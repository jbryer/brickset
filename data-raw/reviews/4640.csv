The mask isn't symetrical, but have the different eye in the same side of nuju metru. The mask is cool, but short, and maded for the hordika head. He includes a spinner launcher on his back, i really like that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Boidoh","2009-12-07T21:37:02.39Z","THE POWER OF ICE","i ONLY Got this guy because he is ice. i like ice.and i dont really like bionicle so i call this a thing you can admire FROM A DISTANCE for non-bionicle fans.

Pros-
1. THE POWER OF ICE...
2. Rhotuka Launcher (i think)
3. Kanohi Matatu (Mask Of Telekinesis) (i think)
4. Cool Feet
5. If you get Nokama i think its Nakama i dunno but if you get her you can make a Sea Spider Rahi. I already built it without her. All i had to do is ask my friend for his broken pieces. Easy peasy just use Krazy Glue.
6. Cool Hordika Teeth (His Weapons)

PS. I was once bionicle fan so thats how i know so much. Well my knowledge is still here... oooh. just remembered.

7. Hes smart. i think he works in the knowledge towers in Ko-Metru. Well Once Did.

Cons-
Nothing but sometimes the ball joints gets worn out and gets easy to move. Like my friends one. Its almost going to my one now... >:(

Over all this is a excellent set. This is my first and last BIONICLE i have because i suddenly didn't like BIONICLE after a few weeks. This should be your first. Once again ICE..

Great Set... I recommended this to a friend. He bought it and was satisfied.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

	I got this set from my grandparents&#39; friendly neighbors for my birthday one year, and was pleased by this, declaring this one of my favorite Hordika in the collection.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The mask and the weapons are superior pieces.</li>
	<li>
		The Rhotuka spinner is truly a winner here.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		This guy looks too similar to one of his friends, a bit disappointing.</li>
	<li>
		The mask system just looks odd in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This is an awesome set, and one of my favorite Hordika in the entire series. I recommend this, but only get one or two Hordika in your collection.</p>
