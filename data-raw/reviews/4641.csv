Some people complain that the Technic theme is too complicated but if you build the LEGO Technic (Slizer), the LEGO Technic (RoboRiders) and the LEGO BIONICLE sets you won't have that problem anymore. I like the way how LEGO did the headlights with the glow in the dark pieces and I also like the v6 engine on the back. The steering wheel doesn't turn and we also get a slammer which you can use to launch that car. This set is a great built and it's very sturdy as well. We also get a few stickers in this set. I got this set since 2005 or 2006 and the stickers on my set crumble off this car now. :-(<br><br>I still can't complain about this set and it's fun to play with. The car looks good and it is good, too.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
