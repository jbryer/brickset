"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-27T21:19:54Z","Awesome","I got this set as a birthday present and I have to say, it is an awesome set.  I only wish it came with more ice orbs and minifigures.  I think that everyone should get this set because of its endless play ability (it doesn't get to be one of those sets that you regret buying and is just sitting on your shelf collecting dust).  Definently for me, 9/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-11T01:03:34Z","awsome","This is a great set. The head is very cool, made of 3 different window pices, not just one big one. The ogel minion is different too, with some head alterations. There is even a storing place for some extera orbs. Then there is a guy on the hanglider. silple, yet functional. Its fun launching orbs at it. Post Script(P.S.) There are pictures on brickshelf, type in 4774 for those of you who want pictures",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-03T20:14:42Z","The change is coming... Are you ready?","Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. AWEXOME! (yes, AweXome is spelled that way). It CAN TRANSFORM! (I wonder what it's called? NOT initiate ALPHA mode, that's for sure). Flex returnes!

FLEX:

10/10. Me favorite ALPHA TEAM mini-fig. He be orange.

ICE GLIDER:

10/10. Can't transform, but swell anyways.

SCORPION ORB LAUNCHER:

10/10. It is the best Ogel set yet. Including all the other 3 seireis. It can actually launch the Orbs!


OGEL VIPER ESCAPE POD:

9/10. Can't stand up very well, but nonetheless good. It is a robot, I know, but can it fly?

ANYDANGWAYS; A great set.

The change is coming. Are you ready?

"bmwlego","2008-10-05T13:45:33.67Z","Almost Transformer Like LEGO Set","The Alpha Team seems to me like a great LEGO theme with this set being a great example of what one could expect from it. I picked this up shortly after emerging from my Dark Ages at a closeout store for 8 dollars. I didn't want it for the Alpha Team theme at the time, I just wanted it for the parts. What great parts this set is made of. This was my first exposure to the Dark Red color which I have come to love because it is not a primary color such as red, blue or yellow. The black works really well with this color and the set could score a 5 based on color choice alone. There is also Dark Blue that makes up the glider that the Alpha Team member uses to escape the Scorpion Orb Launcher. Again, great choice of color.

The minifigs included are top notch. One black skeleton head attached to a half Dark Red, half black torso and legs (similar to Batman's enemy Two-Face, switch the head with a Two-Face head and you can have a new outfit for Two-Face). The Alpha Team agent looks great too as he has accessories painted onto his torso and zippers on his pants. His face has a beard and he has a knit cap to keep his head warm.

The Scorpion Orb Launcher is an amazing LEGO creation that can walk on 6 legs, stand up on its tail or slither along the floor snake style like in the picture #2 on the front of the box. The tail is fully articulated and the legs and claws are a nice use of Bionicle parts. The head is made up of several cockpit windshields that give it a nice smooth, curved appearance. Excellent and intelligent design all around.

The hang glider is a nice throw in but it is made up of Dark Blue, Trans Orange and Sand Blue parts which is so much better than adding another 10-20 black pieces to your collection that you already have!

Great set from a theme that makes me wish that I was into LEGO when this theme was being produced.

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-24T12:53:56.06Z","HAHAHA!","I got this set several years ago at the Park Royal mall simply because I had money in my pocket that I wanted to get rid of.
The best thing about this set is the mecha-scorpion. Since this is the only Alpha Team set I have that comes with a baddie, I also use him with my Agents sets as the evil Agent Skully. (Fans of the X-files will get it. SKULL-y! Huh? It's funny, believe me.) The scorpion is cool and would work as a set by itself, but it's always nice to have an Alpha Team guy thrown in.

Pros:
Ogel drone (Agent Skully)
skis
mecha-scorpion
orb launcher is neat

Cons:
NONE!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-11-12T22:49:02.82Z","Scorpion Review","<p>This is an older set, I remember picking it up on clearance for my X who has this thing for Scorpions due to them being his Zodiac Sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've kept it... it was mixed in with all the other sets and he didn't ask for it... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's actually a good set, some decent articulation for a robot vehicle. I didn't care too much for the hang glider with it. Any time a small piece or ""mini set"" is included like that, it feels too much like an after thought and Lego wanting to up the brick count so they can ask for more money on the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was never huge on Alpha Team and even if I hadn't bought this on clearance, I think I'd have still wanted to get it for the design.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
