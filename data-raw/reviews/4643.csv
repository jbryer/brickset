"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T17:12:09Z","WHOOOAAAA","I don't know why I got this set but I have to say that it is awesome.  Its transforming action thingy is soooo cool.  Personally I think it looks king of like the TX-130 from the video game Clone Wars from star wars when not in walker mode.  Definetly a 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Awkward comment about shooting himself in the eye.. or well. its still a little funny",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-11T01:08:54Z","NICE!","This is a very functional set, it can transform. I just use this thing as a juggernaught to plow through anything.in the &quot;pontoon baotish&quot; version of course. No shortage of guns and things. even a white rubber torpedo launcher with a seat. Minifigs are good, the agents helmet is cool too. P.S. There are pictures on brickshelf.

this is terrible, too many big pieces and it looks awful
i only hope they go back to what they used to do best many years ago, big towns and BIG space landscapes to build and expand",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-28T20:24:38Z","If its just like the rest....","This is probably a pretty cool set if its like the rest.I hate say it but yes i do have all the other sets.I'm thinking about going out tonight to buy it any way.Umm well the alpha mode look sOOOOO awsome.and it has a new figurine they haven't advertised.ill give it 9-10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Zed Minifigure
Drone Minifigure
Skateboarding Helmet
Insectoid Helmet
Red Kodan Claw
Two Onua Olda claws
Mech Style

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-03T20:05:44Z","I finally got it!","Well, folks, just when you thought I was gone for good, I'M BAAAAACCCCCKKKKKKK!!!!!!! I recently receved this in the mail, and I love it. I would give it a 100/10, if possible. Oh, yeah, and the guy who shot himself in the eye with this, I tis no one's fault but his/her own.

SNOW SCUTTLER:

10/10. ( I gave it a name!))

Okay, Here is the 2nd coolest Ogel vehicle. It helps Ogel after time is frozen.

BLIZZARD BLASTER:

300000/10. I love it. It was in the LEGO magazine comic this 2 months. Zed pilots it. It's purpose is that after Ogel froze time to a stop, and the ALPHA TEAM, this thing was immuned to the time freeze ray, (which, by the way, I made.)

Zed will hopefully save the ALPHA TEAM next comic, but we can't be certain.

ICE SHARK:

1000000000/10. It actually glides on the ground! Awesome! AweXome to the maximum! I especally like the missle launcher. I think it should of come with 2 people to pilot it. Zed and another guy. It needs 2. Maybe the other guy could be called Chill? I don't know.

ZED:

10/10. 2nd favorite ALPHA TEAM MEMBER. (1st favorite is Flex.) I wonder why he don't have no ALPHA TEAM Logo on his shirt?

SKELITON DRONE:

9/10. 1 more would of been nice. They didn't include enough of those thangs in this ALPHA TEAM series, but it still is the best of the 3 types of  ALPHA TEAM series.

ALLS-IN-ALLS:

10/10.

See ya later.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T21:16:24Z","Who is this mysterious Zed?","I got this set today and it is awesome.
Pros:
Zed:
This guy enters into the line mysteriously. But the skateboard helmet is nice on him.9/10
Mini-Snow crawler:
A great mini-vehicle.10/10
Blizzard Blaster:
Awesome. A huge robot that is great for smashing into ogel's lair. I love it.10/10
Ice Shark:
It really glides, so that's neat. Very fast.10/10

"MasterBuilder","2009-01-07T08:46:19.327Z","I shall now run away with my precious little orb thing.","Really nice. It transforms for either a quick get away or a switch to combat. Ogel minion=fail.

Pros: Shooting cannon turret thing on top, good for defense when on the run.
The transformation thing is just awesome!
The agent dude is really cool, I think he was new from the Alpha Team original series.
Orange translucent laser cannon elements are a real plus in this new series. I think they are to melt ice or something.

Cons: Ok, the minion dude is really strange and isn't really a match for the Blizzard Blaster in my opinion. I think the ultimate set would have been that Ogel Freeze Scorpion thing along with this. But hey, if you have both, just chuck away the noob minion guys from each side back into the boxes, or else make something cool out of them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But after receiving this set for my birthday I decided that it was actually not that bad to have. The building is easy going and hours of play is guaranteed.</p>",TRUE,3,5,5,4,3
