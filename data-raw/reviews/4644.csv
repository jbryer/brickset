It has good colous, which makes it ideal to use with other sets.<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Great colours!</li><li>Rare colours!</li><li>Lots of bricks!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>No plates.</li><li>No angled bricks (roof plates,&nbsp;etc.)</li><li>Too many 2x bricks (the walls you build will usually be 2 knobs wide)</li></ul><h4>Overall:</h4></div><p>This will be an enjoyable set if you use it with another set with more detail. Otherwise, get this set if your houses&nbsp;need more&nbsp;walls, or higher walls.</p><p>So I really&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set if your house is too small, or if you house is totally white.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,3
