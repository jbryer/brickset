As the theme suggests, these were made for small toddlers aspiring to be a LEGO master builder in near future. The pieces snap on and come off easily, allowing toddlers to remove the pieces without any extra force. The lid of the box makes sorting fun (for babies) as they can recognise shapes and place them in the correct holes. The bricks used here can be mixed with other Baby sets such as the Baby Mickey subtheme which has more interesting pieces for toddlers like vehicle chassis and printed bricks.
