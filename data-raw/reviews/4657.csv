It has two transparent lightblue chefshats for example. Fishes in transred and transpurple.
Seastars in some kind of transyellow lightup colour, crabs in lightorange. Croissants.
All kinds of great parts, if you like sets/parts that have to do with magic, this is musthave set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-23T14:29:51Z","Great Pieces in new colors","There are a lot of new colors of transparent pieces. Fish in pink and orange, light blue jellyfish, Castle tops in blue. The three figures are like last year, elbows and ankles do not bend. The heads do not come off if you like to &quot;change clothes&quot;. There is only one of the plastic backgrounds. Good baseplates. Lots of starfish and orange crabs. Worth the money just for the pieces if you like Belville. Probably worth it for the new pieces for regular lego fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
