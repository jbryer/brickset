"Novelty","2007-04-21T08:16:05.38Z","Ghost copter","There's a lot going for this little micro copter - nice colour scheme of blue/red/white, the standard chopper design, a nice cool set.  It looks cool, plays well and is solidly built.  The only downside is that there's no minifig to go along with it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-08T11:22:23.707Z","Just Hovering","Yet another classic model. This one being in the traditional helicopter shape. The model itself says im good I dont need a fig.

As I mentioned basic shape, two gear leavers, both propellers rotate and the colour scheme of blue, red and white says classic.

Really there are no flaws from this model. Mainly due to its size and age.

Overall its a good solid model that gets a 6/10 in my book, mainly down to playability I guess. A nice little model for 25 pieces and a good addition if you can pick one up or build it out of spares.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-10-14T09:36:30.21Z","Mini Copter","<p>I think this was a set I picked up from youth due to it's affordability. That or it came in a Christmas Stocking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good solid little set with no minifig for it, but that's alright when you've got other minifigs in other sets who can use this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the age, it's a solid little design and bright contrast of colors.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3

This set was practically replicated as the later 6515 Stunt Copter with a few changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>The review of 6515 covers all the basics of this set. However there are a few differences; the twin exhausts are in a different location below the tailboom and there is no small tail as it lacks the sloped brick at the rear but does have a collision-warning light! The rotors are 1x6 bricks rather than the flat bricks used on 6515 and the other two rotors are left bare. The red, white and blue colours don't really work as well either. So you get a basic helicopter which is easy to build and fairly durable, except for the rotors that fall off. </p><p>No minifigure was included but if you had spare figures and helmets then you didn't need one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>If I had&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice today I would go with the slightly better 6515. It's fairly easy to add the improvements of the later set onto this set though. Overall for the small cost it was a worthy addition and its bricks certainly proved useful for other builds. </p>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
