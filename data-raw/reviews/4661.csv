<p>Maybe you have to turn to fairy tales to get a set that contains absolutely no parts in standard Lego colors, and fewer common parts than unusual ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly that&#39;s what you get in this lovely small set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Thumbelina is a small set, with just under 50 pieces, but it&#39;s like no other.&nbsp; To begin with, it has a boatload of transparent parts, including panels and 2x2 flowers in light bright trans green.&nbsp; There is an 8x8 round tile in standard green and a flat six-bladed propeller piece in magenta.&nbsp; Plus two types of transparent glitter plastic film pieces and a chrome Belville crown.&nbsp; And did I mention the table setting?&nbsp; In addition to a normal red mug (the same kind a firefighter would have coffee from) there is a container of strawberries (clear minifig head printed with strawberry design) and one of the wonderful Belville/Fabuland teapots.&nbsp; Add a pale lime green 4x6 plate and you&#39;re in fairy tale heaven when it comes to parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only minifig is a Belville fairy, which is a figure that has its pluses and its minuses.&nbsp; She&#39;s cute, small, compact and nicely proportioned, but on the other hand she has no moving parts.&nbsp; As a result she either stands up or she lies down.&nbsp; Those are your choices.&nbsp; Luckily, the set includes a bed, which is a stroke of luck when it comes to fairies.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a 50-piece set, so the build is not particularly special, although it amused me to find that Thumbelina preferred to construct her furniture with different sized legs, which are handily embellished with flowers to make them all balance.&nbsp; She also appears to like having plants and flowers growing from various spots on her bed, so botanically, she&#39;s cool.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I got this set as a birthday gift, and I am truly delighted with it.&nbsp; Any girl who likes the Friends theme would love this set.&nbsp; The Belville fairy is far less stylized and cute-ified than the Friends minidolls, which I actually prefer.&nbsp; The box shows at least four or five alternate builds, so there is plenty of play available, and you can&#39;t go wrong with the parts selection.&nbsp; Just a totally excellent little set.</p>
