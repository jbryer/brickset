"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-15T13:14:12Z","nice set ","it is a nice choice if you want to just relax and build lego for an hour. it is not challenging, but still fun to build. also it looks cute, well designed for a little model. 

I want to add some opinions also about the site. (moderators can delete this part after reading:)) 
I am new to the site and it is brilliant. keep up the good work:) if you need any help, you can email to me, kinetica46@yahoo.com  but i can't go further than moderating, as long as I don't have web knowlegde or programming &lt;:)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing remarkable to see&nbsp;except for the usual fare.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing remarkable except a couple of&nbsp;panels and flex rods.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Instructions are easy to follow.The build&nbsp;starts with the main chassis of the truck and the tipping mechanism.&nbsp;It then proceeds to the cab section and finally the dumper bed.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The truck looks good in the grey blue color scheme. The cab section is quite good looking. The dumping bed has a lot of open spaces and looks off a little bit... But the shaping is done well with the long flex rods. The steering is controlled by a gear on top of the cab as is the norm&nbsp;with all Technic&nbsp;sets. The wheels over steer to touch the wheel arches some times but that is acceptable.&nbsp;A gear to the side controls the tipper and has ample friction and realistic&nbsp;speed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is below average value for money as it has a low piece count. The functions are okay and work as expected. Another downside is the &#39; hole ridden&#39; tipper bed that is unusable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The functions are fun to play with.</p>

<p>The B- model is quite interesting being a road sweeper and has good functions.</p>

<p>On the whole this set is not bad but not something that is a must for any fan of Technic.</p>
