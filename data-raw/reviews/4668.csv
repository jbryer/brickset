It's rather cheap for the 66 pcs and completely studless. Now to the models:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mini Loader:
This is a nice small vehicle, which is a realistic adaption of the real bobcat loaders. It has no steering, because of it's smallness but there's a working excavator bucket. You turn the piece on the back and it lifts. And one function is enough for the smallness, so I come to a solid 8/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mini Frontend Loader:
This is a very small frontend loader, which looks somewhat ugly. But with only 57 pieces it can't be much better. The function is the same as in the main model but the turning wheel is on top of the loader.
Altough ugly looks, I come to a 7/10, because of the mechanism in this small model.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Overall a good small technic set, which looks good together with the Forklift. In total it's a 7,5/10, but rounded up to a solid 8/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
