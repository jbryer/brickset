Now I will say, first and foremost, this is a very good rendition of the Enzo Ferrari. BUT, there is one glaring ommission from a set of this size(and price!)...no transmission. also, there is a hand of god steering, but it doesn't connect to the steering wheel in the vehicle. There is no suspension, either, another feature expected on a set of this caliber. The doors are also only manually opened, no assist mechanisim, like on 8448 and 8466. The rear hatch is operated by the air dampened shocks, and the rear axle is driven through the CV joints previously found on the 8466 Off Roader, along with a monster V12 engine, but there are too few technical features on this set to really count as a &quot;Super Car&quot;.The overall external styling of the Enzo is quite good, considering a production lego set. There are spoke wheel inserts that really set off the model with a new part previoulsy not used in lego sets. I admit, without actually building this model, I cannot give you a true review from a building it expierience, but I am being very fair here. Lego could have gone to the extra effort to add the omitted features, even if it had to cost more, it would have made this a true &quot;Super Car&quot;.  I will be modifiying this one to include all the listed omissions. Good thing I've got an extra transmission lying around.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-20T19:45:58Z","Addenum to my previous review","I just completed assembly of the Enzo, and I have to point out that I was incorrect in stating that the doors are unassisted and the rear hatch was assisted by the dampened shocks, it is actually just the opposite. all other points in my review remain the same, with one note- the current lego transmission layout would not have fit in this model, without it being a bit wider. That said, I did enjoy building it. It was a minor challenge level to build, and TLC did a great job on the mechanisim to open scissor doors. The &quot;Down&quot; position is a bit tricky to get the doors to set, but once set, they do stay down until triggered by a slightly hidden button. The mag wheel inserts aren't as nice looking up close, but as a static model on a shelf, they do give the model unique styling. My rating remains an 8 for this. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2006-01-05T07:25:51Z","Wholly Enzo","I have never owned a Technics set before, as I prefer traditional bricks with a solid appearance. With no new sets coming out for a while, and Christmas money to spend, I found myself studying the box art in my local store. The more I looked, the more I was convinced it was a very clever and complex set. I was intrigued to find out what it would be like to build a large Technics model, so I handed over 80 GBP and took it home. The fact that it was a Ferrari helped persuade me I should get this, as I have all the other “solid” Ferrari sets - including 3 of the excellent 8652 Enzo/F333 SP. I write this therefore as someone who is not a Technics aficionado.

The set is amazingly complex to build compared to normal bricks, so from that viewpoint I found the build an enjoyable challenge – getting familiar with and enjoying this new genre.  The parts come in numbered bags, which limits the amount of parts you have to search through at each stage. This helps with the construction, but even so, it took me several hours over 3 evenings to complete the 1,300 odd pieces (I was in no hurry) and I was constantly in awe of the guys who designed this set – very complex and clever. An important factor to me, whatever I build, is accuracy and likeness to prototype. When finished, it does look like what it is supposed to - an Enzo, it is not some mythical Lego creation that does not actually exist, but a real car, which obviously made it more difficult to design – no modeller’s licence here. 

I have read the other reviews before writing this, and am aware of the criticism of others. I do agree that it is unfortunate that the steering wheel is not connected to the steering mechanism and I shall try and achieve this if possible, as I think it detracts from the set. However, part of me thinks if the designers could have included this perhaps they would, or more likely perhaps they were constrained by price. I am not so sure about the suspension as the Enzo is basically a F1 car in a 2-seater body and does sit very low on low profile tyres. The V12 engine is very clever with its working pistons and crankshaft, but as I was not aware there was a Lego transmission anyway, I did not miss it. There is a differential though which works well. The doors open assisted by hydraulic rams, which again is cleverly designed. The engine compartment opens (unassisted) to reveal the engine as detailed above – though with the see – thru appearance of Technics this is not really necessary. I notice there is a version of the set on the Brickshelf site where someone has filled in some of the holes to make a superb model – as well as changing it to right hand drive – being English I approve of this.

I love this set.  Despite the criticisms – it is large, very enjoyable to construct, fascinates and intrigues everyone who sees it (including me) and this is what I bought it for. I think the fascination with Technics is in being able to see the outside and inside at the same time – especially the working features. I am now considering getting more Technics sets - the 8421 crane looks similarly intriguing. They say expectation is everything and it lived up to my expectations (steering wheel aside) and I thought the price was about right, so for that I will give it a maximum score. The only downer is I just found out you can currently buy it from Argos for half price in the sale, but the crane is half price there as well so all may not be lost - if you can find an Argos store that still has one!

"aaron","2005-06-09T00:37:22Z","Not a Super Car","Overall Value: 3 (cost+aesthetics+technical+build)/4: 

This set is less expensive than most Ferrari kits, The price is good for the quantity and style of elements.  

The model is fairly accurate, both it and the real Enzo are terrible looking and have bad aesthetic proportion.
 
----------
Cost: 4 : Good
$0.07 per element  ($99.99US / 1360 elements)

Aesthetics: 2 : Not so good
Form: Strange proportions, odd use and placement of cosmetic elements, the engine compartment looks good
Elements: (Color, Material, Texture): same old stuff, standard red and black elements, there a lot of ball linkage suspension elements however they are not used for this purpose

Technical: 3 : The doors are the best part
Engine / Drivetrain: V12 Engine / No transmission 
Suspension: None (full suspension would have made this a much better set)
Steering: Hand of god linkage, no tie in to the cabin :(
Actuations: ++ Opening Gull wing/scissor Doors, Trunk/Boot opens to reveal the large engine

Build: 3 : Good
Large well constructed model, but not a lot of features

"dunx125","2007-12-17T08:45:03.843Z","Great set - should have way more technical functions though","I got this set 2nd hand for $80, a very good price. As it was my first technic set, I was very impressed with the design and functions. After buying 8421 and 8868, it begins to look rather pathetic, but the looks and quantity of pieces makes up for it. On to the review:

Build: ****
It took me 5 hours to build, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. When compared to other technic sets however (8421, 8868, for example), it falls short, due to the lack of technical functions.

Pieces: ****
It has a good selecton of pieces, especially ones used for styling. I particularly liked the red styling pieces, the silver rims and the large quantity of ball joints.

Looks: *****
This is the main plus point for this model - it looks fantastic. It is a great model to display, and generally gets a good reaction from dark age people. I don't like the looks of the Enzo in real life, but it still looks great in lego.

Technical: **
Not impressive - should at least have independent suspension, and steering linked to the steering wheel. The gull wing doors are brilliantly designed, much better than previous models, which really helps the set. 

On the whole, it is a good set, and the perfect starter set. LEGO can definetely improve on it, but I definetely don't regret buying it.

"Time4TT","2008-12-22T02:37:45.967Z","6th large Lego car","This model follows on in the tradition of Lego building large car models (853, 8860, 8865, 8880, 8448) and for the first time it was modeled on a real car. Lego now used all the specialised panels to recreate the shape of the whole car. With cool doors which opened up with half the roof, and the trunk / boot lifted up to get a closer look at that engine.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"janverdijsseldonk","2010-01-29T07:23:55.293Z","Ferrari Enzo","This is my second Lego Ferrari racer and it looks great. Compared to the 599 (8145) it is technically more advanced thanks to the wing doors. It has a very nice mechanism and although it does not always work perfectly it is the nicest detail of this set.
What I don't like are the oblique placed bricks behind the front wheels which should represent the wheel arches. It´s much to square and it doesn't represent the real Enzo's wheel arch very well.
Technically the set might be a bit disappointing because the car doesn't have wheel suspension, gearbox etc. but than again it's a Lego Racers set and not a true Technic set.
Overall it's a nice set which looks great on a shelf in your room and if you're a Ferrari and/or Lego enthusiast, you definitely should get one!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legowheels","2012-10-14T07:23:05.25Z","Great car for display","<p>As a Lego Technics and Ferrari fan I just had to have this car. I bought this set second hand after building the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8070-1"">8070 super car</a> earlier (which I actually like more than this car, except for the looks). Although this car does not have all the functions that other Technic cars have (hey, it is actually a Racers set, not Technic), I still like it.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is quite large, but that is ok for a set of this size (over 1300 pieces). The instructions are detailed and, in my opinion, don't require a lot of building skill, just close attention.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set comes with a very good amount of parts. You get 20 body panels, suspension with ball joints, unfortunately no shocks for the suspension, very nice wheels, a v-12 piston engine, a differential and two big air dampened shocks (for opening the doors). If you don't like this car, you can still get it just for the parts and build your own.<br></p><h4>The build</h4>The build took me about 4 hours. Nothing really difficult, although non-Technic builders may find it more challenging. The set is big, ok, but not too complex to build, because there are no 
complex mechanisms like in other Technic sets. Basically the car is built in layers, from bottom to top and from rear to front. You build the bottom first, then the ""suspension"", engine and interior, then the front and rear, then the roof, engine hatch and the doors.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Lego did a good job modeling the Ferrari Enzo. There is a good amount of detail, like the lights, the v-12 engine and the exhaust system. I like the way the doors open with the air dampened springs. The opening engine hatch is nice too and even when closed, you can see the v-12 engine and the exhaust tubes. It is really great for display. <br></p><p>As for functions, I would have liked to see working suspension and working steering wheel in the cabin. There actually wasn't much space for a transmission (would require making the car wider) so that is fine with me. There is still plenty of room for modifications.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As a Technic set it gets 4/5. The build is enjoyable and the few functions it has are very nice. Still, it could easily have had working suspension and steering wheel in the cabin, like in the older Lego sets. For a Technic set, it has only little playability. Ok, it is a Racers set. <br></p><p>A good thing is that you don't need to completely rebuild the car for some little modifications, like adding suspension and working steering wheel in the cabin. (just need to remove some parts that are really in the way) Maybe make it remote controlled.<br></p><p>As a Racers set it gets 5/5 for all the details, like v-12 engine, the exhaust, the lights and the wheels. It is really great for display.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4
