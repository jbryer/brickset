"jpmanalo","2005-09-26T10:42:01Z","Loads Of Fun","I got this as a youngster from a McDonalds restaurant. This set gave some of my car-less minifigs in my LEGO town a quick ride around town. I got hours of play from this set, and given the piece count, was very good value at the time.

I give this set 4 stars out of 5.

Another of those models not needing a mini-fig. The car has a beautiful colour scheme of black and yellow, nice sloping from with the number four, which is printed on, not stickered like some more recent rubbish. Also has twin exhausts which are under the spoiler unlike most cars but still cool.

No flaws in this classic model which is what i think makes it a few peoples favourites back in the day.

Overall another quality model from the beginning of the 90's so a strong 6/10 from me and this is a must for any race car fan classic collector or someone wishing to expand their town.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-09-25T05:01:00.003Z","Minifigure Needs A Car?","Town racing was often a fun event if you closed off all your streets so you and friends/brothers/sisters could race all manner of vehicles around. Formula 1/ racing karts were collectable and if you could not get the larger sets it was nice to get a set of numbered vehicles 1-3 if possible.<div><br></div><div><b>Ready To Drive</b></div><div>This is a smart racing car and a really nice design. Its actually a relief that it has no minifigure as most collection's people population exceeds buildings, vehicles and models for them to interact with.</div><div><br></div><div>We have twin exhausts here in light grey, a welcome smooth black wind spoiler plate and the rear seat bar, a great piece. Yellow hubcaps run true with the smart yellow line through the cars length and you can not go wrong with black to contrast this across most of the bricks including the slanting bricks, essential for Racing.</div><div><br></div><div>A surprisingly satisfying short build and definitely worth adding a number 4 print to your racing car line up.</div>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"AETerry","2010-10-23T11:43:12.293Z","Race Car Review","<p>Another of this little minisets that doesn't come with a minifig. And yes, for some reason this is one the best of that lot. The other for me being the minihelicopter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lack of a minifigure aside, its easy to put another minifigure in the drivers seat when there's a plethora of minifigs and a lack of cars to go around. This was also a way to fill out a fleet of cars for a race way set up if someone had missed getting any of the larger Race sets that offered up multiple race cars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one along with another #3 Race Car are solid designs that could easilly be duplicated with pieces on hand to take the #2 Speed Boat from yet another miniset to complete a full fleet of Race Cars for a custom track.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"sf1378","2011-10-06T15:24:55.15Z","NICE RACER","Not much I can say that others haven't. Its a nice set and an impulse buy. Got mine off ebay UK mint in box-open and made naturally.<div><br></div><div>Shame theres no mini figure and I've wondered why Lego did that every once in a while especially when mini figures with sets are the norm since 1978 on the whole...</div><div><br></div><div>Easy to build very quickly and a nice sized racer that uses the smaller chassis that came out in the 1990s and used a lot at that time. The box was nice to look at, with its alternate designs on the back and the yellow bordered box with 'Legoland' on it, I'd forgotten about that on the older boxes...Lego needs to return back to more varied, smaller, affordable impulse buy sets WITH mini figures of course!</div><div><br></div><div>My only gripe-no figure. Other than that its a nice item.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,5
"canbayram","2017-10-31T10:32:30.03Z","Probably my first set","<p>I believe this was the very first LEGO set that we had in the family. I remember having this set along with&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6357-1/Stunt-Copter-N-Truck"">6357-1: Stunt &#39;Copter N&#39; Truck</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6644-1/Road-Rebel"">6644-1: Road Rebel</a>&nbsp;but I can&#39;t remember which came first as I was only 4 or 5 years old at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also didn&#39;t keep the instructions for this one and we kept all LEGO elements together so it was very long time later when I found the instructions for all of them and rebuilt them accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a small black racer with yellow stripes which sits on the common small car platform and nice to have and add to your collection. Just like other fans I also agree it was published to provide an extra set of wheels to your un-vehicled minifigs. It is even nice to put <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71009-1/Homer"">71009-1: Homer</a> inside the seat of this small car and race among the other cars.</p>
