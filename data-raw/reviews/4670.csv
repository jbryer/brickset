"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-13T23:02:08Z","It has everything","I've been away from Lego for 15 years and my love for Formula 1 and Ferrari made me come back. A lot of the other newer sets had so many odd parts which I thought limited creativity. This set is different! I loved being reintroduced to so many familiar parts in this set. 813 pieces of which most are ageless classics and can be reused for almost anything.
 The truck looks good, feels sturdy and can fit all the other things in the set inside it's big belly. The included racer looks hot! 
 Now I wish they would make the Ferrari motorhome also to accompany this truck. I want it all! I'm happy to put this masterpiece behind glass and play with it secretly when my girlfriend is away... :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Super set, please more of this kind of sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-15T00:39:59Z","What a PERFECT TRUCK SET","It's a great set, good design and with precise ratio. The truck is beautiful, big and detail, including more that 800 pieces of lego items. And the price is reasonable. I give it 9 because it has a flaw : this set has too many stickers...if those items can be really painted by pigment. i think it will get 10 from me!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-22T18:55:49Z","best truck","this set is so huge!
i ordered it from a department store since shipping is too much on s@h it is a very cool truck so its my favorite set.
it is so much bigger than it looks in the pic!
the only con is the four left over minifigs but every thing else fits in nicely

buy it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoMan384","2007-11-27T21:57:57.013Z","Perfect for any Ferrari fan!","It has everything you need for a race!  The set has lots of tools and equipment, a pit crew, a driver and a fomula 1 race car! If you have the Ferrari finnish line then this would go great with it.  Here are some pros and cons...
PROS
Comes with lots of mini-figures
Lots of tools and spare parts
Everything can be stores in the truck.
Comes with everything you need to race (except a second car)

CONS
nothing I can think of.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"adik_sa_lego","2007-12-24T10:05:11.937Z","got this one finally!","w00t! got this one for christmas and i must say, even if i bought this one on my own, it's real value for money. 800+ pieces and 2+ hours of building fun. 

as people have said, the set has way too many stickers, especially the front detail of the truck. also, the driver can't sit with his cap on. why oh why?

the fact that it's Ferrari plus the size of the set really makes up for its shortcomings.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"halvee","2010-03-07T13:00:07.17Z","build to win","this is a really good set.If you like building lego, get this set.the mini figures could be better but they still get a 4 star rating from me. 


the truck is really detailed and there are lots of figures to play with,but there is only one car.


cons:
only one car





pros:
the mini figs are class
the truck










i would still give it 5 stars.",FALSE,4,4,5,5,3
"Citizen_Piper","2011-09-05T06:38:40.003Z","the badge sold this truck","this truck doesn't have much on the fancy category, it has a simple building style, regular bricks and straight forward colors. Its the SCUDERIA and FERARI badges that helped sell this truck to F1 lovers.<br><br>What makes this set ""collection-status"" worthy are the details put into the whole package -- a very large truck that flips open on the side and back, a pit crew with tools and spare tires (and engine too) and an F1 race car that can climb inside the lorry. Not bad for its price.<br><br>Though I have some issues. My first complaint (my opinion) is that the minifigure markings are not printed...instead they are just stickers you put on their torso. Second, the truck doesn't have a windscreen, just the pillars on either end. Something you wouldn't expect for a syndicated theme that deserves first rate attention. <br><br>But, to sum it up, its a large truck, F1 car and pit crew that deserves a place in any lego city.<br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5
