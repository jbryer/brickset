But, it was hard to use the spinner sometimes. After some practice I got the hang of it, though. I have two visorak. And I give this one a 5 out of 5. It is my favourite.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The red pieces and green eyes are characteristics of ta-metru's sets. The legs are different to the small arms. It also launchs the rhotuka spinners. Like all visorak, and is also a option for creations.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-20T10:29:37.657Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Visorak) - Visorak Vohrarak Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of great and useful pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. I like the design which LEGO has chosen for the big head and the claw pieces as well.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8742-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The legs and the feet are adjustable. You're also able to push the head down a little bit if you want to move the gray claws. On the back is a launcher which you can use to shoot the spinner.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
