Tis specie like the others, launch spinners on back and have pieces used in some, like the armors, and the eyes. This have cool colors and is long, have different claws in the mouth. The spinner is one of the 05' features. It is a good set, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T09:16:27.42Z","Whew!!","This is a NICE set!!  He comes in third of my favorite Visorak.  Keelerak, my fourth favorite of the four I have, is pretty close though, but he loses it because one of his feet is the wrong color. :-(  Anyway, this blue Visorak are the personal guards of Roodaka, so if you have Roodaka, you should get a Boggarak.  Another reason to buy a Boggarak is just from the looks of it up on your shelf.  Very easy to play with, and the spinner, like all the Visorak and other '05 sets, goes up and away.  Boggarak scores:

Pros:

Spinner is a far-flyer

Color scheme rox

Wicked &quot;look&quot; to his eyes

Crest matches jaws

Powers (storyline speaking)

Roodaka's personal guards

Jaws completely snap shut; you actually hear the *click* sound

Cons:

None!!

Go get Boggarak, if only just for the pieces!  You'll end up keeping him, and he may become your favorite on the spot!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-20T10:36:51.657Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Visorak) - Visorak Boggarak Review","<p>This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and on page 7 you can see a mistake: The pieces which are supposed to be blue are printed in red and orange.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of great and useful pieces for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure. I really like the design which LEGO has chosen for the head and the claw pieces as well.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and there're also no stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8743-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The legs and the feet can be adjusted and if you push the head of this creature you can open and close the gray claw. On the back is a launcher which you can use to shoot the spinner which flies very good.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros-</h4><ul><li>-A perfect mix of regular and light blue works excellently.<br></li><li>-Orange eyes are excellent on water Bionicle.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The mask looks better when actually attached; otherwise, it's weird.<br></li><li>-I also wish that dark blue was a bit more represented.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is really great, and has an excellent design overall. The Rhotuka spinner and pincers are great playability functions also. I recommend this to all who love bugs and Bionicle.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
