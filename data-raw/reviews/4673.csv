"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-26T21:23:41.73Z","Interesting Little Spider","Oohnorak is part a group of spiders called Visorak. Oohnorak is the first up in the reviews. 

The canistar is pretty cool. It contains a graphic of Oohnorak stationed in a web-strung Onu Metru. The back contains an image of the other five Visorak, and displays the Rhotuka function. 

There are the heap of new pieces in this set, including the teeth, the body, the legs and others. The head piece, while new and good looking, doesn't have much use other than this set if your a MOCer. It's usable, but probably couldn't be used for a whole lot. The leg pieces are new, and can be used for quite a lot of things. The teeth are good, but would be much preferable if they had a + rod sticking out the back like all other tools. 

The building process is simple, but you should pay attention to sticking pieces in the main frame. I've messed up a few times, but nothing that can't be fixed easily. 

So the models together, but what can above? Well if built right, pushing on the rear down makes the jaws chomp. Really cool and fun to play with. There's a Rhotuka to play with. The Rhotuka are really amazing. While not really accurate (unless in a vertical position), it flies really high and far. Really cool when launched inside, probably only cool for a while outside. :P

So overall, this set is fun to build and fun to play with. This combined all the new pieces and cool functions earns this set a 5/5 rating. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pieces and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of black and orange pieces. All of them are very useful for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. I like the design of the black head and the gray claws, too.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about pieces as well.<br></p>

On the back is a lever which you can use to launch the spinner which is going to fly very well.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I remember I was super excited when I got this as a present when I was a kid, and I recently rebuilt it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I liked the unusual build, it&#39;s not quite like any other set I have, but it kept my attention, and was fairly entertaining. I was really happy I could dig up the yellow Bohrok eyes, because they only appeared in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the build I noticed the functions, and for a set this size, this thing is jam packed. The pinchers worked exceptionally well, and the spinner flew fantastically. The legs were nice&nbsp;and posable, especially for their size.</p>

<p>My only complaint is the shape of the shell. It really can&#39;t be easily intergrated into anything in a moc without looking obviously &#39;Visorak&#39;.</p>

<p>However, overall, I am really happy with this set. I would totally recommend it.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The details for the weapons and crest of the Oohnorak are smooth, making this little guy very individual.<br></li><li>-The legs of this Visorak are also very individual, and the use of yellow parts, such as in the eyes, is quite clever and cool-looking.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The mask would be a bit better if it were completely attached.<br></li><li>-The blades/pincers are cool, but don't seem to close as well as with other Visorak.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This little Visorak spider is very individual compared to the other two that I have, but does seem to be a bit less functional with the pincers. Buy it, but don't buy all of the Visorak.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
