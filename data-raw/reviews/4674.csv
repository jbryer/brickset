Also the blue eyes somehow look surprisingly good on a brown and red set. The rhotoka spinner can get lost a bit to eaisly which is a bit unfortunate sadly. :( Roporak is good for parts as well because of a few things which are not avalible in any other set. For instance the red rahkshi arms, and then there are the  red parts at the back of the legs too. So overall Roporak is a cool visse and worth your money. Overall rating 9/10. :) ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-24T11:46:21.857Z","It is awesome!","This is so awesome, have a different color scheme, and claws. The metru's brown is in this set, with the first red. The eyes are in a dark color, but is easy to see it. Another with the rhotuka spinner launcher, have also the same feet. Is a great option for make combinations, as in the instructions or not.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BRICKBOY74","2011-08-05T07:49:42.393Z","visorak roporak","<p>Hi I'm Brickboy74's brother. He doesn't have any bionicles yet so I'm reviewing roporak with his account. OK, I'll just skip to the pros and cons...</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<p>-awesome spinner flies really far</p>
<p>-it comes with a spare spinner! (whew)</p>
<p>-pinchers pretty cool and work well</p>
<p>-blue eyes look awesome and evil</p>
<p>-cool spiky feet</p>
<p>-very poseable back legs</p>
<p>-cool molded&nbsp;head with crest</p>
<p>-awesome red highlights</p>
<p>CONS:</p>
<p>-rubber band on pinchers might wear out (solution: put it back in at a different angle)</p>
<p>-front legs have low poseablity</p>
<p>-the brown is okay, I guess</p>
<p>-make sure to keep ripcord in sight cuz I lost it (another solution: order @ lego.com)</p>
<p>-head flops over (I know, weird, right???)</p>
<p>OK so basically, I really reccomend roporak to a friend, and all the visorak. Don't worry about some cons. They're actually really minor, fixable problems. Plus the pros really outweigh all the cons. I might be getting another visorak soon, and my brother, Brickboy74 might too, so look out for more of my reviews.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
