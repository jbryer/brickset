"Gus_263","2008-02-24T12:14:04.31Z","Powerful visorak","One of the most powerful species, this features a spinner launcher, a awesome color scheme, and a head totally different and well designed. The colors are cool, being of the eyes(red) or of the body and legs. The claws are great, very well maded, liking blades. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-16T21:36:57.763Z","Green Bug","I'm not a Bionicle fan, but this set is very interesting. I like the idea of a bug-like creature with two teeth and four legs. I don't like the lime green legs because it makes this set less of a bug. Besides that, this is very good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-01T20:14:48.7Z","Evil Spider","This is a great Visorak!  He was the last one to add to our collection of Visorak.  He would be one of my favorites, but mine has a wrong colored foot as I got him from a friend who broke him up previously and lost one of the feet.  I replaced it with a spare blue one.  Otherwise, a great set!!  As long as you have all the right colored feet (LOL!), he will be your favorite.  The red eyes compliment the green body nicely, as well as the slime green arms and legs.  Lovin' it.  Here's the stats.

Pros:

-Color scheme (especially the eyes)

-Evil, sharp-looking jaws

-Spinner

-Got him for free!

Cons:

-Wrong foot color 

Keelerak is a good Visorak, so please get this set next time you see him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tkettle9719","2012-01-08T10:01:05.523Z","Bionicle Bugs!","<p>I got this set for myself I believe after Christmas in 2005, and think that this is the best Visorak of the bunch, whether it be the well-colored bug, or the awesome pincers.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The Rhotuka spinner is always a nice little touch.<br></li><li>-The pincers are also the best of any Visorak.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-I sort of wish that the mask/head would stay completely on.<br></li><li>-I also wish that the lime green could be more represented.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is truly a winner in my eyes, and is the best bug-like Bionicle ever made by man. I recommend this to all who love bugs, beetles, and Bionicle (The new BBB...).<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
