The color combinations, White and blue makes a great design. The head/body like very the claws, to creations can be used to build various rahi, or make a shield. The visoraks launch very well the spinner. 5/5, good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-02-10T22:32:21.187Z","visorak of ice","this visorak has a great color and has greta articulation. If you press the head down the jaws snap shut which I really like. The rhotuka spinner launches very high into the air and it's pretty easy to use. I really hate the front legs. the tips are not strong enogh and fall forward and/or backward.Great set except for the legs.It also includes instructions to make a Kagarak and it's piecescan be used to make a venom flyer.

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-25T17:35:27.56Z","Second Favorite Visorak","This was my favorite Visorak before I got Roporak.  I like his pale blue eyes, and the spinner that goes very very very very far.  The chompers, also, match the crest on top of his head (like all the other Visorak).  The color scheme, too, makes him look evil and his head makes him look cunning.  The playability on this Visorak is amazing, as well as the posability.  You can even pick up Lego minifigures in them if you want the Visorak to raid a Lego town. :-)  Anyway, here's the Pros and Cons, if there are any.

Pros:

Pale blue eyes

Crest matches jaws

Jaws snap shut by pushing down on his head

Cunning aspect

Color scheme

Spinner shoots very very far

Cons:

None!

These Visorak are worth twice the money, so don't hesitate to buy either Boggarak, Keelerak, Suukorak, Roporak or Vohtorak.  Oohnorak kinda looks bug eyed, though.  So go out and get a couple of Visorak!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
