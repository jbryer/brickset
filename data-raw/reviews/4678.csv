"Laura_Jerbi","2005-08-18T23:31:02Z","Weird, says mom,,,,son says awesome!!","My 10 year old and I put this together.  A bit complicated, and the creature seems to be a bit woobly.   Leave it to a 10 year old to figure out how to expose the spinner. 
As a mom, I am overwhelmed with the range of the Bionicle line.   Cheap sets to awfully price-y, but the &quot;play-ability&quot; will keep my buying them for my son.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lewa_rocks","2007-04-25T13:18:32.153Z","Good set. Cool","This is a cool set the yellow and the gray-silver is just awesome i luve how the spiner is hidden in side of him its cool how you flip the one pice and it opens. I like the spining sheld. He is a bit wobley but when I first got him out of the box I was like wow if you get him and build him you will see what I mean. 
 Good: 1:Hidden spiner 2:Spining sheld 3:color 4: sword.
 Bad: 1:Wobly 2: short arms.

 4 good to 2 bad so I think its a good set the short arms isnt too bad but it would be nice if they were just a little more movable. Well this is a good one to get if you got a 20$ .",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-24T17:33:55.56Z","Awesome titan","This titan, keetongu, is very cool, have some yellow parts with black pieces, like the arms. Of 2005, he likes be smaller than other titans, but looks too stronger. The head includes only one eye, but it is cool and don't like a rahi(beast), as in the story line. He shoots a spinner too, this in the center. His weapons are great, like the rotating shield.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 48 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has a lot of useful pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. The bags are numbered.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8755-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The legs, the feet, the arms, the hands and the head can be adjusted. On one hand we can see a double-sided shield which sviwels full 360°. The other hand has a sword. On the body is a piece which you can fold down if you want to use the spinner which flies very well. I really like the orange color on him as well. The only thing I don't like that this guy falls down very easily, too. I depends on the position of the legs.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I'm aware that Bionicle has been out of production for two years now, but that does not detract from them at all. They are still amazing toys. I got the Voporak set on Amazon, and since I think that model is hideous, I built the three figures instead. Keetongu is an unusual figure, as he is as far as I know, the only rahi (animal), that appears to be an ordinary figure. There are some terrific features present.<div><br></div><div>Pros</div><div>good color</div><div>some rarer pieces</div><div>sturdy</div><div>slightly but not overly technic build</div><div>rotating shield works well</div><div>finally a red spinner!</div><div>I like how the rip cord is stowed on his back, and not stupid looking like on other models</div><div>although there is no head persay, it doesn't look awful</div><div>flip out chest is very cool and unique</div><div><br></div><div>Cons</div><div>too short</div><div>blade on right arm is kind of stupid looking (however it is a good size)</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, this is a very well designed set.
