<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 76 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some nice and useful pieces: We get a lot of dark red and black pieces which are always great to have for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br></p>

in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

Each arm is attached at the shoulder to a large technic wheel, which allows the arm to spin around vertically. This severely limits posability. Also, on mine, the left gear squeaks terribly, though I'm not sure if this is standard or not. The right arm simply ends in a blade, so it is nearly impossible to pose. The left arm does have a joint in it, but simply ends in the claws.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite the terrible arms, I still give Sidorak a four out of five.

<p>This set is an excellent accompanist to the rest of the series for 2005, and is very individual. I highly recommend this set.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Nmfrey23","2022-01-01T20:55:20.99Z","All hail the king","<p>This guy is supposed to be the King of the Visorak-the spider-like creatures released in 2005. Despite his title as King, Sidorak is anything but intrepid and confident. Either way, the set itself is definitely representative of a ruler. The Titans of 2005 were arguably the best part of Bionicle in the year, and Sidorak fits right in with the other two released alongside him.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is more complex than most, since the feet, legs, torso, arms and head are custom builds.</p>

<p>Posing: This set features more movement than others that were released before it.</p>

<p>Torso build: The torso is armoured very well, and makes the set look more complete with its wide shoulder pads.</p>

<p>Functions: This set has 2 functions. Sidorak&#39;s left arm is cut off at the elbow and has a switchblade-like weapon attached to it that&nbsp;can flick out and retract. His second function is his spinner which he holds in his hand. His hand has a much-needed thumb and two forefingers to keep the spinner still.</p>

<p>His right arm is connected via. friction pin, so he can aim his spinner (also makes a cool clicking sound when moved).</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Poor balance due to the set&#39;s&nbsp;height and thin limbs&nbsp;</p>

<p>The left arm has no friction and hangs loosely at Sidorak&#39;s side</p>

<p>His arms have 2 different shoulders, The top shoulder allows for the arms to move forward and back and the second shoulder allows for the arms to move outward and inward</p>

<p>Back of the set is flat and unfinished looking</p>

<p>At the end of the day, while Sidorak wasn&#39;t a great king, he did make for a great set that managed to combine form and function well. 4/5</p>
