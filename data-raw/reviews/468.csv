"A_Brickset_user","2005-10-14T02:36:14Z","Mini-fig Overboard!","Designed to look sleek, modern and fast in the traditional Lego colour combo of red and white, this little set also has the appeal of a James Bond prop  - minus a mini-fig that could have been James Bond himself! Which begs the question: &quot;Mini-fig overboard?!&quot; ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-01T06:34:57.653Z","A Multitude of Uses…","This set is very similar to Set 1069 (Black and Red Speedboat) but to me this looks to be the top-end model.   Smooth white hull with a red band on the hull with white forepeak and deck complete with tinted blue sports-style windshield and small cockpit follow the same lines as the other set (1069) but this speedboat also features a large black and yellow outboard motor mounted on a tilting bracket on the transom.   Also fitted to the transom are two small black and white antennae.

No minifig is supplied with this set, perhaps this indicates it could be a hire boat or perhaps on display outside a marina office for sale?

Again, this set can be used in many different ways, grouped together in a marina, as part of a speedboat hire fleet, as a tender to a larger boat or yacht, on a trailer behind a car it goes on … Again it’s simple yet so pleasing and can be the base of many future boats.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's alright as that lack of minifigure just opens the possibilities of what one can do with this set and how to use it in a larger scenario or to pull apart and use the pieces for other MOCs.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
