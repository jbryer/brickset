"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-18T23:12:11.667Z","This set is not designed for those in puberty. Nope, not at all.","Even so, the set is great. The ponytail is cool, the head nicely done and movable, the spinner thing has some brains behind it (rare these days) and the body certainly gets the point across.

Roodaka is the coolest Bionicle enemy since the 2001 Makuta. Just so you know. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-27T14:14:55.827Z","One of the best female bionicle","Roodaka is very well maded, looks like a female character, different to some matoran and toa of water. The catcher claws are too usable, it works easily, like the spinner launcher in another hand. She is tall, and have awesome colors. The combination of black and silver is great. She don't have a mask, but the head is maded with very things that makes she likes the viceroy of visorak. Some itens are in this set, turning it usable to creations. I rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-21T01:49:39.59Z","Roodaka Rocks!","No wonder Sidorak liked her. She is one pretty nice lady.

Pros:
- Head is unique
- Left weapon spins
- Rhotuka spinner
- Feet look like high heels
- Armouring
- Build

Cons:
- A bit hard to stand

Roodaka is one of the greatest Bionicle sets ever created and all Bionicle fans must buy her ASAP!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hobohopper","2009-08-08T15:56:20.03Z","one of the greatest","truly one of the greatest bionicle titans of all time. on par with the likes of takanuva 2008.

she stands about 12 inches tall, very big for a 20$ set. i love how much detail the designers gave her. she has curves, hips, high heels, chest, and even long hair. roodaka's claws whiplash back and forth when you turn the stick in various directions. the only bad thing i can think of for this set is the launcher. i dont get why the designers made it so that you had to pull the luancher itself instead of the rip cord, which is attached to roodakas arms.

all in all

"BioSludge","2013-06-02T13:18:58.117Z","In my opinion, #2 Bionicle Set OF ALL TIME","<p>This is an amazing set. Wonderful. Wonderful. The face is awesome, with a mouth you can move, and- ARE THOSE EARRINGS? A female Bionicle that actually looks female, at last! Come on, high heels, earrings, a ponytail, a couple of *conveniently placed* Rahkshi heads- Sidorak was a lucky guy...until she left him to die.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>High heels</li><li>Rahkshi heads</li><li>Decorated head</li><li>Catcher Claw</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Awkward Rhotuka placement</li></ul>
<p>If you are a living creature, you must buy this. No excuses.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"ThoughtLash","2016-01-11T23:10:40.947Z","""... though I am not a Visorak, I too can weave a web.""","<p>This set is tied with the Skopio XV-1 for my favorite BIONICLE, and I&#39;m leaning more towards the Viceroy.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A rather large cardboard box, a little over 12&quot; tall and 2&quot; or so wide.&nbsp;The front features an image of Roodaka lunging towards the viewer, and launching one of her mutation rhotuka spinners (ouch), all while twirling her claws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back has several pictures, two showing off Roodaka&#39;s features (firing rhotuka, rotating capture claws), and two showing of the combo models.&nbsp;On the left is Sentrahk, along with two tiny photos of&nbsp;Keetongu and Sidorak, and the right is The Shadowed One, with Roodaka and Keetongu.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots and lots of black and silver, with a few blue pins, grey parts, yellow spinner peg, and the awesome trans-orange claws used for eyes.&nbsp;If you&#39;re really into collecting BIONICLE, you&#39;ll probably have most of these pieces, but the silver Rahkshi heads are very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quite a few parts, including the above heads, are used from the Rahkshi of 2003.&nbsp; Roodaka&#39;s upper arms and lower legs are black Rahkshi legs, while her capture claws are turned using the technic axle from their staffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Four Toa Metru feet are included, two black and two silver, which are used as armor and heels respectively.&nbsp;Lots of those little triangle-shaped pieces are included, in both black and silver.&nbsp;A pair of Pohatu Nuva&#39;s climbing claws are used as her left hand.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I build fast, so she took about 20 minutes.&nbsp;Her torso build is rather complex, and is an enjoyable build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Roodaka looks AMAZING! She&#39;s pretty much the only feminine G1 BIONICLE, yet still looks very menacing.&nbsp;Her right arm features a rhotuka, which can be launched when you remove the launcher, not the ripcord.&nbsp;The left arm has twin claws, which spin when a technic axle is rotated. The Vortixx&#39; head looks great, and features an opening mouth that glows in the dark.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you can find this set for cheaper than $60, BUY IT!!!!</p>
