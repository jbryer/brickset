"Gus_263","2008-03-13T14:32:14.577Z","Sir Danju","The Sir Danju set, released in 2005, is basically a remake of the danju in 2004. This set have the same purple color of Danju, and the same helmet and playability. But the notable differences are the gold coloured armors, details, torso and weapons. Some of the changes are good, due to optimize the design and Danju looks like more a knight, but these changes are also bad due to the use of the pieces, that do not stay very well on other sets. The color sheme is nice and also the shield, withmore texture and the design of a wolf. The sword is also good, the best of the knights kingdom series in 2005. The details do that the set looks like more new, but the helmet is the same of the danju in 2004. The playability is like the knights kingdom figures, with gears and some systems also used on Exo force and creator series, that works well, but it is not much like a lego, because the body is a unic piece. The knight's face is the same with a yellow color. Overall, Sir Danju isa great set, that looks like more a building action figure of a knight. So, i rate 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is one of the new 'action figure' types of LEGO back then and usually appealed to those who like characters as big as their Bionicles. I did not find this set very nice at all but I appreciate the fact that they installed 2x4 studs on the shield, for no reason.

In comparison to the first wave, the second version of these figures are far better. There's more of a modular snap together build then a Bionicle style build, which I myself prefer this modular to the Bionicle style if I'm going to put out money for these types of sets. The body and limbs look better and the shield is plastic, not card board.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,2
