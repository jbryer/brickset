The gold is a good color for the shield, but no very for the torso. The sword isn't cool than the other knights, like rascus, santis, vladek or danju. It is strange and little. The helmet have little upgrades comparing with the  first Jayko. I rate it 4/4, good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-17T18:52:17.953Z","Sir Jayko Review","In retrospect, why I picked up these large action figure type sets, I don't know. In comparison to the first wave, the second version of these figures are far better. There's more of a modular snap together build then a Bionicle style build, which I myself prefer this modular to the Bionicle style if I'm going to put out money for these types of sets. The body and limbs look better and the shield is plastic, not card board.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,2
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-14T10:12:49.34Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Sir Jayko Review","This figure is really nice to play with and fun to have as well. The build is very easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved and the visor can sviwel as well. On the back of the torso you can find two levers. One lever moves the arm with the shield up and down and the other lever moves the arm with the sword up and down. As I told you in the beginning:  It's a cool figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"tkettle9719","2011-12-27T15:44:41.04Z","The Knight who Would be King...","<p>This is my first version of Jayko, who becomes King in the storyline due to the fact that the King Mathias is growing older, and because Jayko has proven himself worthy. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The sword isn't exactly time period material, but it looks quite nice. <br></li><li>-The armor additions are a worthy welcome for the new knights. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The legs make him seem a bit unhuman.<br></li><li>-I rather dislike the gold on his breastplate and shield, a bit out of place.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This figure is nice, and has many exclusive pieces which add to his overall value. I'd buy him, Vladek, and Mathias (from this series), which would make a nice little battle. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
