"Gus_263","2008-02-11T11:25:23.857Z","Knight of APE?","A good knight, the most likely to be a real knight. But, his symbol is a ape? It is very strange, i think that lego choose rascus to have this symbol because he is a joker, and apes are included in some jokes. The colors are cool, like the green scheme of matau and lewa the classic green toas and the gold of iruini. The sword is a good one because it is greater than  the jayko's sword.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-16T08:46:51.8Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Sir Rascus Review","This is a nice figure to have and it's very easy to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers and this figure is very easy to maneuver as well. The arms, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved and the visor does sviwel as well. On the back of the torso you can also see two gears. One gear makes the left arm which has a sword in the hand moving up and down. The other one moves the shield on the other hand to the right and/or to the left.  As I told you in the beginning:  It's a nice figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2011-02-17T18:53:21.99Z","Sir Rascus Review","In retrospect, why I picked up these large action figure type sets, I don't know. In comparison to the first wave, the second version of these figures are far better. There's more of a modular snap together build then a Bionicle style build, which I myself prefer this modular to the Bionicle style if I'm going to put out money for these types of sets. The body and limbs look better and the shield is plastic, not card board.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,2
