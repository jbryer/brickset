The sword is the third most cool. The armors are the same of the knights, changing only the color. The moves of Sir Santis are the most playable of the 2005 year. The helmet don't like a real knight, but it is cool too. 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-16T08:40:45.697Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Sir Santis Review","This is a great figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved and the visor is able to sviwel as well. If you move the torso to the left you can move the arm and the hand with the sword up and down. The other hand has a shield with some nice markings. As I told you in the beginning:  It's a great figure to have for sure - 
even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) 
and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2011-02-17T18:54:30.69Z","Sir Santis Review","In retrospect, why I picked up these large action figure type sets, I don't know. In comparison to the first wave, the second version of these figures are far better. There's more of a modular snap together build then a Bionicle style build, which I myself prefer this modular to the Bionicle style if I'm going to put out money for these types of sets. The body and limbs look better and the shield is plastic, not card board.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,2
