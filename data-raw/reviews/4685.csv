"Gus_263","2008-02-11T11:29:35.997Z","Lord of scorpion","This vladek have a new helmet, changing very that it was, looking more a villain. The crimsom and black are cool than the turaga dume. The sword is black, and smaller than his 2006 edition. The symbol is the same, scorpion. The black armors are the same of 2005 knights, very good to this body.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-02-17T18:55:51.213Z","Lord Vladek Review","In retrospect, why I picked up these large action figure type sets, I don't know. In comparison to the first wave, the second version of these figures are far better. There's more of a modular snap together build then a Bionicle style build, which I myself prefer this modular to the Bionicle style if I'm going to put out money for these types of sets. The body and limbs look better and the shield is plastic, not card board.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,2

	I got this set from my uncle for Christmas many years ago, and it is still one of my favorites in the series.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The new weapons and armor are excellently done.</li>
	<li>
		A cliche red eyed villain actually really works.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The sword moves very strangely rather than up or down, like Rascus&#39; shield.</li>
	<li>
		The shield here doesn&#39;t even move at all. There&#39;s a reason this villian&#39;s still around...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Other than the Kings, this is my favorite knight ever, so I highly recommend it to any other Knights Kingdom II fan.</p>
