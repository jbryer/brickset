This was released when the knights received the sir title, and he continued being king. The colors are great, but the gold isn't too shiny. He don't have additions, like the version of king jayko or lord vladek in 2006, but still good, a lego and action figure. The body is only one piece because it have gear systems to make moves, if were separated, the costs were expensive. The crown is smaller than the knights' helmets. The sword is the same of the sir santis minifigure, have a detail that looks like with a paw of bear or lion, the symbols of santis and mathias, with details of heads of these animals in the armor on the body. Altough this is an action figure, is very useful to lego themes, like the arms and legs parts, compatibles with system, exo-force, and many themes, also technic. Another features are the cover, darker than the used on jayko. The blue color is included, makes a great scheme with gold, and is more included on this set than the king version of jayko.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Box/Fortress = 5/5
Nicely done, with fortress detail and nice picture.

Not challenging. Only, legs, hands + weapons, and huge torso.

"AETerry","2011-02-17T18:57:03.507Z","King Mathias Review","In retrospect, why I picked up these large action figure type sets, I don't know. In comparison to the first wave, the second version of these figures are far better. There's more of a modular snap together build then a Bionicle style build, which I myself prefer this modular to the Bionicle style if I'm going to put out money for these types of sets. The body and limbs look better and the shield is plastic, not card board.",FALSE,2,1,1,2,2

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The lion emblems on the shield and torso are awesome to behold.<br></li><li>-The new sword is classic and fits with this knight perfectly.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The white on the back of the king is an odd choice, and doesn't accompany it.<br></li><li>-The gray socket connectors are also just an odd choice.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is one of the best and most classic knights in my entire collection, and treasure it so. Buy it, as it is really marvelous and bold. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
