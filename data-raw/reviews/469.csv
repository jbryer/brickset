Well as you can see its a small loader, one of those classic models with no mini-fig. The model itself is all yellow with a red seat and a touch of black. The headlights on this model are actually clear studs which really works with the yellow of the model. The bucket is fully working and is great fun to play with.

No real problems with this model but the smaller front wheels than backs looks kind of strange. Not sure why this was done but i checked and its got nothing to do with the clearance of the bucket arms.

Overall This is a neat little model and adds something to anyone who collects or plays town/city or construction. Also a nice model for any collector so a 6/10 from me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
