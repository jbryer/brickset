"Blade","2007-07-13T07:34:06.933Z","Average Attack","Well I liked this little set as it was another one towards my castle collection. 

As for an army building set i dunno. I mean how many catapults can 1 team have? not that i dislike the catapult brilliant idea as it is so basic. Also how many red knights can 1 team have?

The set is good but it feels like it is missing something like something was forgotten to be put in.

Overall 5/10 An average set. Good money for value.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-03T14:23:00.2Z","Catapult Cart","This is a small set of the knights' kingdom theme and was released in 2005. Have the name &quot;Fireball catapult&quot;, but don't launchs fireballs, but a spiked disk, that is launched very well. The catapult keeps in feet because have two wheels, like a cart. Have two minifigures, like the small set of the 2004 year, named &quot;Vladk Encounter&quot;. In the year that this set was released, the knights received  the title sir in their names, except vladek, named Lord Vladek. So, in this set is included the sir santis minifigure, with small differences, more in the shield, more shorter than the older and with one symbol in a place of two. In this he continues with an armor and with weapons. His helmet as minifigure was made due to the action figure of himself. The other minifgure is a version of a shadow knight, hanging an axe. The color scheme is great, the red of the minifigures, like of santis, and the brown of the catapult. Another additions are weapons on the set, like the spear of joust with the horse. The horse is another addition like the catapult, this have an armor to head, is white and can carry weapons or a flag too included. This is a good small set, and the figure likes with  the action figures. The series overs, but these sets are better than the new castle theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"penguin3332","2008-07-27T16:34:33.03Z","Catapult and Horse","This was my first Knight's Kingdom set and was what got me into the theme.  I got this set mainly for the horse in the set (I needed it for my farm, and it was the cheapest with a horse).

Great things-

-Nice silvery pole for the flag on the horse and teeth
-Cool horse accessories
-Fun catapult launching action
-Catapult flings the fireball very far
-Nice Santis minifig with cool bear emblem
-Shadow Knight looks cool

Dislikes-

-A bit overpriced
-Catapult is a little bit unconsistant
-One Santis is all you need

Overall, this is an excellent way to get a fun catapult for army building, or to get nice minifig accessories.   ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2012-03-03T16:26:00.003Z","Fireball Catapult Review","<p>Knights Kingdom... I could call this either a Golden Era or a Silver Era of Castle. All of the named Knight minifigures that came out were pretty good characters. Which made picking this set up for a specific minifigure easy to do. It's price tag of $8 made purchase of this set really easy to do and if it weren't for Santis, I'd have considered a couple more to do army building.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form with clear step-by-step illustrations. On a second rebuild of this set, it was a bit difficult to tell if the saddle of the horse should be black or dark grey, otherwise it was easy to follow the steps and figure out what pieces are needed.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 46 pieces, that coupled with the horse and the two minifigures, it's a decent build. Many of the pieces are very specific and seem only fit for this type of a catapult build, so it doesn't seem to work out too well as a parts set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's two minifigures that come with this set. That of the red knight known as Santis and featuring a bear symbol on his shield. The other is one of Vladek's Scorpion Guards or Warriors. Both are very good in their detailing and symbols. And this is one of the cheaper sets to get a hold of Santis in.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>I've got a lot of small sets that involve catapults. Making it that on one hand, I'm a bit ho hum about having another one, but on the other hand, this is a good catapult. The use of the rubber piece makes it so you can pull it back and let it fly forward to launch the whirling, fiery wheel piece. In addition you get one of Valdek's soldiers and Santis on horseback. So all around it does turn out to be pretty good. <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In all I'd say this set is worth it for those who were picking the Knights Kingdom sets and looking to build armies or get cheap sets featuring the Knights themselves. Before Fantasy Era came out, this had been one of the better sub-themes for Castle out. I didn't go for collecting up too many though as with all of my Classic Castle line, I've hit points where some sets do get to feeling redundant. Given that, this is still a good set.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Ernst","2012-01-30T16:18:04.143Z","Fireball Catapult, let's fry Santis !","<p>Overall 4 bricks: again a small and good set of Knights Kingdom II, this time unlike the catapult in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=43017"">set 8777</a>, Lego provided us with a good catapult. The set has nice minifigures and is very affordable so 4 bricks I think are deserved here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks: Building it is a nice and easy job, first you built the base for the launching machine which is attached to 2 technic beams with holes on which you place the big wheels. The elastic band&nbsp;you have to attach makes it shoot very well.&nbsp;Because of its wideness it is well balanced. The two silver tooth plates make a nice finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;3 bricks: again a lot of nice parts here but not exceptional. Two good minifigures and a horse but with a minimum of weapons. Santis has a flagpole instead of a spear and a shield or an extra spear would have been welcome for the Shadow Knight. The firewheel looks great and the 2 silver teethplates are nice too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty 4 bricks: you can try to shoot Santis and fry him in just one shot. Two Knights with extra's are always very playable, single and combined with other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks: I got it for about â‚¬5,00 which is somewhat the average price for this small set which is a good deal considering the parts this set offers.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
