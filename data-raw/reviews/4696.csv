I like how you can make the mini figures sit down at the front of the battle wagon or stand up.the only thing i dont like about the set is that you cant make the mini figs stand or sit at the very top of the battle wagon(where the catapult is)I got this set for only $10.00!!!

"iephant","2007-03-14T21:25:06.28Z","Lego is finally putting more guys in sets!","Unfortunatly thats the only good thing about this set... The wagon is ok, the Saddle is good to but why did lego make these knights with such ubsurd colors? Rascus's helmet has a cool shape but why green? The Shadow Knighs are awesome and there are two!
 
Pros
Two Black Knights
The wagon's prison
The horses + saddle

cons
The Wagon's too bulky
Rascus's green armor

"rabk295","2008-11-21T06:56:03.733Z","Pretty good","The overall structure of this set is pretty good, but I never really got into the Knights Kingdom sets except for a very short period of time where I went all out buying them. Boy, do I regret that. This is a pretty well made set, so if you're into this series, than get it. Otherwise, don't waste you're money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-01-29T19:01:08.503Z","Battle Wagon, Catapult & Prisoner Transport ?","<p>Overall 4 bricks: one of the best small or medium sets in the Kingdoms II theme. The wagon is very good and multifunctional and you find 3 Knights and 2 horses in this set. Good on its own and of course a great addition with other sets and lots of great parts in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 4 bricks: building the wagon is not too difficult but fun to do. The ground plates make a firm base for the wagon and the coachmen's platform. The wheelbase under it with the pin system and solid wheels. On the first floor you built what seems to me a prison with 2 strong wooden doors. On the prison roof four high slopes and again a roofplate on which the catapult or fire thrower is placed. Reasult is a strong well armed wagon with lots of possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks: great parts in this set, a huge amount of weapons for both parties including a catapultand also included the&nbsp;2 awsome Vladek banners. Still some things I miss here: an extra horse to pull this huge wagon and a prisoner would have been welcome too. I love the triangular shield of Rascus in this set instead of the square shields that are used normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks: all present in this particular set for lots of playing fun and like most other Castle sets a good addition to your other sets. And if you let the Shadow Knights take Rascus as prisoner, the missing horse problem is solved too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks: I paid something like €12,50 for this set, the asking prices go from €14,00 until €28,00. I think an average of €17,50 is in place and for that price you get a very decent set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
