The strucutre of bricks is very unstable. When a part breaks it is very possible that you destroy half of the wagon trying to fix a part - a shield for example. I do not know why this happens, but the same is also for other Kinghts sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The good part about it is the 2 shadow knights and of course the king with his golden crown. the bad thing about it, it could have been built better. But you will get get fun out of it so buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Its a bit unstable but still ok I give it a 9/10 the ram works realy well and its fun to play with I like the big sheilds on the side of it. This is a good set im glad I got it for christmas",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"merkinized75","2008-12-12T13:01:00.89Z","good, but needs some more soldiers","This set is nice. It contains a siege tower, 2 evil soldiers, sir Jayko &amp; king Mathias. Ram works very well, but it does not go far. Bridge falls off easily and the figures are great. I fixed the bridge by lifting the top floor a little bit so it can hold the bridge. It has a staff with plate so it can magic shield itself like in a comic in those instructions. NO STICKERS!
Pros:
-Jayko&#180;s armor, shield. helmet &amp; sword
-king&#180;s crown &amp; golden sword(pretty damn good!)
-evil soldiers
-tower design(very sturdy)
-gigantic shields-BIIIIIIIG!
-some nice banner spears
-nice boulder ram

Cons:
-evil guys should have come with shields
-king should have come with armor

Overall:4/5
fun to build. I recommend it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
