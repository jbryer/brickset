The cave actually is just a passage though so I put the wall section on the back so it really was a cave. The giant scorpion is cool. all in all a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

-Tower looks really evil
-A lot lot of cool dark red and black castle elements
-Hanging prison gives the tower an evil sinister look with its flames
-Nice gate opening function
-Cool mini catapult on top of the tower
-Nice side tower and rocks
-Flags are a soft plastic (durable)
-Jako and Danju minifigs are cool with their helmets, armor, swords and shields, and nice hawk and wolf detailing
-Valdek looks evil with nice red and black color scheme and cool scorpion detailing
-Shadow Knight and skeleton are also included

Dislikes-

-Needs another Shadow Knight
-Scorpion is hard to pose
-No interior

Overall, this set has many more good things than bad.  It looks evil, has all the things needed for a prison and more, plus it was easy to add a little bit of interior decoration.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"dsg13x","2010-01-22T16:37:32.543Z","Most cool and a must have!","I personally love the hanging prison cage! Nice!  I will use this design over and over again.  The knight minifigures are a nice array in this set as well.  The set is interactive with a draw bridge, catapult, horse catapult, and prisoner cage.  The colors are great and the set is sturdy.  I could have used a little more floor space for figures.  The buildable scorpion mount is the best part of the set! it looks cool and finally something out of the box as a mount!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2012-04-03T19:05:46.743Z","Scorpion Prison Cave Review","<p>I just recently rebuilt this in my collection and realized it is one that I hadn't listed myself as owning, until now. It's a set that was gotten back when I was married and my now X wanted it for the Scorpion and Scorpion Warriors. I'm partial to it as another Castle build in my collection and I do love the named characters that were part of the Knight's Kingdom series and theme.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in a large booklet form with LEGO's easy to follow step-by-step illustrations. A minor complaint for me is that the use of grey and black in the instructions are colored by a light grey and dark grey that can be confusing when coming back later to rebuild a set and all the pieces are mixed up with other sets.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 280 pieces in this set. And at $40, I'd almost say it's too much til taking account the horse figure you get, and several specialty pieces for the rock base of the tower, the fence pieces, stairs and castle walls and turrets that make up this set.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's a total of five minifigures in this set. Two scorpion warriors, one of whom is Lord Vladek with the armor and helmet. There's the purple knight with the wolf emblem who's captured in a cage and the blue knight with the eagle emblem. For the life of me, I can't remember their names, other than I loved seeing more named characters from LEGO. Last is a skeleton minifigure that lays out in front of the Tower Gates.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>Surprisingly, while the Tower seems so simple, there's a lot going on for it and plenty of detail that keeps it to the simpleness of Classic LEGO and Castle builds, but enough articulation and details that brings it forward to the 21st century (2005) that it's still very engaging and very enjoyable.</p><p>The set is built in various stages. <br></p><p>1st) The horse has a catapult build that's attached to the saddle. In terms of actual practicalness, it's still a very fun idea and to my memory, this is the only set to feature this sort of mini build.</p><p>2nd) The large scorpion mount that one of the scorpion warriors rides. This is pretty good. I love the articulation of the tail and the use of pieces for the claws. If there had been more smaller sets with this build, that would have been a frightening army to send after the Knights. Jayko and all of his buddies in their colored armor.</p><p>3rd) The Tower while simple, looks perfect with how it rises up out of the rocks and the details of the wall pieces and turrets that make the task of rescuing a fellow knight look daunting. I do like the small catapult build at the very top of the tower, and the chain prison hanging out off to the side. The Gate to the tower, while a daring build, seems too flimsy with the use of black fence pieces for it. It's still a very good build over all.<br></p><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>As I write this review, I'm reminded of picking this up from a Grocery Outlet where, when they did have LEGO sets available and we'd pick them up, they were often marked down. So I don't think I paid the full $40 for this set.</p><p>For the Knight's Kingdom theme, this was one of the larger sets that could be gotten in this theme and for Castle period, it's a good build. I'd almost like it if at some point if LEGO revisited this theme and these characters. Still, like City, Castle is a standard classic of LEGO that should be revisited every few years so that each generation of children have a chance to get in and get some Castle sets to build with.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
