"ZO6","2005-07-29T15:09:53Z","Very impressive","Set includes:
-967 pieces
-8 Minifigs (the 4 knights, Vladek, and 3 shadow knights)
-Tons of extra goodies

During my first build through it took me aprox. 3 and a half hours.  It was a very fun build but not difficult.  During my second build it took me 1 and a half hours to build. (mainly because of how i sorted the pieces)

As you build the castle you quicly realize that it is going to be pretty big.  It is quite an impressive sight when you are finished as the castle is very big.  It measures about 65cm across and about 35cm tall.

The castle does not have a real back side to it but the set is designed to easily come apart in 3 sections (the right wing, central tower, and the left wing) and then the two wings are hinged at their mid points so you can easily re-arrange the castle any way that you want and make it so that every angle of the castle is protected from entry.

The two castle mounted catapults are powered by elastics and work very well.  You can effortlessly send the fire ball things at least 4 feet.  

The drawbridge is fun to raise and lower and the mechanism to do so works very smothly.  

There is a destructable wall that is very well hidden on the right wing (if you are looking at the castle from the front)  Using the battaring ram or one of the catapults you can knock over the wall.  However on the other side of the wall are scorpions to attack the intruders.

There is a bucket full of flaming material located above the front doors.  Rotating a lever can send the flames down on someone below.  There is also a handy thing located above the bucket so that you can easily refil the device.

Some other points of interest in the castle are a rotating wall (it has a skeleton on the other side), a spider web, a crystal ball, adjustable spears, and then there are a few other things as well.

The boulder catapult that is pulled by the horse works very well.  With some simple techniques you can easily send the boulder to knock off the giant Vladek mask and then it works so well you can easily get the boulder clear over the top of the castle.

The cart that launches the projectil works really good about 60% of the time.  You have to flick your finger back really quickly along the gear to send the projectil flying.

The little catapult mounted on the horse works surprisingly good.  Since the projectil is soo light it does not do really much damage but they do fly really far.

Overall this set is pretty sweet.  Im 16 years old and i have had this castle from a month now (as of writing this review) and i still get a kick out of the castle and its many functions and play with it every day.  My only complaints would be that i wish a few of the wall were mad up of more pieces (instead of one large wall piece) and the gold armour stuff on the projectil launcher cart thing looks and feels and little cheesy but other than that this castle completely rules!  Now i want to get all the other Knights Kingdom 2 sets to go along with this.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-11-16T22:29:32Z","The Best Castle Set in Years","Ive Waited years for a half decent castle set to come out since their fall in about 1997. And I think the wait may just be about over. Firstly like lego claim, I believe it IS the biggest lego castle ever since it is MUCH bigger than it looks in the catalogue or on the front of the box.

I mean, when I first saw this set I thought it was awesome but I did think it was just one long wall. However, this castle has lots of depth. It has multi leveled floors and two sets of stairs, one on each wing. I really like the roof part were all the battlements (or Ramparts) are. It is so huge you could easily fit a hundred minifigs up there!

The best part of this set that it has the old castle wall pieces! They are awesome and it has 6 of them and four corner ones. It has about 10 balcony pieces/turret tops! It also has two newer castle walls with arched window, two rock wall pieces (in a delicious brown colour) and two smaller ones, five sloped stone wall pieces (like the ones they had in the Ninja sets), a rotating wall, an arched wooden door with door frame (Like in Harry Potter sets), two suare doors, 3 pillars (Why not four though?) and tons and tons of black bricks and arches. It is simply huge.

To get an idea of the size of this set, one of the wings is bigger than the new harry potter castle! (longer and wider but perhaps not taller)
Then when you think about the fact that this is only a third of the whole castle, you realise it is going to be BIG.

A couple of other things I should point out:

Good things:
- It has a brown half barrel/wash-tub which is great for medievil scenes.
- Vladeks soldiers are alot nicer with armor and and shiny helmets!
- The catapults are amazing! They really shoot far and are very well designed.
- The fire-ball wheel things are a very rare piece and will be my new escapement wheel for my lego clock. (Eric Harshburger uses this part for his full scale grandfather clock)

Bad things:
My shiny soldiers had the greek loking helmets not the old tupe like in the catalogue! dam! 
The shooting thing is really poor as it doesnt work well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zek","2008-03-26T21:30:39.483Z","Super Fortress","Well I have to say this is one of the best castle sets in a while. It comes with 7 detailed minifigs, the knights look great with each one with there own sheild and helmet designs Vladek minifig looks awsome.

Te castle it self is massive when finished and has alot a detail and great colour scheme to it. The flags bring up the detail of the castle and the catapults work well, the Vladek helmet on the front looks crazy.

The only faults I found with the set is the drawbrigde is unstable so is the big swords at the front and the horse with the catapult attached to it. Overall a super set

"Dragon_fire","2008-06-13T12:11:13.67Z","HUGE (but still really detailed)","This castle is really big and it can be put together in slightly different ways as well. one complaint about it, the drawbridge is a little flimsy but other than that it is awesome.

it has two horses which is always cool, it has loads of minifigures (and a skellington!) it has three catapults which are brilliant, they shoot really far, and a really cool hot rock dropper thingy.

the castle itself has many really cool hidden features (e.g. breakable wall, false wall, etc) it is quite tall, it looks taller than on the box.

A bit pricy but it is worth it because it is AWESOME!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T14:27:59.107Z","i like it","the title says it all I saw it in the old lego shop in the bullring and I never even had a knights kingdom set but I got it. It has loads of great pieces and like the exo force base it can be used for any theme but requires some alteration. This set is realy good but it does have some tiny flaws which aren't even worth mentioning.

get it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Doek5554","2008-12-21T06:54:26.31Z","Sweet!!","I got this set for my birthday and i loved it! I think it is weird that the castle can fold up into a square. I don't really use it for a castle but more for a mansion for Bruce Wayne. The part i love most is the room with the crystal orb on the table. I also like the basket with lava in it above the draw bridge. There a lot of smaller rooms around the castle. All in all I give it a 5/5 and i think everyone should get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Snoopy82","2009-02-04T14:06:45.047Z","One of the best","This, along with the Marina from 1994 and the Airport from 04/05 is one of the best sets LEGO has ever made. It's huge, with so many features they're all impossible to list. Definitely buy it if you have a chance. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dentarthurdent","2009-03-20T22:41:44.34Z","Mmmm. Wonderful! Wunderbar!","Vladek's dark fortress, simply put, is an awesome set for one to own. It's big, it's cheap, it looks impressive, it doesn't fall apart, it's flexible and most importantly, it includes all the important minifigures from the Knights Kingdom series. Lego don't often do all that in just one set, but this set somehow made that exception.

The playability of the set is not limited in any way, that is to say, it's perfect if you have got a castle for the 'good guys' so that wars can be waged in an appropriate manner. The Knights are noble and the Evil King's out to rule the world, so you've got to stop him in one way or another. By-passing the molten lava waterfall however, might be a bit of a problem...

There are a number of assets to this set simply in its features - the catapults, drawbridge and other accessories extend the playability while the Knights - since you get all of them - ensure that the set is worth its $150 price tag. (although I got it for only $98)

There really is nothing to complain about this set. It is undoubtedly the best villainous residence released by Lego, mainly due to the comprehensive inclusion of minifigs as well as the solid structure and its dark and eerie appearance. This set is well deserving of a perfect 5 largely due to the fact that it is flawless and a big step ahead on the 'bad guys' front in Lego Castle history.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gi_deon","2010-07-12T09:55:05.99Z","More than AWESOME!","<br>If you look for a really good dark side castle, then this is the one for you! <br><br>The cool thing about the minifigs are that there is a four vs four battle which is considered even with all those catapults on both sides! <br><br>The building experience is amazing! Love all those castle windows and foundations! They are great for making your own castles (which I like to do)!<br><br>The only thing is missing from this castle is a jail... <br>&nbsp;<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"sonsofhk","2011-03-20T16:27:41.96Z","Great Castle, with some faults","<p>In terms of sheer size and look this is a must for someone's collection. The dark red on black scheme works nicely and lets this set stand apart from the other castles. The overall look and design of the fortress is menacing, making this one of the more intimidating castles Lego has released.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are however some undesirable aspects to this set. First and foremost are the hero minifigs, who look more like the Power Rangers than Lego knights. Their color schemes are woefully out of place not only here but in most sets that they are included in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two large swords in the entrance of the castle look absurd. They make it look more like a castle from 'He-Man' than a Lego castle. This seems like an example of trying to add too much to an already terrific set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally the number of villain minifigs is poor. For this being one of the largest castle sets of all time, there should be more villains occupying its walls. I really miss the days when Lego would give a full complement of 12 (8 soldiers four knights) to occupy the castle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value is definitely worth it, especially nowadays when it seems you get less and less from Lego for the price as the years go by. You get a broad range of good parts for this set; I think dark red is a very nice color that you will get much of here. And of course, as with most castles, the building experience is top notch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I could buy it without the silly hero minifigs, but hey, thats what Lego prison is for.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Ernst","2011-06-13T07:53:47.907Z","Great Bad Guys Castle","<p><b>Overall 5 bricks :</b> A great Castle to build and a must have for a Castle fan like me also because it is in my opinion really the first big &quot;Bad Guys&quot; castle. It looks real dangerous in the black/red colours with an impressive entrance although the big swords are a bit overdue.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks :</strong> Building it is big fun and a lot of work since I bought it second hand with all pieces loose. Not an easy set to build for the youngest Lego fans.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks : </strong>Great parts such as the pillars both the big and the small red ones, grey stone walls and the heavy wooden doors and lots of banners. Like said before missing is a jail, but maybe Vladek does not take prisoners.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks :</strong> The set is very playable, even more if you combine with other sets of this serie. That can compensate the fact that are a bit too few of Vladek&#39;s soldiers. It would also be&nbsp;nicer if the Vladek soldiers had more weapons beside the axes.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks :</strong> Value for money is 5 for me because I bought it used, combined with some other sets. The normal going price in Holland is about &euro; 65,00 for this set, I paid less.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So overall a good buy and a great set to own !!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Great, tons of big parts, castle panels, very large plates, staircase, large doors, very big slopes, collumn, balconies, the assortment is impressive and will allow the building of huge models. Large amount of weapons as well. Besides the swords and axes carried by the minifigs, there are also many spears used in the models and a few extra crossbow.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>the weak point of this set, minifigs have no prints at all, though the colour could be interesting. the bad guys all have the same head, even vladek... on the plus side, they all have an armour, which come with 6 different patterns including 5 printed ones. there are also 6 different types of helmets, 6 differents types of shields, and swords come in 5 different colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quite easy, some may say juniorized due to the amount of really large pieces. It&#39;s not quick to build due to the amount of pieces, but it grows in size quickly.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model is a beast. It is enormous. I mean, I began with one of the side sections, and it was already the size of the ninjago fire temple. It even dwarves&nbsp;a set like kingdom joust and is easily twice as big as other sets in the same price range. I recall measures being 64cm large, 38cm deep, 38 cm high.</p>

<p>Playability is high with many war machines, many way to enter the castle, including a swivelling wall and a sliding wall, a working drawbridge and&nbsp;possibility to drop boiling oil on attackers. It also has a lot on indoor space, and though not a ton of details inside, probably more than in many other castle which have little more than walls and towers. On the minus side, the bad guys are far too few for a castle that big, and a flag get in the way of one of the catapult on the castle. Also, pity that the ballista isn&#39;t spring loaded.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Certainly great as a playset, and it almost feels like a 200&euro; set because it&#39;s so big. Make sure you have a lot of space available. Note that the plain minifigs should earn this set a rating of 4/5, but the impressive amount of content for a set in this price range compensates for this.</p>

"Lego_Photos_X","2022-09-10T18:20:52.003Z","Huge ""Bad Guy Side"" Castle","<p>I am really not one of those who like bad guy and good guy sides, but this one... I gotta say, that it looks just like one from the &quot;bad side&quot; (I like to call these just kingdoms, like in the 80&#39;s they were).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start off from the minifigs... Well I love Vladek&#39;s soldiers, but I am not huge fan of the knights. Also, there should be way more soldiers for Vladek&#39;s side. Every knight have different type of shield. There are&nbsp;so many great weapons in this set, though some of those are used in the castle as a decoration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pieces:</p>

<p>Too big... Way too big, I would say. I kinda thou understand it, because this set was made in 2005, just there could be more smaller pieces to make it harder. Some of the pieces are awesome, like wall pieces, those piles, banners&nbsp;and some others, but I have really nothing else to say about parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Castle overall:</p>

<p>I love it! It&#39;s huge and there is so much place to create your own things (inside the castle). I love how the front looks like, especially entrance. There are a lot of weapons used in the build, which looks just fantastic. It&#39;s just so huge castle considering the price of it! If you are a fan of Lego Castle (like me), you should totally get this one! I would say 9/10, because of the minifigures.</p>
