I must, however, register that he is generally not the best of the knights. The only thing new about this guy is the crown, and lacks in his own color scheme. I'd take off that cape if I were you, it just doesn't go.
All-in-all, it's not bad, but don't buy it if you're looking for something impressive.....

Its OK for what it is my 7 year old really enjoys playing with the knights.  The pose alot better than the old Galidor figures the improved the joints of the dudes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:19:34.843Z","Galidor - King","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  King Mathias is a late addition and probably one of the best of the lot.  His action figure includes cloak and a crown, something that is missing from the other 5.  The gold-printed blue bricks also attempts to tie in to the rest of the non-Action Figure theme.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily, even with the cape acting as a &quot;stand&quot;.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.  However, this set is visually appealing enough to overcome a little of those disadvantages.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-06T13:41:29.513Z","Bow down to the King","This set is better than the earlier versions of KKII 'action figure' characters as it contains actual bricks. King Mathias here reminds me of the Tin Man because of the face. One of the finer and more royal like sets for the 'action figures'.
