"mrmitch","2007-07-07T22:26:07Z","Cool color - arm moves for sword fighting action","Danju is one of our Knights in the collection. Like all of the other &quot;big&quot; Knights my only complaint is the shield will not stay on as it should. You can pose the figures in unbelievable ways and as long as the are balanced they will stand up. Cool if you own a few or all of them, you can create some pretty cool fight scenes. My seven year old son loves these Knights and plays with them often. Good set to collect if you have young kids.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:08:11.687Z","Galidor - Purple","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  Danju is the purple one.  His action figure includes a rather intresting match of purple printed bricks.  The shield looks interesting, but it is disappointing to be made not out of plastic, but cardboard, and the clip looks a bit weird as well.  The helmet is interesting as well from an action figure point of view.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Hedgehog87","2009-06-28T17:21:38.28Z","My favorite knight","I still rememeber my exicitment when i got this....of course i was younger

pros: EXCELLENT color scheme, purple and yellow are great together, and i like how his symbol is a wolf.

Con: the sword is a bad color which doesn't fit the rest of the set, and his mask isn't as good as the other knights
