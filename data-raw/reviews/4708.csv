Like the other Knights the shield will not stay on very well, I leave it in the box along with the collector cards. We do have every Knight in the series and my 7 year old son loves to act out scenes with these guys. Great for serious LEGO collectors or those who want to keep young ones busy and away from your more delicate LEGO sets.

"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:10:16.357Z","Galidor - Sky Blue","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  Jayko is the sky blue one.  His action figure includes a rather intresting match of sky blue bricks with gold highlights on the shield and the sword.  The helmet has a nice swept back look.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

The sword is cool, but no the better in this line, have a different color comparing with the complete set, used too in the eagle symbol. This looks like very lego, having yellow face and bricks compatible with system, creator... The white is nice, and the moves that the knight can makes is very cool. The shield have a different shape, and it's putted different as in the 05' series. Is very poseable, playable, useful, and is made with imagination, and work of some designers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
