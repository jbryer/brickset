Cool face like the way the arms, legs and all the joints work on these big action figures. You can pose these guys in some really cool positions. Only down fall is the shield will not stay on as it should. Little kids like these size figures.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"greg_duncan","2007-10-08T19:41:25.873Z","Definitely for the little ones","I got this guy back at the end of 04 and looking back now I have no idea what possessed me to buy it. I really am not a fan of the Knights kingdom, but this set is okay-for little kids. Now I feel silly playing with it and it really is useless for mocing parts so I am left thinking that my age group is not who this set was made for. I don't really want to rate it too harshly, so I'll give it a three just because I think kids can have a lot of fun with it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:12:22.513Z","Galidor - Green","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  Rascus is the green one.  His action figure includes a rather intresting match of green bricks with canary yellow highlights that makes it seems at home in a forest.  The design of the shield and the sword is also interesting, although again the shield seems a bit weird with the clip on.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Green and Yellow are a match of heavenly harmoniousness. <br></li><li>-The sword is cool, as it is curved. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The fall-off shield is truly worthless. <br></li><li>-I don't get why there are red connector pieces. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is awesome, but it does feel like Lego was too lazy to make the connector pieces any different than what is in the final product. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
