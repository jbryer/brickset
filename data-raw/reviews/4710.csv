"mrmitch","2007-07-07T22:32:41.903Z","Santis is a Must","We have the entire collection of the big Knights. Santis is my sons favorite (not sure why). These action figures are very poseable and contain some unique LEGO pieces. Still disappointed in the shield and the way it is attached to the arm, it falls off if you look at it the wrong way. Santis is a must to complete the &quot;big Knights&quot; collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-11-28T02:14:43.28Z","Galidor - Red","There must have been quite a bit of leftover Galidor parts for the birth of the 6 Knights' Kingdom action figures.  Santis is the red one.  His action figure includes a rather intresting match of red bricks with grey highlights that makes it look like a walking fire truck.  The beige bits that are thrown in also makes the figure seems rather weird.

As a static action figure, this set has quite a bit of posability - there are joints all over the place.  However, it is not bottom heavy and will tend to fall rather easily.  There aren't any action features, no firing cannon, no glow in the dark stuff, nothing.

As a construction toy, this is bland.  None of the parts can be reused to build anything other than the main model.

Overall, these Knight Kingdom figures are a failure both as a construction toy and as an action figure.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically you get the main body/torso and limbs to pop in for the ""build"", sword and a card board sheild. The head just looks eh without the helmet being down. It's fine if you want to set them around to pose, I just highly regret having gotten these in the long run.</p>",TRUE,1,2,1,2,2

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The odd color scheme looks really cool, and new. <br></li><li>-The sword-swinging function is really fun.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The fall-off shield is flimsy and cheap. <br></li><li>-The model looks a bit unhuman to me. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>This set is cool, as are all of the other sets in Knights Kingdom II. However, since I got it at a discount, it enhances the product somehow. <br>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
