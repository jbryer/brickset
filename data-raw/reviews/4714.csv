"BrickPimp","2006-07-14T00:37:24Z","Great set full of parts for mecha articulation.","This is a very neat little set. The wolf is a clever build even if it does look a tad mechanical, but is very posable and very playable. The viking minifig is great for his face, the horns and the metallic look helmet and three weapons (spear, sword and axe).<br><br>What I like most about this set is the parts - it has 8 pneumatic t-pieces and ~12 1x1 plates with clips. These alone make this set fantastic for articulation parts if you enjoy building minifig scale mecha. I picked up at least 5 of these sets for this very reason.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

"omgbrick","2007-12-29T16:21:50.7Z","Poseable but fragile","For Viking lovers like myself this is a definite troop builder set. Costing a mere 7 dollars it included a Viking warrior with several weapons and a stationary shield. The Solider has a regular metallic Viking helmet with attachable horns; he has a printed torso with a black breastplate over top of it. There are three weapons a two piece axe a sword and a spear. Also there is a large Bionicle piece being used as a shield, but because there is nowhere where the minifig could pick up and carry it, it would have been better if he had been giving a shield like the ones in the Viking ship just so he could carry it to different battlefields.
The wolf is an interesting build that uses a lot of Technic pieces for joint mobility. The legs are built using a lot of black Battle Droid arms and T pieces. The legs are very poseable but often rotate around which can be annoying at times. The tail can also rotate but often it falls out. The head is attached using a Bioncle ball joint so it can rotate in different directions. However has no lower jaw so it canâ€™t bite onto things like Viking, still seeing that it this is only a 7 dollar set I won't dock points for that.
Overall this is a good troop builder with the included Viking being useful, and it never hurts to have a pack of wolfs to terrorize Vikings. I docked a mark for the shield and the wolf having some fragile parts. 4/5

"Jedi_Master_Fangorn","2007-03-29T17:22:15.863Z","Okay set","Small, really small.  

The good:
- jewels
- plenty of weapons for 1 guy
- wolf, which needs help but I guess it does the job
- armor for the warrior

All in all, not bad.  I used it as an army builder, and put the jewels in with the ones from the Viking Fortress set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-15T17:16:35.123Z","Fenris wolf against the viking","This set is a small set of the vikings theme. This set includes a viking warrior, really good designed and a nice builted wolf. The wolf not looks like much a wolf in the body and legs but still good in the color, building, playability and in pieces, because they are so useful. The minifigure is a basic viking, that also have a horned helmet, a axe and a sword, that makes a cool effect on battles like a viking against a beast, these pieces are also useful. The set also have a bohrok kal shield from bionicle theme combined with a spear, another feature that is also useful to sets like this. Overall, this set is so much cool, good builted, designed and playable. So, i rate it 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-08-01T06:41:12.92Z","That is one big Wolf!","This is basically the smallest set of the Vikings line. It has 1 viking, and a wolf.
PROS:
Cheap way to get a viking
Superb wolf: Much atriculation, and looks so good. Red eyes, and very useful pieces.
Two red diamonds
Spear, sword, and axe, plus armour, which looks rusty.
CONS: The shield thing is pretty useless, i have no idea what it is for.

OVERALL, a 4, because it isn't spectacular, but very good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T17:59:07.53Z","Really cool wolf","I got this about a month prior to its release (which impressed everyone I knew!) and I still think it was a great deal!

The set has one minifigure, a shield like object, and a mid sized wolf with tons of parts. The set also has plenty of accessories making for great playability.

The minifigure is cool and a feirce fighter, but the armor takes away from his torso. The axe is really cool and so is the helmet!

The wolf is highly posable and has many joints. It is surprisingly sturdy and makes for a great lesson in building legs using &quot;t&quot; peices.

All in all a good deal for the price it was!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-27T13:17:41.233Z","""Snaaaarrlll!""","Um, I couldn't think of a title. This set is great. Probably one of the best Viking sets. You get 1 Viking, but he's really bulky with all his armor. He also carries an axe and sword. But I really don't understand the shield. It's too big to carry, so I just think of it as some type of outpost or guard station. A sentry in other words. 
But the real reason why one would get this is for the wolf. Actually, it's too big to be a wolf. More like a tiger, bear, or jaguar. In the picture, the snout looks really long. But in reality it's relatively short. The eye brow is also at a steeper angle making it look more evil and dangerous. The head, either way is really detailed. It also has attachable fangs and ears. I still don't like the cross axle eye, but it's fine, I guess. 
The legs are probably the weakest part of the set. And by weak I mean badly designed; they support the wolf very nicely. They're also poseable, but the large holes seen from the front are ugly. But they did a nice job of capturing a paw. Not much to say about the body, but it is higher in the front, giving it a hunch. The tail isn't at all poseable, but it doesn't effect the set much.
Overall, great. It's brilliant for such a small set. I definately recommend getting it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
