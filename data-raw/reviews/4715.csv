"merkalK","2005-10-23T07:23:03Z","works for me","The idea of two boats combined into one longboat is quite good and works in the old pirates line as well. Set should have come with extra peddles or a sail. What does come with is 3 figs, axe, sword, 4 shields and 2 gems",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"omgbrick","2007-12-23T00:05:18.14Z","Hoist the sail... never mind break out the oars.","The Vikings theme although it was short lived it was one of my favorite themes and this set is no exception. First off the set includes two Vikings each one has a metallic helmet with horns. The first one is fully decked with chain mail even his head has it printed on he also comes with a two piece axe featuring a metallic axe head. The second has a printed axe strapped to his torso and one of those ugly Knights Kingdom swords. Both warriors are have useful parts in them plus they can &quot;borrow shields&quot; from the side of the boat.
The main boat in this set is made up of two Pirate row boats attached together with a mast piece in between them. Although there is no mast Lego still was smart enough to put some oars into the set so the Vikings can still get around. There is also a paddle being used as a rudder which will be useful. At the front of the boat there are some Viking horns being used in a figure head. A string is also attached to the boat at each end and runs through the mast.
A Wyvern dragon is put in the set for playability measures. Its wings are made of a small thin plastic. It looks okay but it can be hard to balance it at times.
Overall this is a good set like the rest of the Viking theme. It contains some good parts and some clever techniques. Even if the ship had a pole that a mast could be attached to it would be okay. Other than the dragon can be somewhat hard to balance at times it’s a very good set. 4/5

"David1971","2007-03-13T07:31:36.513Z","Good for the price","A good set for the price, although i never like it when you get a whole chunk that's basically readymade - like the boat is - rather than being made of conventional Lego pieces. On the other hand, that would be hard, especially in a little set. Two vikings and a dragon make it good value anyway.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"rabk295","2008-07-18T13:06:39.997Z","Cool Set","This is a cool set that goes really well with the larger viking boat. There are 2 very small bad things: 1)The front does not look like a dragon head, but LEGO did their best since it had to be small, And 2)The string for the rigging frays really easily and when you cut the string so it isn't fraying, the string gets too short. Otherwise, this is an awesome set that is really fun to play with. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T18:09:33.967Z","Cool ship, but a Wyvern isn't technically a dragon...","This is a pretty good set (I compliment whoever made the &quot;hoist the sails&quot; pun) and is well designed. Though it doesn't have the detail or the glamour of the larger boat (but what does?), this boat (not ship) is still good for its price. The Wyvern (which isn't really a dragon so to say...) is a little less detailed, but it is still an enemy (but two to one isn't very fair, now is it?). The boat is just detailed enough to attract buyers on a budget, and the two boats are a great deal, especially for rebuilders and designers. The ship has positionable oars, both with oar locks, and a rudder/oar in the back. The front may not be a dragon's head, but something that large on a ship this small would be obcene, so what you see is good enough. The set has plenty of weapons so that makes up. If only this series lated a little bit longer...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-29T15:10:15.17Z","Not the Best","Title says most. Here's why:
First, the Wyvern: Small. It's close to the small black dragon in the Viking Fortress set. I must say, though, the blue and yellow do go well together (my favorite color combination). The tail is small. It could have at least had another section. The legs are awful. They use the battle droid arms and a small horn. They really aren't made for standing the dragon up. The wings don't offer any poseability. The only thing they can do is swivel up and down. The neck doesn't turn, but the head itself can turn left and right.
Boat- Actually, it's more of a canoe. It's made from 2 rowboats with stuff in the middle to connect it. The gap between the boats is covered by a shield. There are also 2 oars which are fastened into place, but can still move. There is also a string that goes from the headpiece through the top of the mast and connected to the back. The mast (which, for some reason, the picture lacks) has a flag on the top. I'll usually connect the dragon on this when displaying. the set.
Overall, 4/5. The pitiful dragon and sad little boat mark this set down. But it's still good. I'd probably wait on getting this. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-21T11:48:36.163Z","LEGO Vikings - Viking Boat against the Wyvern Dragon Review","This is my first and only set which I got from the LEGO Vikings theme. The built of that set is fun and easy but this set almost doesn't have any play features. You also get a few stickers which you've to put on the shields on the right and on the left side of the boat. This boat comes with 3 paddles. We get a smaller one in brown and two bigger ones in green. The big mast piece is a very cool big piece. I think it's the longest piece we get in this set.<br><br>The dragon which we get is awsome as well. It's small but it looks so cool with these fins and the design that LEGO gave this dragon. But the dragon is a little bit too small and I think the 2 vikings which come with this set will win against this creature. The first vikings which is included in this model is the one with the green legs, green arms and the serious look on his face. The other one has a wild looking face, gray arms, black pants and a red belt. This set is a really good set. It's sad that I this is my only LEGO Vikings set yet. I hope to get the whole bunch of them one day.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

Minifigs: Vikings 15/10 These Vikings totally rock. The Helmets are amzingly detailed as is their axes. I love them.

Boat: 10/10 The Boat is a nice design and easy to build. It has good details and is a good addition to any boat collection. It looks very medievel.

Dragon: 10/10 It's another awesome thing. A cool dragon. The only thing wrong with it is that it's face isn't very detailed. Other wise it's good.

"LEGOParadise","2010-08-31T08:52:29.07Z","Vikings Ahoy!","<p>This has to be the best small viking set around, heres why:</p>
<p><strong>The Ship</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;ship is cleverly designed and includes a clever building tecnique;combining two pirate row boats together to make a viking longboat. The join is covered&nbsp;by a pair of shields and two diamonds.&nbsp;It also has a figurehead which is in the shape of somesort of dragon. The boat has no sail which is a bit disapointing however it does have oars and a rudder.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Dragon</strong></p>
<p>On the box it looks like the dragon`s wings are made out of that material Lego use to make capes but its auctally made out of a flexibal plastic. The structure of the dragon is made out of technic pieces,two fishing rods and battle droid arms. I found out that you can clip the viking on the back of the dragon as if he is riding&nbsp;it. Also, if you happen to look up ""wyvern"" in a dictonary you will find its not <em>exactly </em>dragon. <strong>Tip</strong>-the dragon can be hard to stand up so just turn the tail down and problem solved!</p>
<p><strong>Cool&nbsp;Parts</strong></p>
<p>4 Blue Diamonds</p>
<p>2 Dark Green Oars</p>
<p>4 Shields</p>
<p>1 Double-Headed Axe</p>
<p>1 Light Grey Sword</p>
<p>2 Fishing Rods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The added playtime to the fortress makes for a great battle scene and a person can add medieval knights or pirates, the possibilities are endless.

"jeroenaa95","2012-06-01T07:44:09.1Z","nice, little boat with dragon!","<p>I bought this set in Legoland Billund in 2005. It is a nice set, with a small boat and small dragon. I love this set partly because of the dragon and partly because of the neat boat. I think you get a nice set for €10-15. You get 2 vikings. It is a nice extension to 7018, the large ship and a giant snake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- Dragon!</p>
<p>- Neat little boat.</p>
<p>- 2 vikings: 1 with a large axe and 1 with a silver tinted sword.</p>
<p>- Not too expensive in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>- There are just no cons, except one wing of the dragon has a strange shape, so it doesn't really fits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a nice set which is worth buying.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
