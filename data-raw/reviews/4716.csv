Pro's:
- Dragon is big poseable and looks great with lots of swooshabilty.
- Theres no major junorization.
- Set includs two vikings not one like on the picture plus    weapons 
- Rare dark Gray chest with jewels.
- The catupult works well with ammo clip
- Vikings catupult looks good and could be usd in other themes as a seige weapon, with minor adjustments.
Con's:
- Ammo clip is fairly small and runs out fast (three missles)
- White spikes and fire chip off easily
- another viking would be nice but not neccary.

In the end this is a great set with lots of playabiltyfor thirty bucks its a pretty good deal. get it if you see it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tonga256","2007-09-17T03:12:54.217Z","it looks cool but...","when I first got the set for my birthday the box looked bigger than I expected. I thought it was a realy good set, but when I was building the dragon the pieces didn't click in and they fell off. For some resone it doesn't fall off any more. I think I sould laeve the rest to the good and bad things chart.

GOOD.

wheels foll easly,

big thing at the front is good for defence.

BAD.

pieces fall off when tour building the dragon,

the helmets never stay in one place,

it takes three or four try to actually shoot the sooting things,

when the shooting things shoot they don't actually go that far, about thirty one center meters. (not verey far)

and that why I have to give it my lowest rating yet, three out of five!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Dragon_fire","2008-08-29T06:31:51.81Z","a good set","This set is pretty cool, The weapon fires quite well and the dragon is excellent. There is two minifigs with it which is alright. The catapult thingy is very sturdy but there isn't that much space on it for the minifig. The dragon is awesome, only one complaint, the neck keeps fallking off mine, they could've done a better job attaching it, other than that nothing wrong with it. You get a good variety of pieces with this set and all in all is a pretty good set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-25T15:28:43.42Z","Slay The Dragon!!","This set would be nice just counting the minifigs and dragon, but with the catapult in with it, it's just plain awesome.  I like the mechanism for shooting the catapult (the same on the Fire Hammer from Dino Attack) and the details on both dragon and catapult.  Unlike what the pic suggests, tis set actually has TWO minifigs, the other one has a sword and shield.  Pros and Cons:

Pros:

Detailed dragon

Dragon can pick up anything

TWO minifigs!!

Treasure chest

Details on catapult

Cons:

None!

Too bad this is discontinued.  I'd tell you to go but it if it were still available.  But you can try Bricklink or eBay anyway.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Kalhiki","2009-12-01T17:31:31.797Z","My favorite Viking set","This is my favorite Viking set. It has a brilliantly designed dragon and neat catapult/crossbow. First I'll review the catapult.
It's interesting. Not the greatest, no, but good none the less. Its hollow design makes it look old and not very advanced. The brown front gives it a wooden look, and also has a shield in the center. The front also has 2 horns. The side contains the 'pilot's' seat which can hold one Viking. Going to the back, you'll see a strange chain connected onto 2 tubes which are connected to the main body. This, I suppose, is to give it a crossbow look, but I just think it looks goofy. On the bottom, you can also store the treasure chest. The catapult also has wheels so it can be mobile. The flick fire is a simple mechanism. Just pull back a springy thingy and, when let go, it will hit the missle causing it to fly out. This then will make the magazine go down providing for a rapid fire function. The only problem is that it will sometimes get stuck.
The dragon: This is why you got the set. An awsome dragon. There really is no function on this guy. The head is nicely designed, but still has the axle eye. It also has an opening bottom jaw with three teeth. The top jaw also has 6 teeth molded into the skull. You also can then pull down a hinge and attach 2 fire pieces to it. You can, however leave the fire in and still close the mouth. The body is well built, but at times the neck and spines (along with the head spines) will fall off. Of course, there are 2 rubbery wings with spikes on each wing. The wings are on ball joints providing for awsome poses. The legs are all the same, but are a bit short. The tail isn't very spectacular and doesn't have much poseability.
Overall, a great set. I highly recommend getting this set. You get a great catapult and an awsome dragon. Probably the best in my opinion.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
