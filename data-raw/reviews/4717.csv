positive:
1. many shields and specific viking equipment
2. perfect longship design (from the bow to the tail with the enormous sail)
3. the price per brick ratio is the best in the viking-series
4. nice construction: midgard-snake

negative:
1. How could Lego forget about the rear-rudder? 6057 had one!
2. less bonus equipment (then in earlier sets)

I hope that Lego will hold up to this series. And maybe they could introduce some more Viking-Enemies (more realistic ones, like battles against the british island, etc.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"brickzone","2007-04-14T10:45:58.647Z","Well decked out","I didn't believe this ship could be as good as it is - so I waited till getting a cut price one. But it is worth every cent of the full retail price.

* The scale - I did not realise that not only is this ship wide-hulled, but has three mid-sections between the two end pieces.

* The Vikings - These guys are awesome, each with its own colours and individual dress, but yet they look like a coherent Viking horde! I love the mottled metal effect helmets, armour and axes.

* The Serpent - This is a seriously involved construction with the sections articulating up and down as well as revolving - there's some kind of clever ratching to allow set positioning of the sections; they stay in place when positioned. The pieces are useful for anything from little boats to space ships, and the creature is some size as mentioned by others.

* The sail and look of the ship - The sail is gigantic, must be the biggest ever. The ship passes off well as a longship due to the look of the sail, size of ship, shields along the sides, tall prow/stern and the dragon figurehead and tall platform at the back. I love the details like the fireplace &amp; chicken, weapons stands, beer/water tap on barrel, etc.

* Pieces - all manner of useful intricate little parts, it took an age to put together, have a look online at the part inventory! 40 white horns alone! The brown bits are great for customising too. The alternative idea on the instructions shows the versatility, using part of the ship sections for a port/dock/quay. There are a reasonable amount of minifig accessories

* Arrow launcher - perhaps not realistic, but a fun and mechanically good item!

Cons: These aren't enough to bring it down from a five in my opinion, you can easily add the features yourself: It'd be nice to have something more on deck; looking at drawings etc., I think you'd want a bigger canopy or &quot;tent&quot; than just the fireplace. There aren't enough Vikings to crew the ship really - I'll either get some more or use scurvy non-descript anonymous pirates - but I think maybe it really would have been the warriors doing the rowing to keep fit (plus would you waste space on just rowers?), so maybe it would be better if I can buy some Vikings on their own.

I'd like the Vikings to have some kind of human opposition, or just people to loot and pillage. Without these, there's no-where for the ship to go, and no-one to put in the cage. But I'll build something myself for now of course :) Maybe a round tower and monastary from some castle bits?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2007-07-26T13:14:35.597Z","Wow... Just plain Wow!","This set truly is awe inspiring. This has to be the most reviewed model I have reviewed to date and I think I could write a book on it, but I wont.(Poor Verifiers)
Also it's hard to say what others haven't already said so maybe I will extend or add.

Well to put you in the picture the serpent and boat are approximately 48cm or 19&quot; for you imperial people long and the boat is about that high as well. The sail spans just over a whopping 30cm or 12&quot; or 1 foot. The detail in this model is quite extensive and well thought out. Plenty of room on the deck with the added bonus of food and drink.

Plenty of armoury on the boats outer and some massive fire power inside. A giant missile launcher aught to do the trick. Holding 4 missiles at a time gives that back up if you miss. I suppose this is better Than cannons and is trying to represent flaming arrows but obviously that would be too dangerous for a children's toy.

The cage is quite curious. It has multiple purposes and I feel they need to be explored.

Firstly - It's Not a diving cage to new age but dose bring about the possibility if something was dropped in the harbour it could be retrieved the water being shallow and all?
Second - An excellent way to move treasure or friend or foe off another ship?
Thirdly - How about instead of walk the plank, I just drown you? Works for a viscous viking, works for me.
Forth - Sacrifice to the serpent. Then he may ignore the boat?
Fifth - Lowered into the water at shoulder hight would make a convenient bath?

My best guess I feel is hold up a mutinous crew member or thief and or drowning him.

The amount of figs surprised me. Six all up so exclude your captain and captive your two ors short. If the captain rowed as well it would go off course so you let the captive row to make six? 

I think not he is more likely to attack the crew or if a serpent is chasing them he's thinking &quot; Hmm, stay hear and get eaten, as we will never out row that or bail out now and hope to hell that the serpent is too distracted with them to notice me.&quot; Well that's how I would see it. So in my opinion, four rowers is correct, assuming the captain man's the gun for defences against the serpent.

Anyway onto the serpent. I feel its awesomely done made from lots of actual bricks so it looks like a Lego serpent, not a plastic moulded hunk of rubbish from MacDonald's. But seriously check it out for yourself its very intricate and very possible with a jaw that opens 90 degreases. 10/10 for the serpent.

Two small things - 1. Needs a rudder (Obviously Forgotten in 578 other pieces) 2. The mast is slightly wobbly due to its height but that's no biggy. 

Oh almost forgot the crane mechanism is brilliant. Its on a ratchet like a boat winch witch again shows the quality of this model

Well I think that is all that can be said. As a whole this set is a 10/10. Full marks and well designed. I think this set really shows the quality and ingenious ideas that we have all come to expect from such a quality company. Good Work!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Zac","2021-03-29T22:51:01.977Z","Excellent idea, poorly realized","<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The short-lived Viking line of 2005 and 2006 stands out for the novelty of its subject matter and for the strength of the prints and parts developed to enrich its historical setting, and less so for the design of its sets. 7018 Viking Ship challenges the Midgard Serpent offers the larger of the two longships developed for the line, the other being 7016 Viking Boat against the Wyvern Dragon. Judging by the other reviews, 7018 has been well-received, but it suffers from structural weaknesses and an overemphasis on its projectile system. Current aftermarket prices on Bricklink seem entirely disconnected from the set&rsquo;s lack of merit.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The Vikings are remembered in the popular imagination for their longships and coastal raids, so I find it puzzling and frustrating that the Viking line was dominated by missile launchers, siege machines, and dragons. That the line&rsquo;s largest set was 7019, an octagonal reiteration of Fort Legoredo, rather than a more fully developed longship was a missed opportunity. 7018 has the scale and ambition suitable for the largest set in a line, but appears to have been designed with the number of parts appropriate for a medium-sized set.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Bounty of parts . . .</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The longship&rsquo;s hull consists of five pieces: two identical pieces double as bow and stern, with three middle sections. The middle sections are the same as those used for pirate ships, but the bow and stern were developed specifically for this set. They appear in two subsequent sets in different colors, but were only available in reddish brown in 7018. The two sections of 7018&rsquo;s mast are the 2004 mast patterns, rather than the older classic Pirates designs, and are unique in this set in tan. Relative to their predecessors, the 2004 mast patterns are markedly structurally inferior and cannot be readily attached in a sturdy manner to each other or to anything else.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Other new pieces and prints include the massive, stiff cloth sail; the Viking helmet; the white horns mounted on either side of the helmet; the axe heads; and the shields mounted on the side of the longship, printed with four varied patterns. The hand-held shields use stickers. The large oars&mdash;four in dark green and two in reddish brown&mdash;are an unusual treat. The speckle black-silver plastic used for the helmets and the axe heads was, I believe, new in 2005 and must have been developed for the Viking line. Each of the six Vikings sports a new torso print, which are beautifully detailed, and some of them have new heads. Much of the set&rsquo;s attraction comes from these new pieces, prints, colors, and re-colors.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>. . . but poverty of design</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The design of the longship compares favorably to historical models, with its banks of oars, side-mounted shields, and single large square sail. Relative to the ships represented in the Pirates line, longships had relatively flat hulls and would seem to be inherently more suitable for representation using Lego because they conceal a smaller portion of their bulk below the waterline.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The parsimony of the designer in holding together the longship&rsquo;s five hull pieces, however, results in an unstable model prone to breaking apart. Each pair of hull pieces is held together with two 2x4 bricks on the bottom and a single brick, usually a 1x6, on the top. The clutch power of the bottom of the hull pieces is less than usual, and if one were to attempt to pick the longship up from one end or the other the it would fall apart. Similar problems plague the dark red decorative upper continuations of the hull fore and aft: these will fall off or break apart at the slightest touch. The two sections of the mast, by their very design, cannot be easily secured either to the deck of a ship or to each other. In 7018, the sail can easily topple over, or the mast break in half or disconnect from the hull. Structural failures abound in every aspect of the longship&rsquo;s design, and its so obviously uncovered hull pieces lend the set an incomplete quality.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Other aspects of the longship have more to recommend them. Around the mast stand a firepit with poultry roasting on a rotisserie under a striped awning, as well as a keg of what is no doubt water. The winch mechanism mounted on the mast works well. The missile launcher is indestructible and, as I recall, effective. It uses one of the springy minifigure mounts designed for the Soccer line. The red dragon head that ornaments the prow of the ship creatively uses a second molded head as its lower jaw. I had and have no interest whatsoever in the so-called Mitgard Serpent, but it is structurally sound, highly articulable, and can fit a minifigure in its jaws.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Play value</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">No doubt many children playing with 7018 enjoyed launching missiles at a watery serpent, but my play was and is less projectile-oriented and I quickly removed the launcher. Without what was clearly intended as the set&rsquo;s primary play feature, it offers fewer play possibilities. The rotisserie and the winch are enjoyable, and the chest of blue gems gives the Vikings something to dispute, but the longship itself requires structural reinforcement before it can be used in a robust manner. Moreover, it offers fundamentally the same play experience as nearly every other Vikings set, which feature similar projectile launchers mounted on ships, wheels, or fortifications. Such robust projectile launchers appear to have been <i>de rigueur</i> in 2005; note them on the contemporaneous Dino Attack line&rsquo;s jeeps, tanks, and helicopters.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Compare 7018 to its smaller counterpart, 7016, which consists of two rowboats joined stern-to-stern and connected by a mast and a piece of string. 7016 is a gem of a set, suggests classic Castle design, and produces a more distinctive longship profile, largely due to the string. Play with 7018 is directed towards the projectile launcher; play with 7016 is open-ended and encourages imagination.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">7018 offers a promising idea and excellent parts but a poor design, apparently the result of piece constraints and an insistence on the elaborate projectile launcher and serpent. Two stars.</span></span></span></p>

I also enjoy the Firing mechanism which is unrealistic, but it is a great play feature. The cage is also a cool idea. I enjoy making up characters and putting them in the cage to play with. The fire and spit are one of the coolest designs by LEGO I have seen so far. I also added some things to the set such as an oar holder for when all of the vikings need to fight. Some of the small bad things are the mast (it sometimes breaks)and the firing mechanism (somtimes the missles only go 2 inches or they don't fire at all), but don't let that get in the way of your fun.
