"merkalK","2005-10-23T07:04:08Z","Completed my Viking colllection with Viking Fortress ","It took me weeks to find a store that carried this set. The fortress consists of 4 separate sections. Front gate, back cage with catapult and two identical side walls with small cats. The sets comes with 6 figs and two dragons, lots of weapons including multiple axes. 

The Fortress lends itself for some great modifications for example its easy to modify the cage into a keep or a barracks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedi_Master_Fangorn","2007-03-29T17:20:03.643Z","Huge set","This is a really excellent set!  It has, among other things:
- surprisingly large dragon, with cool wings
- very cool system for locking the walls together
- 6 Minifigures!
- very neat bone and shield decorations on the sides
- 3 catapults!
- good balcony right in front of the biggest catapult for the leader to watch from
- new IRON ROCKS!
- lots of weapons

Need I say more?  I use it with the Vikings being Rohan warriors from Lord of the Rings.  A definite 5 from me!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-07-27T17:51:22.39Z","Go Vikes! ","This is a very cool fortress and I haven't seen one this good since Fort Legoredo. You get alot of Viking minifigures, a dragon, catapults and much more. I like the doors with the shields on them which makes this very cool. This is a great set and a good buy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2010-05-28T14:43:12.03Z","A mighty fortress with an open roof for dragon attacks","<p>I thought I finished my Vikings reviews, but I guess not. I loved Vikings, due to its cool creatures, and this set does not dissapoint... for the most part.</p>
<p>The building experiece was... Oh, forget it. I don't remember what it was like to build it. I'd imagine it was somewhat repetative with those walls, but the cataput looked fun to build along with the Fafnir.</p>
<p>I'd do the minifigs, but frankly, there are too many to go over. They're all cool and look battle ready with their heafty weapons. </p>
<p>I will go over the Fafnir though. Faffy is a neat, green dragon- the one you'd probably always see in the movies. It has the same head design as the&nbsp;Nidhogg, but with a bulkier bottom&nbsp;jaw. Its neck also is very long and a little weak. You need to either hold the head in place or have the head held up high. Is boy is very long and thin, perfect for a dragon. Sadly, the legs are a little small for him. They were fin on the Nidhogg, but reusing them for this&nbsp;dragon is a dissapointment. Like the neck, the wings are also pretty long. This time, though, they aren't as loose. They are very neat pieces to say the least. The tail is, you guessd it, long and doesn't have much poseability.</p>
<p>The fortress is good for defense agaist enemies, but flying dragons it is not. It has a nice wooden post look for the walls. Sadly, there isn't much detail except for the occasional shield, torch, or spear. The door is very nice though. It has some horns and shields. On the inside, it even has a lock, which is just a a base plate that can&nbsp;swivle and&nbsp;sit in a groove to prevent the door from opening. On the opposite end there is a small cage where you can put the small six-legged dragon. This also has a similar locking mechanism, but there is no swivel. You have to take out the base plate manually.</p>
<p>On the left and right sides, there are two small catapults that fling grey minifig head pieces. Above the cage in the back, there is a massive catapult. It flings boulders that are colored with a shiney, metallic plastic. The cataplut is also very armored. </p>
<p>I don't remember how much this cost, and Brickset doesn't have anything on it. So, the most I'd pay would probably be 70-80 dollars at the most. Of course, cheaper is always better. Overall, at the recommended price, I'd say get this. The dragon is a nice design and it has alot of minifigs to eat. The dragon can eat them, not you. Don't eat minifigs.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Planetsbend","2010-11-18T21:23:43.187Z","INCREDIBLE!","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>One of the most amazing sets of all time! I absolutely love the detail on the dragon and the amount of playtime associated with this set. The intricate swords, shields, battle axes, and the treasure all contribute to this sets' incredible value. If you ever come across this set on ebay, give it a bid, it will be worth your while.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"braycraft","2011-06-24T02:05:27.577Z","ONE OF THE BEST LEGO SETS EVER!","Find and buy this set.&nbsp; It is a magnificent piece.&nbsp; Though it is rare, it offers a fortress feal only comparable to the Western Soldiers Fort.&nbsp; It fells Viking, it looks Viking, the characters are awesome, and the set as a whole offers almost everything that makes Lego fun.&nbsp; The ONLY drawback to this set is the awkward connectors between the walls.&nbsp; It makes the set somewhat unstable.&nbsp; However, this set is very easy to store, display, rearrange, etc.&nbsp; It seems as though Lego learned the problems&nbsp;from the connectors of this fort and corrected them in the connectors they used in the more recent Castle sets.&nbsp; Lego should have continued with this theme.&nbsp; All of the Viking sets are worth buying.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"jeroenaa95","2012-06-04T06:56:01.52Z","Best viking set ever!","<p>I bought this set a few years ago and I still love it. It is a nice and realistic set (except for the dragons). It costed me â‚¬70 and that is a great price. (The king's castle from kingdoms is smaller, but more expensive.) It comes with a huge dragon and a baby dragon. There are 6 vikings incuded in this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- Huge dragon!</p>
<p>- Baby dragon!</p>
<p>- 6 vikings: 1 with golden tinted helmet and sword&nbsp;and red shield, 1 with two small axes, 1 with a small axe and a silver tinted sword, 1 with a silver tinted sword and a blue shield, 1 with an armorplate, silver tinted sword and yellow-black shield with runes and 1 viking with an armorplate, large double bladed axe and a yellow-black shield without runes.</p>
<p>- 8 large shields on the walls, the gate and the caapult.</p>
<p>- Giant gate.</p>
<p>- 1 large catapult and 2 smaller catapults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>- If you have all the viking sets (like me), you don't have enough space to put all the vikings on the walls. </p>
<p>- In front of the large catapult there is a spot for the viking general, but if you put him there, the catapult can't turn. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a nice set. It is the best viking set and it stands high in my top ten of best lego sets ever. If you don't have it yet, buy it! You will not regret it. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
