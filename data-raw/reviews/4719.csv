"Martin","2005-09-04T17:58:35Z","Great set with good selection of parts","This is one of my favourites of 2005 so far - the lion is just superb.  Great value for money with an excellent selection of parts.  Nice use of alternative coloured elements where they are hidden from view which means a broader selection of pieces.  The two instruction booklets also show some good alternative models.  Designer sets are proving to be a great range.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2005-10-21T10:32:30Z","A Roaring Success","I normally only like building machines and not animals, but as a cat person I bought this set for the lion which is, as the previous reviewer says, just superb. I made a slight modification that I think enhances the appearance by substituting white eyes for the green ones provided. There are also several other animals that can be made - some with full instructions and others just as ideas. I will not be making these, but consigning the remainder of the parts to the spares box. I concur with the previous reviewer that the set is a good source of parts and will no doubt provide lots of fun if you wish to make all the animals or anything else.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-03-26T07:41:59.09Z","solid set","as the other reviewers stated, the set is highly favorable. 
just 2 remarks: its a pity that the other 2 featured animals beside the lion (hyena and vulture) are much less detailed and complex in buildung and  appearance.
the other issue: note how the building technique of the lion reappears in the dragon of set 4894, especially the torso, legs and feet, and the head with movable jaw.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Creatables","2010-01-12T17:47:54.343Z","Designers edition","We at Creatables.se love this set of inspirational Lego. The models are beautiful and possibilities for new models of your own is endless. Well worth every penny and a great inspiration in our industrial design office. Found it in a remote Toy store and bought it on a hunch. If you can get your hands on it, don't hesitate to buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
