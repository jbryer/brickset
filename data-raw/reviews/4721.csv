----------
Cost: 2 : Very expensive, for what it is 
$0.10 per element ($69.99 US / 729 elements)

Aesthetics: 2 : This model looks better than it is, the forklift itself looks okay, but the interior is a bit empty, not great detailing and the overall model just isn’t that exciting

Elements: Standard stuff

Technical: 2 : Could have been better

Engine / Drivetrain: none (an simple 2 or 4 cylinder engine would have made this set better)
Suspension: none
Steering: rear wheels, hand of god off the roof of the cab 
Actuations: The fork lift boom is the best part, unfortunately it is a bit wobbly. There the crank/gear set up to actuate the boom is cool, but the boom is deployed using thin cables, it would have looked and worked better if chain links had been used instead, also the model uses an unrealistic two position “latch” on the cab of the forklift to tilt the boom, this would have been better with a lever on the inside of the cab

Build: 2: Fast build, not too exciting, except for the boom mechanism.

The forklift was fun to play around with at first but got dull fast, it just isn’t very powerful at lifting things and is too wobbly. 

Lots of lost opportunities on this set, to recap, I would have liked to have seen an engine in this model, chain actuation on the boom lift, a lever to tilt the boom from inside the cab, and a working steering wheel... Oh well stuff to go modify :)",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

First I thought this set is is a little pricey (they still ask €50 for it) and the set doesn't have the most parts.

But due to it's play value (I like to bring my little daughter her DUPLO bricks on the pallet :-)) and the lift works really great and the Fork-Lift itself rolls and turns just fine I rate this set with 5.

Personally I think this set makes more fun than the Harvester, the Tractor or the new Cherry Picker.

Thanks for looking.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jamal_lts","2008-09-10T11:27:48.36Z","LIfts anything!!","compared to the rest of the technic's lifting abilities... this one can really lift...

i contest the Crawler Crane, the XXL Mobile Crane, the off road crane and of course the forklift.. and the forklift manages to carry above the limits of the cranes. This might be an unfair contest but look at it this way... u can finally have something the can really lift or carry &quot;stuff&quot;

and with this in mind... u can use the mechanics of the lifting system to design or modify the existing crane. 

the looks of the forklift itself is also realistic... i can really see the resemblance from the one at loading bay.

and its fairly simple to retrofit it with a power function motor.. i recommend u use the XL motor.. of course the lifting is slow.. but it sure can lift!

and the pallet is really cool... the color is just nice to make a little treehouse corner in my room.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BigMac","2010-07-20T08:18:08.803Z","Motorise the lifting machine, add remote control to facilitate the operation. Great Fun","I just bought this from ebay as an used item at a good price. I put this up immediately as I have to post a comment to the seller. I am very happy as the set is almost new and all the parts are there.<div><br></div><div>Back to the set, it looks great, good proportion at different sections of the machine and a very nice colour scheme too. The fork lift mechanism works like a real one. The ""double movement"" action of the fork ( the movement of the fork is twice as fast as the movement of the frame) enhance the playability to a great extent.</div><div><br></div><div>As mentioned by someone in this forum that the fork lift can lift a relative heavy cargo. I carried out a test of the weight that can be lifted by the fork lift. It can easy and smoothly lift 300g with a normal 9v motor. Not like 8421 or 8258 which can hardly handle anything over 100g, and of course much better than 8295 which sometime cannot lift the self weight of the boom.</div><div><br></div><div>The only con to this set is the driver's cabin is a bit empty. However, in the case that you want to motorise the machine that is the space you require.</div><div><br></div><div>This is the best fork lift by Lego ever since. It definitely deserve a FIVE.</div><div><br></div><div>I am happy to send the photos of my remote controlled and motorised fork lift to whoever wants to build something similar.</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
