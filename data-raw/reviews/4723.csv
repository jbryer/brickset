----------
Cost: 5 : Lots of great parts, a huge set for the money
$0.08 per element ($149.99 US / 1884 elements)

Aesthetics: 4 : Utilitarian and appropriate 

Form/Function: This is a large model, and the mechanisms are awesome

Elements: Good mixture of stud and studless parts, Electric motor, (same as the one used in the RC cars),  battery box, two dacta clutches, two Pneumatic cylinders, a compact turntable, and lots of gears and wheels

Technical: 5 : so great….
Engine / Drivetrain: 6 cylinder, differential to two drive wheels.
Suspension: none
Steering: 6 wheel steering, hand of god off back of rig 
Actuations: Outboard stabilizers, also driven via hand of god off back of rig , 3 stage boom (unfortunately this used a cable to actuate this and not a chain as shown in some photos), a transmission to switch the motor drive modes between the cable and boom deployment, pneumatics to lift the boom, and the crane can swivel manually 360 degrees, but is not driven.
 
Build: 5: This is a big build with great features

Steering (6 wheel): there is cool gearing to make the front most wheels turn in a larger arc than the second most and rear ones, the makes the model quite maneuverable, the third set of wheels drive a differential that connects the drive train to the 6 cylinder engine. 

The outboard stabilizers have a nice over center locking feature and are driven by a hand of god wheel / worm drive on the rear of the rig. 

The boom has three stages and is extended with the electric motor, There is a clever transmission mechanism to switch between the boom and the deployment of the cable, however this is not done independently, the intent of this was to automatically feed out the cable as the boom extends and reel in the cable as the boom retracts, unfortunately when the cable is fully deployed, the spooling direction of the cable can flip, and the boom will try to deploy as the cable is being spooled up and vice versa.

The motor is quite powerful and there are clutch packs to prevent overdriving both the boom deployment and the cable.  I like that the weight of the battery box can act as a counterbalance for the crane when lifting items. 

The pneumatic cylinders are used in a pretty simple setup to lift the boom, due to the weight of the boom the cylinders are not connected in the down stroke.

The only real complaint is that the turntable to swivel the crane is not driven by a hand of god wheel as in previous crane models i.e (8431).

"A_Brickset_user","2007-01-07T12:29:30Z","Heavy competition","This set is really something, the big mobile crane is marvelously manuverable, thanks to the three-wheel steering, it&#180;s crane extends just high enough for it to look realistic. The whole set is sturdy enough for childs play, but that&#180;s not likely is it? This crane-vehicle is needless to say beautiful, and functional too.

The assembly is a delight, thanks to easy instructions, and the technical solutions. The vehicle that bears the crane is fairly lightweight, in comparison to the &quot;crane-part&quot; of the set, which holds battery box and motor, so the Mobile Crane has a highly positioned point of weight, which is undesirably in the lifting business. No smoke without fire though, this property justifies the outboard stabilizers, which really does help when lifting sideways.

Lifting, yes, the real purpose of the set, is an sadly an Achilles heal, the crane is not strong, but Technic Lego is according to me much more than pure labouring devices, so it doesn&#180;t bother me much. The pneumatics are only connected on the up stroke, the weight of the crane is enough for lowering. I, however, strongly recommend connecting the down stroke too, thus giving the crane considerably more stability, and easens lowering of the crane, which was tricky before.

Ultimately, this set is excuisitively versatile and fun, and on a &quot;need to know basis&quot;, you just gotta get it!

"legolover","2007-03-22T18:30:39.277Z","Outstanding","This is a perfect set for any experienced Lego builder. It rates a 6 out of 5 for me. First I'll list the good things.

-Mechanics- 
This set was so well designed inside, that I was questioning myself how they thought of all of this. Being the biggest Technic set, I knew it would be overflowing with cool little things but still found myself shocked. The steering is great, pneumatics works fine, and the stabalizing mechanism had me in a bit of a giddy state.

-Appearence-
For not having a lot of studded pieces, I found this set to have a very realistic look.

Now for the bad things.

-Repeating-
I am someone who is not so very fond of repeating steps. With this set, I didn;t have to repeat certain parts, I had to repeat the whole bottom! Twice in a row, i had to repeat the bottom because of one nasty bad luck gear. In total, I built the bottom 3 times and the top 1 1/2. The half is because I started building the crane part but got bored. Then I forgot what page I was on. I had already built the other part of the crane anyways.

-Measurements-
I hated having to precisley cut the tubing to it's exact measurement. 

-Stickers-
I think this part is self-explanatory.

If there wasn't any need for the rebuild, I would probably have had more pros. In the end, this set is perfect for any collector.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dunx125","2007-12-16T12:30:37.2Z","Fantastic - Great pieces, great functions, great value. A classic set","I bought this set 2nd hand a couple of days ago, for about $730. I was first amazed at the sheer quantity of pieces - with tonnes of gears, beams and connectors. The build was very difficult, but still huge fun. It took me about 8 hours, and was very satisfying. It is a very beautiful model, with great attention to detail. I particluarly liked the choice of colours, and the placement of stickers. I will not bother to list the features, for it is mentioned in previous reviews, but I was really impressed by the system to control the crane. Anyway, onto the pros and cons:

Pros
&gt; Challenging and very enjoyable build
&gt; Looks fantastic - just like the real thing
&gt; Great selection of pieces
&gt; Loads of features, all done perfectly
&gt; Great fun to play with
&gt; Very good value

Cons
&gt; It can not pick up heavy items, as the pneumatics can not handle them.
&gt; The direction of the reeling changes a lot, making it sometimes difficult to extend th boom

On the whole, an amazing set. A great addition to any and every collection

"bizkit","2010-02-28T11:23:37.95Z","The deal of my life :))","<p>I accidentally stumbled upon this set in a shop which was selling out everything. I was amazed when I saw it. It was the last crane set in the shop and it only cost 55 euro(70 dollar). I wanted it since 2005 so I gathered my money as fast as I could, because missing this opportunity would have been a BIG mistake.</p>
<p>It's an amazing looking set, not the best but a great one. Took me 14 hours to build, because I wanted to enjoy it as long as a could. There were a lot of pieces that I've seen for the first time and this yellow color looks so nice. What I really enjoyed that they combined the older technik building style with bricks with holes and the newer beam system. I liked the old brick system more, because it was easier to creat with it, but as a collector I must say the new beams look better. </p>
<p>The best functional part of it is the base unit: the six wheel steering works marvellously, the truck is agile like a little car, at the first look it was odd that you controle it from the back, but hey can't put everything on the top of the truck; the four retracktable outriggers work fine, altho you must spin that little wheel on the back for some time for the system to work. The crane part is great looking but not so functional. I miss 2 things in it: it would have been nice to turn the turntable with gears rather then with you hand; and... the pneumatic sistem for this well design crane is wrong. I don't get it why didn't they put tubing for the lowering of the boom. It would not complicated much the actual structure of the crane... and this way it simply falls down, no fun in that, I have to catch to boom every time and put a warning for others to handle with care :). The problem could be solved by putting tubes where they are missing, completing the pneumatic system this way. I think that everybody got the extra pneumatic T piece, so hold on to it and gets some tubes (I wish I have some tubes right now). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>But over all I give it 5 out of 5. It's great to have it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"BigMac","2010-01-30T21:53:54.093Z","Best ever crane. Awesome. Possible best ever Technic","I bought this as new from Ebay for more than one year and just had time to finish this last week. I paid AUD 315, actually this is still the most expensive one I paid for, but definitely more than worth.

Before I build this one I found the Space Shuttle  8480 was the most sophisticated machine, and also I rate 8480 as the best Technic. now I think could be equal best as the second model of 8480, the submarine is also superb. Just by appearance the second model of 8421, I have not try yet, seems not as great.

Basically all the pros were mentioned by several very experienced collectors in this forum before, but I still want to reiterate several merits of the set,

1. The synchronized action of the extendable crane arms, the two arms ( smaller one inside the bigger) extending / returning at the same time. Very innovative attempt and the result is almost perfect.

2. The synchronized action of the extendable arms and the recoiling wheel of the cable for the metal hook. Good try but its not too perfect, as the speed ratio is not complying with each other.( see below for how to improve it).

3. Six wheels steering, first time in lego as I can remember, and with agreat result.

There are still two cons ( just for demanding collectors only) as below, 

1. The strength of the pneumaitic cyclinders are not strong enough for heavy load, especially when the arms are fully extended. May be in future they can use the linear actuator, which is a bit stronger, to replace the pneumatics. Don't get me wrong, I still find pneumatics are good and easier to apply than linear actuator but just not enough power in this case only.

2. I dare to say that the design of the pnematic part of ths super set was not carefull enough. To have a better control of the down movement of the crane arm, as mentioned by another review before, the air outlet/ inlet of the pneumatic pistons should all been collected, cannot have the downward outlet open. The reasons is that the crane arm is very heavy, as the down section of the piston is open, air is  allowed to release through the open outlet quickly without any control. Once the air presurre in the upward section of the pistons is leased the whole crane will bang down in one tenth of a second.

Improvements.

A. To reduce the difference of the speed ratio of the recoiling wheel and the extenable arms. I don't know wether you are willing to cut short for about 3 feet of the string. After cutting it, the hook can only reach the ground level not any further below. You have to measure it before you cut it, and make sure the length is right, as I do not know whether the length of this best quality string are of a standard length when came out of the factory. The reason is the diameter of the thread coil is too big when most of the string is returned to the coil, so the speed of releasing/ rewinding of the string would be much quicker than the extension or retract of the arms, sometimes making the movement out of control. After reduce the length of the string, it is still not 100% complying but the situation is much better and will have a better control.

B. To improve the pneumatics control, I added two air tanks to it. You may have to follow the suggested steps below, otherwise all the air stored in the tanks will released by just one downward movement. After the alteration, now,  I can have crane arm ( 2/3 extended), at least six up and seven down movements with two full tanks of compressed air.

Step 1. Plug the only open outlet on the air switch, ie fully air tight, no air can go through. To avoid the air leaking from the tanks when switching to lower the crame arms.

Step 2. Connect the air tanks and fixed at the left and right side of the crane, ie. move together with the crane platform is being turned. Comnect the hose to the pump and tanks. If you have the patience to read up to here, you should know how to connect air tanks.

Step 3. Connect the TWO open ends of the pistons ( ie one on each piston) by ONE single hose. pierce the hose (perferrably about one cm from one end, so that it can be reused in future by renmove this end)  with a thin pin, just pierce once, you don't have to see the hole, actually cannot be seen by naked eye. This is to controll the air relaesed from the pistons and hence the downward movement of the crane arm.

After the alteration, I still have to controll the switch very carefully and slowly, but its all under control. The above works quite well for my model. I don't think this alteration will damage the compressor or the pistons. Think about the recommendation to impove the machanics of your model, of course I cannot granantee anything here.

Any query write to me, may be I can send you the photographs of the alternations.

This is another  super-superstar of Technic, Great work by LEGO.

"bambalero","2009-09-06T12:04:51.467Z","Awesome Crane!","Hi everyone,

I bought this set about 3 years ago, and just recently built it again.

If you are looking for building challenge and fun, this is a set to go. As other were saying, this will take hours (blissful hours) from your time....

I like the yellow color and all the functions - on the chassis (which you assembly first for both A & B models) you can see that it has steering on 6 out of the 8 wheels - the back ones turning the opposite to the 4 front ones - the turning ratio is great, allowing you to turn the whole crane on very little space. Another function is the lowering of the stabilizers, when they are all the way down the crane won't move. Sadly the steering wheel on the cockpit won't turn the wheels but you can't have it all right?

About the crane itself - A model:

The crane goes as the boxs depicts, a long way up! - this is my first and only pneumatic set, so I am not very familiar on how pumping works. I noticed that after a while, the pumps lose the air and pressure and the crane slowly falls - I am talking that this time would be hours, I noticed it on the morning. I solved this by adding an axle that would work as the one on the hood of real cars.

The crane has two battery powered functions - one to extend the telescopic boom / string and the other to raise / lower the string. It is a pity that when extending the boom the string also moves. I would have liked to have three movements - 1) only string 2) only telescopic and 3) both.

About other features - you have a V6 mounted which looks easily when you raise the crane, although maybe a V8 or 10 would have been more believable. It comes with a sheet of stickers, I did not apply them and I think the model does not need them to look great on display.

Overall, this is a great set. Do not expect it to get it cheap, but every cent is worth it. I have not built the B model - which is a lame (personally) option for the crane. Be sure to get your hands on it if you are a die hard fan as I am sure you are!

A word of advice - dust your legos often, and try to place them in a way to keep sunlight from them - bleaching from the sun affects these ABS bricks like you would not imagine.

"the_squid","2009-06-15T11:27:09.2Z","A beast to build","When I first saw this model, I really wanted it...
Mechanical wise is it a very good copy of the real machine.

It's a big rig to build, so don't think you can build it in an hour or 2.
The build is nicely split up in different numbered bags.
Which saves you alot of time / work sorting all pieces out before you begin.

Pro's:
- It's BIG
- It's very 'real' compared to the real crane
- If you can get this one: buy it
- The steering is very nice

Con's:
- 1 or 2 steps in the instructions weren't too clear what you should do
- The pneumatics are a little light to keep the extended boom up

So I have to help her lift and lower things to keep the string from getting tangled. I appreciate the clutch pieces that they installed in the crane arm, however I don't think they are very useful in this model. The white clutch gear that drives the telescoping motion of the crane arm slips too much and it take a long time for the arm to extend or retract. I remedied that by swapping the clutch gear for a non-clutch gear of the same size. Now I just have to be mindful of the crane arm when it gets close to the min or max of its movements. The other clutch gear (the one attached to the string spindle) is almost a cruel joke. With the issue of the string/hook, you need to life stuff that has enough weight on it to keep the string from getting tangled. However, if you try to lift stuff that is too heavy it slips. It works well enough that I haven't felt compelled to swap it out for a non-clutching gear.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>
