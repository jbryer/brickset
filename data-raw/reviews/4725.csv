Good good...say, remember the instructions in the yellow box above the review page that implies ""if you don't own it, you should NOT review it, or else""? Well if you have...GOOD for you, you're an awesome person. Speaking of which, you can see I'm reviewing a now defunct Lego theme aimed at girls. Yes, I am a man, and I have...TECHNICALLY owned this set. What do I mean by ""technically"", you ask?

One day, a few relatives of ours returned home from Europe, bearing gifts from the official Lego home country. Long story short, all the little girls in the family got these jewelry-things. Passing by the living room, I saw a little plastic wrappers on the floor with the Lego Logo on it and I was pretty excited. It's the brand by the guys who make awesome castle/island/automobiles out of interlocking bricks! 

I approach the table, and noticed at a closer inspection...these bracelet things that only hold ONE piece. I was so disappointed that I had to find what fun this could be, it must be a trick! Lego couldn't make something this...lame...could they? But yes...they did. My sister appreciated the offer of this neat accessory, but she gave it to the other girls who enjoyed it more. She and I were the only ones who noticed that, but I was the only one who felt hurt at all.

REVIEW:
Ok...what do we have here? The things themselves fit our wrists and fingers like they're supposed to. But they're really just ordinary accessories. There IS a teensy little uniqueness about them: You can change the ""jewels"" with other ""jewels"" that come with the ""set"", and stack one more ""smaller jewel"" on the other. You can also stick other lego pieces on the bracelets and rings, but there is only ONE PEG. 

So if you build some non-firing Lego laser blaster, a ""wrist-com"" or something similar to a Planeteer ring, you're out of luck. The one peg won't be able to hold all that weight. The ""jewels"" are compatible with other coughbettercough lego sets which is kinda nice but they aren't as useful as...well...a one peg block, but with the little time I had with it, I can only imagine they'll work well if you're building a Lego Beauty Salon or a female custom Lego Bionicle/robot with a heart/flower chestplate...but I can't say anymore.

OVERALL:
It was a nice accessory for little girls who aren't Lego enthusiasts and will have little fun with the interchangeable pieces, but a bad idea otherwise even though the jewels are compatible with other sets. I guess the company was in a rut that they had to add this...but those days are over and Lego is doing juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust fine to this very day.

As a lego enthusiast, this set made me die inside. I kept questioning why such a great company would make something so terrible even for my sister (who was only barely into Lego), that it made their Belville sets look manly-awesome and appealing. But Lego still released more great sets that time and I forgot all about Clikits.

FINAL WORDS:
Yeah, this set was released years ago...but this website wasn't or I just didn't know about this site before. I just wanted to let out some of the old bats in my plumbing...or whatever the saying goes...

So there you have it folks, a review about one of Lego's worst ideas ever that I actually owned...technically...and I hope this review was useful to you. If not, I'll just live with it anyway. Thanks for readin'.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
