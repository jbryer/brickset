"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-19T11:38:17.857Z","A Heap of Fun","I was never too interested in the Bionicle playsets, but I received this one anyway. The first thing you notice from the box is how many action features it has. When I buy a system set, features are one of the things that are the decider of whether I buy a set or not. 

The build of this set isn't too entirely complex. There are a few sections here or there that require some attention, but most of it is basic building. 

When I finished building this set, I had a fabulous time with it. There are boulders you can launch, 'webs' the Visorak can crawl up, Rhotuka you can launch, and more. While the Toa aren't too accurate to their counterpart canistar sets, they are still fun to play with. Overall, this is a very well designed set, and never gets boring. If your simply a collector that likes to display sets, buy this anyway. I currently have it on a shelf, and it looks stunning as a display item.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set is good, includes some useful pieces and features some new pieces like the Lhikan's mask. The building is also very well and things like the spinner launcher makes it better. But the set have a problem, the minifigures of the toa hordika cannot moves and don't have some lego characteristics, these minifigure aren't playable and their arms and weapons are in a bad position. Altough this set have this problem, this set have a grat building, like the building of the towers and also the pieces, that are useful for more other lego sets and bionicle. A giant visorak (have the normal size, but in comparison with minifigures is giant) is included and like the other, have the capacity to launch spinners. The color scheme is awesome, that consists in red, gray, some yellow and the visorak have a blue and gold colors. Altough the set is cool to build, play with and includes some useful pieces, the minifigures are bad in comparison with the other minifigures of the bionicle playsets, like the minifigures of the inika and piraka, due to the poor playability and bad positioned weapons. So, i rate it 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

RUN!","The Battle of Metru Nui is a really good set,but it does have its flaws.One of the flaws I dislike the most is that it is more of a gate that the visorak can just attack from behind or bypass ccompletly.What I do is just put some empty loo rolls to form walls.I think the gold visorak that comes with this set is great but I find the thing underneath it pointless and unecessary. I like the miniture toa that come in the set complete with their own staff/lance/pointy things for them to hold.There isn't really anything special about the mini visorak apart from they glow in the dark.The firing boulders are really cool as are the ones that are relesed from the trap doors.I like the gate and the tiny winy bridge that moves forward and backwards.I would give it five however the construction is quite complecated and hard for beginners.

Overall Great set,definetly one to buy!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-09-17T11:51:16.403Z","Loads of fun","I got this set for my birthday a couple of years ago. It is very good but could be better. There are many traps and defenses including a Rhotuka launcher, twin catapults, a fold-down gate, firing spearheads, etc. The set includes a good number of Visorak including on giant one that can launch others from its underside. My only complaint is that the figs are all one piece.

Pros:
REALLY big
build took 2-3 days
good amount of Visorak
love the traps

Cons:
Toa are one piece each",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
