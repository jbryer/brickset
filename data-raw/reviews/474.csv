It would become a no-brainer for my mom to know what I'd like to order. Despite that, I was shocked when my brother got his Happymeal&nbsp;Duplo set&nbsp;with a cool sailor mini figure (1919), and mine came with blocks only, that formed which was meant to be a turtle - or so I was&nbsp;told.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had trouble seeing it as a turtle because the eye was missing the white color, and the 'shell' was not green. However, I knew Lego was capable of making white eyes and green bricks, since prior store bought sets contained these features (1544).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also was let down by the head and feet. Rigorous playability had these mentioned blocks constantly falling off. I ended up using these bricks&nbsp;to enhance&nbsp;other sets; especially sets with mini figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As cheap as a Happymeal was back in the 80's, all in all this set was one of the less appealing choices from the McDonalds promotion.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,1,3
