At first, i was hesitant about the clikits line but when i discovered their compatibility with regular system, i needed this set. This set has not increased in price ever since retirement which is sad but great for those who want it!</p>

<p>This set (sports and stars) is very cool. Every piece is easily compatible with system. The upper clikits piece connects to an anti stud and the lower clikits piece connects to one stud, although the star does not fit properly due the edges, except on a jumper. The bracelet is a thin plastic tube material, which feels a little flimsy</p>

<p>Overall, this set is great for the parts and i reckon it would be easy to find a cheap sealed copy now!</p>
