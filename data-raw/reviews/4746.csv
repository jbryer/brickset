"David1985","2007-11-28T22:00:25.763Z","Great Pieces, That's It","While I give this set (4762) a 4 that is a lopsided 4.

It's a $20 set that comes with FIVE minifigures, that's an amazing deal.  To make it even better is the fact this is the only set that has a Shark Guy and a Mermaid.  Those need to be used in many other sets, they are wonderful.

It comes with a pair of knives, and a lot of pieces in odd (and rare) shades of blue and green.

However, besides the parts and minifigures there isn't a lot to do with this set, and it's not the best design in the world.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"robuko","2008-03-25T09:05:18.967Z","One of the best Potter sets","The underwater challenge from the Triwizard tournament.  The colour scheme is very different from the other Harry Potter sets, with light, dark and transparent blues and greens and some interesting marine life pieces.  Harry has a special tournament outfit and gills.  The set has an action mechanism that catapults sleeping Ron and Hermione upwards, a chest with hidden knives, and a flick-out lobster.  Viktor Krum transfigures with a shark head.  The merperson is unusual.

The set is quite accurate to the movie, and has good playability though the catapult mechanism is a bit awkward.  It would be even better if it included Fleur.  The box is slightly too narrow to hold the assembled model.  The instructions feature an underwater schoolroom as an alternative build.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Nermal","2008-09-07T14:24:04.873Z","Surprisingly Good","When I first saw this set in the magazine, I thought it was totally stupid. But the more I looked over it and pondered, I realized that it might have some good to it. I picked on up soon after, and then I saw what I had been missing out on. The set contains an amazing amount of rare &amp; cool parts, like a red scorpion, a shark head, mermaid tail and sleeping minifig faces. The colour scheme is one of my favorite features of the set, a beautiful mixture of light blue, dark green and trans-indigo. If you need some rare parts for a pretty good price (it's $30 on Bricklink as I write this), this is the set for you. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-25T20:05:23.06Z","Good Harry Potter set","This is not very movie accurate, but it is still good. There are mamy functions and the most valuable piece here is probably the shark head. The rowboat is rather useless, so I destroyed it. The main thing is interesting with the hostage deploy system, but it breaks easily. the part with the knives is not as interesting as the main part, but that crab is awesome! The smallest part looks like it was only designed for the scorpion to deploy, put like the crab, the scorpion is awesome!

pros:
Squid
Staff
Crab 
Scorpion
Well designed.
Shark head.
Silver knives.

Cons:
Rowboat is useless.
Breaks easily.
Small part looks only for one purpose.

An okay Harry Potter set, but get a differant Harry Potter set if you can.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I actually got it for free, as my second cousins gave it to me for no reason. I'll start with the minifigures (NOTE: THERE WERE A THREE OR FOUR PIECES MISSING)<div><br></div><div>You get Harry with or without gills, a shirt with Potter on it, and swimming trunks</div><div><br></div><div>A sleeping or awake Ron in Gryffindor uniform</div><div><br></div><div>A sleeping or awake Hermione in Gryffindor uniform</div><div><br></div><div>Krum, with a torso with fancy designs, swimming trunks, &nbsp;and his regular head has a normal face with a stubble (I think there was hair, but that was one of the pieces that were lost). Krum also has this shark head you can slip on.</div><div><br></div><div>A mermaid with long red hair, a green torso, and this long tail that I think was made just for the set. You can still stick her on a base plate to make her walk, though. She also gets a blue...trident?</div><div><br></div><div>There is a big black octopus, designed well. You get a red scorpion which may be a lobster, but I like the color. And then there is a yellow crab which is new to me. There is also a blue transparent jellyfish.</div><div><br></div><div>There is three parts for the set itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Main Part: This is where Ron and Hermione are held captive. On the bottom are these archway pieces, made to look like small doors. On top is some seaweed and then a stand to hold the prisoners. The big green piece in the back is mainly one piece, elegantly designed, but then you can build this part that sticks out. You put the jellyfish here.There is a part that sort of pushes Ron and Hermione up, but that was a missing piece (Actually it wasn't, as it's several pieces, but a certain piece was missing)</div><div><br></div><div>Secondary Part: This is sort of a &nbsp;staircase. There are many transparent blue pieces besides the staircase, which is light blue. The top stair is actually a small box that holds two small knives, a cool feature. You rest the crab here. Then on the top of the staircase there is some green pieces holding up the octopus. It fits well. (Wow, I'm dumb...the octopus is the giant squid!)</div><div><br></div><div>Third Part: This is just some rocks with a cool seaweed piece on top, something I've only seen in the Spongebob sets. On the bottom is a small cave for the red lobster. There is also this piece that pushes the lobster out but it barely works.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>So get this great set. I wasn't gonna get it but if someone offers me a free Harry Potter, nay, just any Lego set, I must accept. Bye!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
