<p><em>In this review I use the term &ldquo;ash&rdquo; for new light gray, &ldquo;blay&rdquo; for new dark gray, &ldquo;clay orange&rdquo; for dark orange and &ldquo;dusty blue&rdquo; for &quot;sand&quot; blue.</em><br />
<br />
The first aspect of this set that I&#39;ll review is the selection of pieces in it (since that&#39;s, of course, what you get a first impression of when you first open the box). There&#39;s a new minifig handheld magnet piece. It&#39;s so small and simple that it could have a multitude of uses in MOC&#39;s. There&#39;s a gold ball (similar to a minifig basketball) that has a metal pin through it, so that there&#39;s an small exposed metal surface at each pole of the ball. Since this gold ball is the same size as minifig scale soccer balls and basketballs, I see a unique potential to use this piece in Great Ball Contraptions. There could be a GBC module that sorts out the metal-containing balls from the regular balls.<br />
<br />
The set comes with 2 ash B.U.R.P.s and 2 blay L.U.R.P.s. This is handy, as it&#39;s often useful to have these pieces in even numbers. The set has a few large plates: two 6 wide in black and a 2X16 in tan. There are 2 clay orange stairs. Clay orange may seem to be an odd color for Minifig scale stairs, but that piece is scarce enough that any non-pastel color is a good thing, and it doesn&#39;t take long for the AFOL mind to come up with uses for this color of stairs. There are also several other basic clay orange pieces: bricks (1X1&#39;s, 1X2&#39;s &amp; 2X2&#39;s), slopes (1X2&#39;s) and plates (1X4&#39;s, 2X4&#39;s &amp; 2X2 corners).<br />
<br />
4767 has a decent selection of tiles. There are some 1X8 ash tiles that make up the bleacher seats, as well as a couple 1X4&#39;s and 1X2&#39;s. (The seats have to be tiles instead of studded pieces so that the minifigs will fall off, as part of the set&#39;s playability.) There are two 1X6 tan tiles, which can be hard to come by. The three 2X2 printed tiles that go above the bleachers are quite nice. I think that their use would be constricted to just Castle, but they could easily be used for non-Harry Potter themed MOC&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The Hungarian Horntail dragon is a new LEGO animal, and I think they did a decent job on it. The piece that&#39;s the top half of the dragon&#39;s head has good detail printing, including gold teeth. The legs are nonmobile, which is about my only gripe for this new dragon. The bottom of the feet can attach to enough studs that this beast could easily be attached to a S.N.O.T. surface if you want. The wings are the same type as the ones in the new Viking sets; they attach via click hinges. One of the most interesting things about this new animal is the fact that it has banana pieces on its wings. Not only do these tan bananas serve as the dragon&#39;s wing claws, but their color lets you still use them as minifig food. We have a few realistic shades of minifig apples, and now we have 2 colors of bananas too. The dragon&#39;s tail is formed from the familiar base and middle pieces from dinosaur tails. The horned tail tip (from where the animal gets its name) is a new piece that&#39;s tan with a swirl of black in it too.<br />
<br />
Aside from the new light flesh skin color, the 3 minifigs are pretty nice. <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp%3FM%3Dhp075"">Harry</a> is pretty much what he&#39;s always been, except for his torso. His torso and arms are black and printed on both sides. For anyone looking for battle-damaged torsos, this one has some fabric rip marks on it. Even if you don&#39;t like the small Hogwarts logo on the front or the word &ldquo;POTTER&rdquo; on the back, you have to admit that this torso is much more appealing than the old light gray classroom uniforms. This Harry minifig is one that does not come with a cape.<br />
<br />
Mad-eye Moody is an interesting fig all around. He&#39;s the first minifig in years to have a peg leg (aside from Pirate key chains, of course). The peg leg is pearl light gray. <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp%3FP%3D973pb127c01"">Moody&#39;s torso</a> is quite nice with all its shiny silver buckles, zippers and buttons. I&#39;m sure that <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp%3FP%3D3626bpb178"">his face printing</a> will be one of a kind (won&#39;t be in any other sets). He has some scars or wrinkles and an eyepatch that&#39;s actually a gold ring instead of a patch. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a story behind this, but I haven&#39;t read the book. Last but not least, Mad-eye has <strong>dark tan</strong> straight woman&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp%3FM%3Dhp072"">Professor Dumbledore</a> comes in a nice dusty blue outfit. He has his typical long old man hair and long beard. My advice is to remove everything from the shoulders up and use this sweet legs &amp; torso combo to make an awesome Space guy. It&#39;s a shame that Dumbledore&#39;s beard hides his <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp%3FP%3D973pb123c01"">torso</a>, because it has a really nice printing. The printing is an armorish looking design that has a gold border, silver dots and a lavender background.<br />
<br />
Some other part tidbits that this set has are 1X2 plates with 1 stud in tan, a black chain, a black string with a stud at each end, log bricks in tan and a few Technic axles.<br />

<p>Playability<br />
<br />
The set is made of different free standing sections. There&#39;s the B.U.R.P. section, the L.U.R.P. section, the bleachers and then the small bowl that has the gold ball in it. The B.U.R.P. section has a small catapult on top that launches Harry&#39;s broom. This section also closes, by way of hinges, and forms a hollow rock that figs could hide in. The L.U.R.P. section has an odd archway thing between the 2 rocks. This section also folds up, but it does so in a way that leaves 1 rock&#39;s outer side showing and 1 rock&#39;s hollow side showing, so you can&#39;t make any hiding spots. The dragon has his leg tied to the base of the bleacher section. It looks like the dragon is supposed to pull on his chain, which slides out a support under the bleachers, and then fly into the flag/banner thing over the bleachers which tips them and makes the seated minifigs fall out. Right... tip something over and make the minifigs fall out. I think we could&#39;ve done that one ourselves without the moving parts.<br />
<br />
I only have a few tidbits of Harry Potter knowledge, so my speculation as to what&#39;s supposed to be going on in this set may be way off. It looks like spectators are watching while Harry has to fly in where this dragon is and snatch the gold ball, but the dragon gets loose. While the different sections that make up the set can be arranged into a semi-arena, the set&#39;s best playability (as far as playing with what the instructions show to make) is swooshing the dragon around.<br />
<br />
The set&#39;s box has 1 alternate model on the back, and I think it&#39;s pretty good. The alternate model is the set of stairs going up a rocky hill to a throne on top. The throne looks neat because it has the dragon&#39;s wings on its sides and the horns on top.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Overall I think that this set is definitely worth the money. The main model isn&#39;t too great, but the minifigs and the dragon are quite good, and the selection of parts is very versatile.</p>
