When I was first into LEGO in the 80's, I don't think a car like this would have been possible, the bricks weren't invented yet (brick 2 x 3 with curved top didn't appear in sets until 1995 according to peeron's data base). The red, white and black color scheme work beautifully and the stickers are great as well. The only stickers I have a problem with are those that go across multiple parts like the sticker on the windshield that goes across 4 slope bricks. This headlights are made out of 1x1 tiles with vertical clips and a 1x2 plate with handle. This set also has the plate with racer grill, cheese slopes and 1x3 sloped bricks. This set is an example of a great Tiny Turbo. Check out my Racers gallery on my Brickshelf account:

"Gus_263","2008-04-26T16:12:12.247Z","Well designed","This tiny set is from the subtheme Tiny turbos, where the cars normally don't have space to put a minifigure. This is the idea of the set, small car without minifigures, but this still cool, once that this is an ideal size to make challenges with much cars. The playability don't involves minifigure, but still cool for run, and for make tricks. This car, &quot;RX-sprinter&quot;, is well designed, and due to the ramp pieces, isn't retangular. The front is well made too, and these white pieces are good positioned, altough don't looks like with flashlights for cars, still cool. Ramp black pieces are good to looks like with glass of the car, and makes a good color scheme along with red and white. This have a back spoiler too, to keeps this with more design. The pieces are in a good number, because are useful for cars with or without pilots. The playability is cool, to make tricks, to make this run, and the pieces are useful. These are useful for make combination models, or too cars where can be rided by pilots, or for many things. Altough this set have a size of matchbox or hot wheels, this is very lego, and all pieces are compatible with any lego system (sometimes too with technic)theme. 
Overall: this deserves a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The wheels are excellent and the rear spoilers and the stickers given give it the 'rally' car look. However the oversized front spotlights are a terrible sight and brings down the points for this car.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Bob_Clear","2013-12-13T22:30:06.76Z","Great tiny turbo!!","This was my first tiny turbo, I got it when I was 8 yrs old and still think this is one of the best sets around. It has 58 pieces, all of which are quite small, with which you can build a small rally car. The box is cool; as with the other tiny turbos, its lid can be placed on top to create a garage for the racer. The spoiler and the head lights are movable, and the stickers are detailed. Overall, Small but Great set!<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
