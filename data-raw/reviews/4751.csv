The mudguard pieces are cool but there are only 2. You do get 6 wheels so that is 2 more than you are accustomed to getting in a Tiny Turbos set. The cheese bricks, engine, and sloped bricks are a plus as well. Honestly, though this is just ugly. The color scheme is bad as well. A new color would have been great, like a Dark Red instead of red. Unless you are a collector of this series, stay away from the F6 Truck.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-11-02T18:26:39.403Z","Strange","This Tiny Turbo is the strangest of all the Tiny Turbos ever made. The cockpit looks alot like an aircraft cockpit and six wheels is a good idea, but not on this ugly one. The color does stand out but the rest is just bad.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Pros : 
Cool front side
An engine
6 wheels
A unique part (the connecting one)

Stickers (although there are thousands reviews in Brickset complaining about this, LEGO still produce it)

"Gus_263","2008-04-27T11:33:18.64Z","Very well made","This is a little truck from 2005, at the beginning of the subtheme Tiny turbos, where cars(and also trucks, like this) were and are little, to don't have minifigure. Have a pilot isn't the idea of the set and isn't a con, because the review is made due to the idea of the set. This set, F6 Truck, is well made, with a different building in comparision with other trucks and cars from this subtheme. The ramp part on the front was made to looks like with the glass of the truck, and this is cool, once that the black makes a good color scheme along with crimsom. This don't have a ramp on back, but still good in design for a truck. Many contents on this set are useful, like the flashlight part(too included in a yellow tiny turbo of the same subtheme) and the piece where is placed the back spoiler, (one that was used very on old castle to connect carts with horses, to make chariots), and also the motor piece, to make many cars to looks like with tunned ones or hot rods. This have a good playability, due to the size, is easy make tricks or competitions with more than one tiny turbo, and this runs very well with all the six wheels.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-18T10:13:33.343Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - F6 Truck Review","This set is very nice to have and a fun build. It may doesn't have any minifigs but it's very easy to maneuver this vehicle around. We also get a few stickers to put on. I think it's a neat little set to get for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
