"Gus_263","2008-04-25T17:57:40.06Z","Hot wheels!","This is one of the firsts from the tiny turbos subtheme. Like the subtheme's name says, the sets are little(except sets that includes more than one car and have more buildings). The color scheme isn't the best but is cool, more for the light blue. This set isn't capable to have a pilot, but still cool because this is the idea of the set. This have too great playability, altough don't have minifigutre. Is easy make it run, make tricks with your fingers and more, due to the size. This is bigger than the racers sets from 2001, have more contents, but have a different idea, from 2001 were to crash and see the minifigures flying, and the tiny turbos to play with without minifigure. This is cool and the building is easy. Ramp pieces were included on the laterals, and seeing by the front, is easy see that the design of the car is a ramp, too because the set have the spoiler on back. The wheels are putted in the same plates of older cars, being useful for small sets. In the orange plate piece on the front, is easy put a claw piece, connected with other cars to run one and make run the two. The playability is good, the contents too are useful(don't for minifigures), and the color scheme don't the best, but the color scheme don't justify the whole rate, so, this set deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"asianlego","2008-10-16T11:37:11.34Z","Splash Buggy","I was quite skeptical when they first realeased Tiny Turbos because I am strongly attached to sets that can fit minifigs. This car however was superb. The color scheme is pastel-like and also the design reminds me of a RC buggy I had when I was smaller. The playability is huge! Even as a teenager I couldn't resist pushing the ATR 4 back and forth on the dinner table as well as pretending the ATR 4 was jumping over the air (high swooshability!)

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-20T10:14:20.263Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - ATR 4 Review","This set is one of my favourite LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) theme I've got. I like the design of that vehicle and the colors which LEGO used for this little model. It's a quick and easy build but it's lot's of fun to play with and to maneuver it. We also get a few stickers to worry about. It's a great little set to have and it's also great for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
