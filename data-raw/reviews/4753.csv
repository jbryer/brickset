I have nearly every set in this category but this car stands out to me for one simple reason, it plays like a car from a regular toy company. Once it is built, it almost stops being a LEGO toy. It is rather heavy because of the large wheels so it rolls better than any LEGO toy I have ever had. It looks sleek, all in black and using the SNOT technique enhances this appearance. The two engines on the rear of the truck are nice as well. The wedge tile used for the roof and windshield is a cool look. This set is one of the cooler racers cars out there but not the best.

The twin engines are a little odd since this is supposed to be an SUV. Besides that, this set isn't bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-10-05T08:26:43.903Z","HUGE Wheels","Not very good, this one is possibly the worst Tiny Turbos. Do not buy this set except if you want to complete your 2005 Tiny Turbos collection. I only buy it because it's on discount 67%.

Pros:
2 engines
Nice black colour

Cons:
Stickers
Too big wheels
Very small compared to the others

"Gus_263","2008-04-28T14:46:04.187Z","Big wheels, big motor","This is a tiny turbo set, from 2005, the first year of these. Like the other tiny turbos, are small(the size explain the name of the subtheme) and deserves be compared with the set ideas. The idea of the whole subtheme is make small cars, without minifigures, to be playable, stilling useful like other racers. This isn't small like others from the subtheme, but is if compared with other racers, like the power racers. The title of my review says about big wheels and big motor, once more I say, is it if compared with tiny turbos. The wheels are good positioned altough the car isn't very great(only by the wheels and the pieces to keep these), and the motor along with the wheels makes this looks like with a big foot car. The ramp pieces have different shapes and aren't big, like one to looks like with the glass piece. The details of the flashlights of the car were putted, altough pieces under a plate, next to the wheels, too are useful to looks like with that. The big contents(and the small and regular sized too) are useful to racers and tiny turbos too, to make combination models or another buildings like other cars or trucks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-20T10:09:45.713Z","LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) - Big Bling Wheelie Review","This set is not my favourite set of the LEGO Racers (Tiny Turbos) theme but it's still a great set to have. This set may doesn't have any minifigs but it's a fun and easy build. It's also very easy to maneuver this vehicle. It's a good set - even if you're looking for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms. We also get a few stickers to put on.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
