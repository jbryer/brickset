No, this is the kind of set that is like an add-on to a fortress, because this set isn’t very mobile, although it comes with nice features, and plenty of mini-figures.

 The ram itself doesn’t have much weight on it, so it won’t be bashing any doors any time soon, although it includes a very nice visorak head. The catapult is nice, as it rotates and shoots boulders well, but this being the best feature in the whole set is kind of disappointing. This set comes with every bionicle mini-figure for the year, and seeing as this is the cheapest playset available, it almost makes up for the disappointing ram, leaving me giving this set a 3.75 of 5.

So when this set came along, I was ecstatic. A large battle ram! Get 'em! After I got this set, I built it. And after I built it, I could only watch in vain as the ram part just sort of did nothing due to it's plastic. Adding lead weights improves it a bit, but not by much. If your wondering why I expected to much out of plastic, it's because I figured that the whole set was dedicated to this battering ram, so I figured it would at least work well. 

That's  not the only disappointing thing about this set. The build also isn't too entirely stable, and the spider legs can get in the way sometimes. 

There are some good points about this set, though. Mainly all the Visorak figures and green rope pieces it comes with. The silver spears are also good as weapons for minifigures, and the gold Visorak head is good for set modifications/ MOCing. 

So overall, some somewhat disappointing aspects to it, but also has a few good parts to it. Overall rating = 3/5

Yes, I know not a full fledged review of everything. Shame on me. :P

One thing that really bugs me is mine didn't come with the string with studs on the end of it. Instead they gave me a 2 by 1 brick with a hole in the bottem of it which really distracts from the main apperance of the set. All of the figures aren't poseable. The ram it self look's good but the legs don't support it, and the ram doesn't work.The catupult on top of it works very well. there still is sme good pieces the spears and golden visorak head it doese have some playibilty and looks good so it only gets a 3/5 with all the faults.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-28T13:03:07.45Z","Visorak Battle Ram","This set is a playset of the bionicle theme and was released in 2005. This includes some minifigures of the toa hordika and visorak, like other bionicle playsets of 2005. The minifigures of the hordika aren't playable, cannot move the legs, head or arms, only features a good design like the hordika and can carry a big weapon, that is bad positioned. The visorak minifigures are in a bad size, are much small and also cannot move (these not have heads, are spider like), but features the capacity to &quot;jump&quot;. This ram is made with some lego system parts and combined with bionicle parts, like the visorak head, paws and three weapons above it. The building is easy but not much good, due to the playability with it, because the paws cannot move very well. Another feature are the chains, connected with some visorak minifigures. Altough the set have some good pieces, the building is not the better, like the playability and the minifigures are bad, with exception of the little visoraks. Somethings makes the set looks like boring, so i rate it 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
