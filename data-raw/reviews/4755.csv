"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-07T05:11:19.393Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Playsets) - Tower of Toa Review","It's been a while since I've written my last LEGO BIONICLE review. This set here is the only BIONICLE (Playsets) set I've so far. It's a fun set with lot's of great play features and some very interesting minifigures. The build will take a while but I didn't have any problems with this model. We also get a few stickers to put on.<br><br>This set includes a big visorak which has the golden version of the mask from the first Makuta figure. If you push the back you can also shoot a bigger flick-missile. We also get two big torches with this set. The entrance of this tower has a very big mask piece of Turaga Dume. On the first level you can see a flick-missile which you can sviwel full 360Â°. You can also lift the big gates on the front of this flick-missile up if you want to move it. On the next two levely is a balcony. The balcony on the 4th level has a piece which you can move up and down. There's also a green string on each side which you can use for the small visorak to climb up. These visorak also glow in the dark! On each side of the building you can also see a wall which you can open if you want to enter the building. On one side you can also find a catapult which will shoot some nice rock pieces. I really can't complain about this model.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
