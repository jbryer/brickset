Actually he only got the dragon to play with, because the knight with the smaller parts is better kept away from him for now cause <span> he still puts everything in his mouth</span>. The dragon is great with its moveable parts and stuff, so great that my 3y old daughter always attempt to steal it from him while he is playing.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>dragon i really big and palmfull<br></li><li>wings are kind of flexible (kind of ball joint)&nbsp; and can be arranged in various positions<br></li><li>appropriate for early ages (the dragon)&nbsp;</li><li><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>only upper mouth part is moveable, lower mouth part and tail would have been nice too<br></li><li>i got this set sealed, but color was already worn of the dragons teeth</li><li>as you look in the dragons mouth, there is a slot to put something in there, a Flame would be nice there too&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></li></ul>
<p>Overall it' s a great great set bringing in lot's of play for the price. I love it!<br></p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,3
