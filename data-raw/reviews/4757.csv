"Monty","2005-08-15T08:11:43Z","Point off for bent axles","I thought I would update my previous review. I began to work to add those steps which do look good in my view, but discovered that after less than a week standing in one spot, the 2 front axels have bent under just the weight of the model and there is now a noticeable wheel wobble. From an inspection it seems there may be a quality control problem, as the axles do seem to be made from softer than normal plastic. Not sure where the parts were sourced as I no longer have the box. I have replaced them with older spares that do seem harder and less likely to bend â€“ so far so good. I presume if you load up the truck the problem will get even worse and this will probably adversely affect playability - so I have to deduct a point.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The wheels are massive and useful if you want to make a monster truck. The truck can carry alot which is pretty cool and deserves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>He is a pretty generic construction worker of the modern city variety; a red hard hat, orange and fluorescent&nbsp;PPE (he is safe and seen), he is too tired to shave from long shifts and goes home and enjoys a collapse in front of the TV, eats a little too much and holidays in showery coastal areas in his caravan... (no doubt). He&#39;s a decent bloke.</p>

<p>The build is pretty interesting and the parts are good despite my low parts rating, very technic and in great contract to some junior elements later on. These technic beam squares are a little ready made but are fun to clip into with the locks and pegs. Suffice to say, this all makes a very&nbsp;solid base and axles. The rear lights are basic and the functionality overtakes decoration which suits the vehicle with nice touches like the fuel tanks and chunky engine.</p>

<p>Identifiable &#39;ready made&#39; sections include also the wheel arches, safety barriers and a humongous tipping bucket that you could also use as a&nbsp;fries shovel in a fast food joint, a cereal bowl or even clear up after your dog (please don&#39;t).&nbsp;It is a bit flexible.&nbsp;I really do not have a problem with this piece at all but this large section contrast with the technic parts is a little&nbsp;bizarre. It can not be among the best vehicle builds although the bumper, cab, grill, tyres and that engine were satisfying enough. I really rate the finished model and think it would be a lot of fun for kids who love construction sites with it&#39;s orange safety light and black and yellow diagonal stripes.</p>

<p><strong>Bargain Dump</strong><br />
As usual with any truck set, it would only get&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra point if they include a drinks mug for the driver! But no harm done, I saw it for &pound;9.99 in Sainsbury&#39;s&nbsp;in 2005 and should have grabbed it then. A great year for themes and sets and I include this because it wins as a finished model.</p>

"HaulingBricks","2023-04-07T23:25:00.827Z","Dump Truck 7344 Review","<p>Dump Truck 7344 is definitely one of the largest LEGO City dump trucks. I thought.&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4202-1/Mining-Truck"">Mining Truck 4202</a> was large until I came across this set.</p>

<p>The building experience for this truck is average as it uses quite a few larger parts. Most of the build is spent providing a rigid frame for the massive dump bed to ride on. The grill and cab area are nice enough but not too overly detailed.</p>

<p>The part usage is pretty interesting for a City set. A lot of Technic elements in use and the large dump bed is one of a kind!</p>

<p>The real star of this set is the playability. It&#39;s so much bigger than your typical City vehicle that it almost feels like a Tonka truck. An axle assembly under the dump bed allows you to tip the bed and set it at that angle, which is quite fun. It&#39;s just so beefy that playtime can be more rugged than normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent over a year trying to get this set at a decent price. I&#39;m glad I own it, but it wasn&#39;t exactly worth the inflated price.</p>
