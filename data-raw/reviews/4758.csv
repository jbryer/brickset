"Blade","2008-02-27T00:56:30.92Z","Big Dinosaur, Bigger Gun","I have already posted a review for this set a fair while ago now (July - October 2007) and I noticed a few weeks ago my review for this set and two others had disappeared for no reason so I am re-reviewing this set. This set was also released here in Australia.

The vehicle itself is quite different to ones of similar type. It has guards and fairings that match in well with the theme. It is slightly longer than most, the driver/rider stands up to steer and it is controlled by handlebars. These are probably both good things if the mini-fig wished to operate his oversized blaster/ rocket launcher. The guard at the back is on a hinge to allow the driver to angle the satellite dish when he is off the vehicle.

The mini-fig is decked out in full tactical clothing with a black helmet on and a face that means business. He is armed with a massive gun, almost twice the size of him. I guess you would require a gun this big if you were to verse a mutant lizard.

The lizard is quite poor being more like a piece of rubber and only being one piece it isn't really LEGO. Still it looks good on a shelf and is near impossible to break during play.

Overall I like the look of this model but it has nothing that jumps out and says here I am. Still a nice model that fits in well with it's theme and is deserving of a 5/10 or Average. I would say get this model if you can at the right price or you a looking for a cheap way to get a mutant lizard.

"Smallsam99","2008-05-07T15:47:25.28Z","killer lizard vs. gun?","To me this set is a good set for 5 dollars and has some things in it that make it worthy of a five! To me the jeep is a better model to use for terrain than the previous and the gun is a monster! the minifigs have a cool outfit and the lizard is very interesting approach to a dinosaur. I think the set yeilds good playibility and is fun to play with!

jeep(improved)

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-30T18:29:34.747Z","Not much","This set comes with a lizard, minifigure, quad bike and bazooka. Everything is pretty cool except the lizard, you can't do much with it, no moveable arms, legs, head or tail. But the lizard is cool looking, with the eyes and jaws, I'll give credit for that. The quad bike is pretty good. It has some sleek pieces, the back component can incline, but when you put the minifigure on it, it doesn't seem to fit very well. If the minifigure holds on to the handlebars completely and perfectly, he will, however, come loose of the 1x2 studs he is standing on. There is a big blue light at the back, you can probably make up its function because I don't know what it's for. Overall, the quad bike needs a little more work. The bazooka is the best part about this set. It's long and realistic, but you gotta make sure the 1x1 round bricks don't fall off while in play. All in all average set, the price was good.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2008-11-08T13:04:35.997Z","Nice!","I love this set. It is pretty small, but it still has a really cool four-wheeler and an awesome dinosaur that comes with it. I really think that the satellite dish on the back is a cool feature. I also like the bazooka thing. Overall, this set is worth the money. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-08-01T15:22:42.84Z","Not bad... but not all too good","I got this set free through Brickmaster (FREE!) and for a set it isn't half bad, but if you were just randomly searching for sets, this wouldn't be the most eye-appealing.
The set has obvious flaws, and in my personal opinion the worst of which is the &quot;mutant lizerd&quot; (sounds like a lack of creativity, but at least they named the vehicle), the monster is not at all posable like its ancestors (classic dragons and Johnny Thunder T-Rex) and worst of all: hollow and no studs, which drops the playability of it since it can't be customized!
The dino gets a shameful 3/10, but hey, at least it looks decent, well sort of...

The rover on the other hand is pretty good (but &quot;steel sprinter&quot; isn't the best name) and is actually detailed to some extent. The minifigure is also pretty cool and for making your own figures, is a great face and torso to have!
Back to the rover, it is pretty sturdy, but the wheel clips are not, they easily bend if the wheels are taken of wrong, and then the wheels don't stay on! The weapon is beyond impractical for such a tiny vehicle, since there is no holster or turret for it, and against a monster that is apparently quick and stealthy, it is useless. There could easily have been an alternate weapon, but there isn't.

For a free set, it isn't the best introduction to the series, but for free is good for parts. All in all, if you got it free or as a gift, fine, but I pity you if you wasted money on a set that wasn't well thought out.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-17T19:55:38.327Z","Tiny","This set is very small.  All it is is a rubbery lizard and a 4wd.  There is only a stinking nut with a crazy bazooka.  This stinks so don't get it unless with brickmaster.  Again, I say do not get this set it is one of the worst.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-08T10:50:11.577Z","Great little set, perfect match for any other Dino Attack set","This set, the Steel Sprinter, used to be my little brother's but, like all of his Dino Attack stuff, he broke it up.  I got the instructions online and built it back, and found the dino in the Lego box.  I think this is a very nice set, and read my review on the Fire Hammer to see how I matched them.
Anyway, Digger's gun is quite large for a normal minifig (it must be made out of something really light so he can just pick the thing up).  It looks like a laser bazooka, really.  The dino has imprints on his feet for placing him on Lego studs, but it doesn't do much good because the imprints don't grasp the studs tightly enough to hold it up, so the dino leans back against his own rubber tail.  This isn't really good, as it's hard to make him rushing at the Steel Sprinter when he's staring up at something above Digger's head.  But the playability is was saves this set from a 4/5.  It's really fun to zoom across the urban or forest landscape and either knock over dinos or blast them with the cosmotronic ray gun.  And when coupled with the Fire Hammer or other Dino Attack set, this set zooms to max at 5/5.  Pros and Cons:

Pros:

-Playability

-Cosmotronic ray gun looks like a laser bazooka lol

-Steel Sprinter looks like a souped-up ATV

-Great backup for other sets

Cons:

-Lizard leans back on his tail

-Lizard is stiff rubber, making him impossible to pose.

So get this set, even if you don't have another Dino Attack set.  If you do have another Dino Attack set, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? ??  You can make a trailer for it on the Urban Avenger!  You can put it in the bed of the Fire Hammer!  You can load it on the Iron Predator!  You can build a cargo bay for it on the T-1 Typhoon!  The possibilities are endless!  Get the Steel Sprinter!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Atbin7856","2009-05-03T02:02:54.467Z","Not bad","I got this set from my Brick Master membership so here's my review:

Pros:
Mini figure is Spike.
Comes with lizard.
Bazooka-like weapon.
Vehicle.

Cons:
The back of the sprinter is pointless.
Also the Bazooka is little long so it makes it hard to put the mini figure on the sprinter.

Overall not bad. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dk_devilkid","2009-11-26T13:35:50.717Z","Big gun dude! I want one.","This was my first Dino Attack set. It comes with the Steel Sprinter which looks somewhat like an ATV. It has a little gun on the back. Not that you'd need that after having an enormous bazooka. It is pretty basic though. The ATV doesn't look like any I've ever seen. The Mutant Lizard is also cool but it's not posable. It's just one big piece.

Pros: 
Digger minifig with bazooka.
good for the price.
Mutant lizard
Cool ATV

Cons: 
No lizard posability
ATV is basic.

If you want a small set to start your Dino Attack collection this is a good one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Squidtron","2009-12-22T19:38:04.433Z","Perfect example of an average set.","<h4>Build <br></h4>The build of this set has nothing surprising on it, its just a simple SNOT-free build. The ""Raptor"" is on solid piece of rubbery plastic.<br><br><h4>Minifigures </h4>The minifigure on this set is below average for a Dino Attack minifigure, however, it is not bad. His face is unshaven and had a rather grumpy expression. His torso is printed with a pair of binoculars and some dark red straps. His legs are black and unprinted, but still useful for MOCing, as is the rest of the minifigure.<br>The raptor on this set is not great. It is made of one piece of rubbery plastic and has nothing to show that it is Lego. The expression on the raptor is nice though, it looks like a vicious grin, to show that he's having fun destroying the city.<br><br><h4>Playability <br></h4>The playability of this set is limited because the raptor is one piece and cannot move. Really, all one can do is chase the raptor around with the buggy or chase the buggy around with the raptor.<br><br><h4>Parts</h4>The parts on this set are not great, probably because it only includes 42 of them. The parts aren't all that useful, pretty much they're just standard 'little car' pieces, but with two of the hardest-to-use colors: dark red and tan.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"AETerry","2011-04-04T15:47:56.983Z","Steel Sprinter vs. Mutant Lizard Review","<p>Dino Attack... what an awesome series. In some ways it's too bad there were only 5 sets in the theme, but at the same time, LEGO focused on putting out some quality designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Steel Sprinter being the smallest of the Dino Attack theme, I ended up with two of it. One that I'd bought for myself and then later that year in a rant and rave to my folks about the coolness of this theme, planning to get more... ended up getting a duplicate as a christmas present when they got me the entire theme for Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATV is just a sweet little support vehicle cruizing along side the larger vehicles and helping to flush out the smaller Lizards and Dinos for capture. A design that speaks of mobility and speed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure that comes with it is cool, having a look of a special ops or paramilitary task force whose job is to contain the threat. He comes armed with a very sweet bazooka that uses the familiar ""space cannon"" or ""video camera"" accessory that has multiple uses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the Mutant Lizard is fun, even if he is a soft rubbery plastic and is one piece. He's in a pose that allows you to have him doing almost anything the imagination sets it too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set works out to being great. Making for an awesome introduction and lead into the rest of the theme if you can get it or did pick it up in the day. Or even as the revamped UK edition of Dino Attack 2010.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

<p>the gun is epic</p>
<p>the guy has a really cool outfit</p>

"K_nut","2011-02-25T11:39:37.803Z","A very good parts pack with a sweet minifig.","<p>When I found this set under my Christmas tree, I eagerly ripped open the packaging and started building. I had wanted this set for years because the theme reminded me of Jurassic&nbsp;Park and I had always wanted a Lego Dino. I hoped that my years of waiting for this set had been worth it, and they had!</p>
<h4>Minifig</h4>
<p>Digger is a sweet minifig and has many uses, such as a mercenary, army man, or his head can even be used for a biker gang member. This would be a perfect figure if it had back printing, but I'll cut TLG some slack.</p>
<h4>Dino</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;Dino&nbsp;is a very unique part of this set. It is made of the same, rubbery material as&nbsp;Yoda's&nbsp;head from the clone wars. It looks pretty cheesy but is a great part of this set.</p>
<h4>Quad bike</h4>
<p>The quad bike is an awesome vehicle for parts and to play with. The dark red and tan make a great color scheme to this set and are great for making custom things. This is&nbsp;probably the best part of the set.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>This is one of the best sets of this size for the minifig&nbsp;and quad. A near perfect set that I am proud to own and if you can buy this set cheap, you should&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;get it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
