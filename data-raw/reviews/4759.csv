THe main thing I have agianst this set is the desing it looks like a spiffy go kart with a sort of giant laser strapped to the top. But you can alter the set to look awsome it really fun! the dino in pretty good too and its nice size not to big but not to small. I would get this set it is really fun but I dont know where yo would get it now Oh well .   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2008-07-25T00:43:38.123Z","Awesome ten buck theme sampler.","I got this set just to try out this new theme back in '05, and it was pretty good. The raptor was neat, if a little Megabloks-ish, and the minifig was awesome. The cart itself is decent enough, worth ten bucks, but I wouldn't have paid more than that. 

Unfortunately the only other set I was interested in is the helicopter and I couldn't afford that. :(",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-11-25T16:04:11.233Z","Cool!","The whole dino attack theme was awesome, and this was the only set that I wanted that I could easily afford. The raptor is really cool but way too big to be an actual raptor. (Real ones were smaller than people) The buugy was pretty neat but it only has one weapon, I wish it had at least two. The minifigure was pretty neat, his scarred-up face is pretty realistic. The wheels are also very powerful. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-22T20:15:39.687Z","SWEET Set!","I just built this back today from what pieces I could find in the LEGO box.  It used to be my brother's, until he broke it up.  I'm still missing several pieces, the dark red piece that is in front of the steering wheel, the black 2 by 1 ridged bits on the engine, and the antenna.  The buggy itself is very detailed, with a cosmotronic ray gun (pretty long, fake name if you ask me) on the roll-cage, and pistons on the engine.  I have customized the buggy myself, adding some detailing pieces to the front.  The raptor is a fun part of the set, even though it can't pose like on the box :( 

Pros:

-Details

-Big gun on top

-Raptor

-Shadow minifig

-Ruff and tuff-looking buggy

Cons:

-Pieces holding rubber roll-cage to the buggy sometimes come off

Altogether 5/5.  Great set to add to your Dino Attack collection, and the Urban Avenger might even come in handy in Lego City stuff.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsstud","2010-06-12T16:34:58.013Z","First Review Can the Dino be stopped?","<p>The build isn't very exciting, but there are some unique parts in this set.</p>
<p>Shadow is the cool minifig in this set. With his cool rope torso and helmet he is a great minifig. There is also a fiercesome (not sure if I spelled it right) yellow-bellied medium sized dinosaur that is amazing.</p>
<p>The vehicle itself isn't the sturdiest but it gets the job done. It has a nice engine and a even nicer gun.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great set with a amazing minifig and if you had a chance you should get it.</p>",TRUE,4,2,2,4,4
"AETerry","2011-04-04T16:05:18.677Z","Urban Avenger vs. Raptor Review","<p>The second smallest of the Dino Attack theme, I got this for Christmas after a rant and rave to folks about the coolness of this theme and wanting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prize winner in this set is the Raptor. He's larger then the Mutant Lizards as seen in the Steel Sprinter set and is more posable with jaw, arms and legs that move. There's even a sleek contrasting coloration of black and yellow with red eyes that makes it a very cool piece and addition to the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Urban Avenger is fairly cool too, having a bit of a dragster or roadster design to it to suggest speed. The carriage that the Minifigure sits in, I'd have done more of an armored look to protect them. There is a descent looking gun turrent on top. The other part that slightly bugs me is the steering wheel build and the narrow pole that comes out for it. It doesn't look completely right. The rest though is good use of design and coloring for the vehicles of this theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Minifigure that drives the Urban Avenger has a print design to suggest special ops or paramilitary group tasked with the destruction or capture of the Dino assault and looks very good.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
