"mocha","2007-08-15T16:48:57.77Z","sick!","the fire hammer is my second favourite set in the dino attack theme. Now two the pros +cons

Pros 
Awesome design- looks like a military humvee
cool engine
big 
sturdy/ stong [I dropped of my top shelf and only a few things broke off]
raptors
cool minifig

cons
it has a lot of holes in the back
should come with another mini-fig
gun looks ugly

HOW I MADE MINE LOOK COOLER [u don't have to read it]
i modified mine by putting a base plate on the back [so theres no holes] then i put a machine gun on with a swiveling thing on it.

Overall 6/5 -well worth the money",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-11-08T17:34:16.81Z","No Dino Attack Setr is Juirorized! ! !","Dino Attack rocks!  Dino Attack was just another quick theme for Lego to make money off of like Aqua Raiders, or Vikings, or any Lego Sports theme.  However, Lego did something that made Dino Attack different from those other quick-buck themes...

     First off Dino Attack is an awesome idea, not that it's original or any thing, but everyone loves the idea of mutant dinos attacking the city.  Next, it implements cool new pieces (the dinos). And last, it is not juniorized, I can't count how many good Lego themes have fallen to juniorization.


     Now, on to the actual set I am reviewing...
#7475 is a good set, by any standard.  It features a good missle firing system (not like those stupid flick-fire missiles), solid construction, and good VISUAL details.   The interior details, and details details (I guess) are a different story, however.  Just because a set isn't juniorized, Lego shouldn't have to make a lack of details to cut the cost!  All in all, 8/10.   Hmmm, perhaps I shall look deeper into dino attack in the future.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hecktick","2007-12-18T23:37:25.733Z","One of the best sets of 05","Dino Attack was one of my favorite themes, as I am a huge fan of dinosaurs (ask me, and I could tell you a dinosaur's scientific name name and who discovered it). The heavy build of the vehicle is quite nice, although it could do with some doors. I never cared for the missile launcher on the flatbed, so I took it off and added a folding ramp to hold the Street Sprinter and some weapons racks. I also added another chair on the inside. The dinosaurs, however having horrible scientific errors, are cool.

Pros:
Nice, heavy build
3 dinosaurs
Very sturdy (I dropped it from 5 feet and it stayed together [gasp]!)

Cons:
Stickers (as always)
Lycoraptors (my name, not Lego's) are not jointed",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-02T13:18:15.763Z","Get off, dinos! Don't scratch my paint job!!  Aw, yew scratched it!","This is my one and only Dino Attack set other than Street Sprinter.  But it's my favorite, no doubt about that.  The turret on the bed is very cool looking, and even though it may not shoot as far as the Lego cannons, it still goes far enough to knock over one of the dinos included.  I use the extra darts on the side of the launcher as flick-fire missiles, but they're supposed to go into the clip when it's empty.  Viper looks like a pro at capturing dinos, and his truck looks like he means business.  The big, knobby tires look like it's a 4&#215;4 and army truck.   The dinos are cool looking, even though one's pinkish (lol).  I heavily modified the set myself, but first I'll state the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

-Big, army truck

-Turret is a lot better than flick-fire

-Three dinos

-Viper looks like he means business

-Turret has automatic re-cocking!

-Big, knobby tires on truck

-Details

Cons:

-No passenger seat (I fixed that; see below)

Okay, so here's how I modified mine:

First, I added another gray seat on the passenger side for Digger.  Then I made a trailer hitch on the back of the Fire Hammer.  Then I made an actual trailer.  It has the Alpha Team-type wheels and lowering cage bars for a rear-loading ramp.  There is a weapons rack with room for three cosmotronic ray-guns and another walkie-talkie.  Near that back is enough room for the Street Sprinter, so I put it there and put Digger inside the cab of the Fire Hammer.  There was still more room in the front of the trailer, so I put a cryothermic cannon there on a swiveling pivot with a cryothermic canister plugged into it.  There is another cryothermic canister near the cannon.  So, altogether, I have a trailer with a cryothermic cannon, an extra canister, a weapons rack, a place to put the Street Sprinter, folding-down loading ramps, and, of course, barred walls all around.  The Fire Hammer put up with nothing more than another seat and a trailer hitch.  

Try doing this yourself, it's really fun!! !! !! :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dk_devilkid","2009-11-26T13:49:43.7Z","A great and amazing set.","Let me start off by saying that this is an enormous jeep for the minifig. That isn't a bad thing. For me it's a good thing. The wheel is as tall as the figure. The big cannon on the back is also really cool. My only problem with this set is that there is only 1 mini figure. There's no one to man the gun. 

The Fire Hammer has great detail like the scratch on the hood. It has what I think is an external engine. It has headlights and a cool grill. It was also one of the most fun sets to build ever.

Pros:
purple, black, and brown lizards.
Viper minifig.
Enormous Fire Hammer jeep.
Missile launcher on the back. 
Great detail.

Cons:
Needs another minifig.

Overall an absolutely stunning set! One of my favorites I have.

"AETerry","2011-04-05T16:20:58.96Z","Fire Hammer vs. Mutant Lizards","<p>I got this set for Christmas in 2005 after&nbsp;a rant and rave to my folks about how cool this theme looked and plans to pick it up for my collection, only to be -very- pleasantly surprised with them getting the entirety of the theme for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is a medium range set, not quite an impulse buy but a little careful planning, at $20 it was well worth it in the day. Though of course, getting this set as a gift, I'm not complaining either about the price paid.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coloring of tan and a dark, burgundy red for the vehicles in this theme are great. The Hammer is like a rather large ATV; almost a tank and needs to be with all those mutant lizards swarming it. The Torrent on it isn't too bad either. I like it far better then many ""flick"" missiles that are Lego vehicles as this features a little pull back lever that will launch the missiles outwards on firing..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigure is great, like all of the minifigures in this theme with the print for a Special Ops or Paramility Team set with a specific task. All I would have done differently is have 2 minifigures instead of one and perhaps better arm that minifigure on the torrent for when the Lizards get in close.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise it is a very solid build and there's been a lot fun putting this set and others in the Dino Attack theme together.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
