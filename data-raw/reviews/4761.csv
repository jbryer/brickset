"SJPlego","2005-10-05T16:01:32Z","A Predator of Iron","This was the second set I purchased from the ""Dino Attack"" line.&nbsp; It was well worth my money.<br><br>This set includes three Minifigs: Specs the team leader, Digger the daredevil scientist, and Viper the drafted racer.&nbsp; As is the case with all the Minifigs of the ""Dino Attack"" line, these the specific uniforms worn by each Minifig is exclusive to this set and the ""Dino Track Transport"" set from the ""Dino 2010"" line.&nbsp; Do not misinterpret this; these uniforms are not specific to their set, but the combination of each character and his uniform is unique to this set.<br><br>I was particularly interested in the Mutant T-Rex included in the set, since this is one of only two sets (not counting the Dino 2010 counterparts) to include a Mutant T-Rex.&nbsp; The Mutant T-Rex is only six pieces, which is unfortunate considering the magnificent brick-built tyrannosaurs seen in the ""Make &amp; Create"" and ""Creator"" lines.&nbsp; This has always been a fallacy of tyrannosaurs in LEGO playsets, dating back to the T-Rex from the ""Adventurers"" line.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the lack of pieces cannot deny that the Mutant T-Rex looks simply awesome with sheer power and strength in its appearance, and is capable of far more poses than its ""Adventurers"" predecessor.&nbsp; The lack of tail articulation, however, places it behind the T-Rex from the ""Dinosaurs"" line and the T-Rex ""Prehistoric Creatures"" set.<br><br>The Iron Predator itself looks pretty cool, and fits the slightly-futuristic military style of the Dino Attack Team.&nbsp; There is plenty of space inside the tank, which can be both a pro and a con.&nbsp; It allows for a group of Minifigs to occupy the tank, and with slight modification a Steel Sprinter can fit inside, but otherwise this gives the Iron Predator a rather empty look.&nbsp; The Iron Predator also suffers from an epidemic known as stickers; they're a pain to get on correctly, render the bricks unable to be washed in water, and after several years they peel off.<br><br>Overall, while a little pricey, this was a pretty good set.&nbsp; I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a T-Rex, wants a LEGO tank, or simply is a fan of the ""Dino Attack"" line.<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"tonga256","2007-09-14T07:22:00.14Z","Cool set!","When I first got this set I started building it straight away. I realy liked the missile at the time and I played with it a lot but now, not as much. I like the size of the dinosour, I don't know why. Now onto the good things and bad things.

lighting up dinosour,
mooving thing that shoots the missile.

"jet94","2008-11-08T07:29:36.59Z","Big Gun?","I have the UK version which I think is better because I don't like that gun.
The UK version doesn't have the gun it has a trailer which can carry the dinosaur. I really like this set because i like the strange vehicle.

Pros
UK version dosen't have big gun
cool T Rex 
lots of minifigures
strange vehicle
cool tyre tracks

Cons
Back comes loose

I give this set a 4. But i'll give the UK version a 5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-06-06T19:08:01.077Z","Awesome set!","My little bro, Joe, used to own this set (we used to have the whole Dino Attack series), but he lost interest and broke up all of his, which were everything except for my set, the Fire Hammer.  Today I just finished building it back, and I say that it earns 5/5 rather easily.  It's a large set, and very impressive, although the treads don't have suspension.  The tank aspect to it, with the large cannon, is quite nice.  Unfortunately I don't have most of the stickers.  Altogether great set, and worth the time I put into it to build back.

Pros:

-Cannon and firing mechanism

-Machine gun on the side

-Big tank look

-T-rex to fight

Cons:

-T-rex is somewhat childish, and extremely easy to put together, consisting of only six large parts

-No suspension, but it actually works fine nonetheless, even on rough terrain

Overall, great set and worth my time.  I've added several things to it myself, and it's very capable of being a troop transport.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cadeo703","2009-03-22T10:41:13.03Z","things I like about this set","This set is one of the coolest sets I have ever had. The iron peditor has so much cool weapons like the missle and rotaing machine gun.One cool thing about the t-rex is it's light fixture.
I never had this for more then 2 months because of my siblings smashing this along with the A-wing, but thats another story",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legofan666666","2009-05-04T17:40:48.763Z","great set","THe treads work great! theres not really much to say so I will just move on to pros and cons: 

        PROS:
             like I said before, treads are great!
              big turret with launcher is great
                  gun rack on the left side
              spikes look cool
              3 good designed minifigs
               big green tank in back 
               nice looking wheel
              you can seat someone at the launcher /turret
               dinosaur eyes light up
             arms and legs on dino can move

               

               CONS:
                      treads can get stuck sometimes

                    thats pretty much it. I would get it before it on ebay or amazon if you find it.

"AETerry","2011-04-09T16:24:05.71Z","Iron Predator vs. T-Rex Review","<p>2005 Dino Attack, that was a year, especially come Christmas time and I discovered had given me and my X the entire theme as gifts after a rant and rave over how cool the series looked and plans to go out and pick it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $40, this is semi-medium sized kit going towards large, granted I got this as a gift, it's still very worth it. This was the first set opened and getting a T-Rex out of.&nbsp; This one is green, the head has a button on top to press and cause its eyes to glow red. The jaw opens and there's something of a build with attaching the head, legs and arms to this beast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the Tank... It's a fairly good and solid design with the brick red and tan coloring for the vehicles of this theme. A turrent and massive cannon on back make it so this tank can pack a bunch when facing off against the giant T-Rex. The Tank treads look cool, I don't think it's the best for functionality or realism, but with a toy, that's not really a huge issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;three minifigures, all with the print jobs for the Paramilitary or Special Ops image that characterestic of this theme. You have one who drives the tank, another who's manning the cannon turren and a third who's manning some smaller, closer range weapons for defense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But like all of Dino Attack, I really like this too.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

But after you build that pieces, it becomes masterpieces.</div><div><br></div><div>This set contained three mini figures, the uniform design was very nice and so much detailed. The Iron Predator itself are very playable and looks dashing. The tank has a rocket launcher in there with a cockpit, a steering wheel, a gun, etc. Very detailed interior in there.</div><div><br></div><div>Now the T-Rex, not much building experience in here, but the design itself was pretty good and looks menacing plus it's big. The articulation is good, but it lacks of articulation in its tail. Well, it doesn't bother me actually.</div><div><br></div><div>The minus of this set were the stickers for sure. I prefer the printed one.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this set was pretty good although a little bit pricey, but I assure you that this set was worth your money.
