I reccommend that you get it if your local trs has it. Okay now lets get to the fun part.... REVIEW: This set is absoultely great with tremendous playibility and fun rolled into a giganitic chopper! The set isn't time consuming andit is enjoyable to build. Although there is no printed bricks(how sad) the set itself makes up for it! The dinos are cool and could easily engulph a minifig which is a plus for a dino attacking lego city. Also the layout with three cockpits is a great idea and the little lab is very clever!

Figs
You got four figs yet they had all been made before so 3/5 for figs

The build was great, not too tough but enough of a challenge to keep you from being bored and at around 1000 pieces this is a long build  5/5

Dinosaurs
a T Rex and a Pterodactyl?! 5/5

Pieces  
Some interesting things but not much 3/5

Playability
I was having a hard time playing with it as a helicopter mainly because it weighs 5 Lbs but it makes a great base after it crashes ;) 5/5

"BionicleBOOM","2009-06-14T19:28:43.437Z","Tops off my collection","This is the final Dino Attack set I had to build back from my bro Joe's old sets!  Although some of the pieces aren't the original, and a bit wrong colored, I still have almost every thing, and I must say this is my favorite Dino Attack set I have other than the Fire Hammer.

I fixed the cannon problem (it goes off if you set the T-1 Typhoon on it's landing gear) by changing out the 3-axle pieces that hold the front landing gear on with 4-axles.  It lifts up the front a tad bit, and the cannon doesn't go off anymore, and you can't even tell that I've changed anything.

Pros:

-Cannon

-Machine guns on side

-Details of rotors

-Small machine gun

-Swiveling Sonic Screamers on the back

-Overall details, making this probably the best chopper LEGO has made

Cons:

-Cannon goes off if you set it down on a flat surface (see above for solution)

Altogether this is one neat set, and worth the two days I put into building it.  Superb details and awesome playability put together make an incredible chopper to play with or just plain look at.

Up, up, and away!

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I hadn't taken this apart. it was one of the biggest sets I had when I was&nbsp;6 years old and had a great price ratio&nbsp;for a set that big. 
<li>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Build</h4>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The build was interesting with some neat parts and cool features. The build never got repetitive&nbsp;and got really interesting when getting&nbsp;to the inside of&nbsp;chopper. The cockpits were fun to build and the guns had a great design that just had them clip on. 
<li>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minifigs</h4>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 4 amazing figs and a few&nbsp;interesting gadgets. The first Minifig is Shadow. He looks really cool with the chemical belt on his torso and the camo on his face.&nbsp;He is also exclusive to the helicopter set in Dino Attack and Dino 2010. The second fig is Digger. He is the first fig of&nbsp;Dino Attack&nbsp;I got&nbsp;and still makes me want him again with the headband and the rope on his torso. The third fig is Specs, my favorite Dino Attack fig.&nbsp;Amazing haed and torso. The last one is&nbsp;Viper. I love Viper with the sleeve less torso with a knife but no actual knife. Huh?</p>
<li>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dinos</h4>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The T-Rex was awsome with his light up tongue and eyes. The&nbsp;pterodactyle is exclusive to the set and looks nice if suspended behind the chopper. The two together make a worthy opponent&nbsp;for the Typhoon.</p>
<li>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Playability </h4>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The playability is great with lots of features and pieces. The missle on the front is cool and fires easy. The inside is easy to build and has cool features like the screen and the green tank. the gun Viper has is also cool. see ya</p></li></ul>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-04-09T17:45:08.46Z","T-1 Typhoon vs. T-Rex Review","<p>At $70, this was the largest of the Dino Attack sets in this theme. I must have had a second one recieved as a gift because I remember taking it back to the store (Target) to exchange it for another LEGO set.&nbsp; Me and my X had talked with my folks about how much we loved the theme and our plans to get the rest... the more I look at this to review, I recall we must have bought one and then the Christmas gift we exchanged back so someone else could have a chance at getting this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing I recall with this set, is after we had it together, my X very lightly bumped the set and it fell to the floor. I have never seen a Lego set explode into so many pieces like that and it was the lightest of bumps. So I'm not sure if all the pieces got recovered for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, it was a great set while put together, there was a lot of fun in building it. All the interior details for a seeming mobile command center in the sky as the Dino Attack team tracks down and captures or destroys the dinosaurs. Forward firing cannon, a small gun turrent that could rotate and some side gatling guns. Zip line for hauling minifigures up, down or other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are four minifigures in this set, all with prints for a Special Ops or Paramilitary team and they're all just great looking and fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you have two large dinosaur figures. One's a Pterodactyl and the other is a Red T-Rex which has a button on the head that can be pressed to make the eyes glow red. The Rex also has something of a minor build or assembly rather with attaching the head, legs and arms to the main body. The T-Rex's in this theme are just awesome and the greatest pieces I have for ... I don't know... just to have period.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I still rate this today as the number 1 Lego helicopter ever sold. The best part is the building. The helicopter is so fun to build and there are quite a few valuable parts. It is very fun to play with. One of my favorite functions is the missile launcher.

<p>Like many sets from this time period, there can be some difficulty discerning dark bluish gray from black parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The maxifig dinos steal the show in terms of parts. They&#39;re big, they&#39;re fun, they&#39;re pretty rough and tumble. There&#39;s a great mix of tan and dark red parts with the perfect splash of lime.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figs for this set seem appropriately up to the task: they&#39;re a bunch of rough edge guys ready to duke it out with dinos. I do feel like we could use one more minifig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The best part of this build is the slow realization as you assemble the structure and realize just how massive this thing is going to be. It really took me by surprise. There&#39;s a lot of detail splashed into the side gunner area and the rear facing cannons are lovely.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think LEGO has made a larger helicopter model in the system series. Bow to tip, it&#39;s about 25&quot; long. If you&#39;re an adult, you&#39;ll love the display value due to the size and maxifigs. If you&#39;re a kid (or a kid at heart), this thing is an excellent swoosher!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set appeals well to kids and adults. The size makes it stunning. It&#39;s a great build. For whatever reason, at the time of writing, this is still quite easy to obtain used quite close to the US MSRP&nbsp;of $70. I think it&#39;s a set that will build steam overtime. I don&#39;t see LEGO making another gigantic Apache-style&nbsp;chopper with dinos anytime soon. It&#39;ll play well with the rumored Jurassic park sets, too!</p>

"SoAXIII","2013-08-19T18:43:12.513Z","This is sooo coo...... it broke again","<p>Big but it was full of a lot of little pieces, it wont blow you away, but its not horrendus</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>This will come in later, but there is a lot of little pieces. Its great if you want a bunch of pieces, but it doesn&#39;t hold together like you wish it would.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>Four guys that you can get in other sets for this theme so I wouldn&#39;t get the chopper FOR them, but they are cool and do go along with the chopper very well. The dinosaurs are also top notch.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>Its long and requires a lot of technic pieces, but it is pretty fun and any lego builder would love the challenge of building it.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>This is the best and the worst part. The model looks great, it fits with all the characters nicely, it is big but not too big, and is a heck of a lot of fun to fly around, until it starts falling apart if you dont hold it right, the biggest problem is that since it is big, it comes with the fragile nature of some of the big pieces. The rotars fall off all the time, bottom doesnt sit right, in short, its not good for playing, everything else though is nice.</p>

<p>Its great but doesnt play as well as I would like it to.</p>

"LegoDavid","2019-07-18T05:20:46.607Z","The best Helicopter LEGO has ever made.","<p>This is easily one of my favourite LEGO sets of all time, if not my favourite. It&#39;s just a legitimate 10/10 set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set features 4 minifigures: Viper, Digger, Specs, and Shadow, the entire Dino Attack team. Their printing is highly detailed, even if they lack back printing. Though I personally never been much of a minifigure fan, I love those guys. They are supposed to be former army men, and I think they pull out that look very well.</p>

<p>Next we have two Dinosaurs: The T-Rex and the Pteranodon. Those dinosaurs are awesome, and far better than whatever we get nowdays. The Pteranodon is made out of 6 pieces, and the T-Rex is also made out of 6 pieces. Though some may not like them for being made out of overspecialized parts, I don&#39;t mind that. Their parts (especially the pteranodon wings) could be used in MOCs, and I have seen people use them. But putting that aside, they look awesome. They have everything I could possibly want from mutant dinosaurs.&nbsp; The T-Rex even has the light-up eyes and tongue feature, which is a great audition to an already great dinosaur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today&#39;s LEGO dinosaurs feel like babies when compared to those ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for the build: The T-1 Typhoon. It&#39;s just bt definition, fantastic. I just can&#39;t praise it enough. It HUGE! If you were to put this thing In a custom made LEGO City, this will probably take half the space. It&#39;s easily the biggest (and the best) Helicopter LEGO has ever produced.</p>

<p>Another great aspect is the color scheme, consisting primarily of Dark Red (which I also like calling Metru Red) and Tan (also known as sand), and boy, does it work. Not only those two colors work very well together, but it also gives it a very military look!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It features dual cockpits, two big machine guns, a spot for a gunner in the back, landing gear, a hook, and a spring loaded shooter in the front. So much stuff! Everything I could possibly want from a high tech military helicopter!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only concern would probably be the lack of very interesting parts, the set consisting mostly of very common ones, but that&#39;s not big of a deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it was released, the set retailed for 70$. Excuse me. 70$?!?! This low? If this set was released nowdays, it would easily go for 100$+. So the price for what you get is fantastic. I wish we still got sets that are so well priced nowadays.</p>

<p>To sum it all up, I dare to call this set perfect. It should appeal to both kids and adults, kids likening it for the cool helicopter and dinos, and the adults appreciatig it for it&#39;s military esthetic (also, despite LEGO&#39;s current policy of not producing military themed sets, this theme probably got the closest to that).</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see any real flaw with it, despite the lack of very interesting interesting parts, which would barely even be called a flaw.</p>

<p>In the end, I honesty don&#39;t see why LEGO keeps sticking to those underwhelming Jurassic World sets when they could produce something as awesome as Dino Attack. What is to like about Jurassic World that Dino Attack doesn&#39;t do so much better?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t recommend this set enough. It&#39;s pretty expensive on the after market, but I gurantee, you are not going to regret it!</p>
