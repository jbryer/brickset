"aaron","2005-06-08T23:51:46Z",":) Nice over all asethetic design, ++ green elements, :( a bit dull","Overall Value: 3 (cost+aesthetics+technical+build)/4: The aesthetic design of the car looks good when built, the chassis is rugged and would get high marks for playability, I loved the green elements, however there isn’t anything exciting from a technical or build perspective
----------
Cost: 4 : Good
$0.08 per element  ($49.99 US / 622 elements)

Aesthetics: 3 : Cool, but....
Form: + Aggressive look and compact form, - A bit empty on the inside, - uses flexible elements to define car body

Elements: (Color, Material, Texture): + Green elements are great – Gray chrome elements feel cheap and show flow lines from the injection molding process. - The “supercharger” element on the hood/bonnet is ridiculous; I hate it when Lego creates new elements that have a very limited use, this could have been built using existing elements.

Color combination: I like the green, but would have chosen something other than red to contrast it with. 

Technical: 2 : Nothing special
Engine / Drivetrain: none
Suspension: none
Steering: Hand of god linkage 
Actuations: Hood/Bonnet opens to reveal steering linkage 

Build: 2 : Yawn
Fast build, not terribly exciting, or innovative

"erik_leppen","2006-01-05T05:37:01Z","Should not be thought of as a Technic set","As is on the box, this is a Racers set. While I normally always buy Technic sets, I knew I just had to have this set. Because of the green color mainly, and it just is a nice model with nice wheels. First, I summarize the pluses of this model.

1. The green color is pretty rare, and there are quite a lot of parts in this color.
2. The chassis is studless, with which you can extend your studless parts collection rather much. It has some cool parts in cool colors. Red axles of 4 and 12, red 3 x 5 quarter-oval liftarms, even a few red bushes. No fewer than 13 beams of length 15.
3. It looks very good and is well built.
4. At first, I hated that red color, but actually it is a good choice. I have now got some useful red parts also.
5. The chairs are very nice.

The minuses.
1. The chassis is quite empty
2. Some parts were accidentally exchanged by other colors. Some of the silver pars were there in red and some of the lime-green parts I got in black.
3. Multi-part stickers are the worst thing of this set. LEGO should not do multi-part stickers. I did of course not sticker those. However the flames-stickers are cool and add a lot to the model.
4. The supercharger element is stupid, as said in the other review. It could (and should) have been made out of smaller elements, like the gas tanks are.

I think it is a very good set however, and when you like studless, or just like the color or the model, I would say just get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-03-17T22:49:00.937Z","You have to get this freakin thing","I absolutely love this set.  I'm a big fan of technic and yeah, I know it's supposedly a racer, but it's obviously made up almost exclusively of technic elements.  I like it so much I paid full price for it, and my wife almost never lets me do that.  The shape reminds me of a third-generation RX-7, but that might just be my mind playing tricks on me, as I love RX-7s.  While it leaves a lot to be desired on the technical side, you get what you pay for.  A $50 set obviously isn't going to have a transmission, moving engine, or shocks.  

The good:

Lots of cool lime green elements, including 4 fairing panels in that color, plus some nice red elements including 2 12L axles.
13 1x15 liftarms
Lots of room for improvement
As stated before, pseudo-orgasmically cool syling.

The bad:

That supercharger piece of crap has got to go--I hope lego retires this brick for good.  That's the only attempt at an engine made in this set, so the whole hood is virtually empty, leaving room for personalization.  The steering is hand-of-god only, but again, plenty of room to fix that.  The entire back end is completely empty except for the two nitrous bottles.  This does leave room for a rear-mounted engine, though.

The ugly:

Nuthin...haven't you been paying attention?


The conclusion:  Do whatever it takes--sell blood, rob a liquor store, sell your wife to a stereotypical 80's Arab oil tycoon, but you must own this set!
