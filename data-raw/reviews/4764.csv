"Carl","2009-10-31T01:25:09.403Z","Could it ever be better?","Well, the answer to my title question is yes. The 2009 Glatorian are better than this guy, especially Strakk, Skrall, Vorox, Malum, Gresh... well, all of them! Except Mata Nui. Anyway, onto the set.

I got Iruini and Norik in a value pack which came with both of them. Toa Hagah Iruini has a great build and I think is better than Norik. Now onto a piece by piece review.

Colour Scheme:

The colour scheme of Iruini is awesome. Lego really made green and gold go well together. In my opinion I think they chose just the right parts for each colour.
Colour Scheme: 5/5

Mask:

I'll tell you now: The mask is AWESOME! Unlike Norik, who stole Turaga Dume's mask and gave it a scruffy paint job, Iruini's mask is completely new. Great job Lego!
Mask: 5/5

Legs:

The legs are simple but do the job well. They have the tall limbs from Visorak Keelerahk. The Toa Metru feet look cool in gold as do the Toa Metru leg limb armour pieces.
Legs: 5/5

Arms:

The arms, like the legs, are simple but effective. They are attached to the torso like the Toa Metru's arms and have the sam armour pieces except in gold. The Suukorahk limbs are now in dark green and are used as Iruini's arm limbs.
Arms: 5/5

Weapon and Shield:

The Cyclone spear is cool, like the rest of Iruini and the shield is great. Both are good for posability and the Rhotuka spinner on the shield fires SUPER GOOD! Unlike the Hordika, Iruini's Rhotuka are green and gold, one of each. The Cyclone spear uses a Kikanalo mouth as its head but the piece is gold and looks great in that colour.
Weapon and Shiled: 5/5

Torso:

The Torso of Toa Hagah Iruini is the same as the Toa Metru's, and looks really good. He has the same arm swiveling mechanism which has sadly been thrown in the bin over recent years and when I swivel his arms I reminisce of how the old Bionicles were so cleverly created. But I'm not saying that the Glatorian are rubbish. The torso is around the same as Matau's and is the same colour too.
Torso: 5/5

Overall:

Overall Toa Iruini is awesome and is a must buy for all Bionicle fans around the globe. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-09T10:35:05.033Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Toa Hagah) - Toa Iruini Review","This is another valuable BIONICLE set which LEGO did and it's a fun set to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. This figure has a the same launcher which is able to shoot spinners as Norik. On the other hand we also get a staff. Another cool piece is the mask we get for Iruini. These Toa Hagah are really cool but I'm really disappointed that LEGO 
never made a toa version of Gaaki, Bomonga, Pouks and Kualus. This is a 
cool set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's 
(My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"james3426","2009-10-30T17:44:22.263Z","The Elite Toa of Air","I got him from a friend who had him broken up and mixed in his lego boxes. I found most his important pieces , which are the Bionicle pieces, not the technic pieces (I could not find the gold Rhotuka).  The head of the Cyclone spear was ""battle damaged"", but it was okay. I really like all the gold pieces, especially the Gahlok-Kal magnetism shield. The rhotuka launching shield is cool and fires far, but the rhotuka in the position were it launches falls out easily. The Kanohi Kualsi, mask of quick-travel, looks like a smaller version of a Vahki head.

pros:
Gold pieces.
Cyclone Spear.
Rhotuka launching Shield.
Semi-custom Toa Metru design.
Kanohi Kualsi.

cons:
Rhotuka falls out.

He is hard to find today, but do not let that get your hopes down. Try to get him if you find him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vexorian","2009-12-23T23:14:26.25Z","! Gold","I was excited when I saw this set buried under a stack of other toys in a local store and then browsed brickset to recognize it for year information and reviews and it turned out it was quite a special set, so I rushed and bought Iruini and Norik.

Most noticeable after you see the contents of the canister is that the golden pieces are not golden. The only gold bionicle stuff I had was the 'golden' Kanohi which were actually copper-ish. But from pics I actually thought this wasn't the case....

Well, it still looks very nice even though it was not really a golden toa. Anyway, unlike most reviews I actually like Norik best.

Pros:
Many parts are rare or in a non-usual color or unique.
Golden bohrok weapon!
Looks nice.
Golden Shield!

Cons:
Launchers are annoying. This one is specially bad, the disks fall off and it is hard to aim.

I think it is great for any bionicle collector out there even though the parts are not gold.

"StarWarsLegoFan123","2010-07-05T14:31:52.65Z","Best Toa Ever","When I saw this set for sale in a bookstore when I was about seven, I gaped in awe. But the price tag wasn't even close to forgiving to my parents. At that time I didn't have an allowance, so I always asked my mom or dad if ""you can please, please get this for me?"" The results were usually negative, and there were no anomalies in this experiment. But I did eventually get it two or three months later as a gift. I hardly remembered it, but I still knew what it was. It was Toa Iruni! Pros and Cons:<br><br>Pros:<br>1)The swinging arm is a great feature for battles. I always paired Toa Iruni and my Rahkshi Panrahk against each other, since Panrahk and all Rahkshi had the swinging double headed spear.<br>2)The other feature, a disc launcher, is good but if you let the arm hang straight, the disc always falls out. That is the only nuisance about this Bionicle, other than him falling down five seconds after you've posed him.<br>3)The gold armor is great, and it compliments the dark green perfectly. <br><br>Cons:<br>1)Unstable, sometimes hard to pose. <br>2)Disc always falls out from launcher.<br><br>Other than those two cons, this is a great set and I would recommend it to anyone who is into Bionicle.<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"blaksamu12","2010-11-10T19:57:18.683Z","Awesome!","<p>This is an awesome Bionicle!&nbsp; Got him off ebay for $1!&nbsp;&nbsp;Toa Iruini is&nbsp;one of my favorites, and is super rare.&nbsp; He does have some downsides though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong>&nbsp; Like any other normal sized Bionicle.&nbsp; He has a Toa Metru build, and pretty basic.&nbsp; I built him in about ten minutes with no instructions (the auction I won didn't come with directions).&nbsp; Good building Experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp; </strong>The parts are new to me.&nbsp; I never had any Toa Metru Nui&nbsp;Bionicles, so the parts are pretty fancy to me.&nbsp; However, all the parts work well, but the disk launcher is kinda small, but I'll get into&nbsp;that more in the playability section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Value for Money:&nbsp; </strong>The Value for Money, especially for the deal I got, is great.&nbsp; Compared to regular legos, he is a bit expensive, but for Bionicles he is a great price.&nbsp; His sheer awesomeness makes Toa Iruini totally worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability</strong>:&nbsp; Here's where the downsides are.&nbsp; For me, his legs move a lot (probably because I got him used), but htats only a minor problem.&nbsp; The main con is his launcher.&nbsp; I doesn't stay in the air, but hovers&nbsp;on the ground pretty far so thats&nbsp;good.&nbsp; But The&nbsp;disk never stays on its ""launching pad"".&nbsp; So if you want&nbsp;it to not fall off, you have the tilt the shield upwards.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am more of a collector and like to position them more than play with them, so I the problems aren't as big for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp; </strong>Super cool.&nbsp; Highly recommend you have him if you are a Bionicle fan.&nbsp; You can sometimes get a good deal on ebay, but he is rare, he's is kinda hard to get.&nbsp; Anyway, Toa Iruini is beastly, and oober awesome!&nbsp; </p>
