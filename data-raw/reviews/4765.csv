"lostcarpark","2007-04-12T20:40:57.07Z","Stunning","This is a fantastic set, only slightly marred by the fact that the 8x8 plates with grills have been substituted for plain 8x8 plates (I've complained to Lego about that one). I think all the minifigs are fantastic (yes, even Leia in the gold bikini). It's great to have Lando at last. However, the sail barge does seem rather sparsely populated. I think a couple of extra minor bounty hunter/scum of Tatooine minifigs would have made a big difference here. As others have pointed out, it would have been nice to have Chewie on the skiff (and maybe C3PO on the barge) - I don't think either have been in a set for a while. The Sarlac is a bit lame, but just begging to be beefed up with a pile of extra tan. The main focus of the set, the sail barge and desert skiff, are both fantastic, with lots of cool details.

Luke and Han are great, and Lando is also cool, especially with the mask.  I got a kick out of the R-2 D-2 with serving tray.  Try find that in another set!  Other minifigures include Leia, Boba Fett, Jabba, and a Gammorrean Gaurd.  These aren't that rare, but always nice to have.  The Barge is very nice and has many features.  The sides fold down and the inside is very detailed.  I specifically like the extra blasters they give you to store inside the Sail Barge.  The top features a rotating turret, a catapault thing, and what appears to be a trap door.  The sails do get in the way of the catapault, but they have to be there.  If anything Lego should have taken away the catapault, but definately not the sails.  My favorite part of this set is the Desert Skiff and Zarlacc.  The old Desert Skiff was kind of cheesy and I think this was a great upgrade.  This one has a plank and a stand.  Plus, I really like Zarlacc.  He completes the set.

Anyways, besides the sail barge, this set comes with a desert skiff and the Pit of Carcoon. As for the barge, Jabba's  huge mass takes up too much room, and the set should have included some of Jabba's alien lackeys. What it is does have, is a jail, a gun rack, and a kitchen for the ever growing Jabba (as if he wasn't fat enough already).

"Jim_Java","2008-09-13T09:05:11.607Z","&quot;Last chance, Jabba!&quot;","     This is easily one of the best sets of 2006.  It's set in Episode VI (6, for those who don't know Roman numerals!), during the first part of the movie. It's big... It's got enough cool little features to rival a Harry Potter set... IT'S JABBA'S SAIL BARGE! 
     It's a pretty big set, and it does have some building challenges other than its size. One of them is the issue of putting the flaps on. These flaps are to be attached to a long bendy stick, and it's hard to get them to fit. In the end, though, I managed this without much difficulty. There's also a problem with attaching the main deck-It's held on the barge by two long light-grey pieces and you may find hard to connect the deck to them. 
     However, there are no complex gears, and when you're done, you've got a great set. It's really movie-accurate, replicating the long light-grey section that sticks out at the rear, and the SAILS. Honestly, those things look neat!  You can rotate them around to see the cannon and Artoo better. There's a flaw in there design, however-they're attached to the deck by long rods that can sink to far into the deck. I suspect you can fix this by attaching a simple flat, square piece to the underside of the deck, although I have not found it necessary to.
     There are a LOAD of neat features. Jabba's got plenty of food, such as two (plastic) pork legs you can hang near him (a nice touch), and the cannon, which looks wickedly awesome and deadly cool.  And there aree four guns, (Two of the loudspeaker variety, and two of the big ones with scopes) for Boba Fett, who also has a catapult for leaping off the barge, for whatever reasons.
     Then there are the minifigures... This set comes with Jabba, of course, and Leia, in her dancer's outfit. There's also Han Solo, Luke, with a lightsaber, the Gamorrean Guard, and Lando Calrissian, who along with the Guard, has a neat rock-textured ax.  And finally, there's R2-D2, with a serving tray, and Boba Fett.  I do have a question- Why is Salacious Crumb, (Jabba's pet alien monkey) absent from the set, along with, for that matter, a Twilek dancer, Chewbacca, or C-3PO?  I guess you can't have all the minifigs, but I would at least liked to have seen Salacious.
     Then there's the speeder, also movie-accurate, with a flip-out gangplank, and THE EVIL SARLACC! Seriously, though, that thing is neat! There's just one problem-even with the clear blocks that hold up the speeder,  you'll still need to use a couple thick books to lift the speeder high enough that people can fall into the Sarlacc's mouth. 
     So in conclusion? If you want a good &quot;display&quot; set that's also fun to play with, well here it is!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"starwarsgeek101_","2009-06-27T20:20:07.717Z","What a bargain!","Let's just start off as if this set were out today, it would be alot more expensive. Considering that this set was the only one to contain Lando in skiff disguise, Leia in flesh color as a slave, and Han Solo in flesh as prisoner to Jabba the hutt.

There are some flaws however. First, why isn't Chewie in this set? He was going to be thrown into the sarlaac just like Luke and Han. Next, the sides of the Sail barge will not stay on. Lastly, that small catapult that LEGO made will definetly not throw Luke's lightsaber to him.

Now that we have the flaws set aside, I want to talk about the inside of the ship. It is pretty amazing what LEGO can do when they put their minds into a set! the prison cages that contain Han and Luke (and also Chewie), can open and close. There is also jabba's dinner waiting for him inside the sail barge, frog and snake!!

I was really impressed with all the details and features it had. I was able to get it for $45 without Luke, R2, Jabba, or Han, but thats okay. The skiff is incredible seeing as the origanal skiff just seemed to be thrown together. The Sarlacc pit is cool, but I think it should have been deeper and had an tentecle or two. The sails are a little low, but managable. The overall size of the top is large, but should have come with more detail.

Good selection of minifigures

"PaulTR","2011-06-03T17:45:29.913Z","Jabba Would Be Proud!","<p>The 6210 was one of&nbsp;the first big SW sets that I purchased. I ordered it directly from LEGO&nbsp;and as soon as it arrived at my doorstep, I was rushing into my basement to build it. After I was done, all I could say was ""wow!"" Without a doubt, this is one of the best SW sets ever made!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is a&nbsp;gorgeous looking model when compared to the&nbsp;canon version. The slope of the&nbsp;nose, the sails, the rear exhaust, everything is put down as close to original, whilst still fitting minifigs. I'm especially pleased with the little sand skiff, as it looks suitably accurate and&nbsp;can fit several figs. The Saarlac is also a great addition, although I think some tentacles would have been nice to have. The figs are simply outstanding looking, with&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them being exclusives or extremly rare;&nbsp;indeed, I would consider all the figs to be very&nbsp;rare, minus&nbsp;R2.&nbsp;The interior of the set is very well-done, with a small kitchen, jail cell, and relaxation room.&nbsp;The details are very cool, such as a small transluscent stove and a hookah for Jabba.&nbsp;However, I must say, I'm a bit sad the designers did not take full&nbsp;advantage of all the room inside the Sail Barge (which I will discuss later). But overall, I am very&nbsp;impressed with the Barge's appearence!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build for this set was fun, and I enjoyed&nbsp;it very much. The&nbsp;Barge is primarily&nbsp;a platform (with friction-less plates on the bottom) attached to the upper deck by spaced archways; overturned&nbsp;hull pieces are cleverly attached to each other and clicked into the main body to form the front.&nbsp;The entire set is then covered in moveable panels on the sides, which, for the most part, can be opened to reveal the interior. A simple&nbsp;latticed-deck, wich has some&nbsp;easy lift-off functionality, covers the top, along with the sails. Overall, I was very happy with the build; however, the side&nbsp;windows were a bit&nbsp;tricky to make.&nbsp;There is&nbsp;exactly enough room for the panels on the&nbsp;black support&nbsp;tube; any&nbsp;misplaced panel will leave the rest&nbsp;barely attached, which is very annoying. I'm also&nbsp;sad the designers squandered the room inside the&nbsp;Barge:&nbsp;the jail cell is a bit too big for my liking, the entire&nbsp;nose of the Barge is empty, and&nbsp;the space from the&nbsp;steering vanes&nbsp;back is void.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;this does leave a lot of room for&nbsp;modding, so at least the designers didn't include too little room.&nbsp;The skiff is ingeniously designed, with the gang-plank attached to a hinge point and the steering vanes well-positioned. The Sarlaac is also very cool, utilizing rare dark-sand-colored pieces for the ""beak""; however, like I previously said, I&nbsp;think it would've been nice if there were some&nbsp;tentacles. Also, the Sail Barge's sails are a bit fragile.&nbsp;But all of my complaints for the build are thrown to the wind when the&nbsp;pieces themselves&nbsp;are scrutinized: You get&nbsp;heaps of brown and sand pieces, plenty of black tubing, two unique sails,&nbsp;blasters,&nbsp;a green&nbsp;translucent&nbsp;stove, chicken legs, a frog, black&nbsp;bars, the list goes on! And the figs! Wow! You get an exclusive Lando (with unique body and&nbsp;helmet), a rare Leia&nbsp;Slave Girl outfit (or is it ""non-fit""? ;) a cool Gamorean,&nbsp;an incredibly rare Jabba fig, Boba Fett, Luke, R2-D2, and a decently rare Han. The figs for this set are simply amazing;&nbsp;the only thing I wish the designers included&nbsp;was maybe a&nbsp;Rodian, another Gamorean, or a Chewie fig, as there doesn't seem to be enough guards. Still,&nbsp;I can live&nbsp;with it. As for price, the set is&nbsp;extremly well-priced&nbsp;at $75&nbsp;US dollars for 781 pieces; it just doesn't get better than that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set sports tons of play features. You can open the&nbsp;Barge,&nbsp;open the windows, launch Boba from his little launcher, adjust the sails, man the gun, extend the plank, twirl the Sarlaac's beak, lock up the prisoners,&nbsp;and&nbsp;much more.&nbsp;You can&nbsp;re-create&nbsp;just about everything that happened in the movie; however, it is a little sad a second skiff was not included. Nonetheless,&nbsp;this set is still&nbsp;chock&nbsp;full of features;&nbsp;I would consider it&nbsp;one of the most feature-friendly&nbsp;SW sets to date! To top it all off, 3 pictures of&nbsp;alternative models are depicted in the instructions, including a ship, Jabba's palace, and even a&nbsp;giant fish; instructions for them are not provided, but the pictures do a good job of showcasing what the&nbsp;set can be&nbsp;alternatively used&nbsp;for.&nbsp;The only complaint I have against the set's playability is that&nbsp;you can't really use the set for any other Star Wars&nbsp;scene;&nbsp;but hey!&nbsp;that's not really the set's fault :) Whew!&nbsp;That was long! Now let's tally everything up!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Very accurate looking 
<li>-Unique and interesting build 
<li>-Plenty of&nbsp;rare figs 
<li>-Detailed interior 
<li>-Tons of play features 
<li>-Alternative models&nbsp;shown for inspiration 
<li>-Well-priced 
<li>-Sturdy (minus sails)</li></ul>

<li>-Some stickers 
<li>-A tad bit too empty 
<li>-Sarlaac could use&nbsp;some tentacles

<p>The verdict?&nbsp;Get...this...Sail Barge!&nbsp;This is such a unique and fabulous set, I would highly&nbsp;recommend it&nbsp;to&nbsp;any SW fan. Indeed, even if you don't plan on playing with it, the set&nbsp;looks stupendous as a model, and the figs are definitely collectors items!&nbsp;In conclusion, all I have to say&nbsp;is, Jabba himself&nbsp;would be proud of so fine a set :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

I will say this set was worth every penny (and the sideways glances from my wife for spending so much on a used set LOL).<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Does it take you back to the movies? YES! This set is so well done you feel like you're standing next to Han and Chewie waiting for the skiff guard to push Luke into the Sarlacc pit. The details are spot on from the sail barge's sails to the deck gun, from the skiff's side vanes to the plank. This is a very well designed set from the standpoint of movie lore. Nice work LEGO.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The build was a lot of fun. Others have mentioned it was tricky, and there are a couple of spots that you have to be careful, like putting the nose section on or the side walls. But I didn't find it overly difficult. The whole build was great; after you knock out the sail barge you have the skiff and then the Sarlacc, its like two desserts after your delicious meal.</li><li>Pro 3: This set has some great pieces. Lots of sand-tan and dark brown. Unusual colors for LEGO, but this set has a lot of them. The Sarlacc's mouth is also a sandy color I've not seen before.</li><li>Pro 4: Playability - its fantastic. The sides of the barge fold down to access the interior. There is a deck gun, and a catapult to launch Boba Fett over to the skiff. The skiff's gangplank rotates out, the Sarlacc's mouth opens and closes, and Jabba has a hooka and a kitchen with all sorts of treats for a Hutt inside.</li><li>Pro 5: The minifigures included are great. Lando, Luke, Han, Leia and the Gammorean guard are unique to this set. Great addition to your collection. This set is one of two that has this version of Jabba. Jabba and the Gammorean guard are cool, but their lack of color leaves one wanting to see the new versions. And princess Leia in her slave girl outfit, another must-have figure. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The first con is a big one, the stickers. This set is FULL of them. There are lots of stickers. But the worst part is that LEGO has you putting stickers over multiple pieces. Thankfully the seller put them on very carefully and I didn't have any torn ones when I bought the set. But keep an eye out for damaged stickers when buying the set.<br></li><li>Con 2: Like other reviewers mentioned it would have been cool to have a couple more palace guards in the set. But you get so many cool minifigures its hard to complain.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is not a cheap set, especially when you consider most are used (new ones are REALLY pricey). If you keep your eyes open you can find good examples that are taken care of, and that aren't too pricey. This is a fantastic set, and like I said, worth every penny I spent on it. It looks awesome next to my other Tatooine sets, and I can't wait to get the new Jabba's Palace, Rancor Pit, and Skiff. I recommend this set to collectors and pretty much any Star Wars fan out there. Nicely done, LEGO.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"Malurus","2012-08-11T13:33:39.913Z","""A Hutt without a sail barge is like a smoke moth without wings""","<p>I waited a long time for this set and was overjoyed when&nbsp;I got it on a christmas day! It was quite a nice build and most&nbsp;of the characters&nbsp;are exclusive minifigures.&nbsp;The model can hold itself up but if damged from the exterior it shall colapse. The catapult to launch Boba was a neat touch. The cannon for Princess Leia was cool. But&nbsp;I like the Gorg oven (Gorgs are represented with frog pieces). The skiff had nice detail and I liked how you could push the platform in and out. The Sarlaac was ok, shoud have had a few of it's tentacles showing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I really liked the set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"cderickson","2013-02-01T14:05:15.77Z","Boba Fett, where?!?","<p>The sail barge and the palace are the two main places we see Jabba in the original trilogy and this set was definitly better than the original palace.. I think overall they did a fairly decent job on this set. The scale was a ""little"" off but if it had been to scale it would have been like 4 feet long and 1 foot wide.</p>
<p>Characters: Pretty good group of characters. nothing much else to say.</p>
<p>Ship: As I mentioned before the set could have been scaled a little larger but it works. It's not a difficult set to put together, but it had too many stickers. If you put it together and leave it on a shelf its fine, but if it gets taken apart and thrown into a bin with other legos they will get messed up because alot of the stickers cover 2 pieces. The side panels can be a little difficult to get perfect but not terrible.</p>
<p>Skiff: This was a definite improvement on the original skiff that included Han &amp; Luke. It is much more detailed and looks better (The 2012 version is even more improved) I think the scale on the skiff was nearly perfect for the character size.</p>
<p>Sarlacc Pit: The pit is fairly easy to build. As others have mentioned there are no tenticles and it can't hold a character inside (Which the new one can). But still looks cool.</p>
<p>Overall it is a pretty cool set to have in any collection and has quite a few areas to explore on the set and is a blast to build and play with. Little pricy but considering you get the skiff and pit which could have easily been its own set at around $20-$25 its not a bad deal.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
