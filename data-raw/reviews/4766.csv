Pros:

-AWESOME minifugures (9, including new ones like Grand Moff Tarkin,  the astromech, and mouse droid!!!)

-Extremely realistic!!

-AWESOME removable bridge.

-AWESOME hinge that lets you see inside the bridge.

-AWESOME price-to-parts ratio.

-AWESOME easily removed panels that allow you to look inside and play inside it.

-AWESOME build time (took me 3 hours, and I'm not the slowest builder).

-AWESOME overall design.

-Makes an AWESOME centerpiece.

-Very cool escape pod that you can launch out of the hangar (but sometimes it gets stuck, you have to push hard and quickly).

Cons:

-Fragile, but take a couple of wing pieces and attach them to the bottom and the problem is mostly solved.

-The Darth-Vader-mechanical-helmet-taker-offer can't hold his helmet at all.

Also, I was disappointed that the Stormtroopers had the old megaphone guns instead of the new rifles issued with other sets - I've since upgraded all the small arms on board to the new Imperial standard.

Also - my Imperial guards have black hands, yet the box shows them with red hands and all other guards from other sets have red hands - it makes them look a little odd when they are all on parade together.

"Lumix","2008-04-07T17:58:27.687Z","THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE","Let me tell you this is a GREAT SET, one of the best STAR WARS sets ever!

The final model is BIG, one of the biggest non-UCS Lego Sets, and it’s impressive. Yeah, OK, it’s not #10030 size, but it’s HUGE anyway! It’s amazing how well the Lego Team have designed the engines, the distinctive triangular shape of the ship, the brigde, lasers and some details in the hull, and at the same time a model that you can actually open, play with and has a lot of details inside!

Some say it’s not on scale... how on earth is it supposed to be on scale? In order for the #6211 to be in scale with minifigs, it should measure about 11 m! Haha! But the ship itself is pretty accurate! Again, it’s not UCS, but has a lot of details and doesn’t dissapoint at all. Once built, it feels like a powerful ship, centerpiece and model to show.

Photos don’t make justice to this model, which, once built, is much bigger than it appears in the box (or photos).

The mini-figures are awesome. I love the red guards, and Darth Vader has his “ill face” under his helmet. R2-D5 is cool and even the mouse droid is accurate!

I specially want to point out that, unlike other reviewers have said, the model is NOT filmsy. I guess if a 10-year old child plays with it, it can get a bit dismantled, but if you build it properly, it is not filmsy. I haven even got 4 extra triangular plates in this  model which I used to reinforce the bottom and the wings. I can even swoosh it around! And that’s without modding it! Imagine what you can do if you reinforce it a little bit (which is pretty easy, btw).

As for playability, there are many things you can do: rotate the four laser cannons, fire another two of them, open the command bridge, remove it entirely to access the interior area, open the wings, launch the escape pod, use Vader’s helmet, open and close Vader’s meditation chamber, use Vader’s meeting with the Emperor (cool hologram included), use the weapons rack, and of course play with the many minifigs it includes. 

The building is pretty straightforward. There are 12 numbered bags with pieces, some of which contains small bags with small pieces. Overall, it’s easy to build. You start with the bottom, then the inner technic structure, the wings and finally the bridge. It comes with two instruction booklets. I had a great time building this set and watching it taking the (in)famous, allmighty and feared shape of the Star Destroyer. When I show it to people, it’s like OHHH, and when I open it and show the inners, they are totally amazed!

I bought it in Madrid, Spain. I paid 115 EUR for it, not too expensive considering that it costs 149 EUR in legoshop, for example.

I missed the UCS Star Destroyer #10030 back in 2002, so I was very interested in this one, and I have not been deceived at all. #6211 is a great model on its own, and you can have lots of fun with it..

I have also bought the UCS Millennium Falcon #10179, but I have not built it yet; I’m willing to do it and exhibit those two great sets together.

One thing that almost hasn’t been mentioned before is that you can build another TWO models with this set. Given that almost no set has an alternative model, this is a big plus, because you can build not only one more ship, but TWO! Yep, that’s great. You can build the YT-2600 Outrider, which just feels right, and the T-16 SkyHopper, which is GREAT! Hey, they aren’t top-notch models, but they are more than OK. Besides, you get more building time and more fun for the same price. This is a BIG BONUS with this set.

I strongly recommend it to other people!

Pros:
-	Huge.
-	Pretty well designed.
-	Impressive set once built, begs to be shown.
-	Details outside, and LOTS of details inside.
-	8 great minifigs included.
-	Bridge mechanism and open-wings work very well.
-	You can play with it a lot.
-	You can build another interesting two models following instructions on the web.
-	It’s NOT filmsy, I can even swoosh it around!

Cons:
-	Vader’s helmet thing doesn’t work well... not too badly, but not well.
-	Some pieces (like the technic beams) should have been grey, not white, but I’m    nitpicking here. It’s easy to mod and make it more like the real thing.

Room two isn't much, escape pod for two, 'boarding hatch(the one Tantive IV was in)', and storage for Darth Vader's lightsaber.

The ISD is full of little touches that enhance its reputation as one of the most playable sets made, sliding gun rack, light sabar holder, darth vadars little area and helmet carrier ~(and yes this nevers works).

The eascape pod actually fits people inside (its not hinged though) i haven't applied the stickers yet so not sure if this stops it opening btw. Other reviews have mentioned the structural fraileties (i need a spell check) but i have figured out a fix that requires no extra pieces.

I must begin this review with the assertion that LEGO has to make more capital ship sets. <br>Now that the effusive praise is done with, let's begin with this.<br><p>The Kuat Drive Yards Imperial-II Class Star Destroyer is huge, a whopping 1600 meters in Star Wars canon, and so is the model. <br></p><p>Just kidding.</p>But it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">is</span> huge! This thing needs two instruction manuals for completion, a true testament to how big the finished ship is. The model features several interior spaces: a hangar, crew quarters and a bridge, not to mention a nice escape pod. These spaces are rendered in style, with minifigs punctuating the scene. Darth Vader's hyperbaric chamber also comes with, as does Grand Moff Tarkin (get this set if you want a Grand Moff- the Death Star is WAY too expensive!) and R2-Q5 (again, the same thing!). There are some stormtroopers too, as well as some Imperial Guards, an Officer and a Mouse Droid (get <span style=""font-style: italic;"">this</span> set, not the Death Star!) Wall-mounted consoles and ribbed partitions add to the realism. The ship was great fun to build, and took me a day or two, which is long for me. The exterior of the ship is also cool, with turbolasers and missile tubes added for overall effect.<br><p>As would be expected with a model of this size and milieu, however, there are some drawbacks. For one, the stickers. Yeesh. This - 2006 - was around the time transfers began to disappear from the LEGO niche and be replaced with stickers. They were hard to place and took too much time off the build. I know some like to remove stickers to use bricks in MOCs, but there are specialized markets for that. The laser cannons also fire with the force - get it? - of a sedated butterfly. Not exactly Taim and Bak standards. Also, 90 Sterling?! I got this thing from Hamleys in London, so it was mega expensive.<br></p><p>You may dispense with the Pros and Cons, Commander. I've told you all you need to know.

I found a lot of people worrying and stressing because they couldn't lift the set up without it breaking, I'm writing this review to tell you how to pick the set up without it breaking, I'm telling you this now encase you wanted an actual review so you can skip this review if you not interested. <br>The bottom of the set is very fragile. You basically cannot lift this set up from the bottom because it only consists of a very thin floor construction. By lifting this set up you will push the floor up and the set will come crashing down on you hands, and possibly fall onto the ground and create more destruction. To lift this set up/ or fly the set around with care you need to:<br>1.) Carefully slide your <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Right </span>hand at the very back of the set. Your Right hand should then be directly under the Technic wall formation at the back near the Engines. This end of the ship is the strongest part of the ship to place your hand because it guarantees that the floor or set won't break. <br>2.) Carefully slide your <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Left</span> hand at the end of the ship where the floor ends. This part of the ship balances the weight when you hand is placed because it is also a strong and secure structure that won't create Havoc or break the set.<br><br>I hope that was helpful, and hopefully you can lift the set up without it breaking, <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Techman","2011-11-28T15:38:27.193Z","An absolute must set to own!","This set was first released in 2006. The moment I saw this set I had to have it. This is a classic model for any Star Wars fanatic. This set includes a ton of pieces, nearly 1366 and great figures to come with it. One of my favorites is the rare Grand Moff Tarkin. Of course Darth Vader comes with it and some storm troopers and others as well. There is a cool droid that I think is rare too. The set itself is very long and I like how the frame was a triangle shape to form the basic shape of the ship. It was cool to see how the ship was being built. The bags were, I think, numbered in this set. That did help since there was a lot of pieces. One thing I didn't like was the bottom base part which breaks quite easily if not picked up with care. I usually pick it up with both hands on the bottom underside side panels where it is more securely attached. The command bridge is wicked cool. I liked how the back part can come down to reveal the cockpit area which can hold two figures. Inside the massive Star Destroyer there is an escape pod which can be shot out through an exit hole at the bottom of the ship. That never really worked to well in my case, but still looks great to hold figures inside it. There is basically a lot of features to this set and the designer put great quality features to make this set awesome. It even look like the real ship which is nice. It is fragile somewhat on the panels that open to reveal the inside, but that doesn't takeaway from the greatness of the set at all. The set has great play ability with what is included: concealed gun racks, opening command bridge, escape pod, Darth Vader's meditation seat, a cool hologram of the emperor, and much much more. The set in my opinion is definitely worth the money. When it first came out, the set costed around $100. That's a good deal for the 1300 pieces you get too. To conclude, this set is an absolute beast. It is my favorite set that I own and my largest too. It has great figures and you will have hours playing with all the features it offers.

"HikerCZ","2013-03-30T12:45:04.16Z","Truly Imperial ","As a Lego SW late-bloomer, there was no chance of me getting this set brand new. I was quite hesitant about buying a slightly overpriced set on the secondary market but the need in me had simply taken over. I managed to get a used set in a pristine condition, so the whole experience was comparable to building a new one - even the stickers haven't been applied yet (not sure if it's a blessing or a curse, see below). <br><br>The build is not for complete beginners and can take some time, especially some of the technics solutions require precision and patience (and trained fingers). But I like to cherish the time spent building, so I didn't rush through it. Once finished, the set looks stunning and although it's not as big as we would like it to be (about 60 cm/2 ft), still is a good representation of the 'real' thing. The various shades of grey fit perfectly in the SW universe. The bottom section seems somewhat poorer, almost unfinished, however, it's very unlikely that you're going to be swooshing around with this model, so no one really notices this flaw. Some builders have complained about the set being too brittle - let me tell you, if it's built properly, nothing falls apart or breaks. Obviously you must lift the ship with both hands holding the sides and the bottom but considering the size and the weight of the model, that only seems obvious. <br><br>The inside of the ship offers great playability, including Darth Vader's chamber, a number of work stations, Emperor's hologram, the escape pod, the command deck, etc. The minifigures are great and plentiful. You get eight minifigs (some of which are exclusive to this set) and the Mouse Droid (not really a minifig), all that is fun. <br><br>As far as the drawbacks go, I have to mention the escape pod which doesn't look that great and I haven't even dared to apply the huge sticker on it - I hate when stickers get misaligned. So it's a big white box in my case. Luckily the rest of stickers are applied on panels, which is manageable. Also getting inside the ship might be a nuisance for some and requires some getting used to. <br><br>All in all, this was definitely one of better Lego models in that price category. I'm quite positive that a rebooted version would have to cost at least 150 dollars now but somehow I'm sceptical that Lego's going to reboot this model. While the UCS model is out of reach now, this one is still available on secondary markets even in mint condition (but for a hefty price). If you consider expanding your Empire fleet, it's a must. If you get a used one from a private collector, you can even stomach the price. I personally love the ship, it looks fantastic, nevertheless, after I bought the 2011 Millennium Falcon, I wish it were twice its size since the two models are almost the same size. And that doesn't seem right. So maybe a nice 100-120 cm/3-4 ft long UCS model for a reboot? <br><br><br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

It's a phenomenal set with so much in store.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>This box is HUGE. It shows the monster flinging an escape pod into space, while shooting at Rebel scum around it. Inside the box, you find two big manuals, and twelve numbered bags. The instructions were fun to look at during the entertaining build of the set. Here's how it breaks down:</div><div>-Bag One contains the minifigures and weapons.</div><div>-Bag Two contains the floor of the ship and Vader's meditation chamber.</div><div>-Bag Three contains the skeleton of the monster.</div><div>-Bag Four contains extra detailing. (hangar details, meditation chamber helmet mover, Palpatine hologram)</div><div>-Bag Five contains the engines and escape pod.</div><div>-Bag Six contains the bottom panels of the ship and the front panels of the ship.</div><div>-Bag Seven contains the main panels that exposes the main ship.</div><div>-Bag Eight contains the main part of the command tower.</div><div>-Bag Nine contains the deflector shield domes.</div><div>-Bag Ten contains the port-side rear panels of the command tower.</div><div>-Bag Eleven contains the starboard-side rear panels.</div><div>-Bag Twelve contains both front panels of the command tower.</div><div>The instructions are split into two manuals. Book one builds bags one through part of six, and book two constructs the rest of six through twelve. It was a fun build.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Stickers:</b></div><div>There are thirteen stickers, which is a small number for such a massive ship. But I like applying stickers, unlike many others, so it was an enjoyment to me, even though only one of them is really exposed.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>There are mostly gray wing pieces that are included here, along with a few neon green lightsaber blades for the green lasers, which is actually kind of clever. All in all, there is a very good parts selection here, and there is a fail mix of technic and system.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>There are nine minifigures here, so from here on out, I will do this part a bit differently. The minifigures also are the only contents of bag one. So without further ado, let's get going!</div><div><u>Bag One:</u></div><div>Darth Vader - This is the first undamaged Darth Vader minifigure I've ever gotten. At the time, he was a great minifigure (until of course I got the latest versions, but that's not important now). His helmet is very cool, and the detailing was pretty good at the time. He has the amazing chrome lightsaber, although the silver ones aren't that horrible.</div><div>Stormtroopers - I've always loved collecting stormtroopers. They may be weak-minded, but they sure do look cool. I got the star destroyer with the new-style helmets, and I really like those. The one thing I dislike about the stormtroopers were the blank flesh heads. Even though they had black heads eventually, they got faces in 2012, which you can't get much better than that.</div><div>Imperial Royal Guards - These are probably the coolest minifigures of the set. I love their red garments and the fact that they carry spears. Even though in the instructions they have black hands, mine came with red. It doesn't matter to me, they still look great, and I always welcome red capes.</div><div>Imperial Officer - These are always great minifigures too, although I wish more of them were included here. You can't go wrong with Imperial officers.</div><div>Grand Moff Tarkin - Another great figure. His face is great, he really looks angry and sinister, like he's gonna use the star destroyer to blow up a planet.</div><div>R2-Q5 - I know the box says R2-D5, but it's actually Q5. Unfortunately, my star destroyer didn't include the fully-detailed head like the new R2-D2. Never a bad thing to include a black astromech droid, though.</div><div>Mouse Droid - These are cute little things. Unfortunately, I only own one, but I can always make more out of the many parts in my basement.</div><div>Overall, a great selection of Imperial reinforcements.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Star Destroyer:</b></div><div><u>Bag Two:</u></div><div>This is where construction of the actual ship begins, and this constructs the floor. It also constructs Darth Vader's meditation chamber, a reference to The Empire Strikes Back. It's a good design for the chamber, and Vader fits nicely in there. Bag two also constructs the storage where two blasters are kept, as well as the hangar and escape pod track. The one con about this part is how breakable the base is.</div><div><u>Bag Three:</u></div><div>The skeleton is constructed, and even that has features. It has the button that ejects the escape pod into nothingness. It also has the place where you can hold Vader's lightsaber. The triangular construction is very interesting with all those elbow hinges.</div><div><u>Bag Four:</u></div><div>Bag four builds the structure that holds the command bridge in place. That structure also holds Palpatine's hologram, the gun rack cover, and Vader's helmet placer. The helmet feature is somewhat flimsy, but if you press the handlebar pieces on the helmet, it's actually quite effective. The hologram is very cool, and the two-sticker technique to make it look real is very clever. I think a transparent blue minifigure of Palpatine would also serve well as a hologram, but it's not likely that they will develop that.</div><div><u>Bag Five:</u></div><div>The engines and escape pod are constructed. The engines are first, and they are a thing of beauty! The ball cups are used for the smaller ion engines, but the half ball pieces aren't used, but transparent 3x3 disks, which surprisingly fit snug into the socket. The look of it is great, and looks awesome next to the three larger engines. The large engines use the turbo tank wheels, and I like them as engines rather than wheels. The escape pod is also great. It's held firmly in place before the button is used to shunt it out. The pod can fit a minifigure if leaned back far enough. I've fit the two droids in there a lot and just cast them into ""space"".</div><div><u>Bag Six:</u></div><div>Not much to say here, just the first few panels are put on. The front two top panels open up to help shunt the pod out of the ship.</div><div><u>Bag Seven:</u></div><div>This bag makes the big gray panels that make up most of the ship. Also, the four (which should really be six or eight) turbolasers are constructed, and I love the design of those weapons. They can rotate and elevate.</div><div><u>Bag Eight:</u></div><div>Bag eight makes the main section of the command tower. You can attach and detach this entire section from the main ship by pulling up a lever at the back of the ship and simply lifting it off. The command bridge also opens from the rear, and here you can fit two minifigures, as long as they are standing right next to each other and one of them is touching the other's butt.</div><div><u>Bag Nine:</u></div><div>The deflector shield generator domes are constructed here. I like the technique used to build them, with all the wing plates and such.</div><div><u>Bags Ten and Eleven:</u></div><div>These two bags make essentially the same thing. Here, there is a red button at the side you can push to fire one of the green laser things. You have to more flick the button to give the laser some distance. It's not bad, actually. It's better than some of the flick missile designs in later sets.</div><div><u>Bag Twelve:</u></div><div>Not much so say here, either. All it does is complete the ship, giving it a sinister appearance.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Stickers - 9/10 - Thirteen is a lot, but for a ship this big, it's not a lot.</div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Great parts selection, especially for the engines.</div><div>Minifigures - 10/10 - All great selections, but it could've used more Imperial officers.</div><div>Star Destroyer - 10/10 - An excellent design loaded with features, though breakable if you drop it.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 9.75/10 - It's an amazing set with a lot to offer. If still available on eBay, I recommend it!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"tomalphin","2014-01-13T02:55:25.963Z","Good model of a classic Star Wars  ship, but don't show off the interior.","<p><strong>About me:</strong> I am an AFOL who has been building at least 1 set each year for my whole life, and I&#39;ve been buying a lot of used sets lately to sort out and build. I build most sets under 500 pieces as a &quot;puzzle build&quot;, without using the instructions.&nbsp; This set is too large, so I happily used the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Initial impressions:</strong> I love the original trilogy, so this set was exciting to me.&nbsp; It was also my first &quot;big&quot; Star Wars ship which was interesting, since I didn&#39;t know how the exterior panels were going to work.&nbsp; I found the set as part of a large lot of used bricks, but this was the set that interested me most.&nbsp; Having recently completed the classic 10188 Death Star, I was excited to build something big, but not quite so time consuming.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience: </strong>The build really has four phases.&nbsp; First you build the floor of the ships interior, then you build a massive triangle out of hinges and Technics bricks, then you cover the&nbsp; frame with a veneer of plates, and finally, you build the upper structure containing the bridge.&nbsp; I enjoyed the technics part, but found the interior designed to hold the minifigures quite lacking. The exterior attaches in a clever manner, and I really enjoy how the upper section of the ship is attached using a clip which you need to release to expose the ship&#39;s interior.&nbsp; Lastly, I absolutely loved the design for the bridge, which opens up with a clever hinging system which allows you to place minifigs in the bridge.</p>

<p><strong>Finished model:</strong> As I already noted, the way you access the bridge, as well as the way you release the upper section to open the ship is excellent.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the interior of the main ship is very lacking.&nbsp; It feels like an afterthought, as there are some seats and decorations haphazardly arranged, and the technic beams obstruct clear pathways through the interior.&nbsp; It feels sloopy, and doesn&#39;t match the high finish quality of the exterior.&nbsp; Lastly, the finished ship isn&#39;t that durable - the exterior panes want to detach from their hinged attachment points.&nbsp; Good display piece, just leave it closed.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> 7/10 on a 10 point scale.&nbsp; Fun build and a good looking ship, but I didn&#39;t like the interior design.</p>

<p><em><strong>Using the instructions, this model took about 3.5 hours to build.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Minifigures&nbsp;(9/10)</strong></p>

<p>It was pretty good choice of minifigures. Not counting the mouse droid 8 was good. It has the imperial inspection Darth Vader, which was a good choice of a Vader. Tarkin was a basic Tarkin and was pretty basic. The storm troopers were exclusive with flesh colored heads, JUST flesh. The rest were good.</p>

<p><strong>Star Destroyer (9/10)</strong></p>

<p>There was a lot of unused space. Why did they do this, I really don&#39;t know. It gets rid of the greatness of what they could&#39;ve made. It was still good though. The play features is the escape pod which you can drop out of the bottom. Another is the Darth Vader helmet loader, which never works. And finally a lightsaber bolt launcher. Those are some pretty darn good play features. On the outside you can open the bridge and put two minfigures in there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what&#39;s great, what&#39;s good, whats Meh!</p>

<p>Building Experience - Back in it&#39;s day, this was quite a departure from how space sets had been done before. This big triangular hull is all technic 1 by 16s, technic pins and hinges, covered over with a thin layer of plates. It&#39;s a great technique for achieving big and light creations though can result in lots of small fiddly parts&nbsp;bumping up the parts count. The Technic mechanism for popping off the upper decks is cool.</p>

<p>The Parts - Lots of grey plates, detailing, a few glowing green / yellow &quot;lasers&quot;, those need little spheres for shield generators. Not a bad haul over all. Doesn&#39;t quite reflect Stardestroyer white, but actual white bricks&nbsp;wouldn&#39;t either.</p>

<p>Playability - Well it&#39;s far to big and lightly built to swoosh! Suffers the same as the Millenium Falcon in that regard. It has turrets on the outside to fend off Rebel Scum. On the inside, Vader has his regen tank, and the other minifigs to boss around including a couple of droids, the ships crew, some Storm Troopers and some Royal Guard. Grand Moff Tarkin also makes an appearance to hold Vader&#39;s leash.&nbsp;Getting between the upper and lower decks is involved but there we go. So pretty good overall. You can even prevent the Rebel Alliance surviving the Battle of Yavin by shooting down that pesky escape pod.</p>

<p>Value for money - This is a big set, came in a big box, has 9 minifigs,&nbsp;has a big parts count and dominates&nbsp;a shelf on it&#39;s own. Sure you can get bigger with UCS. But it&#39;s fun and&nbsp;Luke,&nbsp;Leia and Han need something to fight. I mean The Death Stars are hardly a challenge having been destroyed handily twice.</p>

"RundownPear","2022-03-22T15:10:20.303Z","They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore","<p>6211 is a set ahead of its time in many ways. This was Lego&#39;s first attempt at a capital ship, and it is a pretty decent attempt. This is a big, fragile, beautiful build worthy of being one of the highest regarded sets of its time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures are ample and were great for the time. Grand Moff Tarkin, Darth Vader, an Imperial Officer, 2x Imperial Royal Guards, 2x Stormtroopers, and an imperial astromech (these figures vary depending on your version of the set, some have differences such as altered face prints, different colored hands, etc.). The figures all have a place in the set and contribute in a meaningful way and for that, I think this is a perfect figure selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is fragile like any 2006 set however its size is impressive. It is larger than any of the modern Star Destroyers and looks great from some angles, from others it isn&#39;t the best. I&#39;m a big fan of the massive engines in the rear and you hardly notice the overscaled bridge. The interior is great with a lot of scenes taken from Darth Vader&#39;s Super Star Destroyer in Episode V. The meditation chamber, hologram room, and armory are all great places to display Vader and the included stormtroopers and when worked properly the arm which can lift evaders helmet in his chamber is awesome. The VIP escape pod chamber is well done and deploys smoothly. The white contrasts the Royal Guards super well and looks unique. The bridge itself has a small command area which may be inaccurate but is an awesome detail. On the exterior, there are some early rod launchers, a predecessor to the flick-fire missiles, which work surprisingly well if angled properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The feel of this set is great. it is less a Lego model of a Star Destroyer and more of a Legofied Star Destroyer. The negatives of this set mainly lie in its stability. The set itself has two variants of the build with some more stable than others however the difference is negligible. I highly recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of classic LSW and even to people who are looking for a ISD to add to their collection as I expect a remake of the 2014 Star Destroyer relatively soon.&nbsp;</p>
