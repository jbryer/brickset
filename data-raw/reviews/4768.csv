also i am missing boxes with assorted plates. ok, you can order those polybags at s@h, but you hardly get them at normal toy stores. plates for everyone!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This bulk set are all plain basic bricks.. and also contains some new bricks such as orange bricks although the amount of orange bricks are very little. These sets are value for money. If they had more grey pieces then it would be great for castle MOCers.
