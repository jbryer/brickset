i think these small brick boxes are made for petrol stations or shops which normally don't sell toys. for the case you are visiting your nephew, and forgot a present, and your last stop is the petrol station, then this box can be your ultimate makeshift!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It has green, grey, as well as the color you would expect in a bulk tub. Fits in well with my &quot;free-style bricks&quot;, adds to flexability to my creative projects.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
