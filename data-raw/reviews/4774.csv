We recently went through his old Duplo sets and sold them on Ebay because he has &quot;moved up&quot; to the Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Speed Racer and Batman themed sets. He is now 5.  However, he did not want to sell this set! It may be Duplo but it plays like the regular Legos. The size of the plane makes for a pretty cool toy, it is over a foot long and about a foot wide. There are lots of cool accessories like luggage, mail, tools, phones, orange cones, etc that add a lot of detail to the layout. The top of the plane comes off so you can fill it with passengers or with cargo. There is an engine repair shop off to the side and a tower to help you land and take off. Throw in two vehicles and you have a great set. I would deduct a quarter point for the &quot;runway&quot; that comes with the set, it is made of cardboard and is part of the box the set comes in. We still have ours but it is ripped and torn. A great set for little guys if you can find it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
