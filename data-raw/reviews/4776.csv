This one only comes with a few pieces and does not require much in the way of construction, but once you have it together, it is pretty cool. You have two sections of hose that can be used to pump the fuel into the plane, or as my little likes to pretend, it can be an airport fire truck and it sprays water on a fire. You can also remove the fuel tank and with some blocks turn the truck into a pickup truck or pretty much any other kind of truck. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
