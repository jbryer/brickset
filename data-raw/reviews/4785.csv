The negative point, this is the 5th type of roadplate. To make a nice layout with the several types is not possible. You need several separate layouts to make it nice.

"RISadler","2009-02-02T06:05:16.14Z","Good parts, bad combination...","Individually the plates are great, as they are designed for the now standard 6-wide vehicles. The problem, hence the low rating, is the combination of a straight and a cross as a set. I always need more straight streets (and I assume so dies everyone else), but now have to purchase double the number of sets. I also end up with many crosses I don't need.

"alva","2011-04-07T04:31:31.59Z","Must Have Things for my city, but could I get something more useful?","This set and the 7281 are two sets that you must own to build your own city. There's no way you can build your city if you don't have any road. So, luckily for us, Lego come with their special roadplate. Imagine if Lego doesn't have any road baseplate and you have to build the roads by using a regular baseplate and covering it with a lot of grey plates, must be cost a fortune to build roads around your city, right?:P<br><br>But there's a couple of things that I think Lego can provide us better with this road plate :<br>1. The price <br>I think their price is too expensive. They should be cost less than the regular baseplate cause most of the road surface is flat, and a bit thinner compared with the regular baseplate.<br>2. The packaging<br>They come in two, making it hard for me to build a city. Definitely, we need the long road more compared with the intersection part, so we have a lot of unused intersection but still need more long road. I think Lego should come with single road plate packaging, so we can buy only parts that we needed.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,1
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-03-10T22:13:14.093Z","Two Lane Black Top","<p>Hello. This is another base plate review. These road types are flat and come in packs of two. They are darkest grey&nbsp;with white prints and offer no building value in themselves.</p>

<p>But of course they are brilliant! The interaction you can have with them is superb and the build value is quite high like this allowing bridges, roadblocks, flyovers and drive-under buildings or even tunnels to be implemented. The drain prints are really quite good but I find the multi crossings a bit much, but then I always have and it makes cross-roads safer. I&#39;m probably just a sore Brit who never got a roundabout. That would be nice though would it not?</p>

<p>The dotted lines&nbsp; obviously a a far stray from the old light grey&nbsp;with green and white solid lines which I prefer but then I am getting older... The central line looks great at least instead of the even older solid line which was not great. I do not know what country they&nbsp;base (pun) these on but perhaps they are just Legoland&nbsp;designs which seems fine. There have been various types over the years, remember the grass edged plates.</p>

<p>The commitment to these remains a bit of a strain; they are too thin for plate dimension matching, they are not plates! No pressing down or building <em>with</em> on to other models but for the price they should be! Why the contradiction then? Basically they are a pain in the back for money, quality and building in to large designs but what they can do, they do very well;<br />
Lego vehicle movement, traffic jams, races, they let pedestrians cross and have mishaps, stories evolve, they form back drops and settings for the larger town or city, they can be tilted and connected to make beautiful ramps to roll vehicles down, you can set up or connect any business or building you want roadside and lay train tracks over them if you like. They can be&nbsp;laid out lengthways to keep layouts against a wall or arranged like a proper town plan.</p>

<p><strong>Hit</strong><strong> The Road Jack</strong><br />
Still not sold on them?&nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t blame you because of the cost for many gets high. true enough I can not gush about these and they are not my favourite but the colour&nbsp;is spot on with a great print. Dimensionally some variety might be nice, maybe including features alongside such as a stream or pond or use a 48x48&nbsp;baseplate&nbsp;for a train track and road combination especially for the curves which is not easy to fix on current road plate layouts. Happy driving.</p>

"AETerry","2012-01-16T11:02:55.187Z","Straight & Crossroad Plates Review","If you collect any of the City/Town sets, eventually you find that 
having road plates are an absolute must and essential with the City 
planning and layout. And they certainly enhance play.<br><br>On these 
new plates, the roads are a bit wider to accommodate the newer City 
vehicles that are in turn larger too. It means that there's fewer studs 
on the sides for building on. That doesn't really seem to bother me too 
much except with trying to connect up the older road plates, you can see
 the differences in width.<br><br>How many will you need? It depends on 
the size of your LEGO City. Start with just a couple to begin with and 
expand out as the City grows obviously.<br><br>My only real complaint is
 the overall price at $15 for two plates. Another complaint for this set is that there should be a pack that focuses on having two straight plates so people can pick up more of those.<br><br>Also avoid resellers that jack 
up the price as buying these directly from LEGO is the best deal unless 
you've found a large lot of numerous plates for a good value.",TRUE,3,2,3,5,3
"WoutStopmotion","2014-10-09T12:51:27.717Z","Best set ever made.","<p>This is one of the most amazing sets in my opinion. It&#39;s absolutely awesome, in terms of design, looks, play functions, et cetera.<br />
<br />
<b>Building Experience</b><br />
<br />
There is SO much building experience in this set. Lego has used a lot of awesome features and techniques that i haven&#39;t seen before, it&#39;s mindblowing. How you can put the plates against eachother or stack them without even having studs on the underside. It was an amazing experience to build this set up.<br />
<br />
<b>Parts</b><br />
<br />
A great parts pack! EVERY part in this set comes printed. The printing on the parts is pristine, the brick colours perfectly manage to display the white detailing from the printing. I can&#39;t imagine how hard it was to create a mold for most of these parts. Come on, big plates with studs removed in the middle AND printing!? Whow!<br />
<br />
<b>Playability</b><br />
<br />
Do you know the term &quot;swooshing&quot;? It is frequently used by Lego builders when they build spaceships. Well, this set can be anything, including the most thin spaceship ever built by space people ever! It&#39;s just so amazing to grab this model on it&#39;s side and then swoosh it. The fact that as a spaceship it can be so record-breaking thin... let me ask you a question, what would you feel like if you had the thinnest spaceship on the world? You&#39;d probably feel good! And besides a spaceship, there&#39;s a lot of other features for this set. But i won&#39;t explain their awesomeness, you should find out yourself!<br />
<br />
<b>Value for Money</b><br />
<br />
As said before, EVERY piece in this set is printed, but not only that, every piece in this set is unique to it. You won&#39;t find them in any other set (if i&#39;m correct). That is why the price is so amazing. A collection of unique printed pieces for just 10 bucks? Really Lego? Something so good for such a low price!?</p>

<h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4>

<p>Just... whow. The set design is mindblowing, the parts are rare, there&#39;s a ton of playability and the price of this set is the best deal you can ever get on a Lego set. If you see this set, you should instantly get it. No matter what. I&#39;d pick this over every other set, even a Cloud City, Grand Emporium, or heck, even an Airport Shuttle!</p>

"Scott1","2016-02-19T00:49:18.36Z","Why would Lego do this?","<p>If you&#39;re building a big city, especially a modular one, you will NEED these plates. The plates are fantastic! The way Lego sells them? Not so much.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The plates come shrink-wrapped. There is a piece of paper covering it and I would like to talk about it. First of all, it uses the old 72xx numbering system. Second, it has&nbsp;the 2005 Fire and Police stations on it. So I&#39;m guessing that Lego has been combining the plates for a while.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It comes with two plates. Two DIFFERENT plates. Now in 2002 Lego released road plates just like these but with green studded areas and two of the same plate per pack. So when you needed plates you could just get the number you needed. For some reason they decided to combine them. So now if you want 4 Straight plates you need to buy 4 packs, and end up with 4 Crossroad plates that you won&#39;t need. In this case, I need 4 straight, 3 T-junction, and 1 Crossroad. So I need to buy 7 packs, at $105. I will end up with 3 Curved, and 3 Crossroad that I won&#39;t use, a waste of space and money.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great when used in a city.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I wish Lego would make&nbsp;them separate again, so we won&#39;t have to buy plates we don&#39;t need!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Jack_Sassy","2021-06-21T19:49:24.57Z","Quite helpful","<p>When it comes to city building, this is the set that you might buy a whole lot of. I&#39;ve heard many folks complain about these road sections being in one pack instead of them being separated, but at the time I bought it, I was too young to care about this problem. Only thing I can remember is me being very excited and happy because I got my first two baseplates and very useful ones too, mind you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are just two pieces, yet give so much room for creativity and can easily help on expanding your city. As it says it in the title - quite helpful. One of the main problems are that these two pieces cost around 12.00 euros, at least where I&#39;m living.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To end this short review, I wanted to honour the final version of Lego road baseplates, and it&#39;s quite a shame that they have decided to abandon it and instead make road plates. Nonetheless, I&#39;m sure that new road plates will serve their purpose just fine, but these baseplates will live on in our hearts forever.</p>
