I personally prefer this set of one &quot;T&quot; plate and a curve and recomend more of these if you are on a limited buget.  The curve plate both makes for a more interesting and less blocked layout and gives you more building area.  The &quot;T&quot; plate is great for the turn off's into the various set's you've bought like the hospital, fire department, or police station.  The crosswalk adds detail and a break for those sets.  My only down side is I can never build a good corner building to put near the curves so often I make flowerbeds or place trees on grass made with flat green/brown tiles outlined by single thickness grey bricks.  Either way the wider roads allow for more play with the modern vehicles though most construction vehicles are still too wide.  Now if all the sets driving areas would just line up well with the roads.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-07-28T17:22:16.45Z","Roadplates are a must for any city","I got this because I needed a T-intersection in my city. The new shade of gray is nicer than the old one. If your city has too much grass, this set is perfect. These roadplates are compatible with the ones before these (ie. the ones released in 2003), as they (and the 2003 ones) have the same road width of 20 studs wide. To create a fairly large city you must buy at least 5-10 of these, but if you're like me and want to fit a compact, high-rise city onto one street you'll only need one or two sets of roadplates. I wish each set came with only one kind of road plate. Pricewise, this costed 17.99 CAD and I think it sucks because the price used to be a third of this a couple years ago. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ryan498","2011-06-25T09:40:54.18Z","Great, but...","This item is great, however as compared to the other baseplates this one is quite simple with not much colour. For the price I paid I expected there to be a bit more detail, Lego could easily add Drains or anything else onto the road.<br><br>Also the roads are wider than the older green plates I am used to, this means there are less studs for building on. I think the price of this should be no more than Â£6.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"AETerry","2011-11-04T00:33:01.603Z","Road Plates Review","If you collect any of the City/Town sets, eventually you find that having road plates are an absolute must and essential with the City planning and layout. And they certainly enhance play.<br><br>On these new plates, the roads are a bit wider to accommodate the newer City vehicles that are in turn larger too. It means that there's fewer studs on the sides for building on. That doesn't really seem to bother me too much except with trying to connect up the older road plates, you can see the differences in width.<br><br>How many will you need? It depends on the size of your LEGO City. Start with just a couple to begin with and expand out as the City grows obviously.<br><br>My only real complaint is the overall price at $15 for two plates. So avoid resellers that jack up the price as buying these directly from LEGO is the best deal unless you've found a large lot of numerous plates for a good value.<br>",TRUE,4,1,3,5,3
"nivracer","2011-04-25T10:01:11.2Z","great for a city","The road plates&nbsp;are great because if u have carpet you cant stand minifigs on carpet without trying 5 min for one stop motion pic, and it will look like buildings placed randomly if you dont have roads.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Scott1","2016-02-19T00:50:37.06Z","Why would Lego do this?","<p>If you&#39;re building a big city, especially a modular one, you will NEED these plates. The plates are fantastic! The way Lego sells them? Not so much.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The plates come shrink-wrapped. There is a piece of paper covering it and I would like to talk about it. First of all, it uses the old 72xx numbering system. Second, it has the 2005 Fire and Police stations on it. So I&#39;m guessing that Lego has been combining the plates for a while. <strong>EDIT</strong>: I realized that Lego has changed the design for it; they are now wrapped in a thicker plastic, similar to the bags pieces come in. They also have the new&nbsp;2014 Fire and Police stations on them now.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It comes with two plates. Two DIFFERENT plates. Now in 2002 Lego released road plates just like these but with green studded areas and two of the same plate per pack. So when you needed plates you could just get the number you needed. For some reason they decided to combine them. So now if you want 4 Straight plates you need to buy 4 packs, and end up with 4 Crossroad plates that you won&#39;t need. In this case, I need 4 straight, 3 T-junction, and 1 Crossroad. So I need to buy 7 packs, at $105. I will end up with 3 Curved, and 3 Crossroad that I won&#39;t use, a waste of space and money.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great when used in a city.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I wish Lego would make them separate again, so we won&#39;t have to buy plates we don&#39;t need!</p>
