"sudorum","2008-10-29T15:57:33.077Z","""You will lose... everything.""","Though this set might seem scattered and not very well thought out, it really is. It comes with several good minifigures including Voldemort, Harry, Lucias, Pettigreu, and several skeletons. One of these skeletons is made of rare green and black pieces. Both of the small graves lift up to reveal skeletal parts. The medium sized grave has a skeleton that pops out, and the large grave lifts up to reveal a pit of snakes. My favorite part of the set is the mortuary looking building, which has an underground crypt beneath the floor where you can store stuff. My one complaint is that pieces in this set are lost very easily.",FALSE,5,5,5,4,3
"woodall_aidan","2011-11-08T17:48:03.123Z","""Expelliarmus! Avada Kedavra!""","This set is one of the four great Goblet of Fire sets. It portrays the scene in the Little Hangleton graveyard where the Dark Lord Voldemort comes back and Harry Potter duels with him (thus the name Graveyard Duel). The set consists of five minifigures, a mini building, some graves that can open up, and some other background stuff. It also comes with a cauldron that Wormtail used to bring back the Dark Lord. The figures are Harry Potter (who looks way too happy), Lord Voldemort (with a glow-in-the-dark head), Lucius Malfoy as a Death Eater, Wormtail, and a skeleton. The set also comes with the grave of Thomas Riddle Sr. and a large chained up fence. The grave is also filled with snakes, including Nagini, and the headstone has a statue of Death, where Harry is held captive. This set gets a 5/5 overall.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
