I ended up giving him a different set because I was embarrassed to give this to someone as a gift. Maybe a young child would like this set but I just opened it up and sorted the pieces by color and put them in my collection. The animals are too blocky and the tree is flat.If you like the 1x1 bricks with eyes this set has quite a few. Oh well, at least it was only a buck!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
