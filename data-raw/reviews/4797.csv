Basically it is the same as the previous release 7166, but with the revised shades of grey. The wings raise and lower as before. The main selling point of this set for those that have the original are the additional extras that were not previously included – mainly new or revised Minifigs to recreate the scene of the Emperor’s arrival in the Death Star hangar from the in ROTJ. 

The Emperor now has a grey face, but the Royal Guards appear to be the same as before. The Minifigs now included that were not in the previous set are: Vader (unchanged) and 4 revised Stormtroopers with new legs and 2 flesh coloured Imperial Commanders. This makes an impressive 10 SW Minifigs in one set – perhaps Lego are listening at last and we can expect similar quantities in future SW sets and re – releases. 

The box continues with the black background and “Original Trilogy” branding, but is not embossed like some have been recently. Also included are a small truck and tool trailer and a gun emplacement with a crane on the end - I am not sure I remember seeing these in the movie, but they may have been in the background and they add to the parts count anyway. 

I expect many people will give this set a maximum score just for the quantity of Minifigs, but I feel an opportunity was missed here, like with the re – issued Y – Wing, to upgrade the original model. I notice the continued use of round 1x yellow transparent plates for the wing and tail lights, whereas the mini version uses square 1x tiles – surely the latter would look better on the larger model? My main criticism though is the front of the Shuttle does just not look right – especially from certain angles – too short and too fat, and the opportunity should have been taken to upgrade like with the Falcon and X – Wing. For this missed opportunity to improve the Shuttle I will have to deduct a point. Otherwise a great set.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-04T21:34:08Z","Totally Imperial!","    The first thing I thought of when I first saw this set was being released was that everything in it was Imperial! No lousy jedi to disturb concentration of minifigs! The Imperial shuttle is slightly redesigned and looks smaller on the box than it really is! I personally love the cockpit canopy! The wing system works nice too.  I really charish this set because it includes 4 stormtroopers!!!! 4 of them! They even have redesigned pants too. The first 2 stormtroopers carry the standard megaphone rifle and the other 2 carry missile launchers or something, making them classified as Shocktroopers (Battlefront)!  The Royal Guards are also a pleasant thing to have. They have the nice, lingering red suits, helmets, and capes and they use the electro-poles as weapons. Ofcourse you get another Vader and he is unchanged. It is good that you get the Emporer too, he is unchanged too (I like his walking stick)! The two Imperial officers have a new cap that beats the last one by far. The one major thing that bugged me is that the heads are peach!!!!! Well- you can fix this easily! The little commands station is cool and it even has a laser turret. The crain works too. To round out this set, the hover-tram cargo thing. It is like the rebels' ones and is just a color change! This set rocks, you get 10 pure Imperial minifigs (SUPER), an great ship, cool command post, cargo tram and the Empire's glory! This is a super set!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-06T19:24:56Z","Again.","Imperial Shuttle is as good as before (maybe because its the same?:D ).I dont know about this one I like the new Stormies and Grey Face for Palpatine and you can`t have
enough Darth Vaders I don&#180;t know about this crane thing and I HATE THIS FLESH COLOURED FACES! Who has that stupid idea? They could at least use the DUPLO flesh which isn`t perfect but a lot better than anything else.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-12T22:44:06Z","Bad Ass with all the mini figs","I just picked up this set and its an awesome set. 
The greatest part of the set is definitely the mini figs. 
10 mini figs in all, more then any set I have ever seen. I think I have to get 2-3 more of these sets to stock up on troopers, imperial guardsmen and imperial staff members. 

The ship itself looks similar to the previous shuttle with what appears to be less grey and more white all the way around. playability is solid as this is solidly put together. whish I could open the wings simultaneiously, but oh well. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-28T16:08:38Z","YES I CAN GET IT!!!","Well first off, FRED what sort of review is that i think this is really nice, it is basicly the same shuttle as before so you can just go on supporting the first one but you have no reason to hate this one. This comes with some sweet things like redesigned stormtroopers, imperial officers (but dont get me started about the person who had the brilliant idea of haveing peach skin), and well... the imperial gaurds and darth vader, YES want them so bad and when i missed out on the imperial guards and shuttle first time i was so disapointed but no thanks to LEGO i can get it with a cool bunch of guys, i just wish they had kept the shuttle pilot from the first one.

With those rare printed Stormtroopers and the Emperor himself, how can you go wrong?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Emperor Palpetine: Probably the nicest fig in the set, with a very cool face and those awesome Sith Robes. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Darth Vader: Darth Vader could be special, but because he's included in almost every set in one form or another he's really nothing interesting. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Royal Guards: I like Royal Guards. They're nice. They're very fun to play with, and I love the helmets. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stormtrooper(s): Four actually special Stormtroopers that aren't your regualr run-off-the-mill ones! With awesome printed legs only available in this set and Cloud City, they're great. Now why couldn't have done something like this to the Darth Vader in this set?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The set is mainly a spaceship and two construction carts. I'll start with the carts. The carts are obviously supposed to be adding to the playability, but all you can do is drive that little box over, lift it up on the crane, put it down, and then it gets somehow magically blown up with force power. They're nice though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spaceship is very nice, and the best Imperial Shuttle ever made in my opinion, even with the newly released super bulbous spaceship that is bigger than my head. (And my heads pretty big) I really like the platform inside for the Emperor and his gaurds, instead of them just falling out when the spaceship door opens. Although, you really have to experiment with minifigure positioning to get them to fit. The entire shuttle is nice as well. My only complaint is that there should have been one more Stormtrooper to pilot the ship, and while we're on the topic, one more Imperial Guard to sit in the second chair on the construction thingy. I guess that was just too many minifigs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, LEGO 7264 Imperial Inspection is a great set recreating an iconic scene from Star Wars. It has some very nice minifigures, and many of them, but no good guys. It needed like a Luke, or a Han Solo, or even a Chawbacca to add a little more playability. That is, of course, why my playability rating is a two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks, </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LegoMunchy88</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4
