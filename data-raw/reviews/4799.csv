"sudorum","2008-02-11T18:23:57.53Z","Supergiant Sphere","A definate must-have set for any major Star Wars lego fan. This set must have taken forever to plan out&nbsp;and design. The exterior detail is amazing and the lasers add a nice spark to it. Minifigures can't really be placed inside of the set, but if you have the right pieces, you can place a floor in the complete half. The stand for the Death Star acts as a support beam and balance, but can't be removed. Also, the miniature Imperial Star Destroyer doesn't look very accurate, but it will do.",FALSE,5,3,5,1,5
"deepseadawn","2008-12-29T01:31:28.827Z","Will go down as a classic to be sure","This set was indeed amazingly detailed and enjoyable to put together. It was the most challenging one I've ever done. They did a wonderful thing to have you START with the display stand and build up from that, whereas the other vehicles in the Ultimate Collector Series have you build the ship first and do the display stand last for you to balance the ship on. 

Pros: Level of detail, instruction book was awesome, as was the laser!

Cons: Some pieces were missing in the set I received. The spokes in the brown Lego ""ship's wheels"" for the top and bottom were a little too short to keep some of the panels in place. I had to resort to epoxy for good measure.

Can't wait to do the Death Star released in 2008 with all the mini-figs, IF I can find the room to put it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pizpag","2008-03-25T17:54:52.967Z","The best set created yet!","I recieved this set as an easter present in 2008 and built it in 2 days. This is my favorite set yet and stands as a trophy in my room. To think that the designers can plan out and put into legos this set is amazing. The star destroyer is also amazing. The laser is so cool and the detail put into the partially constructed part blows me away. THANK YOU LEGO!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
