"Pegasi","2006-04-17T18:54:19Z","A great set, with only a few flaws","I bought this set when I was flying from bristol-amsterdam.
 The plane has two main areas, the cockpit and a small cargo area,
In the cockpit, there is a place that (somewhat snugly) holds a minifigure, fits a chair, and has one of the control stick things that you find in the passenger plane. The cargo area fits all of the accesories that the pilot comes with, wich includes binoculars, a backpack,(not openable)and a variaty of other tools. Also, unlike in many other sets, the spairparts can fit in the storage area as well, if you are in short supply of room. It has a nice target pattern on all of the wings, wich also fits the type of plane quite nicely. 
The only flaws are, the wheels tend to come off when you bang it onto the floor of your hotel room, and there are the dreaded stickers. All of the multicolored elelments are actually stickers. The other bad thing is, at least the target pattern looks really tacky if you leave them off.

Other than those though, if you happen to see it in an airline catolouge, or on ebay, I command you to buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
