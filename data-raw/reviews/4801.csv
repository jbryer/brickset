Its pretty nice I like the wheels and the spining lever pice you know the handles. A nice little set for 1$ I got 3 of this set its pretty fun if you have a castle. Nice set buy if you find for 1$",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legowarroir","2007-12-12T10:08:28.937Z","Cool catupult!","I got this with a minifig and a comic (if you read my other review). But to make the catapult work, you kinda have to smash the big long piece.

"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:44:46.45Z","No mini figures - few pieces - little price","The main reason I own this set is due to the fact I saw it at Walmart for a dollar. I do have Knight Kingdom sets and slid it into another set. Is pretty much boring and its only appeal is that it does add to the defense of the catle. Don't hurt yourself trying to find it - its just O K .",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"savepuffy","2008-02-17T09:32:53.92Z","Boring but Cheap","I got this set a while back from dollarama (noticing by the name a place where everythings a dollar)I was happy at first to see brand name lego and the knights kingdom sign but this set is dull. I don't know if that little wheel is supposed to make the catapault  fire because mine doesn't.  27 pieces for $1 canadian is pretty good but this set just doesn't thrill me. The only way to fire the catapault is to smack the end of the catapault really hard so it goes far.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-02T15:59:18.077Z","Well made","This is a very small set, packed in a polybag, like in the image. It have an armor for horse as the front of it, looks liking cool. Is well made, being different to the other catapults, have another system, pushing a side, to the other launchs. Are small pieces that it can shots, is an addition for the playsets of the theme. Another useful thing is the color, very compatible with the knights of the king mathias, like jayko, with the light blue color. It don't have a minifigure, but have more pieces than the new castle &quot;impulse&quot; sets, being more useful, without being army builder or have buildings, it still great for one small and cheap set...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-07-30T11:32:17.81Z","Simple and Cool","This set is real simple. Yet real fascinating. I like the front horse piece that I took it off this one and placed it on a LEGO horse. I got this LEGO polybag alongside Jayko 5999 in a book/comic title 'Lego Knights Kingdom - Adventure Box'",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-20T14:47:52.39Z","Got this at LEGOLAND!","I have two of these, and are boring, with a catapult, horse head ornament piece, and two 1x1 round brick as ammunition.

Pros:

Horse head ornament piece
Rare wheels
""Wheel"" piece

Cons:

Boring
Catapult doesn't really work
Horse ornament piece falls off a lot

Overall, a boring set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"ellchr","2009-06-13T11:25:05.107Z"," Decent Set, I guess..."," I got this set at a book fair. Well, I really bought a little box with a knight minifig 
and a comic alongside the bag. 
 
 By itself without a minifig the set is pretty pathetic, but with a good and bad minifig it is a lot of fun! A couple of months after I got this set, my mom got me the castle of morcia for Christmas, and then the catapult really had a meaning in this world!

 The wheels that come in this set are extrodinarily amazing. They're perfect for building any other medieval vehicle,


 If you come upon this set, buy it!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-12-02T19:51:54.027Z","Stocking Stuffer is thy name!","<p>And that pretty much sums this set up... the only reason I got it was as a stocking stuffer, so I won't complain on the price as a gift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't really one of the better catapult builds I've seen with LEGO Castle... and I've seen a lot of catapult builds over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No minifigure makes this even worse... that'd have given this set better playability. Otherwise there's just not much that you can do with this set.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,5
"tkettle9719","2011-12-27T12:26:40.797Z","My cheapest Lego set ever...","<p>I found this set at Walmart at the reasonably good price of 1 dollar. Seeing the set at this price was extremely thrilling, and the finished set looks marvelous.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The catapult launch goes extremely far.<br></li><li>-The piece selection is rather genius and creative.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The plate was a bad choice; it makes the set look off. <br></li><li>-The horse head is also a bit weird.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>The catapult function is really quite amazing, but has truly limited playability. I'd buy it if it were 5 dollars, because it's that good. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
