"Carl","2009-10-15T22:38:54.827Z","GREAT SET!","This is an awesome depiction of a pear. With just the right colours it is a perfect set for little kids. Really cool.

The base is made out of two up diagonal pieces, a four by one flat and then a three up diagonal pair(pun). The leaf is made of a black dot piece, followed by a dark green one by three flat and then another black dot on top of that. And lastly is a dark green diagonal up on the one by three to make the leaf look curled up. Just like a real pear. AWESOME!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
