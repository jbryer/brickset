"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-30T14:00:01.64Z","my first basic set","This is a great set. I don't normally have basic sets but I was bored so I built this out of my lego.

pros:
very easy to build
basic bits

cons:
its flat so it doesn't look like a normal orange
the tan stud looks out of place
not very exiting

I think this set is really cool 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
