"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-07T08:06:34Z","There is such a thing as a free launch","I obtained this as a freebie reward for buying lots of the new Episode III sets from my local Lego store. It is a nice little set and appears to be fiarly accurate from what i can tell - given that the movie is not out yet. My main point of reference is the larger version 7256, but as something nice for nothing it has to rate a maximum score.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-07T15:31:59Z","Great freebie!!","I got this free from the legoshop when I bought 7252 and I have to say I'm very impressed. I'm not the biggest fan of the mini's but this one really impressed me. A very authentic version of the larger model yet somehow this seems even more manuverable. A nice selection of pieces and when you pay nothing you really can't complain. Definatly one of the best mini's and well worth getting your hands on.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-16T17:33:01.573Z","Okay...","I don't know why this set is not in the scale as the rest of the mini star wars sets, but it is a good set nevertheless.
I only wish it came with a mini tri-fighter and vulture droid, then you could have a real battle in space with your mini-sets!
The reproduction is fairly faithful, even if the minifig-scale model looks so much better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"general_veers","2008-02-19T10:59:52.747Z","Not a bad set","This set is definately not as good as the larger one. 

Pros: 
Dosent break easily

Cons:
Looks weird
It would be better if they released a mini tri fighter or something, so you could have dogfights

"starwarsgeek101_","2009-08-06T08:45:58.797Z","Great Mini!","Oddly, I got this for free at a local museum. I liked it, of course I never knew what the price of this was. This set is pretty godd, although the wings can become a little flimsy. This set doesn't provide too much trouble, about a 3 minute build for me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-06-21T09:02:00.843Z","Small, but Fun","I received this set when I entered a Lego competition a couple of years ago, and I'm impressed.

Pros:
Small, easy to transport
Cheap
Good pieces
Wing flaps(yellow pieces) can move
Sturdy
Great playability, especially with other mini sets.
Fast, easy to build.

There isn't much else to say about this set other than that. Like I said, it's cheap, so if it looks interesting, I'd go ahead and but it, especially if you're into mini sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-26T14:05:12.827Z","Great mini!","This is probably my favorite mini set. Well, one of them. I'm surprised that Lego can come up with these detailed yet small models. It doesn't have really anything special. The wings bend and the flaps on the wings move. But outside of that, nothing. You can pretty much see all it offers in the picture.
Overall, great. I can't get over the accuracy of the model. If you don't want to get the regular Jedi Starfighters, then get this. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Unknown_User2596","2009-08-07T18:03:27.123Z","6966 Jedi Starfighter-for free!","I remember back in '05 Lego stores had this special promotion in which you get this set free with the ourchase of any Ep III set. Apparently while I was browsing the selection an employee came over and gave me this set for free(back then I never knew about the aformentioned promotion)! So I decided to build it during lunch, and the finishing product looks great!

Pros +Cons:

Pros
-neat design
-has some cool recolored pieces
-swoshable
-for free you really can't go wrong

Cons
-To me it looks a bit bulky
-yellow flap thingies look wildly out of poportion
-No landing gear- but since this is mini scaled it doesn't have to have them

Definetely recommended!!

"starhopper","2009-12-05T17:26:56.687Z","One of my favorites","I've only recently begun to collect the Star Wars minis and this one is one of my favorites. I like the ratchet wings that keep them at the correct angle compared to some of the other sets like the Imperial Shuttle and the X-Wing.

It's simple, fun and a treat to look at. I recommend it. In fact, I bought 2 so I could give one to my 7 year old nephew is who a huge Lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
