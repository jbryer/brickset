"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-29T04:30:59Z","Great mini revival","This is extremely rare in Singapore, a promo item where I found it but not free. It looks excellent anyway, just small enough with a good variety of pieces. It is without paint detail or stickers though, integral to the craft and present in almost every other mini. Grab it if you see it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-09-27T13:48:16.263Z","The republic strikes again!"," This was a promotional set and one of the last mini sets(until now)to be released.One wya to get it is in singapore or through an exclusive set(released through shop at home) with  the large ARC 170 and a trifighter.The problem with this is that you had a 50% chance of getting this or the mini jedi starfigter.
  Lego really made this look like the real thing including the awkward piece in the front and hte red pieces that look like weapons.Also like it's larger version, it comes with the two 'windows'. One problem is that the back cannon looks out of scale compared to the rest of the set.Well, at least they included that piece. It also has the open flap feature to attack those vulture droids.
pros 
relaistic features
high palyibiliyty
cons
back cannon is a bit out of scale
hard to find ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Not difficult to build and great with other minis. Get off ebay now! I got it in a clearance sale  so I would also like the jedi starfighter for my own battle of Coracent!

"asianlego","2008-09-29T12:08:57.967Z","Mini ARC Fighter","I was at the Singapore Formula 1 Night Race recently and I got this small set for SGD $9.90 which is pretty expensive for such a small set but well worth it if you are a collector. This set has many small pieces which makes building a little bit of a hassle if you have large hands (no I do not have large hands) and the tiny sloped piece they place at the front is very awkward and seemed out of place. There are also two black wands which are used for the shooters at the wing tips.

I didn't give this a 5 because there is something about that just looks odd but i can't quite put my finger on it. Oh well, it's still good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoz","2009-01-02T16:13:13.06Z","cool mini","This mini was one of the best to me. The details match the real set almost exactly it's pretty cool to keep on the shelf and look at. It is also good for making a movie and fitting the item in the screen. A really cool set, 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jof","2009-04-24T18:47:36.153Z","OK model, but excellent parts for making other miniscale ships","The model is OK (but I am not a great fan of the new star wars stuff, I guess I am too old)

This is an excellent set for making alternative miniscale ships.  Trapezoid stub wings are really useful.
Standard model has a tendency to loose the main wings.

If fact its so good, I bought 12 of them when the local toy shop cleared out the free give away offers in the sales - thats all they had left.  (stashed 4 of them for a rainy day).  Just a shame they didn't have the jedi fighters as well.

I gave a couple away to my brothers kids & the ones I have are in regular use with my kids (although in a different guise)

Not sure I would pay the current ebay prices for it, but if you are a SW collector, then thats not an issue.

Overall a good set. Much more useful than the classic tie fighter giveaway.

"Kalhiki","2009-11-26T14:10:46.123Z","Another great mini","Along with the Jedi Starfighter, this is exelent. As I said in the Sarfighter review, I can't get over the accuracy. For being a mini, it's amazing. A definately good replacement to the larger ARC. There are guns on each ends of the wings and one in the back. It also has the 4 flapsmaking it resemble an X-wing. Really, that's all.
Overall, a great set. If your on a tight budget and can't get the larger version, definately get this one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
