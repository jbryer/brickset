"Jonamaster","2007-08-02T23:03:26.317Z","This is cool!"," I got this      AFTER i got lego star wars 2 the original trilogy.

 its alittle bit dinky(compared to lego star wars 2)
 But if you had never played lego star wars 2, and got this     ,
 YOU WOULD THINK ITS AWSOME!!(but thats just my opinion.

Pros:
Good caractors
good extras(the ones in lsw2 are better, but they are OK.)
Yoda gets a little chair to ride on!

Cons:
JAR JAR STINKS!!
They need a    gan warrior caractor!

Overall, it diserves a 3.

"legoguysw","2008-01-03T11:41:52.717Z","Great Game, first in many lego titles","My friend bought this, only to find it didnt save properly on his pc. So he gave it to me(he had it on ps2, and it worked fine), and it worked on my computer! Anyway, to the review.
 This game is probably not as good as Lego Star Wars 2, but easier. It does not have all the things LSW2 has, such as bounty hunter missions and red or gold bricks. It has minikits, however, some of which you need to use an internet walkthrough to find if you are having trouble. The graphics are OK, but a bit bad at some points. This game takes about 3 solid days of hard work to finish (days including nights). This doesnt make the game an easy, do it and forget about it game, though. The cutscenes are very funny at some points. Humour is what the game won some of its awards for. Although, LSW2 I think won more awards and was funnier. Some levels are annoying: they take a long time to do and are the type you dont want to waste time going back through to get all the extras for.
The characters:
Some you have to buy at the shop (dexters diner, which you access all the levels from), others you get for free. At the start of a level in free play mode (which you can only get once you have finished the level in story mode with the original characters of that scene), you get to choose one character. You are then given a few more random (but essential to that level) characters you can switch between.
Overall: One of the best lego games so far. However, i reccomend you get Lego Star Wars:The complete saga instead, which i have heard is even better, and includes this game plus LSW2 and new levels.(plus, you get to use the wii remote as a Lightsaber! How cool is that?).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"tauntaunwampa","2008-01-04T05:52:00.653Z","It was good at the time","This game was a good game but when LEGO Star Wars II came ou there was much that could of been done to make it better
firstly there weren't as many extras that were around to play with and not much studs so it was harder to buy things, secondly the space battle were very dissapointing there was not much to shoot and not many good hidding spots for the canisters, Thirdly there were many useless characters like Palpatine and Jar Jar. ANother thing that the missed out on was the battle on the Droid Control Center, It was advertised in evrything but they managed to leave it out (silly,silly,silly)
I have to say this game is on of the most cooperatie of the lot and requires bot (or more) character to work.
Athough i sound like i hate this game i suggest you get it if you cannot afford Playstations3's and WII's (what an odd name?) It does come in useful in the Second game.

I personally like Anakin, because Grievous kidna stinks with fast attacks. Also, NO GUNGAN WARRIOR! and the little walking droid is useless.
Pros:
First of many Lego games that are like this
Nice characters(I like Yoda with his hoverchair)
Cons:
You can't make your characters :-(
Secret level sucks &gt;:-(
CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING!
Force objects don't have that tingle like in the II game
I give it a 4, because of difficulty and sheer annoyingness.
See you next review!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Tar_Domo","2014-09-01T16:07:06.52Z","Best of All LEGO Games","<p>Maybe it&acute;s just the best because it&acute;s the first LEGO SW video game and my LEGO SW collecting started after I had played it. In the game there is just enough everything, not too much of everything.</p>

<p>I gave it 5 stars from parts because the parts in the game look really cool and realistic. It really has not any real LEGO pieces.</p>

<p>When I gave stars from playability I also thought about playing the game. You can spend hours and hours with it without getting tired of it.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- Mos Espa Podrace chapter is the best LEGO SW game level ever made</p>

<p>- A lot to do but not too much different things</p>

<p>- Dexter&acute;s Dinner</p>

<p>- Not too difficult to find the minikits</p>

<p>- Funny videos</p>

<p>- Free play mode</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- You can&acute;t play as Boss Nass (You can in The Complete Saga)</p>

<p>- Just one bonus level</p>

<p>This is still the best game I&acute;ve played.</p>
