Pros:The XBox,etc. has more detail in the movies(Ep. 1 you can do Pod Racing and save Queen Amidala using Royal Guards and Captain Panaka; Ep. 2 you can battle Jango Fett and visit Kamino, battle with the Jedi in the awesome Geonosis arena, and play as Gunships; Ep. 3 you can fight G. Grievous with Commander Cody and Obi-Wan, and you can battle disguised clones in the Jedi Temple)!
There are way more characters on the XBox, etc. version, so buy that instead.

"SJPlego","2007-10-25T19:26:59.467Z","A Good Game","I reviewed this game over the summer... for whatever reason, the review did not come through.  I'm trying again in this review:

In comparison to the other versions, this may seem like junk, but hey – it’s a game for Game Boy Advance, so it’s no surprise. However, despite having less characters and worse graphics, it has unique and fun gameplay.

PACKAGING
Aside from the side bar reading “only for GAME BOY ADVANCE”, the front of the box is not much different from that of other versions. We see Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Grievous, C3-PO, R2-D2, and Maul all standing on fiery magma (ouch, my feet are burned!), with the ominous Vader mask in the background. We also see the rating, which is E, a step down from the other versions which are E +10.
The back shows two in-game screenshots: Chewbacca battling Battle Droids and Clone Troopers; Anakin battling a single Battle Droid while R2-D2 drives around in circles; and a “cutscene” screenshot: Obi-Wan slicing Maul in half. Two little boxes show that the game is only for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, and a caption basically briefing what you do in the game, which is play and battle through the three prequel episodes.

MAIN MENU
This is a major disappointment. For the Game Boy Advance, LEGO Star Wars abandons the idea of having a “hub,” the Dexter’s Diner, for having a simple main menu. Here, you start and load games, then access the levels in either Story Mode or Free Play. Far less creative than having a diner where all the characters hang out.

STORY MODE
From the main menu, after you have started a new game or loaded a saved game, you can access Story Mode. Here, you can play the levels in the three episodes back to back. Your progress is saved as you go, so if you need to exit, you will return to your last save point.
You don’t have to play the episodes in a specific order. All three are unlocked and playable from the start, and you can play one, exit in the middle, and start another.
The main point of Story Mode is to access levels and characters for Free Play. After unlocking all the levels for Free Play, you probably won’t play Story Mode very often.

FREE PLAY
Free Play is basically Story Mode, with two major differences. One, you can access any level you have beaten in Story Mode. Two, you can add one more playable character into your character party for that level. For example, if you have Darth Vader unlocked, you can play as him and Obi-Wan (the Story Mode character for the level) in the first Episode I level. Because of this, you can access areas you are unable to in Story Mode, and have Special Abilities that you don’t have with the Story Mode characters.
There is a disadvantage, though. Unlike Story Mode, your progress is not saved, and as a result if you exit in the middle of one level, you cannot pick up where you left off.

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay for LEGO Star Wars GBA is that you go around battling mainly droids, Tusken Raiders, and Geonosians. As Jedi, you will often have to use the Force on objects to build stairs, push levers, or simply obtain Studs, the currency of the game. As blaster-wielding characters, you often have to blast at targets to open locked doors. And as Astomech Droids, you are constantly hovering over gaps and hacking into computers.
There’s a new feature you have to worry about: Special Abilities. Each character (except for some that are obtainable through cheat code, such as General Grievous and Geonosian) has a Special Ability that they can perform, such as Force Pushes, Guided Rockets, or Lightsaber Toss. However, this is limited use, because you have Stamina. A Lightsaber near your health meter and Stud count represents stamina here. The longer the blade, the more stamina you have. The shorter… well, you know. Every time you use a Special Ability, you use up stamina. If you run out of stamina, you must wait for it to recharge. In the meantime, you can’t use a Special Ability again.
Occasionally, you have to rescue fellow Minifigs, destroy a certain amount of enemies, or complete a task within a certain amount of time. Five levels end in boss fights, in which you clash Lightsaber-to-Lightsaber with Sith Jedi.
Occasionally, you’ll see a “cutscene,” showing what happens in the story. However, with the supposed definition of a cutscene being a short video in a game, this is not exactly a cutscene, but rather a series of cutscene-style pictures, with added music and sound effects. I can understand why this was done, but half the humor in the other versions came from the cutscenes. As a result, this version is not very funny. As a result from that result, there is little (other than the presence of Minifigs and LEGO Bricks) that defines this as a LEGO spoof of Star Wars, rather than just another video game of the prequel episodes.

ENEMIES
There are three basic types of enemies: Normal, Sub-Boss, and Boss. Normal enemies are the most common, carrying around blasters and firing at you, taking only a few shots before deconstructing. There is only one type of Sub-Boss, which is a laser that fires extra powerful blasts at you. This can be found on most levels, and the only thing identifying it as a Sub-Boss would be the health meter (see health meters section). Bosses are Jedi who work for the Sith, and they are as follows: Darth Maul, Count Dooku (you fight him twice), General Grievous, and Anakin Skywalker.

HEALTH METERS
In the other versions, your character will always have maximum of four hearts. If you lose a heart, you must find a heart (obtained from an enemy) to replace it before you lose the other three. If you lose all four, your character is deconstructed, you lose a ton of studs, but your character is reconstructed right on the spot.
Here, your character can have more than ten hearts, depending on how many Heart Upgrades you buy (see Jawas section). The catch is this: your enemies don’t often drop hearts upon defeat, and if you lose all hearts then you start from your last save point. This makes the game all that much harder.
The Boss Health Meters are different from that of the other versions. Rather than a row of hearts near the bottom of the screen, it is a band of red lines surrounding the feet of the Boss or Sub-Boss. Every hit costs a red line, and once all the red lines are gray, all it takes is one hit, and the Boss is defeated.

JAWAS
These brown Minifigs are all over the place, from Tatooine to Musafar. During the game, you collect Studs, and these greedy guys want it! So what do they do? They give you the option of purchasing items from them. Most of the time, the Jawas want to give you the following:
- Heart Upgrade (recharges your Health Meter and gives you an extra heart) for 50 Studs
- Stamina Upgrade (recharges your Stamina and extends the Lightsaber meter) for 50 Studs
- Repair Droid (if you die, this guy reconstructs you so you don’t have to start from the last save point) for 25 Studs
Although the Heart and Stamina Upgrades may seem tempting, I would suggest purchasing the Repair Droids instead. Or, even better, discover the cheat code that gives you Repair Droids for free (see Death Star Plans)!

DEATH STAR PLANS
There are no Minikits in the game. Instead, you will have 5 Death Star Plans hidden in every level. By finding all five in a level, you will have a large stud increase (see Ratings section) and it will give you a secret code that you can enter during the Pause Menu. Here are a few examples of cheats that you can find:
- Free Repair Droids: You get a Repair Droid for Free
- Play as Battle Droid: You play as a Battle Droid
- Play as C3-PO: You play as a C3-PO, an otherwise useless character
- Purple Lightsaber: Your Lightsaber or Blaster turns purple

RATINGS
After completing a level, you get a Jedi Rating, based on four things:
- Enemies deconstructed
- Studs collected
- Enemy Blaster Shots deflected with Lightsaber
- Death Star Plans collected
Based on how many of each you have, you will get a certain amount of Bonus Studs in addition to those you collected in the level. From the Bonus Points, your are given a Jedi Rating:
0-250 Bonus Studs: Padawan
250-500 Bonus Studs: Apprentice
500-800 Bonus Studs: Master

OVERALL
Although not nearly as good as the other versions, I would suggest getting this if you have a Game Boy Advance. If you have a Nintendo DS… wait for LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

-levels are boring 
-studs are worth much less 
-requires cheat codes 
-missing levels

"Generalstaal","2009-08-12T17:29:10.78Z","Pretty Bad","I got this game, because at that time, I only has a GBA, and I liked Lego, and Star Wars. It is Rubbish.
The levels completely different than the PS2 etc. version, the graphics is bad, Studs are worth diddly squat, there are only 3 levels in Episode II, and 5 in the other episodes, there are only 15 characters, but others are unlockable. With Cheat Codes! One of which is General Grievous, which is one of my favourite Minifigs. I was disappointed because: 1.He requires cheat code, 2.He only has 2 Lightsabers, and 3. His attacks are these random swaying of the lightsabers back and forth.

The only reason I gave this a 2 is because of one thing: The first mission of Episode II is Anakin, and the Tusken Raiders, which wasn't included on the main game on the Ps2
