"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-15T07:20:46Z","A new era for Lego software?","Looking at this from the stand point of a Lego fan, I think this game is a major milestone for Lego software, previous Lego games/software has seemed to have a relatively narrow field of appeal, certainly for anyone not obsessed by the little bricks of joy.  This on the other hand, thanks in no small part to the StarWars part of the equation, has very broad appeal, for kids young and old.
The game itself is great fun, you get to play as any of the characters I can remember from the first three films plus some from episode IV.  There's a two player 'mode' which just lets the second player join in whenever they want, so even kids and young as the age ratting, 3+ can get something out of it, by playing along with an older child.  There's lots of Lego bits which you can mess with, either by shooting them to make them blowup or using the force to manipulate them.

All the Lego vehicles and characters are modelled accurately and in detail, most being based on the StarWars kits.  There's a few models created specifically for the game, like the 'royal naboo starship' which given its shape is a Lego builders nightmare!  There appears to be little or no fudging of parts which just don't exist.

I saw my friend playing this on his X-Box and knew I would have to get it for my PS2. This game captures the spirit of the movies and makes me wish I had the Star Wars sets in my LEGO collection.

"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-01T14:43:08.81Z","Lego Star Wars: The Video Game!","I had simply run out of games on my Playstation 2 to play. But really that was inevitable because I only had three playstation games at the time. So, I went to a local warehouse and then, instead of heading towards the toy section, I looked for an affordable, preferably lego oriented gaming software for my Playstation. Luckily, I found this, and it was affordable. The only problem was, I didn't like Star Wars. There was much debate over whether or not to get this, as in the past I had merely ignored Star wars as I had considered it to be really lethal and violent, as the title suggests. It then occured to me that I had never before seen Star wars, and I might give it a go since I seem to enjoy the Sci-Fi genre. So, with a little reluctance, I bought this.

I always enjoy reading the instruction manuals and back of the disc holder on the way back home. As I was reading them, I became more and more eager to play it, despite the fact that I didn't seem to enjoy star wars. Complimenting every page with the word 'cool,' it was exciting to get home. After of course unloading the groceries, I finally started playing the game. 

What the instruction booklet will describe to you is this; There are 17 levels, throughout episodes I, II and III. In each level, there are several collectables, to make the game last longer. One colectable type is coins, which you can use to buy characters in the story and other unpractical things. When you collect a certain number of coins on each level you will acheive Jedi Status, which unlocks a bonus level once you complete every Jedi Status level. The coins you achieve from there are very secure once you have finished the level. You can then spend them on things at a place called Dexter's Diner, where you start off at and go to once you have done a level. 

Another unlockable is mighty things called 'minikits.' These are collected in canisters, 10 in each level. If you collect all ten in one level then it makes a mini star wars model, and you get 50,000 added to your collection of coins. 

The basic gameplay is really simple, to jump, you press X, to double jump you press square twice, to fire a blaster or slice something with lightsaber, you press square, which is reffered to as an action button. to change characters, you press triangle, and, if you are a protocol or astromech droid, you press O to activate a droid panel. There is also another function for O, which is only availible for jedi and sith. Find a glowing object. Then press O. this allows you to use the force. Jedi can also repel blaster fires back to the weilder, if you press square while holding a lightsabre you can repel a blast that is coming at you. To walk around you can use any basic steering control 

The actual levels of the game are quite good, and I there is only one I don't like, 'Retake Theed Palace' in episode I. The levels have two mode you can play in, free play or story. The latter you are forced to do at the start but once you complete it another level opens and you can play free play in the one that you completed story mode in. Free Play basically means that you can bring characters you have unlocked into the level by selecting them, and switch between characters that are not present by using R1 and R2. This is often really usefull as lego cleverly makes a challenge by forcing you to do really hard things with the characters that they force you to be.

Up in the top corner of the screen it says who you are, and if you are playing two player it says who both of you are. It also says how much coins you have and how much lives you have. The lives are simple. you start off with four hearts. You can lose one if you are hit by a weapon. If you lose all four you 'die,' but you do not restart. You just lose a few coins, really. once you regenerate you come back in the spot you died in, unless you fell off a cliff. In that case, you regenerate where you jumped off at. This does not happen in starfighters or podracers. If you lost all your hearts then you do start again where you last got up to. Also in vehicles if you crash you start again as well regardless of how many hearts you have. 

The controls for vehicles are much simpler, in a podracer you press X to speed up, and steer with any control. In a starfighter you use the basic steering controls but to start off with the controls are inverted. You can change this in the options menu. You can shoot using square.

In story mode you are entertained by a series of video clips which help explain the situation.   

The first level is called Negotiations, which is a tutorial level but still quite fun to smash up droids, and then you need to fight two droidekas at the end. The level ends by you hiding in an MTT.
The second level is called Invasion of Naboo, which is really self-explanatory. You have to navagate yourself around Naboo while avoiding droids. The level ends with you diving into a swamp. 
The third level is Mos Espa Podrace, where you get to go podracing! This is a really fun level you can play over and over again but you are timed, which makes it hard. What makes it more hard is the Tusken raiders shooting at you, and pushing boulders down the hill. Lucky for you, there are small strips of conveyor belts planted here and there for your convenience. All you have to do is run over them and you get a boost of speed. There is an annoying obstacle that Sebulba creates but I won't give everything away.
The fourth level is called Retake Theed Palace, which I dislike becuase it takes too long. apart from everything else it is alright, just slightly boring, especially collecting coins.
The last level in episode I is called Darth Maul, In which is quite enjoyable, as you get to fight with the force and execute a lightsaber duel, with Darth Maul. This level is very much like the movie.

Episode II begins strangly with Kamino. I'd have thought it would have started with Bounty Hunter Persuit. This episode is entitled Discovery on Kamino. It starts off with a nice video of Obi's red episode II starfighter coming out of a booster ring and entering the planet. The level is good and involves mainly chasing Jango Fett and then dodging bombs and in the end getting attacked by the Slave.
The next level is called Droid Factory, where you are Anakin and Padme in the Droid factory, getting attacked by genosians and trying to rescue obi-wan.
The next is really fun. Jedi Battle, where the most massive war in the game occurs. There was some confusion here as to what to do when I was doing it, and really you have to go around rescueing people and fighting droids and genosians. In the end you kill Jango Fett, which is not a graphic image becuase it is just lego bricks.
In the fourth it is your second chance for flying. It's called Gunship Cavalry. You get to fly aroung in a gunship destroying spider and hailfire droids and in the end you have to blow something up. The bad thing about that is that it is timed. 
The last in the episode is Count Dooku, where you mostly fight Count Dooku as Obi-Wan, Anakin and Yoda.

Episode III. My favourite. 
It is called Battle Over Coruscant. You start off as a Jedi Starfighter and you have to fly to Grievous's Flagship, dodging Vulture droids and Buzz Fighters. This is often fun.
The next is called Chancellor in Peril, which is really just carrying on from the previous episode. It's fun getting chased by the elevator. You mostly chase Grievous and kill Count Dooku and Grievous's Bodyguards. 
The next is General Grievous, where you kill Grievous with the assistance of Commander Cody while being Obi-Wan.
Next is Defence Of Kashyyyk, Where you are Yoda and fight clones and droids ending up in an escape pod exiled to Dagobah.
Second to lastly is Ruin Of The Jedi, where you are attacked by clones in the Jedi Temple. It's quite sad.
Lastly is Darth Vader. You got it. Fight with Anakin as Obi-Wan in Mustafar and end up killing him which is really hard. In the end is a clip of Darth Vader being angry.

Overall, a really good buy for your money. Hours of fun, even if you don't like star wars. At the present time I absolutely adore star wars, thanks to this video game. It introduced me to the genius world of star wars and I love it. If you get a chance, Buy this set! You will be amazed!

To access the levels, you use Dexters Diner, which will serve as youre base of operations throughout the game. This is where you access levels, view minikits and buy stuff. Also in each level there is a jedi bar. Basically, you have to collect a certain amount of coins in each level to get it.

"Ovid07","2008-03-30T13:44:36.42Z","This Game is Fun!","&lt;I have tried to condense this review, but being about a video game, it is rather large.  Because of that, this review contains SUBTITLES&gt;
INTRO
Before this game was released, Lego had a pretty bad reputation when it came to software.  When you bought a Lego video game, you generally would expect to find some cheap levels and a few collectibles thrown together with some cut scenes depicting Lego guys running around, for the most part looking like idiots.  However, then Lego Star Wars the video game came along, and Lego's standard for games was highly raised.  What was so different about this game?  It was fun.
INTRO (P.2)
I first played Lego Star wars the video game at a friend's house.  After playing through a couple levels, it hit me- this game is amazing! After many times playing it at my friend’s house, I knew I had to get the game.  The best part seemed to be that no matter when or how I played the game, it was always a fun- filled experience.
SET-UP
You begin the game in Dexter’s Dinner, a central Hub, which you explore to find levels (behind the episode I, II, and III doors).  In total there are 17 levels, which can be played in FREE PLAY mode, or REPLAY STORY.  Once you complete the first level, you can play the episodes in any order you want (ex. I1 - I2, I1 – II1).  This very handy, because it makes it hard to get stuck on one episode, and then not be able to play the other two. 
Replay Story- In this mode you follow the story of episodes I, II, and III.
Free Play- In this mode you play the levels without cut scenes, being any character you have unlocked in replay story, or purchased from Dexter.
When you complete a level, you end up back in Dexter’s Dinner.  
Not only can you use Dexter’s Dinner as a rest place in between levels, but you can also buy characters and extras from Dexter, using Lego STUDS, the game’s currency.  When ever you destroy an object, or complete a puzzle, you get a few studs.  Studs also determine whether or not you “beat the game”.  You see, if you collect a certain amount of studs in each level (signified by the Jedi meter), you will unlock the ? door in Dexter’s Dinner, and be treated to romping through the Tantive IV, as Darh Vader and a Storm Trooper.  
Another fun collectible that enhances replay value is the minikits.  In each level there are ten hidden canisters filled with Lego pieces to build a Star wars vehicle related to that level.  While you can not play as the vehicle, it is fun to watch your collection build up parked outside Dexter’s Dinner.
SET-UP (P.2)
	The levels are generally ten- thirty minutes long, and require you to kill enemies, solve puzzles, and get collectibles, along with finding your way to the end of the level.  If you happen to get hurt by an enemy, you will lose one of your four hearts (displayed up at the top of the screen, next to how many studs you’ve collected).  When all four are gone, your character will explode into pieces, and will lose some of the studs they collected.  This “death system”, along with the fact you can collect hearts just like studs adds to the player friendliness of the game
SET-UP (P.3)
	You always play the game with a second player.  If you aren’t playing with a friend, the computer will fill the position.  The al player will follow you around, attack enemies (but not kill them), help you complete puzzles, and activate panels/ switches that require two people.  If you want to play with a friend, all you have to do is plug in a second controller, and press start.  The second player will take the place of the computer, and ether of you can “drop out”, or “drop in” again at any time during the game.
STORY/CONTROLS
	Lego Star wars follows the story of episodes I, II, and III very closely.  Now, you’re probably thinking “How could a kid’s game portray some of the darkest moments in the Star wars series?”  They use humor!  As if little Lego guys running around isn’t funny enough, the cutseneces that tell the story range from Obi- Wan poking Anakin in the bottom with a light saber, to Jar Jar Binks sniffing flowers.
	The controls in Lego Star wars are very basic and common, with almost no learning curve.  EX- left analog stick= move x= jump, o= use force, triangle = tag another character, square= attack, shoulder buttons= change character in free play mode (PS2 version).
LOOK
Graphically, Lego Star wars is perhaps the most smooth and lush Lego game ever (with the exception of the other games built on its engine: Lego Star wars II the original trilogy, Lego Indiana Jones the original adventures, and Lego Batman the video game), with a high attention to detail.  This is partly because the whole environment isn’t made out of Legos.  This may come as a shocker to those who have played a Lego game before, but honestly it works out great.  If you really want to see what I’m talking about just take a quick glance at a screen shot of the game.  The animation is also first class.  During the cutsences, the Lego people don’t talk, so the story is told by their grunts, body launge, and the environment around them.  
	The camera is set at a 3rd person point of view, and because of the drop in – drop out co-op both characters are shown on the same screen.  The camera follows the characters very well changing view when needed.  The only problem seems to occur when the two characters are far away from each other.  The camera tries to correct the problem by zooming out, but after going so far, it has to stop resulting in the computer taking momentary control of one of the players.  However, this problem rarely happens, and is fixed in the sequel.
CHARATCERS/ DIFFICULTY
Lego Star wars has over thirty different characters, most of which are Jedi.  This is probably the worst part of the game, because the Jedi are the only ones able to build with Lego bricks.  Not only that, but the blaster characters can only shoot to defend them selves, and the laser fire is just deflected by the Jedi.  Blaster characters can grapple up walls and other obstructions, but only where certain red circles are averaging among 2-6 a level.  Droids would try to help, but they are only along to activate panels that open doors and turn on machines.
	Lego Star wars being billed as a kid’s game, isn’t very difficult.  However, that’s if you want to just run through the levels.  While that part might be easy, it dose take some skill to collect all the minikits, and get 100 percent of studs on all the levels.  And maybe that’s the best part of Lego Star wars, it is a game for all different ages and types of people.
OVERALL
Lego Star wars was truly a turning point for Lego.  No longer are Lego video games looked down upon and laughed at as a sad attempt for money, no.  Now Lego video games are looked at as award-winning, fun, adventures for the whole family. 9/10

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-11T18:14:42.887Z","Prequel Era Star Wars Mastered in Brick Form","<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game: This game introduced the world to the LEGO Video Game formula. Sure LEGO had produced other video games before this, but they hit an obvious gold mine when they teamed up with Lucasfilm and Traveler's Tales to produce the first in a series of blockbuster LEGO based video games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because this game is the first in a franchise it does have some noticeable flaws. For one thing I suspect that in order for this title to tie in with the big Revenge of the Sith marketing blitz they rushed things considerably. Some of the features of LEGO games would not be introduced until the sequel, so in this game you can't create your own unique characters, there aren't any bonus missions or play through the Prequel saga in one go with no stops. There are some noticeable lags in the frame rates at times and certain glitches... Forgive me if I forget to mention something I haven't been able to play this title in a very long time due to the fact that my PS2&nbsp;gave up on me and I have yet to find/pick up a replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This game did introduce the core mechanics and basic game play of the LEGO Games franchise. You can build, manipulate objects with the Force, play co-operatively with a friend, unlock a bevy of extras including numerous characters, impressive looking mini-kits and fun diversions such as mustache mode, or silhouettes. (I just know I spelled that wrong.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the game is short, shorter than it's sequel or even LEGO Batman. Many features were not implemented in time, such as the vehicle stage from Episode II (introduced in The Complete Saga) and the vehicle stages that were given were a far cry from what came later. But this game is still fun to play with, even if you can unlock everything and accomplish everything pretty much in a weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean this game is bad. Like any new franchise the LEGO Video Games required something of this caliber as a learning step. And the game is a relatively harmless diversion for any child (or any of us bigger children that want to see our mini-figures act in ways that they normally can't.) Do I recommend this title today, now that the much better Complete Saga is available? I can't seriously recommend this to anybody with possible exception to people who have this overwhelming urge to complete everything in a given LEGO Theme Collection. But back in the day when it was first available I'd have to say that this was a must own, can't fail video game. And without it, we wouldn't have the impressive titles that we have today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like all things LEGO Star Wars The Video Game is the forerunner for a franchise that has continued to hit strides with its learning curve after each consecutive title. I eagerly look forward to seeing what else LEGO, TT and any subsidiaries they choose cook up in the future of this franchise. LEGO Atlantis perhaps, or LEGO Space Police? Or perhaps&nbsp;a game based on the LEGO Studios franchise of the past? Or more than likely more and more Star Wars games... But that isn't altogether a bad thing.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,3
