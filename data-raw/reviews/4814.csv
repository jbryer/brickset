"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T19:22:37Z","Great Game","When I first heard about this game about a year ago, I thought it sounded like a good idea, but I never thought it would be much more than a gimmick.  Boy was I wrong.  Lego Star Wars, while not a very deep game, is extremely fun.  You play primarily as Obi-Wan or Anakin through out the game, but there a dozens of unlockable characters ranging from lowly battle droids to people like Jango-Fett and Darth Maul.  The game spans the three prequel movies The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.  And if you want to play this game but are worried about potential spoilers from Revenge of the Sith, dont be.  The spoilers are kept to a minimum.  There is only one glaring flaw in the game: the length.  The game is extremely short.  I beat it in the span of two days, each day playing for about three hours.  There are MANY unlockables though, ranging from the mundane (big weapons) to the insanely awsome (Darth Vader).  So this game would make a great rental, but being priced at forty dollars, if you want to purchase it, you'll be playing for awhile even after you beat it.  Oh, and this game really isnt only for kids.  I'm 16 years old and really enjoyed it, so if thats a concern of yours, let it go.  It's an all ages game.  So with that, I give Lego Star Wars an eight out of ten.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"surfersofthemind","2005-05-29T20:06:08Z","Fun and Challenging for all ages","We got this game for our son but my wife and I have had more fun playing it. It is not the hardest game around but does include plenty of challenges for the advanced gamer. To get 100% on most levels you have to go back and play it again with different characters as they all have different powers and weapons/tools. Most of the vehicles in the game are based on the actual Lego sets. The two-player option is great, you can join in at any time and drop out if you have had enough without interfering with the other player. 
Highly recommended!
As this game is based on episodes 1, 2 and 3 I hope they make a sequel with 4, 5 and 6, I would definitely get it!

Remember, the Force is with you...

"omgbrick","2007-08-08T13:39:38.05Z","The vehicle levels are...","Way to hard in my opinon it took for every to beat each of the three. Still the rest of the game play is great. You start out in dexters diner as obi wan and and his master there are four doors one for each movie and a bonus level. In each level you have to get through it buy solving any puzzles along with destroying enemys you can build things and use the force to build things also. In each level you try to get ten minikits which builds some vehicle if you get all ten for a level you get a 50000 studs  bonus. You also try to fill your jedi meter by collecting studs every time you get a full jedi meter you get a specail minikit. When you get them all it allows acsess too a bonus level in the  forth doorway. Though for most levels you have too go through them again in free play too get all the minikits or fill the jedi meter. As there are lot's places to only certain charecters can go. There are lots of random funny things thoughout the game. You can also buy extras and enemy charters at dexters diner. Again the only major problem was vehicle levels which were way to hard for me. Its a great game you will enjoy it alot if you get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-07-09T12:22:24.45Z","Yeah! A decent LEGO Game! ","This version is definitely a step up of the game boy version. Here are some things that they've improved on: 

Pros: 
-much better graphics and camera angle 
-a ton more characters 
-more rounds that are longer and much more fun 
-actual clips 
-studs are at there normal rate 
-no cheat code requirements 
-actual minikits 
-you start out in the diner 
-cool vehicle rounds 
-includes Kamino round 
-gunners are actually worth something 
 
Cons: 
-compared to the game boy version, none! 

Although there are still a couple of things that TT Games didn't add to the game that they could have, but did later, this game is still a great way to start them off!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
