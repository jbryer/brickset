"Gus_263","2008-02-24T12:30:16.763Z","Classic silver guy","This set have notable features, like the matoran body used as armor, and the nuva small armors in the arms. The mask is the same of dume, but with silver painting. The red pieces are very cool and rare in the 2005 year. The staff have a axe on the top, and he also haves the same shield of iruini in the silver colors and two spinners. These are silver and red. A great set,5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-01T01:54:55.797Z","Re-used mask with scruffy paint job","Norik does kind of look dodgy to me, so I'm going to go with the fact that he stole Turaga Dume's mask and gave it a scruffy silver paint job so people wouldn't recognise it. But anyone could see that it was Dume's. Now onto the sets pros and cons:

Pros:
Shield
Red Rhotuka
Nice chest plate
Old Toa Nuva shoulder pads
Gali Nuva's weapon used as spearhead
Vahki legs
Suuhkorak legs as arms
Swivel mechanism

Cons:
Turaga Dume's masak
Only one new Rhotuka colour

Overall Norik isn't as good as Iruini but is still worth getting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-09T10:28:37.347Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Toa Hagah) - Toa Norik Review","This is a very valuable set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we don't have to worry about stickers as well. The arms, the feet, the legs, the hands and the head can be moved and in one hand you'll a see a launcher which is able to shoot a spinner. We also get a second spinner which you can store in this launcher. The other arm has a cool looking staff. On the back of the torso you can see a gear which moves the arms up and down. I really like the armor of this figure as well. These Toa Hagah are really cool but I'm really disappointed that LEGO never made a toa version of Gaaki, Bomonga, Pouks and Kualus. This is a cool set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"vexorian","2009-12-24T07:45:36.077Z","Gali Nuva's weapon","I was able to get Norik and Iruini after finding them by luck buried under a stack of toys in offer.

I think that of the two Norik looks best. Unfortunately, it does not have as many unique parts. Silver is very common in bionicle sets.

Pros:
* Looks great.
* Launcher can be easily modified to just be a shield.

Cons:
* Gali Nuva's weapon. If the weapon was a little more unique this would have gotten 5, really.
* Comes with a launcher. This one is hard to aim and the disks keep falling off.
* Hard to get a pose other than the one in the can.
* If you want it for parts, it is not going to be as good as Iruini.

Overall, I think that if for some coincidence you can find Iruini or Norik you should really get them. If you only have money for one of them. I recommend Norik for looks and Iruini for parts.
