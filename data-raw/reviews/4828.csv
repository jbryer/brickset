Although I still feel 100 are too few, not a bad figure, especially there are too many Johnny Thunder faces already existed.  Great for arms buildup but otherwise useless.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-02T16:18:39.763Z","Minifigure","This set is a complete minifigure, with few pieces, being a shield, an axe, and a helmet with the normal parts of minifigures, the body, the head and the legs. These pieces are normal to normal minifigures, don't others like the old technic, bionicle and exo-force robots or in different shape like the aliens of mars mission. This minifigure is different in comparision with the other vladek minifigure, the helmet and the head have different designs, in the original the helmet looks like with his first action figure, and the head included in this set is from shadow knights, not fom the original vladek. In the pack shows that this set have five pieces, but if counting the hands, are seven. Altough this set have few pieces it is because is only a pack with only a minifigure, don't the original vladek, still useful for armies and it is cheap due to the size. The complete set is a minifigure and it's additions, like on ninja of the mini heroes collection, but this don't features a plate.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2010-09-07T21:33:07.15Z","G'day mates- err... oops! Wrong Theme!","<p>I received this set (along with the Jayko polybag and Knights Catapult) in a Brickmaster promo. Vladek (who appears to be Johnny Thunder in masquerade) is a simple polybag.</p>
<p>Building Experience: It's a minifigure, not much to expect.</p>
<p>Parts: So this is what Johnny Thunder did after <span style=""font-style: italic"">Adventurers </span>ended... joined the shadow knight corps. Obviously from the picture, you can tell that the designers (if they took time to design this promo) skimped on facial features. That's right. It's a good ol' Johnny Thunder. &quot;Vladek&quot; also features a hard to find (at the time) helmet and a very nice shield with the scorpion insignias.</p>
<p>Playability: This is one of those odd promos that people buy to build armies or complete a collection. This set has virtually no playability unless coupled with others (such as the other KKII sets).</p>
<p>Value for Money: Other than Brickmaster, I have no idea where this came from. It's a good set for $2-3, but definitely not worth the monthly Brickmaster $7 set.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts: If you miss this set, you're not missing much. This set I only recommend to completionists or KKII collectors. Is it worth it to add the original adventurer from down under to your Shadow Knight Army? You decide.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
"hustla187","2008-10-06T21:11:27.263Z","Not Right at All","Although this is a nice minifig, it is inaccurate to the regular Vladek figure. He should have a red sword and a different head so it doesn't look like Johnny Thunder in a costume. This is a pointless minifig but useful if only you are low on knights.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-06T13:33:11.937Z","Vladek Thunder?","Here Vladek has a Johnny Thunder head. He actualy has a face with rough facial hair and he looks more meaner while this one looks like he is smirking. Also he looks more like someone from Orient Expedition because of Johnny Thunder + uniform design and hat of Orient Expedition sets. The shield is nice, though.

"luckygingle123","2010-09-19T19:08:05.92Z","johnny thunder?","<p>thunder/vladek he looks to much like thunder seriously! he would look more like vladek if he had a blank head! Was this supposed to be in his younger times before he was a king? Really! But overall it is a good mini figure. OH and building experience is low because its only a mini figure you don't need building experience.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"tye","2019-08-25T16:05:33.467Z","Nice Army builder","<p>A Minifig polybag. Pretty much a collectible minifigure before they started doing collectible minifigures and you know what you were getting instead of mystery bag.</p>

<p>The one weird thing is that they gave Vladek a Johnny Thunder face for the polybag. But still worth to beef up your Shadow Knights.</p>

"legojoe343","2011-02-26T07:40:48.197Z","Vladek minifigure","<p>It is a good minifigure, but it has the same face as the <strong>""lego adventurers""</strong> <SPAN class=goog_qs-tidbit-0>leading man, <strong>""</strong><SPAN class=goog_qs-tidbit-0><strong>Johnny Thunder"" </strong>so it was weird to see that face on a lego knight. I`m not sure if this figure is ment to be a young <strong>""Vladek"" </strong>minifigure because in <strong>""Lego knight`s kingdom II""</strong>, the&nbsp;lego castle theme <strong>""Vladek""</strong> was in, he&nbsp;was a sort of bearded evil man with red eyes and in this figure he looks like a happy young man and</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=goog_qs-tidbit-0><SPAN class=goog_qs-tidbit-0>&nbsp;<strong>""Vladek"" </strong>is like the lord of evil or somthing like that! Apart from that it is a good figure. I can`t remmember where I got it from but I know it was promotional and there was also a <strong>""Jayko""</strong> minifigure who was another knight from <strong>""Lego knight`s kingdom II""</strong> and he looked like he was an older <strong>""Jayko""</strong> when the&nbsp;<strong>""vladek"" </strong>minifigure looked like a younger<strong> ""Vladek""</strong>, mabey it was because <strong>""Vladek""</strong> was old in <strong>""Lego&nbsp;knight`s kingdom II"" </strong>and <strong>""Jayko""</strong> was young. You could also get a cattapult that came with no minifigures. All the promotional sets were in pollybags, not boxes.&nbsp;Back&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>""Vladek""</strong> minifigure. It was not much to build because it was just a minifigure. It came with 6 parts, a body with a picture of a scorpian on it, black legs, a head, a black knight helmet, a axe and a shield.
