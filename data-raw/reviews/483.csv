On it's own it is not a big deal but it's great in combination with the others, although I only had 2 extra (1642 & 1646). The only thing I didn't like was, that the propeller didn't rotate as smoothly as it does on 1642. 

Following is a group review.

The group is made of sets 1642 through 1649 (Basic, '89). Take a look at the instructions of set (e.g.) 1647 to see what you can build with all 8 of them.

Except for propellers/wheels, the bricks aren't that specialized, but their just enough to fuel your imagination!

I highly recommend this for small kids!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
