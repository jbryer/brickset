<p>The&nbsp; special pieces you get are the expensive antenna and the yellow winch, the blue railroad tracks, white big doors, and maybe the white windows. The rest is just standard pieces, almost a a Basic set, but built with ingenuity.</p>

<p>The two minifigs are (for me) the main attraction, even if they are generic.</p>

<p>For me, it looks dated besides newer freight stations, but with gray tracks (or even 9V tracks), it doesn&#39;t look bad!</p>
