<br />
After Lego&#39;s attempts with Promotional MAERSK&nbsp;boats, this is actually the first complete Truck/Lorry with one of the two Semi trailers, way too big to fit to any other theme list at the time.<br />
<br />
The result though is what is left in our childhood dreams: The Ultimate Truck/Lorry Lego set for all vehicles lovers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s a league on its own set, determining the Era in which vehicles still use stickers for headlights instead of the latter released set (1552), using Transparent headlights 1x1 plates.</p>

<p>All the parts for both the short and the long containers are made in the beloved Old (light) Grey colour. Special and really rare parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Old Light Grey Windows 1x6x5.</li>
	<li>Old Light Grey Window 1x3x5 Shutters.</li>
	<li>Old Light Grey Bricks 1x3x5.</li>
	<li>Maersk Blue Doors (Left &amp; Right) 1x3x2.</li>
	<li>Maersk Blue Old Minifig Accessory Construction Helmet, Headgear.</li>
	<li>Eventually, all Maersk and Old Light Grey coloured parts..</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, the legendary sticker sheet&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.toysperiod.com/lego-set-reference/parts/sticker-sheets/1651.2stk01_sticker-for-set-16512-190775/"" title=""1651.2stk01 Sticker for Set 1651-2 - (190775)"">Sticker for Set 1651-2 - (190775)</a>..</p>

<p>I only wish they had even more ideas like this one at those days..</p>
