The suggested builds on the box look strange and there are only common pieces included. This set reminds me more of something I would build as a kid rather than a LEGO set that would be sold. There is not much playability other than there being a few pieces to build things. Overall, there is not much that is great and memorable about this set and it is not something that you should buy on the secondary market.</p>
