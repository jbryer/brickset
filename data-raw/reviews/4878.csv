I can repeat it another time, I like this kind of set.
Please Lego try again and again and I will buy it as long as I have money to spend.
Weer zo,n te gekke set van Lego, ik heb er net 3 binnen gekregen met de pakketdienst.
Mooie sets om aan mijn Santa Fe te hangen.
Lego ga zo door.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2005-05-23T07:40:40Z","Stacks of accuracy","This continues the theme of railroad (railway) sets based on actual prototypes. This makes up in to a fairly accurate replica of the cars (wagons) used for intermodal services in the U.S.A. where their generous loading gauge (unlike ours in the UK) allows the containers to be stacked on top of one another – hence the term ""stack train"". The cars are of the correct yellow colour and there are a few stickers to allow the TTX branding and weight stickers to be applied. Each set has 2 cars, which are authentically articulated on a central truck (bogie). From what I have seen, these often run in sets of 6 or more like this, but you have to draw the line somewhere. If you have more than one set you could possibly modify the cars to make up longer articulated sets. You also get one large and 3 smaller containers to make up with their own little freight stickers on the side. I guess using real names would have involved copyright issues. I would have also preferred on extra container so you could have a stack on both cars. My only criticism is that to fit in the wagons the containers they are only 4 studs wide whereas they would look better 2 studs wider, but this is just not possible within the Lego 6 stud wide loading gauge. These look really good behind the recently released 10131 modern BNSF loco – indeed this is how they are pictured on the box. I have also added an SD 40 – 2 by using parts from 2 x 10131 sets and a few additional parts. Overall this is a great set and I may well add more to my consist. I will certainly build my own additional containers. For accuracy and playability it rates a maximum score, as my reservations are only minor ones.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2007-09-27T17:44:53.013Z","Best LEGO rolling stock of 21st Century","When I got this set back in 2005 I was totally amazed at the quality of the model. The stacking system is AWESOME and the containers interlock to the classics. However, the 1x1 bricks with the extension thing lose the compatibility so you must replace that with a solid 1x1 brick.
