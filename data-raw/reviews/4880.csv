"Monty","2005-06-20T07:03:23Z","Awesome Leviathan","Having wished for a long time that Lego would release this iconic vehicle from Episode IV, I can tell you it was worth the wait. When I saw it recently posted as a new item on the Brickset site I was really hoping it would be out before the September release of the Death Star – and luckily it is. 

Although this is not a UCS set, it could almost be. Whilst it is not Minifig scale and not wholly accurate to prototype like UCS sets, it has much to commend it and it has become my favourite non UCS SW set relegating previous favourites the AT – AT and new Millennium Falcon into second and third places respectively. They could have made this using a framework with plates attached like the AT – AT and others, but chose to build up the box shape more conventionally brick on brick. The sheer number of pieces means that this will take a while to build. Whilst I enjoy long builds, making up the individual links for the 8 tracks and keeping count was a little tedious. 

From looking at the movie the thing is basically dark brown weathered with dust and rust and some lighter flecks. The colours on the box art look too gaudy – due to flash photography no doubt. The good news is in reality the greys used are for the most part the dark variety. I did feel the sand coloured bricks were out of place and modified mine during construction replacing them with browns and blacks or dark greys – I am pleased with the overall result. Another modification was the removal of the grey arch bricks from the front side openings and a reduction in their overall height to be more authentic. A final modification was the addition of a sloping under skirt between the tracked bogies – which is where the ramp comes down from in the movie.

The thing I really like about this set is the playability. The front ramp works and there is a central removable robot repair workshop which is equipped with computers and tools etc. There are also removable top hatches, which enable the crane to be mounted on the roof for lifting droids in and out through another removable roof hatch. The crane can also be stowed inside through the front ramp opening. There is an opening cockpit hatch which reveals allows one of the Jawas to be placed in side as the driver. A rack and pinion steering mechanism allows steering via the rear tracked bogies, although in practice it is a little difficult to steer and push with the small turn wheel on the rear. I should mention here that the detailed rear is my favourite part of the model.

Minifigs – well this has 12 including a bevy of droids - R2 D2, C3 PO, R1 G4, Treadwell Droid, Gonk Droid, ASP Droid, R5 D4, 3 x Jawas and a flesh coloured Uncle Owen – A flesh coloured Luke would have been nice to complete the scene so I have substituted a yellow one. I don’t really mind the flesh coloured ones, but it would be nice to have them match.

Oh yeah there are only 5 stickers – 3 for the cockpit windows and 2 for the equipment in the workshop.

When made up the set is huge, so ensure you have adequate storage/display space. I think this set has just about everything - it is enjoyable to build, great to look at and has plenty of minifigs with great playability. It has to be a must for all SW fans who can afford it - 110 GBP, but I think it is worth it, and it definitely rates a maximum score.

The best thing about it is the minifigures 12 in total.  It probably needed a Luke as well but thats only a minor thing.  The detail is great and the size impressive (it took me a couple of hours to build).  The floor of the inside is a bit fragile however so makes putting the droids inside a bit tricky and it took me ages to get the axle right for the rear wheels.

Well not all sets, but no doubt this set is a classic in the same league of the older OT sets like the Jabba's Sailbarge.

Most number of the parts are attributed to the amount of track pieces. You will encounter lots of pieces in reddish brown and earth orange, which will send some collectors over the moon. As mentioned, building the Sandcrawler is long drawn: first you build the base, then the walls in sections, the&nbsp;incredibly greebled rear panel and&nbsp;the 4 tracks.

Of course the Jawas are the star of the whole show. I sometimes wonder if the&nbsp;desirability&nbsp;and value of this set has anything to do with the current price of the Jawa minifig.

"Starstreak","2009-08-11T05:26:24.437Z","Looks real, but a bit off on proportions and fragile","I did a full review here with photos:
http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=29246


Here is the closing of that review:

Features
This set has many features. This is a set that can be considered a UCS made for playing. It has a middle section that is removable so you can play in the Sandcrawler and in the removable workshop. The front opens like the movie, there is a working crane to lift up the droids the Jawas steal, I mean find in the sand. The crane stand can also be placed on the top of the workshop to lift the droids up to the top of the Sandcrawler and dropped into the loading hole. There's a total of 5 droids to play with plus R2-D2, C-3PO, Uncle Ben, and 3 Jawas. I wish they included Luke. The tracks on the Sandcrawler can move using a rotation knob on the back of the Sandcrawler.

Not to many ""rare"" parts. Uncle Ben and Jawas are the only minifigs I can think of that you can't get elsewhere. <Whap!> Ouch! I was reminded that this whole thing is rare parts bin. Anybody looking for any brown parts will have a fun time. From the half-drums (brown) to all the ""L"" and 2x2 brown colored pieces. Pretty much if you want brown, this is THE set to get.  

My rating:
Playability: 4 out of 5. Everything about this is for playing. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 is that it WILL BREAK EASILY! There's only a single row of studs holding some of the floor plates in the Sandcrawler. 
Design: 3 out of 5. I'm being picky about this. The unit isn't to any scale. The inside of the Sandcrawler is nothing like the movie. There was no crane. Where's the suction tube that sucked R2 into the Sandcrawler? Why are there doors on the side with no doors?? I guess if they tried to make it to scale, the whole unit would be another 50% larger. Which would make it way too expensive. 
Build experience: 4 out of 5. It's not hard to build. But it is fragile when putting it together. It's like trying to build a house out of Lego. All the sides are mostly single stud wide for the walls. I'm sure a few choice blaster shots from a imperial canon could put holes into this Sandcrawler.  
Overall: 4 out of 5. Get it on sale. I paid around the $135 for it. Considering 1600+ pieces for a Star Wars set, it's a good value.

"AFOSL","2009-05-02T20:30:45.03Z","All Brick, All Of The Time!","This set was quite a breath of fresh air.  After building several kits based on Technic skeletons dressed in plates, a technique that Lego seem to be doing a lot, it was nice to build a larger model with hardly a Technic brick in sight.  Infact, the whole model is very old fashioned in design.  Simple bricks abound, with very few of the more modern, fancy, shaped pieces seen in other models introduced during the 2002/3 line up.  If it wasn't for just a few tell tale signs, notably  stickers, sloped bricks on the back (Peeron 44675), and to the keen eyed modeller, the colour palette, you would swear this model predates 2002.  It almost begs the question, ""why wasn't this model released sooner?""  The new sloped bricks could have been easily substituted for something else, the stickers could have been printed bricks, as per all Star Wars models in the earlier years and the slight changes made to the Lego colour palette in recent years have no real significance to the looks of a model.
Better late than never, I guess.  2005 release it was, and not a moment too soon.

As previously mentioned, this model is based on true bricks.  All vertical walls are brick work. 1x1's, 2x1's, 4x1's, 4x4's and many others are included én mass.
Brick upon brick is laid in order to acheive the scaling heights of the Sandcrawler.  There is no Technic frame behind the walls, and no plates to cover it.  
The front section of the vehicle is hinged allowing Lego move the front walls inwards to give the model it's distinctive Sandcrawler shape.  The nose of the vehicle consists of a cockpit perched high upon a ramp which opens to reveal the inside, containing a removable crane.  
The cockpit has a hatch on top which opens, allowing you to place a figure inside.  Unfortunately the figure will be staring at walls throughout the journey as no window pieces are provided.  What you get instead, are three stickers to place on the outside to create a window effect.  Why these window effects couldn't be painted on to specially matrked bricks, I don't know.  Time will tell as to how well these stickers fair, but going by experience, I know that stickers often deteriorate sooner or later.

The middle section of the model is removable and house a sort of workshop where Jawas can tinker all day, prepping droids for sale.  This workshop also has a removable roof, allowing the user to reach inside from all angles.  
The model has arched doorways either side, towards the front.  Although they are present in the actually Sandcrawler in the movies, they are barely noticable and could have proabbly been made smaller or even omitted from this model without sacrificing it's looks or playability.
The roof and the rear of the model have not been ignored and both pose great attention to surface detail.  The rear of the vehicle, in particular, is very impressives, using half cylinder pieces, slopes, plates and various other pieces to portay a working power plant needed to drive the Sandcrawler.

That power is then transmitted to the tracks.  This is where the build of the model slows down.  There are eight individual tracks to assemble for four drive train units.  The assembly of these units is practically identical and the repitition can be annoying.  But it needs to be done if you want to complete the model.
The main difference is between front and rear units.  Whereas the front units are fixed in a head on direction, the rears are instead mounted on a vertical spindle, attached to a rack and pinion mechanism inside, which connects to a horizontal shaft, passing through the rear of the vehicle, with a gear piece on the end.  This allows you to steer the rear tracks and guide the crawler where you want it.
It is in this steering mechanism where you will find the bulk of the Technic pieces.  The build of the tracks is sturdy, but their mountings are not.  The build can be a bit fiddly as the base of the vehicle at this stage can easily fall apart and it is this base that the drive train hangs off.  Once the Sandcrawler is built, the whole structure is pretty rigid, but it is heavy, so make sure you pick it up correctly or you may find more than 1600 pieces of Lego scattered over your floor.

There are a number of minifigures included with this set, including the all new Jawas and Owen Lars, Luke's uncle.  Luke is not included, which is surprising, seeing as he is in the scene involving the buying of the droids.  Speaking of droids, 3P0 and R2 D2are included, alongside a handful of others, including a Gonk droid, ASP droid and a Treadwell droid.  The R2 unit whose motivator blows is also included.
The Jawas are a nice touch and a long overdue minifig, making the Sandcrawler set worth having all the more.  My only real complaint is that they are a bit light in number.  Three just isn't enough.

The Sandcrawler is an excellent addition to the Lego Star Wars line up.  Long overdue?  Yes.  Worth the wait?  Definately!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Commander_Jaller","2009-11-11T10:53:04.75Z","LEGO's biggest brown machine!","This is a great set, and includes lots of minifigures, including many droids!
You can detach a hatch on top to look inside the workshop! The workshop includes some machinery, and many dark-gray colored tools.
Sadly there's a stickered piece in there...
Some of the tools are held by tan fences.

This set has tons of greebles and nice stuff, such as grills, pipes and other things, especially on top of the Sandcrawler.
This set is very unstable at first, but this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! to do; pick some big (and also small ones) plates out of your collection, place them inside on the floor very carefully, make sure not to break it down by accident, and voila, it's sturdy! (atleast, for me...)

I was surprised when I saw that my version included the newer C-3PO from the 10188 Death Star playset. It is alot better than the old 3PO, if only it was chrome. But that would never happen of course.. This means that the later versions of the Sandcrawler includes a pearl gold C-3PO. Other minifigs are Luke's uncle, by the name of Owen Lars, C-3PO as mentioned before, R2-D2, 3 Jawa's which are exclusive to this set, Gonk Droid, Treadwell Droid, and some more droids. For the Jawas there are three ""stunblaster"" pieces.

You can move the big wheels around with a cog piece on the back. The front ""door"" is very large, you can pull it down and look inside. Another hatch on top, smaller than the other, can be put off aswell to look inside. It has some interesting greebles on it. The Sandcrawler wouldn't look realistic with only a brown color, so it is great that there is burnt orange, tan, gray and even black pieces added to the outerior. It also has a crane, and the bigger hatch can be replaced with it. If it is on top of the crawler, you can pull off the small hatch, put it away, and put a droid inside (also with use of the crane), nice playability there. To have the crane hold a droid you have to put the piece, which also is on the small hatch, on for example R2-D2's head and then have the crane hold it.

Now the cockpit. You can open up the hatch, and put a Jawa in. The only controls here are two levers and a panel. Strangely there actually are two trans-yellow pieces as a window inside there, but on the outside there are THREE stickers to represent the windows. Oh well, still very nice.

Wow, that was alot of writing, so let's get on with the pros and cons!

PROS:
-Jawa minifigs
-Droids and Owen Lars
-Hatches detachable
-Nice looking crane
-Workshop with many tools
-Lots of greebles
-Very accurate design

CONS:
-No Luke minifig
-Stickered pieces
-Treadwell Droid needed binocular ""head""

OVERALL:
This is an amazing Star Wars set, and if you are lucky enough to see it somewhere and can afford it, I recommend you to pick it up, even if only for the parts! I give this set a 10 out of 10!

<p>After I was done, I was in awe.&nbsp; The set is HUGE, and looks great.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like it is&nbsp;really&nbsp; a little worn down a bit, and looks like it belongs in the sand.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability is great. The wheels move smoothly on any surface, and the crane works great, especially from the top of the Sandcrawler.&nbsp;&nbsp;The front door opens and your can take the crane out from there.&nbsp; The control center looks really neat, and there is a space for 1 Jawa in there.&nbsp; Other minifigures can go in the middle, which you can see into, and its like another little control area with a bunch of tools.&nbsp; Everything is just fun and awesome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minifigures are awesome.&nbsp; It comes with 3 Jawas, (but could come with another), a trash droid, Treadwell Droid (oober cool), an droid similiar to R2, a caretaker droid, a Gonk droid (looks like a mailbx with feet, Uncle Owen, R2-D2, and C-3P0, the two best droids EVAR!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price was very nice.&nbsp; It was $100 for 1,600 pieces, so compared to the sets today, it was a great deal.&nbsp; Also, $100 may seem a little high, but it was well worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jawa Sandcrawler: one of the greatest sets of all time.&nbsp; There is no flaws, and it is well worth the price.&nbsp; If the is anything to add, there should have been the landspeeder, Luke, and another Jawa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, easily the best set of my collection.&nbsp; Teehee!&nbsp; :D</p>

<p>Details are well covered.</p>

<p>-more mechanical parts (i.e. door opened by wheel)</p>
