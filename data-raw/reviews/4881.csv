It fits like a glove on my wrist and the mini-fig of Lord Jayko is awesome! To myself, I have a rare mini-fig from a discontinued LEGO system!

Pros

The best watch I ever owned
SUPER-COOL Mini-fig

Cons

It would be cool if they also added in a little play scene for the mini-figure.

Overall, I will want to keep this LEGO watch forever!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AndreasL","2010-06-14T20:39:46.373Z","Alternative Fantasy Era version review","<p>Notice, that this watch exists in an updated 2009 revision which has the same product number (4250349). The new revision has a Castle fantasy era&nbsp;theme. It&nbsp;can be seen on Bricklink at <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?G=2907CAS1"">http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?G=2907CAS1</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The color scheme of the fantasy era version is the same as the Knight's Kingdom version which may be why Lego kept the product number the same. However, the background image&nbsp;of the watch has been&nbsp;changed to&nbsp;showing a Castle king holding a golden sword. Also, the new revision comes with a very nice Castle knight with sword and shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The watch works the same as other similar Lego watches. It does not feel very sturdy but it works fine and is easy to adjust - both setting the time and making it fit the arm of a child (or adult).</p>
