<p>You&#39;re unlikely to find this set in the local Argos, but&nbsp;if you have young children and want to introduce them to basic engineering principles (gears, pulleys and levers etc)&nbsp;this is a fabulous set and really worth tracking down. There is a smaller set, #9652 which is also worth sourcing and increases the numbers of&nbsp;gears and axles etc.</p>

<p>The parts selection is superb and feel wonderful to handle and assemble. The large yellow gears are about 5.5 Duplo&nbsp;studs in dia. so are incredibly robust and safe to handle. A particular highlight is the worm drive and housing which is brilliant for using in mobile crane type constructions.</p>

<p>Of course the price of this set is a bit eye-watering. My advice, occasionally check the usually online auction sites&nbsp;(or create a search notification)&nbsp;as unopened sets&nbsp;do come up every now and then from bankrupt-stock type retailers.</p>

<p>The set also comes with a set of idea cards to inspire curious young minds and are a welcome addition. Of course using with and adding play-value to &#39;standard&#39; Duplo&nbsp;bricks is where it&#39;s at....</p>

<p>Highly recommended...Now, who wants a&nbsp;Massive hand-cranked windmill!??!!</p>

<p>PS: did you know a r/c Duplo&nbsp;motor is available? Let your&nbsp;imagination run wild!</p>
