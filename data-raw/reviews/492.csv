Nevertheless when I got this set in 2002, I was surprised to find it neither 
included in the internet data bases nor mentioned on any website.
This ferry is very similar to set 1656. It´s a model of the Viking Line ferries
""Viking Saga"" and ""Viking Song"", which are no longer part of the Swedish-Finnish
Viking Line fleet today.
Though most of the windows are printed on the bricks, this set comes with the 
unbelieveable number of 21 stickers, plus 2 for the alternate ship´s name. So it 
will be very hard for collectors to get it complete.
A 4x4 sticker for a heliport on top of the ship and a sticker for the stern door 
are particularly worth mentioning. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
