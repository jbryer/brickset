Also I think almost all minifigures should really be justified by some bricks or a mini build.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>The classic buttoned blue shirted and jeans clad workman in a red hard hat.</li></ul>You want a work uniform? Then you will possibly need Dave. Next is a bloke who l<b><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">ooks just like Dave but is probably called Ray. After that, t</span></b><b><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">he spitting image of Ray but he might be called Mike. Or is it Steve? M</span></b><b><span style=""font-weight: normal; "">aybe this chap is Steve, they wear the same uniform as it happens.</span></b></div><div><br><div><b>Army Ants</b></div><div>Like an unstoppable army of loading, building and demolishing clones these&nbsp;workers are apparently available in twenty one sets. Many similar kin expanded their variety in Construction but they are also heavily used as Railway workers. Tools were never far away from the blue shirts and this lot get four identical pick axes, ready to turf up the ground. The blue shirt remains a brilliantly simple top and it was great to rarely see a foreman or hi-viz top in sight though the old hi-viz tabard was snazzy as could be.</div></div><div><br></div><div>There's not much more to say other than that this army of one many dozers&nbsp;are so iconic to the Town theme, its well worth throwing a few around any modern townscape 20th century onwards to make things lively and busy. Laying long bricks two by two (jenga style) in to towers always seemed to suit them well crawling all over any structure like ants. Happy days.</div>",TRUE,4,5,2,5,3
