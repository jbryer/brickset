I like this, since it is much more accurate in terms of minifig scale, and gives more opportunity for the designers to be creative.

LEGO did a nice job by designing two race cars which look like they belong together, yet are so different. The front sides are similar, but the back sides are completely different, both showing different ways to build an engine and a rear wing. The black and yellow car shows a clever use of the snow plow piece as rear wing, which is adjustable in height as well.

However I personally feel the design could be better, in particular the cars should have side pods to make it look more like formula type race cars. The cars are already 6 studs wide, so implementing those side pods could not have been much trouble for the designers. But of course, since it is LEGO, you can do that yourself!

Overall this is a good, small-to-medium sized set. 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
