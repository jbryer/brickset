<br />
The Brick Vac really does help cleanup Legos quicker, but only small pieces like the ones included in the set. Sometimes longer or bulkier pieces can clog it up and it doesn&#39;t always get tiny pieces. Basically it just scoops pieces into the container as the wheel moves along the floor. Not ideal for storage because pieces can fall back out through the weel.<br />
<br />
The included brick separator is a big plus and has been a great tool for me through many years.</p>

	This brick vac is pretty cool looking, I have one thats different to the picture above, mine has a chicken sticker on the side instead. In my opinion this vacuum can pick up a bit at a time but if you put too many bricks and try picking it up, the turnstile stops and doesn&#39;t pick them up (especially the big bricks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Picks up little bricks quickly&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Looks cool</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Doesn&#39;t pick up larger bricks if you try to suck a lot of them at once,the turnstile gets jammed</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Overall:it is value for money (I got mine of eBay for &pound;18) and it picks up some big bricks but especially the little ones really quickly and in my opinion if you can get one for a good price get it.</p>
