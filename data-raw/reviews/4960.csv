Some tools for the men, a few windows and a yellow door. Even has some decent sized plate parts, and a few roof pieces too. By far the best ten dollar tub I have ever seen! The basic color blocks are here a black, yellow, blue and red. If you ever find this tub (complete) buy it! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Now I have hundreds of thousands of legos but this started me.  If you can find it get it because it is fun to use.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zacherano","2009-08-09T17:07:22.64Z","First Set and Still Building","     I will never forget this particular red Lego box - in fact, it is still sitting in my family's rec room in the center of my Lego collection!  This was my first Lego set ever.  I received this box nine years ago from my parents, and I still remember having so much fun building with it that I kept asking for and buying Lego.  
     I have progressed so much since then, but I think that if I had not ever recieved this set, I might never have started building Legos, until shortly after, when these small plastic bricks became one of my chief hobbies.  I am filled with passion at memories of this set.  From building houses and cars with this set sprung the creation of much larger, more complicated modular buildings such as Green Grocer, Town Plan, Medieval Village, and even Death Star!  
     In regard to storing your collection, here is my advice: when you take apart a set after it is on display (or just if you build it and decide to put it away for a while), bag it up, label the bag, and keep all your set bags of each theme and all instructions in one place.  Although I did not originally use this system, when I started doing it, it made it much easier to keep control of my Lego collection (as opposed to sticking the still-together sets into a big box, which I did with some of my original Harry Potter sets, or just taking all the sets apart and jumbling the pieces together in a box, which makes it very hard to reproduce the original sets again - I have done that before as well).  I hope this review inspires future generations of Lego builders, or at least brings back memories for seasoned Lego builders.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Hylocera","2010-05-08T20:30:13.607Z","MAX HAPPINESS!","<p>&nbsp;As the rating and the title indicates, this was an amazing set (more like bucket). It was ""cool, vibrant, and hard to find"" (Hobowrath-Inside Halo 3 Covenant Weapons). The playability was stunning, and I would create and demolish over and over again. LEGO was smart in choosing which pieces to put in this set, and the minifigures were cool. Now, back to the pieces. There were a pair of large red windows, two cool minifigures, bricks with eyes that could be turned to the wall for use as regular bricks, a couple yellow chairs, a green baseplate, and a hammer paired with a wrench.</p>
<p>As for the playability, the bucket had 400 pieces of it, and the pictures on three sides of the bucket added some ideas. The variety of pieces made it easier to create stuff, and there were no limits to the kind of things you could make.</p>
<p>The value for money, ah... Well, I didn't really notice the tag, but even for $99.99 <em>I'd</em> get it, though $149.99 is a little extreme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, overall, 10/5, and if I had gotten one of those deluxe things that were around then, 20/5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
