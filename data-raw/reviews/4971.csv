"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-24T18:58:39.633Z","The reason I am a LEGO fan.","This was my very first LEGO set. Ever. I can remember being a little kid and building houses, cars, bases....<div><br></div><div>and this set has a pretty good building experience. I mean, it's a brick bucket. No instructions, no limits, nothing. You could build a car repair shop. Or a house. A car. A base. Anything. And you get this little minifigure (who sits on my desk right now) with black shades and a green jacket.</div><div><br></div><div>Because of the limitless possibilities for building, there's also unlimited playability! Has the car broken down? Is there a hurricane? Are the bad guys bombing you? Whatever! The set has so much play it's ridiculous!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Not to mention this set does have some neat pieces too, such as a blue slope with stars (useful for building racecars) and transparent pieces.</div><div><br></div><div>Now my final word is that this set just rocks. It was my gateway into LEGO and I love it so much. Bless you set 4810. Bless you.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legodude357","2011-02-25T09:03:14.66Z","My first Lego set.","<p>Like another reviewer on here, this was my first set. I remember when I was very young, 2 or 3, my dad gave me this and I rememeber buying countless Lego starwars sets like Jedi defense one and what not to fill it with. I built capital ships and such for my Obiwan and Qui-gon figures. I kinda wish I still had this set today. This started my Lego career and I've never quit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts</p>
<p>A minifigure, bricks, and a few specialtly peices. All for a great price. What more could ya want? I wouldn't go out of my way to buy one of these, but let me tell you. It is a great set to store your lego sets and such in. Highly reccomended for someone you want to get started in lego. Just remeber to buy more sets for it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minifigure</p>
<p>I used him as a hostage taken by the droids&nbsp;a lot. He's pretty basic but plays a huge role in this set. Without minifigures, lego creations and houses wouldn't be playable. Mocs would be extremely bland. And this little dude teaches that to the new Lego fan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, again, highly reccomend this for someone new to lego, or someone who you want to get interested in Legos. Its still pretty cheap, I just saw one on ebay for $19.99. I had hours upon hours of enjoyment from it. But (yes again) remember to keep buying more sets to put in it. I would reccomend this to a friend! Thanks for reading!</p>
