The Cyborg Scout has a blue alien (a robotic style alien), a land vehicle with 3 large barrel wheels, and that's about it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Fauch","2014-11-29T00:02:38.78Z","Nice design","<p><font face=""Rockwell"">Also it comes with a few nice pieces, 3 big black wheels, some trans green pieces, 2 &quot;guns&quot; (a camera with studs on 4 sides and a piece which was used as a torch in old castle sets) as well as a printed tile with a control panel.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Rockwell"">The minifig was very good for 1997, all parts are printed (even legs) and the design is really intricate. No back printing.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Rockwell"">This site suggests the price was 3$. This seems low. Nice price if it was the case.</font></p>
