<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, this was/is a really good Value Pack as it offers up a miniset for series 1 Blacktron with the black uniform, helmet and visor. And it's a fairly decent little ship the minifigure comes with to fly around in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second set to this is one a wagon set featuring one of my favorites, the Foresters. As someone going after all the Forester sets I could, this was a must have. 2 Forester Minifigures, a wagon with a hidden spot underneath for a minifig to hide in, horse and hay bales. There's even a saddle and white fill in spot for the horse should you want to do other things with the horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third set is a bulldozer with 2 construction worker minifigures. It's red instead of a classic yellow like so many other Construction sets, but that's alright. It still adds nicely to a town set and helps to flesh out a sparse construction theme or add variety to a Town/City setting and what's going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;Pack rather pleased me and I've enjoyed it very much over the years.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
