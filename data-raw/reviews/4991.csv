For 650 pieces, this was a steal.  The bucket contains many basic bricks, including 1x1 bricks, and a generous amount of green 3 stud long roof shingles, as well as some bushes, vines, flowers, inverted slope bricks, 2 different shapes of white fence pieces, and 3 minifigs.  If you can ignore the &quot;smiley face&quot; and &quot;eye&quot; bricks, you can build a variety of houses.  It includes 2 red doors and 4 windows with shutters too.  

I took a point off for things like the color of the 2 small baseplates - yellow.  Unless you're pretending to build on sand, I don't think yellow is a good color for baseplates.  I would have much preferred green.  Also, the axles and tires are too large for this set.  The smaller wheels and tires would be more to scale for the minifigs.  

I can see a child or even an AFOL having hours of fun with this set.
