"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-01-15T23:45:02.95Z","Perfect example of FreeStyle.","<p>I got this set all the way back in 1997 as a Christmas present. I was not wholly new to building with full-on Legos, but the ones I played with were my father&#39;s (though he has long since let them pass to my siblings and I) and not my own - all I had to my name was Duplos (I <em>had</em> received a tub of Legos for my birthday once but it got left at my grandparents&#39; during a move earlier in &#39;97 and sadly most of it was donated to a thrift store). Besides which, my father&#39;s piece collection had some definite lacks as far as some honestly basic parts went.</p>

<p>I still have most of the pieces from this bucket (though some are in need of repair because I did not take good care of them), and they continue to serve me well as a builder.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a handy red medium-size Lego storage bucket, with four studs on top. These studs are the same size as those on the Lego drink/storage cups you get at Lego Land parks and Lego Stores, so there&#39;s a bit of building fun to be had. There are some nice pictures of potential models on the side stickers, as well as a handy inventory sheet. These features are duplicated on the folded pamphlet included.</p>

<p>The instructions... are nonexistent. The theme is called FreeStyle for a reason. There is no set model the parts are supposed to build (Heh, they should&#39;ve just thrown this theme at Business -it would&#39;ve given him an anyeurism), so even if you&#39;re the type that prefers to keep at least some sets together, these are free for any use you can dream up.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a beautiful selection of pieces available in this set. There&#39;s your basic bricks and plates, as well as wheels and flagpoles and a variety of accessories (including a helmet with a visor - always fun to open and close the visor, it really is), windows with shutters and opening casements, hinges (including a 2x5 hinge plate), chairs, supports, a bush, various bits and bobs, and even a 16x16 baseplate.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Timmy and the professor from Time Cruisers are included in this set, though the prof has ditched his more professional duds for casual wear (including a FreeStyle shirt).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build consists of you putting the pieces to work however you see fit. There&#39;s so many ways to use them. The only limit is that you might not have enough parts for a particular ambition.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Not really applicable for this theme. The completed model or models plural is entirely up to the builder.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A set people only want to buy for parts has kinda failed as a set. This, however, is not a set - it&#39;s a bucket of parts that aims to broaden your building horizons and very much succeeds. With 320 pieces and of such variety, there is a good bit you can do. Very good value for a mere ten dollars, and almost perfect as a way to introduce a child to the full Lego building experience (I say almost because by itself it might run out of bricks if they want to build something like, say, a larger house - it&#39;d be perfect if accompanied by a basic bricks bucket). If you can find one for a decent price, it would actually still be worth picking up today (though perhaps not with the bucket, if only for what it might do to the shipping cost).</p>
