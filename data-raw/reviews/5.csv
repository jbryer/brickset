But in my word these changes don't do anything because you can't see them. So it's that I'll give it 10. But if I could see them, I'll give it a 9.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Not as good as good as the original club car box, though... PIECES: 10/10 - Great pieces and if this was 4547, the first set to use the double decker plate. PLAYABILITY: 10/10 - I really like the opening roof of the train. The sleeping compartments looks really good. It looks good alone, or with the Metroliner.
