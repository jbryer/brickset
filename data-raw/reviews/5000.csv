What is interesting is that the base plates are built in to the table, and trust me, it is impossible to get it out. Terrible. Do not get this set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"dragonlord710","2008-10-10T15:00:46.543Z","Laptop LEGO","   This set has two half 25X25 cm base-plates that slide together into the middle forming one 25X25 cm base-plate, and can be removed by pulling the base-plates up while sliding into the middle. On either side of the base-plates are containers for holding LEGO. This set comes with two LEGO figures, but they are not the standard minifigs, they are the ones designed for younger children. 
   I rarely use this set for its real purpose but the base-plates were very useful.
