"knuclear200x","2009-11-09T23:10:16.17Z","The first LEGO (aka First and only DUPLO) I've ever owned","I'm not sure why we never opened this a long time ago, as it hid in the closet's upper shelf in my bedroom for some undisclosed amount of time, but when I discovered it in there I humbly requested that it be brought before me to be built  right away.

It was just a simple train set complete with straight and curved tracks, but I too was simple and played the dang thing for hours. My sister was underage at the time, but back then I already believed that age was just a number and we played together as we shared the ""great wonder"" with all the other toys in my toy box.

The Train set consisted of the main engine, passenger car, and a teetering animal transporter each connected by peg and hook. The main car also had those uh...train wheel things that connect to make...the wheels move or whatever I dunno what those dang steel rods are called on train I aint no train mechanic guy why do I have to know these sorts of....uh...and is driven buy a male conductor figure. And to be placed in the middle of the connected tracks would be the train station. It also comes with a female passenger who has strangely packed her suitcases in a box for some reason. Yeah, instead of suitcases, a service phone and a mailbag are blocks that have pictures of suitcases, a service phone and a mailbag on each one. A recurring theme for the safety of our young, pre-LEGO enthusiasts.

Aaaand the lamb, who rides in the teetering animal carrier. Which I believe is against the standards of proper animal transportation of all rail systems...I mean...for lamb-rocking fun as you move the train across the tracks or off of the tracks. Oh wait that's actually for the mailbag brick. There is a yellow, empty crate brick for the sheep but the sheep can ride in the former if you want it too.

Placed in the middle of the tracks is the train station. It's not too small but it has enough room for some chairs, the phone brick, and an oval block with a clock in it to tell time...the same time. Just remember and check it constantly, as the train will arrive at 10:08, then depart at 10:08, and expect any delays due to daily mandatory maintenance and inspection by 8 minutes for any departures that are scheduled at 10:00. All passengers are expected to be on time, as otherwise must wait for the next departure.

The set has a few useful pieces like the cars with an open front and a flip top roof. Then there's the train fender and front chimney. If you have enough regular lego bricks you can modify this as easily as your imagination can take you. 

The owning value of this set isnt really much. It's really for the completionists who dont have it yet. But if you already have it, then go ahead and keep it. I just checked ebay and there's only 2 results as of the date I submit this.

Pros: Nice figs, nice pieces and accessories. Will provide hours of fun for your child.

Cons: Not that much useful pieces. Will provide minutes of fun for you by itself but maybe even more for custom designing.

You're probably not looking for this set and only discovered this review in an update. The reasons I reviewed this set was for nostalgia and that it took me long to figure out what the product number was. But if you are looking for it, I hope this review helps you well enough, as it appears no one else had a review for it. Soooooo...bye.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
