"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-01T16:35:50.687Z","X-Fun Baseplate!","This is the best baseplate I own, I use it for my city. At the present time my city is really only a small multi-story complex with a landing space Cloud City styles. I have twelve of these and I have set them up in a six by two alignment so that the city is not to fat that you stand in it. It is also the perfect number to place my extra long train track in that I have not used since last year. The only problem I have come across in the baseplates alignment is that it easily slides out of place. I secure that by placing a four by four tile over where ech corners meet. The green Grocer set just got released today and I hope in the future, when I have collected all Star wars then these baseplates will support the whole town buildings. Right now though, the baseplates are being used to hold junk, really. I need the street sweeper set to clean it up. The problem is that I like seeing things blown up, really. 

There isn't much to review, unless I would individually review each stud. The grey colour really captures the city look, and since they are all stuck together I can't make two different scenes. I do own a green baseplate, and it is usefull once in a while for creating field scenes, usually with the MTT. 

With all my baseplates, I hope to make a model of Coruscant, with the classic Dexter's Diner. Right now my main goal is to raise to train track and get it level with the second story of my complex.

This is better than roads, because of mainly two reasons. Firstly, with roads, they are completely flat in the road part. No minifigure can safely stand in the middle of the road. In this, you can make your own road. Secondly, when you make your own road, you can make it as wide as you want, instead of having cars too big or too small on your road. All you need is a few flat pieces. It is also better than a stream or cusomized baseplate becuase this one has no limits and you can do whatever you want with it.

Overall this is a very good way to start off your city or, as it says, whatever you imagination leads you to. The pricing is a little concerning, put together it is, at least. I think that it is worth it and whatever happens you are bound to find a practical use for it. Buy this set in lots of two. it soon seems less and less. You need to buy this set, it may not seem like much, but it is worth it in the long run. Trust me, I know.

"donneyboy","2009-01-18T12:00:00.89Z","a great building piece","i got this set when i was younger, and i love it. it is great to build houses, bases, or anything on it. my friend and i would build two bases on it, one for me, and one for him, then we would have a battle. now i dont, i just build on it. 

pros- 
great for building
fun to use

cons-
hard to store
put to much weight on it, and it bends when you pick it up. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The only problem is that my brother wants it for only himself. I'm going to ask him if we can divide it in two, so we can play both. So, if I lost time with talking about my brother, here is my rating:

"HQuiff","2009-08-09T06:57:37.577Z","The Great Gray Baseplate","I bought this over a year ago on Holiday in England for £6.99, and trust me, it is absolutely wonderful, and hugely appealing, as well as being useful and handy. 

I've used it already for about 6 - 7 Creations, and seeing as it's just completely gray (And huge) you can use it for ANY theme, for ANY building, or even as an outside place.

That's about it really, I'm currently using it for my Plaza and Skatepark. Hope you found my review useful!

The size of this baseplate is also very good measuring 15''X15''. However, the price tag of it is not very appealing because I think that this is not worth more than £10.
