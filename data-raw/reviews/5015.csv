I used blue plates to build the river, but I then also had to raise the water wheel and the stove with plates forming the basis. If I hadn't done this, the water wheel would have touched the baseplate. It couldn't rotate. 

The tree hideout is also cool and the carriage and the trucks and some pirates models and so on and so on. Get it! The models you can build are really great! This idea book was released when - so I believe - LEGO had reached its climax!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-26T08:31:29.343Z","Builders Bible","This item was a true gem in it's day. I remember as a kid getting it and thinking I could build a LEGO world. How wrong I was. Don't get me wrong it's an excellent addition to LEGO's arsenal of models, I was just pedantic about right pieces and correct colors. Today having this is the best as my collection has grown much larger since then and with sites like bricklink you can order any or all the pieces you need.

The book is 48 pages of designs and a sticker sheet. mine is in mint condition as I never used them as a kid as I hate them so much. The book gives ideas for:

Basic
Town
Race Cars
Beach
Trucks
Dark Forrest
Crusaders
Black Knights
Pirates
Space Police
Blacktron
M-Tron

These are the main series I can identify. Instructions for all and lots of other models in the background to help you with more ideas. This is a 10/10. I would seriously say go and hunt high and low for this book if you can get one. I paid $0.50c back in the day. If I only knew.

"Hobie819","2012-06-11T08:28:57.97Z","Great ideas - would be better if:","<p>I got this book as a child - it had a lot of great ideas but unfortunately used a lot of pieces that weren't widely available (ones where there was a one off set) so unless you had that set you were out of luck with making an exact replica using the instructions.&nbsp; Of course you can make substitutes but it felt as if I were to be heavily modifying it I may as well just see a picture on the back of a box of alternate builds and work&nbsp; that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think that books like this would be a great idea for LEGO with some caveats.&nbsp; For one, It would be great to make a book for a particular theme.&nbsp; Take for instance the mining theme of 2012. After releasing all of the models in that set, release a book that has alternate builds for that theme - maybe even include it in the boxed set. This would ensure&nbsp;builders have all of the pieces necessary to construct the alternate builds while allowing for builders to have other things that they can do with the sets.&nbsp; Another example would be the police theme for a particular year - include alternate instructions that once the owners owns all of the theme, they can construct a maximum security super prison a long with other ideas.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultinately the book is great but as mkentioned below, once you are a year past the book's release, it becomes more difficult to gather the pieces needed forcing builders to go the brinklink or other brick buying websites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building experience:&nbsp; The builds inside were great and gave amny new ideas.&nbsp; As mentioned above though, many parts were only found in a few or in some cases, one set which made/makes it difficult to construct them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parts:&nbsp; Stickers were nice and allowed you to modify the overall look of your models but in the end they are stickers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playability: The sets inside are very playable and have different themes depending on what your interests are.</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,5,4

I think it was a great book, plus it came with a few nice stickers...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-02-22T00:48:17Z","Lovely Idea Book","Found this book on a garage sale, and got it for free after I purchased some of the Legos available there.<br>When i look at the cover, I felt that the book wont worth anything but after looked through the pages, found that this book is really filled with lots of amazing ideas.<br>It really gives a new perspective of building lego for me. And you can create lots and lots items from this idea book, ranging from cars to pirates.<br><br>I think Lego should produce more books like this, instead of launching book with stikers or activities. This one really in line with the building spirit of Lego.<br><br><br>",TRUE,4,1,4,4,5
"carlosfsm","2014-05-04T01:23:30.85Z","Good for any kid that was starting...","<p>Wow. I remember this Idea book. I remember trying to build many of the sets that this book suggested but I always got to the point where I wouldn&#39;t have the pieces needed. However, this was a good excuse to either get the imagination flowing to see what other ways I could do to build a &quot;similar&quot; set or, just to get more sets bought &nbsp;=)</p>

<p>I remember also that I liked to spend time just by looking at the pictures of the different themes and dream that I could have so many LEGO&#39;s one day. That never happened.</p>
