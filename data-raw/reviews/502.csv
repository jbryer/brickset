I have this brick built rabbit from 1990 and another from 1992. I don&#39;t remember many other brick built rabbits from LEGO and it would be nice to get more.</p>

<p>This set looks good. The print is detailed enough for the time and the 1x1 round studs work great as buck teeth. The rabbit seems to be wearing blue pants, a red shirt, and a red hat. It is cartoony, but fun as a small toy for kids.</p>

<p>Overall I like this set, though it is not the best. This can be chalked up to it being an older model, but this also makes it kind of charming. It is nothing to spend a lot of money to get new, but it is still nice to have.</p>
