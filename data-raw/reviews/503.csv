There are no special parts (all are quite common) and the builds on the front of the box are not that appealing. There is not too much to say about this set. It is not a fantastic set and it just seems like it was a parts pack that was given the label&nbsp;of &quot;Special Offer&quot; just to make it sell better.</p>
