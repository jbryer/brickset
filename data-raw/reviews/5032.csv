"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-03-02T20:39:46.043Z","An excellent, cheaper-by-the-dozen opportunity","Lego very rarely ever clumps elements of separate sets together (in their original design) and sells them as a big combo set, so I jumped as this once-in-a-lifetime, cheaper by the dozen opportunity. What is strange about the set is that it was almost not publicized at all, adding the “super special limited edition etc.” feel. It was very rare and was snapped up almost immediately during the limited-edition U.S. release. I picked mine up at the store section of that “Art of Star Wars” exhibit when it came to Singapore recently. 

Ultimate Space Battle recreates that dramatic Episode III opening sequence, the pivotal bits anyway. This huge set comprises Anakin’s starfighter, a Droid Tri-Fighter, two vulture droids and a new, never-before-seen feature, Obi-Wan’s red Jedi starfighter, with R4-P17 included (only the head, of course). It set me back S$ 79.90, which is actually unusually generous of Lego, though it might have been a special discount, I’m not too sure.

Minifigs first, as always. Obi-Wan and Anakin, both, happily, without attached light-up lightsabers, are the main figs in the set. The pilot headsets are painted onto the flesh-toned minifig heads. They don’t come with capes, though they should (if you watch the film closely you can notice that). I added my own capes, just to be accurate and plus, they do look better with capes attached. Two buzz droids are added, if you want to count them as minifigs. They look excellent, albeit far too big! If I wait long enough I’ll be able to auction off one of my buzz droids: there is a slight misprint on the dome. R4 and R2 are present, but only the domes and not the rest of them as the wings on which they rest are quite thin.

Component breakdown time! I’ll begin with the prominent JSFs. Quite movie-accurate, except, like all the other ships in this set, it suffers from utilizing FAR TOO MANY STICKERED ELEMENTS! I really dislike stickers, as you can be assured that a few months down the line they’ll be flaking, cracking and peeling off the model. The little wings to the side use a new bar method to move up and down into or out of attack mode, but that downplays certainty. The die-hard fans will want the wings or S-Foils to open up exactly at the same angles on each side. In the past, Lego would have used more efficient click-hinge joints to do the job. Speaking about click-hinge joints, the clip-jointed lading pads, now a common feature in most Lego Star Wars ships, serve their purpose though some critics think they provide insufficient support. Here’s a tip: to photograph your model taking off from the ground or table (seemingly, of course), position the landing mechanisms a-Pointe (on their tips) and photograph from the top, showing some distance below but hiding the mechanisms from view. There’s a little trouble when it comes to the control stick that looks a little like a feeding tube. Altogether quite cool, sleek and very “swooshable”.

Next up (drum roll please) is the droid tri-fighter! An ingenious ensemble of the afore-mentioned click/hinge joints encircle the main dome to create the nice skeletal look. The buzz droid sits nicely in the central dome. Actually, the buzz droids are supposed to be stored in missiles and a droid rain should occupy the dome instead, but that kind of scaling is absolutely near-impossible. The craft is, actually, quite simple in build and, if you ask me, not too worth the money if brought on its own. As part of this set, however, this unmanned ship is just nice.

When it comes to vulture droids, this set features two so you can let your whiny younger brother, jealous best friend or the rare interested parent build one. The other Lego set that comes to mind is the Droid Starfighter from Episode I. While relatively close in design to that craft, the Vulture Droid features welcome improvements. For one, it looks more organic as compared to the slightly angular look of its predecessor. The legs, if you want to call them that, can now close in or open out, pivoting instead of being so rigid. This comes in handy to switch in between “walker” and “flying” modes. The irritating bit is that the “legs” and the head are unable to freely slide in/out and pop up/down respectively, so have to pluck out the elements and reposition them manually. Overall however, it’s a nice, rather indispensable bit of this big set.

There isn’t too much doubt about it, if you see this set, grab it. Please don’t mind if I sound like some advertising guy, but this really is your only chance to grab hold of the coveted and much-sought-after red JSF belonging to Obi-Wan and quite a bargain indeed. No second thoughts when it comes to this set, remember the American limited release. No more stock left in minutes.

"brickbuster2409","2007-04-13T17:14:34.85Z","finally: obi wan's starfighter ","it's a waste of $$$ if you get anakin's starfighter and the droid fighter.  this set has a great value.  the starfighters cost about $20 together.  the droid starfighters cost about $20 together and the tri fighter is about $15.  so that's $55 at the value price.  great buy huh?  anyway back to the set quality.  once again, the droid fighters are better designed than the brown counterparts b/c they include blasters on the wings and the color, i have to say, is better.  i think obi wan and anakin need to come with capes but i can settle for them without them.  again the buzz droids don't really belong inside the tri fighter but they're a great addition.  the jedi fighters are well accurate including a good cockpit and wings and the landing gear is a great addition.  get those droids!!

I feel bad, people who can't afford $50 won't get the red one, it is so good! Or-just buy it seperately off of ebay!and also, where is the last buzz droid going to go?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-07-22T20:34:46.25Z","&quot;This is where the fun begins&quot;.","I love this set.

Pros:
Obi Wan mini fig
Anakin mini fig
2 Buzz droids
2 jedi starfighters(red and yellow)These are built very well. The cockpit opens nicely, the wings can open and close, they have landing gear, they are very detailed, sturdy, and swooshable. 
2 vulture droids. These aren't my favorite, but in a set with all of this, they are super cool. Their wings can rotate for when they land, they're detailed, sturdy and swooshable.
Tri Fighter droid- this is my absolute favorite part of this set. This ship has a fantastic design, it's sturdy, super detailed, the center holds a buzz droid, and it open to release it into space, it's swooshable. 

This set has wonderful playability, and it also looks great on display. There are no flaws at all, and it is worth the price( I'd pay double its price to get it).

Enjoy! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"JTR_11","2008-10-31T14:47:25.077Z","Fantastic set, was quite cheap i believe.","this set is the ultimate battle. fun yet easy to build, i love this set. extremely fun to play with (thats wat its for) and 5 models in one, its amazing! little buzz droids are cool and obiwans fighter rules!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alfred_the_buttler","2020-01-07T23:26:53.913Z","Hello Repitition","<p>This is definitely a dry fun set to play with. You get both Anakin&#39;s and Obiwan&#39;s star fighters (and minifigures) but only their R2 units&#39; heads which are a detail on the ship. You get one of the droid trifighters along with two buzz droid minifigures&nbsp;(although only one can fit inside the fighter). You also get two vulture droids. So in total you are getting 5 fighters and 4 minifigures. Obviously this allows for a lot of playability, but the downside is that it feels like 5 100 piece sets instead of a nearly 600 piece set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Trifighter</p>

<p>This is actually identical to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7252-1/Droid-Tri-Fighter"">7252</a>&nbsp;right down to the stickers. The only difference is you get two buzz droids instead of just one. So the cool thing is if you wanted to you could easily expand this set by purchasing more of the other one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;This in my opinion is the most interesting build as it is round and triangular, two shapes that aren&#39;t too easy to create with Lego. Learning how it pulls it off is actually pretty interesting, but then building it is rather tedious. You need to repeat the same 4 brick build I believe 18 times! Don&#39;t get me wrong, the model looks great and I don&#39;t think Lego could have designed this any better, but boy is it a boring build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anakin and Obiwan&#39;s ships</p>

<p>So you build Anakin&#39;s first followed by Obiwan&#39;s. The two ships are identical, they just use different color schemes. They are nice looking ships and at least are fun little builds. Although you will race through Obiwan&#39;s&nbsp;since there are no surprises. There is nothing too difficult or unique about them, and I do rather like the design of the cockpit where the top opens but front stays in place. I do have a few problems with it however. For one despite having huge cockpits, there is no holder for the lightsaber, you just need to throw it in loose (which even the instructions show). Also the connection for the front cockpit and control is weak, it should have been better reinforced as it is easy to knock off. Finally, the two flaps on either wing have nothing to keep them in the correct positions, this in sure can be easily modified, but usually operable flaps like these have bricks to stop them from going too far on Lego sets. But overall these are very nice little models and I would say the highlight of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vulture Droids</p>

<p>You build two of these very simple droids. Their instructions take up all of two pages. However, despite their simplicity, the models do look good. Their blue design is much more appealing than the brown one found in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7111-1/Droid-Fighter"">7111</a>. They can be rearranged to stand upright and the wings can be split apart or together, however they don&#39;t transform, to rearrange them they need to be partially deconstructed and put back together, although at this scale it would be difficult to have moving parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This set is great as it gives you a lot to play with. The problems with it are mainly the simplicity of it being a inch of smaller sets in one box, and the fact that everything about it is repetition. But if you are looking to recreate a space battle from the Clone Wars, there is no better set than this one!</p>
