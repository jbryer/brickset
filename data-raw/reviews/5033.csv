The good things about this set is its a lot less flimsy than the other one. Also, you open the wings manually, which if you read my other reviews, you know I like. I think lego does this to make the piece count higher to then make the price higher. As for the figs... the white guy is screwed and the red guy is a bit plain. I hate how the rebals all have smiliy faces, no emotion or even hair. (I wouldn't be happy going up against the death star.) This set is good though it gets a B.

INTRO
Back in 2000 or so, Lego released a B-Wing set.  It was a little bit of scale, and somewhat blocky (for some odd reason all of the 1999-2000 Star Wars sets were blocky), but it did the job.  So why Lego released another one 7 years latter is beyond me.  With all this aside it seemed to find a way in to my collection (possibly because I don't own the firs B-Wing).  Now, onto the review!

LOOKS
The B-Wing is very faithful to its movie counterpart, which as far as I can remember doesn’t even make a debut in Episode 6.  The only real problem is the missile &quot;launcher&quot;.  If I hadn't looked at the box, I would've thought it was a missile dropper.  And even if it did work, it would prove some Legos are being juniorized *sigh*.

The decals on the B-Wing are actually OK.  Their actually used for symbols (with the acceptation of the landing/fixing pad). Instead of some lazy Lego designer using &quot;them stupid stickers&quot; instead of grebing.

The cockpit is also ok, although more controls would be nice.  I known there's not much room in there, but all Lego has to do is print controls, on the two side bricks.  8/10 for looks.

SIZE IN RELATIONS WITH COPPERATE MARKETING
The B-wing is in good scale with the movie (like I mentioned earlier). However, Lego could lose the Landing/fixing pad, and drop $10.00 (USD) from the price.  5/10.

FEATURES
Instead of complaing about the missile &quot;launcher&quot; all over again, I will talk about the wings and cockpit.  The wings use &quot;old clicky joints&quot; to fold up and down.  I think Lego has achieved this perfictly.  The cockpit is alright, but doesen’t always rotate.  7/10 for the lovely wings and OK cockpit.

MINIFIGS
The rebel pilot is beautiful from head to toe. He's basically just a red A-Wing pilot.  Although I do like his helmet soooo much!  Ted Numb is another story.  I mean, he looks like a cross between Admiral Ackenbar and a two-headed fish!

OVERALL
With the exception of the stupid stand and Admiral Ackebar, a great set!  Overall (not an average of the scores), 8/10.

"perc","2007-10-12T23:37:54.607Z","ok set","after building this, i realised i had used the yellow bricks (for the service tower)inside as the missile firing mechanism instead of lighter bricks, so i had to dismantle to swap them over.

"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-11-09T19:06:34.937Z","Dedication to my friend","First, I would like to dedicate this review to my friend, because of he wasn't my friend and didn't have such a nice heart, then having this set would be impossible. Next, I would like to thank Lego for having this set not discontinued, because I got this a month ago. (Yes, they're still out there!)

This set is very good because it has 2 minifigs, b-wing pilot and Ben Numb, or whatever that guy's name is called. 

The cockpit rotates so the pilot will always be level with the ground (thats pretty awsome!) The wings could go up or down, depending if its in attack postion or flying postion. it even comes with its own stand, making it storable anywhere and doesn't take up so much space. 

Now some cons: 
-The fighter isn't even (symetrical, I can't spell it!).
-the ion cannons that shoots out the stuff doesn't go very far, and one slides out when i move the fighter
-DO NOT hold the fighter by the cockpit. I learned the hard way. the engine and the wings fell off, and the only thing in my hand was the cockpit. I had to find and re-build all the pieces later. (And yes, I found all the pieces) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The minifigs are good too. It also shoots rockets, but you have to hold it back in order for it to work. The stand makes for easy put away and doesn't take up much room.

"millacol88","2008-01-29T16:20:08.61Z","Awesome and accurate, but with a few flaws","This set is very good. It looks almost exactly like it should, and it is quite sturdy. There are many cannons, which makes the model look decidedly more venerable than the previous incarnation. however, as the title says, there are a couple of flaws. Firstly, the missile firing mechanism is simply terrible. Every time you try to pull back the knob at the back that controls the missile, the knob either breaks off or the missiles don't go very far, usually both. I would have preferred it if they had used a spring powered missile, similar to the one used in the new naboo fighter. The second problem is the display stand. It holds the b-wing in a vertical position. The b-wing actually lands horizontally, however. Also, the display stand is very flimsy and doesn't hold it up well. I took it apart and used some of the pieces to make a better display stand for my naboo fighter and used some of the pieces I had left to make the b-wing more balanced while landing horizontally.

Pros:
-awesome model, looks great
-not repetitive to build
-a reasonable price
-and a large improvement over the old one.

Cons:
-display stand is flimsy and holds the fighter in wrong orientation
-nothing else!

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-02-25T21:59:00.577Z","Awesome set that doesn't get enough credit!","This B-wing is a great set. It was my set that truely got me into buying larger sets (going on to buying the Y-wing, and $50+ sets) but I've got to say it's just one of the best. Great value of 435 pieces for only $35, two figures, and something one doesn't see too often--a landing bay! A true service bay that steadies the ship and displays it some kind of well. The ship itself is massive when the wings are spread out in their total glory, and strikes fear into any enemy pilots! The cockpit remains stable as the rest of the ship is rotating (true to the movie and EU description) and has 9 total guns, plus two rockets in the mid launcher (although they fall out extremely easily).

Build wise, this set contains mainly standard pieces (no technic here) besides the rubber band in the launcher, and is an easier job for regular builders (at the time I wasn't too nimble with my building skills just yet--it took me a good three hours). The minifigs are great with Ten Numb and a regular B-wing Rebel Pilot. Overall, I'd recommend this set because it's one of the most sturdy ships I own, has its own landing bay and display stand, includes rare minifigures, and has great playability.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box certainly isn't as 'pretty' as the newer ones. &nbsp;It doesn't have a glossy finish nor does it have flashy and colorful art. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, the box is almost entirely dark colors. &nbsp;My least favorite part about the box is that its the punch-two-holes-and-rip-the-box-in-nine-pieces way to open it rather than the tab the newer boxes have. &nbsp;I'd even rather it be a flap with nothing on it than this. &nbsp;</p><p>The instructions aren't much of an improvement. &nbsp;Every page has a darker gray background with stars on it. &nbsp;While it's cool to have a dark gray starry background, it's kind of tough on the eyes when the pages show you how to build a dark gray ship.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Lots of good parts here. &nbsp;Plenty of curved slops in gray and dark gray, great parts for making ships of your own. &nbsp;Some nice yellow is thrown in as part of the stand as well.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigs seem very 'plain' to me, but I'm very used to the newer insanely detailed SW minifigs. &nbsp;Having said that, I do like these minifigs for what they are. &nbsp;Ten Numb is fairly believable (when his helmet is on) and a good example of what Lego can accomplish with simple minifigs rather than new molds for every character. &nbsp;The B-Wing Pilot is very simple (fleshie version of normal minifig face!) but gets the job done. &nbsp;His helmet has a nice print on it as well.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Most of the parts are nice big blocky ship parts. &nbsp;That made the build very fun for me, as I don't like being bogged down by lots of small parts or technic for a model like this. &nbsp;The thing comes together fairly quickly as most of the build is quite simple. &nbsp;The most complicated portion is probably the missile firing mechanism near the engines. &nbsp;All in all a good building experience.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The finished product is quite big. &nbsp;The wings fold in and out nicely as they are built using strong hinges. &nbsp;Perhaps the coolest part about this set is that the cockpit spins when you turn the ship on end or upside down. &nbsp;That right there adds so much to its swoosh-factor. &nbsp;</p><p>The missile-firing mechanism is plain awful and my least favorite part of the set. &nbsp;Not only do the missiles fall out on their own (I'm trying to swoosh here!), but the technic plunging piece you pull back just gets pulled out half the time.</p><p>The stand, while a thrown-together bunch of a pieces, serves its function quite well. &nbsp;It can open and close for a cool launching effect, and when you put the model on its stand you really get an appreciation for how big it is.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this is a pretty good set in my opinion. &nbsp;Its certainly not the prettiest or flashiest build I've done, but its big and refreshingly solid. &nbsp;Not only that, but it retailed for $35 USD, which seems like an absolute steal for this set. &nbsp;When I consider the 7959 Geonosian Starfighter retails for $30 USD, I can't believe the value this set has.</p><p>If you are interested in the B-Wing's unique design and find this at around retail, I'd say pick it up. &nbsp;It's a fun, solid build and even more fun to swoosh around (after you give up on the missile firing).</p><p>Happy Building!</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,5

The cockpit rotates, the s-foils extend, and there are guns-galore on this set; just like a heavy fighter-bomber is supposed to have.</li><li>Pro 2: Good playability; this set is sturdy enough to be swooshable, and the moving parts don't feel like they will fall off during use. I like the forward opening cockpit, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 3: The build was fun, you had to pay close attention to everything because there is a good mix of Technic parts holding the different sections together. But a well-designed set for building. I also like the use of tan pieces to off-set the greys.&nbsp;</li><li>Pro 4: The stand has gotten mixed reviews, but I like it. I am able to display the B-Wing standing up, leaving more shelf space for other ships (I have Home One next to it). The B-Wing is pretty top-heavy, but the stand does a good job holding it up.</li><li>Pro 5: The two minifigures that are pretty cool. B-Wing pilot and Ten Nunb are exclusive to this set, and are good additions to a collection.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Like other reviewers have mentioned I think the biggest mark against this set is the lower tail section; it is only half-way finished. The bottom is completely flat, making what is supposed to be symmetrical (when looking at it head-on) asymmetrical.&nbsp;</li><li>Con 2: Also like the others have said the missile firing mechanism doesn't work too well. But at least they are flick-missiles.</li></ul>
<p>With different versions of the B-Wing from which to choose I would give this one my recommendation. It still can be found for a decent price and is a good example of the heavy fighter-bomber that assaulted the second Death Star. The pieces are pretty cool, a good mix of color in with the usual grey. Every collection of Rebel ships needs a B-Wing and this one fits in nicely.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4

"zipsforbananas","2012-06-01T17:52:01.343Z","One of the best of the early sets. Much to improve, but great nonetheless.","<p>I don't know what happened to Lego in 2006, but all of a sudden the sets became decent! (Compare the 2004 Y-wing in 7262 with 2007's 7658.) Another effort in 2009 has made some of them look a little dated (See Slave I, AT-AT, AT-ST, Snowspeeder, etc. Although I prefer the 2007 Y-wing to the 2012 model, and don't quite see the point of the X-wing update - the 3x6 slopes on the wings are dreadful!), but this one holds its own against the newer updates.</p><p>Granted, it does look very much like an older set - the styling is clumsy in places compared to the sleeker new batch. The large wedges that practically make up the wings in one go do bring back nightmares of the 2000 Falcon and its dreadful 4-piece hull. Next to all my other nicely mainly-white (with-another-colour) rebel sets this is unashamedly grey; it's pretty big too. And there's no getting away from how the careful symmetry is ruined by the dreadfully off centre the bottom fin. But somehow, despite all these gripes, I still love this set!</p><p><br></p><p>I collect sets more for the love of building, displaying and owning them, but this set is so tactile I can't stop holding it! Swooshability is through the roof! It's easy to hold, and you can't imagine you could break it either, pieces don't fall off easily. The rotating cockpit and the angles of the wings mean you can hold it and turn it for hours. This hold-ability makes you totally forgive any 2006 era shortcomings you might notice. The volume the large wedges give the wings, the fins in the engine vents, and the size of the guns means it looks substantial too. And the real treat is the stand it comes with - lovely and bright, with two stickers adding a lot to the top. Ten Numb is a great figure; his face is simply printed and the helmet makes him look grand.</p><p>You might have noticed I've not mentioned the missiles yet - because they're not worth mentioning! They only sit in, so are prone to just fall out of a set that begs you to turn it. They have to be tilted back else they won't fire - they have to fall back in to the holes as you pull the trigger back. And no matter what you do you won't get them more than 10cm from the ship - literally! Forget them, pretend it's not meant to have them!</p><p><br></p><p>I've also not mentioned the 2000 version. Again, it's not worth mentioning! The wings were nothing more than plates, Technic struts were left exposed - it looks like a child designed it. This is not a vast improvement; it's so much better you can't quite believe they're both meant to be the same ship!</p><p>And though the 2012 UCS version is truly excellent in terms of film likeness (except for that disappointing cockpit piece) it's not minifigure scale so doesn't dislodge this one from it's place at all. To be honest, this one was already dwarfing the other minifigure scale ships (it does best off playing with the magnificent but far too big 2012 TIE fighter!), the UCS was never going to be a replacement so much as another set in another wave.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm going to reverse the normal order here, as the pros very much make up for the cons...</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Absolutely useless missiles!</li><li>Awfully off centre and bare-backed bottom fin</li><li>At first glance it looks a little dark and shoddy, but...</li></ul>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>...very quickly you see how well and economically designed it is</li><li>It's so tactile! Pick it up! Hold it! Rotate it!</li><li>Cracking extras with the maintenance bay, Ten Numb, tools et al</li><li>The unfolding wings, rotating cockpit and chunky wings and guns are very pleasing</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>I can't get over how pleased I am with this set! The bottom fin is a fatal flaw; I think it would bother me forever if I hadn't found a way to correct it. But it is correctable with a little effort (plus a way to move the 1x6 Technic piece down 'through' the plate base, and a duplicate set of wedges and outer plates to attach to the reverse with a lot of Technic ""connect peg with knob""s). If the bottom fin bothers you and you don't fancy trying to fix it then avoid this set. Otherwise, get it! Surprise yourself! You'll love it!</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
"DDenissssss","2012-10-20T14:50:56.18Z","The first detailed B-wing","I got this set in 2006 and it looked very large and detailed after 1999 or 2000 version. Minifigures are very interesting. Engine part is well detailed and in past I thought it's a brilliant copy of the one from the film, but when I saw the difference between this and 10227, I googled and found that this one has too long side wings, too thin main wing too thin cockpit and the part between cockpit and engine. But it's a good model, it;s interesting to play, you get 2 pilots and a station, and it has a 'hyroscopic' cockpit which means that it's in one position, no matter which way the fighter moves.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,4
