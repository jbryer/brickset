"Monty","2006-01-11T07:57:23Z","The Saga is Complete.","In my opinion this is the best-looking TIE of the lot and well worth waiting for. I had previously made one from spares using TIE parts left over from set 10131 the TIE Collection and when I compared it to the set they were amazingly similar. I remember when I reviewed that set, I suggested one of the 2 normal TIEs should be replaced with an interceptor – perhaps now they will reissue a revised TIE Collection set that includes the Interceptor. It follows the normal TIE method of construction, the cockpit is identical to Vader’s TIE, but it has to be said it seems sturdier than the norm. I suspect if there were quality control problems with bricks in the new colours when they first came out, these have now been ironed out and the fit is snugger – not to say you can’t still get the wings to wobble if you really try. Wings contain some nice detail on the centre panels. The cockpit also seems less prone to bursting in your hands if you handle it and open the front to access the pilot. Price was OK 18 GBP - 15 would have been nicer. Again I got what I expected so I’ll give it a maximum score – especially for the improved fit.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"p0dracer","2006-03-30T09:37:51Z","Amazing set!","This set really blew my expectations. The size is perfect. The design is great and accurate. It feels solid in the hands. The way the 4 slanted wing panels snap down is amazing. I think its my favourite lego set so far.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2006-04-16T07:53:50Z","Great! but.....","when i first got this set, i thought it was great! i built it in 2mins and i really liked it. the minifig was great, and it looked very good. its not rare to have a model that looks like the real thing, but this as an excellent deseign!

the one problem i had was that this set rolls on its face when i try to stand it up, maybe a deseign fault? its more of a playing model than one whom lives on a shelf! it costs more than a normal tie, but wellworth the extra money. if you are a tie fan then get this model now to add to your collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-11-02T22:32:52Z","Tried and tested Formula that works!","This set adopts the tried and tested TIE craft formula, with similar wing arrangement and cockpit design, and is proof that it truly succeeds! Fans such as myself have been hankering long and hard for a minifig-scale incarnation of this speedy spacecraft, and are finally pacified.

"david001","2007-03-26T16:54:35.87Z","Flawless model","Ah: the good old TIE Interceptor. The last of the original TIE designs to appear in the movies, the Interceptor is a superb fighter craft, boasting four lasers instead of two.

The model is superb as well: there's no mistaking those twin prong wings or the top and bottom 'fold'.  While the wings do suffer from the slight wobbliness that plagues all the other Lego TIE family, the ball cockpit is a superb reproduction of the original: it's great how Lego managed to pull that off out of mainly essentially square bricks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gert_Jan","2007-08-18T09:27:29.643Z","Best of the familie","I think this set is the best of the TIE familie. It has great looking wings and more weapons. The pilot looks great and it has a black head instead of a brown one. But I think this TIE is a bit to blue. Not that I don't like the blue colour but this is a bit to mutch. But how cares? It is stil the best looking TIE there is so if you like TIE fighters then I sugest in buying one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Darth_Shockwave","2007-10-13T11:06:21.2Z","The Tie's finally complete","The Tie Interceptor, the update of the Tie Fighter and the cheaper design variation of Vader's Tie advance. The Interceptor makes it's one and only appearance in Return of the Jedi. Most notebly during the end core run, several Interceptors are chasing Lando and Wedge. This model is once again made in the Lego Tie colours of black, blue and grey, I know the actual fighters are black and dark, but I think the Lego colours suit it nicley. The attention to detail is very nice with the guns and targeting sensors looking quite like how they should. The cockpit is the same one thats used in the other Tie Fighter models, it's a mixture off the 2. Which is good as it gives the fighters a sence off familiarity. Funnily enough the base off the model is designed for a stand, the same one used in the first Tie fighter model. But Lego did not give us one, strange. Anyways onto the pro's and con's.

Pro's: - 
Use's same Tie cockpit
Fleet builder
Finally made after 7 years
Good attention to detail
Fits in well with othe Tie's class fighters

Con's: - 
The cockpit hatch can come of too easily
Does not come with display stand
Wobbley wings

Overall: - This is a nicely put together set, which is a very welcome addition to the Imperial fleet. Just why did it not come out earlier.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Real TIE I was smaller! Now, in LEGO design it&#180;s wider than normal TIE. In films, the wings were closer to the cocpit. As well I don&#180;t understand, why there that blue color is!

The wings probably have the most detail including an Empire symbol and blue bars against then black wings. Then there are the two bars on each side connecting the wings to the body. These aren't the best and are ugly in my opinion. Luckily those awsome wings make up for it. The body is okay. The cockpit has the octaganal shape design on it which is a nice touch. On the cockpit are also 2 guns. I guess they're guns, they could be headlights. And as all tie fighters have, This one has the topshell piece with those electronic designs.

<p>Though not really anything groundbreaking, the Interceptor is a worthy addition to the Imperial Fleet, in the way that it is aerodynamic and swooshable to a great degree. It comes with a standard TIE pilot and control panel, with better-fitted hatch plate (uses a 2x4 plate rather than a 2x1 part) and reinforced rear (uses a niche part at the back of the cockpit).

","<p>This set is&nbsp;a great&nbsp;set for any true Star Wars fan.&nbsp;When released in 2006, I&nbsp;didn't take much&nbsp;notice&nbsp;of it. But my little&nbsp;brother's birthday was coming up, so&nbsp;I popped on over to a Walmart, and&nbsp;picked one up. Since then, I've played with it more than he has!</p>
<p>&nbsp;What I really like about this set is its look:&nbsp;it has an overall dagger-like shape that adds a&nbsp;touch of menace about it. I think it has to be one of&nbsp;the meanest looking&nbsp;starfighters in&nbsp;Star Wars. The four wing-tip cannons, combined with the chin blasters, make it&nbsp;look much more sinister than, say, a&nbsp;Y-wing. I don't even think the grotesque TIE Defender set&nbsp;can match its simple, yet beastly, look.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is also&nbsp;pretty sturdy, and&nbsp;its&nbsp;fun to 'swish' around your room with an X-wing or A-wing set, if you like to do that sort&nbsp;of thing&nbsp;(which I do ;)&nbsp;Also, it has 212 pieces, so $20 is&nbsp;an even price for it, though the pieces aren't all that exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, like all TIE sets, it was&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;repetitive build, and&nbsp;there's not a whole lot of ""action"" features. You can load&nbsp;the Imperial pilot in, move his little control panel, and that's abou it. So if action features, like missile launchers or&nbsp;ejection seats, are your thing, I wouldn't recommend this set.&nbsp;And it only comes with one minifig, although&nbsp;I don't know how they could include another one.&nbsp;Also, some people&nbsp;might not like the blue&nbsp;coloring, it being in contrast to the gray and black of&nbsp;Darth Vader's TIE and the&nbsp;new Defender. However, I don't mind it&nbsp;at all, as I think it gives the&nbsp;set a sort of 'classic' LEGO Star Wars feel to it; and if you don't like the blue tiles, you could always replace them with some gray tiles. On to the pros and cons!</p>

<li>Pros: 
<li>Menacing look! 
<li>Decent piece to price ratio. 
<li>Cool old-school&nbsp;Imperial&nbsp;pilot minifigure.

(Previously, I had only had the early MINI collection) So naturally, it holds an important spot in my collection. The value for money is hard to determine, because it was a gift, but I see that it was around 20.00 USD, which I think is a little overpriced. As many before me have stated, the panels should be Grey and not Blue. But don't let that deter you, the blue adds interest. The build was a short and pleasant experience, especially the cockpit. There is a lot of room in that cockpit, so I was able to give my TIE Pilot minifigure a blaster and radio, for personality. (I'm still proud of my old-mold minifigure, as oppose to the new, albeit more realistic helmet mold.) The finished model feels a little flimsy around the wings, and so it is. You ought to be a little careful when swooshing. Speaking of swooshing, by the way, this model is really swoosh-able. It's very playable, and makes for great battles if you have an Alliance starfighter.</p><h4>Pros</h4>

Being a big fan of all things Imperial (especially the TIEs) I had to have this set. I know many people aren't fans of the old school blue/black TIEs, but this one is a decent set and a good addition to the collection.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: The set is true to its ROTJ movie appearances. LEGO did a good job designing this set. It also has more detail than other TIE sets of this era, especially in the wings/solar panels. <br></li><li>Pro 2: It is a pretty straight-forward and quick build, the wings taking the most time. To cut down on the repetitive feeling I built them at the same time. You get some good black plates and some nice blue tiles for your collection.<br></li><li>Pro 3: Good playability. Not great, but pretty good. This set is simple, not much to it, so it has a cockpit that opens/closes and wings that pop off easily.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: As with all TIEs of this generation LEGO didn't put much into it. The set is basic, not much there. I have the new Vader's TIE version and it has a lot more detail. I hope LEGO re-releases the TIE Interceptor with more detail and more playability.<br></li><li>Con 2: Only one minifigure. As I've mentioned in other reviews I'm getting spoiled with the new sets, they all have 3+ minifigures. This one only has one, and the helmet is the stormtrooper one painted black. That's now considered old-school LEGO, but I'd rather have a real TIE helmet.<br></li><li>Con 3: As with all TIE sets of this generation is it flimsy. The wings come off very easily and the set is not very stable. This is something that has been fixed on more recent TIE sets.<br></li></ul>I gave this set a pretty average rating because it's not a bad set, but it isn't a great set. If you are a TIE collector like me then this is a must-have. I see a lot of reviews dinging LEGO for the blue on the TIEs, but I have to say I like it. It makes the ship less-sinister looking; but I will say I'm looking forward to a TIE Interceptor that's all grey and black and more solid. <br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Simple, sturdy build.</li><li>Good presence when built.</li><li>Good scale; not too small, not too big.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It really should be grey! About 60 pieces to replace to make it look good!</li><li>A little wing wobble given the design, no big gripe though.</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>It isn't much effort to switch the blue for grey, but costs quite a bit compared to buying the set. If Lego had done it in grey to begin with I'd say it was perfect for what it is.</p>",TRUE,4,2,3,4,4
