It is alot more accurate and detailed, pity this is accomplished by stickers. The minifigs are great, and so is the little bonus of the cargo tram. However, nothing is given to put into the safe-box. Beyond the junior-ised surface, this is an excellent set anyway, suitably complicated with play and displayability.

"Doctor_Sinister","2007-05-29T18:25:49.527Z","Wow - simply wow.","This is possibly one of the best LEGO sets I've ever bought.  It's a joy to put together, sturdy, super-swooshable and accurate.  It beats the old A-Wing hands down. When you look at the completed model, it doesn't even look much like LEGO at all, it looks like a moulded toy - and picking it up does little to dispel that illusion - it's lovely to hold, and surprisingly weighty - but perhaps that shouldn't be such a surprise given the density of the build.  I love the little cargo hold at the back and the engines are super-cool.  The only downsides are the front landing gear (shame) and the non-airtight cockpit, but I'm still giving this a five.

I may even buy a second one - I love it that much.

The A-Wing is the fastest fighter in the fleet, both times the B-Wing and the A-Wing models have come out in the same year. This model has a really nice streamlined design to it, which gives the impression that it is built for speed. The swiveling guns is a design trait they carried over from the last model, which is great. By the way did you know the A-Wing was originally going to be blue and white, but it had to change to dark red as it would off made the fighters transparent. Anyways onto the pro's and con's: -

Pro's: -
One off the most accurate design models

"greymav","2007-10-18T19:55:56.373Z","Wonderful set; a hard-to-find gem.","The A-Wing has been one of my favorite fictional ships for a long while, and I lucked out to find this set fairly cheaply on eBay; it is the gem of my LEGO collection, and one of the all-around best models I've ever seen.

It's fairly compact, but the ship has a nice feeling of weight to it that lets it sit comfortably in the hand; the little cargo hauler is a nice bonus, as is the driver. The ship itself is very nicely movie-accurate, right down to the swiveling cannons, and there's even a little cargo space in the back with its own swing-up cover (the rear arch of the cockpit).

This set gets an almost perfect score from me; the sole flaws are minor, and greatly overshadowed by the &quot;cool&quot; factor.

First, it lacks any moving landing gear; it's got a little stand to hold it up, but it makes the A-Wing look kind of odd. You can just take it off if you're messing around with the model, though.

Second, the fins on the back are notably less durable than the rest of the model; they're large enough to be hard to lose, though, and tend to come off in one piece if something knocks them off.

Thirdly, the set does have a few stickers. This is probably the worst aspect of the model because, well, I *hate* stickers; they're very easy to mess up, and tend to peel after awhile.

(Minor possible problem: when putting the engines together, be careful. Those little black rods can bend or break if you push carelessly.)

"Captain","2008-05-20T18:05:42.187Z","It's great, but it has a couple tiny flaws.","The new A-wing is basically the same as the old      , only it looks better thanks to newer, more streamlined slopes. It has a compartment behind the pilot to hold his lunchbox thing (which doesn't actually contain anything), which is cool, but again, the box has nothing to go in it. The figs are good, the pilot's helmet has a cool design on it and both guys have basic smiley faces, my favorite heads. It comes with a little trolley thing with a ladder attached to it, but it doesn't really do much.

My main complaints are the guns and the landing gear. The little piston/landing rig on the bottom falls off easily, and it should have been retractable. The guns are annoying because they can move up and down, and if they get bumped, you'll have to re-adjust them. This set comes with stickers, which annoys me because I don't like stickers. You can never put them on just right, and if you ever want to remove them, you have to scrub off all the hideous residue. I didn't apply the stickers.

"Jim_Java","2008-08-05T15:43:48.34Z","Maintains The A-Wing's Considerable Coolness","When I first saw a picture of the A-Wing in a book about STAR WARS, my reaction was &quot;whoa.&quot; It was sleek and cool, the perfect look for a ship so fast, I read, that the Rebel pilots often had trouble using it!
This new A-Wing carries that look into Lego bricks perfectly. Lego, in dusting off and redesigning some of their older STARWARS sets, has come out with some great improvements, but 
few greater than here. The blocky old A-Wing has been replaced with a craft that looks exactly like the one in the movie. It's dark red and white, and has two minifigs. Like the B-Wing minifigs, they aren't famous characters, but simply a Rebel pilot and what I think can be called a Rebel janitor. They both have generic faces, but their outfits (and helmets) look movie-accurate (and in the pilot's case, cool). The janitor actually comes with a little carrying vehicle to ride around on, and a ladder that attaches to the carrying vehicle. All very neat, and simple to assemble.
Then there's the A-Wing. In building terms, it's one of those &quot;layers&quot;sets where building begins at the bottom, and moves to the top. It comes with stickers to attach, and it has a cockpit for the pilot 
(complete with a readout that shows a Star Destroyer).  Behind the cockpitis a little hatch, which leads me to one of the more puzzling aspects of the ship.Like the old one, there's a little Lego &quot;box&quot; that opens up, and is stored in the hatch. What is this for? Is it part of the engine? Is it supposed to carry the helmet, in case the pilot wants to ride without one?  It doesn't matter, I guess,  but I'm having as much trouble figuring out what it is as I was having with the purple spark generator in the Episode II chase scene. (Why put a dangerous machine out in the open, surrounded by buildings?) 
That's about it, except for the guns on the ship (They don't fire, but they can rotate
360 degrees vertically) and the back of the ship (It has cool-looking thrusters in addition
to the tailfins). I'd say if you combine this and the B-Wing, they'd seriously stand a chance
of defeating the Star Destroyer.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"PaulTR","2010-12-06T15:03:29.74Z","An Instant Star Wars Classic!","<p>When I first saw this set waaaaay back in 2006, I was impressed by its sleek shape, good piece-to-price ratio, and its nice color. I got it for my birthday that same year, and after building it, I was astounded at what an amazing set&nbsp;it was, and, still is!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, this set just plain looks cool. With its sleek exterior, clever coloring, and well designed shape, its probably one of the most accurate looking SW sets LEGO has released to date.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;like how&nbsp;the designers managed to create a nice, angular shape without compromising the sturdieness of the set, which is a great plus.&nbsp;Trust me, this set looks&nbsp;much better than the old version, which was horridly mishapen and&nbsp;was a dreadful red color; however, you can't really blame the designers, as they didn't have&nbsp;a wide variety of pieces.&nbsp;My only complaint with the look of the new&nbsp;set is the innacuracy of the blaster cannons:&nbsp;they are too big, and are merely a rehashed version of the X-wing's laser cannon. Also, the inclusion of stickers&nbsp;is annoying, as many will point out;&nbsp;mine are beginning to peel after nearly 4 years of service, but that is to be expected.&nbsp;Overall, this set looks perfectly movie accurate (minus the guns) and is sure to take center stage with your other Rebel starfighters.</p>
<p>The build is a nice experience: not&nbsp;too easy, yet just hard enough for you too feel challanged. It's not as exciting as some other sets, but it gets the job done.&nbsp;I was a little&nbsp;disapointed&nbsp;LEGO coudn't find a way to put a folding landing gear into the set;&nbsp;instead, a little table-like piece (sorry, not very good with piece names)&nbsp;is included.&nbsp;However, the pieces themselves&nbsp;are a great blend:&nbsp;the ""Republic Red"" pieces and sloped white pieces are great for&nbsp;MOC builders who have a thing for the Galactic&nbsp;Republic, and the little targeting computer, locked on to the bridge of the&nbsp;SSD Executor, is a fabulous touch.&nbsp;I would recommend buying just&nbsp;this single piece off a LEGO site; its that cool!</p>
<p>As&nbsp;far as&nbsp;playability goes, this set delivers a solid performance. You can open the cockpit, take out the cargo container, mess around with the little repulser-vehicle, and swing the guns to your heart's content. The set is incredibly sturdy, and you can zip it around your&nbsp;house&nbsp;for hours without risk of damage. The minifigures are&nbsp;nothing fancy, but they look good; I'm&nbsp;very pleased they included a Rebel mechanic, like&nbsp;the previous set.&nbsp;This set is also a&nbsp;perfect opponent&nbsp;for its arch-nemesis set, the 6206 TIE Interceptor.&nbsp;And at only $16 US dollars for a whopping 194-pieces, its price is perfect! My only complaint here is that in the 2006&nbsp;Summer catalogue, the description said: ""Includes container with supplies.""&nbsp;However, there is no supplies for the container, making me feel a little sad:( I think a&nbsp;little wrench or blaster might have ""spiced"" this set up a little bit more.&nbsp;On to the pros and cons!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Great looking shape and movie-accurate 
<li>-Great pieces (Targeting computer! Yay!) 
<li>-Excellent playability 
<li>-Price is perfect for a 194-piece set 
<li>-Swooshable and a great TIE opponent

<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Guns are a&nbsp;bit big 
<li>-Stickers 
<li>-No landing gear 
<li>-Lack of accesories</li></ul>
<p>The bottom line? Get this set. I have tons of SW sets, but this one holds a special place in my heart, and just as importantly,&nbsp;my LEGO&nbsp;shelf!&nbsp;An instant classic,&nbsp;I would highly recommend this set to any true Star Wars fan!&nbsp;It gets a&nbsp;solid ""A""&nbsp;from me! ;)</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
