It contains a good selection of parts, a Minifig (2 if you count the droid) and no stickers. Playability is good with the moving wings. I agree with the previous reviewer that the price is realistic – I paid 8 GBP. Judged against these criteria, it has to rate a maximum score.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The kit was easy to complete and looks great to display alongside other Star Wars models.  The construction is solid and the overall look is very impressive.  There aren't a lot of problems with the kit, only some minor issues with dimensions and shape.  I highly recommend it for anyone with an interest in the Star Wars line.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-03-11T03:59:37.357Z","Safe and Simple Desgin that does the job","This craft, though remaining very much in the backround in Episode III, is rendered rather nicely in a simple desing that somehow packs detail as well. This set is in much the same vein as the revised A-wing released that same year. Hwever, it is difficult to pinpit the angles on the wings, since they are freely hinged. There are also no proper controls, and the cockpit is not entirely sealed in. Fortunately, the pilot's torso esign packs wonderful detail. Overall, this is quite a nice set---though more of a sputter than much else as the only Ep III set in 2006.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This model is a faithful reproduction of that ship: sturdier than it looks, it is also eminently 'swooshable'.  The only slight irritants I had with it are the gap between the cockpit and hull (understandable), and the fact that the model is next to impossible to set down flat, due to the fact that the bottom wings extend below the bottom of the hull.

All of this can be ignored however because if you like battles, this is the set for you and me.  It is light and very easy to hold in one hand, the cannons are nice, and the pilot is excellent.  This is a great combination with Anikins starfighter and vulture droid, and you can have a space battle with only $30.  If you want a republic fleet, this is the set to buy, as it is four times cheaper than the heavy, expensive, but cool ARC-170.

It's fairly durable, though; the only modification I've made to it was to move the R2 droid head to the front of the ship rather than the back.

Pros:

Fairly inexpensive, and the Clone pilot is a nice little figure; I like the sculpted helmet. The six swiveling parts are pretty nice, as well.

Cons:

It's small, and only comes with one minifig (as well as an astromech head); the cockpit has no swivel, and can only be removed by popping it off of the model (though that's easy to do.)

     This fighter gave me hours of fun. It is even more fun with a vulture droid to fight with. The wings can move in many different positions and you can think up different ""modes"" for each one. I wish this included an entire astro-droid, because it only has a head. The clone is rare today, so I am glad I have two. The build is fairly easy and fun.

Well, I got this as a birthday gift from a friend long ago. I immediatly built it and cherished that figure, who I still have today. The price is just right, I knida wish I would have gotten more of them, but at the time I didn't understand the concept of army-building. It was just, buy set, build, take apart, make own creations.</p>
<p>Figure</p>
<p>He is great! You also get a droid dome, but its not a big deal. Lego could have included a full astromech, but they chose not to. It might have upped the price I guess. Back to the fig. He looks cool, and is great if you have a ton of custom vechiles or vechiles in general, and need some piliots! </p>

<p>Ship</p>
<p>I remeber this ship in Star Wars battlefront. It was fun flying over the droid capital ship and bombing it, and it was even more fun bombing my droid army! Sadly, now the peices are mixed in a HUGE rubbermaid bucket with rope handles and countless tubs and bins where I store my store lego parts. But I just found the figure and astro head. The ship has poseable wings, a nice cockpit peice (my first of that kind) and some other neat little peices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, I would say if you find one of these in a yard sale or something, get it. I wouldn't pay over $20 for it though. Its fun to build, play with, and has a great price point. Great for army building. The new black V-wing, in my opion, is not as cool as this one. Mainly because of price difference. If you never had this set, I say get one off ebay.

The model is made up of mainly chunky elements with some angled plates, both small and large, for the nose, so there's nothing too technical or fiddly. I love the Clone Pilot, three of whom also appear in the 2005 ARC-170 set, and the Q7 droid (which is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">spherical</span>, but only the top dome is included) is great, too - the silver detailing and red-and-black colours are superb.</p><p>I also really like the canopy - it really goes well with the profile of the ship! The bright neon green thrusters also look <span style=""font-style: italic;"">seriously</span> cool, and the dark red bricks, some of which are somewhat rare, make the ship look brilliant. The guns on the side of the fighter, attached to the wings, look good too.

Talk about value for money! (back in '06, anyway)</p><h4>Cons<br></h4> While this set scores great on parts and figures, it lacks some detail. For example, there is no control panel or stick or much of anything for the pilot; just a blank white tile faces our intrepid clone. It would have been great to include a nice colourful screen or something, so that sort of detracts. Secondly, the nose is a little too flat.

"Lego_Lord_Mayorca","2010-08-24T21:12:23.393Z","The Start to the End of an Era","<p>The advent of 2006 heralded the beginning of a slow-down for me and collecting Star Wars Lego sets. After the glut of goodness that came about with the release of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; the year before, I was a bit dismayed at the early 2006 releases. At the same time, BIONICLE was stepping up the game with the release of the Piraka, and even in early 2006 I highly anticipated the summer's release of the Toa Inika and all the larger sets associated with them and the quest for the Mask of Life. It was also the beginning of the end of my high school years, and my parents were heavily discouraging my continued purchases of Lego sets of any kind, not to mention school was giving me plenty of distractions, both good and bad, from Lego.</p>
<p>But the V-Wing Fighter caught my eye. I loved how it looked to be the &quot;predecessor&quot; to the TIE Fighter in Episode III, and I was somewhat satisfied with myself at predicting it would be released soon after Revenge of the Sith came out. Naturally, sometime after Christmas in 2005, I saw it on the toy shelves of Wal-Mart alongside some the new BIONICLE sets I wanted as well. At $10, it was hardly a decision. I had to have it, and took it home promptly to build. The box it came in, I recall, was rather thin in material, and it bruised easily. Upon opening it, I tore the flaps rather badly (mind you, I was 17 at the time and a veteran of opening many Lego boxes. This kind of tear rarely happened to me). Even today, the box looks a bit shabby for such light usage.</p>
<p>Let me succinctly describe it in a word: quick. I write that with no pretensions towards negativity. In this case, I wanted to swoosh around and see how the finally product looked next to my ARC-170 and Vulture Droid. I was ready for it to accompany Anakin in his starfighter for some massive space engagement during the Outer Rim Sieges. So I was pleased to see the set go together so quickly. Thanks to the small size, there was no major repetition of building particular sections. I had to make some judgment calls as to how far I wanted to push the black rods in to create the laser cannons, but that was about it. A straight-forward, pleasant build with nothing special.</p>
<p>When I was done, I was very pleased. The overall set looks very much like the V-Wing in the movie, though I was a bit disappointed with the blunt end and flatness of the nose (I think the V-Wing has a bit more of a slant and point to it). However, I was more disappointed by the complete disregard for an actual control panel in the cockpit. Instead, there is a &quot;joke&quot; in the form of a common, white 1x2 grill tile. Haha. It's like when designing the set, it was obvious the pilot needed controls, but to spite those like me who appreciate that a lot, it was decided not to include an actual control piece, perse. I usually swap that piece out when displaying, so it is a minor issue in the big picture. Still, is Lego that nervous about including printed pieces?</p>
<p>On a similar note, I was confused by the Republic logo being behind the astromech. I had thought there would be two logos, one for each side of the craft on the nose. Also, the engines had trans-green disks to represent the glow of the engines. It was definitely NOT green in the movies, so I was equally confused. I don't recall building any Star Wars ships with green engine glows, so this one really sticks out.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, I enjoy this little set. It would be the last before battle packs completely took over the price bracket for it and ended the release of sets like this. <br />

"PaulTR","2011-06-05T21:58:51.133Z","A Cute Little Starfighter","<p>My dad bought me this set in a Walmart&nbsp;after I looked at it for a little too long (you gotta love dads :) After I finished building it, I found a little starfighter ready for action.&nbsp;A rather haph-hazardly designed&nbsp;set, the&nbsp;6205&nbsp;V-wing is&nbsp;nevertheless a nice little addition&nbsp;to any Clone Army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The V-wing starfighter is a rather simple looking set. With its moveable wings, energy generators, and 4&nbsp;lasers, the V-wing does a&nbsp;decent job of re-creating the official version's main features. I especially like the way the side wings&nbsp;look; they&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;fairly accurate comparison with the canon version.&nbsp;However, the V-wing is a&nbsp;very skinny set; the real version is fatter and far&nbsp;stubbier. The two landing stands don't help the matter, as they jut out and&nbsp;distort the lines of&nbsp;an otherwise&nbsp;decently-sleek fighter. The cockpit furthers ruins the effect:&nbsp;gaps between the cockpit and body of the&nbsp;V-wing expose the pilot to space, which is a bit odd. Oddly enough, the ship looks best when viewed from the rear; there's nothing&nbsp;overtly special about the rear, but&nbsp;the extended wings and nicely built engines give off an interesting rear profile. Still, a good-looking pair of engines can't&nbsp;cover the fact the V-wing is a rather&nbsp;skinny, oddly shaped,&nbsp;mostly innacurate&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build for the 6205 is on par with what a $10 US dollar set usually is: quick, simple, and incorporating a few interesting techniques. The body is built like a boat, with a cockpit and engine&nbsp;block compromising the rear half. The wings/laser assembly&nbsp;are then attached to the body via Technic rods. Overall, it's a&nbsp;simple, sturdy&nbsp;little build that's not really anything special. Indeed, I think it's a little too&nbsp;simple: no control panel is provided for the pilot, gaps are visible near the cockpit and underneath,&nbsp;no proper&nbsp;landing gear is provided, and the cockpit is simply clicked on.&nbsp;Now, I understand this is a smaller set marketed more as an impulse buy, but I feel the designers really skimped out;&nbsp;they could've at least thrown in a control panel for the pilot.&nbsp;However, you do get some very useful pieces: plenty of Republic Red&nbsp;angled pieces, 6 hinge and flip pieces, Republic insignia,&nbsp;long grey angled pieces, a cockpit piece,&nbsp;an R4 head, and a clone pilot.&nbsp;The clone pilot is probably the best part of the set, with his nifty little helmet and flight suit.&nbsp;So, while the build is a bummer, the parts are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 6205 is a fun little set to swoosh around. You can open the cockpit, put the pilot in, adjust the wings, and&nbsp;click the flaps around. The fighter is also sturdy enough to swoosh around in battles with Vulture droids. Besides that, though, there's not much else you can do with the set: there's no accesories for the pilot, and you can't really play with the decapitated head of the R4 droid :) Now, let's hit&nbsp;the list and see if we can find some nice things to say about the 6205.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Nice rear profile 
<li>-Sturdy build 
<li>-Nice amount&nbsp;of useful pieces 
<li>-Price per piece ratio is fair 
<li>-Swooshable 
<li>-Cool clone fig</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Not very&nbsp;Star Wars accurate 
<li>-Poorly constructed in parts 
<li>-Lack of action features 
<li>-No accesories</li></ul>
<p>So, would I recommend the 6205 V-wing starfighter? Well, that depends&nbsp;on what kind of sets you like. If you're a Republic Army builder, this cheap little set is a good way to stock up on fighters. However, if you're just an ""average"" Star Wars collector, I think you should pass it up for the newer, Imperial version. Sure, it's a&nbsp;cheap little set, but in the end,&nbsp;the poor build&nbsp;leaves a lot lacking :/&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set alone doesn't do much, but with two of them and the ARC-170 Starfighter you can build up a very impressive looking space battle display. (I have yet to aquire an ARC-170, but I do have two V-Wings to act as wingmen when I do.)</p>
<p>Building this set takes very little time and involves some interesting step-by-step construction. Once complete you have a fairly interesting looking little Star Wars Vehicle in LEGO form. This set was released before they started including the Flick-Fire Missiles however so there isn't much to play with here, except when using your imagination, but the ship is definitely fun looking and looks good in any Star Wars LEGO display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure included with this set is one Clone Pilot, but even though you're only getting one Mini-Figure with this set the Mini-Figure is a great addition. There is also the top half of an Astromech droid, unfortunatley LEGO chose not to include a bonus torso part for the top, it is the only flaw in an otherwise good set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd strongly recommend picking up this set and if you can get a few of them, they enhance any LEGO Star Wars space battle display. LEGO is re-issueing this set in 2011 with an Imperial design, looks like I'll have more V-Wings soon for my collection.

Thirdly, the cockpit on this model has no way of opening unless you just remove the piece, which isn't how a starfighter's cockpit should be removed. Finally, how does the pilot control the ship?

I had this set in 2009 and I parted the set out. Just recently though I built this set in February of 2017 and now I&#39;m obsessed with it.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>The set comes with a great clone trooper and a droid head. It also come with a lot of burgundy pieces, which you can use.&nbsp;I think it&#39;s fun to&nbsp;move the wings up and down. This set is fun to play with, but is also looks great when you display it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>I personally think there is nothing wrong with this set at all. Some may say it kinda of boring.</p>

<p>In conclusion I love this set because it was one of my first Lego Star Wars sets and it always brings back memories when playing with it. I think you should buy&nbsp;it if your a Star Wars fan and if you want a great set to display, but to play with also.</p>

Because of its low price, I took many with the idea to build a Republic fleet. Nine years after that fleet still not exist, and this ship looks outdated, with many flaws. But it has a special place in my heart.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No special part deserve to buy the entire set to get it, contrary to some microfighters today. The printed round 2x2 tile with the Republic army is quite interesting and reminds us taht before, Star Wars sets didn&#39;t include any sticker.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is only one clone pilot with a totally black head and a printed torso. I like his helmet, even it&#39;s not accurate to the Clone pilots we can see in Revenge of the Siths.</p>

<p>There is also the head of a red astromech droid. Yep, just the head...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>With only 100+ pieces, the build is really fast and not very interesting.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model suffers from two flaws : the wings doesn&#39;t fold the way they do in the movie, and there is a big gap between the hull and the canopy : I hope the pilot has a pressurized suit ! Also, next to other ships, the V-wing seems really, really tiny.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set has nothing special, suffers from many flows and contains only one minifigures, not even a complet droid. But it&#39;s still nice to get a spaceship for just few bucks, and the good thing with Lego is you can improve any model to get it right !</p>

<p>&nbsp; First off you have the clone pilot with an old clone moulded helmet. With Republic symbols on it. His torso is printed with flight gear. He has sand blue arms and legs. The astromech droid is only a head printed in dark red.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is composed of a lot of plates. The shop once complete is pretty sturdy. It looks great and will fit right in next to even the most modern LEGO Star Wars sets. It makes a great wing man for your Jedi starfighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall a great LEGO set. If you could ever pick one up I would highly recommend it.</p>

"calzonie","2022-07-01T07:01:55.1Z","Still Nearly Flawless!","<p>This version of the V-Wing is still surprisingly great! There have been&nbsp;updated versions&nbsp;since 2006, but I still feel completely satisfied with this one. The clone pilot might not be super accurate to the film, but LEGO was only working with the one mold&nbsp;for phase 2 clone helmets at the time, and the design they came up with works just fine.</p>

<p>I love all the dark red pieces, and the whole ship uses a lot of&nbsp;skinny plates, but it&nbsp;manages to feel&nbsp;sturdy, which is always appreciated!&nbsp;It&#39;s odd to see a Star Wars set that completely forgoes play features like missiles or stud shooters, but I can&#39;t say I miss them.&nbsp;It feels like a better&nbsp;model without a clunky shooter stuck onto it somewhere.</p>

<p>I only have 2 small gripes with the build.&nbsp;One is that the wings don&#39;t rotate sideways for a rested position like the later versions do, and they&#39;re too firmly attached to the ship to easily remove them without taking other pieces with you.&nbsp;But they don&#39;t cause&nbsp;a problem in practice because they still fold in far enough that you can set the V-Wing down on its landing gears&nbsp;without any issues. The other nitpick is that the cockpit leaves several&nbsp;noticeable gaps between the windscreen, the floor, and the back wall. They don&#39;t&nbsp;ruin the set by any stretch,&nbsp;you&#39;d have to hold it and&nbsp;look pretty closely to notice most of them.&nbsp;But with it being a spaceship, it seems like that might cause some issues for our pilot!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I absolutely love this V-Wing. It still holds up, even after new versions have come to replace it.&nbsp;Plus, it&#39;s stayed&nbsp;cheap enough on Bricklink that I think it&#39;s easily&nbsp;worth buying today&nbsp;if you&#39;re looking for something&nbsp;to add to your clone army.</p>
