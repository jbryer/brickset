"mynamesscooter","2005-12-17T21:15:19Z","better than i thought","i bought this set today as an early christmas present... wow. so much detail goes into building it, and the mini-figs are awesome. on to the good and the bad

Good:
- silvery metalic pieces for IG-88
- the complex structure
- lots of hidden weapons and a hidden projectile
- a LOT more detail compared to the first Slave 1

Bad:
- the projectile launcher is sensitive so it launches really, really easily but other than that i cant really find anything wrong with it

its a great set. i suggest you buy",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

It has a sturdy construction, the same cockpit design, a cargo hold, and hidden weapons.  In compareison with the movies the outside looks pretty good.  The only real flaw I could find was the fact all the hidden weapons are mixed up(exp.Boba Fett never had sonic charges). and the lack of a BIGGER cargo hold.  But hey, it's only a $50.00 Lego right?

First of all the Boba Fett minifigure is of course way sick although I was kind of hoping for the way cool looking one in the Cloud City set which I have never been able to get my hands on.  The extra bounty minifigures are cool looking although I didn't really like the idea of Dengar just having the original smiley face.  Other than the minifigures were way cool.  Alright to the ship next.  If your looking for a ship with many hidden guns and gadgets, you've come to the right spot.  Guns everywhere!  First of all its got the two turrets in front that are easy to locate and use.  Second of all the dropping bombs work extremely well, third of the hidden missiles in the front hatch are definately coolest part of the set, and fourth of all the huge missile in the fronts is extremey easy to shoot, and does not in any way have any problems.  The wings also worked extremely well when shifted alot better than the first Boba Fett Slave I.

"legoguysw","2008-03-09T09:58:34.653Z","BRILLIANT!","The last time I reviewed this fantastic set, I didn’t give it the rating it deserved. So I'm re-reviewing it. Here we go...

First off, the minifigures. A nicely detailed Boba Fett, with helmet and jetpack, sits at the controls. Dengar, another bounty hunter, has a nice head design and an oversized blaster. IG-88, the droid, is almost entirely chrome, and his head piece is nicely done, made mostly out of single studs. Then there’s the Bespin guard, who could double as Lando Callrisian easily enough. Also is the HAN SOLO ENCASED IN CARBONITE minifigure, which looks awesome! He gets his own place in the ship, more on that later.
Ok, lets start at the back of the ship. This includes 2 cool mechanisms;
1. The grey bit leading up to the entrance to the Carbon Han Solo room folds up (on click hinges). Because of this, the bombs (2 white minifigure heads) drop out. Fun to play with. Not so sturdy, but still good.
2. The Han Solo carbon brick can be slid into a small 'bed'. Turn a knob on the side, and the bed is folded up so the carbon brick can't fall out. Though you have to put it in just right, otherwise it falls through a small gap.
Working forward, we come to the walls. They are 2 studs wide, and VERY sturdy. But be prepared for long hours of fixing if you try to take them apart; the whole ship collapses. In the walls are those little 'lockers', which can fit a blaster each. You have to wedge it in just right (with the handle pointing outwards), or you won't be able to get them out after closing the lockers. The base of the ship, which sticks out, is made of sloping pieces (mainly brown), that work very well.
Next we come to the MISSILE. I was fed up of seeing these everywhere, but its been put to good use here. Again, by pushing a knob on the side, which pushes a technic rod down onto the trigger, the missile shoots out. You have to open up a bit of the roof first, to let the missile get out. This bit smoothly opens and closes. 
Behind this is the part that makes the ship look like a flying iron: the tail thing. In the part nearest to missile on this, is another opening sections. This one moves on click hinges. Again, it is very well done, and adds to the smoothness of the ship. In this secret compartment are 2 heat seeking missiles, long, brick built torpedo things, with trans-orange cone on the ends. They fold out, and end up pointing at about 45 degree angles. They come off easily when you want them to, and don't when you, um, don't. If you took the hinges they are on out, as well as the torpedoes themselves, you could fit a minifig in there. Not the most practical place, though. Behind this is another, smaller compartment, this time sealed by those large car doors. You open them up, and you can pull 2 blaster things out to a 90 degree angle. These are on standard hinges. At the very end are 2, long cannons, that spin around.
Back in front of the missile is the cockpit. This is basically a huge, free area... that only holds 1 minifig. This is because of a clever, but a bit annoying mechanism. You see, there is a small chair and computer thing, suspended up there by a technic rod, then connected to the wings outside. Lego cleverly incorporated the way the wings spin as the ship moves in the movies to the Lego version. Because the pilot seat is connected to the wings, as the wings move so does the seat, remaining upright at all times. The seat can only hold one minifig, and placing a minifig beneath will restrict its movement. So, that’s good because its realistic and bad because there’s less space.
The wings. These are nice, as i said earlier move as the ship does. Lego used lots of small pieces in this part to make a big effect. Lego used an oversized mudguard piece to make the bit that curves around the technic rod. This is brilliant. Not much more to say. 
Around the base of the ship is a bit fragilee, and some pieces easily come off. The underneath of the ship is great. Lego used curved bricks to make the booster parts, and used bright trans-orange dome pieces to form the engines. Brilliant.

CONS: (I'm not doing PROS as it would be too long)
A bit fragile.
Some parts don't work too well.
Not that much room for minifigs.

Also, this set's list of minifigs(boba fett and extremely rare bespin guard, dengar, and IG-88) is sweet! I must say that I really like the new Slave I design. Now, this set was designed mainly like the Jango Fett's Slave I except for a couple of improvements, which is why I love it! I'm so glad that LEGO kept the basic design. Yes, everything about this set is great! The only thing that I would say is bad is the fact that the construction is a little difficult as was the Jango Fett's Slave I, but it's manageable.

But i''m not really complaining, at least it came with the rare element of the white hood. The dengar is a great addition, and the cloud city guy is a decent surprise. The loading system for the carbonated Han solo is innovative, but it tends to jam easily and disconncect. The control area for boba acts like a weight when turned vertical, and his seat flips along with the rest of the ship. the latches on side of the plane contain missles, and the top trunk like section in the picture is opened to reveal a large black pointed spring missle.

"AFOSL","2009-06-20T16:31:15.687Z","Third Time's A Charm","When I first saw this kit come up for sale on the internet I had a very mixed reaction.  I wasn't too concerned over the fact that Lego had decided to release another Slave 1, although that crossed my mind.  My main concern was whether to buy it, not knowing how similar this kit might be to Jango Fett's Slave 1, kit number 7153.  Having only seen the front side of the box and a few pictures of the finished model, it was very hard to see what changes had been made from the earlier model and I was a little worried that this ship would be an almost direct copy.
I needn't have been concerned at all as this incarnation is very different from the earlier rendition and well worth the purchase.  
That's all I want to say on that as I don't want this review to become too much of a comparison between this and the earlier models.  This is an entirely brand new design.
 
The box art is very nice, up to Lego's usual high standard.  The main details are also embossed, making the presentation seem even more of a fanfare that screams, ""look at me!""  The embossed design appeared on very few Lego models during 2006, vanishing almost as quickly as it appeared.

The compact looking instruction book is actually a very thick 75 pages long and divided into 51 modeling stages, starting with the construction of the minifigures.
Apart from Boba Fett and the Han in carbonite brick, the other figures are brand new, two of which are exclusive to this kit at the time of writing.
Boba Fett is the same excellent figure as seen in most other kits it comes in.  That is to say it is not the same fully detailed figure found in the Cloud City kit from 2003.
The carbonite brick is also identical to all other previous releases.  One improvement is in it's overall assembly.  The use of a 1x2 plate with handle (Peeron 48336) finally allows minifigures to hold this piece so it can be glided to wherever it needs to go.
The three new figures are Bespin guard, Dengar, and the mentally unstable assassin droid turned Bounty Hunter, IG-88.  All are excellent additions to the minifig line up.  It's nice to see these minor characters recognized by Lego and they make a pleasant 
change from more Stormtroopers or another Darth Vader.

Stages 1 to 15 begin the construction of the ship, starting with it's entire base, using a lot of grey and brown bricks and slopes up top, before flipping the assembly over and building the very detailed underside of the ship.  Actually, at this stage (14) you will only build half of the underside with the rest being left until much later.  I'm not sure why Lego designed the build that way.
Stage 15.5 is split into 6 parts and deals with the construction of a large spring loaded piece and it's mounts.  This assembly is then attached to the main model in stage 16.
With stage 17 to 19 the stabilizer guards are fitted.  Unlike those in the previous model, 7153, these guards are properly secured and not flimsy at all, even though the same type of parts are used in their construction.  
Stages 20 to 30 deal with some inner workings of the ship.  These 10 stages are further broken down into sub stages so 10 quickly turns into a lengthy 35 stages consisting of many smaller sub structures such as cockpit, stabilizer fin sub mounts and rear ramp, and feature a lot of moving parts which utilize Technic bricks and axles.
Stages 31 to 34 are similarly broken down into smaller stages and deal with the assembly of the excellent and wonderfully detailed stabilizer fins and mountings.  Not a brick is wasted here and the whole assembly looks very mechanical and purposeful.
The following stages up to 39 deal with the outer coverings of the main body of the craft and add just a few finishing touches to the stabilizer guards.
Stage 40 then has you turn the craft over so that you can finish off the rest of the underside, fitting a radar dish and completing the assembly of the exhaust ports.
Stage 41 handles the assembly of the rear tail section of the craft and is broken down into over 20 different stages, taking up seven pages. This part of the tail includes the four main cannons, two mounted on each side.  Unlike 7153, the cannons are not mounted on a click fit swivel, being more of a free moving design.  The cannons will stay in place once set, but it won't take much to nudge one side out of alignment with the other.  This is definitely a step back from the previous model which had better mountings, in my opinion.

Stages 44 to 49 deal with the front section of the tail piece, and once again are broken down into many different stages which make the build much lengthier and interesting.  In these stages you will be building missiles mounted on hinges.  These missiles are hidden behind opening flaps.  The flaps are mounted on click hinges and prove a little difficult to open for fear of breaking the whole assembly each time.  To be honest, these missiles are not needed as they are not shown in the movie the ship was featured in.  Instead they seem to be placed there in order to keep the ship in line with it's earlier rendition from Attack Of The Clones.  It's a nice play feature for younger collectors, but surplus otherwise.
And speaking of surplus play features, stage 50 comprises the mounting of the rubber nosed missile inside it's spring loaded cannon assembled in section 15.5.  This missile first appeared for me in the Tie Bomber (4479) in 2003.  I didn't like this feature then and I don't like it now.  Being an adult fan of Lego and Star Wars, I feel that this feature takes away some of the authenticity from the model and turns a good model into a child's toy, which of course, it is.

Play features aside, this third iteration of the Slave 1 is the best that Lego have produced and actually puts right a few things from the previous model.  Scale and overall shape are much more accurate when compared to 7153, not being short and stubby like that model. The extra attention to detail is also very welcome on such an admired craft, even if it does bump up the price and make the build that bit more lengthy and complicated.  And of course, the colour palette is more authentic compared to the early and limited range of colours Lego used on their first try with 7144 back in 2000.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There are many figures in this set. You get a Cloud City guard, Boba Fett, IG-88 and that other bounty hunter whos name escapes me. You also get carbonite Han Solo which I guess you could call a minifig.
The ship itself rocks. A big improvement from the first model. It's smooth plates add alot of realism to it. But enough of detail. Action features include a bomb dropper which is activated by bending the front boarding plate. Once you put Han Solo in you can turn a piece on the side to lift the storage ramp. As with the 2nd movie Slave 1, this one also has wings connected to the pilot seat so when you lift it up, the wings along with the seat turn. Speaking of the wings, they also have incredible detail.
On the other side, there is also a lever like the one you turn to lift the storage ramp. This one, when turned, will fire a cannon (one of those big guns that are on the Exo-Toa, some Aqua Raiders sets, etc.). You also have the front guns that can swivel up and down. On the front (or top when landed) there are a few missles that are covered up by a ratcheted hinged plate.'
After that, there's not much. It's a great set. I highly, higly recommend getting this even if you already have Jango's. There's lots of gizmos and do-dads on it also with storage. This is one of the best models ever, and you should definately get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The ship can fire a missile which is pretty cool and has good range.  You can load the frozen Han in the ship using a lever.  Then pushing the gray piece at the very end up will cause two bombs to fall out.  Two empty cargo boxes are at the outside of the ship, but they are very small.

The ship also has a place where you can reveal two rockets but they cannot be fired.  The cockpit is really cool and moves as you pick up the ship.  The cockpit and wings are connected so when ship moves up the wings and cockpit also move up.
