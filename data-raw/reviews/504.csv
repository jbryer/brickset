The good thing is that it has one extra forestman figure.  The bad thing is that it's rather difficult to get a hold of.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This is next to be an army builder, because have three of the same minifigure style, the forestmen and additions. The cart is the bigger feature, have a horse connected with it, and have pieces in blue color, useful because were very used in older sets. It don't have many weapons, but some like the longbow or the sword. Another itens, like the piece that can makes the horse carries weapons or another things. It is bigger than the another carts of castle, little sets or promotional ones, but keeps in feet with two wheels and the white horse. The playability is basically  makes the minifigure rides the cart, but if used to creations or be upgraded, it can becomes bigger and will can carry more minifigures. These minifigures and the complete set now are more rare than in the year that it was released, and still useful for the new and old pieces.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chriswilson3333","2011-02-23T10:41:45.997Z","Great little army builder","<p>I got this set for my birthday about 6 mounths ago and I think it is a great set. Its main appeal is definatley as an army builder but the cart is good to. This is a good way to get three forestmen and by getting three or four of this set you can have quite a large group of forestmen.</p>
<p>If you can&nbsp;only get one of this set then I would suggest getting it for the cart and high minifig content but it is also useful as an army builder when bought in bulk.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"Heisenberg","2017-11-14T21:00:25.987Z","Three men and a hay-cart","<p>This set is a bit of a mystery. &nbsp;I don&#39;t remember seeing it in any of the Lego catalogues growing up. &nbsp;There is an American version that is similar but&nbsp;with one less Forestman. &nbsp;I knew of neither before Brickset and when I saw it I immediately wanted it.</p>

<p>They are quite hard to find, bit like a needle in a hay-cart. After a year of searching I finally got hold of a set. &nbsp;Was it worth the wait?</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>Unfortunately missing&nbsp;the&nbsp;box. &nbsp;Going by similar sets the front&nbsp;would have had the same picture&nbsp;as the instructions and the back alternative builds. &nbsp;But alas, we can only imagine.</p>

<h3><strong>The build and parts</strong></h3>

<p>Instructions are great,&nbsp;single sheet and straightforward. &nbsp;Really enjoyable build. &nbsp;This is your classic Lego experience.</p>

<p>Notable parts are the pitchfork and round shields which only came in a few sets. &nbsp;The black vine piece makes a great whip. &nbsp;Or is it the whip piece that makes a great vine? I&#39;m not sure. &nbsp;There is a great play feature built into the cart but more on that later.</p>

<h3><b>The minifigures</b></h3>

<p>Forestman&nbsp;and three of them. &nbsp;They seem loosely based on Robin Hood and are often depicted&nbsp;stealing treasure from the Knights. I presume this was to keep for themselves.</p>

<p>They have feathers in their caps and a classic smiley face. Apart from the size of the feather you can tell them apart from colour&nbsp;on their tunic.</p>

<h3><strong>Finished model and Playability</strong></h3>

<p>Great looking horse and cart. &nbsp;The 2x2 yellow bricks are a good representation of hay. &nbsp;Really looks the part.</p>

<p>This must be one of the first sets to come with both a&nbsp;story and play feature. &nbsp;You see the cart has a hidden compartment where one of the forest men can hide. &nbsp;The weapons can be concealed in the hay. &nbsp;The other two then can pretend that they are farmers transporting their hay. &nbsp;I would guess the plan is to sneak into a castle and steal the treasure. &nbsp;That&#39;s usually what they&#39;re&nbsp;up to.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall</strong></h3>

<p>It&#39;s&nbsp;a fantastic set and I&#39;m really glad to have it. &nbsp;My only critique is that it doesn&#39;t come with an enemy faction which without limits the playability so I&#39;ve marked it down one. &nbsp;However overall I can&#39;t fault it so full marks from me.</p>
