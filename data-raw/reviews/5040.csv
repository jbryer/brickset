A good airport would come with at least 5 or 6 more floors, and include food courts, fun areas, baggage claims and gift shops. There isn't even a terminal. The pieces used are terrible. Also, the hotel isn't any better. The only good thing is the airplane. After a while, I decided it wasn't worth keeping, so I took some of the 1x8 plates and built something else. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

The hotel is actually good but it would be better in minifig scale. But, it isn't and is truely awful.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
