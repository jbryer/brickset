                  Pros

                  Comes with a comic and catupult.
                  Like the armery.

                  Cons

                  Does not look like Jayko.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-02T16:27:36.84Z","Minifigure of an archer","Another minifigure from this theme, another different of the action figure, because the head, helmet and in a place of a sword, it have a crossbow. It isn't bad, because can be used for army or city maker. The details are in the light blue color, like the crossbow and the helmet, well designed to an archer with crossbow and a shield with eagle symbols. This set, like the named vladek contains five pieces, and looks like with the mini heroes collection of ninja theme, but this don't feature collector's plates or a scene and isn't packed in a pack, but in a polybag, being more cheap. Another thing to this set be cheap is because it have a normal size of minifigure, and still great, useful to any lego themes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"tye","2019-08-25T16:14:19.033Z","Nice Army builder","<p>Great for army building to build up King Mathias&#39; ranks or Jayko&#39;s&nbsp;castle Talonjay. The only thing that&#39;s odd is they gave this Jayko an old guy face. Just like with the Vladek polybag they gave Vladek a young face when he&#39;s an older guy. I swear The Lego Compnay&nbsp;had a mix up and miscommunication going on before the release&nbsp;cause both Vladek and Jayko polybags&nbsp;have the wrong type of face. This is one of the few sets where you can get a baby blue Crossbow and helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall still nice Army Builder.</p>

"asianlego","2008-09-23T12:56:59.937Z","Jayko the Blue Warrior!","I received this minifig together with 5994 Catapult in a book called 'Lego Knights Kingdom Adventure Box' which contains two polybags and a comic book based on Knights Kingdom. The minifigure itself is not bad and has rare colors for weapons and armor. The shield is superbly done with golden eagle heads sprucing it up. However I wonder why KK minifigs are color coded?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Berrus_Brickus","2010-11-15T15:19:18.917Z","Aging Potion","<p>I got this set along with a small blue catapult and a book (they were being sold in a pack).&nbsp; The book I think was just a comic with words they had in front of most of the theme's instruction booklets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> 
<li>* Rare Parts 
<li>* Goes well with other Knight's Kindom II sets 
<li>* Only comes in one other set (though there are eight of him in it)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> 
<li>* Just one minifig (though I did get a catapult with mine) 
<li>* Book wasn't very good 
<li>* Old (Jayko was supposed to be young) 
<li>* No chest armor 
<li>* Little playability with just the minifigure 
<li>* Never heard of a knight with blue armor</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude my review I will say I only gave value for money a two because I don't remember the price. Don't go searching for this unless you want a knight of the finger painting table (refering to the bright color).</p>",TRUE,3,4,1,2,2
