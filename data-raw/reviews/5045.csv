The box shows the above image, and on the back of the box there are two functions displayed: 1) The launching of Visorak out of the top, and 2) The lifting of the cliffs and the tumbling down of those rock pieces. More on both of those later. 

There aren't really a whole lot of new or attracting pieces to this set unless you really like the Visorak or Toa Hordika figures. (Which both are good, the Visorak glow in the dark which is pretty nifty, but the Toa Hordika need some work. They have tools that don't match their larger figure counterparts, and they have no articulation). There are also those rock pieces, if you like those. (And I do. :) )

The build for this set requires some paying attention to. If you try to pace up the process, you will mess up like I did. Getting those pieces placed on the base-plate is a key thing to pay attention to. 

So the set is completed, and I am excited about the functionality. I load a Visorak into the shooter, pull it back, and launch. Wow! I don't even see where it went! I look all around for it, then finally turn back to the set. I found the Visorak right were I left it: in the shooter. This happens often, and even when done right, doesn't fly very far. 

The other bad thing about the set is that it is fairly fragile. Roughing around with it even a little, will cause some things to collapse. Eventually I just got tired of putting it back together, and put it up on the shelf for display. 

There are several good things about the set, though. It comes with lots of figures, some cool accessories, and is a good companion set for &quot;Battle For Metru-Nui&quot;. Overall, taking into account the strengths and weakness, this set earns a 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
