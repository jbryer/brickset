"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T13:00:05Z","Great set","Can't really think of any way to improve it, except for maybe making the fuel tank and solid rocket boosters a little larger and truer to scale. The space shuttle is only large enough for one astronaut (included.... rare minifig!!) but that comes with the lego territory. The tower is fun to build, with unique crane-style pieces and the robotic arm and satellite are also nice features. I had a lot of fun with this model back in the day. Definitely better and more realistic than the 1995 version.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-11T19:26:34Z","2nd best shuttle launch...but a hard pill to swallow","I like this set but is only deserving of a Pros/Cons review

Pros:
GREAT SMALL set...good value if you bought it in 1990($25 where i bought it)
I LIKE THE usa sticker, but is a sticker so....
GOES well with the Discovery Kids theme today...
HAS A lift thing unlike Shuttle Laucnh Pad from 1995
Cons:
PRICE on bricklink is HORRIBLE...$55 used!!!!?!?..i can buy a Shuttle Launch Pad for $45 on bricklink and it has more minifigs and value today....

THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS SET IS THE PRICE!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Moscadini","2008-02-15T20:54:20.09Z","The First Lego NASA","I think this was a great set, but like someone set, should be put under the Discovery Sets.  Here are my Pros &amp; Cons for this set:

Pros:
NASA logos
Authentic Shuttle
Good Size
The &quot;Satellite&quot; box is just like the real one
Astronauts are great

Cons:
Stickers
No Crawler

But still...I got no problem with this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-08-14T16:53:46.937Z","Good Set to Play With","This one is not as good as the 1995 version but it is still a good set. The shuttle is very cool but looks much like a plane. The launch pad is very cool with the elevator and minifigs. This is a good set to have in your Lego town!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"davidschor","2007-08-04T19:28:45.597Z","Space Travel at Home","This set is a great example of the compromises needed in Lego towns.  The scale is off, as with most things in Lego world, but the proportions are excellent, and this set is great fun.  I am one of those folks that almost never uses stickers, so I have a non-aligned international shuttle.  I have to say, this set was a great value when released, and remains one of my favorite sets.  No Lego city is truly complete without it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"J_tje","2010-04-01T09:44:04.873Z","Great promise off things to come","This set is the first ""space shuttle"" set to be introduced in the Lego (town) series. Alltough not as good as the 6339/6544 (1995) shuttle sets it still does a great job. <br><br>The shuttle is nice, but without a landing gear and the booster rockets always attached. External Fueltank is nicely done. Also nice that the shuttle is build out of seperate wing parts&nbsp; instead of big triangles. I also like the hidden compartment near the engines.<br><br>Great (unique) feature is the lift/turnable accesspoint on the launching tower. <br><br>Set comes with 3 minifig and a vehicle + trailer and baseplate.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4
"cbowers","2011-02-04T10:39:14.427Z","A great and classic set","<p>I remember getting this set and it was awesome. The supports for the tower are great pieces and very versatile.&nbsp; I think I re-used them often as crane structures. But the great thing about this set ans sets like this are the piece count and the fact that the shuttle is all pieces and not those jumbo parts that are awkward especially in crashes...""oh hey the nose and tail survived the crash"" in ref. to the newer sets. I just loved all of the small parts it took to put this one together.&nbsp; It went great for making a spaceport as well. The only thing I remember being odd is the shuttle landing...I don't think it had any wheels. Refer to the new and improved model for changes to the shuttle, I think they were the&nbsp; launch command version in the later 90s. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, this set is really fun, and takes your city into space for further exploration. Endless play and a great build. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5

"123MrBrick","2012-03-04T18:38:46.37Z","Older Than I Am","<p>One day, I went over to my friend's house. His brother had a TON of rare LEGO sets and parts, but did not care much for them anymore. He offered to let me have some of the bins he had, and I just couldn't turn him down. By the way, this was LONG before I knew about Brickset. I carefully picked out four bins, one of which contained an old-looking spaceship. Another had a baseplate which had (what I thought at the time) a sidewalk, and the green area around it had lights made from studs and a gray platform with hoses. NOT a gas station. I looked in another bin and there it was--the red crane from this set. I looked at a bin for instructions and guess what? The very instruction manual for this set was there, and in perfect condition. Copyright: 1990! I was thrilled. This was THE oldest LEGO set I owned, older than the Mars Mission alien I found that day, older than the half of the Alpha Team suit I found. It was missing the back of the little transport, and I gave back the one worker I found to my friend, and I regretted it the minute I found out it belonged to that set, but it is still fun. I would recommend this set to any Town, World City, or City collector, especially because of the NASA and USA stickers. Love the set, one of my favorites.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
