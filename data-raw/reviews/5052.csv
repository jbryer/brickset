"Gus_263","2008-07-07T11:30:28.577Z","To hunt a &quot;mutant&quot; lizard?","This set was released in 2005, and is a small set of the Dino 2010 theme (Dino 2010 is almost the same thing as Dino attack, but the Dino 2010 sets were sold to countries different from United States, countries from Europe and also there in Brazil). This small set includes a vehicle, a minifigure, a cord with a chain at its top, and a &quot;mutant lizard&quot;, as it was called when released.

The vehicle is basic, but the color scheme (beige and red) is nice. There isn't much building involved, the long (but small) black plate is used as the base and the wheels are connected to other pieces above it. More increasements are putted in the front and at tha back, maybe to make the chassis. It have some resemblances in the building with the set 7736 (Coast Guard Quad Bike), that was released recently (at least this year), but this Dino quad is taller than the coast guard quad. But due to the size it have a problem, the minifigure have to stay in feet, it don't have space to seat, and it is a bit weird.

The wheels and of course all pieces are useful to maybe any Lego set, especially the beige and red pieces of the chassis, that are common among all the current racers theme. The building of this set is decent, the only problem is the space to put the minifigure (not exactly the space, but the position). But a good increasement makes it better than expected, the command can be reached by the minifigure, so it makes it a bit more reallistic, so cool. Also, at tha back, a circular shaped blue piece is connected to make maybe a flashlight (the blue color have a glowing variation). Not so real, but very good. The vehicle isn't a great vehicle for a small set, but still good at least.

The minifigure is common among this theme or even for any other theme. It have some details that makes it get a bit of visual stuning, but it is no problem, it is actually very cool. Also, the minifigure have a helmet (from a pilot), and a cord with a chain to capture the lizard. This accessory isn't very well made due to the piece conneting, could be better with a small stick like the lightsaber's light, but with another color, black of course. And also, this accessory flaws with the chain when it was made to capture the lizard by the neck, because it still with a long space to the chain.

The mutant lizard (very common among this theme, and with the Dino attack theme) isn't very Lego minifigure or even Lego creator like, due to the &quot;special piece&quot;(pieces without notable usability, with few exceptions) that this is made with. And also, pieces with non brick likeness) used on it. The design is good, but it is no much imaginative, so it isn't very useful as could be.

Overall, this set is good, but some other can be even cooler, due to the functions of the building. Altough it have lots of stuff in comparison with some other small sets, it don't have a great (at least for a small set) building at all. But if you want to find some dinossaur (&quot;mutant lizard&quot;) stuff, buy it (by a decent price) where you find it. It is a 4,1 of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2008-12-05T12:28:41.967Z","Yes! I got a Dino!Now what?","The Dino 2010 sets were sold in countries in europe as well as some others.I never understood why Lego had to change the weapons on the Dino Attack to pathetic nets and cages,which in my opinion was an absolutley STUPID idea.still haven't forgiven lego for it.Anyway the Dino Quad has quite a basic build but forms a nice sipmle quadbike complete with handle bars and satelite dish thing.The actual Lizard is just one big unmovable piece of plastic that you don't actually build.It also comes with a Minifigure with a large chain thing.The rope is like a whip with some chain pieces that the Dino's head is supposed to go through.
Overall a decent set that goes with other sets from the theme,but is a bit plain and looks rubbish compared to the Dino Attack sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Cause as a kid of the eighties I recognized him at first glance - this is RAMBO incarnated in the famous yellow-plastic-LEGO-style!!! That read headband and the grim face with the beard-stubbles - it&#39;s all there!</p>

<p>So all you need to do is give him some hair (like that from Frodo in 9469), some adequate clothing and the bow from Hawkeye and here we go! Rambo is ready for another mission!</p>

<p>Besides the head you do get some very usable parts in interesting colors and a rubber-moulded one-piece-dinosaur. That creature looks a little bit mutated and alien, but that is intended and works quite well in some futuristic post-apocalyptic landscapes. So altogether this is a quite useful and cheap set!</p>
