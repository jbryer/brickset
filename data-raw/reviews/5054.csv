"Kruu","2008-03-24T17:22:32.293Z","Just wanting to say it wasn't UK only","Bought this and 7294 in Croatia - Europe (but not EU), they weren't that hard to come by, complete set was available in couple of diferent stores

Set is OK, cage is to Lego Tehnic for my taste, and the staring wheeal is definetly out of place, overall not bad",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-14T14:30:15.077Z","Trap those Dinos!","This is an OK set Lego made but it has some flaws. First, the cage could be a little bit bigger. Second, is that actually a purple dinosaur? I really like the SUV with its rugged wheels and tires. I do wish it had a gun or something which would make it better. This isn't bad, but has some flaws.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"guildfordmatt","2009-01-11T10:02:08.403Z","I love it but....","<p>Great idea&nbsp;I do really like it but it has floors.</p>
<p><br/>Pros:<br/>3 dinos. These aren't great. They're just one piece of rubber that can not be recognised as Lego.<br/>Big 4x4 <br/>Easily adaptable (I put a floor on the back so it became a troop transport)<br/>Millitary colours<br/>Winch works well.</p>
<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>No&nbsp;doors&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very very wide<br/>Chicken legs are good but need to be completly round, so they don't have the anoying prong round the back that minifigs hold onto.<br/>Needs a weapon of sorts.</p>
<p>Stickers<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Good but prepare to edit. However&nbsp;I&nbsp;still love it.</p>
<p>P.s. I have no idea what has happened to the paragraphing of this review.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,5,5
"Z_wing","2009-07-19T07:33:06.403Z","do I see a mistake in the picture?","no, I see 5 mistakes in the picture. they are...
1. the dino in the cage is green when in the set it is black
2. the handles for the chicken drumsticks are too close together
3. there is no sticker where the winch handle is
4. the ""ripped paint"" sticker on the bonnet is facing the wrong way
5. the white 1x4 tile pieces are red in the set
these mistakes in the picture should not effect the pros and cons of this set

figure
pros: the figure is rare
cons: none

dino 4WD trapper
pros: winch system works well, ramp blades fold up, roof come off to seat the figure
cons: the sticker which is missing in the picture (see mistake 3) comes off when the winch handle is used
WARNING TO ALL STICKER HATERS: this set has stickers

cage
pros: can be pulled up on to the dino 4WD trapper, has a opening door
cons: none

pieces
pros: chicken drumsticks, radio, helmet
cons: dinos cannot fit on lego surfaces
