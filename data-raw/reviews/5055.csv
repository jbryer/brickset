I throw out cage and add a storage area and some other things with some other additional parts. Now it looks better than the cage. I suggest that you should also throw out the cage and add some other things according to your imagination.

Features: lowering staircase, mini-gun, rolling tracks and that's it! The cage is boring(even though you might want to break it apart if you imagine the T.rex escaping!), but the T.rex makes up for the cons. Hang on... on the picture they built it wrong! One of the long slopes is built too far back, blocking the entrance!

Pros:

Minifigs
T.rex has posable limbs and red eyes(when you press the button on the back of the head)
Big tank

Cons:

Not many features
Cage is boring
The ""pin"" holding the cage to the tank falls off a lot
The picture has building errors

Overall, not a great set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The treads on this sometimes have issues working on solid ground but on carpet they run fine. However, once again the tank has nothing to defend itself with and if the t rex gets away they have no way to stop it. The cage also looks quite awkward itself, dont even use it",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
