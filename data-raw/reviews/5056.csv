So I helped him build it for a bit and then after a while I had to go and he gave me the T-rex out of the blue. I have to give it a 5 because it was fun to build (or at least the bit that I built and it earned me a free light up dinosaur.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Munching_on_Monsters","2012-01-11T20:39:54.927Z","Jurassic Park eat your heart out!","<p>Hello! This is my first review so hopefully it'll be ok :). First of all this thing is...HUGE! Seriously, its 61cm long and has a wingspan of 52cm, so probably Legos biggest helicopter!</p><p>Now a few facts, it has just over 700 parts, some of them being big panels, 4 minifigs, 2 dinos (T-rex and a Pteradactyl), a cage and a lil' trike. Also, as mentioned on the other review of this set, there are 2 different themes dino attack (USA) and dino 2010 (Europe), dino attack is the same sets only instead of capturing them, the dino team are trying to blow them to bits, like the equivalent to this set is the t-1 typhoon which, I will say, looks pretty cool with all the guns. Dino 2010 is about capturing them, no guns just cages, but the sets are the same base models just modified :)</p><p><br></p><p>Now the review--</p><p><br></p><p>Helicopter: It has 2 cockpits, both of which pop-off to access the interior which all things considered, isnt much just a control panel, and for seats, the co-pilot has a seat, the pilot gets the floor with a toolbox behind him, on the outside there are many stickers, which I know some of you hate but I dont mind them and they do add a certain detail to it :), theres a tow winch/cable that one of the dino team can use to reel in the pteradactyl, theres a fuel tank which looks pretty cool, a satelite/radar dish which is adjustable, a couple of storage boxes either side and in centre area theres a swivel chair and radar, space to hold the net and various places to hold radios or binoculars or whatever, and on the side,theres a knob that when you turn it, it moves a mechanism which drops down a hook to grab onto the cage so you can fly the captured T-rex away:) theres also landing gear which cleverly folds away.</p><p>(Take a breather, this is quite a long review :D)</p><p>And behind the centre, theres a space which holds in the trike using 2 pipes and a clip which grabs onto it. not much about the tailfin, has a cleverly designed rear-propeller and a genius use of hinges :)</p><p><br></p><p>Dinos: Well, the T-rex first, and shes a beauty, or he even you never know , but he/she is impressive, I know we'll make it a she, nice colour scheme of red and black, she has a button on the back of her head which makes her eyes and tongue light up, and movable joints (legs, arms neck). Teeth are very well done, yellowed and sharp. Shes big too 30cm+ peak height! The Pteradactyl is also cool,&nbsp; mouths opens and shows some very menacing teeth, good colours of green and black, and nice wings and legs, both of which, like the T-rex, are movable. Although both dinos are good they dont really look like lego, apart from the 2x2 brick on their backs, thats about it!</p><p><br></p><p>Cage and Trike:The trikes a nice colour, matching the colours of the heli, only feature really is the little radar on the back, but in general a nice addition to the set :)<br></p><p>The cage is a nice design but, imagine a big, brutal, angry T-rex, and you've captured it in the cage, and all you need is something to hold it in with, what would you use, a dinky little chain or something a lil tougher? well all we get is 2 dinky chains but what the heck, still love it! Both the sides fold up and are pinned together at the top, and the front folds down to let the t-rex enter or leave.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Final bit, The Dino team: there are 4 of them and they are unique to dino 2010/attack, but man are they cool! I love their rugged, faces and their cool torsos with things like ropes and daggers on them, they're just plain cool! I also like their helmets, not rare but they are very nice indeed :)</p><p><br></p><p>Last few notes: Very cool set, I recommend this set to anyone who collects dino sets, likes dinosaurs and lego, or is looking for some unique figs and dinos :)</p><p>&nbsp;For a first review.........very long :) Hope it helped and have a good lego year :D<br></p><p>Munching on monsters<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
