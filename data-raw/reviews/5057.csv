"Obi_Wan9994","2008-06-16T17:19:42.903Z","Off to Sea","This was a really nice set. It came with two knights in armor, red and green(forgot their names), and they were equipped with swords and shields. There was lots of space, so you could upgrade this set with any other mini figs. the front of the boat has a thing that can lower(forgot it's name)that lets your knights run to battle. The catapault was okay, but it wasn't bad like a number of special features on other sets. You also get lots of cool pieces that go well with other sets. This isn't hard to build, and it doesn't take much time either. I got this in the combo pack, so i saved money, but it's worth the price by itself",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bamaker","2008-11-13T09:54:18.92Z","Fun set, but has one obvious omission","I just got this set off eBay for about $8.00 and it took almost no time to build.  The catapult works really well, and I thought the landing ramp was extremely well done - it's an Attack! Barge!.  There is also plenty of room to put about 5 or 7 other knights in the barge.  So lots of bonus points for those features.  However, after looking at the barge, I noticed there is no propulsion method on the barge -- no oars, no paddles, no sails of any substance.  How did the thing move through the water?  A little modding will fix that, but it is an obvious oversight on the design team's part.

Pros:
Quick build
Catapult works very well
Landing platform
Plenty of room for other knights

Cons:
No propulsion system",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-11-14T00:28:06.09Z","Medieval Landing Craft","Like the title says, the barge is designed like those landing crafts the army uses nowadays.. which is pretty cool. It comes with Sir Rascus and Sir Santis. There is also a tiny catapult which design and build is unique to the catapult we usually see. The lanterns on the command deck above is really cool, it reminds me of those awesome Japanese lanterns. Now I no longer use the boat for transporting knights.. I use it to transport 4-wide cars. Nevertheless, a great concept! I wish the boat could be made longer and wider.

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art on this set, while quite basic, does the job of showing the set very nicely. The catapult and dropping gate on the front of the barge show the play features really well. I felt the scale of the picture seems reasonable when compared to the finished article too.</p>

<p>The instructions were very easy to follow, but some of the colour of the print was quite different to the parts, fortunately there aren&#39;t the subtle shades in this set that require massive accuracy. A great little feature of these sets are the little comics in the back of the instructions. Very quirky, with a hand drawn feel that some might find a bit unfinished looking, I thought showed a great style.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts are fairly standard and mostly in grey. However there are a few interesting blue pieces, I am not an expert on parts, but the shade of blue used in this set looks like none of the blues from more modern sets that I own. Also the structure at the rear of the boat has two pieces that would be very useful for building castle turrets. Also the flags were on a printed plastic sheet rather than a fabric, this means they sit very nicely on the finished model and I assume have a better lifetime.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures were really what bought this wave of the Knight&#39;s Kingdom theme to my eye. The brightly coloured&nbsp;knights, who are all named, which gives a great bit of character focus to the theme. I&#39;m sure that plenty of people would see them as very childish in design, but I love them, far more interesting than other castle themes which simply have generic looking knights. If ever I manage to set up a massive display I want to do a fantasy Castle/Medieval type set up and intend to use as many of these knights as possible over the more generic types.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very basic, alsmost entirely stud on top building, but I actually really enjoyed putting it together. It&#39;s a very logical and very stable build, the only parts that there is risk of being loose are the two small flag poles near the rear but the rest is very good.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I wasn&#39;t sure if this set would be used for parts or kept for later display, but it actually made it&#39;s way onto my small display shelf. I don&#39;t know quite how long it will stay there but it&#39;s certainly won a nice little place in my Lego world.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fantastic set, I can&#39;t stress enough how much I love it, and I was only expecting to like it when I bought it. I wouldn&#39;t pay over the odds to get it on ebay, but i have noticed that quite a few end up on nice price points on auction. Worth keeping an eye out for!</p>
