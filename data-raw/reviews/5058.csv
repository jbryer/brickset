No Stickers! Now playability is limited due to the lack of a good knight but I have others so that doesn't bother me. It is also the cheapest way to get Lord Vladek.

Pros:
Cool detailed Castle.
Guard and Lord Vladek. 
Shiny helmet for guard.
Castle drops lava peces
Boat with evil flag.

Cons:
No Good knight.

I wouldn't get this as a starter set but if you have some sets already get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-02-05T18:01:40.577Z","Good small Fortress but needs other sets","<p><strong>Overall 3 bricks</strong>: It is a nice set, definitly a scary little Fortress with some great parts but it needs other sets. You have no opposite Knights, so when you finished building it it is done. So when you buy it prepare to get other sets like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8801-1"">The Knights Attack Barge</a>&nbsp;or like I did combine it with the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8876-1"">Scorpion Prison Cave</a>&nbsp;with as result a nice big Fortress. But the single set is just a nice building with 2 good mini-figures.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong>: Building this Fortress is not a great challenge, you have way too much big wall parts in this set. And even a lot of the small parts are big in this set. Even with the parts all mixed up it takes a more experienced builder a&nbsp;maximum of 30 minutes to finish this.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong>: this set offers a lot of nice parts you can use to make yourself or use with a great castle or other fortress. The grey walls and brown rock part, the stairs and the boat. The tower parts and top, the hinges and plates and of course the 2 frightening Shadow Knights. The Shadow Knight on the boat has a great shield.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong>: this is in average for the set on his own being 3 bricks and when you use it with other sets like I mentioned in &quot;Overall&quot; when it would get 5. Since most people who own this will have more sets of the theme I go for the middle being 4 bricks.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks</strong>: Writing this <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=8802-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average of &euro;32,00 which is in my opinion too much for this set, considering you built it very easy and it needs more sets for a good playtime. I think an average&nbsp;price of maximum &euro;25,00 would be more in place.</p>
