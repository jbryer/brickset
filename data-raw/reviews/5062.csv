You get 9 mini-figures, they are, a chef, construction worker, a &quot;kid&quot;, gas station guy, police, fireman, a train worker, and Santa!  None of these figures are new, or a woman, but still wonderful.

Every 2-3 days you get a new guy and what they carry around, it's great fun for children of all ages, even adult children.  :)  And there are so many little cool parts like axes and dogs, a safe with jewels, a skateboard, pizza, brooms, and so much more!

I think this is the best Advent Calendar Lego has released.  It has 203 parts, 9 mini-figures, and only cost $15.  The 2006 set is also great for $20 you get over 250 pieces and 9 mini-figures.  However the 2007 set is $25, and you get less pieces and TWO less mini-figure!  THERE IS NO SANTA IN 2007!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
