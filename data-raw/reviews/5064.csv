Some of the harder to find newer colors are in this tub. How often will there be a 50th Anniversary Tub - only once. Good set to get.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2008-10-13T22:05:42.64Z","Nice parts","This set has a lot of good parts in it especially the gold bricks which I got it for. There are lots of other cool pieces in it too that, like already stated, are in some nice,rare colors. Over all good parts and a great way to get that little imagination flowing.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legocollector","2008-12-01T18:04:34.06Z","Very Nice","I think this was a great lego tub to own. This set comes with 1000 pieces. This is great! I also like that 5 golden bricks came in the inside. Now, this set is even worth more than $20 USD (What I paid for it). I would of recommended that you have ordered this when it came out in stores.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
