There is lime green to mention on of the colors. It was limited offer, I also picked up the 1000 piece tub also. Don't really have enough Gold bricks to do anything creative with except use them as highlight's in buildings and cars. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

And I love the gold pieces. You get a bunch of ideas from the front, like this ship I built. I can't say much, but I LOVE this.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"woodall_aidan","2011-05-17T10:47:53.107Z","awesome gold bricks","This set is cool for absolutely one reason: the gold bricks. All the other bricks are cool and mostly okay, but the gold bricks give it a 50th anniversary look. The gold basic bricks are also good for the limited edition because they don't come in that many sets, which is cool. This set gets a 5/5 for gold bricks.<br>",TRUE,5,1,3,4,4
