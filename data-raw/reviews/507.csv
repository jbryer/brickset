<p>Ever since I saw the box image for this set, I wanted it. &nbsp;There was something so different about it: a part of the Lego world you wouldn&#39;t expect to see. &nbsp;In this world of police, fire, trains, airports, and quaint town life, suddenly you have what looks to be a top-secret, private, almost mercenary-like organization for running money undercover over land in in the air. &nbsp;And now that I own the set, it certainly delivers, with secret compartments and slick color schemes. &nbsp;It&#39;s a lot of fun.</p>

<h3>Building Experience: 3</h3>

<p>There&#39;s nothing particularly special about the building of this set. &nbsp;The truck is a truck, the helicopter is a helicopter, and the plane is a plane. &nbsp;Still, there&#39;s nothing wrong with it either.</p>

<h3>Parts: 4</h3>

<p>One of my favorite aspects of this set is the color scheme. &nbsp;The blacks, yellows, and reds are uncommon in the Town setting (at least for these types of models), and the addition of two radios, six suitcases, and a bunch of coins makes for a nifty set.</p>

<h3>Playability: 4</h3>

<p>The playability is where this set really shines. &nbsp;Both the helicopter and the plane have secret compartments for the luggage (though the helicopter&#39;s is just a spot behind the pilot&#39;s seat), and with the three minifigures and the truck, there are no shortage of possibilities for covert transportation missions (or legitimate ones, if you prefer).</p>

<h3>Value for Money: 4</h3>

<p>I bought this set on eBay for 15 dollars, which I understand to be a great bargain. &nbsp;Given the pieces you get and the scope of the possibilities with the set, I think it&#39;s a great value for the money.</p>
