"Sebastian","2013-06-25T09:23:13.27Z","Good set for the KKII era.","<p>I just finished rebuilding this set after it had been stored in parts boxes for about eight years. I had just got back into Lego one year before it was released and did not really like it at the time. I was all nostalgic about classic castle and just found everything that concerned Knight's Kingdom very distasteful. However, I wanted to buy some of&nbsp;the then contemporary sets to support TLC and to feel like an active member of the AFOL&nbsp;scene&nbsp;and tried to pick the best out of the bad, so to speak. The set consisted of two separate boxes, one for 8801 and the other for 8802 that were both shrink-wrapped.</p><p>So, after having revisited the set today and neglecting the fact it is KKII and new grey, I think that the two models are actually quite good. The bad guys' fort is a neat little structure with two black doors. The only downside is that it misses another hinged wall to give it a more enclosed feel. You also get a small boat, sadly without oars, one Vladek and a soldier.</p><p>The jellybean knights' attack barge easily reminds one of a modern military landing boat. It is very unusual that the designer used grey parts, as those resemble stones in my mind. A boat built with stones? Come on...&nbsp;This was also one of the reasons I did not like that model of the set when I got it. However, if you imagine the grey is not stone but painted wood in that colour, the model looks nice. It is a substantial vessel, built in eight-wide and I like the inverted slope structure. The lion flag and banners are juniorized but not too bad. The bow is nicely done, too, using two specialized big slope parts. Without any SNOT techniques used, the boat appears basic but it has just enough details not to be boring. </p><p>Both models are&nbsp;fun builds and I think this package is just&nbsp;the best you can get from Knight's Kingdom II. It&nbsp;was also the forerunner of the great 7029 Skeleton Ship Attack which was released two years later, only with reversed sides (good guys, fort/bad guys, boat).&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
