"Bran_don_jin","2006-11-10T20:07:08Z","Nice value pack!"," This is a very nice set. The fact that it comes with the ARC-170 and the tri-fighter is great, you can have real episode 3 dogfights with them. The ARC always wins of course, I like it better. The tri fighter is O.K, I like the buzz droid but the overall ship is kinda boring. The ARC is very impressive though. The bomb dropping mechanisum is great and so is the opening cocpits. The wings open VERY slowly which is a big flaw but other than this nothing bad. Great set!!  5/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It comes with an awsome mini arc-170 fighter or anakins fighter, a poster and a star wars clip for the computer, its called revenge of the brick.But the wings can get really hard to put together.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-04-29T18:55:39.467Z","Really Nice","If you didn't own the Tri Fighter or the ARC-170, this is the set for you. You get both fighters for a great space battle. It also comes with a mini model, CD ROM, and a cool poster. A 5 out of 5 for effort that Lego put into this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
