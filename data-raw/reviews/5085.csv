OK so back in the day the minifigs were basic, the cars even more so, but I must have had countless hours of fun with this set.

I even used all the 'Taxi' sign on my other cars to get my own taxi company.

Ahhhhh, memories :) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was pretty basic, but very fun. The standard style of layering bricks to make walls and windows, plus the roof is really all you have to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts are very nice. Several colors and no stickers. All emblems are painted pieces, and the Shell logo on the gas pump is actually engraved in the piece. The people are the very old style minifigs with no features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has lots of playability for a younger fan with the taxi cab and the garage with doors. The cab is too small to put a minifig in, and the front door is also too small for them to fit through,&nbsp;but that's a minor complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is an outstanding addition to anyone's Lego City, even today. It just adds something that's very unique and that every real city would have. </p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
