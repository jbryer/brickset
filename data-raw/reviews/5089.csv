My grandparents mailed this set to us in the US from Denmark back in the early 1970's, when I was not yet 4 years old.  The box and instructions and several pieces are long gone.  The best features are the archs over the wheels and the 5x3x1 opening door that Lego has begun incorporating into newer sets - the 2006/2007 Ambulance set has 2 of these same doors.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
