At the time, we had a fairly wide range of sets, with around 50-60 minifigures in total.</p>

<p>Our usual Lego play at the time was to construct enough vehicles (from sets, the Ideas Book, or our own imagination) to transport all the minifigures along the roads (ie the paisley-like swirls in the carpet pattern) in a convoy. Road vehicles, spacecraft, helicopters, horses - all took their place, and damn the health and safety consequences of riding on top of vehicles or clinging to ladders.</p>

<p>The Dump Truck, therefore, was a welcome addition. As its cabin pre-dated the standard design which enabled a minifigure to sit inside the cab, the driver of this vehicle simply sat on the cab roof. The rear section was big enough to seat several passengers, or one tired horse.</p>

<p>Broken up and used to make a new creation, the parts were simple enough to find their way fairly quickly into new items, with the articulated unit, the hinge, and the headlights brick being particularly valued. And a quick build if you wanted the original vehicle back.</p>

<p>Overall it definitely wasn&#39;t the most exciting Lego vehicle we had, but it proved itself to be a practical choice in both its full build and component parts.</p>
