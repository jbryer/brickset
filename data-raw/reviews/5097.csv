The main joy was finally having a set of lego wings and a tail fin - these could be fitted to aeroplanes, spaceships, etc.  My kids still have the wings in their general lego box and use them today, in fact they have all the bits except the tail fin which they broke :-(

The kit also had a lot of useful flat pieces which were hard to come by in Legoland sets back then!

The worst part of this kit was the wheels, they were flimsy and all snapped or become such a loose fit they would fall apart. But while they lasted they were good for converting other Legoland cars into Reliant Robins and making motorbikes!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
