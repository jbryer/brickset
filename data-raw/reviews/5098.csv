"BrickPiet44","2008-12-30T06:02:47.577Z","Nice little police set with the early mini figures","One of the sets with the early mini figures. The white belt with the black torso and legs work well for a police man.

The police van has opening doors one the back, which actually are hatches from windows.

The motor uses the then new single wheels to create a motor with a side car. For putting the police men on the motor you need to take the mini figures apart and put the torso on top of the motor bike, and the legs under the motor. The police man in de side car can only use his torso, but where do you leave the legs of this police man?

On the whole a very nice little set, that can be of use in any Legoland town.

You are able to build a police&nbsp;motorcycle with a side cart and a police&nbsp;van that includes openable doors in the back. &nbsp;You get three printed bricks, two with police and one with headlights and a front grill. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The only issue that I have is that in the police van, the minifigure is unable to fit in the vehicle. Otherwise, this set is a Police Classic.&nbsp;From the black and white bricks to the early introduction of the minifigure this set is a great addition to any AFOL&#39;s LEGO collection.&nbsp;</p>
