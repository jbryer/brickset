"T79","2016-08-03T09:34:49.443Z","Tiny Turbo avant la lettre","<p>Next to the the big trucks (cfr. #382 Breakdown Truck and Car and #383 Truck with Excavator) Lego also had vehicles in a smaller scale like this one. It&#39;s probably from these little vehicles that the cars in minifig scale evolved as the first minifigures came with such small cars, for exampe the ambulance in #363 Hospital with those early, static minifigures&nbsp;or even the car in #377 Shell Service Station with the minifigures&nbsp;we still know today.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve never had these as it came as a hand-me-down (I did not even know I had this set), thanks to the wonders of the internet my children are the first to see this set built in over 30 years. If I even had had a photo I would have been able to build it though, instructions are really superfluous here.&nbsp;But back when I was a kid all you had once you lost the box and the instructions was a tiny picture in the yearly catalogue, and since I only started getting those in the eighties I never even had a picture of this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A few plates and standard bricks, an early, smaller windscreen&nbsp;and three wheel bricks (one with single tyres and two with double tyres, I was always quite partial to these tyres but I never liked these wheel bricks as much as the wheel plates). Nothing exceptional, were it not for that blue tipper bucket,&nbsp;countless factories have been built around this part through the years (although we could have used some more of those)!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As mentioned already, this is just too easy. I do like how the fuel tanks are created by leaving a small gap between plates, but the tipper bucket is just resting on two 1 x 2 bricks, so if you even slightly tilt the truck to the side it falls off which gets a bit annoying. I like to think the solution I had worked out as a kid (I never knew the &#39;official&#39; connection as used here) was better, by resting the ends in the hole of a 1 x 2 technic brick the bucket could not fall off.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a small truck, you can&#39;t go wrong with that as far as young boys (5 &amp; 6) are concerned. And it can be used alongside those newer,&nbsp;flashy Tiny Turbos as a vintage truck (or even next to your Matchbox cars, I&#39;ve seen it happen) so really, it does its job and it does it well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When we built all sets we have with 21&nbsp;to 25 pieces and I let them have only one set, this one was <em>almost</em> taken over all others! Though in the end they went with #6806 Surface Hopper, I was still quite&nbsp;surprised to see this set from 1974 being chosen over many a more recent set...</p>
