Considering the set is 37 years old I can't find any weak points on this set, overall definitly 5 bricks like almost all aspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building is not difficult but great fun, after cleaning all the bricks I started with the building itself with mostly bars and some smaller bricks and some bows. Esspecially the bows give the building a great design. Nice work with a lovely result, a good detail in these older sets are the marks on the baseplate.&nbsp;After that the big and the small crane and the tipper truck which was not too difficult too. All in good proportions compared to the building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the normal building parts a still great working track for the gravel and the big crane with a good grabber&nbsp;running on the rails and can turn in all ways. Good hinges to make the small crane function too. Great base plate with blank spots to park and load the truck and a blank spot for the storage of gravel or bricks, splendit !!&nbsp;A compliment for the choice of colours is in place too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks too, if I was still a kid I can imagine the fun this set would give. I'm sure that my 5 year old son won't allow me to sell this set on short notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money the maximum of 5 bricks again. Bricklink shows no average value but it is for sale starting with €40,00. I found it on the Dutch eBay site and bought it for €25,00 so the 5 bricks for me are well in place, if I sell it again it will not be below €50,00.</p>
