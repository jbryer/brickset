<p>The hull is made from eight stud long sections that click together; a bow, a stern and three central sections.&nbsp; Each section is hollow and watertight, and so each section provides buoyancy which is immune from flooding.&nbsp; The set came with a weighted keel with studs that can be clicked on to a row of anti-studs on the bottom of each hull section.&nbsp; When the keel is attached the whole boat is surprising sea worthy.&nbsp; Even though I can&#39;t find it on the Brickset data base, you could even buy a battery powered motor with a propeller and a rudder that you could click onto the bottom of the boat behind the keel to allow the boat to run through the water.&nbsp; The bow section also has a loop that string can be attached to so that the boat can be pulled through water.</p>

<p>The ship&#39;s superstructure is built on top of the studs on the deck surface of these hull sections.&nbsp; The superstructure is not overly elaborate by modern standards, but looks quite cool in its depiction of a pre-containerised cargo ship.&nbsp; This set probably had the most elaborate of all the 1973 boats and was the longest.&nbsp; The hull sections can be rebuilt to make a ship of any length, only restricted by the number of hull sections you have.&nbsp; You can then build any superstructure you like on top of your hull. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The sets came with stickers, that represented portholes, anchors and some &#39;Legoland&#39; branding.&nbsp; From memory the stickers where like the decals that you would apply to model aeroplanes.&nbsp; You soaked them in water and then slid them off the cardboard on to the model before allowing them to dry.&nbsp; The interesting thing about these stickers is that, despite spending a lot of time in the water in the 1970s, these stickers still look brand new today.</p>

<p>This boat allowed children to build boats of four different lengths (0, 1, 2, or 3 central sections), and build whatever superstructure they wanted to on top.&nbsp; Any boat you make with this set will float, not risk becoming flooded, and stay upright (thanks to the keel).&nbsp; The stickers can be immersed in water without damage.&nbsp; What Lego boat since then has offered both the flexibility of future builds and the play value in water that this set offered?</p>

<p>A great set.&nbsp; These 1970s boats were brilliantly designed toys for children.</p>
