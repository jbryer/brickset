"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-07T07:13:07.733Z","Sweet Childhood Memories!","I loved this set!  I played with it for years but unfortunately there are not many pieces left now.

It is a fantastic set for girls (I know that is sexist but it's true).  Each person could be assembled in a few ways and it was easy to follow how to build them from the box - from memory there were no instructions.

Grandma could stand up or sit down by rearranging the bricks in her skirt and the 3 adults had long arms whereas the kids had short stubby little arms (no elbows).  The hair was reversible, one way for dad, one way for the boy etc.

The people are weird and even as a kid I remember preferring the mini figures but I'm guessing when these where first made there where no mini figures.</p><p>I have fond memories of this set even though a bunch is sadly missing now (I still somehow have all the hands) but don't go buying this for your kids to play with. As a collectors item or a momento its cool but most kids would have more fun with a few cool minifigures&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,2,1

The constructed bodies and flexible arms allowed a great degree of pose with turnable heads set in to their bases. The blocky unmovable lower half did little for action but allowed a layer by layer design structure upwards to express what the person might be wearing.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a great starter set for maxifigures and the mentioned high points are printed pieces that succeeding in adding just enough character while remaining adaptable. It raises the point yet again that the more fancy, detailed and individual a (face) print is made, the less interchangeable and reusable it becomes. Imagination can fill any gap left by figures that were designed to be inherently basic and are ever more evolving in to more textured and detail painted characters, so removing choice from play. This merely observational criticism is aimed at modern minifigures that may be great for the individual collecting quality but so much less so as inventive multi-use design elements.</div><div><br></div><div>I would mention the hands as a favourite piece for their longevity of use, strange as they are, unique elements that make handles, light bulbs, lamps, food, signs, door knockers among anything you can think of. I have only seen these in yellow but the pivoting effect makes these people very much like plastic brick dolls ready for a house and furniture and considering their size, the possible building outcomes for them are very extensive which is a plus.</div><div><br></div><div>The 1974 packaging and photo suggests so much innocent play, its good that such toys are held on to and I would encourage all of us not to be too precious about old toys of quality that could provide something for our kids that modern hype and overblown plastic fads may not.

"Niki124","2021-02-01T22:58:43.24Z","My first Lego","<p>I believe this was the first Lego set I ever owned, I think it was bought for me for Christmas shortly before my third birthday.</p>

<p>I suppose it was a noble attempt to introduce Lego bricks to young children in an approachable way, but even at that young age I found it rather limiting. I recall noticing how the boy/man&#39;s hair and girl/lady&#39;s hair was the same piece but turned around, which I thought was quite clever, but it was not enough to redeem it in my eyes. You could make them all join hands and dance in a circle, but that was about it - and I recall being told not to make the grandmother stand up for too long.</p>

<p>My main present for my third birthday was a large basic Lego set, and a few years later my sister and I dived into the golden era of minifigures. The general-use bricks from this set were re-used, but I recall seeing the heads, hair over their faces, occasionally surfacing from the sea of assorted bricks in the large containers. They were never to feature in a build again.</p>

If your a little kid I wouldn&rsquo;t advise getting this as it&rsquo;s not for playability and minifigures&nbsp;are better but if like me your a collector then get this set soon.</p>
