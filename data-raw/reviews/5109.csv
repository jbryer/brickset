That said, it's hard to fault the kit for the size of the primary model.  The overall design is fairly solid and the working harvester on the back works brilliantly.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Skafte","2007-08-16T03:09:55.38Z","Cute little vehicle","The tractor is small, but brilliantly constructed. I'm not much into Technic, but a couple of friends gave me this model, welcoming me to &quot;the dark side&quot; (they have everything Technic). It works well as an introduction to gears and levers, but I guess younger builders might need a hand. It is vital to get everything exactly right for it to work, and the instructions are not elaborately detailed.

There is also an alternate model in a second booklet - a motorcycle with sidecar. This is also a great model and adds a great deal to the value of the set.

Do get this set, but don't expect it to get any real harvesting job done - it fits in the palm of your hand!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
