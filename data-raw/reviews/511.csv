That means I discovered where my Blacktron 2 Mini-Figures came from. Multiples of this set, and the reason for finally figuring it out is because of those little arrow plates attached to the wings. Plus those fancy connector pieces for the&nbsp;control panel, not to mention I still have a set of those wing plates in my spare parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what can I say about Galactic Scout? I guess the only really great thing about this set is that it offers up a lot of fun little pieces whose uses are endless, I've used those spare parts again and again in MOC builds. Plus I really liked the Blacktron 2 Mini-Figures, so much so that I must have begged and pleaded to get two of this set. Sadly I don't have it anymore, but perhaps one day soon I'll pick it up again along with the rest of&nbsp;the Blacktron 2 sets that I always wanted to own. (Blacktron 2 and M-Tron, both Sub-Themes that I've always wanted.) If you want some pieces to MOC and some Mini-Figures of Blacktron 2 Mini-Figures then this set is a great source of troop building and I recommend it. (Even though it features only a few pieces.)</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>Although small this little craft shares the moving wings with the 6832 Nova II which is nice&nbsp;given this is a simple build. The bracket seat allows the minifigure to sit with his airtanks on and the back features a rocket nozzle. The designers could have so easily used a 2x4 sloped brick for the nose but its nice to see they thought outside the box and used two&nbsp;pole hinges to angle the control panel. However, using a vent brick as the controls is odd and it&nbsp;easily pops loose. The arrow bricks on the wings add decoration.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Blacktron-II&nbsp;minifigure with airtanks.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I had some fun with this, but soon it became a parts donor for other space projects and all the parts were standard space items that could be used on any design.&nbsp;</p>
