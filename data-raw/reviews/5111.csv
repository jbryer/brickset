Functionally the telescopic arm is a shade to heavy for the gear arrangement to lift it, so turning the control knob can be a little stiff.  A linkage system works the telescopic mechanism, but again this is a little awkward to.  I feel that the mechanism for emptying the bucket was an after thought by lego and was just put where it was for the sake of it.  Though moving it to be closer to the other controls at the back of the telescopic loader would be very difficult.  The steering works well.
This may sound negative but it is a great looking model and for &#163;20.00 it was good fun to build.  I would recommend this model to buy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

After a long wait, it has finally been released in the US and I was sure to snap up a few from Shop-At-Home right away.  The Telehandler functions very close to the real thing, even with the positioning of the cab and the rear-wheel steering.  The boom raises and also telescopes out quite far, and the alternative model(Front-End Loader) is nearly as fun to assemble and operate.  Quite a nice value for $30 US.  The only downfall to this is I wish Lego had included an alternative telescoping attachment to the bucket, like a Forklift style, this would make it truly like a Telehandler.  That aside, I highly recommend this model. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
