This was the 1st set (according to peeron) to have the Wedge piece 4 x 4 x 2/3 Curved in blue. When I found this part in blue, I wanted to make cars using this piece. This, along with the motor was the main reason I bought this set. The parts from this set are great (cheese slopes, exhaust tubes/pipes, larger tires, blue slopes, and nicely designed stickers).
I built this set and it had some trouble riding on its side so that cost this set a point in this review. I would still buy this set if I could, especially at the great price I found it for because the pieces are worth it. I bought this set for the parts, not because it was supposed to ride on its side. 
If you want to see the pick up truck I made using parts from this set, please visit my Brickshelf gallery at http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=246090",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
