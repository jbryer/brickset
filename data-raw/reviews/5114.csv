	I got this set at Walmart for about 10 dollars while with my grandparents as a small child, and I remember really liking it. It is more than just an average Racers set.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The pull-forward motor is interesting, and works well.</li>
	<li>
		The turnable wheels are a welcome addition to this great set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The stickers are a real pain in the you-know-what.</li>
	<li>
		I don&#39;t understand why this set is called the fire spinner if it has a cobra.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set is a really nice, inexpensive fist, and looks just as great or better than any Hot Wheels car ever, even if there isn&#39;t licensing. I would buy it at around a 20 dollar pricepoint.</p>
