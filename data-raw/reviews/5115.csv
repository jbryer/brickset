The rear wheels are connected to a pullback motor which is a very fun thing to do. The car can also jump if you make an elevated ramp. I suggest you dont use stickers because this set has many useful pieces and I doubt you'll want to have a Frankenstein head pictured on your next civilian car MOC. It even has two basic wizard wands which are used as fenders. Also has many grille pieces. In fact this vehicle is jam packed with so many useful pieces I think you might want to buy another one lol. Even though he vehicle is large it is not for minifig use as nowadays it is a trend of Racers to make the vehicles uber small, which is okay as long as it is affordable and contain useful pieces such as this one.
