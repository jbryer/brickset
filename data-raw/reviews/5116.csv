"Monty","2006-02-17T04:00:55Z","Instruction Error","I don’t normally come back a third time, but I felt I must mention the fact that there is a mistake in the instructions which tell you to place the stickers for the grilles around the opening in the engine compartment back to front. At step 34 (8) these are shown facing back to front, and should be turned round. I have also obtained an improved appearance by carefully colouring in the “whites” of the eyes with a permanent black marker.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Otherwise, the set set is okay. On the box, they kind of doctor up the image up a little bit. The picture has a nice, slick curve that the set doesn't really have. The red color is nice, and it's a pretty good sized set. The interior is a disappointment. It's simple, and the engine is nothing special. Overall, the set is let down. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you're a huge Ferrari fan. Again, the stickers are horrible!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

First of all, I agree with the others, there are way too many stickers which overlap multiple bricks. Second, that arch pieces with the headlight stickers on the top need some support. The gap between them and the top of the bumpers means they can be pried apart easily, or depressed. Third, the car can't steer. This means when you push it around and you want to turn, you'll have to give those tires a good burning rubber. Fourth, the steering wheel extends down from the dashboard which isn't attached to the dashboard itself. Fifth, the wheels keep sliding off after a while. And finally, there are no doors, but thick walls made of 2x10 bricks that are probably bullet proof :) Piecewise, this set deserves 5/5. Lots of bricks, plates, and special pieces you can use for other things. So get this set, but only for the pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
