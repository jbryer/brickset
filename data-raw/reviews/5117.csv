"Yob","2006-12-28T18:24:31Z","Not bad, but where is the road base?","For a fairly expensive set, $80 aus, i was fairly disapointed to not get a road piece for the pits/podium to mount onto.  I can take the &quot;track&quot; section not having a road as its really wide, but the pit area should have something for it to sit on.

Other than that, lots of cool mini figs, more tools, i now have 4 f1 cars and can have a race, cept they are all the same car.....hehe.

my only gripe is where is the road?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-06-27T04:03:03.687Z","it's for a city race.","i bought this set with the sole intention of forming a city/town f1 race, much like the monaco grand prix, and it really works! the set is not much on its own, or in a stadium setting if that is how you think an f1 race should look like. but if you have an entire market street, other city buildings and road plates, this will become an awesome addition to your collection because once in a while you might want to depict a grand f1 event in your city using the existing road plates as your race tracks, with the city dwellers cheering on from the pavement and from building balconies. i am glad lego produced this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ejcmoorhouse","2009-09-10T11:22:05.967Z","Ferrari 1,2","this is a wonderful set the start line has little lights that start the race with the red and white kerbs. there is quite a lot of fire extensquers about. i like the the little control room with lap progress screens ect. i also like the garge because you can park the race cars there after a race.
        The race offical is the prime minister of my town, the two cars are racing round my town (but not for long after Law 4 comes in), the little blue guy (i call him sid) provides the news for weekend tv (sometimes the show adopts the name of a holiday). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MasterBuilder","2009-01-08T17:08:04.107Z","Quick dude change the tires!","Wow. This set was really cool because of the extreme lot of accesories it came with. There are tools, extra tires, cameras, spectator stands, a cart thing for the pit crew, a microphone, camera, gas pump, fire extinguisher, and plenty more. It even came with an awarding stand and trophy. With two cars, a finish line, and pit stop, this set gets a 9/10. The bad parts were trivial things like the jack being a push carrier and neither the announcer or the cameraman having a seperate place to film or commentate from, like a stand at the top or something. Overall, really great set, and decently priced.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"av8r1973","2011-01-11T12:18:11.997Z","Excellent diorama for F1 and Ferrari buffs","<p>We have been debating finding one of the old race sets from '88 to add a race section to our booming cityscape.&nbsp; We came across this set on Brickset and found a source here in Taiwan.&nbsp; More than retail, but it was NISB and was exactly what we were looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build was fun.&nbsp; Both my 3yo and 5yo daughters built one F1 car each, and I built the garage/stands.&nbsp; There are some outstanding parts, great parts, and not so good parts of the build and set, but I am glad I got it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As other reviewers mention, there are a lot of stickers.&nbsp; Granted, F1 is all about advertising revenue.&nbsp; The real races are stuffed with it everywhere it can be squeezed.&nbsp; For LEGO to make custom parts with screen printing isn't really expected, but for the price, I would expect at least the minifigs would be screen printed.&nbsp; Stickers that span more than one brick drive me nuts!&nbsp; I relocate quite often in my line of work and must disassemble my collection.&nbsp; That's gonna be messy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try to give thorough reviews and enjoy the finished product, so here goes.&nbsp; Sorry for the length, but there's a lot to discuss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outstanding parts:</p>
<p>1. 10 minifigs!</p>
<p>2. Flesh-colored heads for the drivers with some resemblance to the real drivers</p>
<p>3. Balaclava-clad heads for the pit crew</p>
<p>4. Giant silver trophy for the winner</p>
<p>5. Winner's circle and podium</p>
<p>6. Great looking tool cart</p>
<p>7. Clever garage and structure</p>
<p>8. Unique parts (garage superstructure, cup, tires/wheels, and tool holder</p>
<p>9. Schumacher's helmet was painted to match the real one</p>
<p>10. The tech booth was well thought-out with great looking computers</p>
<p>11. Cars and scene are actually minifig scale (also listed as a con)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great parts:</p>
<p>1. Wide tires on the cars</p>
<p>2. Pretty close resemblance to the real cars of 2006</p>
<p>3. Gas cart</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not so good parts:</p>
<p>1. Stickers, stickers, stickers.</p>
<p>2. More stickers (especially the ones that cover more than 1 brick!)</p>
<p>3. No stairs to the winner's circle</p>
<p>4. Back supports of garage are pretty flimsy - needs a could of 2x12 flat plates to hold the legs sturdy</p>
<p>5. No road plates for garage or finish line (I would willingly have paid a bit extra to get even a standard plate, though a custom plate would have been great.</p>
<p>6. Minifig torsos use stickers instead of screen printing</p>
<p>7. Cars are actually minifig scale - while it sounds good, this means that the cars are 6 lugs wide with an extra 1/2 lug on each side for tire clearance.&nbsp; That's wider than my bus, City truck, mobile police unit, etc...&nbsp; It also means the sold-separately F1 transporter truck (8654) is going to be even wider.&nbsp; I haven't built that yet, but I believe it's 10 lugs wide.&nbsp; This kit will be incorporated into my Cityscape, but&nbsp;I need to leave some space between my City vehicles and this set so it's not so obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I know the scale thing is not really a problem because this was marketed as ""Racers"" and not ""City"".&nbsp; But, what City is complete without a street course? (Though Italian courses aren't street courses, anyway).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can still find this kit and you are a race fan, it's worth getting.&nbsp; It makes a great shelf and conversation piece.&nbsp; The color combos are true representations of this spectacular power sports event and famed race team.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Roberto","2015-11-19T15:38:08.203Z","Ferrari en plein","<p>When you look at the middle 80&#39;s, when Town theme was at the dawn of a completely new era and was quickly coming closer to its peak, Lego released two sets: 6381 Motor Speedway and 6395 Victory Lap Raceway. Both them can be easily recognizable as the first big sets dedicated to racing motorsport, and it&#39;s not so difficult to understand why they are so beloved yet, thirty years later. Just look at them and you&#39;ll see how well Lego succeeded in order to obtain the purpose of representing the whole idea of racing world through some little but targeted and iconic elements. Of course they are rudimentary if compared to nowadays standard, but in any case they are essential in their simplicity, and it&#39;s hard to find some different elements, but equally iconic, not being already expressed in these two illustrious predecessors. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So, someone could say, how many hopes could have a new set inspired to the same subject, not to be too similar to these two sets? And here&#39;s the cool thing, because 8672 Ferrari Finish Line achieves the difficult goal not to be a simple repetition of an old concept, but instead bringing new elements in a completely fresh style.</p>

<h3>The podium and the box</h3>

<p>The podium section is by far the most beautiful we have ever seen before, it is very spacious and appropriate for a F1 context, so they are the glass curved panels which add a little of elegance, the nationality flags for the drivers reaching the podium (which unfortunately are given to us only in three nations), and finally the chequered background which bears the imprint of &quot;Italian Grand Prix&quot; and which definitely deletes any doubt about us racing or not at Monza. The Box is more conventional, much smaller than the one seen in 8144 Ferrari 248 F1 Team and not particularly intriguing, the cars are cramped inside it and there is no room for doing anything else except just park them. In any case it carries out its task in doing this.</p>

<h3>The starting lights and the pit wall</h3>

<p>While a precious starting lights enriches the whole scene giving us a little fragment of the track, something that I find very captivating too in this set is certainly the pit wall corner. In all his simplicity it&#39;s extremely detailed and realistic: with a little raised basement, a little roof, and 4 different screen stickers (2 for TV coverage and 2 for telemetry), it is a nice little touch and a very original addition to the set.</p>

<h3>The cars&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The model used for the cars is the same introduced by Lego with 8375 Ferrari Pit Set, with only minor differences regarding the livery stickers. For a minifig scale F1 it is very realistic and similar to its real counterpart, and surely Lego did a great job using some SNOT solutions. I appreciate very much some selection of pieces, and how the curved lines of the front nose (curved slope 6x2) are accompanied by the ones of the side-pods (4 curved slope 2 x 2 with no studs) and even by the ones of the air intake over the driver&#39;s head (technic pin connector plate). They complement one another and give the whole model a more rounded, pleasant looking.</p>

<p>To complete the set comes a vast assortment of minifigs and dedicated stuff: drivers, pit crew, TV staff with cameraman and commentator, and finally a race director.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I had a great time building this set and I recommend it to everyone, it&#39;s nice to see how many new ideas were brought with this set and how well they were carried out. Fun to build but even more fun to play, the perfect choice for any kid looking for a great race full of action and a podium celebration scene. Highly recommended to everyone.</p>
