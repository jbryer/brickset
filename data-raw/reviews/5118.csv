"Errex","2007-03-20T16:19:46.467Z","A near perfect little set.","This set consists of five minifigures, a F1 race car and a few extra accesories, like a cart with tanks, a few extinguishers and a fuel pump.

The set comes with several interesting elements, especially three different types of hoses, and includes a chromed helmet for the refueling crew member.

Construction is pretty straight forward, and can be completed in under an hour following the well detailed instructions printed on the booklet. 

The only glaring fault with the instruction book comes from not showing where does one of the fuel pump decals go, although it is not very hard to figure out where it should be placed.

And speaking of decals, this set has them in spades. A fair amount of them go onto the car, as expected, and the decal sheet even has an alternate front decal sporting the number 2.

A few more decals go onto the fuel pump accessory, but TEN of them go directly to the backs and torsos of the mini figures.

Yes, none of the minifigures has printed on them the patches and logos shown in the pictures. It was something I did not expect, and that I found to be somewhat annoying, more so considering that all of the figures sport identical decoration.

Nonetheless, this is avery nice set to build. It has a rather good amount of detail and some really neat uses of SNOT on the sides of the car.

If you are into F1 cars, or just want to  build up your mini figure collection, this is the set for you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"adik_sa_lego","2007-11-19T19:46:17.093Z","a great starter set","this is the perfect starter set for lego ferrari collectors, along with the pit stop set. it also goes along really well with the ferrari truck set.

my only hook-up in this set is that it's hard to setup the fuel guy while he is holding the gas line, unless the gas tank is really far and is perpendicular to the car itself.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-26T10:41:36.903Z","LEGO Racers (Ferrari) - Ferrari F1 Fuel Stop Review","As a huge formula 1 fan I can't really complain about this set. We get a lot of stuff in this set: We get a trolley with an extra tyre, a computer, a trolley with fuel, a trolley with gas and a formula 1 car which is really detailed. It's a great car to add in your LEGO collection and I also like the details of the sponsors on the car. The driver fits in very nicely and you can play with this car very easily. The whole build is very easy and it's lot's of fun. The whole car and all trolleys are very sturdy as well. The only things which I don't like is that this set has stickers. And you also have to put on stickers on the torso of a minifig!! The minifigs faces are still very good. Even the number of these figures we get in this set. We get 3 mechanics and an engineer with a red cap who could be the today's Mercedes GP boss Ross Brawn. I can't complai about this set and I really hope that LEGO is going to do a formula one theme with all teams, drivers and race tracks since 1950 eventually.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
