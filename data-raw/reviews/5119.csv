It really is useless. So do a favor and don't consider this set to anyone. They'll hate you if you do that! Th only thing that I consider &quot;good&quot; about this set is that if you are totally bored or if your kids are, and you are driving for a couple hours than this will keep you (o your kids) kind of amused for the trip. But this is definetly not my type of set.
