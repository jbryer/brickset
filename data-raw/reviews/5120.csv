"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-12T02:12:24.89Z","Grand Soccer Stadium","I had intended to buy a stadium for a while. I figured that really no city is comeplete without a stadium of some sort. Really, I think that stadiums, (non-lego ones), are a waste of time and money. If you want to be part of a soccer or rugby game then go and play one yourself. I am not a sports fanatic, and I think that humans are strange watching sports instead of playing them. I think the same for horse racing. A waste of money, but it is a way of obtaining the money for lego sets while feeding yourself for another day! Risky though. Lego stadiums, however, are games you play yourself with a friend. 

I know that this would go really well with the city I had under construction then, which was when I was not yet interested in star wars. Otherwise I would have purchased something else, but still I am more or less happy with my purchase. Anyway, I assumed a stadium would take up a bit of room in my city and it would make it seem more city-like. Anyway, I went to a local shop with a bit of money and looked for a stadium. This was perfect. I could see the exo-skeleton of the stadium and it looked cool, I also remembered that there was a very big staduim under construction up in Auckland, Eden Park. The complete model looked a bit like that, except that there is no opening roof on this one.

The box art helped me buy this set, it was pretty good. They had the stadium piece shown on the outside and then there was a picture of a long haired minifig on it kicking a ball. I like long haired minifigs, they look cool to me. It was perfect for what I was looking for. It was a big box, and as lego do, they put the pieces in an unecessarily large box. But it was fine this time because they had to hold that massive stadium in there. There are way too less pieces though. The construction is stupid because its almost like you don’t build anything. All you do is connect little green boards to each other and shove it in the stadium, which does not support it with studs or anything. Just a hinge that lego thought might be nice instead of something that actually stuck it there. I don’t like this because if you tip it upside down then the pitch will fall out, but then again why would there be any reason to tip it? 

I was happy with my purchase from the moment I made it and couldn’t wait to build it. The stadium base poking out of the box tempted me to just rip into it and get it made so that I can use it. I found the construction rather easy, in all honesty I found that there were not much pieces at all. But, the quantity of the set should be measured in volume instead. The lego company collect granules for them to heat up at a massive temperature in a mould for a couple of seconds before immediately cooling it down again. And then, we have plastic! The stadium exo-skeleton is a large piece compared to some, and has a bit of volume it it too. Sadenning, I was looking forward to building the actual stadium thing. 

Anyway, construction was sad and disappointing, mostly because of the stickers you need to apply. You need to make them straight as well, otherwise it looks strange on the pitch. Yep, all the white bits on the pitch are stickers for you! I don’t know why printed bricks are so impossible. It gets worse as well. Lego don’t want to colour in the minifigures so they just print out a sticker sheet with the logos and things for the minifigures. I only applied the stickers to the pitch and did not waste time on the adverts or the shirts on the minifigs.

The box art helped me buy this set, it was pretty good. They had the stadium piece shown on the outside and then there was a picture of a long haired minifig on it kicking a ball. I like long haired minifigs, they look cool to me. Also it had a lot of minifig faces which I have not come across before. They look like professional players from the look on the box, but the funny thing is that they only have two people cherring for them. 

There are two sides to the set. They are both the same except in a different colour. There is the red side and then there is the blue side. I prefer the blue, as a star wars fan I have learnt that red is usually the dark side. The two sides can hold a few people on each. There are six by two benches in the two sides, eighteen in total. If you are a lego collector that uses minifigures often you would know that it isn’t very good if you are working with a bench that small because you can only fit two people on it. Anyway, there are scoreboards behind a middle bench either side and usually if someone is sitting on the bench they get a good little knock over the head if the score changes.

The scoreboards are really simple, and simple to build. On one scoreboard there is mounted five flapping square wing plates, connected to a handle piece so that it can move around. Lower in the scoreboard, there is a few plates that prevent the wing plates from being ungrippable, if you will. The wing plates have numbers one to five on them, and you lift up the correct one to reveal the current score. The problem is that the two scoreboards are placed opposite to each other, and sometimes if a wing flap is not already revealed it’s number I get confused between the one and the five! The two are opposite each other on the two scoreboards.

The real building part. The lights. Although some of it is not building because the pillars are already made. Anyway, it has three things that look like telephones, and they are connected to lime green transparent-ish round dome dishes. There are three of the telephone things connected to a six by two plate mounted at a downwards angle to the pitch, and if they worked I would like to see a minifigure with four shadows. Anyway, the six by four plate is stuck to the pillar which is connected by technic pin to the stadium. Everything is connected by technic pin, except for the pitch.

The pitch is as I said, a bunch of little green boards shoved in the stadium. Perhaps I might explain it in further detail. You see, there are twelve large 16 by eight with a hieght of a brick, rectangular pieces. These have little places for minifigure stands to stand in. These bricks lego lets you arrange in any order but I just did it lego’s way. There are two special ones of these, which allow the players to move side to side, but only one per team. The minifigure stands are basically technic pins with a spring mounted two stud wide minifig holders on them. You place these in the technic slots in the large green pieces and you can flick them. Often in construction the green pieces fall apart from each other because they are only hold by small plates. 

The minifigs ironically sit in the minifig holder, and then you ironically place your thumb on the part where you place your thumb, at the back. You then let go, and if the player is in possession of one of the balls, (there is three) then the spring launches it forward and successfully flicks the ball away. This game is good because you don’t need to be fast, but you just need to know how to curve the balls across the pitch. 

The goalie I got really annoyed with. I know how to work it, but because my sister didn’t she broke it. The goalie is different because he has much more playability. He is mounted on a stick, and the stick is connected to a simple pivot design. The pivot mechanism has a rubber band on it and if you pull back then the goalie launches forwards, ‘kicking’ the ball to a far place across the pitch. Never push the goalie towards the pitch. You are meant to pull and let go, not push. My sister did that and she still does it because she cannot work it out. It somehow makes the mechanism unusable and when I try replacing the parts she wrecks it again. Please do not do this. 

The goals for the goalie are custom for lego but sometimes the ball goes in the net and no one is sure that it did. Anyway, the goals do look good and there is a nice place for the balls to roll into once it went in the net. The balls roll because that part of the stadium is slanted and so the balls go in willingly there once a goal is scored. The balls are the same size and have a normal ball pattern except for one. That one has a special pattern on it that looks cooler than the others.

Overall this is a good set for playability. If you are buying this for the joy of building it you are just kidding yourself. But what it lacks in building levels up with the playability of it. I like foosball and this isn’t much like it, foosball is much faster. Seriously, you could lounge around drinking a cup of tea or something because the real art in this game is getting the ball to play with physics. Anyway, this is a great set and I think that you know enough about it now to decide whether or not it is worth buying, and you know what you want or expect out of this set. Just remember this; Tell your opponent how to work everything before you start and also remember that this is a competitive game. You can have arguments on whether or not the ball went in but chances are you know how to play and will follow the rules. Good luck, this set is a good buy but it depends on how much you use it.

My only complaint being the stickers, I mean seriously why make stickers for the minifigures, just print them on them Lego. So I didn't put the stickers on. It only took me like a half hour or so to build, but it was very fun, to build, and play. The lights kind of get in the way so I take them down when I play. Overall great set with good pieces and figs. I would rate it 4.5, but can't. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
