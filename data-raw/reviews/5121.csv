The catapult is very sturdy, and the boulder can shoot up to 10 feet! As you push the catapult, the two axes move back and for a slicing affect. Now for the best part... KING JAYKO! They really made a cool change to him making him look better than ever! His armor includes very large, but not too large leg protectors and shoulder pads, both chrome. His torso has a picture of a white hawk. and both of his arms move for a &quot;fighting&quot; affect! His face changed, making him look older, and having a beard, and the crown is very cool, and gold colored. King Jayko's shield has the image of, once again, a GOLD hawk, and is also pretty hard to break off in &quot;battle!&quot;. and now the coolest part... his sword! his sword is a swift white, and very cool design on it. All in all, an AWESOME set! buy it! you wont regret it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The crown are the same, can be used in all knights. This king with the hawk symbol don't like a king of the real life, but the new catapult is a adittion for creation, and the axes can be used with various themes, including bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The silver armor and sword don't work for me.<br></li><li>-The fact that Jayko has aged so much is a bit strange...<br></li><li>…</li></ul><p>This set is really great, and is a great addition to the Knight's Kingdom collection.
