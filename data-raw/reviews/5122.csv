Things like his sword (the greater of the Knights), his spiked armors, his cover and of course, his cannon, are never seen before in the Knights kingdom series, doing that he looks like more new and cool. Unfortunately, his body, face, helmet and shield are not that i was searching for a knight, because these are from the 2005 vladek with color difference. His Cannon is suplementar to a real Knight battle and also for Knights battle on sets. A good option for fun. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
