Other thing thatmakes it is the helmet. His weapon is one great inovation of the year of 2006, later splited and used as armor in toa mahri hewkii. The moves make more playabilty in the set. In overall, Sir Kentis is a good set to play, and i rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

We also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet and the head of this figure can be moved and the visor can be moved as well. Kentis has a mace in one hand and in his other hand you can see a nice shield with some nice markings on it. On the back of the torso you can see two levers which makes he arms moving. It's a cool figure to have for sure - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
