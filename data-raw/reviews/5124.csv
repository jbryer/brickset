"Blade","2007-12-25T20:46:07.89Z","LEGO Action Figure 1","I mainly bought this model because of its cool looking canister and it was on sale for $6.50. Its not a bad model really, more like a LEGO action figure or human version of a Slizer or Bionicle.

Sir Adric is quite simple to construct with lots of moving joints in the arms, legs and neck. His armour helps bulk him out a little, which makes him look so much tougher and this helmet flips open and closed. His weapons are what really caught me about this model. A nice big shield that is solid and could stop an attack. Also his axe, what an awesome axe. The shape and design is just sweet, making him look truly dangerous.

The other cool thing about this model is his arms move up and down. There are two switches at the back, one for each arm. So when playing with this model he can chop and block. I still prefer to manually move his arms, but it is a nice feature.

Overall these aren't to bad. You see them and you think what a piece of garbage but it really isn't the case. If you like action figures these are definitely for you. You can bust them up and break them but when your finished they go back to perfect condition. I would have to rate this one a 6/10, because it has some serious pros and time and effort went into it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-13T14:59:02.06Z","Sir Adric","This set is pretty cool, basically a building action figure, like all of the knights kingdom series of 2004 to 2006. This set was released in 2006, the last year of the series. The sir adric's color scheme is good, an metalic painted silver and red. The playability is the same of the other knights, just gears in a body that is a complete piece. The weapon, like some of the 2006 knights is different from the old, and the weapon included in this set is a axe. The design is nice, and also in the helmet, that do this figure looks like a knight. The face of the knight is yellow with an different design of the old. The armors are more solid pieces than the armors of the kights from 2004 or 2005, that is also not much useful in some lego themes, but still cool. The shield is great designed, with the symbol of a bull, and also have good color. Overall, Sir Adric not have much differences from the other Knights kingdom building action figures, but still in a good style. I rate 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2009-08-05T15:37:23.797Z","So much armour!","Sir Adric from the latest Knight's Kingdom range is certainly better than the old, unrealistic knights. He has lots more armour, a MASSIVE sheild, and 2 levers at the back to move his arms. And a giant axe, one of my favorite weapons.

Pros:
Armoured
Giant Axe
Much-improved sheild, now thicker and made of plastic

Cons:
Sheild falls off easily
Hard to stand up

Overall, 4/5, a great knight.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Agent_Flex_the_Lego_lover","2008-07-04T17:45:53.827Z","Good, bad,?","Adric is a pretty cool knight though... HE CAN'T STAND UP TO SAVE HIS LIFE!I also don't like the fact that his shield won't stay on. You move him a little and ,pop, go's his shield. He is a cool knight though. I like the bull and his cool ax. Truth be told I like the old knights better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-13T10:13:28.76Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Sir Adric Review","This is a very cool figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. This knight figure is very easy to build and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved and the visor can move as well. One hand of this knight has a battle ax and the other arm has a shield with some cool markings on it. On the back is a lever which makes it possible to move the shield up and down. As I told you in the beginning:  It's a cool figure to have for sure - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"tkettle9719","2011-12-28T19:04:26.13Z","Adric of the Meat!","<p>This is my favorite normal knight from Knights Kingdom II, and with good reason. Whether it be the new armor, or the great bull insignia, this knight is awesome. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The bull insignia is great and mighty.<br></li><li>-The new armor pieces are bulkier and cooler.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The Gold on the shield is right, but it is just a bit weird. <br></li><li>-The armor on the shoulders is just a bit strange. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>The fact that this model has an axe is a very cool and unique feature. This is not a normal knight by many means, and stands out above the rest. Excellent job, Lego.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
