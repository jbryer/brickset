"savepuffy","2007-12-31T16:05:03.827Z","pretty good","I got this set for my birthday and was happy with it.


Sword- I like the sword alot because it looks easily controlable and fun to hit my other knights kingdom stuff with.

Sword Rating(7/10)


Shield- Personely my shield falls off or breaks off alot but I think the Dragon design is kinda cool

Shield Rating(5/10)


Helmet- I like the spikes and the shiny color of the helmet and how it has cheek guards.  It's fun to put in the place of the Vlad Mask in Vladek's dark fortress to show that an army of kller nuclear skeletons with new 2007 star wars guns have taken over.

Helmet Rating(8/10)


Armor- Just like the helmet the armor is shiny and fun to put n the good guys

Armor Rating(6/10)


Core Body- If you line up the sword just right and us the gear at the back you can get a good jab at the good guy but a gear to move the shield would have been nice.  Body is still shiny so I still like it.

Core Body Rating(7/10)


Overall Rating(6/10)

This set is really fun when you have Karzon,Vladek,Adric and Kentis though.  So if your buying this set get two or three more to figh with.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The colors too, being yellow and black. The silver sword is great, and the shield symbol, dragon, makes he likes a knight of epic fictions. In overall, it is great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Also, I hadn't had the chance to own any of the 'action figure' knights so it would be a good chance to check it out and review it.

Overall: I like how they had studs at certain places on the body, such as the chest and also on the shield. I placed Lego trees and shrubs on the chest and it fits well with any System brick.

Head: Interesting piece of head that is basically Technic. Very amusing if you put the head on top of a Technic spider.

Body: Body is all in a single piece and contains a button which doesn't seem to do anything for me :( 

Armor: The brushed chrome shoulderplates and also the shield is awesome!

Weapon: Similar to Bionicle weapons but more suited for knightdom.

I think that this set is overall okay but it doesn't appeal much to me.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-12T10:21:17.363Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Dracus Review","This is cool figure and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The legs, the feet, the arms and the head of this figure can be moved. You can also move the visor up and down. One arm has a shield with some great markings and a dragon. On the back of the figure you can find a lever which will move the other arm which has a sword. It's a cool figure to have for sure - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
