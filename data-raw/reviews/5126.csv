"Gus_263","2008-03-13T15:26:14.983Z","Karzon the rogue knight","Karzon is one of the building action figure sets from the knights kingdom series released in 2006. This set not have much differences from the others of the 2006 year, and still good in design and playability. The color scheme is great and also the design. The armors are the same of the other rogue knights from 2006, a solid piece that is not a much good piece to make creations with other lego themes. The body is another unic piece, that have gear systems to move the arms, with the same playability systems of the other knights. The legs are in a good size and are basically the same of other rogue knights, with difference only in the color scheme. The flail is a great weapon for a knight, also good builted and designed, but don't works very good. The shield have a little circular format with nice details and a snake symbol. The knight's face is yellow to remember lego minifigures and the face looks like from a old rogue knight. The helmet is also awesome designed. Overall Karzon have some useful pieces and also some unuseful pieces, from the knights kingdom particular characteristics, and due to the playability, design and color scheme, i rate Karzon 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Cool desighn. like the snake on shield and its cool how he has only one eye. Brown and light blue make him look cool.

Shield falls of to easily. One bump and its of. Pretty poinles.

I don't like the fact that he kills him self when he uses his spiky ball. He wont when a battle when he killing himself!

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-12T10:15:56.16Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom II) - Karzon Review","<p>This is a good figure to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The arms, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved and if you move the lever on the back of the torso you can move the arm which has a mace up and down. The other arm has a shield with some cool markings on it and a very cool snake symbol. The visor can move up and down as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good figure to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.</p><p><br></p><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
