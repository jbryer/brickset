"CC","2006-02-19T16:55:41Z","Great Set","This is the best of the four mechs in the Exo-Force line.(I own them all)  I personally do not mind its large quantity of stickers other than the fact that is takes me a while to apply all of them.  This set also comes with many curvey slope pieces which is nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"FellintoOblivion","2006-03-09T09:56:08Z","","Ill only list the things I didnt like about the set.

~Lighting Tube
     Could stand to be a little longer. It tends to limit the movement of the gun.

~Gun
     Its pretty puny. I would like to have seen it bulked up a bit.

~Cockpit
     The way it is attached is pretty flimsy.

~Leg Joints
     I would like to have seen them use mirrored pieces for the 3x2 middle joint piece so that the white hinges faced opposite directions on the legs instead of facing the same way like they do now. 

Thats pretty much it. Pretty minor complaint. Overall its a very nice model.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2007-02-03T16:00:08.067Z","Good mech, good pieces, good value!","This is another great Exo-force set. Besides having a good selection of pieces (lots of white slopes and joints!), the finished model is very sleek. The way they did the gun is really ingenious, and the slanted cockpit makes the model even cooler. I don't like the Hikaru minifig that much; his front face is weird with the orange highlights, and the back face is just... ugly. I also wish the Exo-force mechs came with a few acessories, but other than that, this kit is a winner. 4/5 - Great!

P.S. The alternate model seen on lego.com (Stealth Wasp) is cool, but very unstable!

"greg_duncan","2006-06-11T17:28:48Z","This. Is . Awesome!!","this is a great set, despite the stickers. they just make it look better. the alternate model is truly excellent, and the features of the main models are simply outstanding,especially that light me up feature. hikaru rocks, even though hr has the same face as &quot;ryo&quot; in 7705, but I reccomend this set anyway.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legoman1993","2006-12-31T18:10:44Z","COOL! ROBOT!","I got this set for Chirstmas.Although Im not a Exo-force fan I really liked this set!  {This set is got to be one of the best out of the 4 that I got for Chirstmas!} My favorite part to play with is the  sword part on this robot set that spins! I would give the gun part of the robot 4\5 because it could have had a little more pieces added to it! The stickers took a bit long to put on.I wonder why the lego company had to use stickers.{Maybe because it cost more money to put the design on the lego pieces?}its a good set to own!

"M_Tron_Hero_Kodiak","2007-02-15T01:05:53.013Z","Stealthy?  Try Standing out like a sore thumb~!","I was impressed and suprise when Lego introduced a &quot;mecha&quot; theme, but its more closely akin to Exo Squad back in the day.  Though these are larger, they pretty much have the same idea ( increases firepower, strength, speed, overall capacity of a infantry solider).
Which is the reason why I bought this model. 

 However, for stealthy-ness it doesnt stand up.  White is a pretty bad color for that application.  As for flying the wings could be better.  But in the thought of flimsyness and sort it is a stealth/scout &quot;mech.&quot;
The Stickers arent that bad, but stickers on legos tend to last only one year anyways...

Weapons wise, the laser cannon is nice, the double edge sword is more of a pain, and only one rocket and one backup laser/maser emitter is weak.  But again its mainly for stealth and scouting.

The cockpit is flimsy also, wouldnt hold up even in pretend combat let alone lego &quot;combat.&quot;",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-02T07:33:55.817Z","just for the alternative model","i really didn't want to buy that set, but it was on sale, and still its lego, so i got it.
the main model disappoints as expected, but the alternative model, called stealth wasp, really has something on it. it actually looks like an insect, the otherwise useless wedges make up a very nice &quot;body&quot;, wherein the pilot is comfortably seated.
so in the end the whole set is worth a second look, i guess.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-14T14:29:35.683Z","Could be better","Unlike my ufortinate ST sets this set is stiil in the box and not in my Lego grave.

Pros:

Nice weapon.
Cool sword.
Missle and radar dish on shoulders.

Cons:
wings are fragile.
Light up tube ristricts gun movement.
Falls over a lot.
Cotpit has a open roof and gaps in the side.

Buy if you're building an army or like Hikaru.
Don't buy if you'd rather have something more impressive or less fragile.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-11T16:07:54.2Z","Exo-force stealth hunter","This is a white machine with a pilot minifigure named hikaru. This have blue hair, to combine with the blue details, letters and numbers on the machine and it's wings. These are good, like the smaler wings on leg, great for aerial combat. Have fun and have playable pieces, some from the knights' kingdom action figures. It includes a glowing piece, a weapon and two swords from the same line, knights' kingdom. The cockpit is great, capable to put the pilot easily in it. The arms are short, and don't have hands. One part of the arm is from knights kingdom series and another is little. Have 164 pieces and can be used to make a combination, have useful parts, and cool minifigure. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-16T19:44:01.25Z","very bad","this set is preatty much useless. there are too many stickers and it takes a while to find out where they go. also white is the opposite of stealth so whats the deal with that? the animae style figure is stupid except for his rubber hair. the wings dont look like wings at all. the only good part is the light piece and how it goes up the clear tube. its obviously the worst exo force set i bought (i liked it at the time). i just pack it up in its box and put it in my closet. i would not recomment this set to anyone at all!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2009-02-04T18:02:20.857Z","Well...","This set is average. It looks cool and the way you can change the position of it is nice, but it is sort of weak and if it falls down from when it is standing, you have to readjust the arms and legs, and it just takes a lot of fidgeting. On to pros and cons:

Pros:
Cool minifig
interesting design
light brick
good pieces

Cons:
Fragile
Over priced



If you're into the Exo-Force series then get this set, but don't just get it to get it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-24T20:17:07.077Z","*WARNING* THIS SIDE UP -- FRAGILE","Okay, so what we have here is a bit of thin china... no, just kidding, but it's just as fragile if you mishandle it.
I just rediscovered this set today along with my 'old' City Digger and KK Border Ambush.  First thing I tried doing is pressing down on a mechanism on the back to turn on the light.  Nothing happened.  I opened the cockpit to expose the light brick and pressed the lever again.  A weak, red glow emanated from the clear brick.  I checked the inside of the laser gun scope to see if the 'fiber optic' cable was picking it up and shooting it out. A weak red light was seen on the tip. :( So, if you have this set, DO NOT leave it somewhere for a long time, because the battery eventually flips out, and you're left like me.
Back to the subject. A good set for the first EXO-Force of mine, but it is still very tipsy and fragile.  The fiber optic cable keeps knocking off that rocket on top, and the fins on the feet fall off nonstop.

Pros:

-Hikaru fig

-Light-up brick

-Playability

-Poseability

Cons:

-Light-up brick

-Fins on legs

-Fiber optic

-Cockpit falls off

All in all, 4/5.  Bye bye, EXO-Force, and good riddance I say! ;)

"greshmalum","2009-11-12T08:26:23.653Z","okay","This set would be great if the legs weren't falling off all the time. And getting that tube through the rifle was such a pain. 

Pros~
torso+legs
fins of battle machine
white swords great for bionicle MOCs
light up brick
elements

Cons~
Swooshability would be great if the legs didn't fall off so easily
hard to get tube in gun 
Hikaru's action face can be seen through the back of his hair
rubber hair
hair falls of easy
stickers~ I don't usually mind them, but Exo-Force has way too many

The set was not too bad if you are really careful when flying it. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The design is nice!

However it's a pain to put the light wire in place and it breaks quite easily, and oh yeah how the heck should this guy be able to operate this kind of mecha suit without any kind of controls?
The stickers are pretty overflowed too...

However if you enjoy Lego robots this is a must have and you will be able to have fun with it for a time despite it's fairly weak construction.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"GeorgeDexter","2010-07-21T00:09:41.06Z"," A great looking set for display","<p>This is&nbsp;a fun build, but has the usual Exo-Force issues:</p>
<p>falls apart easily, open back, cockpit windscreen poorly attached, windscreen doesn't cover fully.</p>
<p>I know these are fantasy toys, but&nbsp;as armored suits they could offer more protection.&nbsp; The drivers in these are so exposed they wouldn't last a minute in a real battle.&nbsp; They'd have to dodge every attack or&nbsp;use force-fields.&nbsp; One hit from a long-range weapon would shatter the cockpit and kill the driver instantly.&nbsp; Oh, that's diamond-hard super-polymer transparent steel, you say?&nbsp; Well, the windscreen fits so poorly, you could kill the driver without even going through it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the light-up tubing would not&nbsp;fit into the gunsight element.&nbsp; I tried for 10 minutes.&nbsp; You'd have to lube it with dishwashing detergent or something.&nbsp; Finally I gave up and left the black cone element off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do really like this model as a display piece, and it was a fun build.&nbsp; It has some really cool design ideas and a great look, though I wouldn't mind if it had hands like the Supernova kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might still get a few other Exo-Force kits, but only as displays, or bases for modification; they're just too flimsy to play with.&nbsp; Not a bad value for $15, however.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,4

	I got this set at regular price at Target, and built it at a dentist office, where everyone watching was amazed by my skills, though the actual set wasn&#39;t really hard to build (people are always impressed by me with Legos, meat, or french horn playing).</p>
