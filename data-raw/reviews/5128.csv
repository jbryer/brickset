"Errex","2007-03-05T14:37:48.92Z","My favorite Mech from EXO Force","At first, I wasn't too thrilled by the prospect of a bright red mecha with a scissor hand and a stubby barrel gun.

Once I assembled the model, my opinion changed radically. 

The basic structure is similar to that of the other large Exo Force mecha, with the basic body containing the light-up brick ejection/lighting assembly, and receptacles for the arm and leg joints.

Considering the amount or armor it carries, the finished model is surprisingly stable, and can adopt several action poses without much trouble. If anything, I'd wish for slightly longer fiber optics (1 inch extra or so would do).

The Grand Titan comes with quite a number of decals that require a certain amount of aligning to look it's best, so I recommend to put those on at the time of assembly.

The enclosed minifig is also very cool, with two face prints on the head and the token anmime-spiky hair.

All in all, a pretty good set to have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cignal","2007-06-16T12:12:36.67Z","Excellently designed masterpiece of LEGO engineers"," This is seriously the best looking normal size Battle Machine from the Exo-Force line of models! The Electric Pincer Claw is one of a kind weapon and very practical for fighting, but also looks magnificent on this Ferrari-red Mech. 
 These 2006 Exo-Force toys are much better than those new 2007 sets, at least in a way that 2006 sets contain the ingenious and very useful Light Brick. Armor looks very bulky and durable. The left arms laser cannon really could be more bulky and the joints of the arms are a bit weak but the Knight's Kingdom joints would be too big for the arms. 
 This is also very durable Mech in use, it doesn't fall to pieces right away like some LEGO sets do. The Grand Titan looks great when fighting it's main enemy, the Robots' Thunder Fury. I highly recommend getting this set inspite one of the new ones, if you can still find these nice older sets anywhere. Here in Finland they don't really have these anywhere. 
 So, this is a unique Battle Machine, but unfortunately the worse new Mech sets are pushing these 2006 Battle Mechs out from the shelves of the shops. Great buy for any LEGO enthusiast!

"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-14T14:41:53.17Z","One of my Exo favourites","To start this review I shall point out that this review is of my opinion and doesn't mean you have to go marching down to the nearest toy store and buy it.To buisness now.

Pros:
Pincer is a good design and can rotate to grad something in a diiferent way.
Shoulder missles are a nice touch.
Has a armoured look like it's saying &quot;come and get me,I'll crush you&quot;
Laser cannon spins.

Cons:
Arms are to thin.
Light tube restricts movement of the gun.
Cotpit has open sides.

Buy if you want an army builder or a great set.
Don't buy if you'd rather save you money for something bigger.

"justrock","2007-10-28T15:53:57.903Z","No muscle","I can't get past the wimpy arms on this one. The claw hand feels like it is too heavy for those little joints. Don't get me wrong, overall it is a good looking set. The light tube does get in the way a bit, though. Think some small modifications could make this one even more a force to be reckoned with.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

of course i found some problem on the shoulder which previous review didn't mention.


But at first, we go to pros and cons

PROS:
The pincer!!
Laser rifle [lots of lime tr node]
Cool amour!
Nice rocket on the shoulder.
The alternative really cool!
[Titan Tracker]

CONS:
Goes to the rocket-
The 4L stick in the rocket is very difficult to get out after you assemble them.
It stuck inside the rocket. But, there is a solving way.
Other? NO~

Still, it is a good set for Exo-Force Fans~",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

2 rockets
Light up bricks for 'Power Up'
Huge feet

Cons:

"legoguysw","2008-06-15T10:33:20.827Z","Not so Grand Titan","This is one of the first ExoForce sets, and if you were in 2006, it would be the set you'd most likely think about when someone said 'Exo Force', because its big, red and iconic. It has a nice big laser gun (yay for trans-green cylinders!), a huge pair of scissors, and either 'chin' guns or 'moustache' guns (the laser gun bits under the cockpit), I have yet to decide which one suits best. What I did with this set was take away part of the legs so now its nice and short so it doesn't fall over so easily. That gave me spare pieces you could make the feet bigger with.
What i liked about the 06 Exo Force theme was how they stuck to blocks rather than Bioicle pieces. This was great, because if they had used  Technic/bionicle parts like they did in the 07 line, it would have been un stable and unable to stand up.
The laser cannon lights up because of the light brick behind the cockpit, and the light travels through a tube to the laser cannon.
Cool.
This set comes with the manga, green haired fig Takeshi. (anyone seen Takeshi's castle on Challenge ( a channel)? lol!)
Overall a 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-11T16:17:55.31Z","Not very a titan","This is another exo-force with knights' kingdom things, the armors of legs and arms and parts of they. Featuring the same glowing piece, have too details, symbols and red color. The blades aren't from knights series, but from bionicle, these, that makes a claw are the aero slicer. In another arm, he have a weapon, good made, and the feet looks like with the others, original lego pieces. The minifigure have another strange hair, a green, with funny face. The cockpit is different, smaller than the stealth hunter's. I think that the grand titan isn't very big, but the name says nothing of the toy, i rate 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-11-29T17:38:12.827Z","cool set!","This set was pretty neat. It has a great laser blaster and a terrificly working claw. The mini-fig with a switchable head (From calm to yelling) is really awesome and his hair is just like anime hair. The actual set was really fun to build and looks really high-tech. Unfortunatly, it falls apart really easily, which is the biggest problem in my opinion.

"krysto2002","2008-08-01T15:43:01.653Z","Awesome mech, but has flaws...","Like I said, this is an awesome, fully posable mech. The japanese anime feel is even cooler, but the set, in all its glory, still has flaws. For $15 this is a great buy at almost 200 parts (yay!), much more than the other &quot;human&quot; mech. The mech has a fairly small waist (which is not good considering the obvious bulk of the set) with a greatly detail cockpit. The doublesided heads are cool but the &quot;angry&quot; side is,... well... just plain ugly. The anime style green hair is a cool touch, and a relief from the previous &quot;hard hairs&quot; before it. The torso is a really cool armor suit, so it is a great item to have. The LED light is a cool touch, especially since it illuminates the nozzle of the laser when pressed by the lever in back (which doesn't always work well...), and adds a cool machine gun effect to the weapon, but it also limits the movement of the arm. The claw is big and fearsome, especially for cutting the vital &quot;power cables&quot; (fiber optic cables) that are on all of the mechs (but who would put the most vital weakspot on the outside anyways!?). The deteails are cool, but the set has too many stickers. There is also a cool antennae and monkey wrench for repairs, and the shoulders are cool but sometimes come off! Worst and best of all is the missiles, which for play purposes are wicked cool, but highly impractical. Has anyone else had the problem where the plastic bars don't fit into the cones and must be pushed with extreme force to get them in? Either way, firing the missiles is a problem, since it isn't easy (this is why missile launchers similar to the Mars Mission's clawtank are better for play purposes).

The arms are beyond tiny, and the new hinge system is sturdier since it doesn't sag, but the arms tend to come apart when any pressure in the opposite direction (vertical as opposed to horizontal) is applied, plus these new hinges don't fold like the old ones, they click instead, making an annoying noise, and lessening the playability!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-10-18T17:04:48.653Z","Truly Grand in its own right.","This set is my favourite year one Exo-Force set. The Titan is the best giant fighting robot I have ever seen. I love the colour scheme and the claw is brilliant. I love having the GT grab the Thunder Fury's sword and hurl the latter halfway to Saskatchewan! Takeshi is my favourite pilot, and I love how there's also a wrench included for repairs. (Or if you wanna whack someone. HEH HEH HEH) ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But luckily, one day I found them on a store with a big 50% discount sticker on it.<br><br>What I like about the set :<br>1. Really cool Mecha design<br>2. You can combine it with another set to make a bigger mecha<br>3. You can pose this Mecha in a lot of different style<br>4. You get a cool Japanese manga style hair<br><br>What I don't like about this set :<br>1. The hose is intended to deliver the light from light brick into the machine gun thingy, but it really ruin the design and limiting the arm movement.<br>2. I think the mecha will be look cooler if the arm is not a scissor. I mean, what is the purpose of it? You destroy your enemy by cutting them into tiny pieces? Sorry, but I think a normal hand holding a blade will be much better.<br><br>In the end, if you are a Mecha or Japanese manga lover, you are going to love the set.<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3

"AETerry","2011-05-24T15:01:45Z","Grand Titan Review","<p>At $15.99, this set was fairly easy to grab and pick up from the toy aisle when out looking at LEGO. While Exo-Force wasn't my favorite theme, the more I've looked at the sets that I do have and compare pics of other sets in the archives, the more I would have liked to have gotten a few more then what I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grand Titan is the largest set from the Exo-Force theme I picked up and even today at the time of writing this review, is still up for display and show. Just the idea of having lego designs of mechs for minifigures to move around in is very cool. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There does appear to have been some specialty pieces made and incorporated for this theme so the mechs can move around and move their limbs. There is excellent articulation in the legs, hip and ankles for this mech.The Titan's got a good contrasting coloring of red with the white highlights and black. One arm is a pincer claw and the other arm is a gatling/cannon weapon for long range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The human minifigure is decent with the anime look and style hair, making it just fun to play and incorporate into designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that'd be my biggest regret with this theme is not having picked up more of mechs.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
