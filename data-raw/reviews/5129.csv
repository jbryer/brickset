"Blade","2007-06-29T23:54:27.78Z","Mech","Well i rebuilt this one today and i have to say i quite enjoyed it. As everyone can see yeah lots of cool weapons. Agreed that the gun is flimsy but the laser makes up for it. If you aren't after a perfect display model i redesigned the gun, very easy to do. This is what robs should have always been in LEGO. i loved the Bionicals before these but they were technic and the spyris i think it was, robots were good but lacked that much needed mech look.

One key feature i think everyone has failed to mention is the way all the parts required are catalogued at the back of the instructions. made it mighty easy to rebuild from a pile of models. I'm unsure if most new models have this now as i have been out of the scene for 3 years but this was a pain with older larger models.

Over all 10/10

I would Seriously recommend this model to buy :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-14T14:58:16.653Z","TAKE THIS HUMANS,MMUUUHHHHAHAHAHAHA","Like my Grand Titan review,reading this doesn't mean you have to buy this set,although I recomend buying it before it's replaced completly with 2007 sets.This was the third robot battle machine I got after Fire Vultre and Sentry.A unusual feature of the Thunder Fury is it has a hole behind the robot as if it's an escape route [I doubt this as the robots aren't to bothered if a robot doesn't return,they just make more].The main weapon,the big Laser cannon could be better because if the robot holds it up it falls forward.The chainsaw is good but is more for show unless you're planning to spend 3 hours cutting through armour with it.The red devastator is cool but is hard to get in and out the cotpit.

Buy if you're building an army or like the the Robots.
Don't buy if you don't like whopping great big laser cannons and fearsome looking chainsaws.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2008-01-18T21:33:47.793Z","very cool","this is a realy cool set. i think the 2006 exo force were the best there is, and this one rocks. the body is short and thick, it looks very well armourd, but the robot needs more protection. the body has about 8 small guns, and some antenas on the top. the saw is pretty cool, and has mixed colours wich makes it look cool. the gun is big, but its quite floppy. the legs are ok, but look a bit to skinny for the mech. although this set is quite hard to pose, it still has lots of playability, and nice peices. it alos has a lot of stickers, but they make it look a load better. this is a cool set and defintly worth getting",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-12T14:38:40.793Z","Robot's machine","A battle machine of the robots, is too very playable, features a big weapon, glowing piece, and the poseable parts of the knights' kingdom, that overs in the same year of the exo-force beginning. The minifigure of robot is different and playable, their hands are claws, but they are the same, changing in color. The color scheme is incredible, black, red and some gray... The blade on the left hand is great, used too in the white vahki from bionicle in 2004. The feet are lego bricks used on some themes like creator, racers... This is also playable and useful, a building toy and too an action figure. But it can be more cool in the arms, it don't have hand, the arm is short. It still good, have too a combination with the other robot's machine. I rate 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"guildfordmatt","2010-09-12T12:42:56.12Z","They've gone to town on the weapons and looks but not the durability.","<p>This set is a&nbsp; dissapointment; you see the adverts on lego.com and the magazine and perhaps on the telly and then you buy it. of course it can't really stand up on it's own so I put mine in a box on&nbsp;a shelf. Big mistake. The next time&nbsp;I got it out half of the stickers were stuck onto the box, all but one of the harpoon spike things were still attached, the main &quot;seat&quot; where the robot pilot &quot;sits&quot; had fallen off and the gun was holding limply at 40 degress (roughly) by the sticker.</p>
<p>Then I tested out the light brick thing that's ment to light the gun up. It was terrible&nbsp;I don't really know what I was suspecting but this was 5 times worse.</p>
<p>&quot;If this set is so bad&quot; you say &quot;why didn't you give it a 1 or a 2 ?&quot; Well thats simply because I think a child wouldn't really mind. I think said child would worry more about who would win in a fight between this the grand titan and how much damage it could take before it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pretty cool to play with</li>
    <li>Looks &quot;the bad guy&quot; part</li>
    <li>Robot minifigure</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Badly design especilay for clumsy children</li>
    <li>Light brick stuff</li>
    <li>A&nbsp;ton of stickers</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this proved useful.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3
