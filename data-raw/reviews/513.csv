"MPH","2007-08-28T11:43:39.88Z","Just pieces... but good ones!","Deja vu! This set is almost a copy of 6235 Buried Treasure, albeit nowhere near in coolness. Buried Treasure at least had some kind of story in it (pirate digs up treasure), but this set is... well, just a collection of pieces in my opinion.

Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. Certainly not with this set. The pirate minifig - as usual - is cool and loaded with weapons. There is a flag and a barrel. Barrels are good, because they bring some variety next to the treasure chests. 
Two little yellow baseplates can help you expand your island(s) and there is also a fare amount of green decoration. All usefull I would say, but as a set: pretty boring.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-30T21:59:14.403Z","Stunningly Simple!","This is one of my favourite sets as a kid. I have had this one for as long as I can remember. It doesn't look like much but it was never designed to be. The set is a whole 15 pieces, including fig but how many do you expect there to be on a desert island. 

The island itself is made up of two yellow base plates giving the mini-fig heaps of room. A pile of grey rocks with a little bit of plant life. Also the skull and crossbones flag has been staked into the rocks. There is also a barrel, which is really neat, that contains the fig's cutlass.

The mini-fig is dressed in grey pants, a blue shirt with a red and white striped singlet underneath and a black three point cap. His face has an eye patch some stubble and a long black fringe. 

Overall it's a good little model. It doesn't have much playability but with these older , simpler sets they were designed to be cheap and keep children amused till they got home to add it to their current collection and then really play. Aesthetically it is great for display and a good one for any pirate collection. 6/10. (Above Average)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Stash","2008-03-20T01:35:09.09Z","Impulse from the past - a great idea then as it is now!","We are seeing a return to this type of set for enhancing theme collections with the new 1 to 1.5 (I count, for example, the robot in the new mars impulse set and the dog in the police impulse set as half a mini-fig) mini-fig impulse sets. Hopefully they continue to be as common with several sets of this type featured for each product line. Not only are they are they a great way to get a cheap mini-fig, but they come with a small amount of useful pieces and accessories that complement any collection for a very low price. 

This set features a pirate on a tiny island with a small cache of supplies and a rock formation.

Mini-fig:

I cannot remember at this point all the different pirate figures, but this one strikes my memory as one of the more common standard pirates. He is well designed and accessorized though so no complaint there. 

Island:

The island comes with two small baseplates, a small rock formation, and some foliage. The leaves are somewhat scarce pieces and usually only found in small numbers in any set. Having two included in this set is a nice bargain to put together a large forest. The grey rock pieces are also useful in large numbers. 

Accessories:

The set comes with a sabre, pistol, barrel, tri-corner hat, and a pirate flag. A good number of accessories for a tiny set and not much else could be asked for given there is only one mini-fig. 


Overall this set comes very complete and well designed. I cannot remember the price anymore, but I am sure it was 5 dollars or less, putting it within cost range of current impulse sets and providing a large number of bricks and a well designed set for the price. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T15:56:58.89Z","Small but cool set","This set is from the year of 1992, and was released as one of the pirates Lego theme, one of the best themes ever made. Like some of the other pirates, this set is small but with good building, design and pieces are useful. The pirate lookout includes one of the original pirates figures, that features a simple and nice design with the lego classic style. The figure also have a hat, pistol and a sword. The other useful pieces are in a little scenery, basically a little wall, a small plate and a treasure in a chest. There is also a pirates flag, a barrel and some plants. These little features are builted with useful pieces and makes a awesome effect on this small set. Unlike the new impulse, this small set have more useful pieces and a classic style design. Overall, a basic useful set. So, i rate the &quot;Pirate Lookout&quot; 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bricksan","2012-05-30T10:49:37.647Z","1696 Pirate Lookout","I carry on reviewing my collection of classic pirate sets with a set from 1992. Pirate Lookout&nbsp; is another small set that you could get with your pocket money back in the day. I got this set from eBay last September for £3.70 plus postage and packaging, which wasn’t bad.&nbsp; This was not a set I owned the first time but when I built the model I felt it was a copy of Buried Treasure from 1989.<br><br>My copy I had to replace two of the gray bricks and the leafs to get the set a newer look but that is due to me being a very picky person<br><h4>Introduction</h4><br>You could get this set in either a polybag (1464) or boxed (1696). Nothing was different except for the packaging. As I am not bothered about packaging I am happy to own just the box version. This was the smallest set of the year and would have cost you £1.99 in the UK to buy. The set comes with 17 pieces, take away 6 that makes up the minifigure plus weapons, you are left with 11 bricks to build with.<br><br>The instructions is a two-sided piece of paper. The front is the cover photo and minifigure assembly. On the back is 4 stages of the build. A very easy model to put together but then what would you expect for a couple of pounds?<br><h4>The Build</h4><br>First was the minifigure. This minifigure by ’92 was 4 years old having come out in 1989, this version came with a black tricorne hat instead of the usual brown one. You got both a pistol and a cutlass for your minifugre. The build as I said above takes 4 stages to assemble.&nbsp; First you are require to put the two 6×4 plates together. Next you put the first two bricks on and then the next two completes stage 3. You finish by adding the flag, leafs, barrel and minifigure. Not exactly rocket science and another model that does not require instructions after building it just once.<br><br>What I do like about this model is the 3 models on the back you can build. The first is a paradise for the minifigure to relax under the leafs with the gray bricks acting as rocks. The second one has the minifigure using the rocks and leafs to hide behind for him to shot with his pistol. The 3rd has the bricks stacked up with the flag on top and him carrying the barrel on his shoulder.<br><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><br>Overall it’s a very small set with only 17 pieces for your money. I still think Buried Treasure is better and you get more value for money but when building this one and the various extra models on the back of the box, the set really grew on me and I enjoyed putting the extra models together. What I also like is you could do a decent scene if you put all the small pirate sets with yellow plates together and once I have them I probably will do something.<br><br>There is nothing in the way of building skill required for this but it can add to a bigger scene. If your a Pirate fan I say get one to add to your collection, if your not I say get something else.<br><br>Review on my site:http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/1696-pirate-lookout/<br>Photos on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629951491222/with/7294699736/<br>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
"tjprescott","2011-11-22T02:16:03.933Z","This contributes nothing to today's LEGO fanatic","I received this set as a gift when I was a kid and it was still in production. &nbsp;This set sells for about $8 on Bricklink, or about 60cents/piece. &nbsp;No piece is rare and there is no compelling design. &nbsp;It's literally some grey bricks randomly arranged to resemble a rock, with some foliage and a pirate flag. &nbsp;This set is effectively pointless to add to a collection. &nbsp;If you need a building set to figure out how to make a rock... well... you really need an imagination! &nbsp;As a value pack back in the day, sure it was worth it (to me it was a free minifig and some parts!) but there's absolutely no reason to add this to your collection today.<div><br></div><div><h4>Disclaimer!</h4><div>This set is discontinued. &nbsp;The purpose of my review is to suggest to a LEGO&nbsp;fan whether this is a quality set to add to their collection. &nbsp;My overall&nbsp;rating is based ONLY on Playability and Building Experience. &nbsp;See the ""LEGO&nbsp;interests"" section of my profile for my review philosophy on discontinued&nbsp;sets.</div></div>",TRUE,1,1,3,1,1
"Mlyneck","2017-08-03T21:21:26.873Z","...But why's the rum gone?","<p>My first Lego set ever. It has only 17 parts. 13 parts without counting minifigure. 13 parts! And those 13 parts have given me so much fun! I would give this set 5/5. And you know what? I&#39;ll do it. Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p><strong>Minifig:</strong></p>

<p>A happy pirate with an eye patch and facial hair. He wears a blue shirt and black triangle hat. When I was a child, it was obvious to me that because the hat was black, this Pirate was a Captain.</p>

<p><strong>Main build:</strong></p>

<p>The main build is very big because it is a whoooole Carribean island with rocks and some foliage. This is for me the essence of Lego. There are only a few parts used for this build and yet it is still very interesting. There are 2 yellow plates for sand, gray bricks for rocks with clever use of headlight brick as a plant holder, mentioned plants, barrel to hold the pirate loot and of course THE Pirate Flag.</p>

<p><strong>Additional parts:</strong></p>

<p>We have saber and pistol (with one bullet, I guess) for the pirate minifig. It&#39;s more than enough for such small set. However, at least one gold coin would make it even better.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said, great use of parts, for such small set we get not only bricks and plates but also plants, barrel, and some accessories as well.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>Great set. It is reflecting all that Lego about is. Using a bit of imagination and we can come out with an infinite amount of stories about our little Pirate and his lookout. And for me, it will always have additional sentimental value :)</p>
