"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-14T15:07:59.217Z","Not as good as other Exo-Force","The Fire Vulture is not the prettiest battle machine and the whole set is a bit unstable.

Pros;
Cool flamethrower.
Engine looks good.

Cons:
Unstable.
Lacks any big blasters.
Claw comes off a lot.

Buy if you're building a robot army or like flamethrowers.
Don't buy if you like battle machines with BIG laser cannons instead of two handheld ones on the shoulders.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-18T19:31:15.59Z","the only worth while old exo force kit","this set is probabilly the only good original exo force set because it actually looks like it can fly. its got that big moter in the back that helps it. the weapons arnt that cool but the machine is actually decent and the fig is ok. his legs are too chubby. its the best old exo force set but far from perfect. 6/10",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2009-02-04T18:09:27.623Z","Nice pieces","This set is ok. I like the pieces, and the flame thrower is very cool, too. I really like the robot, and I would like more of them. On to P's and C's.

Pros:

Robot
Claws
Flame thrower
rotor piece

Cons:
Flimsy (Like all exo-force)


This set isn't the first set I would choose, obviously, but the pieces are cool and it is fun to play with. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-08-01T16:02:21.17Z","Cool, some flaws, but still very cool","This is an awesome mech, and since it is more aerial than brute force, it is a match for both of the human mechs. Sure the other mech is big and cool, but the machine gun is on the chest, ON THE CHEST, so the other one lacks the defensive strategy this one has. The lack of a solid, airtight cockpit is an argument easily lost, since the pilot is a robot and this is not intended as a spaceship or as a submarine, so there! The claw is cool, but in its position is useless for melee combat, but ban easily sever the vital &quot;power cables&quot;. The LED system was cool, but was hard to use and the cables made it impractical. The large turbine is also cool, but the blade doesn't spin, the whole thing does. The design for the body is pretty sturdy and looks really cool, plus the robot is also really cool, but lacks the red axle that gives it eyes! On to the flamethrower, which is cool, but also has its flaws. First off, whats with the spare tubing on the side? Next, the weapon itself looks really cool, with a gas tank, sprayer nozzle, and an ignitor. The mech doesn't have missile launchers, but instead has lasers, which is better for payability since they can be removed and used as weapons if the pilot finds itself grounded.

Also a great buy, so why hesatate, if the price is right, get one!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-29T14:23:39.28Z","the start","This set convinced me to get the fortress so that is a huge plus however it does have its flaws so for this review I've decided to do Pros and Cons

Pros:
Flamethrower is great
Nice design for body
Cool thing on its back

Cons:
Claw is pointless
Legs and arms are too small",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"tkettle9719","2012-01-04T18:10:11.383Z","Exo Force Villains Rock!","<p>I got this set for myself from Target at regular price, and think that it is a very nice set, something to rival the Stealth Hunter from the same year and mech type. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The wheel is very cool, as are the colors on it and throughout the model. <br></li><li>-The flamethrower is ingeniously made, and the light brick just makes this look even greater. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The tan socket pieces are a strange, off-looking choice.<br></li><li>-I'm not the biggest fan of the claw, either.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is an interesting set, and one that I like. It goes great against the Stealth Hunter, and is in the same class as it. I highly recommend this. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
