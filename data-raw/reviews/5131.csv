"legomaniac","2006-01-25T18:11:17Z","good but could be better","I like the light up brick. The robot looks like a bionicle. The mart I realy dislike is the color of the turbines. The black and silver mixed together looks very cheap. The guns on the rear turbines are loose and move when I play with it and the light brick should be connected to the body it falls off too easily.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-15T14:18:35.653Z","O.K","To start this review off i shall point out that this set is quikly being replaced with 2007 sets,so i recomend buying it before it is replaced completly.

Pros:
Engines look cool.
Includes a green devastator.
Has a firing missle.

Cons:
Ariel falls off a lot.
Whole set is fragile.
Missle is very sensiteve.
Engine laser cannon things spin all over the place.

Buy if you like the robots or are building an Air Force.
Don't buy if you don't like things that fly at supersonic speeds.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"reidak49","2007-08-07T20:46:44.677Z","big bad robot fligher","i bought this set for 20 bucks at wal mart it was worth it the sonic phantom design is basicly a gun

"vezon8764","2008-10-05T22:20:54.86Z","NOT A TRUE BATTLE MACHINE!","It doesn't have any of the Exo-Force movable arm pieces, so it's not really a battle machine. It's still fun to play with. Perfect for swooshing around the Sentai Fortress set.
Pros:
4 turbines
lots of guns
glow brick
cannon
Cons:
cannon trigger is really sensitive
you really have to pull the trigger to make the brick light up
guns are hard to position
See you next review!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dk_devilkid","2009-11-27T10:49:39.983Z","Say ""Yeah"" for flying robots!","The Sonic Phantom was my first Exo-Force along with Grand Titan. It comes with two front spinning turbines, a nice addition. It also comes with rotating blasters, a firing missile, and a little red gun that lights up. It also has a handle underneath where you can have a safety grip when flying it around and shoot the missile at the same time.

Pros:
Green Devastator robot minifig.
wind turbines.
firing missile, red gun, and rotating blasters.
rare tube pieces on the side.

Cons:
none

This an absolutely brilliant set that would be a great addition to a collector's shelf.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2010-11-16T13:12:06.077Z","Would make a great podracer","<p>The <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sonic Phantom</span></span>
set (7704) is a LEGO Exo-Force set which came out in 2006. It comes
with 1 minifig and 215 pieces. This set does include decals.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigure:</span><br><br></p><ul><li>Robot: The robot is a very basic robot minifig with a transparent yellow torso.

</p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><strong>Sonic Phantom:</strong><br><br>
<ul><li>The Sonic Phantom is awsome. It comes with 2 awsome turbines in the front and two laser guns on the turbines which are attached to the fins of this model which can be swiveled. The laser guns can be swiveled aswell. The antenna on the back can be moved, too. The front turbines have some cool laser guns and the engines look pretty neat aswell. The Sonic Phantom has a bick flick-missle which shoots very well. The speeder comes with a nice light brick which has a nice laser. The only problem is that this light brick isn't attached to any studs so it keeps falling down if you want to move this model up or down. The Sonic Phantom also has a nice handle where you can grab this set for easier playability. This set would also make a great podracer for Star Wars stopmotions if you're taking off the lasers and the flick-missle.<br></li></ul>

"AETerry","2011-04-26T12:25:04.47Z","Sonic Phantom Review","<p>Overall, Exo-Force just didn't greatly appeal to me. I did pick this particular set off a clearance shelf at a local Grocery Outlet Store. Price wise, it was good. There are a lot of good features to be found in the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one, I do like the Robot minifigure. In retrospect, I think I would have liked to have picked up more of the Exo-Force series then what I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The turbine elements on this set are great and do make for a good design of a ship. I've since long taken this set apart to make use of the pieces in other MOCs.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
