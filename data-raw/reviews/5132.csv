"toplessjeep","2006-03-23T04:57:22Z","Simple yet great","I love this set. One of my favorites. Originally bought it because it was cheap and figured I would add another one to the collection. Once I got it together I absolutly loved it. So much play value for such a simple kit. The alternate is awsome. Had a weak spot but was easily fixed with a 2x4 plate. I am thinking about getting another one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ruidp","2006-09-22T17:59:48Z","good small set","This is a very good small set, it is the cheapest of the exo-force theme and probably one of the best in spite of the small size. Lego says his function is to repair the other machines but it has no tools, only guns!?...
Good color scheme, cool minifig. Very good for making poses as it has lots of hinges, and sturdier than what I expected.
I am not a big fan of Exo-force and I only bought this set because of the cheap price, but after I assembled it, I have to say I had a positive surprise.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2007-02-03T16:16:38.52Z","Nice small mech!","Uplink is cool, because all the small mechs are cool! Lego was really thinking smart when they designed the small mechs, because they are compact, sleek, and very poseable! Uplink is probably the second best (gate defender is the best IMO), but Uplink still has some good parts, cool weapons, and my second favorite Exo-force human minifigure! I especially love that they found another use for the almost useless NHL shoulder armor! Overall, A nice kit, and it's perfect for an introduction to exo-force! 4/5 - Great!

P.s. The online alternate model is SWEET!
P.p.s. For much more playability, buy Uplink and the robot small mech, Sentry, at the same time!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Paul007","2007-04-24T09:13:06.467Z","Very Cheap!","This set is one of the worst in the Exo-force line.  I give it a 9/10 though because it is very easy to modify, and the price makes it a good buy.  It is easy to equip this little Exo-force wannabe with a sheild and cockpit, providing you own the pieces.  The weopons are also easily modified, and with several minutes of work and several pieces from your collection, you can have this cheapo set looking like grand titan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"reidak49","2007-09-01T09:03:42.787Z","nice","as you know this is the cheapist way to get the ryo minifigure and a small mech it looks like a cross between sentry and sentry 2 and the arms looks a little unarmored but there are the hated stickers and and a annoying ententa  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-03-04T01:51:47.793Z","BAD","This set is a rubbish. It's just cockpit, legs, shoulders, and weapons.
The shoulders armor is just a piece, it will be better if it was built by more bricks. The weapons is good, but is exactly the same with Sentry's, one laser cannon and two rockets. The legs were good. The cockpit didn't have any armor at all, one lucky shot by a robot and exo-force will have a rest-in-peace session on the fortress. The orange colour is also bad, why on Earth would you want to have some orange colour in the middle of battle?",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2008-07-17T16:56:49.497Z","Behold the Orange terror!","Although this set is pretty much extinct in the majority of shops I still think it is a nice little set that is very cheap and can be purchased numerous times to build an army of Uplinks.Now to thepros and cons.

Pros-
-A nice bright Orange,
-Cool dual missle launcher and laser,
-Cheap
-Nice army builder even though its a type of medic robot,
-Comes with Ryo.

Cons-
-A little bit flimsy.

Buy if- you like cheap, colourful or cool robots.
Don't buy if- You like big sets or playsets.

It has a cool laser cannon, and computer, rocket launcher (a little loose but still good), Manga minifig, clever legs and feet, a cool colour scheme, just the look of it is great, get it now while ExoForce lasts, it's sets like these that make me sad Exo-Force is being discontinued.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-10T14:33:17.013Z","Simple","This is one of the first, from 2006, and don't have some pieces from other themes like bionicle. The arms of the machine are little, and have more weapons than hands. The feet are made with pieces different than bionicle, and the legs too. The minifigure is also different, the hair is big, and the head have a strange face to likes the ryo character. The orange parts can be additions on armies' machines.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BlackRabbit","2008-04-12T15:23:51.827Z","only good to be blowen up by sentreys","
its not a great set . theres  terrible colour scheme ,weapons,and design.though that can be fixedby putting your own armour peices on and it would go well with the  Sentai Headquarters , and gate assult theres really no other use for the parts in this set its still nice set to have.


pros
you get a few rockets

cons
orange peices 
really basic weapon
minifigs orange suit is ugly
very hollow

like the title says its only ,good to be blowen up by sentreys, get it if you like orange or you are a collector.

"rabk295","2009-02-04T18:12:23.577Z","Average","Pieces are nice, but this is probably the most flimsy of all the exo-force sets. I'm disappointed with Lego for not somehow figuring out how to make it stronger. Like all of the sets, this one has a sweet minifig, but unless you're collecting minifigs, I wouldn't recommend this set. At six dollars or whatever, it's a waste of money.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-19T22:15:27.34Z","Surprisingly good, although still not good enough...","i got this for my bday and i like it!

pros:
cheap
can be easily modified

cons:
too weak to combat things like fire vulture etc
looks skeletal and unfinished
pieces are floppy

still, good for your collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"speeddash","2009-08-05T14:24:46.64Z","not bad!","OK the set its self is good and it has a plasma gun but lets get down to the pros and cons


 pros 
 
 it has a rare foot piece
 
 a plasma gun

 some rockets

 a antenna 

    
  cons
  the cockpit is a little unstable
   
  the rockets come of easily 
   
  other than than that it is good I give it a 10 of 10

"AETerry","2011-05-05T15:55:08.32Z","Uplink Review","<p>As I stated in another review, there weren't a lot of the Exo-Force sets that I picked up and in retrospect, I would have liked to have made more of an effort to get more of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $5 for the set, the price tag makes it easy to have picked up and gotten Uplink, even if on the grounds of Impluse Buy. The minifigure is pretty cool, another reason I'd have liked to have gotten more Exo-Force, for both the human and Robot minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to Sentry, the placement of Uplink's Antenae isn't so obtrusive for me, I'd have still done something far smaller, but it's less in the way. The build is descent enough for a Power Armor/Robot Mech type build. And the weapons on the arms are good builds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you like the idea of Mechs and Power Armor builds for Minis, the Exo-Force theme offered up a variety of different builds and ideas to go by. So this sets okay, there's not too much to praise about it and not much to hate on either. There's stickers, love 'em or hate 'em, they do show up with LEGO sets.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5

<ul><li>-All of the armor and weapons are all basic and superb, and the feet made of all basic bricks is fantastic.<br></li><li>-The little computer in the cockpit area is an excellent little detail.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The arms droop down after a while due to the weapons.<br></li><li>-The gray brick for the feet is not the best choice, and the shoulders have gaps where you can clearly see the blue connector bush piece.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This little mech is inexpensive and great for any mech collection. It's value shouldn't be discriminated just because it's small. Get one, and see for yourself.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
