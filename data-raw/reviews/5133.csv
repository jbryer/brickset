"FellintoOblivion","2006-03-09T10:03:01Z","","I will only list the single thing I didnt like about this model.

~Antenna
     It bugs me that the antenna is attached to the shoulder which means that if you point the missile up the antenna is sticking straigh back and out which make it rather obtrusive.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"toplessjeep","2006-03-16T03:47:18Z","Not too bad","I like this one. Not my favorite, but its got its high points. I have to agree with the other reviewer about the antenna. Should be mounted somewhere other then sholder. I love the way the sholders are mounted. It lets you fold them back in a way to give the impressing the suit is powerded down. As with the other robot mechs this one looks much better with out the stickers. The alt model is simple to construct, very sturdy, just not very cool. It does however let you have a new type mech. Combine this with its original form, and the mech that comes with the gate set and you have three different types of mini robot mechs. I do love the laser cannon. Amazingly simple, yet very effective.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lewa_rocks","2007-04-26T00:03:53.077Z","Nice for the price","Its good but not as good as the Uplink   Good: sholder folding down is cool.   The gun is sweet.  The iron drone is cool.
Bad: intena is on the sholder it always falles off !!!

over all its a cool set and pretty fun to play with. Its a nice add to your Exo-Force collection",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-03-04T01:59:11.153Z","GO, ROBOTS!!","Yeah, Sentry rocks! When Uplink is rubbish, Sentry is very cool! The laser cannon was very creative in design, and the rocket pods is good. The cockpit is open, but it doesn't matter, since the robots will just make more Iron Drones.  The best part of this set was the colour, I like the sand brown very much! This set is excellent for those of you who wants to be an army builder, but doesn't want to spend much money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-10T14:38:03.437Z","Cool and simple","This is different from the others little, have too pieces different from other themes, but some from older sets too, like the pieces on the front of the feet, used also in the first racers. The colors are another cool things, this brown-like color is different from another schemes. The Robot is the same of others, but in a color to combine with the machine. Little missiles pieces are included.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legomarsfan","2008-05-23T13:34:23.607Z","nice","this set is one of the first exo-force sets and its good the colors are nice and the weapons but its antena isnt  in a good position i mean ho would want to move an antena with the armbut you can slide a little the plate on the back and place the antena there but overall its a nice set and if you like mechs and dont have much money you should buy it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jim_Java","2008-07-31T15:32:56.733Z","Cool for 3 bucks...","I picked up this set for 3 or 4 bucks from 5Below, along with a water gun. I didn't actually know anything about Exo-Force (Since then, I've learned a little about it), but I had a gift card, and it looked cool. 
Now I've had it for a while, and it's still pretty cool. The Sentry is basically  the Machine version of the human's Uplink-a small set you can get a bunch of if you want to build an army of Exo-Force figures. It doesn't take long to build, and it's not complicated. Well, obviously something of this size wouldn't be enourmously complicated. It does look neat, though. It has two nonfuctional weapons, one on each &quot;arm&quot; (Well, actually it doesn't have so much arms as shoulders with weapons attached). One is a rocket launcher, which has two little missiles, the same one used in the new SLAVE I, except smaller. The other arm is a laser cannon, basically the coolest part of the set. It also comes with a drone pilot, of course.
That's basically it. However, there are two small problems. One, the set has a tendency to fall over backwards. This is solved easily by rotating the legs away from the front a little.
The other problem is the platform. Because of the way it's designed, it can fall off if not handled correctly. This can be a little frustrating, but it usually only happens once or twice.
In conclusion: Great for a cheap price (They may still be carrying them at 5Below), but not as cool as the bigger sets. (Well, did you EXPECT it to have as much articulation?)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2009-02-04T18:19:17.7Z","blah.","This set is very much like uplink. It is very fragile, but I like the gun selection on this more than uplink's. I wouldn't recommend buying this though. A waste of six bucks. If you want to spend six dollars, spend it on something different then this waste-of-your-time build. Not worth it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-29T14:33:58.28Z","Better than Uplink","This set was everything that Uplink could have been. It's a little shorter but looks less skelatle (I don't have clue how to spell that Word) The gun looks cool but the missile aren't as good as Uplink's. The set as a whole looks nice and I like how it has the small red technic piece in the robots head. The antennae wasn't exactly neccasary but it can just be taken out. A nice and cheap set which is a must have for Exo-force fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"clone_commander_trainrex","2008-12-17T06:38:48.077Z","it walks","I am not a fan of exo force but I got it from brickmaster so it was okay.  This set is so cool.  It has a great gun on one side and two mistles on the other.  The pieces are cool and the stickers are well placed.  Also it is inexpensive son get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-19T22:20:53.327Z","Better than uplink!","In my opinion, this is better than uplink!
this is primarily because of the shoulder armour and the fusion cannon thing

pros:
iron drone
cool
good armour
easily modifiable
powerful weapons

cons:
tends to become 'floppy'
sometimes falls over

still, a great addition to anyone's collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-04-06T15:52:30.513Z","Call in the Sentries.","Here is the Sentry, ready to blast its way! 

This set includes one Iron Drone. 

It is a very cheap set and worth the money.

It was my first Exo-force.

It was built very well.

If you are very interested in exoforce then you should buy at least one of these.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-05-04T12:52:21.727Z","Sentry Review","<p>There aren't very many of the Exo-Force sets that I picked up when this theme came out originally and in retrospect, the more I look at the pics and think about it, I'd have liked to have gotten more of them then what I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The smaller builds like Uplink and Sentry came in at around $5, making for a decent price on a set. The builds are fairly good too, robot walkers or power armor for a Sci-Fi theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Sentry you get a copper Robot minifigure that looks decent. the arm weapons for cannon and missle are cool. The anteannae on this seems too obtrusive, perhaps if LEGO had put in something smaller for the design, it wouldn't look so glaring.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
