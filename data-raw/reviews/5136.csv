Well, some girls.   Well, I mean girly little girls.

Problem is that there's not that much you can do with a single set.  As with all Belville sets, it's a treasure trove of unusual colors and pieces you get very few of in the average $10 Lego set -- food, accessories, vegetation, and animals.  Not to mention that staple of the Belville line -- sparkly things.

With the picket fences and the two main juniorized tower pieces, you can build just about what they show on the box and the instructions -- the shell of a little palace along with a kind of picnic on the lawn, with makeup table.  Nothing really does anything, and there is basically no building to do.

With three or four of these sets, together with a selection of general Lego elements in pink (if you can find them) or white (much more likely), it's possible to create quite a nice Cinderella castle, but you have to be able to show that little girl how to do the Lego basics, because she's not going to learn them from this little set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
