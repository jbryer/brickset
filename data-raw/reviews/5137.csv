An matoran of 2006, Velika really have usable pieces and much pieces for a matoran, overall. This set includes a mask Komau from onewa and two earthshock drills from whenua, doing a well maded combination. The Velika legs and arms are short but are playable and this set is easy to play and have fun. Another feature is the color scheme. Overall Velika is cool to built (also easy to build) and play. I rate this set 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T13:34:33.857Z","Pretty good.","This is a pretty good set.  I like the weapons, legs, and mask but the arms are a little hard to control.  He is a really cool matoran.  Make sure you have all of the Voya-Nui Matoran because it is fun playing with all of them!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-24T08:48:16.843Z","I love his tools","I also like the new way his hands are positioned on his body.  It's very new.  Also, his Mask of Mind Control is also a nice mask for this little guy.  Surprisingly, this guy is very playable, and this is from a voice of experience.  I used to play with my Bionicles, but nowadays I don't do that as much as I set them up in mock battles.  I got him, by the way, at the Lego store in Downtown Disney.  Anyway, on to the statistics.

Pros:

New arm position

Mask of Mind Control

LOVE those tools!!

Playability

Body design

Cons:

None!!

Go get Velika!  He'll be your favorite Matoran right off the bat!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
