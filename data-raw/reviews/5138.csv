"legozander","2006-08-26T04:24:37Z","Really cool","My dad came home from germany with a nice surprise for me and my brother i got kazi and a rhotaka pack and my bro got a zamor pack and a rahaga. But anyway back to the review.Kazi is quite cool and he comes with handy parts and a quite a few spare parts for such a small set.The fact that you cant move the legs is a bit of a problem but they can be modified so they can move like the other voya nui matoran.All the parts in kazi are not new and have been used in other sets before so dont be expecting new bits or something like that.His mask is exactly the same as toa Nujus and if your thinking whether you should buy kazi or not get him now. He is well worth your money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-28T16:41:21.34Z","Good builted for a matoran","This white matoran of Voya Nui is good builted for a simple matoran and also have a considerable size. This set includes 25 usable pieces and also a white mask from nuju and two guurahk's weapons, that be fixed very well in this matoran, and do a good design. The set is also really playable, much easy to build and to have some fun (comparable to small sets that is good). Overall i rate the matoran Kazi 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bionicle101","2008-06-29T11:46:47.39Z","The best Voya Nui Matoran!","Okay, I got this set in the 2006 Matoran collection. When I built Kazi, I knew he'd be the best. 

Pros:

Nuju's mask

Lots of &quot;Playability&quot;

Good weapons

Tall for Voya Nui Matoran


Cons:

Stupid head piece (Just a hand piece!)



Overall, a 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This figure has some nice parts: We get two weapons, two nice looking 
feet and another mask which we've seen on Toa Metru Nuju. All pieces 
are great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for 
sure.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we don't have to complain about stickers as well.</p><h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8722-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted.
 I think the design of this figure is really simple and cool - even if it doesn't 
have a lot of play features. As I told you </span>in the beginning: This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The reusing of Nuju's old headpiece is awesome.<br></li><li>-The clever use of smaller accessory pieces from other sets is used to great effect here.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-He seems really short, even for a Matoran.<br></li><li>-The use of a regular standard headpiece with eyeslots would have been a better choice.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a nice little ice Matoran, with whom I am well pleased with. It's inexpensive, small, and somewhat cute. Buy a couple if you don't have one.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
