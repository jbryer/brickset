"greg_duncan","2006-01-02T18:32:13Z","great little set","these matoran seem to be very MOCish. they are all unique,except the brown and the blach one.they have no eyes for some reason, but design is great and the tools are a good choice. the combiners are good looking, and the instructions include part numbers, for replacement.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-27T17:56:57.327Z","Le Matoran of Voya Nui","Piruk is an le matoran, that like the other matoran of 2006 have some usable pieces and also differences of the building and playability. This set have awesome green color scheme and silver claws, easy to play with and the cool mask Mahiki. Like Balta, Piruk do not is much playable on the legs and is really small, but is very good in building, piece differnce and playability with the head and arms. Overall, i rate Piruk 5/5.

He is one of my favorite matoran!  The Piraka better beware of the air matoran, or else they will have claw marks in them!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Dragon_fire","2008-06-13T11:56:04.39Z","tough little guy","This is the only one of the voya nui matoran that I have however, I have seen the others and I think that this is the best out of the lot, however the combination models look awesome (pity I can't build them due to lack of matoran!)

He has some great parts, very useful, his claws are wicked and his mask is my favourite out of the six. he gets a five despite the fact that his legs are a little limited and he is a hunchback (lol!), still, he has great playability (my piruk is now riding my kikanalo while holding a grenade made ot of toa nuve shoulder armour) and is and all round great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Derek2441","2008-11-07T21:20:11.077Z","cool","I got this set for christmas 3 years ago along with the 5 other matoran in this collection. Now for the review:

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-22T08:08:06.78Z","Cute Liddle Le-Matoran","I got this set early '07 in an Albertsons (I still don't know how I pulled THAT one off).  As soon as I got home I built him rather quickly, and I wasn't disappointed at all when he was finished.  I love the design, but the only thing I have to complain about is the way his head joint is designed.  He can't look up without turning his whole body upward.  Otherwise, great set.  Let's look at the stats.

Pros:

Claws

Matau's Mask

Design

Unique from other '06 sets

Arms from the Rahaga

Cons:

Can't look up

I was very hapy with this set, and if you want this, then what the heck are you waiting for??  Go get it!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-03T22:27:32.967Z","Piruk shall blow up Brutaka","Piruk is a really cool Matoran. Actually, most green Bionicles are cool.

Pros:
Comeback of the Matau mask
Claws
Nice build
Transperant lime green fangs on shoulders
Feet

Cons:
NONE!

Piruk is a really great Matoran like all the Voya Nui Matoran but Piruk is my favourite.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-04-26T15:21:49.437Z","Piruk, last sane Le-Matoran","Piruk has old Matoran feet, dark green. He has Rahaga/Matoran arms and legs. His mask/helmet is from Toa Metru Matau, a nice comeback. One of the best Matoran before the '08-'09 bodys.  He is a Le-Matoran that likes the jungle. He lives in the village and is not one of the Voya Nui Matoran who traveled down to the Pit and formed Mahri Nui. Most of the green Bionicles are great, and this is one of them. If you go to http://www.bioniclestory.com you can see movies, biographies, listen to podcasts, play Toa Mahri games, and a lot more cool stuff. Does anyone else live in southern Indina? I do go to a Church of Christ.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
