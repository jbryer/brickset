"Gus_263","2008-02-27T18:07:41Z","Small but also cool onu matoran","Garan is one of the most small matoran ever created, but is also playable. Like all the 2006 matoran he features an different form of building. This set includes the mask Ruru and two blades, easy to play. His head, legs and arms are playable more than the other matoran of 2006 due to the form of build. Garan do not have much pieces and is very small but is in overall, very good. I rate this set 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"vexorian","2010-01-04T22:03:33.42Z","Nice for parts","If you can get it for 3 or less USD and you are into building bionicle MOCs stuff then it is in my opinion a good deal to buy these voya-matoran. At least for Garan I was happy to see the parts:

To sum up:
* 3 rahaga/bohrok feet.
* 2 SILVER bohrok teeth! This is hard to notice in pics and it seems all the voya-matoran come with bohrok teeth in a rare color.
* 2 silver weapons, ok that's a little generic but these specific ones are sort of cool. 
* Useful articulation parts.
* The mask is not half bad.

Be warned that unlike what some promotional pics and the box may suggest, he does not come with semi-transparent eyes for the head.

I really just bought him for the parts. However, he is so small without looking lame that I think that if you got the collection of these guys you could use them to decorate a small shelf. 

They also have a combiner, some sort of spider thing that seems to be nice. (I like the fact they managed to have a symmetrical combiner for once)

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This figure has some nice parts: We get two weapons, two nice looking 
feet and another mask which we've seen on Toa Metru Whenua. All pieces 
are great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for 
sure.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we don't have to complain about stickers as well.</p>

 I think the design of this figure is really simple and cool - even if it is a small set and even if it doesn't 
have a lot of play features. As I told you </span>in the beginning: This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"jonathanfrye1999","2016-04-04T14:32:35.677Z","Garan, My first Bionicle ","<p>Hello! I&#39;m jonathanfrye1999, and today I will be reviewing set&nbsp;8724, Garan. This&nbsp;was my first ever Bionicle&nbsp;set, and in my opinion, one of the greatest Matoran&nbsp;sets ever released by Lego.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Garan was packaged in a small cardboard box with an image displaying him in an action pose on the front. The instructions were printed on a single folded sheet, but also included part of instructions for&nbsp;a combi model including&nbsp;him and two other Matoran from the series.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No new molds. Interesting pieces include the blades and Whenua&nbsp;Metru&#39;s&nbsp;mask.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was quite interesting and unique for a Matoran. The Bohrok foot&nbsp;utilized as the body core makes for an interesting building technique, and how the hip sockets and Bohrok eyes contribute to the shape of the body intrigues me.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Garan is a small figure, measuring about&nbsp;4&quot; high. He is disproportionate with big feet, a big head and a small body, but he is highly articulate, with 9 points of articulation, and can hit many awesome poses. A minor con is that his arms connect to his shoulders&nbsp;at an awkward angle, but this is easily fixed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I love this little guy. The building technique I learned (putting a Bohrok foot in the center of the body and using the exposed joint as the head&#39;s socket) has proved useful in dozens of Matoran&nbsp;mocs, and his parts are useful for mocing. I highly recommend this set.&nbsp;If you find this set for a good price on EBay, don&#39;t hesitate on picking it up.</p>
