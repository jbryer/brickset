"Gus_263","2008-02-27T17:52:05.717Z","Ta Matoran of Voya Nui","This set is an matoran, that have 22 usable pieces. Like all the matoran of 2006 Balta is playable, but the legs unfortunately are no much and are small. Balta is different from the other matorans no only in colors, mask and weapons, all the matoran of 2006 are different one to others. Balta features some pieces with different colors to the original red, colors like silver, gray and orange. This set includes also the huna mask and two air katanas. Overall, Balta is good builted and playable for a matoran. I rate so, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-06T10:09:48.053Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Balta Review","<p>This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This figure has some cool parts: We get two swords, two nice looking feet and another mask which we've seen on Toa Metru Vakama. All pieces are great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we don't have to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8725-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. I really like the design of this figure - even if this doesn't have a lot of play features. As I told you in the beginning: This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
