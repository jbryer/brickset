"Gus_263","2008-02-28T16:48:01.107Z","Ga matoran of Voya Nui","I think that set very good for a matoran due to the playability, like the other matoran of Voya Nui and also due to other usable pieces. The mask, from the 2004 water toa (nokama) and two blades be fixed very well on the matoran and also do an cool effect on the matoran. The size is considerable, but the white feet be strange to a blue matoran, and if the blue matoran have a mask with another blue color effect, it be worst. So, i rate Dalu in overall 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This figure has some nice parts: We get two daggers, two nice looking 
feet and another mask which we've seen on Toa Metru Nokama. All pieces 
are great for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for 
sure.</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we don't have to complain about stickers as well.</p>

I think the design of this figure is really cool - even if it doesn't have a lot of play features. As I told you </span>in the beginning: This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
