"DarkLordMakuta","2007-07-23T22:33:03.81Z","Freaking cool!","Axonn is by far my favourite titan set to date! There is not a single thing bad to say about him. Although he is a tad short, his height and axe make him very Dwarf-like, and NOBODY tosses a Dwarf! His hands are quite cool, and his axe is awesome. I recommend this set to anyone who... well, anyone. BUY AXONN!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros sweet axe, this baby is humongus
his mask is very classy looking,
HE HAS FINGERS WOOHOO!. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A SET WITH ACTUAL FINGERS?!
sorry about that
the clor scheme is very balanced and now the con's
Short and i mean it an inika can see the top of his head
his legs do'nt bed all the way in the back,
the axe head falls off a lot
and those arms cant stay up very long because of their tremendos weight.
but hey small price to pay for the shortestset sweetest titan out there",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-26T13:12:43.92Z","Protector of the Matoran","Axonn is one of the best bionicle titans ever created. His colors (silver and red) are awesome. His axe, is very good builted and also his hands with fingers. The Axonn's Mask is very well designed, like his armors. He is smaller than Brutaka but is also cool, in playability, to do creations and is fun. Like the 2006 titans, Axonn also have the pneumatic system on the legs that works very well for titans. His feet are great and good builted, the legs and the arm are basically the same, doing that he looks like more strong. The other systems of the legs are great, doing that he really likes more an titan. I rate Axonn 5/5, a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BrickBob09","2011-09-11T15:52:42.96Z","Axonn- Best of the Bionicles","In my opinion, Axonn is the greatest Bionicle set. From his huge axe down to his small fingers, every aspect of this set is amazing.<div><br></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>Axonn doesn't have many unique parts, but does have his mask and axe blades. The mask is great, especially the point at the top which makes him look taller. The axe blades are also very nice indeed, mainly because of the size which helps to portray Axonn's mighty strength. Most of the parts are either red or grey, making a good colour scheme.</div><div><br></div><h4>Model</h4><div>The model is generally very sturdy, although can be top heavy in some poses. However about from that, the set is really well designed. His armour fits together to create a great look and the sheer size makes him look very powerful.</div><div>One part of the amazing design is Axonn's hands. Not only are they huge, helping towards showing his strength, but he has actually fingers. To my knowledge, Axonn is only one of two Bionicles to feature poseable fingers. It may not sound like much but they really do make a difference when it comes down to posing or just playing,</div><div><br></div><h4>Playability</h4><div>Axonn is lots of fun to play with. He is highly poseable, has a fantastic design and just looks great among other Bionicles. The size of his axe gives a great playing aspect to him and makes him look like the strongest Bionicle you could find- you certainly wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him!</div><div>I'm sure everyone from die-hard Bionicle collectors to the occasional LEGO buyer will enjoy playing with this set.</div><div><br></div><h4>Price</h4><div>At the original retail price this set was an absolute steal, but sadly now, due to the high demand of this set, second hand prices have shot through the roof. If you are lucky enough to find it at a bargain, don't&nbsp;hesitate&nbsp;to grab- before someone else does. You'll be kicking yourself if you let this one slip through your fingers!</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary</h4><div>I highly recommend this set. It's&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;my favourite Bionicle. He'll fit in with any Bionicle collection, big or small. He may not be the biggest Bionicle titian, but he's certainly the best.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
