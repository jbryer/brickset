"greg_duncan","2006-07-21T09:49:57Z","incredible!","Simply the best. Brutaka is by far the best titan in recent years, besides being one of the tallest. He is great for parts, especially gold ones as there are a lot in this set. The leg construction is great and sturdy, and the body is very solid. His mask and blades are huge and suit him well. Definitely worth checking out!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legozander","2007-01-05T05:30:32Z","Wowser.","I got brutaka for christmas when I heard he was gonna be featured in the 2007 storyline. (Something I wasnt expecting.) When he is built and standing up straight he makes a Toa inika look quite small! Brutaka includes massive silver blades as well as a large gold kanohi and plenty of gold armour. Also he includes two gold Garan weapons! As well as just looking plain cool where ever you put him Brutaka certanly lives up to the word titan... So overall Brutaka is a titan worth your money. Get him if you can! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lewa_rocks","2007-04-25T03:40:47.78Z","So cool im drooling.","This guy is realy cool he is big mean looking and awesome he is the coolest of my whole collection. I like him a lot you should get him (if you see him onsale buy him). His doble swords are cool and his mask is just as cool. He has small swords hiding behind his back. The claws are realy good for MOCing (MOC = my own creation) and i luve to MOC. For people that like to MOC or play by the story or even make up a story he is great for all. For 20$ us doller its great. He is realy fun to pose to replay storyline battles and to MOC with. He is worth the 20$ and if you find him onsale you dont have a choice hes awesome so why not.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarkLordMakuta","2007-07-23T22:42:08.13Z","Very cool!","Though not quite as cool as Axonn, Brutaka is a very well-rounded set, and a very fun build. Also, he is big. Very big. The feet are very interesting, as are his extra &quot;arms&quot;, though I keep those folded up in the back. His colour scheme works well, lending to a Drow Elf kind of feel, which counters the Dwarf Axonn quite well. I just don't care for his blade arm; one hand has claws and the other just doesn't. Overall, he's a really cool set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-12T12:49:11.747Z","Brutaka the Might titan","Really i think that Brutaka is one of the best bionicle sets ever and my first titan. Brutaka features lots of important pieces, good to make creations. Some of these pieces like the Mask and the double blades are used in few sets after and are hard to find. I like much the pneumatics colors and details, that make Brutaka looks like more a titan. This set is so much tall next to othe bionicle sets, and also good designed. Brutaka have more two minor blades and golden armors, to increase the fun with this set. I rate it 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I think it's time for another BIONICLE review now and this time I'll review Brutaka. Brutaka was a good friend of Axxon but when the piraka came to the island Voya Nui he changed and joined the piraka and became evil.<br><br>The set is a cool built and I remember that I got it for Christmas a few years ago. For a Christmas gift I can't really complain about this figure. I really like his big staff and the mask. Brutaka doesn't fall down that easy as well. The golden armor makes this guy looking much cooler. It's a good set to have and to play with. It's a very big figure. In fact: It's bigger than a toa figure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Capricorn","2013-08-26T22:00:28.103Z","One of the Best Titans Available!","<p>Brutaka has got to be one of the best Bionicle titans ever released. He is from 2006, with 193 pieces. He was worth 20 dollars in stores, so it is totally worth it money-wise... Today if you want to get him you should be prepared to shell out 40. But that cost is totally worth it. Theres almost no flaws, and the ones that exist are not even obnoxious. Well, lets get on to the review!<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Brutaka includes a lot of nice technic pieces. His main body is consisted of a bar, with the piraka torso and vahki hips connecting. He comes with a ton of parts in a pearl gold color, and armor his entire body. His claws are just piraka feet, and his feet are also piraka feet. The gold is inset with the average dark blue color, but it looks extremely nice with the gold. He has a lot of awesome parts, like the golden piraka kneepads, and golden Toa Metru kneepads. He has two golden pipes connecting his arms, and a billion golden bohrok eyes armoring his entire body. He also has two blue Toa Metru feet, on the sides of his upper legs. He has two Kikanalo faces armoring his back, or used as daggers. His blade is just a generic blade, nothing too fancy there, but they're good to own. Theres also a Visorak foot on his chest, as well as three... what are they, ice skates?... as his center toes and his lower body armor. A particularly nice piece included is a golden Hordika foot, which is actually really cool looking and would be great for building. Too bad the set only comes with one and uses it as a chestplate. The mask itself is also really nice, it fits the set perfectly. On any other set, the mask is gigantic and bad-looking, considering its uncommon gold color. But on Brutaka, its absolutely perfect, and fits the ""spiky"" theme that I seem to have noticed. Two downfalls of the parts happen to be the fact that it included four of the funny-shaped rubber hands, used on his legs. Mine have cracked, but they seem to be doing pretty good. And the other flaw is the extended upper-leg pieces used as his arms and on his back. Not as bad as in later sets, but will still snap if taken apart more than a couple times. Other then that, the parts included in the set are actually quite nice and a good addition to a collection.<br></p><h4>The build</h4>The build isn't the best thing in the world. The body is fun to build of course, and so is the first leg. But after one leg, it becomes kind of tedious to build another because of how bulky and well-structured they are. The arms aren't too much fun either, considering they are Toa-sized. The build is still pretty fun, but involves a lot of thumb suffering from pin pushing.<br>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The actual model is... AMAZING. I love this set. First off, its gigantic, even for a titan. Its not too inflated with big parts, but still uses the same amount as sets like Axonn. The body is really buff, and menacing. They got a good size of his upper-body to lower-body done that makes him appear more masculine and threatening. The spikes on his body appear somewhat awkward, but you get used to them. The downfall of his body is the leg-parts with the daggers on the end. I use it to beef up his back, because without them folded in, his upper body is frail. Plus, what use are they to him? Does he fold them out and shoot, or reach back and grab them or something? Anyways, his legs have got to be the best part. The feet are insanely awesome, with three toes instead of two, due to this complicated structure on his ankles. The lower-legs aren't too great, since they are just piraka parts. At least there is a pullcage to help support his legs. Great addition, really helps him stay stead and keep his legs tense and poseable. The upperleg is where its at. They are longer than just using the normal breaky upperleg part, with Toa Metru feet on the sides. He has spikes on the end, that like to wiggle. He has golden piraka kneepads, on a bar with a 2-stud long golden pipe below it. The bar is connecting to the final part with a throwbot foot. A downside of this design is that sometimes, the throwbot foot may fall out of the hand, or the bar may slide out, on occasion. The problem with the legs is the way that they are connecting with only one ball joint. Maybe if there were pipes, like on the arms, they would be more stable. But if those joints become loose, you're screwed. The arms are nice. They could be better, though. The claws are cool, one with some thumbs on it. The best part of the arms is how they are connected via pipes to the back of Brutaka, helping to support them and make them look cool too. The set itself is actually really, really fun to play with. His legs are easy and fun to pose, and his is pretty easy to balance. The arms are not as mobile, but still can be positioned nicely on the body. He feels so elegant, so buff.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all, this set is one of the best I have ever owned. It is really poseable, has some awesome parts, and is a blast to build and play with. If you can find it for cheap, get it! And also, if you have Axonn you can combine them to make Botar, or with Vezon and Fenrakk as well to make Vezon and Kardas. Truly a great set. Worth the money. If you don't have Brutaka, you aren't a Bionicle fan.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Nmfrey23","2021-12-25T05:07:15.08Z","Amazing Warriors set","<p>Brutaka is a phenomenal titan build. Despite being a functionless figure, the build more than makes up for it. It is very complex, especially regarding the torso and legs. This figure stands much taller than many other sets, and it is only beaten by a few others in terms of height overall. In my opinion, This monstrous figure is well worth your time if you can find a reasonably priced copy.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>.A well armoured and very detailed set in almost all areas</p>

<p>.Color scheme of navy blue and gold works very well</p>

<p>.Great balance and above average posing</p>

<p>.Second hidden set of arms&nbsp;</p>

<p>.Massive weapon</p>

<p>.Copious amounts of gold pieces</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>.When his hidden arms are extended, Brutaka looks far thinner</p>

<p>.The hands stick out from the wrists at an odd angle</p>

<p>.The wide mask can sometimes limit head movement</p>

<p>.The gold tubes can occasionally detach from the shoulder</p>

<p>Without a doubt, Brutaka is a standout set that looks amazing. 5/5</p>
