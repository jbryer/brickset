He may still have that dark grey (bley) color, but the gold just works really well with him, and so it kind of makes up for the absence of a new secondary color. Though I cannot say he is the best piraka, this set is definitely a welcome addition to any bionicle collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Nice feet

A bit more gold might be nice

And the technic parts used to build Reidak is molded in such a way that it looks even more of a steampunk beast. To top it off, the Zamor Sphere launcher brings top marks to this Bionicle. This set is a must-have for all Bionicle fans and steampunk lovers!

Pros
-Black and gold colour scheme is nice.
-Rubber head/spine is interesting.
-Buzz Saw is cool.
-Eyes light up.
-Zamor launcher powerful...

Cons
-...but maybe too powerful.
-Rubber head/spine limits movement.
-Zamor very easily falls out of the launcher.

"vexorian","2010-04-06T19:33:02.247Z","Twisted looking","I saw it on a store today and thought it was probably the easiest way to get a brutaka gold ""Inika"" chest so I bought it.<br><br>Building experience: This gets a 3/5 because the instructions were completely non-obvious in parts like the removal of the lighted eyes from the cap or how to attach the rubber spine to the arms . I am still not sure if I did it correctly. <br><br>Parts: 5 because of piraka gold parts which are always good to have. It even has brutaka's ""hands"" as feet and many pieces that are good for black/gray stuff. It also has the piraka electric eyes, it is like your toa metru eyes piece but has a switch which makes the eyes light. 5/5.<br><br>However, the mask is rubber attached permanently to the spine, greatly reduces the ways you can use it. The canister has a ""mask"" in the cap for demonstrating the light eyes
functionality, something I really disliked is that while this mask can
be removed it does not have the usual attachment points. It would have been great if the plastic mask was a normal Kanohi, really. The other pieces are so more useful&nbsp; than the average canister that I am still giving it a 5 in pieces though.<br>
<br>Playability: Gets a five, the guy looks so beasty and original that is great for posing and the launcher + light eyes should be fun for kids. 5/5<br><br>Value for money: Hmnn it seems fair to me, brutaka gold pieces, the electric eyes and also all the pieces you expect in a Inika build for the typical cost.. 4/5 . Something I did not like is that the light eyes piece has a battery that is 'non-replaceable' I think there might be ways to replace it, but sounds like destroying the piece would be necessary for that, kinda makes the value of this guy more temporary than you'd expect from LEGO.<br><br>Overall: 4/5&nbsp; (not an average) It would have been an awesome set without the flaws I described, specially the non-replaceable battery is something that annoys me too much for me to give it a 5/5 and I am usually generous on it.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
"tkettle9719","2012-01-06T22:21:39.13Z","The least expensive Bionicle ever.","<p>I got this set from Target, when all of the Targets' computers in my city had gone out, and so I got this set for 3 dollars less than regular price, something I wasn't expecting. This set is quite cool, and is my favorite Piraka.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The black, gray, and gold here are each well-represented.<br></li><li>-This guy's mask has a very certain maniacal look to it.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-I sort of wish that the gold color was more represented. <br></li><li>-If it were me, I would have added a little pull-string motor for the saw to spin.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This Piraka set is excellent, and works well in my collection, especially at the price that I got it at. I highly recommend this set, and all other Piraka.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poseability of his head is limited because of his rubber spine, but otherwise he's quite poseable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has glow in the daek teeth and light up eyes.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-04-15T21:28:08.187Z","On the loose","<p>Reidak is quite an interesting Bionicle character. He can list murderer, treasure hunter, and rap star on his resume. But how good is his canister set?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>More than half of the parts included are new. The feet, legs, armour, skull piece, eye piece, rubber spines, forearms, ammo and weapons are all new.</p>

<p>Colors: I always enjoy when Bionicle sets feature an unusual accent colour to go along with one of the six basic colours (red, white, black, green, brown &amp; blue). The black and gold featured in this set looks very good.</p>

<p>Functions: This set has a few different functions. All six Piraka have double-ended weapons that can flip over. Reidak can switch between a huge circular saw and a drill bit. His zamor sphere launcher works very well (holds one shot but comes with four). In addition, his eyes light up with the push of a button, and the skull&#39;s teeth glow in the dark.</p>

<p>Movement: The Piraka were the first canister sets to have three moving joints in each limb.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some may not like the asymmetrical arms.</p>

<p>Spines severely limit head movement and can sometimes limit arm movement.</p>

<p>Zamor spheres can sometimes fall out of the launcher.</p>

<p>Eye battery is annoying to replace (difficult to get the piece open).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reidak is probably my favourite of the Piraka. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the gold weapons or how different the face and spines look from the other Piraka. Either way, I&#39;d definitely recommend this set. 4/5.</p>
