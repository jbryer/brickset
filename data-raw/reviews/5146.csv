"Gus_263","2008-01-16T08:47:25.607Z","Great stuff","Hakann is my second piraka. For me it is great, the colors like scorched armors, the spine makes your face like a thief, and its weapon, the lava launcher are too a claw. If you are searching for red bionicles to make creations, use this set,the laser piece in the weapon can be used as a lightsaber. All piraka features  glow in the dark teeths and light up eyes.

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-18T10:24:12.353Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Piraka) - Hakann Review","<p>This is a nice figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 42 pieces and it was 9 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was about 21 cents per piece which is a little bit high but it's still worth the money.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8901-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. One one hand we can see a cool looking gun and on the other hand we can see a launcher which shoots very well. If you push the head of this figure you can see that the eyes are going to glow. What's also nice about the piraka figures is that the teeth can glow in the dark, too.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"tkettle9719","2012-01-04T08:03:50.243Z","Piraka of Fire!","<p>I got this Piraka for full price at Walmart, and favor this Piraka as my favorite one in my collection, whether it be that this guy has two guns (or long-range weapons), or the fact that red Bionicles are always my favorite, this one is cool. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The gun on his right hand is awesome, a great weapon, and feels even more complete with the red rod in it. <br></li><li>-This Bionicle takes up the newer dark red, which by that time had grown accustomed to red Bionicles everywhere.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The mask looks quite awesome in the front, but the mask in the back deproves the overall functionality of this guy.<br></li><li>-I also don't like the choice of red eyes for all of the Piraka; I understand that this guy is supposedly evil, but he just looks better with green eyes. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is really quite nice, and the mask is great for any collection, though it brings major limitations to the table. Get this set, but be warned about the mask. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
