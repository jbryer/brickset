"legozander","2006-09-02T09:02:17Z","Yahoo","This set is just great. U get a supercool spine a cool harpoon.(But Toa Inika Hahlis harpoon is cooler.) The zamor falls out a bit easily but that is super easy to fix:)I also got an almost completely yellow zamor in the set too and its coool. The light up eyes work very well. The glow in the dark teeth ere cool as well. Oh yes and the light blue on vezok is in fact not new. That colour in fact is the colour of the matoran Matoros mask. And also that ice blue on thok is in fact the same colour as the light blue on Toa Gali! Vezoks clawed feet are quite cool as well. Vezok certainly has a meanacing face like all the other piraka. The buzz saw that can hurl water daggers on the other end of the harpoon looks like a hook if you ask me... So overall vezok is well worth getting if you want him so i hope my reivew helped!",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"lewa_rocks","2007-04-26T16:31:13.45Z","Nice set for a Bionicle fan","I think I would give this set a 9/10 its realy cool I just think its weird that one are is big and the other is small I like the spikes and the light up eyes.If you are like me im a Bionicle fan if you dont like Bionicles then you should buy won to see if there cool and if you still dont like them then dont get any more. This is a good set for 8$ its cool its fun and its quite cheap.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-08T11:57:33.937Z","Classic blue guy","Vezok can like very the other piraka, but he have a cool designed spine. He don't like very beast, but his feets have claw-like fingers. The harpoon have a hook on it's back. It is a very usable piece because is a double sized one. Another stuffs, included with all piraka, glows in the dark teeths and light-up eyes. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-01T10:57:00.123Z","Vezok Can Swim","I got this free and I think that Vezok looks very sharp and mean business. He has very sharp arms and thighs which look like the edges of a chainsaw and his mask/face is quite scary in the dark. However I think that the Zamor Sphere launcher is cool. Maybe this would appeal to the Bionicle fans.

"vezon8764","2008-09-30T18:39:59.03Z","All the same","Vezok is just the same as the other Piraka. I'm not saying that that is bad, but it gets boring to see that Bionicle lost some of the &quot;different&quot; build for some Bionicles.
Pros:
Zamor launcher works well
Comes with 4 Zamor balls
Light up eyes
Glow in the dark teeth
Rubber head
Cons:
No other batteries for eyes
Teeth get dirty and don't glow that well
Zamor balls fall out launcher, but a Bohrok shield on the top fixes that.
Good if you want to finish your Piraka collection, but I would suggest Thok for a first. He actually has a smile on him.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-22T08:42:17.547Z","Got Him On eBay","He's a cool Piraka, but, of course, just like the Toa Inika, they're all clones of each other, except for faces, weapons, and colors.  He still gets a five, though, because he's just so cool.  I like his multi-use weapon and light-up eyes.  So what're the ups and downs to this set?

Pros:

Light up eyes

Weapon

Glow-in-the-dark teeth

Zamor Launcher

Rubber spine

Cons:

Clone of the rest

Zamor sometimes falls out

He's a nice set, so if you're on the lookout for a Piraka, get Vezok or Thok.  See you later!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2010-01-17T12:32:41.483Z","What's so bad about this?!?","Vezok is a GREAT set! The harpoon gun is cool, the Zamor sphere launcher works very well, and the eyes light up very well! Not much else to say, really! So, onto the pros and cons:

Pros

Harpoon gun
Flexible head/tail/arm armour
Great feet
Great launcher

Cons

NONE!

Overall, a great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-18T10:30:54.58Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Piraka) - Vezok Review","<p>This is a nice set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This figure has 41 pieces and it was 9 USD when it was on sale. That means that the price per piece ratio was about 22 cents per piece.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8902-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On one hand we can see a launcher which shoots very well. The other hand is holding a gun. If you push the head of this figure you can see that the eyes will glow and what's also cool about the piraka is that the teeth can glow in the dark.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
