"greg_duncan","2007-07-17T18:04:34.483Z","worth getting!","Zaktan- one of the coolest green flavoured bionicle characters ever made. I mean, until this set came out, we only had Iruni with gold parts. This second gold-green toa is a lot better than his predecessor is. I mean, he has a better shade of gold, a nicer secondary colour (sand green), and two great features. The zamor and the light-up eyes are much better than previous green toa with their rhotukas. Definitely worth buying. Check out my profile!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The weapon, a three bladed cutter, and a claw in the other side is cool, with a gold color like his body. Notable piraka features are the spine, glow in the dark teeth, light-up eyes, and some pieces. The feet, same of avak and thok.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KennyD99","2009-08-28T16:43:48Z","Evil.","I don't know where I got this set but I HATE Piraka. The only things that redeem the set are the zamor sphere shooter and the light-up eyes.

Pros:
Light up eyes
Zamor sphere shooter  

Cons:
None (for Piraka fans)


I would recommend this for Piraka fans.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The mask on this guy is very evil-looking, and is well done.<br></li><li>-The mixture of green and gold on this guy is awesome.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The other green may look cool, but it is a weird pale color.<br></li><li>-I also would like a bit more of the gold color on this set. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is excellent, and works quite well in any collection. Luckily, Bionicle sets in each series get varied from this point on, so you can buy many Piraka, a nice recommendation. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Capricorn","2012-12-23T21:03:38.71Z","Zaktan, Leader of the Piraka!","<p>Piraka Zaktan is one of the six Bionicle Piraka of 2006. Like all other Piraka, he is a figure full of features and accessories. The Piraka line was quite a game-changer for Bionicle, as they all had their own personalities and traits, like Toa, and weren't just clones of each other and army-builders like the Bohrok, Vahki, Visorak... etc. Not even to mention how fun they are to play with as well.<br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has enough parts to build Zaktan, and... thats about it. There's not many matching parts that you could use on an everyday creation. Of course, the body, hips, arm and leg parts can be used in a variety of ways, even though the upper-leg bits can break on you. However, the skull and head only really fit with Piraka. The chest and launcher and weapon are an ugly original gold that doesn't appear anywhere else (other than Brutaka, I beleive) so they cannot exactly be used well. Despite the poor color, however, the Zamor launcher is an incredible device. When you place one of the antidermis spheres in the launcher and press the back, it launches out with quite a force and can fly a few feet. Unlike 2005's spinners, the Zamor Launcher can be aimed and always fires correctly, unlike disk or cordak blasters. However, a MAJOR downfall of the device is that there is nothing to hold the bullets in place, and its not easy to build one on top either. As a result, it is EXTREMELY easy to lose Zamor spheres, not to mention their rolling-ness. However, other than that on his other arm there is a beastly three-bladed weapon. Like the other Piraka, his weapon can be flipped to reveal a claw (which unfortunately cannot close or move at all.) A downside of this great-looking birdlike weapon is that the ends are rather easy to bend, and will stay bent if they are. The figure also has a glow-in-the-dark skull (a rather useless addition... I mean, who has glowing teeth!?) and glowing eyes when you press the top of his head. The glowing eyes signify the Piraka's ability to use heat vision. However, the eyepeice for the Piraka cannot easily be pressed outside a Piraka head, and after 6 years it begins to die. It is not easy to replace the batteries inside. On the skull is Zaktan's original spine-y head. His mouth curves over the teeth in a V shape, that looks quite nice and fits his personality. He has tiny spikes above his eyes that also fit him, and he has spines going all the way down his back and forming into a tail. The spines are like an extended version of Reidak's. Like the rest of his team his spines also extend to serve as arm armor (lol). A downside of this is that the arm armor (lol) will pop off during play, and can be challenging to place back on.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build for Zaktan is rather quick, like all canister sets. First you begin with constructing the body, which is really just connecting three parts together. Next you build the legs, which is also pretty basic and easy. Next the arms are build, and the Zamor Launcher. It is built out of several technic parts to make a retracting pusher push the sphere out the tense launcer-body part. Next, the head is built. The head feels very awkward to build, and it can be a challenge to fit the skull with the eyes into the rubbery flexible model. Overall, the build is short and simple, with occasional hard or boring parts, and is definately not to love the set over.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Something you CAN love the set over is the finished figure. The figure is just excellent! The whole thing can be placed into a variety of poses and is quite good at balancing itself. The launcer of course can be fired, and the result is satisfactory. The figure is also quite tall, and the flipping weapon is a great addition. The eyes also are able to light up and look quite nice inside his rubber head. The armor bits, such as the knee armor, spines, arm armor (lol) and weapon all fit Zaktan well. This figure is quite a sight to behold, and is very fun to pit against a Toa Inika.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4>In the end, despite the poor parts and build this figure is quite incredible. It had many great features, weapons and armor and is ready to take on any Toa! The color and armor fits the figure very nicely and the launcher is very effective. Zaktan is probably one of the better Piraka (even though they are all great [except Avak, Mr. Chubbycheeks...]) and can be a fantastic addition to any Bionicle collector, even at an above-average price. <br>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
