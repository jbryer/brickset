"legozander","2007-01-25T05:20:40Z","Last brown bad guy.","I picked up Avak along with Toa Jaller a few days ago and loved him as soon as he was built! Avak features metallic grey armour and weapons, cool webbed like feet ans awesome spine too! I will now list my likes and dislikes. Likes: Feet, spine, head, weapons and armour. Dislikes: Zamor sphere falls out too easily (I fixed it though.) and the head can hardly move. However Avaks overall coolness makes up for these problems and therefor Avak gets an exellent 5/5! But it makes me sad to think he is the last ever brown bad guy. :(

"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-13T14:13:50.903Z","Good intent,bad make","As i am new to brickset i'll do what most people do and do a pros and cons review.

Cons

spine thing limits posibility

"Gus_263","2008-02-11T11:53:30.437Z","The last brown","My last brown set. This set color, is very good for stone sets. The pickaxe is on the other side another weapon. Double sided weapons, glow in the dark teeth, light-up eyes, spine combined with a mask and body. The feet are great, in size or no.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T16:58:24.967Z","Cool Piraka","This is a cool Piraka!  Like others have said: This is the last one with the color brown.:(  I wish they made more brown Bionicles!  Anyway, this is just a Clone of the others but different colors and some pieces!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-10T18:57:14.03Z","MY SECOND FAVOURITE PIRAKA!","This guy is almost as awesome as Zaktan. The Brown goes really well with the dark irony colour. His weapon is really cool and the feet are awesome! The Zamor sphere launcher shoots consistently and is a really good projectile weapon. Still not as cool as Zaktan but worth the money and a great build. KEEP IT UP LEGO!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ta_koro_matoran","2008-11-08T02:37:29.03Z","good set","this is reallt good set it's awesome and i really like the pixax (wich i like to use as a shotgun :)) like all the other piraka it doesn't have that much posabillaty but otherwise a really good set i would suggest it to anyone that wants a bionicle with a shotgun :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-20T11:22:56.817Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Piraka) - Avak Review","<p>This is a good looking figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This figure has 41 pieces and was 9 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 22 cents per piece. I think it's a 
really good value for what we get here.<br><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8904-1.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>I remember this figure has been my very first piraka I've got. The

 arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be adjusted. On 
one hand we can see a launcher which shoots very well and on the other hand has a nice looking gun. What's also cool about the piraka figures is 
that 
the </span><span>teeth can glow in the dark. A</span><span>nother cool thing we get here is that the eyes of this figure will glow when you push Avak's head</span><span>.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"james3426","2009-10-29T21:48:45.06Z","The inventive Piraka","This is my only Piraka that I have. (My brother has the other three on my collection) He is also my only pure brown Bionicle, with a lighter brown color as his secondary color. I notice some Bionicle sets have have three colors and Avak is no exception. His upper torso, seismic pickaxe, and zamor launcher are dark metallic gray. Some people think think that the fact that one shorter arm is a problem, but it does not bother me. His feet are one of my favorite types with two long toes. On the downside, his head is hard to move due to the way it is attached to his torso and how the spine parts on his arms go to the main part of it, and that goes up to his head, resulting in his head and arms having limited pose-ability. This is my first normal set review without pros and cons, because I do not have time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
