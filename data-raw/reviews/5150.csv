This set is awesome as! My third favourite Piraka. I really was not pleased with Reidak, so Wwhen I saw my bro had gotten Thok the awesome I thought no fair!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-11T11:59:37.14Z","The frozen piraka","The white piraka have a double sided weapon including two pieces. The spine, one of the most simple, is one of the better. The light-up eyes, glow in the dark teeth, and some pieces same of other piraka are great to creations. The combination with vezok is great. The colors looks like a guy of ice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-23T22:03:54.78Z","Best Piraka Out There","Thok was my second Piraka, and is my favorite of the two I own (Vezok is the other one; I used to have Reidak).  See my review for Vezok; my message is still the same.  They're only clones of each other.  I wish Lego had made them a little more unique, like the Barraki and Toa Mahri.  Still, Thok is a good set.  I like his weapon with the blue thingy inserted inside.  It makes it look like a real freeze gun or something.  His eyes and teeth are also a good feature, as well as the first Zamor Sphere Launcher.  So let me get my ideas organized:

Pros:

Ice gun looks wicked

Zamor launcher

Teeth and Eyes

Grinning face (kinda goofy and emphasized)

Cons:

Rubber spine makes him hard to pose

Clone of the other Piraka

This is what I think of Thok.  He's a good set; worth keeping anyway.  BionicleBOOM signin' out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This figure has 42 pieces and was 9 USD when it was on 
sale. The price per piece ratio was 21 cents per piece. I think it's a 
really good value for a figure like this.<br><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers as well.<br></p>

 arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On 
one hand we can see a gun and on the other hand we can see a launcher which shoots very well. What's also cool about the piraka figures is that 
the </span><span>eyes can glow if you push the head. A</span><span>nother cool thing we get here is that 
the </span><span></span><span>teeth glow in the dark.</span><span> I really can't complain about 
this figure.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Johnsmith1235","2012-05-05T15:29:34.787Z","Thok definitely gives the impression of an ice BIONICLE. And his Ice gun is soooooooooo coooool!","<p>Thok's spines are the biggest (longest?) of the Piraka. He has A cool evil grin, and his dual action weapon is huge! Like the rest of the Piraka he also has light up eyes and A Zamor sphere launcher.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Big spines. 
<li>Nice build, easy and looks great! 
<li>Has A nice height of almost 8""! 
<li>Nice weapons. 
<li>Evil grin. (For A Piraka that's A good thing by the way). 
<li>Glow in the dark teeth</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cross piece in the head looks A little weird with the off white. 
<li>Socket pieces on the feet sometimes slip off the cross pins. 
<li>Poseability is limited on the head and arms because of the rubber spines.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All said and done Thok is pretty impressive, and playability is no issue. And whatever some people say, all the Piraka spines and heads are different. </p>
<p>This set is definitely worth it, and can be found easily on Bionicle Piraka Ebay. (Maybe on Amazon too, I don't know).</p>
