"surfersofthemind","2006-07-21T20:38:57Z","Someone call the Ambulance!","This is a great set. Full of detail, heaps of peices and picked it up for less than AU$11.00.
Features an old school building style with many new parts. The 4 wide cars, 6 wide vans and 8 wide trucks add a real life scale to the Lego city. 
For those that have to have doors, raise the van body 1 plate higher (above the wheel arch) and add your doors! Too easy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2007-02-12T13:18:35.4Z","Great addition to my Lego Fire and Rescue Department...","Personally, I'm loving the new look on this ambulance, and the vehicle fits in nicely with the new 2007 fire trucks.  My only complaint is that if Lego were going to make the vehicle as big as it is, they should have added another minifig to the kit. Either a second EMT or patient, would do. There's good attention to detail and the stretcher with health monitor is a nice touch. Considering the price, I think it's a great bargain.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brickzone","2007-03-21T19:55:12.463Z","Neat","This set was the instigator of my return to Lego. It has modern pieces, yet is a decent proper construction that looks like a Lego ambulance should. Great value at the price too. I don't entirely like the guy with it (what silly stupid sunglasses), but he's ok as just a driver and I use proper lego men from my ebay/old stock. You can fit a doctor sitting in (just) between the stretcher and doors.

The missing doors are a pity, but Lego has always had a problem with vehicle side doors; the usual ones still require holes in the side of your vehicle. I'd like to see this fixed properly, rather than rejig sets like this to allow those 1x3 doors. The 1x3 doors would look very silly on a bigger model like this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T01:36:28.53Z","Keep it Simple - Get the Ambulance Now !!!!","This set was only 7.00 US dollars a steal. Great detail and every town needs to have ambulance. Like the 6 stud width and the stretcher and accesories. Buy this one or you will one day wish you had it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yeow","2008-01-07T00:06:16.64Z","Good Bye Dark Ages","As with brickzone, this set is also why I am not in the Dark Ages anymore. At a price of $7.00US, it's a steal. Many new pieces, and modern enough for a Lego town. The lack of doors does not bother me at all, unlike the removeable roof. The roof was an extremely easy fix however, simply by replacing the smooth piece with a studed one. Overall, an extremely nice set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bricklord","2008-02-22T20:43:21.56Z","Good to have a new ambulance but this isn't a great set","I like vehicles and this is not a bad vehicle.<br><br>Pros:<br>- paramedic mini-fig w/ stretcher (I like the bottle attachment)<br>- good basic design (chassis is rock solid)<br>- large opening back door<br><br>Cons:<br>- stickers, especially ones that cover more than one piece (the window stickers! argh!)<br>- the roof is tricky (4 piece construction, 2 sections are designed to be easily removable)<br><br>For a City vehicle, it's decent.  I'm just not ecstatic about it.",TRUE,3,3,2,4,3
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-11-02T01:59:21.233Z","911!","This is my second rescue set, and it's quite big. Let's see how it deals.
Box : 4/5
What can I say?

Building : 5/5
Nice, building scheme is well and instructions are clear enough

Playbility : 5/5
Extremely well. This is great to play, you can be a doctor, a driver, a patient, you name it. 

Overall : 5/5
This set is nice, with sweet windows and large space on the back, plus the back door can swing open. The cons is that the bumper is weakly attached to the body of the car.

Pros:
Doctor
Big size
Windows
Back door can be opened
A lot of 'light' parts

Cons : 
Stickers

Side Notes:
In the Brickset's pic, the doctor's face is just a simple smiling face. In mine, he is wearing a pair of spectacles
The notes on Brickset.com says that the side compartment can be opened. In mine, there's no side compartment.

Felix",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Egorredcloak","2008-04-26T18:18:28.483Z","Excellent versatile set","The ambulance is well made and perfect for a hospital scene. It is also very easy to convert into a jeep (pushing the window back and using the front part of the roof as the hood. Mines now serving as a support vehicle for my Homo Sapiens Empire troopers (developed for my wargame, out some time far from now by the rate I am writing it)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Noah1997","2008-05-09T07:37:57.873Z","pretty good","this set was pretty good for just a small set i like the stretcher you 
can put lego guys in the stretcher and open the back doors and put then in side ore you can put the driver in and ride.I got this set for
 9 bucks at toys are us i started building it in the car pretty funny
well anyway awesome set one of my faves.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-08T22:50:17.857Z","Great","I got this set somewhere in Feb 2006. Right when I saw what it looked like on the box, I became eager to build it. The ambulance is quite sleek. It comes with a doctor, stretcher, moniter, medicine injector and a briefcase. The only problems were that it didn't include a patient, and the briefcase keeps moving around when the ambulance is moving. Overall great set and resonable price, with each piece costing eight cents. ",FALSE,5,5,5,3,4
"Buckbrick","2008-07-29T10:08:47.06Z","Perfect delivery truck for my green grocer","This little ambulance is perfectly sized, as compared to the larger trucks like the Prisoner Transport. I got this set mainly because I wanted to modify it to a  delivery truck to compliment the Green Grocer. Eventually, I managed to come up with a delivery van that resembles the Vestas truck from the windmill set! Add a crate of fruit and you're good to go!

And of course, the ambulance looks great.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jakelongdragon","2008-08-03T11:20:06.793Z","One of my favorite City sets","This is one of my favorite City sets. The ambulance looks exactly like a regular ambulance. It is sturdy and big enough to fit 2 or 3 minifigs. The windows are nice even without the stickers. This set is not for collection. This is for playing! For the price ($8.00 for 118 pieces) it is a great deal.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BrickPiet44","2008-11-19T08:44:48.483Z","Recommend with good looks, with some extra's would have been excellent","This ambulance is a good city set. The ambulance has a good colour scheme. The front is quite neat. The back doors are a return to the late 1960s set and therefore a plus. They work good and fit perfect in this car. The roofs can be easily taken off, for a view inside. The size is good, it's bigger than regular cars and smaller than the trucks.
Still, some downsides: no injured passenger or an extra nurse. Little detail inside.
Overall:

Plus:
- right size
- right colours
- good looks (front)
- working back doors
- removalble roofs 
- great playability

Minus:
- little detail inside
- no second minifig

Overall: 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pod120","2009-02-01T04:46:00.78Z","Tend To The Invisible Patient","This was my first Lego City set and one of my favourite smaller sets. I got this the same day as the Fire Truck in July 2006 as a holiday gift from my Mum. About the set, I think the blue windows, Emergency Emblem and lights create it's sleek look, especially under good lighting.

Pros
-A good combination of colours on the vehicle
-Includes Stretcher, Oxygen Tank and Heart Rate Monitor
-Stretcher slides into the back well

Cons
-Set has stickers
-Suit case has no specified storage location inside vehicle
-Every time set is advertised or displayed something is incorrect (pieces in wrong place or minifig has wrong head)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
