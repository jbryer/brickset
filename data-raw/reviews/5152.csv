I got this set for Christmas from my brother and it really completes my airport. My only complaint is the price. Come on! $14.99 is way over-priced for what you get.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-12T06:15:08.763Z","OK but something else is much better","My rating for this set is 3 because it isn't that bad. However, since it is a recent set, it has these new parts which makes the vehicle look big. My honest recommendation to anyone who might consider buying this set and is reading reviews is to take the time and look at an older Lego set: the #6614. Now even though this set is for Space Launch, you can simple apply this set for your Airport or whatever it may be. Addition to detail, opening doors, well-equipped and it looks more sophisticated.

"mrmitch","2007-06-12T01:30:53.607Z","Cleaver design - Good looking truck ! ! ! ! ","This set is impressive, its part of the new City theme thats been out for the past two years or so. I like the color of the truck, like that its 6 wide also like the mini figure. My planes feel secure knowing that this truck sits near the runway. This is a must have for the uniquieness of it and the price is reasonable. Get it while you can !!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-19T15:08:43.873Z","awesome","this is a great firetruck with tons of accesories. personaly i got mine on sale one boxing day. it actualy looks like real airport fire trucks for a couple of reasons.

1. the front slopes up which give it a realalistic feel.
2. the pump extends upwards and rotates
3.its wide!

great set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legobear","2007-10-24T00:47:44.467Z","I had to mod it to love it.  ","I bought this set because I thought it'd be cool to have an airport fire truck since I wanted to build an airport.

Bad Points:  
Uses Stickers. 
No doors.
No Seat.
6 wide car, bigger than it looks.
Expensive for such a thing.
Bright Yellow Red.  Same color as postal cargo and postal car (2008).
The fireman won't fit in the car with his helmet on.
Sig Fig with glasses again.


Good Points:
Modible!!  
Good update to the older version.
Unique and specialized for its purpose.

You can easily take out 2 studs in the mid section to make the car shorter and it still looks nice. I heavily modded this thing, it took about a month.  Now I absolutely love it. If you're really into airports, buy it.  If you're just into expanding your town, there are other wonderful sets. Use the 1 month rule, when you really want it, wait 1 month before you purchase it, this ensures you won't regret it. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sikennedy","2008-05-21T18:56:34.937Z","top truck","Its a great set and one of the best trucks available at the moment and i thought good value for money. Its got loads of great detail and the 6 wide size just seems to work really well in this set for an airport. as usual ggggrrrrhhh stickers! but other than that its top dog!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-15T18:27:43.153Z","Nothing Special","There is nothing special about this set, in fact, it is worse than previous fire trucks. This should be like other fire trucks i.e. with an extendable boom and hose. However, there is only an extendable nozzle that can only extend a short length. Set includes fire extinguisher, phone, helmet, visor, oxygen tank, axe, nozzle and minifigure. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the pieces are useful.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kipper147","2019-06-10T02:55:03.817Z","Fun little truck!","<p>Back in the mid-2000s, my parents would go grocery shopping and bring home smaller lego sets like this;&nbsp;usually city vehicles.&nbsp; When opening this set, it becomes clear that this set is&nbsp;the&nbsp;epitome of mid-2000s&nbsp;city theme.&nbsp; Bulky design, newer mud guards and license&nbsp;plate/head light brackets, those dreadful&nbsp;stickers.</p>

<p>The build is pretty simple, but it has a nice boxy-thickness to it, that for a child, makes it really fun and easy to drive around, and there is a fair bit of storage inside; if not being taken up by the fire hose.&nbsp; The fire hose mechanism, while incredibly simplistic, is marvelous, in my opinion, for its simplicity.&nbsp; It folds up with relative ease, and then right back down to where it was.<br />
<br />
All in all, I think this is a fantastic little set.&nbsp; If you, or your kid, has a town or an airport that needs a fire truck, this is absolutely the one that I would recommend!</p>

"claherre","2008-12-27T20:29:09.327Z","A modern look...","Another set that I thinks addresses a need in every town with an airport. The truck has a futuristic design, with the ingenious hose.

Like most of these wide scale cars, they look out of place with the older vehicles, but I think they fit better the minifig scale.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"chewron99","2021-03-02T07:17:37.273Z","Nice little set","<p>Overall: nice little set, 4,5&nbsp; / 5 points</p>

<p>Blocks: very useful parts, easy-to-replace, bright colour, just like the real-life truck</p>

<p>A great part of a LEGO town or an airport</p>

<p>Cons: no variety, only one vehicle cn be built (a flaming turbine is missing) should there +1 minifig</p>
