"Cashcleaner","2007-02-16T02:24:07.89Z","Not worth buying at full price","We picked up this kit just today for something to build and to go along with my new City Fire Department units.  At the regular price of $79.99 (CAN) it's not worth the box it comes in, but we picked it up on sale for $49.99 (CAN), which is more reasonable for what you get.

First off, the main building itself is far too small to serve as any real medical centre.  The operating room, recovery room, and first level entrance rooms are far too small to be of any use.  Also, the fact that the building is perched percariously on a steep baseplate is somewhat mind-boggling.  You'll note that for a hospital, there is absolutely NO wheelchair access, completely laughable, in my opinion.  In addition to all this, you've got a small rescue truck instead of a proper ambulance, and the helicopter isn't much better either.

All things said, we did pick this kit up at a greatly reduced price and if you consider the building more like an emergency trauma centre (as TheMysticWood mentioned) and not as a stereotypical hospital, it's not that bad a deal.  I would never consider it a bargain at the full price, but if you can catch it on sale, it's really not that bad a kit.  There are some nice pieces like surgical saws and other operating tools that give the kit some nice detail.  Also, you get 4 minifigs (2 EMTs, 1 Doctor, and 1 patient) which is more than I was expecting at first.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The base plate is flimsy and is just cheap plastic. THe entire frame of this so called ""building"" is entirely unstable. I can literally tap the building and it will just fall over and collapse on itself. Where's the ambulance? The only remotely good thing about this set is the operation room. On the second floor there are only two beds. Pretty cheap. And why don't the patients have the proper medical sick clothes?

"japkleine","2009-01-18T02:15:13.373Z","Great set! Some minor flaws!","I picked this set up on sale and I am really surprised about the details it contains. Of course, like other reviewers said, there are some minor details that could have been better thought through by LEGO, but on the whole it has great playability. My son loves this set already and spends hours to play with it. He likes especially the car and the helicopter. He plays with the minifigs (there are four of them, which I think is great) and it is all in all a very nice set. I really like it and for kids it is great to play with.
There are only relatively bad rewiews for this set here. I think that is sad, since you have to remember for which age group this set was designed. The kids do not think of thinks like a wheelchair ramp for example or other things that are missing. They just love it, because you can play with it and there is a certain authenticity about the set.
So, 4 out of five, since there are some details and some flaws, that could have been easily avoided, but on the whole, I would recommend to buy it (maybe, when you can find it on sale).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2010-05-10T14:13:36.06Z","A step up from Town Jr but still too over-simplified","<p>Lego hospitals are few and far between, so I was interested when I heard about this set.&nbsp; Unfortunately I can't say I'm very impressed.&nbsp; Whilst it's a vast improvement after the dark days of Town Jr, it still has real flaws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a start, it looks more like an air/sea rescue base than a hospital.&nbsp; The car and the helicopter are okay, but an ambulance would have been much more fitting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the building is on top of one of those raised baseplates mean patients (including seriously injured ones presumably) can only reach it via a very steep slope or a flight of stairs.&nbsp; This just makes the whole thing feel like it's had very little thought put into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the interior of the building, there's a reception and a couple of beds which are good.&nbsp; But the operating theatre looks more like the kind of toolshed you'd expect to find in the Leatherface family home.&nbsp; Why not go the whole hog and have an attic with Grandpappy sitting in his armchair?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Matt_the_Cat","2009-01-24T00:49:38.357Z","A nicer set than many give Lego credit for...","I was very fortunate to have been given this City set for Christmas just gone (2008) and, though I think it would be much better trauma centre or ER than a hospital, it makes a fine addition to your City collection, and looks great on its own.  I tend to think the designers had a mountainous location when they introduced 7892 onto the market.  

Construction is actually pretty complex with many small pieces creating quite a large and intricate set.  I think the helipad and garage and accompanying ramp are ingenious.  The vehicles are well designed, though not adequate for a hospital (thus the set's designation perhaps as a trauma centre or ER) and the building itself is satisfying with its three-story design and impressive array of intimidating torture implements.  Oops, pardon me, I have been reliably informed they are surgical tools!  

The usual gripes apply, and that is, sigh, as always, those evil stickers.  Some were easy to apply, others were really frustrating.  I am still scratching my head as for the necessity of the grass stickers on the base plate.  

That aside, it's a good, solid set and if you can still find one somewhere, it will be  well worth the trouble.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pod120","2009-06-08T05:04:37.763Z","The lazy Patient needs two Rescue Vehicles!?","This was one of the Lego City Sets in the large group that my brother and I got for Christmas in 2006. I think it's clever how Lego have used the colours in this set, especially the translucent blue, and how the set includes almost everything a real hospital would have, only on a smaller scale. The Plants add greatly to the appearance of the set, and I guess the stickers do aswell.

Pros
-Includes two vehicles- a road vehicle and an air vehicle
-Set includes good range of minifigs
-7890 Ambulance and 7902 Doctors Car both fit in Carport
-Good use of Plants
-Good use of the Base
-Includes a good variety of Medical Equipment including the Stretcher
-A neat design overall

Cons
-A good design, but many people complain about the structure of the Center Tower and that it easily falls apart. I think it doesn't connect well to the Base
-Set has Stickers
-Helicopter is a little Basic-looking
-Another Door could have been included on the ground level, behind the Reception desk to enter the Carport, instead of having to leave the building and walk all the way around and up the Ramp, but it's not really necessary

"HQuiff","2009-06-25T08:44:52.653Z","Not What I Hoped For, But Not Bad...","I don't know why a few of the reviewers are going on about how bad this set is, it's not that bad!
I got it on holiday in Durham, England at Toys R' Us for Â£30.00, which isn't that and consider the playability.
Lets move onto the Basics like how the build was, ETC.

Build - 7/10. Quite enjoyable, though no special elements here, only basic large bricks is all.

Price - That has yet to be determined. Though the set it's self is worth the cost, the brick to price ratio is quite low, consider you only get 380 Bricks + !

Playability - 9/10. Not bad. There's quite a lot of nice games, like rushing the patient into surgery because the lazy Coast Guard forgot to save him for draining. ;)

Minifigs - 7/10. Nothing great, the usual doctor, patient, and nurses. However it's LEGO City here, we never get great civilians. :(

Overall - 7/10. That about rounds it off, a good, though not perfect City set, which isn't essential  to have, though it's also handy if you do have it. The main problem is that the nurses are both Male Minifigs, when will we see more Female minifigs?!

"toofpikk","2010-01-09T13:10:15.827Z","emergency services","the 4/5 is probably just me, because i dont like sets with big holes in them or a open back. i got this in the year 2006 for christmas from my god father, along with the doctors car and the ambulance and the helicoptor to do with hospital emergencies. now on to the set

mini figures: there are four minifigures, these are a patient, a doctor, a helicoptor pilot and the emergency car driver.

props and bits and bobs: a stretcher, a desk, 2 patient beds, a lamp, 4 tools to help the patient.

buildings:the main building for the patients and the operation room aswell as the reception, a helipad with a sort of bridge leading towards it and a shelter for the emergency car

Problems:the helipad isnt very stable and the main building has so few bricks sometimes it collapses, aswell as that the red bits with the windows and doors on them arent put together properly so i have to use my spare bricks to keep it steardy. the stairs arent made to touch both floors of the different levels of the base mat so the stares are very wobbly. this just be my set because i love it and ive been playing with it basically every day. if you hve a child who likes lego, go to ebay and check out what theyre selling.

"ALSTDA","2010-07-06T14:34:43.9Z","""Great for the target age group."" - a re-review","<p>I first wrote this review back in 2010 (6th July), and it hasn&#39;t aged very well! Here is what I originally wrote...</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spent GBP35 on this set and at first I was pleased with it. However it is small in comparison to the police stations of its time which is unrealistic and it looks odd in a city. Luckily I managed to use the walls and windows in other buildings and use the ramps as railway crossings. The helicopter can be used for other purposes but the little car is pretty much useless and mine is not in use. The base-plate makes a good base for a construction yard but otherwise money was wasted here.</p>

<p>It does have good playability though as the vehicles are easily parked and the rooms can be accessed in the usual open back way. It is a fairly good set for young children, not collectors and MODers, but personally at that age a fire station is that great amount better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say&nbsp;I appreciate this set a bit more now than back then...&nbsp;While I admit I haven&#39;t had this built up in a long time, I can agree that this was an alright&nbsp;set for adults too at &pound;35. Who doesn&#39;t love a raised baseplate? And I now see that all parts are useful in their own way.&nbsp;(Why I insisted on leaving so many sets built as the instructions suggested back then I don&#39;t know.) Also, the helicopter is still pretty cool and the colour scheme works well,&nbsp;although a couple more civilians would have improved this set greatly &mdash; even for an extra &pound;5. Goes well with #7890.&nbsp;</p>

While I was building it I got disappointed by unrealistic proportions. I wouldn't agree with the people who said it was garbage because it's a one-of-a-kind set.

"ViceMan","2011-09-19T17:21:07.017Z","A little strange if you ask me.","While I don't own this set, I can clearly tell from the image it's quite odd. It just looks too small and cluttered and yet somehow empty and devoid of character at the same time. The raised baseplate is a bad start, IMO a simple flat baseplate would have been entirely sufficient and allowed a much more natural and open-feeling hospital layout. The building itself looks too small and awkward sitting atop that hill, the choice of vehicles for this set is also questionable, I know there is a separate ambulance set but i'd expect another to come with this one.<br><br>&nbsp;I just can't put my finger on it, but to me this doesn't <span style=""font-style: italic;"">feel</span> like a Lego set. It feels like one of those cheap Lego knock-off sets that when your parents bought them for you, even though they looked like Lego and worked with it too there was a little part of you that felt unclean and dirty. *shudders*<br><br>On a further note, the hospital theme is in desperate need of resuscitation (pun obviously intended.) Lego can do so much better than this, and I would look forward to a revision and improvement of this set. Although I think starting from scratch would be beneficial to any future hospital sets they intend to release: Flat base, large building with reception, waiting area, central corridor, maybe a small ward and operating theatre all on one level, a few doctor's offices above it and a helipad on top. That - I believe - would be a winning formula. <br><br>My summary; it's a rare set, but it's rare for a reason - because it's not worth the money.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><h1 style=""font-weight: normal;"" id=""firstHeading"" class=""firstHeading""><br></h1>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,2
"MusiMus","2020-06-20T18:48:50.253Z","Best Hospital and One of Classic Old City Sets","<p><strong>Overall Rating:</strong></p>

<p>I decided to write this review, because I think, this set is underrated. OK, it isn&#39;t as good as 7744 and 7237 Police Stations (or 7905 Building Crane, 7898 Cargo&nbsp;Train&nbsp;Deluxe&nbsp;and&nbsp;7894&nbsp;Airport,&nbsp;which are from the same year), but I think it&#39;s still very good set. If I had to choose between buying&nbsp;any present City set at the same price, or buying this set second time, I would buy this set. I think, in the City sets from 2005-2008 (2009?) there is something special for me. Maybe it&#39;s also matter of nostalgia, but&nbsp;I don&#39;t care&nbsp;about present&nbsp;City sets at all, but when it comes to old ones, I could build them every single day.</p>

<p><strong>Interior:</strong></p>

<p>Buildings without back wall were and are common in City and&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t bother me at all. If I had to point out any defect, probably it would be a small amount of interior. I think the hospital should be bigger but&nbsp;knowing the style of old City sets and having parts, you can add some modules, parking and landing pad for the Rescue Helicopter (7903).</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>I think there is sort if useful parts (e.g trees, bushes or big&nbsp;baseplate)</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>I wrote something about playability in &#39;interior&#39; section. The set is good for fun and stop-motion animations, but you can creatively improve it by expanding it.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>The design is typical of old city sets. It isn&#39;t complicated and it&#39;s pleasant experience.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money:</strong></p>

<p>For me the set was certainly worth all $49.99... and it&#39;s worth $100+ now. I know, there was a lot of City sets in better price but I would certainly recommend this set.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>Set is good for both for AFOLs, TFOLs, KFOLs and any stop-motion animators.</p>
