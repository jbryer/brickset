"footballfever70","2005-12-15T15:55:01Z","HUGE","It is spectacular where LEGO is going in terms of size.  They are making 6-wide trucks and now this 8-wide airplane.  The entire time I was building it I was amazed at how big it is.  The small tail wings on this one were used as the main wings on older planes.  Inside is a large cockpit that fits a pilot and copilot side by side, first-class seating with 5 seats (three that rotate), a coach section with 6 seats, and an area in the back with a flight attendant seat with a beverage cart.

The only bad thing about this set is that there are many large pieces such as the tail and the wings (both wings are part of the same enormous piece)  But other than that I love it.  It is gigantic, and the door mechanisms are clever.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"st_pete305","2006-08-21T00:09:02Z","Good Set, Correct Scale","This set is a great improvement to the scale of the airplanes from the past. The only issue I have with this set is the landing gear; either the wheels fall off or the whole landing gear assembly folds up during contact with the run-way. 

Overall, this set is worth its value in size, playability, and number of pieces. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-12T06:08:25.59Z","Quite excellent however lacks a few details","I have always wanted a replica plane from Boeing or Airbus as Lego and this set is a great release by Lego. The detail and scale of the plane gives it its best features. You are able to build the cockpit and the fuselage sections of the aircraft, adding the windows, yellow swivel chairs. In addition, at the rear is a drink trolley. There is depth of detail where there are four large engines, the wheels and best of all, the opening and closing of the two doors, giving the plane overall some realistic aspects.

The major design fault of the set is that it comes in very large pieces. And this is because for Lego to produce a plane of its scale, they use large pieces so that building time plus costs would be lowered. I would have much liked if it came in small parts to add extra finer detail to the wings, front and wing stabilizers but I can see Lego's viewpoint. Moreover, you need to be a bit careful with the doors as if you try to re-adjust the handles, it might break. 

All in all, it is an excellent set - it does very much look like the Airbus A340 and the added painted bird symbol gives it some uniqueness.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"dr01d3k4","2006-12-31T05:08:48Z","HUMANGUS!","Pros:
Big
two doors
Eleven passeneger seats
Tv for the first class seats
Goes great whith the 7894 airport as this could be an international plane and the plane from the airport can be domestic.
Trolloy, whith cups
Cons:
needs more passengers
Neads a co-pilot
neads a steward/ stewardess.
the trolloy falls over whilst the plane is Moving
The landing gear ometimes collapses

It is fun to build and to play with. I will most likely get the Airport that came out the same year but that is a Santa gift(wife goes crazy when I get sets over $50).

"sabpol","2007-12-14T22:15:26.467Z","It's Grown on Me","When I went to TRU a few months ago to take advantage of their buy 2 get 1 free sale, I already had my mind set on the Heavy Hauler 7998 and on the Service Station 7993, but I couldn't decide which set to get for the 3rd one.  I have never been a big fan of the LEGO &quot;airplane.&quot;  But this was one of the few sets there in the $40 range, so I reluctantly took it off the shelf and brought it home with my other 2 sets.  

The build is nothing much, but the finished product is beautiful.  I've had this plane displayed throughout my home for months now.  It is one the most humorous LEGO sets I have in that I can hardly look at this big plane without smiling.  This set has really grown on me.

All I would have added to it is some more lights.  How many planes have only 3 tiny lights on the entire plane?  But all in all, it's a set well done, with its 4 minifigs, minifig accessories like suitcases and drinking goblets, little sink, and beverage cart with a little hide-out to store said cart.  I have no regrets with this one.

"elvaro","2007-08-09T11:50:11.597Z","fantastic","I love this PLANE! I think is really really cool. You have the tv and rotatable seats for the first class and normal seats for the second class. There's a trolley, a very detailed cockpit and THE BASIN WITH THE TAP! 

But there were a no. of cons. Lego could have provide a pretty air stewardess miniig instead of the old man. The height of the plane is a little short. They could have make it higher a bit so that people can actually walk from one cabin to another because right now, the ceiling/groin of the plane is actually blocking the minifigs to walk from the cabin to another. 

Overall again, I think this set is really nice. Although it is big, I feel that is actually ok because it is a plane! You can't expect to be small though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
FOUR MINIFIGS WITH RARE PARTS!!
You can put your OTHER minifigs in it! (because it has WAY more then just 4 seats! :D)
It has wheels at the bottom that roll it!
roof comes off so you can see inside! 
Cool     pit!

EVERYTHING! (except..)

The blue fin at the top falls off alot!

"Barack_Obama","2007-11-06T16:54:34.28Z","Not bad at all","Well the airliners from all the older sets are now officially learjets! I can see where Lego was going with this one. Good design and excellent size. Great cabin and lots of playability.
 
Pros:
Massive
Love the cabin interior, complete with two classes, TV, rinks cart, basin and    suitcase storage and a nice cockpit.
Interesting door design which works great

Cons:
The airstairs are ridiculous
The engines are horrible
The two big nose sections have a small gap between them (at least on mine)
A big airliner with just a few people, one of which is a ground crew staff and then he conveniently takes off his fluorescent jacket and serves drinks in his jet fuel odour! Hmmmm. Airhostess would be great and figures for at least half the seats. Also what is the point of boasting with a two crew cockpit if there is only one pilot.

The set is great, but its just the little things. Recently Lego is becoming more stingy with figures and more reliant on big shaped pieces which kinda defeats the purpose of a building block.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

1 word, WONDERFUL! could have done with more minifigs though... have to agree, 2007 sets made by Lego were rather stingy with the minifigs, but the design beat the cons flat down!

It has double row seating, and has space for passengers to move around! The kitchen area is cool too. My favorite part of it is the realistically made sink. Now the cockpit controls are one of the best features. There is a whole bunch of controls like a real plane! I also like it how there is room for a co pilot! The doors are made realistically too! This thing is huge! It's one of my favorite transportation sets of all Lego transporation set. I highly recommend it for city builders like myself.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pandabaer","2008-03-19T11:47:48.357Z","too big - falls apart","After we built up a few small airplanes my son really wanted this HUGE thing.
But we are rather disappointed by this set.
- almost too big to fly around with 
- wings are too flexible (wobbly during the flight) so engines and the winglets often fall off
- the door mechanisms is clever made like real-  but not stable enough - parts (Arm Mechanical) broken two times
- The landing gear sometimes collapses so we set some extra 2x8 plates between wing and landing gear  
- Some parts like the front and the tail are too big and just one piece 
- Once the airplane is built, the pilot can’t really get out again (see above) and 
- Where is the friendly stewardess and the co-pilot?

Pro
- interior (Trolley, with cups, wash basin Tv)

"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T23:54:42.793Z","Liked it at first, then it all went downhill...","This set became unenjoyable because its giant size made it next to impossible to play with. The set comes with a pilot, worker, passengers, drinks, sink, cargo hold, TV, stairs and lots of controls. I like all of this. It's the wings itself I don't like. They are weak, undecent and made the plane dwarf my entire city. And to and insult, they bend under the weight of the engines. Why don't they make the wings shaped like real and thicker? Also, why doesn't it come with a feature that the wheels can contract? This makes the set unrealistic in a way. Also, how are the minifigs supposed to fit under the doorways without getting hit in the head? Sure I enjoyed it at first, but as my city started to expand, it took up too much space and there was no need for it. Like I said, I enjoyed the accessories, so I took them out when I put the plane into storage. I also took out the 6x10 plates, which were very useful in building buildings for my city. This set is truly overrated. Pricewise, it's okay, but avoid this set unless you want the accessories, because you'll regret it for its behemoth size.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"cbowers","2009-11-16T16:46:11.077Z","Disappointed","I love the aviation theme for Lego. I think its a great idea. I am not totally on board with the way that the new city them has gone. However, the new vehicles have finally won me over with their widths. They just are'nt as compatible with the old ones...more noticeable in the larger vehicles aka trucks/planes. 

This plane, had a lot of potential. I think its too big though, and not realistic for the scale that lego presents. There is a lot of wasted space....and the pieces are too large. Its a shame to ahve the entire cockpit and tail section as on piece each almost. 

I write this review so late, and apparently too late again as it appears lego will be releasing more plasticy planes on the market. I may not be detered from buying them as I love the airports...but I think more pieces for more building options would just plain and simple be more like LEGO.

"dsdoak","2011-05-27T18:14:11.063Z","A good set overall","<p>I like this set. The plane is absolutely huge and is very sturdy. It has some nice features like the boarding stairs and the beverage cart. It needs at least two or three more minifigures as there is seating for 12 but only two passengers. Some people are bothered by the one-piece wings but I don't really care. The plane has 4 engines and looks a lot nicer than the plane in the airport set released the same year.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>

<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This set is a great addition to any city, or to replace the less attractive plane found in the airport set. The price per piece count might seem high, but it contains very large pieces that make it easier for young builders and much more sturdier. It has a few shortcomings that can easily be added from your own collection.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"craigpowers","2011-11-16T00:57:30.74Z","I never thought I'd buy this set...","<p>...especially after first seeing it when it came out. &nbsp;My initial impression was that the line between Duplo and Lego had finally been blurred into oblivion. &nbsp;There were too many big pieces to make this any fun at all. &nbsp;What was Lego thinking? &nbsp;I liked the scale, but the nose, tail, and wings were certainly an about-face to everything I had ever come to expect from the company. &nbsp;Sometimes, in life, the first impression is not always the right one, and the more I would look at this set, the more I wanted to have it; and, now that it is a part of mine and my son's collection, I regard it as one of my favorites. &nbsp;Why the change of heart? &nbsp;Simple. &nbsp;Lego really only made some very large specialty pieces for the set; everything else about it was distinctly Lego, especially the attention to detail and the clever assembly.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Aesthetics/Scale. &nbsp;The very parts I hated about this plane have become the main reason why I love this set so much. &nbsp;The sculpted nose, tail and wings lend to a very sleek, fast look, that actually makes the plane look realistic, and that will always be a plus in my book. &nbsp;I always wanted bigger airplanes from Lego as a kid, and they never really delivered until my son was of age to begin building himself. &nbsp;The fact that this set exists proves that some wishes are fulfilled, even if they come about 15 years too late. &nbsp;Finally, Lego made a plane that could fit two pilots side-by-side, and had two rows of passengers WITH an aisle between them.</li><li>Painted nose/tail assemblies. &nbsp;Lego did the right thing with this set and had the logos and striping that overran onto the nose and tail sections painted, rather than have you apply them as stickers. &nbsp;This really gives the plane's color-scheme a more legitimate look, rather than one that is forced on by stickers that may or may not line up properly. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they didn't have the sense to stick with it, as every airplane since has decals that blend the color schemes onto these parts.</li><li>Interior. &nbsp;Although it may not be as polished as it could be (room for a lavatory?), the interior has many nice features, including a detailed cockpit, first class and economy class seating, and a flight-attendant/baggage area to the rear with beverage cart. &nbsp;Again, given that previous aircraft made by Lego were only wide enough to seat one person and had no aisle, this new scale is a definite bonus for playability and realism.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Where are all the passengers? &nbsp;Apparently, Lego minifigures must be made of gold or elephant tusks, as the company has certainly sold us short on bodies in this set. &nbsp;This is a plane begging to be filled with all kinds of characters - and you get two and just one pilot. &nbsp;What commercial plane doesn't have a co-pilot, at least, and would it really kill Lego to have a flight attendant and one or two more passengers? &nbsp;Even if it bucked up the original price $15, adding about 4 more characters would have done nothing to hurt the sales of this set, but I'm assuming Lego figured we already had enough eager passengers at home from our other sets, or would be willing to shell out the dough for more (I think they're right about that, but I'd like to believe I have a good argument).</li><li>Landing gear. &nbsp;Yes, I fawned over the aesthetics of this airplane already, but I will say that the landing gear is rather atrocious, especially the main gear below the wings. &nbsp;Lego provided us with functionality, but threw out any appeal in the process. &nbsp;The gear is sparse, just enough to serve its purpose, and it just hangs there, unable to tuck up, and is really just down-right ugly from all angles.</li></ul>
<p>Apparently I am not the only person who really likes airplanes and happens to like Legos, as this set is very hard to find, and the ones you do come across are quite pricey. &nbsp;If you are in the market for one, get ready for a bid war that may take you over $100 for a used set, or shell out $200 for a new one (I should have bought 20 of these 5 years ago as an investment). &nbsp;But I firmly believe that this set is worth the extra you may need to pay to get your hands on it, especially if you like the airport subgroup as this airplane is like the Lego flagship for that.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Pharoh_of_Dinosaurs","2011-10-14T18:24:46.813Z","One of my first sets (and reviews)","<p>This is an awesome set. It has a wide variety of peices, it is very fun to play with, when displayed it looks&nbsp;very realistic, and last but not least. . . It's Huge! Also ,as mentioned in the title, it was one of the first sets I got in my Lego&nbsp;superfan era. Anyway, here are the pros &amp; cons&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>It looks awesome 
<li>It's fun to play with 
<li>It has several nice pieces 
<li>It's very big (can seat 11 minifigures) 
<li>Despite the playabillity, it's quite sturdy 
<li>Mabey this is just me, but I like the design and pieces of the turbines</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>There isn't much of a cargo hold.&nbsp;Just a place for 2 suitcases that fall out constantly.</p>
<p>Would it really have killed Lego to put in a couple of extra minifigures? Think, they could have put in a couple of much needed passengers, and mabey a flight attendent or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Again, this is an awesome set. Pricewise I don't know because I didn't buy it.&nbsp;Any way, if you can find this at a reasonable price, go ahead and buy it. You'll enjoy it greatly.</p>

"lukethebrickdude","2014-10-08T20:21:05.397Z","A great addition to your City airport","<p>This set is one of&nbsp;my personal favourite&nbsp;LEGO sets of all time. I have had so many memories with it when I was younger, and I still do.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are straight forward and so simple, but there is lots of content packed into a single booklet, and I think that there could be two, rather than just one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are lots of big parts that&nbsp;<em>can&nbsp;</em>take away from the building experience, but they don&#39;t always, depending on who you are.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get a nice range of minifigures, but I would have liked to see a lady stewardess or something included.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a pleasant experience and is actually very quick and easy for the size of set. It took me inbetween&nbsp;30 minutes to an hour, and it was quite simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is&nbsp;<strong><em>HUGE!&nbsp;</em></strong>and I really like how much playability and the amount of realistic features that have been incorportated in ths set. The attention to detail is very impressive and something LEGO doesn&#39;t always do is try to focus on this too much.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is just a must-have for any LEGO collector, and it is arguable the best City plane by LEGO.</p>

"calzonie","2022-07-03T05:20:57.37Z","An Essential Piece of LEGO City","<p>The passenger plane is pretty close to perfection. The first thing you&#39;ll probably notice is the sheer size of it. I always remembered it being&nbsp;big, but as I was rebuilding the plane it really dawned on me just how BIG this thing is. The exterior is mostly made up of large specialised parts. They&#39;re not parts that you could reuse for many non-airline MOCs,&nbsp;but I don&#39;t think it could have been done any other way without a major sacrifice in looks. The interior features an&nbsp;impressive&nbsp;11 seats for passengers, with a few that swivel in the front section for the &quot;first class&quot; experience.</p>

<p>An obvious&nbsp;complaint someone&nbsp;might have for this set, considering its size and seat count,&nbsp;is the&nbsp;lacking number of&nbsp;minifigures.&nbsp;The&nbsp;only ones included are a pilot, a marshaller, and 2 passengers. But it&#39;s almost a blessing in disguise to have so many empty seats. As soon as I finished the set, I went to&nbsp;find some of my favorite&nbsp;figures from my collection to fill the&nbsp;flight to capacity. Having&nbsp;more minifigs included is always nice, but I don&#39;t think it needed another handful of random townsfolk using recycled parts when you could fill the space with pretty much anybody that fits inside. That said, it could have benefited from a couple of extra airline workers.&nbsp;The cockpit feels incomplete without&nbsp;the&nbsp;co-pilot,&nbsp;and the beverage cart needs&nbsp;a flight attendant to push it (although the marshaller might be meant to&nbsp;double as a flight&nbsp;attendant, based on the shirt under his vest).</p>

<p>The main issue I take with the build is that the&nbsp;wing piece&nbsp;creates&nbsp;barriers inside the aircraft, and they&nbsp;almost completely box in the middle section. Obviously with it being a toy that&nbsp;has&nbsp;a removable roof,&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t really matter if the characters have to do some imaginary jumping to get from one end to the other. But it would have been really cool if there were a clear path all the way through, especially for the aforementioned beverage cart. The only other small problem is that the doors are tricky to open and shut. It&#39;s a very tight fit, although that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is&nbsp;a fantastic set that is yet to be matched in both size and quality! If you have enough&nbsp;room for it, I would say it&#39;s an essential part of any LEGO city.</p>
