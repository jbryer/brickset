"brickzone","2007-05-06T10:17:12.623Z","Not all on board","By and large, this is a good set. The airport, while stylised rather than entirely practical, is stylish. Those windows, glass roof, control tower, glass walkway; all really smart. The attention to detail is nice with the security point, luggage carosel, computer stations, etc.

The aeroplane is, like the other new one, nice and wide to allow two rows of seats; which is great. The hull pieces are also nice and streamlined, yet still modular. I'm not so sure about the wings being a single piece (the cross-bits block the plane passageway) but it does provide stability. Nice detail here too with slots for two suitcases, a drinks trolley, and a little sink. The control console in the cockpit is nice too.

Here's the big disadvantage. This set has two passengers for a plane with eight passenger seats, nevermind the seating for six in the airport. There are three staff, which isn't in fact a lot. Lets see, there is a captain, but no co-pilot. There isn't a steward/stewardess either. The remaining two people run the airport by themselves; one has the luggage buggy (which though nice, has to double as the parking tug for the plane); but also has to direct the plane with the light batons. The other can either man security/check-in, or else the observation tower.

Considering the RRP, 5 people seems rather mean.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Beren","2007-06-09T03:10:40.983Z","Wonderful set - but. . .","This is a great set and lots of fun to build.

Pros:
Great plane
Some nice touches (luggage conveyor belt, security, tower, gangway)
Good to have a baggage vehicle

Cons:
No runway or taxiway!!! Why don't set like this have HEAPS more baseplates???
I wish Lego would include more minifigs with sets",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"elvaro","2007-07-04T02:50:39.107Z","totally asthetic","I just bought this airport and I think is really NICE! I didn't really like the given red plane cause it looked more like a cargo one so I bought the passenger plane to go with this airport. 

There is actually quite a no. of flaws, like no stairs to get to to the control tower, only one check in counter and one gate for the plane. But I have to say the entire building is actually really nice, especially if put under spot light. I think it was very creative for Lego to create the luggage check in and the passage way ( dont know what is the actual name ) to the plane is also very cute. Overall, I would love to give a 4.5 but I think I round up instead. Really a very cute set and is definitely worth collecting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Elle82","2008-01-01T19:04:15.39Z","Border Security","Sounding like a broken record, i know its a toy, but a bit of realism. The control tower is facing the wrong way, people come into the front of the airport...and the control tower is looking out the same way.....wonder where the planes are supposed to land. No baseplates, and its not easy making a decent runway out of road plates. Lack of minifigures, what a poorly staffed airport! the same day i built it i had destroyed most of it in favor of adding things that real airport have, like stairs! (and a mcdonalds) There was also no sniffer dogs..tutt tutt",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legowarroir","2007-10-02T16:28:51.873Z","Fun airport","I got this for christmas and it is very fun but their should be ladders or stairs to go uptop. The airplane is really cool but the wheels keep coming off when I move it on the ground. It is cool how we put the luggage on the luggage mover and it moves when we turn uptop.


                   Pros.
                   Airplane is cool on the out side and inside
                   Luggage mover

"TXClark","2007-12-27T22:52:47.95Z","Wide Open Spaces","This was one of several sets under the christmas tree, as with the other city sets I enjoy the little details but the Airport seemed to be a little boring. A lot of wide open space. The huge box could of included some runway plates too like previous Airport sets. The plane was nice though as with the bigger 7893 Plane. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-07-28T18:14:04.56Z","Your flight is now boarding","This set is quite decent<br>a<br>pros: The airport has a lot of windows and a waiting center like real airports do. The luggage load up and pick up works perfectly by sliding the suitcases around on a rack. The inside of the airplane is detailed, equipped with a cockpit, seats, suitcase storage, and a trolley containing green pieces that are pitifully meant to pass off as food. The air control center on the top floor is accurate as well:inside are binoculars, two computers, and a chair for the air traffic observer. The set even has a boarding ramp and a portable stair case.<div><div><br>cons: The tail fin on the plane collapses easily and the wheels are weak as well. The airport is a little small for my tastes, it could have a moving walk way or some sort of vending station.<br><br>I suggest buying the century airport in the town collection and this one to have a complete air base.</div></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,3
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-12-30T16:38:04.123Z","Mixed feelings","This was the airport released in 2007. The one before this one was the 10159 City Airport, a re-release of the airport from 1994. Although I don't own 10159 or its predecessor, from visual inspection, 10159 already looks better than 7894. Although this airport has many flaws, some parts of it aren't a complete disaster.

The smallest part of the set is the yellow cargo car. It is simple in design and includes a fire extinguisher, wrench, walkie-talkie, suitcases, and a dolly. A driver/person in charge of the cargo is included. Nothing special so far.

The airplane is the next part of the set. In my opinion it is better in design than 7893 because the engines are placed at the back, therefore not causing the wings to bend due to its weight. It has a red colour scheme. The interior includes a sink, shelf for the suitcases, seats, cups, TV (it's a computer screen), and cockpit with controls. There is also non-retractable landing gear which isn't cool if the plane is 35 thousand feet in the air and the 600 mph wind causes it to snap off! I don't like how the wings are one large piece and not made out of individual plates. A hook on the front wheel allows you to clip a beam on and taxi the airplane. Two passengers and a pilot are included.

The last part is the airport itself. The overall design is somewhat flawed due to its openess and lack many important details. However, you get many of those special 2x2x10 pillars and special curved glass panels. Also, the entrance is a set of rotating doors. There is a computer, luggage check in, and rotating luggage belt on the right side first floor. To the left, there is a staircase leading up to the walkway and onto the airplane. I like how futuristic the glass covering the walkway looks. Wheels suporting the walkway allow it to swivel. The control tower is pretty cool with its computers and even spyglasses to look far. A crew minifigure is included.

My biggest complaint is the second floor. It is separated by the control tower, with two chairs and a flower pot on each side, without a doubt, this is the waiting area. And as everyone can see, it is out in the open. This is definitely not a good idea if there is someone falling asleep while waiting for their arrival and then suddenly a large jumbo jet screams overhead at 120 dB. Also, a gift shop and a small cafe should've been included, thus calling for the expansion of the entire airport.

Overall this airport is mediocre. As mentioned before, it has many useful pieces but that doesn't to justice on its lack of realism and important details. A runway also would've been nice, why isn't there one?! At $119.99 CDN it was okay but still not a masterpiece. Lego is releasing a new airport next year (3182). I saw it, and it looks better than this one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It also contains the ladder that I would like to have. It also has many other nice details. Another aspect is that the control tower is not attached to the building. However, it doesn't have a gate! Finally, this version has the engines at the back of the plane, so that the wings don't bend down.</p><p>Overall, this wasn't a bad set, and it is a perfect starter set for one who wants to collect on planes.
