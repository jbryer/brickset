Engine is same as the recently realeased big planes. The engine hoist is a little flimsy but works well if you are gentle with it. Overall a good inexpensive set to add to your town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

If your a fan of tools, jet engines or a city collector this set is for you. Don't get me wrong its a nice little set but to play with, how many times can he fix that engine?

I got it just to add to my collection of small models and is making a great display at the moment.

Overall I give it a 6/10 its a good little set considering its like $5. What do you expect?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Stash","2007-12-20T12:27:52.28Z","Great rare pieces for only 3.50","I just picked this up at the lego outlet and I must say it is a superb set for only 3.50

Mini-fig:

A great little maintenence figure with a cool head. Not much more to say other than that I would still like to see more printed arms/legs/backs on figures. 

Tools:

You get 6 tools with the set including some that are not so common like the screwdriver the figure is holding. You also get an oil-can, a drill, and some wrenches. Great additional pieces for a low price. No collection can ever have enough accessories. I don't mind that they all can't fit on the rack as I see these small sets as expansion modules for the bigger sets that are all coming out and they are just a great way to add value to your collection. The &quot;rack&quot; for the tools is also a nice rare piece instead of the usual 1x1 with the claw. 

Crane:

This is what really makes the set valuable to me. The crane pieces are hard to find anywhere other than in more expensive sets and are great bits for a parts bin for mods. Some say the crane is unstable but I don't find any problems with it, and it is easy to add a few pieces to flesh it out. Given the fact that these rare pieces are so cheap I can't imagine complaining about the base of the crane. 

Engine:

A big cool engine. Not much else to say other than this would be a great way to add a few more engines to your jumbo jet if you wanted to. I believe the piece is the same as ones the new giant airplane set uses. 

For 3.50, this set can't possibly rate anything less than a 5, and I don't understand why so many people rated it lower. These new sets just aren't being appreciated for the value people are getting I think. Some, like the castle knight, are not spectacular, but I really think this set gives you all the value you could ever want out of 3.50 and some really nice pieces that are not easy to find other places.

"claherre","2008-12-27T20:24:34.187Z","A very original set!","I really like this set. In a certain way, it addresses the need of an airplane mechanic, something missing since the first airport set (at least I don't remember any other one).

But the engine is out of scale, and how can it be fixing a jet engine in open air? An hangar will be right at place with this tiny set inside.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"wrathofgod22","2011-04-23T09:18:35.903Z","A repeat version","<p>I'm quite excited to find this set at my local toy shop.</p>
<p>When I brought home to compare with 2928, I realised the 6 'unique' tools are all the same in both sets.</p>
<p>But the set comes with a lifting crane arm and a plane engine, making it value for money for a small set.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;must buy for all City airport collectors!</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,4
