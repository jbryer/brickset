"David1971","2007-03-12T17:23:44.95Z","Lovely","A great value set (under five pounds in UK) with a very nice vehicle with opening doors, and two nice cupboards in the back which actually have room for the accessories in them, and as you can see the doctor has one of those portable heart defibrillator things so you can shout CLEAR! as he brings another minifig back to life. Excellent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T01:11:43.39Z","Great set - Little price!!!    Groovy mini man.","The doctor is just plain cool. I like the simple basic design of the car with doors (aahhh). Quick to build under $6.00 in USA or on S&amp;H, which is where I got mine from because I wasn't able to find it in my town at any store. Only draw back is those darn stickers. But this set deserves a solid 5....",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Town","2008-05-20T12:08:25.61Z","Sleepy designers","The car has quite an ugly design- certain bits seem to have just been stuck to it. The doors are pointless and you still need to take the top off to put the doc inside. The car looks ridiculously boxy from the back because of those back-to-back storage units. And when you hold the car from the top the lights keep falling off due to a four-on-two prong connection. The doctor is quite nice and friendly-looking though, and I love his briefcase. Only in Legoland do doctors still make house calls.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-20T11:26:12.263Z","Call the doctor, please!","Now this vehicle isn't exactly top but it does has many nice features. The roof looks very cluttered and the round wheel housings look too juniorized. However the small cupboard at the back is a nice touch and they even give you a pair of these. The portable health scanner carried by the doctor seems nice too and there are many colored transparent bricks found in this set (mostly for the use of vehicle lights). Do not use stickers as they are one of a MOCer's worst nightmares. The design is terrible so I created a civilian convertible alternate model as found on http://blackbulbcreations.blogspot.com/2007/06/7902-doctors-car-alternate-model-01.html",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"pod120","2009-02-21T05:04:43.903Z","The Doctor Is In!","This was one of my Brother's first Lego City sets, which he got in July 2006.It is a great idea to have a separate car and Doctor to make house calls or to appear when needed in a traffic or even train accident!

Pros
-Includes Doctor with different colour hair to that of the one in 7892
-Includes Blood Pressure Monitor and Suit Case aswell as compartments to store them
-Set works well with 7890 Ambulance

Cons
-Set has stickers
-Could of included a few more accesories",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-06-01T00:11:37.36Z","The suitcase is full of lollies.","This is a reasonably average set with no particularly interesting features... not really intended for adult collectors like me, but my village needs a medic to take care of its citizens.

I quite like it when small sets have lots of accessories, for example 7942 Off-Road Fire Rescue with its abundance of tools and features, but this set only has a small ambiguous medical device of no particular design and a suitcase... although I guess that's  more than other sets of this size.

Also, why doesn't the car have a license plate? It seems to be a standard feature on all lego vehicles these days.

On the whole, not the most exciting lego car around, but not disappointing either.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-07-11T12:51:05.7Z","it has car doors!","I have read reviews on city sets and found out that people like city sets with car doors. if you like car doors in city sets then I think you should get this set because you can get car doors for a cheap price.
