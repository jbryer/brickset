"Cashcleaner","2007-03-01T23:50:03.873Z","Best helicopter kit thus far","I just picked this kit up on March 1st for $29.99 CAN and at that price, it's a steal!

First off, the model itself is MASSIVE and features several rescue-oriented accessories.  The kit also includes two EMTs and a patient with stretcher.  Building the kit was a bit of a challenge and there were a few pieces I had realised I missed at the end.  When completed, it displays very well and really fits in with the other rescue models for the LEGO City line.

I really don't have any complaints with this kit, other than the rotors being a little flimsy, but that's only a minor annoyance.  It's pretty close to perfect in my opinon!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-02T08:37:44.31Z","Excellent value for money","Few LEGO sets are a real steal, but this is definitely one of those. The model is absolutely huge and comes with every feature and accessory you could ask for: a working winch, three hatches and a working canopy, even a saw and first aid kit are included. When assembled the model is surprisingly solid and the design of the rotor is inspired: unlike the sets of yesteryear, the blades aren't unrealistically small and yet they spin fast and long with only a small push. 

There are a number of very small issues: the included minifig patient's colouring was either defective or poorly chosen, as the torso was far darker (almost brown) than the bright-orange trousers. The nose wheel cannot turn left or right, though that is easily fixed by adding a small part. Lastly, while the interior is spacious, it's impossible to fit the stretcher, patient and medic in unless you simply pile them on top of each other.

Building the set is straightforward - the hardest part is setting up the winch, which requires you to thread a small wire through an even smaller hook. A sticker sheet is included for the tail and roof emblems and registration number, though the model looks fine without them. 

All in all, a terrific set that perfectly complements any LEGO city.

Its nice to have 3 mini figures, two pilots/rescue workers and a civilian to help. I like the stretcher and the way it can be hoisted up to the helicopter. This a solid set that is fun to build and fun to play with. I recommend this to any town/city collector. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Doctor_Sinister","2007-07-02T18:23:09.047Z","Perfect in every way.","I love this helicopter - it's modern, stylish and functional.  At first I baulked at buying it as I already have the large Res-Q chopper (6462) and I thought I would just be duplicating helicopters (Tabletown has loads of them already!) but in the end I caved in and I'm glad I did.

Firstly - it's quite big, larger than the box art would suggest, to me at least.

Secondly, the cockpit is (mostly) airtight and the side windows are brilliant - as is the winch stowage (I like all my tools tucked away).  It also has wheels, an added bonus (6462 does not).  The storage of the stretcher is great, you can even stuff the second crewmember in there once you've made the pickup if you don't mind him floating loose a little.

The rear fins are lovely - if this chopper were all black, it would make a great Airwolf-type aircraft.  :-)

I also love the exhaust vents atop the engine and below the rotors.

Talking of the rotors - I was at first disappointed that they did not use two of the rotors as seen in 7238 - but once it was built I knew why - firstly, the rotors can fold for storage and secondly, the rotor assemble is HUGE, it really feels like this is a working chopper as a result.

If I could rate this higher than a 5 I would.

"elvaro","2007-08-09T11:35:16.927Z","Good but not GREAT","I think that this set overall apperance is very aesthetic. It looks really realistic and I thought that idea of the door ( at the back of the helicopter for the stretcher to come ) was good. However, the interior of the helicopter is to small. After fiting the stretcher with the consturction worker into the inside, there is no room for you to put the medic ( since there are 2 medics and one of them is piloting the helicopter iteslf ) . Lego could have made the space bigger so that the medic could at least sit or something. But comparing this set to its counterpart ( which is the hospital itself ), i think is really not that bad.

"omgbrick","2008-01-02T16:34:47.937Z","Good copter, different minifigs, bad winch","Although I got this a while back the minifigs I got were different then the ones pictured above. There are three minifigs the two medics both having white uniforms (not the orange ones pictured) and one had sunglasses while the other had regular glasses. They have a light grey briefcase (medical supplies) and some binoculars along with a radio. All of which can be stored in the side of the copter in the small containers or in a clip on the side of the helicopter. The patient I got was a construction worker with orange overalls and a blue shirt instead of the guy in the above picture.
The helicopter is a quick build like all CITY sets but the end result is huge. It looks a lot like a modern rescue helicopter. There’s a working winch on the side of the helicopter it is meant to raise and lower the stretcher. However I find its hard to do that since there’s only a string which is meant to be tied around the stretcher but no matter how I tie it the stretcher always ends up steeply tilted to one and often falls out because there’s nowhere for the hook to clip onto. This could have been solved if they simply added a stretcher holder into the set.
Moving on there’s a hatch in the back of the helicopter that can open to allow the stretcher to be pushed into the cabin of the helicopter. A large window piece is used as a gate way into the cockpit.  The cockpit can comfortably sit a fig and has a printed 2 by 1 tile and an Exo-Force robot arm as a joystick. The cockpit windshield is on hinges to allow for easy access for the pilot. The main rotor and the tail rotor spin very well and surprisingly, don't break easily 
Overall this is a good sturdy set (the rotors don't fall off to easily). 30 dollars is a good price for this set because of its size. Because of the civilian fig it has good playability though I really hate the winches inability to move the stretcher. 4.5/5

"legobear","2007-10-27T20:39:03.107Z","Perfection","Initially when I saw this, I thought it was big and ugly (the lighting at LEGO store).  I decided I was going to past this up like a bad habit until I gave it a closer look. Three months later I got it and love it! (love helicopters).  

Good Points:
-three minifigs
-lots of spare parts
-simply beautiful and glass all around

Bad Points:
-Wheels are way too big 

Sets have to look good or else I don't get them, and this was magnificent.  Why is this not a coast guard helicopter I have no idea, it looks exactly like one.  I wish they could have included coast guard stickers instead of hospital stickers.  The people writing reviews on this set are right, you'll need to cram the 2nd pilot in if you have the stretcher in there  too.  

Mods: 
Good for modding!  I gave the bottom suicide doors.  Those wheels are too big, so plan on replacing them with smaller wheels.  Modded the entire wheel case system so it looks close to the ground.  I made my own stretcher so everyone can fit.  

Final Statement:
If you love helicopters, get it!  It's a great set no kidding.  One of my favorites now :D

The rotor blades are great and the figures are nice too. Sadly these days Lego often design a large set with few figures, like the airliner 7893, while here they generously give you three, but the doc can't even get in with the patient.

Its a pity that the arm hosts the minifig ( or stretcher! if you can get it to hang like the picture on the box ) into the wheel, they could have positioned it better and you kinda have to cram the men in tight with the stretcher in, so just enough niggles to drop it to 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-07-11T09:11:51.78Z","I Loath That Winch System","OK, well it must be about two years since I bought this set and it proved to be, well, an interesting mix.


Price - ???/10. I picked it up for about just over Twenty Euro, so I'd say thanks to the piece to price ratio it would be average.

Build - 7.2/10. Hard to say... the winch got me quite frustrated trying to slip it through and knot it, but apart from that it was good fun!

Minifigs - 7/10. Unfortunately disappointing. The Minifigs shown on the Internet image are actually not the ones you get in the set. The actual ones are a minifig with a standard City head (The one with the stubble), and two Air doctors (If that's what you call them) with white uniforms and blue helmets instead of white helmets and orange uniforms. 

Playability - 8/10. Unlike the build, the playability is not frustrating, providing you don't get completely insane with the winch system. So overall the playability would be the best thing in this set.

Overall - 6.9/10. Descant set with some useful pieces, nice playability, however a little pricey, plus this set isn't completely essential consider there isn't that many patients that would be drowning.

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-07-28T19:36:26.857Z","Amazing","Well, I finally found this set of mine in near perfect condition (save for the rotors which were all lying in a destroyed pile--quick fix) with all the figures still inside of it, so i just had to rebuild and blow off the dust and now, it's as good as new. There's one of those evil tow cables which is essentially useless but comes up strong with the nifty stretcher lift which slides neatly into the copter. All the figures fit in and there's nothing bad to report of the set other than the changed minifigs which in my opinion isn't a bad thing. Great set, 5/5 overall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Sobel","2015-05-15T14:29:04.983Z","One of the last really good helicopters","<p>I bought this set via EBay for 8.50&euro; as an addition to my existing collection of LEGO helicopters. What I really liked on first sight, was the fact, that this model was made out of &quot;normal&quot; LEGO bricks completely. Meaning, no big pre-shaped plastic parts like in modern sets (e.g. 60067...) to form the hull.</p>

<p>This set has everything, a LEGO helicopter needs to have. It comes with an openable cockpit (modern sets tend to have none), a storage section with some nicely designed hatches to protect the interior (60067 for example has none) and a cool moveable winch for rescue operations. It has also two small storage containers and a lot of tools like a walkie-talkie, binoculars, a chainsaw, a medical kit and even a stretcher to work with the hook on the winch.<br />
What I think is also remarkable for a set of medium size is the fact, that it comes with three (!) minifigures! This gives it a great playability.<br />
The build is very easy, not challenging at all. I was finished after some 10 minutes, which i think is pretty fats for a model with almost 250 parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re into LEGO helicopters, like I am, this one is an absolute must have for your collection! I think it is also a very good model for LEGO starters, because of it&#39;s easy build and great playabilty! Thumbs up for one of the last &quot;true-build&quot; LEGO choppers!!</p>

"Bricktech","2014-09-18T01:44:24.58Z","My First Set, And the Best Helicopter LEGO's Ever Made","<p>This being my first set, it&#39;s among my favorite, as it&#39;s what drew me into LEGO.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the last &quot;Large&quot; helicopter&nbsp;LEGO made before they started using the large, specially molded chunks of plastic for the front and back of the helicopter.&nbsp;&nbsp;If people say that&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7738-1/Coast-Guard-Helicopter-Life-Raft"">http://brickset.com/sets/7738-1/Coast-Guard-Helicopter-Life-Raft</a>&nbsp;is better, they&#39;re <strong>wrong</strong>. You can do far more with the 55 or so pieces used to create the back here, than the 15 or so pieces used to make the back of 7738-1.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the last time LEGO used multiple parts for each of the rotor blades (On a large helicopter).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is okay, but should have shown the helicopter lifting the construction worker out of a construction site, not the ocean. The instructions are easy and well detailed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice selection of curved slopes in red and white.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are okay, but nothing special here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fairly straightforward, and no large, specially molded parts here, just normal bricks and slopes. :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks <strong>awesome</strong>, and is very playable. You can open the sides of the helicopter, as well as the cockpit and a ramp in the back to load the stretcher onto (Or off of) the helicopter. The string&nbsp;included to pull up the stretcher is a nice play function as well, though it won&#39;t work (As in loop around the stretcher and hold it at that angle)&nbsp;as shown in the main image.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a&nbsp;<strong>great</strong>&nbsp;set! It&#39;s very easy to modify any way you&nbsp;like, unlike&nbsp;today&#39;s helicopters.&nbsp;Once I even swapped out all of the colors for a military color scheme (It looked amazing).</p>

<p>It&#39;s at that perfect point after the old overly brick-built&nbsp;helicopters, and before the new very simple ones with the large chunky pieces.</p>

<p>An interesting note: The rotors can be folded for storage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I saw that some of other reviewers said that they got different minifigs with theirs, or that the model was fragile. In *my* case, the model was sturdy, and I got&nbsp;<strong>exactly</strong>&nbsp;what is shown on the box.&nbsp;</p>

Even better options for city helicopters. I do have some nostalgia for this set because it was one of my first ones, but when I look at it from a objective view, it simply looks bad. I know it is a little old, but even compared to other sets from that time, It looks pretty rough. The figures are fine, nothing amazing. On the bright side, the pieces from this set are incredibly useful. It has a string piece, some very nice wheels, and a stretcher. I would recommend passing on this set.</p>

As soon as the man fell into the river of LEGO City, the pilot minifigure shouted a phrase I will never forget:</p>
