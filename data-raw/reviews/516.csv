It's a pretty good little model, little being the operative word. Still, it looks cool, tough and rugged and the neat little aerial is a nice touch. Also, plenty of tools dotted about - if I were a town collector I'd definitely want a good couple of these on my fire fighting force. I think the standard grin with eyebrows head is a bit odd though (especially for a fireman, since a job that puts you in close proximity to flames on a daily basis would more likely lead to a distinct lack of eyebrows) and, when compared to its partner, 1704, (which in my opinion shows how truly awesome TLG can make a small vehicle) the attraction of this pales somewhat. Still, a nifty little jeep well deserving of an 8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The front and side of the 4x4 are really detailed and can seat a minifig which is even better. A good set to own if you are a town fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
