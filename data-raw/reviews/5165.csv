I like the use of red and orange pieces in this set and you can make alot of automobiles with this set. It is probably the best of the X-pod series.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-02T06:26:29.497Z","Orange and Red Cheese Slopes","This is a wonderful X-Pod set. This set makes me wish there were more of these being produced still. The selection is great for car builders but those of us who love creating with the cheese slope love this set because there are 6 red and 2 orange cheese slopes. The slope brick for the windshield is one of my favorite pieces as well. I have used it for a go-kart MOC. The color scheme is pleasing to the eye. I would have loved to see this set produced in other colors (green with lime accents, blue with dark  blue accents). I have 3 X-Pods and this is my favorite.
