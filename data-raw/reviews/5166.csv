"Imperial13","2007-07-28T15:09:43.457Z","The Best X-POD EVER!","The robo pod is one of the only pods that actually appealed to me.The robot with lasers, and you can pretty much build anything from the X-Pod theme, like i've probably made about 10 different models using this set. It also comes with the ever usefull pod storage.  IT COMES WITH CHROME!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-08-07T18:26:21.393Z","Nice Pieces, nice robots","I got this set in the mail from my Brickmaster subscription, and it still is one of the better ones.  I own no other X-pods, but this one is pretty sufficient.  I like the pod design, and how it is incorporated into one of the designs.  I also like the trans-blue elements, and the chrome ones.  This set goes well with the robobots set and the little robots set.  Very good set overall.

"vezon8764","2008-09-28T22:09:20.967Z","KOOL X-POD ROBO SET!","I was a large X-Pod collector, as it started with the red pod, and unfortunately, ended with the 2007 robo pod. By that time, my X-Pods had almost completely merged with my other pieces, and so I lost interest in X-Pods. This, however, was one of my favorites, as it includes one of the last &quot;rolling pod&quot; instructions. With a few silver pieces and lots of dark blue clear pieces, including a lot of white, added with the size of an X-Pod, equals a lot of fun, that can fit inside your pocket!
Pros:
3 models
cool robot
half posable
rare pieces
Cons:
half posable
limited piece combinations
Get it if you want to finish your X-Pod collection, but I would suggest the blue jet X-Pod for a starter set.
