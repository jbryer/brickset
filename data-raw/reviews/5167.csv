Costing about 5 dollars there is three main models that can be made from the parts, the plane, a helicopter , and a little robot that uses the pod.

The entire set is packaged in a small plastic container that can be used in Lego creations or it can be used for part storage. The instruxction manual is one piece of folded paper with instructions for all of the models.
All three models are very strudy and look good the little plane is very detailed and swooshable the helicopter is the same. The last model is okay but I'm not sure what it's supposed to be though it does use the Pod. 
Over all this kit is a great parts pack it has some 1 by 1 slopes some blue wing peices and a few other useful pieces. I suggest buying one. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The jet model is decent, but the yellow rods on the side break off too easily. Otherwise, this would be a great travel set. The helicopter model is my personal favourite, as I thinks it looks the nicest. I have no idea what the third set is supposed to be, but it has little playability. I like the colour scheme, and all the x-pods are good for road trips (providing the kids aren't likely to spill it in the car). I got this for Christmas years ago and would probably not have bought it on my own. I would suggest that you only buy this set if you are going on a long car trip and want to avoid the ""are we there yet"" problem.</div>",FALSE,3,3,3,4,5
