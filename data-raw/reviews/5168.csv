"ratz","2006-08-23T07:59:35Z","very nice indeed","as most of the other x-pods this one is really good: the organic shapes of the dino are being met without ny bionicle parts, in fitting colours (lime green plates!), and without any new gray. all extremities, head and tail are moveable, so you can pose the dino just as you like (though the arms are somewhat limited). good parts also, nothing to complain about this excellent set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-09T20:39:36.39Z","Green Dino Runs Rampant through Legoland Knocking Down Power Lines, Thousands Without Power!","Green and lime green plates and bricks. Awesome! The dino is highly jointed (movable legs, arms, tail and neck). The X-Pod is a cool color itself and even the black bricks are rare (tooth plates, tail pieces, sloped bricks). My one major complaint is that this is the most fragile/weak LEGO model I have ever built.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-11-13T19:47:59.013Z","Not really all that good.","This set is supposed to be one of those sets that supports creativity and all that. Well, to get this over with, its not. It really isn't. With more pieces and not all these small models, it would be pretty good. The best pod is always the robo pod, so just buy those",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-07T10:29:33.46Z","LEGO Creator (X-Pod) - Dino Pod Review","This set may doesn't have a lot of play features but it's still a good little set to have. The build is very easy and we don't need to worry about stickers as well. This set can build a few dinosaur figures. The main figure you get is the one which you can see on the cover of the instruction. The head and the legs are able to move and you can also sviwel the tail and the arms.   As I told you in the beginning: This is a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"CortezTheKiller","2011-01-23T13:31:40.99Z","A great looking set","<p>This set is no longer available, but I strongly advise those who don't have it to try and pick it up for three or four pounds on Ebay (as I did).&nbsp; Not only does it look great but it also comes with lots of good pieces in unusual colours.&nbsp; That said, I've modded mine by adding a tail in black hinged parts per the legs and neck: it looks better than the part supplied.&nbsp; I've also added a line to the jaw so I could insert a white 1x2 piece for teeth.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Simple but brilliantly designed figure 
<li>Posable 
<li>Fun and easy to modify 
<li>Adds some good pieces in unusual colours to your collection</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>None</li></ul>
