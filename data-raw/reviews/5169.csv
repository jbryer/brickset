Once built, I liked both the appearance and sturdiness of the truck. The trailer however was very flimsy and broke easily when adjusted up and down. The little cars are simple and my nephew had hours of fun with them alone. All in all I would give this set a 3 because the flimsiness of the trailer pretty much eliminates the playability of the truck and trailer, the biggest part of the set. For the same money I would recommend set #4939.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

nevertheless the models are attractive, especially the alternative builds as displayed on the back of the box: nice racing cars, cool trucks, plus even more ideas in the instruction book. here they made the best out of the modest brick selection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"moloko","2007-10-15T07:23:00.797Z","Easy to build for young ones.  ","I bought this set on while at Target.  Easy to build.  It is cheap and fun to play with.  When young kids come over I let them play with the pieces.  For 10$ its great buy.  I do see them still on the shelves and may pick up two or three more.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-04-23T15:59:41.36Z"," This set is really cool and nicely built!","  This was my first Creator set and it got me into Creator. You can build it into many other things (the crane is cool when built). It is not for minifigures as you know because Creator doesn't make sets that are minifigure compatible because its always too small or even to big for minifigures. It is cool how it carries the cars and how they detach from the truck or car carrier. It's a unique and small set. It's a great set to play with if you have imagination. Thats my review and I hope it helped you out.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The mini cars are neat!</li><li>The multi-level truck-like the real thing!</li><li>Great for travel!</li><li>Has lots of playability</li><li>Compact but gives you a lot</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The truck mirrors can break off easily</li><li>Nothing else!</li></ul>
<p>This is a very attractive set. It wouldn't integrate well with a city layout as the scale is off, but it is great on its own. This is ideal for road trips for the kids, as the little cars hook on to the truck. I love this set and would recommend it to anyone!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
