"lego12","2008-04-23T16:06:02.233Z","  Great set for people who like to build dinosaurs or just love Creator!","   It is a really fun set to look at and to hold it because it looks like the real thing and its body can move from side to side. You can build it into 8 other different dinosaurs. The red color is a nice touch and to make it even better its horns and feet can also move. There is nothing bad about this set and it is great.

"Si_UKNZ","2011-04-14T18:18:40.357Z","Excellent playability and experience","This set is not one of those you'd look at in the shop and go ""wow"". In fact, I'll be honest, I only got it because it was cheap and for the parts. However I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br>I actually rate it as one of the best sets I've owned, because of the playability. Being able to make so many dinosaurs, but only one or two at a time really encourages kids to keep making it then breakng it up then making it again, which is absolutely what lego should be about. The models are very moveable so fun too, especially if you have a City and need a Godzilla!<br><br>I like the ""shelf candy"" lego, but this is much more educational and engaging and fun, it really brought home to me that the ""build it and leave it like that"" lego with the juniorised parts just misses this point so badly. A great set for making kids 'lego-literate' and 100% what it should all be about.<br><br>(The only downside.. a couple of the models are a little strange looking)<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
