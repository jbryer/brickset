- 2 Elephants
- 2 Zebras
- 2 Giraffes
- 3 Lions
- 2 Penguins
- 1 Monkey
- 1 Polar Bear

The visiting family isn't very intersting, and the settings are simple.  But the animals are great!

We (me and my wife) are expecting a baby now and we want to prepare everything that we could before the baby really arrive.<br><br>Since we both are AFOL, we are thinking that our kids should also join the force when he/she (we still don't know the gender of the baby) grow up. So, we decide to buy a couple of Duplo sets. What we love about this set is the animals. We have , tiger, monkey, giraffe, zebra, polar bear, penguin, and elephant. I think this is enough to teach our child about animals.<br><br>The building experience is quite simple, there's nothing unique here. You just put a brick over another brick to create a gate, rock, etc.<br><br>I think this set is really nice introduction for kids to play with Lego brand products. Also, the set also can help kids to understand more about animals.<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,1,5,4
