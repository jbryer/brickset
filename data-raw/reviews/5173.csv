"Erik_","2009-01-06T17:04:36.17Z","Nice small set","Got this beginner Duplo set while travelling abroad. I didn't want my daughter to have to many pieces, yet some basic new animals to play with.
Probably wish they had put a real Lion instead of a cub in this set.
For me the zoo keeper was not a filler, as my wife has taken care of wild animals, and it's a mini-mom :-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
