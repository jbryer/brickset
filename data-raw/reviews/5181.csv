"Smallsam99","2008-04-19T10:41:13.327Z","Legends! ","I like this bionicle set(one of my few favorites) and it is great! The gold and silver armor and masks work well with a dark green and red color scheme. The armor and masks are also rare. The weapons they wield are also cool. I think the spinners are okay but don't shoot far connected to the toa. Still, it is a good set and reccomend getting it for about $10.00. I gurantee that you won't be disapointed!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-19T18:39:21.17Z","Toa Hagah","This is a value pack of the bionicle theme, and was released in the year of 2005. Including the Toa Hagah Iruini and the Toa Hagah Norik, this is another nice bionicle value pack, and special edition. Toa Norik is well designed, and have the silver and red color schemes. Builted in the same base of the Toa Metru, Norik features some increasings. His feet are two foots in the Toa metru style, with the silver color. The Norik's legs are like the Vahki, well designed, and with two silver armors. The legs fit well on the body's pieces, and the body have inside it, covered by some armors, a gear systems, like the toa metru. A red armor is covering this systems, and a silver armor (in the same shape of the matoran's bodies from 2004) is increasing the body. The shoulders have too the same shape of the shoulders from the Toa metru, but this is covered by two silver small armors, the same included in the Toa Nuva. The arms have the same shape of the toa metru legs, so, it is long in compatison with other toa from 2001-2005. The head is also useful, too used in the current toa sets. The mask is a kiril (the same of Dume and Dekar, but this have a silver color), but the story line changed the name for pehkui. The weapons included, one is a shield that launchs a rhotkua spinner well, and it have a good shape and design. And Norik too have a spear, that have on the top, the axe from Gali Nuva. The other toa hagah included in this value pack, Iruini, have somethings like the Norik, things like the shape, building, gear systems and weapons. Iruini features the gold and green schemes (the gold pieces of Iruini have a different scheme of the current gold on the bionicle theme, but the scheme of the Iruini's gold color is the same with Takanuva, released in 2003). Iruini's feet are gold and with the same shape of the Toa metru. The legs are the same of the visorak keelerak, but it is increased with some gold armors, and these fit well on the body. Inside the body, like all the toa metru and Norik, are some gears making the gears systems, to the arms move in the same time, when the gear on the back still rotating. Unlike Norik, the iruini's body is covered by a shield from a bohrok kal. In the same shape of the Norik's arms, the arms of Iruini are good to move. The weapon of toa Iruini is a &quot;cyclone spear&quot;, and a shield, the same of Norik, but with gold and green colors. The mask included is a kualsi, the same of Defilak, but in a gold color. Overall, these sets like in somethings the Toa Metru, but are more increased. Having a nice design and color scheme, these are well made, this value pack is a good option to get two awesome bionicle sets. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
