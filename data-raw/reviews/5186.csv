It builds many basic models, like cars, buses, planes, ships, buildings and even room settings. The model designs are mostly simple, because they're old designs from the early 70s. Too bad it fell apart years ago, but all pages are still there and put into a folder, so it's preserved. 4/5, since it had so many nice ideas, built with mostly basic bricks.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BrickPiet44","2008-10-01T16:19:42.28Z","A great book for starters","This book has of lot of inspiring ideas for young children who start building with regular bricks. This is a 1973 book so the parts are all regular bricks, plates and windows and wheels. You don&#180;t need all the special parts that nowadays sets (and idea books) contain.
Basic things to build are cars, planes, people, houses and buildings (airport, police station) etc. 
The steps for building need some skill in building with instructions. The sets are made in only a few steps and not as in many nowadays sets almost brick by brick.
I used it a lot when I was a kid and was in need of new ideas. Definitely a book I can recommend if you are searching for an original gift for your six year old son of nephew.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
