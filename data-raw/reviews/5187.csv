"bmwlego","2007-12-26T10:12:28.64Z","Elephant ","Bought this set on clearance at the LEGO store in Orlando while on vacation at Disney World. Cute little set that has a hinged brick for the elephant's trunk. The ears move forwards and back too. The color scheme works well for the subject. This is a basic little set with few parts (34 pieces). The alternate model is a walrus. The 1x2 white plates with minifig handles is used for the elephant and walrus tusks which is a neat idea. If this set wasn't on clearance I would have never purchased it. Cute but not much else.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
