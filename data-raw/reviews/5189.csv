The boat, sorry to say, but doesn't like me, i used some pieces for other lego stuff. By the way you can't expect an super awesome set if it is a promotional, so its another nice set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Quotex","2017-09-21T03:56:13.557Z","A well detailed build for the amount of parts it uses.","<p>I bought this set via bricklink, so I can&#39;t really review value-for-money, as it is a discontinued set.</p>

<p>This is a rather simple to build set, the instruction has 6 easy-to-follow steps to complete the jetski.</p>

<p>The parts themselves are very simple to place, although the Antenna piece has a tendency to fall out of the holes in the fence. so beware when holding it upside down.</p>

<p>The minifigure is nice but would&#39;ve been better if it had a print on the cap, like a few other sets have had (although that was a black cap, this white one contrasts with the black uniform nicely).</p>

<p>Because this is a water vehicle, I decided to put it through a float-test, upon placing it in the water the jetski, unfortunately flipped onto its side. so it&#39;s not recommended for displaying it in dioramas that use actual water.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a simple but effective build.</p>
