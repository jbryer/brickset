First off, as I'm sure everyone would agree, Ice Planet needed a snow plough, full stop. Secondly it looks great, Ice Planet have one of my favourite colour schemes and you've gotta love the chunky tyres for driving through the snow. Plus the wheelbase is long enough, I thought Ice Planet Krysto Ranger (6814) suffered looks-wise because the wheels made it wider than it was long. Thirdly, it's fully equipped with skis, an ice saw and a megaphone piece to plug said saw into - you gotta feel sorry for the Ice Planet guys who wield those things bare-handed! Finally, the compact radar unit on the back with an innovative system of attachment ties it in to the whole satellites/radars scheme of the theme and rounds off an awesome little model. This is proof positive that size doesn't matter, it's only a shame that its availability was so limited - and that no one came up with a name for it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I would a snowplow would be just the sort of vehicle a team with a snow &amp; ice theme would of had. This a great smaller set, unlike the Ice Tunnelator it is better proportioned and looks like an actual vehicle. I can imagine a fleet of these going around the planet, clearing routes and landing places for the larger vehicles. The satellite dish, computer and tools are connected in a simple but highly effective manner, being able to remove it as a sensor post or such adds more playablity to the set. This is one of those legos that prove that a set doesn't have to be one of the big sets to be cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T15:07:51.2Z","Small, detailed, fun = 5/5","Yup this set has what a set needs, good parts, purpose, and some accessories and moving parts.
This set (though hard to come by) is a part of a value pack, and would probably be nice to be named (if only somebody could think of one). The plow adds a nice feature and, if you really want to go into detail, is even cooler since you can swing it side to side if you wanted to move the snow and ice to a specific direction (thus plows normally have an arrow shape). The disconnecting console in the back fits with the series but the alkward part is that Ice Planet sets don't really use loudhailers, but it's good SOMEONE has one (kind of puts the man &quot;in charge&quot;). The set also has some great parts, especially since the radar dish is not that easy to come by. All in all worth its value since, like many great sets, the parts can be used very diversely and creatively (thus a plate with wheels lacks this aspect) adding to the play value for both the collector and builder.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set was only available in this pack&nbsp;and had no official name attached to it. It contains a six-wheeled ground plow vehicle with an&nbsp;<i>Ice Planet Chief minifig</i>.<br />
<br />
This pack included a Fire Chief car as well, separate from the pieces contained in the plow set.<br />
Instructions&nbsp;for both sets were contained in one booklet.<br />
<br />
Nice little builds, the Snow Plow looks awesome with the printed parts being a focal point.</p>

<p><br />
Every snowy driveway, or mountain on Ice Planet needs plowing once in a while!!!</p>
