"ajsantos","2006-04-22T18:27:21Z","Just great","A great set, one of the best service trucks designed by LEGO. The double folding back ramp is unique to this set and duplicates real-life action very well. The largo side doors allow easy access to the milk pack crates (themselves a fun creation). Great colour scheme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I really like the design of the truck which Lego did a great job on and the cartons of milk. The cartons of milk are pretty nice overall and there is nothing wrong with this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Crazy_Chris","2013-05-29T20:32:21.267Z","This should have been a regular set","Like set 1952, I rebuilt 1581 using standard parts and professional made repro stickers. The big white 1x5x4 doors are the rarest parts, but BrickLink helped me to solve that issue.<br><br>The white-blue color scheme is simple, but beautiful. All in all, this milk truck is based on the set 6693 ""Refuse collection truck"", driver's cabin and baseframe are identical. Imho that's quite realistic - many real trucks also share the same frame and driver's cabin.<br><br>1581 offers a double folding back ramp that is quite ingenious. Moreover, we get no less than 24 packs of milk... and there's enough space to put more milk into the truck.<br><br>This set should have been a regular one. It looks nice, it offers working features and great playability.<br>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
