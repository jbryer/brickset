"lewa_rocks","2007-04-25T23:57:59.64Z","This is cool","I realy like this set its 30$ but I think it should have been 25$ but its still pretty good price. If you like Exo-Force you should get it. Its cool I like the tank thing the best. I got mine for cristmas I got uplink and sentary too and all together you can have a good battle. Its a cool set even if somone else says its dumb. Well its up to your apinion. If you like the way it looks get it if you dont then get somthing else.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-27T04:01:09.087Z","good for your money","the gate on this is easily my favourite part, it can be smashed down by the robot battering ram and then if that happens there is a gun which actualy fires behind it to attack, the part on top of the gate where your person sits is fully movable and very cool.
the battering ram is very cool, you get two robots on it( one to steer and one to usethe gun. and the fact it has wheels makes it very cool.
the two battle machines you get are excellent to, especially the robot because of the gun.
with this set you get 5 minifigs and all it costs in the UK is &#163;20!
A definate bargain for money",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-17T12:39:51.497Z","Sort of good","Note to reader: This review is a matter of opinion and should not decide whether you buy it or not but help you choose.

Pros:
2 battle machines!
robot rammer looks good and is fast.
Gate has a gunner ontop.
3 iron drones.

Cons:
Gate is flimsy and unstable.
Gate defender's wings fall off.

Buy if you want a set where you can have a battle without buying more sets.
Don't buy if you want a stable set that isn't to pricey.

The weapons are nice too. overall, 10 out of 10. Cool function: when you try to smash the car into the gate, the gate opening triggers a blunt shooter:)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"asianlego","2008-09-13T13:17:39.483Z","Nice Vehicle and Mechas","The Mechas
Both are really good and just as good as any single boxed mechas such as Cyclone Defender and Claw Crusher.

The Vehicle
I love this vehicle as it reminds of the Warthog from the Halo videogame series. Also love the big crunching wheels.

The Gate:
I don't really like the gate because it looks so thin but I like the idea of having the gun shoot at you when you open the gate.

5/5, I got this set at a Warehouse Sale so it was all very well worth it! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"RCT3Dude96","2011-02-24T00:08:05.17Z","What every set should be like.","The minute I saw it at my local toy store, I knew I had to have it. It just looked so much fun with all the things included, and just as I predicted, it was. This set has an even arrangement of good guys and bad guys, making playability awesome. As well as an awesome arsenal, the value is insane! 402 pieces for just 30$! It even includes large pieces like wheels, plates, and a canon! This set would easily be worth 40$ if Lego ever decided to raise prices. Also, unique pieces like the transparent wings, the gun mechanics and more make this set all the more amazing. All in all, a success. Lego should use this set as reference for all others!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"tkettle9719","2012-01-03T21:12:34.827Z","Gate Battle!","<p>I got this set at full price at Target many years ago, and find it to be a great little set for the price, with two small mechs, a gate, and a battle vehicle to crash the gate.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The set is an actual battle set, and can bring along some mighty heavy playability. <br></li><li>-This set also comes at a great cost for the piece amount, 30 dollars for over 400 pieces. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The gate was a bit of an afterthought, as it was built a bit clumsily and breaks in a matter of seconds after grabbing it. <br></li><li>-I like the vehicle in this set a lot, but the green armor just looks strange, where a silver would have been even more welcome. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is very nice, and is a bargain at even regular price. However, I recommend MOCers to take the gate and build something much more amazing than the flimsy gate. Buy it, but there are risks and flaws. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"123MrBrick","2015-07-13T04:30:17.25Z","The Set Every Exo-Force Collector Needs.","<p>This is probably the best of all of the Exo-Force sets. It has great figures, cool vehicles, and it just packs a lot of play value.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set came in the standard Exo-Force packaging. The front shows the set in action and has a lot of cool embossed sections. The back shows some of the features and has a little mini-comic explaining how the robots are attacking Sentai Mountain. I believe this set had two manuals. Either way, I had no trouble with the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a variety of great pieces. The huge orange wedges on the gate are really cool, and a lot of the pieces that make up the mechs and ramming vehicle are good for MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes a generous amount of figures: Two Exo-Force pilots, and three Iron Drones, who are the bottom tier of bad guys in the Exo-Force world. The red-haired pilot, Ha-Ya-To, has a dual-sided face, which is unique to variants of him. He also has some nice torso detail. The other good guy is a generic Exo-Force pilot, who also has some cool details and crazy hair! The three Iron Drones are all the same and are pretty nicely detailed.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is kind of a challenge. The rammer car was pretty easy to do, but I had a little trouble getting the mechs and gate right. It&#39;s nothing too difficult, though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is amazing. All of the vehicles look awesome, and the gate is cool even if its sturdiness is questionable. All of the action features, like the firing missile, work wonderfully.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great LEGO set. To me, this is a great representation on LEGO&#39;s overall high point. (2005-2008). I have spent hours playing with this set. If you like Exo-Force or just mechs in general, you should look for one. Even if mechs aren&#39;t your thing, you should still consider. You won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>
