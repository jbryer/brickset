"ruidp","2006-06-08T18:24:02Z","very good","This tiny turbos series is very good in all aspects. The cars are very detailed for the size, good lego pieces, lots of special pieces, great wheels, cheap price, great boxes for storage of the cars(lego should improve their boxes).
I have all four tiny turbos of 2006 and I wish I could get the all the others...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-09T09:12:41.493Z","Silvery","There's a whole lot of different Racer sets out there and this one is unique in the sense that there's quite a number of silvery bricks.  Two of those bricks are used as headlights though, which doesn't really seems to make it work, but otherwise, everything looks good.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-06-01T19:44:38.84Z","good parts selection!","this little model works as a toy as well as source for useful parts. 

i just don't understand why these stickers are necessary, the car looks fine as it is in black-silver-orange. Especially the front sticker seems rather superfluous, and it covers the 2 sloped bricks, so you can't disassemble the car without damaging it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-24T15:35:01.53Z","Carbon STAR!","The Carbon Star is a star in the Tiny Turbos series. I love the orange and silver accents. The windshield/cockpit sloped brick is great as is the sloped wedge in the back. The fat wheels work with this car. The sloped bricks in the front are cool (just don't affix the stickers to the set or you will have to decide between ripping the sticker or losing the bricks from your collection. The mudguards are awesome.The engine part is a favorite of mine but what really puts this car ahead of other Racers is the design and color scheme. The best compliment I can give any Racers set is to say that I like it so much I have or will build this same model in a different color scheme. This is one of those sets!

"Gus_263","2008-04-27T11:46:18.717Z","Carbon Star","This is a Tiny turbo from 2006. Like the subtheme, don't have pilot, but have one isn't the idea of the set. So, this deserves be compared with the ideas of this. The wheels were used on previous sets(like a promotional from shell petrol)and works perfectly with the pieces above it. The color scheme isn't a problem of the set, the orange, black, and the silver(in details and pieces, including the numbers and stars)are great together to make a good color scheme(and due to the colors, some pieces are useful and can be replaced if you think that one of these frustrates). The piece to looks like with the glass of this car is placed very next to it's back, and the turbo is on it's front, but it isn't a problem, because the design still cool for that, like some hot wheels cars(that looks like with somethings of the tiny turbos). The playability is too cool, like the other cars from the same subtheme. Have too useful pieces, and the building is solid and don't dismantles easy. Is a cool set, for anyone who wants small cars.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rifraphy","2009-11-03T13:26:25.967Z","Retro-futuristic motorama art deco Tiny Turbo = LUV","This is one of my favorite Tiny Turbos, perhaps because of the fact that is reminds me of the Rogue Sequencer - a Tiny Turbo a friend made, white and sleeker than this one - but what really catches my eye is the black-orange paintjob. Pretty dam flashy. >:)

I see this as very art deco. The clean, round lines, the abrupt ending at the front bumper, the sleek cockpit and the rocket exhausts - or maybe I don't know what art deco means. ;)

Anyway, this set has some really nice parts in sweet colors. Such as, two 1x2 orange tiles, 1x3 dark gray slopes, the racing tires in black, the supercharged V8 engine block, black Tiny Turbo fenders - most poeple probably have these parts, but they are still quite nice. 

It's very sleek when finished, and fun to roll around on the table. ;) I give this astoundingly sleek, shiny (unless you douse it in mud), elegant and with a distinct look of that unexplored range of cars called muscle-supercars...
