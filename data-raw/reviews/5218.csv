I have all four tiny turbos of 2006 and I wish I could get the all the others...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I am in a mixed mind with tiny turbos. Sure, they're fun, but they seem to be a waste, when lego should be doing cars with PEOPLE IN THEM! Those calssic Drome racers were brilliant.
But Fat Trax is a good Tiny Turbo. You can make it do flips, and is fun to crash into other racers. You can have races to build it from scratch the quickest (with or without instructions...).The design is great on this, superb usage of parts. One con is the amount of stickers, though.... ugh.
So if you're a Tiny Turbo fan, get this set.
If you're not, don't.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This, like the others tiny turbos, have well detailed pieces, with designs of flashlights, words, numbers or other designs like flames. The green pieces at the side were too used for tiny turbos, that had a little height, but this, in a good one with big(to tiny turbos)wheels, have this, and keeps a place beetwen the wheels and the green pieces. The color scheme is cool, green and black, also used in cars from racers with pull action. The building is solid and easy, and the useful pieces can be used too to make combination models, or upgrade other cars(tiny turbos or don't). The glass like piece(a black in the center)is low, but cool in design along with the other pieces, like the ramp ones, on the front and back of this. A good thing in this set is the playability to make tricks, with this size and the place between the wheels. This set, the Fat Trax deserves the maximum rate, if compared with other tiny turbos or any little car or set.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
