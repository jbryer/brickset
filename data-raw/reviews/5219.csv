"Monty","2006-02-17T04:34:55Z","Very Accurate Big Rig","Every now and again, Lego produce something that looks really good from not many pieces and it is so simple you wonder why you never thought of it as a moc - this is one of those sets. I am a big fan of American semi - trucks this looks just like a Peterbilt big rig. There are a couple of custom parts for the fenders, but the rest is very simple and looks great. There are aluminium finish bricks for the grille and stacks, but oddly an aluminium sticker for the front bumper that is stuck to a grey brick. Other stickers are included, but I chose to leave mine off. 

As usual I began tweaking to improve - stacks were replaced with chrome equivalents and wheels were replaced with road versions as I have built a reefer trailer to go with mine using spare silver corrugated bricks from 10022 - the whole combo looks great. My only criticism is the price - 3GBP. Whilst this is not much compared to most sets, I think it is a lot for what you get. I realise part of the marketing is the custom racers plastic box, but if they put it in a cardboard one and reduced the price by a third I for one would have been happier. Despite this, it has to be a maximum score and is so cleverly simple and accurate.

"ruidp","2006-06-08T18:25:38Z","very good","This tiny turbos series is very good in all aspects. The cars are very detailed for the size, good lego pieces, lots of special pieces, great wheels, cheap price, great boxes for storage of the cars(lego should improve their boxes).
To me this model is the best of this series.
I have all four tiny turbos of 2006 and I wish I could get the all the others...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-10-30T19:59:02.747Z","Road Hero Perfectly Planned and Executed By LEGO","The Road Hero set is perfect. The pieces are great. Unlike the F6, this set does not suffer from only 2 mudguards and plain red color bricks. The sloped bricks that make up the roof are a nice effect. The silver colored antennas on the side of the Road Hero are a nice touch. The base is 4 studs wide but the majority of the cab is 3 studs wide built using a jumper plate. I was inspired to build a trailer for this set and will be building more versions of this set in different colors. Check out my additions at:

Well onto the pros. and cons..<br/><br/>Pros.<br/>cool<br/>silver pieces<br/>design<br/><br/>Cons.<br/>stickers<br/><br/>Normally i don't get sets without figures so to me this is one of the better sets without any figures.",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
"Rgijaba","2008-02-28T12:56:23.233Z","could ya give me some thing to transport?","road hero is a great set, and is a very detailed simi! it looks fine without the stickers, but looks better with em on! its lacking some thing to transport, but thats easaly fixed with a couple a bricks (i made a rhyme!), its not a good or bad thing, but why  would LEGO have a silver sticker put on the 4x4 bar on the front?! it would have been much easeyer to just have a silver bar! anyhoo, get it if you can, as its a fine addion to most LEGO citys, and a great addion to any TT city!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-28T14:18:32.873Z","On the road!","This was a well made small truck(the size explain the name of the sutheme) from 2006 and from the racers' subtheme Tiny Turbos. Is easy makes little cars, and too trucks, but these rarely appears as sets. This is one of the small trucks, like the F6 Truck, from 2005. This have a different building, and have bricks and plates to makes the part for the driver(don't includes driver, is too small to have one), and to make the glass of the car. One type of plate is included, well designed to be placed above the wheels, but don't the back ones. The front of the set is too good designed, to keeps the building solid. Claw pieces on the sides hangs two pieces that were included very in older sets(as staffs for castle, flags in these and city, and much more other old themes), and also plates at the back parts(have nothing to transport, but don't need that to keep a good rate). This don't have minifigure, altough win playabilty and keeps useful parts. Is also good detailed, the details in white and in black on red parts(like in the ramp piece above) keeps a good color scheme to the set. To make combinations, or other type of building, is easy with these contents. For many reasons this set stays in a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
