"Monty","2006-02-17T04:41:27Z","Looks Better Than I Expected","I bought this after the truck as a source of spares, but i made it up and it actually looks better than i thought - a bit like an old style Astra GTE. There seems to be a custom brick for the rear spoiler and loads of stickers. Once again they could have shaver a third off the price (3GBP) by putting it in a cardboard box. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ruidp","2006-06-08T18:26:13Z","very good","This tiny turbos series is very good in all aspects. The cars are very detailed for the size, good lego pieces, lots of special pieces, great wheels, cheap price, great boxes for storage of the cars(lego should improve their boxes).
I have all four tiny turbos of 2006 and I wish I could get the all the others...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The car itself is quite nice - though a bit simple, perhaps. But take it apart and there are so many useful bits - 8 1x3curved slopes, 6 yellow cheesers, and a bunch of brackets, clips and tiles.

It is totaly worthless. Wait till 2008 and buy the mini ferraris, they look good. Now all we need is Aston Martins.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2007-10-29T21:46:45.81Z","Nice Set Highlighted by Great Parts!","Tuner X is a really nice example of the potential that the Tiny Turbos line has to offer LEGO fans. This model was done over in the Tuner Garage in a Lime color scheme which it looks better in. The stickers included with this set are an ugly magenta color and there are too many of the stickers. There are awesome parts to build with however. The 8 black sloped bricks that make up the windshield are terrific as are the cheese pieces seen at the front bumper. The rear spoiler is made up of a great piece that I haven't seen on other Racers before this model. This set was the inspiration for my Go-Karts pictured in my brickshelf gallery. I bought a few of these sets and wondered what I could do with them besides the main model. I added a few pieces from my inventory and created my Tiny Turbos Go-Karts. Check them out at:

"hustla187","2008-08-08T10:27:36.39Z","Good for Tuner Fans","This is a really nice tuner and reminds me of a modified Honda or Toyota. The yellow pieces are very cool and the purple graphics are nice too. The stickers are annoying, but detailed when finished. It isn't bad at all.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-27T12:02:07.297Z","Great Tuner","This set is a tiny turbo from 2006, is cool to play with, is useful, and have a good design. Why rate it low? This have some different things on the building, and the details are cool and looks like with tunned cars. One of the different things on the building is the back spoiler, under it is placed a piece from a 05'set (placed under the front of the &quot;street maniac&quot; set), and the turbo on the front, don't very hided or very showed, good positioned to don't dismantles or to run well. The colors are great, like the black glass and the yellow, with some purple details, like the flames. The glass part is well made with ramp pieces, good connected, to the front and the back. The parts on the front are good positioned, having places to the turbo, wheels, and the part under the front. This is a good set, that makes that this have to do, being useful, playable, and with good(and easy) building, being recommended for fans of cars and lego.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rifraphy","2008-11-21T05:20:12.077Z","Overtuned yellow Tiny Turbo","This is not my first Tiny Turbo, but the one that started the whole FOTT. (Freak Of Tiny Turbos). Ok, lame. But the car isn't. This little yellow one has a lot of pink and purple stickers, giving it a sinister, fast look. Here are the pros and cons:

:: Stickers look quite nice for a yellow-purple combo. 
:: Rare pieces, ex. Spoiler, chrome, slopes, and rims. 
:: The Tiny Turbo with the most parts ever in history! 66 pcs. 
   
;; A bit big for a tuner.
;; Stickers are a pain in the neck to stick on. 

Overall, a very good TT. I reccommend it, as it has lots of pieces for a Tiny Turbo! Very good-looking too - and cute, once finished. Fun to build, but pricey. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cityboy518ipswich","2011-02-22T13:30:01.453Z","Darn Stickers!","<p>This was my first tiny turbo, and after this i got flame glider, power cruiser and tuner garage.</p>
<h4>The Price:</h4>
<p>I got this for £2.99 in 2006 which is a good price for a TT. Becasue of the VAT increase it would now be £3.99.</p>
<h4>The Build:</h4>
<p>A pretty quick build, didn't take me long, but the stickers go over so many bricks! I've lost them over time and now it's just a bare yellow car with the side and spoiler stickers remaining.</p>
<h4>The Overall Model:</h4>
<p>A nice tiny turbo, well worth picking up and goes well with the tuner garage and other TT garages. I give it a 4/5.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"tkettle9719","2012-01-05T08:12:20.93Z","Yellow Racing Car of Greatness!","<p>I got this set for half price at Toys 'R Us, 2 dollars. I like this set, as it was one of my first System sets that I ever got, and the colors were great.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The wheels are a basic detail, but they look so cool.<br></li><li>-The parts here are used excellently, and there's so many fr the price that I payed. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The amount of stickers in this small set should be considered illegal. <br></li><li>-This has a horrible red, violet, or pink color combo which, while it looks nice on the car, is a bit shameful-looking.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is quite excellent for the final product, and is excellent at the price that I got it at. I recommend it, but only if you don't have any other Tiny Turbos.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
