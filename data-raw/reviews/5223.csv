<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Clearly describes what you get, what the individual sets do &amp; advertises for the second movie. Instructions are clear &amp; in very good condition. Having only just bee opened after 10 years.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice selection, mostly parts ive already gotten before now, as ide from Vohtarak&#39;s pincers, head &amp; the Visorak torso piece. From Sidorak the new parts were the Matoran torso piece, large cogs, 2 pieces from his herding blade, socket connectors, Toa Metru feet&nbsp;&amp; a few others. So in total i got 13 new pieces, which includes the mask!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is Bionicle! Come On! there are no minifigures in Bionicle! Well actually there is &amp; they start in the same year this value pack was released! 2005!&nbsp;However there are&nbsp;none in this pack (even thought they should be called mini-statues).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Vohtarak: Same as all Visorak, the same build. But a nice one, very strait forward but enjoyable. Like all Visorak, same features &amp; a bit gappy, but i really don&#39;t mind. I&#39;ve been looking forward to&nbsp;owning a&nbsp;Visorak for so many years, im certainly not disappointed with Vohtarak!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sidorak: My 1st original titan ever, &amp; what a great build! With the layered &amp; complex torso, lower legs &amp; feet followed by the lower arms all great. the lower legs&nbsp;&amp; upper arms were only simple but they serve their purpose.&nbsp;Build wise the the Head is so freaking weird!&nbsp;I mean the use of the Toa Metru head is quite miss used, they could have tried to use or make something different piece. Playability wise, its quite good, with the 2 main features, however the most annoying part of this figure is the very loose left arm! I&#39;ve been trying to tighten it up but no luck! Which just makes the left arm completely unable to pose!. Good thing the right works, cause its light enough to move &amp; pose without spinning around. Other that that a nice titan, Get Sidorak if you can (unless you already have him!).</p>

<p>The Mask: only a simple foam mast, when i got it out of the box it was horribly out of shape, but getting better, certainly nice as a bonus good as a collectors piece (&amp; maybe for cosplay!).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Both Vohtarak &amp; Sidorak are very nice looking, certainly nice to get one of each 10 years+ after their release, &amp; the Vakama mask is nice to. Couple nice play features for both. Aside from the problem&nbsp;with Sidorak&#39;s left arm, this is a really nice collection.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A worth wile collection to get, however depending on where you live &amp; what site you buy if off, it can&nbsp;be expensive (postage included). So be mindful if you find it online. Price aside, this collection is good for fans young &amp; old (or those young @ heart!).</p>
