"BludChylde1","2006-10-12T15:03:39Z","Nice set and bigger than expected","Paid roughly $45 Canadian for this set (after taxes). Not a bad price considering the size of the boat. I agree with the comment by Mogenson, the hull was definitely larger than expected.

Decent design and layout fo the boat interior. It would have been nice to include another police minifig, but it is a minor nitpick.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-03-05T08:03:03.997Z","Harking back to the golden age of Lego Boats","My first review with the new system which, I must say, is really better than the last!

Anyway, this is a wonderful set that looks credible but is a whole lot of fun to play with, harking back to the golden age of Lego boats: able to float, complete with fun details and a motor! The motor is really quite strong. I like the various compartments for police business, and the stark little prison cell for the prisoner. I also like how the plates can be removed to reveal the interior of those compartments. Quite a number of fancy trans-black parts are included. The helicopter is a nice bonus, but is rather skimpy. However, the set as a package is an excellent addition to the City line.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-03-31T05:51:16.347Z","not perfect, but quite good!","i only got this set because it was on sale, and because i like boats. i like how it is built mainly with standard bricks and slopes, it resembles the bots from the 90s, i enjoyed building it a lot.
the disadvantage is the extraordinary length: it may be cool in real water (haven't tried it yet), but in a lego town it is just too big.
perhaps its possible to turn it into a freighter, i should give it a shot.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T01:17:18.123Z","Nice addition to my ever growing Police force","Santa brougt me this set in '06 and it wasn't even on my list. I like it but have yet to try it in the water yet. Would be really good to own if you had a pond or pool nearby to play in. Good Set-hey its one of the new City sets and its the best thing that LEGO has done right in years - Solid set and solid value. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vhtf_hw_lego","2007-05-04T06:30:50.06Z","Hooked Back to Lego!","I got this set because it was from Lego Power Items. Sales pricing at 50% discount. Lego are smart to have power items discounts thus had made me hooked! I had stopped collecting Lego since 14 and 12 years down the road, 26 now and still acting like a child! 

I had reconfigured the jail house to miserly fitted 3 prisoners in there! Make them do time for their work. Added some holding stands to holding up the guns from Lego 7655 (Starwars Clone Troopers Battle Pack). Remake the helicopter into a slightly bigger. 

Too bad this doesn’t comes with light &amp; sound like the Lego #6483.

"Legowarroir","2007-10-11T07:46:40.077Z","The best yet!","This is the best police boat ever. It has a jail at the bottom and another room for equipment. You have to lift the top to get into those rooms. It comes with a little jet so you can try your boat in the water. But I didn't try it yet. It took about 30 minutes for me to make this. The helicopter is awsome. Overall it is a awsome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-01-28T20:36:36.967Z","Good Set ","I like the idea of Lego bringing back the police boat. The design is nice and fun to play with. The helicopter reminds me of past helicopters that look like that which is great that Lego thought of that. However, the stickers are really annoying as always. Still, this set is pretty good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2007-12-16T20:41:57.123Z","Great Comeback!","I saw this set at TRU in July and bought it. It did not disappoint. The set is amazing, inside and out, and looks very classic. Barely any juniorization, and neat little helicopter indeed. I also like the piece that holds the trans yellow, trans green, and trans red 1x1 circulars, especially since this is a classic part. I like the prison and the control room. Plus the price is right, especially opposed to the 2007 fire boat.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-03-01T09:32:28.14Z","GREAT PRICE, GREAT MINIFIGS, GREAT FUNCTIONS, GREAT SET!","This set is amazing!
The boat is a police boat, with three minifigs- Robber, Helicopter man and sailor, who has a life jacket. The boat has three 
parts- the cockpit on top, the rooms below (more on that later) and the helicopter pad.
The rooms below are superb- there is room to fit about 13 minifigs in there, with the division removed and a bed taken out. 
13 MINIFIGS! This can be good for army buillders needing transport for their troops. There is also a box down here, which 
opens to reveal a space where a walkie talkie can be stored. You have to take the cockpit and roof off to reveal this area, 
but thats not even a hint of a CON. One of the very few downsides is that the door at the back of the room does not open- 
sad, Lego went to the trouble of putting a doorknob on the door. 
Behind the underneath area, outside, is the Helicopter pad. Nothing wrong with this. The helicopter stays on well (from what 
i can remember).I love this area, as you can fit so many minifigs on it! I managed to get the prisoner transport from the 
World City police station to fit in this area, along with a much smaller vehichle and 5 minifigs. (8 minifigs in total). You 
could even put the angler from the Aqua Raider set Angler Ambush here instead, if you wanted to!
The front is sweet. It can fit even more minifigs, at least 6. I put 3 minifigs on it, and then the minisub from AquaRaiders 
set Angler Ambush behind them. Its fits well, no cramped minifigs. However, this is all once the search light is taken off 
(and put a bit further behind, on the roof of the room below. Hurray!).Not much more to say here.
And finally, the cockpit. 2 seats, one computer, a spinning rader thingy in front, easy removal to view rooms below... its 
wonderful. 3 minifigs fit up here, one standing behind the seats. Behind this is the wing thing, with a siren. The wing bends 
a bit in the middle, but no big problem. Barely even a minor CON. The wing is easy to modify. You could even put a few more 
minifigs there!
The floating function works well, though its quite hard to dry the interior of the boat. I reccomend a powerful hairdryer! 
The motor is fun to use on the boat, though it could be more powerful. But theres a limit.. its only a lego set! The motor 
also doubles as a huge missile! Another good thing for army builders.
The helicopter is pretty small. Fits one minifig. Again, its not very big, but its not meant to be a huge city one, more of a 
tranport off the boat. Propellor spins, and front of cockpit opens up.                      
!WARNING! INCLUDES STICKERS!
Overall, a fantastic set. The few cons are minor, and easy to modify(with the right pieces). BUY IT NOW! Ooops, i forgot, you 
CAN'T! ITS NO LONGER AVAILABLE!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-07-30T10:40:52.733Z","Great Lego Boat","I think that the default settings for the boat is already 5 stars, but being the guy that is always making room for improvements, I subsequently modified it hours after buying and assembling it according to original instructions. I raised the helipad at the back of the boat, to create space for a police car below the helipad. I also demolished the whole jail idea, replacing it with a control room and a cargo hold for a small police motorbike at the most front area. Amazing what you can do with a little tweaking? The Verdict: BUY THE SET. It's the most worth it set out there right now. Just the right price, the right parts, the right stuff.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-09-11T12:47:35.077Z","you don't need the motor to have fun","This set is fun with the motor, but for those who like to display, this set is also good without the motor.

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-31T16:07:00.56Z","High Performance Police Boat…","Another eBay set, this was an ex-display set from a Toys ‘R’ Us shop!  So I got hold of it in mint condition but minus the box and instructions.   It arrived as a heap of bricks in a shoe box and after downloading the building instructions from the internet it soon became a police boat, and what an impressive piece it is!

The boat features many different areas, firstly the exterior consists of a long, dark black hull with associated graphics and a white superstructure black high-gain VHF antennae and various pieces of GPS / communication devices.

The interior, starting from the bow, features a control centre which is housed in the hull just aft of the forepeak, and this area accommodates a safe storage area for tools, equipment etc.   Also in this area is a desk with a piece of electronic equipment.   To the rear of this area is a cell which can accommodate just one minifig prisoner who is provided with a bunk which is secured behind a cell door.   On the sides of the superstructure, slim tinted glass panels provide a view to the outside world.   At the rear of the cabin area, there is a large aft cockpit complete with handrails and a heli-pad.

The flybridge area is quite basic and features two captain’s chairs and a single control panel and steering wheel positioned behind dark tinted windshields.

The exterior of the boat, starting from the bow features a forepeak mounted heavy duty searchlight which can swivel 360º and comes complete with a handle for ease of operation.   There are also two handrails mounted on the side decks complete with handheld searchlights.   The traditional radar is mounted on the coach roof and it too swivels 360º.   Also in this area are blue ‘lights’ and more decals on the flybridge sides.   A handheld VHF radio and marker paddle are mounted on a bracket just forward of the fins which extend upwards to the white radar arch which is decorated with burgee mast complete with port / starboard and anchor lights.   There are also two high gain VHF radio aerials along with more blue ‘lights’ and what appears to be a CCTV system.

The helicopter can be stored securely on the aft deck heli-pad and is small in design but serves its purpose well.

Another great set, which also features three minifigs and the famous underwater motor system which can propel the boat along at speed, and with a slight adjustment can also steer the boat to either port or starboard.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LEGOwikiguy","2010-01-16T12:20:05.53Z","The criminal escapes!","Wow, my first set. Memories...anyways, I remember buying this set back in 06 maybe, took it apart some years ago. Though this is an amazing set for the original price. Here are some pros/cons to summarize this set:

Pros:
1. Boat floats
2. A working motor, which can be helpful and fun during the summer
3. great design and details inside. If you like LEGO City Police sets, you'll like this
4. Minifigures included let you make the story, whether the crook escapes or is recaptured

Cons: 
1. Almost all sets have cons. This set is not good for a first set if you want to build the entire thing, especially for younger kids when working on the interior. A parent should help.
2. In my opinion, the helicopter just shouldn't be included. Pretty small, too open, and is crammed in the back as a little extra with the set.

Summary:
If you want a good set for your police collection, and like boats (Like myself), then this is the set for you! It is also very good with playability! 4.5/5 is what I say.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
