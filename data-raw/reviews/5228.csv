What you get is ten zamor spheres in three diffrent cool coulours and its a handy set if your short of zamors or else you just collect them.Oh and one last thing these are not marbles these are zamor spheres.

"bmwlego","2007-10-31T18:44:09.327Z","Cheap Bionicle Accessory Set","I bought this set even though I don't care for the Bionicle line of toys. I bought it knowing that one day I would come up with an idea for using these in a town setting. As of now, I plan on using them as cargo in the back of a dump truck on its way from a work site. If you have any other ideas for this set (and not using them for a Bionicle display) please let me know.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-06-22T22:41:37.67Z","Great Accessory","Well, this is an ammo pack for your zamor launcher/midak skyblaster. However, I use it instead as an ammo for my exo-force MOC. Cheap set, and a must-buy if you think the zamors are loosing easily.

"Gus_263","2009-05-29T15:25:40.077Z","Very Useful","I don't rate collectibles (like spinners and disks) as 5/5 many times, but this, for now, is the best collectible (for Bionicle and even for other themes). It is very useful in many ways including Lego sets/creations. The spheres included in this pack include metallic colors, differently of the Piraka/Inika's spheres, that are commonly found in green, blue and yellow, and hardly found with red and dark green colours. 

Different of what some people think, there are many ways to use it. Firstly, as an ammo for Bionicle figures (obviously), they are compatible with Thornax launchers, Midak Skyblasters, and the Zamor sphere launchers. But there are also other uses. 

In a Castle set, as examples 7029 and 7041, it might be very good as ammo for catapults (though they look like way more cannonballs). And they are even used in Mars Mission sets (both them and their launchers). The Zamor Sphere Launchers might look very huge for normal vehicles, but as some of the MM's (and also Exo-Force) vehicles/machines are big, they become applicable. 

And plus, they can be used as cargo for some City sets (trucks, trains and more), as they are not that heavy to dismantle them. And it still not confirmed, but the next version of Mindstorm sets (Nxt 2.0) might include some of those ammos. I'm not a specialist with Mindstorms, but there are ways to make a mindstorms NXT shoot Zamor Spheres (you might search for videos in youtube). They are used even for some GBC (Great Ball Contraption) Modules, and they do great results with it!

Knowing the many ways they can be used, there isn't how rate it less than five. It is the best of the Bionicle Collectibles, and would be very useful get sets like this one. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pirakapro","2009-05-24T11:35:31.78Z","good","     This set is good because if you live in a house with heavy sofas or if you play with your bionicles outside then chances are you've lost one or two of these. If only they made these in green or blue To mach the lost balls. I don't use theas much cause they don't match the missing balls. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-15T08:36:45.297Z","I bought two","These Zamors are a nice addition to any 2006 collection!  They're even more fun because they come in different colors (gold, black, and silver), so you can assign different powers to each color (kinda like the protodermis Zamors for the Inika and the antidermis Zamors for the Piraka).  Altogether a nice set, especially if you're someone who needs more ammo. 

Pros:

-Different colored Zamors

-Ten of 'em

-Great ammo stocker-upper

Cons:

-It would have been nice to come with a small Zamor launcher...

All in all, I rate it a 4/5 because it is only good if you have a 2006/2007/2008 Bionicle that shoots a Zamor, like the Hydruka or the Phantoka (silver Zamors come in handy for that, let me tell you).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
