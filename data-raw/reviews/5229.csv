"st_pete305","2006-04-23T15:15:08Z","Useful","I have purchased a total of (8) of this set. Lego has scaled up the door size to 6 brick unit wide and 6 brick units tall. Like other &quot;Designer Sets&quot;, the set does not come with any mini-figures. 

Overall, this set is very useful if you are a fan of the Town/City collection.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"omgbrick","2007-08-05T23:05:11.973Z","Too many doors and windows!","I found this and thought that it would be a good set to get some pieces but was disapointed to find tat there were 10 door frames and ten windows what kind of house has ten doors. Another bad thing about it is that it doesn't have instructios too build homes. Now onto the positives it does have two bushs and two evergreen trees which are great for putting in yard s looks of roofing tiles and some base plates along with lots of white pieces. A minifig and some pices for the interor would also be nice for the set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"bsmarthen","2007-06-04T17:25:11.92Z","ok but not great","This is an ok set. Nothing really stands out with this. The windows and doors are kind of cartoonish. You get some nice pieces in here but not much. Its good just for parts you really cant build a good model with just this one set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
