I was on a vacation in Europe for two months, and the only toys I had were a few toy cars. I was enthralled by this set and never got tired of it after months of use. If it wasn't for this set, I probably would never had gotten into these awesome interactive block. Now for more of a review. This set comes with about 256 parts (I think). There are mostly just standerd bricks, &nbsp;but does come with a minifigure. This set is well worth the cost, and is great for people who are just stating out.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
