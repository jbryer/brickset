The only downside was the stickers which didn't last long, but the design itself was very cool given the relatively limited type of pieces back then.

It is great to have this set for many years! The only thing that can be a problem is that the stickers keep on falling off, even with glue. But do try to grab this set sometime because it is good for beginners and collectors!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
