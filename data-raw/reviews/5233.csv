<p>The Crime headlight/ grill piece is a cool detail that we don&#39;t get much of today. The wind shield is closed off in the back, so it would be hard to use with modern minifigures.The tipper piece is uncommon, only coming out in 6 sets. 5 in blue and 1 in yellow. It is just placed on the back of the truck and can fall off easily, but the tipping feature works well. The front tires are are single tires while the wo rear tires have a grove down the middle to give them a look like they have two tires on each wheel, like real life vehicles.</p>

<p>Overall, I love this set. It is a great reminder of what LEGO sets used to be like and how much they have improved, but I do miss how the chrome details and the rear wheels make it more like a real vehicle.</p>
