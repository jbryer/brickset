"TheBigGuy","2007-02-04T23:47:36.753Z","Good Set","This isi another of from the very impressive sets in the construction range.  I would rate it good but not quite great.  The trailer is fragile and won't sit right on mine.   But other wise this set is fine.  The detail on the main part of the truck is superb.  Also its easy and fun to build.  I give it a satisfactory 8 out of 10 ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2007-02-17T15:10:54.827Z","Fantastic truck with HUGE bridge on trailer","First off, this kit is truly massive when built, and the vehicle itself is solidly put together.  Unfortunately, the size and shape of the bridge makes it quite fragile and akward when the whole kit is assembled.  I would have prefered a solid trailer with the bridge resting and secured on top of it, as opposed to just being supported by the wheel devices at the ends.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

1st: +++++ Double seats for the front cab. Most Lego vehicles are a single seater. 
2nd: ++++ It fits the Lego 7248 Digger during the low bed configuration. 
3rd: +++++ Pricing. We bought this set at SGD 29.90 (USD 19.93). 
4th: ++++ Size of it. 
5th: +++ Stickers with special transport. 
6th: +++++ Details of the Front Cab. 
8th: ++++ Fire extinguisher. Suits the vehicle well.
7th: +++++ A must to have for Lego City Construction Collectors! 

Dislikes: 
1st: --- The bridge. I would rather it to be a low bed trailer without the gap during low bed configuration. If that it originally to be a low bed trailer, there must be a ramp for the Digger to load on the low bed. Since it is a Heavy Loader with bridge, the front &amp; the rear trailer should be connected directly instead of using the bridge to connect them. The bridge should be just resting on my suggested configuration. 
If you happen to own the Lego 7249 XXL Mobile Crane or Lego 7905 Building Crane, during play time, how do you lift the bridge to the crane hook without the front &amp; rear section of the trailer to be intact to suit the theme of loading/unloading play. 
2nd: --- Stickers again, why can't be printed parts.

We have 1 too!

1. the whole design of a bridge cargo holding the two sections is kindoff impractical. They should of made a flat trailer.

2. For such a big set, they stick 1 fig in it!

3. there isnt alot off accesoreis",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-06-27T12:06:43.623Z","split this set into 2 and it is perfect!","this set is imperfect on its own. there is nothing in the middle to support the bridge! 

often you find sets that lack certain details and you wish they could add a few more things to it. on the contrary, this set is perfect if you split it up into 2 complete components: truck and bridge. yes, now your town has a solid bridge, and the 2-seater truck is huge and looks awesome on its own!

i used the entire trailer portion (including the 3 pairs of wheels) to create a giant beach dune buggy with a few extra bricks here and there.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omnius","2019-03-23T22:00:27.513Z","Possibly the biggest City vehicle ever!","<p>Easily the most striking aspect of this set is the sheer size&nbsp;of it! The trailer bed is built on a pair of 8 x 16 tiles, making it 32 studs long. Combined with the girder frames on either side, this makes for a visually imposing vehicle. The trailer can be rebuilt as a longer low-loader. The rear bogie is separated from the trailer bed by a turntable, allowing for independent steering (similar real-world vehicles are steered remotely by someone on foot during tricky turns). The cab is the most complex part of the build, as the trailer is built around a handful of unusually large pieces.</p>

<p>Away from the trailer, the cab is an impressive size, being 8 studs wide instead of the 6 we&#39;ve come to expect from Lego&#39;s Great Vehicles. Money-wise, it goes without saying that you&#39;re getting a very big vehicle that - amazingly - retailed for just &pound;14.99! Even in 2006 that was an absolute bargain. While it fetches more on the secondary market, it&#39;s well worth picking up. You may consider investing in a couple of police bikes to escort it around your city!</p>

Almost perfect.","I read the reviews for this, saw many pics of it and looked for a long time to find one in Taiwan. &nbsp;Not an easy task, but one showed up and it came home with me.<div><br></div><div>First off - this tractor of this truck is 8 lugs wide. &nbsp;If you have narrow city streets, you may want to consider a couple of flag cars to accompany the set. &nbsp;Fortunately, I have the Wind Turbine Transporter (7747) and it has a great little flag truck I can use.</div><div><br></div><div>Second - the bridge is 10 lugs wide! &nbsp;It won't be going down my city streets very often. &nbsp;The scale seems huge compared to most other 6-lug wide trucks in the City collection, but it works fine when you actually connect the incredibly long trailer.</div><div><br></div><div>The realism can be excellent using the elements provided, but the instructions should be modified a bit. &nbsp;If the instructions are followed, the bridge section is really tall. &nbsp;In real life, this would actually be too tall to ever see on the road. &nbsp;Simply flipping the angle arms over on the trailer halves, you can lower the bridge by a bunch! &nbsp;Of course, this means your trailer will now be much longer, as well. &nbsp;In this modified configuration, it more closely resembles the incredibly long loads seen on US highways. &nbsp;The separate dolly axles supporting one end of the bridge is just like the real thing (only electric and pneumatic cables and hoses are connecting the two ends). &nbsp;This allows the trailer length to be configured as needed.</div><div><br></div><div>the build was pretty good with a nice mix of Technic components and standard ones. &nbsp;The side-view mirrors are great and the over-the-road lighting is excellent! &nbsp;It reminds me of my Technic Crane Truck.Other reviewers wrote that the trailer is fragile. &nbsp;I haven't seen that yet. &nbsp;The Technic pins hold things together pretty well. &nbsp;Time will tell with a 5yo and 3yo loose in my city.</div><div><br></div><div>I actually desired this set for the bridge. &nbsp;I have a lot of trucks in my city, so another wasn't needed. &nbsp;I also have a lot of trains in my city and the bridge works just fine for the 8-lug wide tracks. &nbsp;I don't have the big excavator yet (trying to find one here), so using the trailer in the low-boy configuration hasn't been done yet.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions leave a little to be desired, but it didn't take long to figure things out. &nbsp;The Technic pins on the trailer ends are depicted as pushed all the way in before the bridge is put on top. &nbsp;The pins actually push into the side of the bridge, so they should be illustrated as pushed halfway in. &nbsp;A couple of steps showing the conversion to a low-boy would have been nice. &nbsp;Fortunately, the ads in the back of the booklet have a small picture of it hauling the excavator, so I reverse-engineered it.</div><div><br></div><div>This really is a great set to add massive scale to your construction theme. &nbsp;Don't get it just to add to your city, get it to add to your construction theme. &nbsp;It really works well with the other construction sets. &nbsp;Find it if you can - you won't be disappointed.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"HaulingBricks","2023-04-12T13:17:56.893Z","Heavy Loader 7900 Review","<p>Heavy Loader 7900 suffers from a strange phenomenon where it looks cooler than it actually is.</p>

<p>The building experience is a bit weak - the truck is not bad to assembly but is one of the goofy 8-wide trucks from this era.&nbsp; The bridge and dolly are both fragile and don&#39;t want to stay together.</p>

<p>The part usage is unique - the truck and dolly are not too exciting, but this is the only set than comes with the large 13 x 13 frame element in Light Bluish Gray/ Medium Stone Grey. That gives it a little bit of a boost.</p>

<p>Playability is not fun.&nbsp; The bridge&nbsp;is constantly separating from the dolly or the fifth wheel.&nbsp; It is just an oversized model that is awkward and fragile.&nbsp; There isn&#39;t much active play with this model, this is definitely a park and display set.</p>

<p>I thought it was a bit overpriced for what I got, especially having to buy it from the secondary market nowadays.&nbsp; I do like the set and am glad it is in my collection, but I&#39;m not dragging it out to set it up anytime.</p>
