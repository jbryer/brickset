"erik_leppen","2007-11-13T17:00:16.06Z","Strong construction","This set is one of the few non-technic recent sets I own, and I'm quite happy with it. Here a few positive and negative remarks.

First the positive.
There are lots of useful parts in yellow and also a few in dark-gray which I think is a nice color in combination with yellow. It also has quite a lot of technic parts (long beams mainly) so if you are looking for a set with such parts, consider this one. My favorite technic parts in this set are the 16L bars with two holes and the bricks with axle holes.
Secondly, the crane is very strong.
Thirdly, it has a high playability value I think, due to the several side items that come with it (the toilet and, building shed and the signs and fences) and it contains three minifigs.
Lastly, it has also actual functionality, as there is a winch added to raise and lower the hook with a string. I think this is a really good thing for non-technic people to get in contact with something actually functional.

A downside however.
The tower is constructed so strong that it takes quite much effort to take it apart - imagining this is meant for, like, 11-year olds I can easily imagine that quite a few of them have trouble disassembling the tower.
Also, as Technic person I am used to having an alternative model, I would have liked a non-technic set having one, but this is not that much of a problem, I am just mentioning it.

A few other remarks. The hook is attached to the crane with two #1 technic angle connectors, that could be pulled out. However I don't see this as a problem, as it prevents kids from overloading the crane and thereby possibly damaging Lego parts. Also I like how the hook is attached as I can use the string for other purposes, for it is not attached to the hook.

I think overall this is a good set of Lego. I'm bad at giving maximum ratings, but it easily deserves a 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LEGOmyeggo","2007-12-19T16:50:13.437Z","NICE.","This is a nice addition to my lego model of New York City located outside Akron, Ohio. It holds a lot and it is sturdy. Good amount of yellow bricks. The three construction workers are cool, too. The caution signs are useful, as were the tools. The blue John is funny! It is so weird that they included that in this set, but I like it. The control tower and ladder on the crane are a nice touch. I like that you can also move the top.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Doctor_Sinister","2007-08-15T18:09:05.69Z","Great!","This crane now towers above Tabletown - it's so massive, I love it.  It's super-sturdy and very nice to look at.  The two little structures that come with it are a lovely touch.

No issues other than to comment that the box-girder sections are actually different pieces to those pictured on the box and in the manual - kind of weird, but I'm not fussed.

oh yeah it has some little buildings too. one of them is like an administration building and the other is an outhouse with a lego toilet.

"petro17sq","2008-02-16T13:44:02.607Z","Excelent Engeeniering work","I just finished building this set for the second time and it is amazing, it is a good work of engineering, the construction of the main tower is impressive and the use of technic pieces to give some strange to the tower is great.
The detail in the office and the toilets are nice&#161;
Like usual I will like more minifigures, I have all the constructions sets of the City series and I will love more orange minifigures to have a complete crew of workers and Engineers for my site.  

Overall Excellent

"hustla187","2008-09-06T20:10:54.56Z","Look Out Below!","Lego nailed this set perfectly and what most Lego fans expected. The crane is amazing and also mindblowing. There is a port-a-potty which is a first for Lego for bathrooms. There are two minifigs in this set which makes this set much better and has absolutely no flaws. This is a set that will stand the test of time. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2009-01-10T20:11:29.42Z","Impressive, but not perfect","This is certainly an eye-catching model in my Lego city.  As other reviewers have stated, it is very sturdy and functions well as a building crane.  However, I was hoping that there might be more mechanical functionality other than the one crank to raise and lower the hook.  It would have been nice to have a system that moved the trolley forward and back on the arm and another to rotate the arm.  However, perhaps those features would be more suitable on a Technic set rather than a City set.  Despite having to manually position the trolley and arm, the set works very well.  My only complaints are:

1 - The rubber sections on which the trolley rests are flexed to give the trolley its A-shape, and I'm sure that after some years have passed the rubber will not age well and this model will be impossible to build without modifications.  

2 - The geometry of the arm supports seems a little off.  The rear of the arm is bent slightly upward once everything is in place.

Other than these two flaws, I am extremely impressed with the Building Crane.  The buildings are a nice touch, especially the port-o-potty - complete with paper roll :)  There are also a lot of useful pieces in this set, and there is very little in the way of extra-large pieces.

In all, I am glad I bought this set.  It will come in handy for the next expansion to my Lego City.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BigMac","2009-11-27T17:10:20.547Z","Awesome. The Best City Construction. The best Lego Crane. Perfect","I have a lot of lego cranes, especially technic crane trucks like 8421, 8462, 8285 & 8460 etc. Technically or functionwise and as a City series, 7905 has no shame at all when comparing with these expensive and complicate technic models. No matter you as a technic fans or city fans this is definitely a ""must have"".

Pros.

1. It is very large, probabaly the tallest Lego set. It is about 600 mm tall and  length of the horisonal crane truss  is more than 600mm in length.

2. Very strong design. You would expect with its height and length, the tower crane will sway to a significant extend when being played with, but I can tell you here - it is much stronger than you thought.

3. Anesthetically, it is unbeatable, good colour & good protion looks like a real one. When I first put this up, I thought the cantilever support to the ballast weight at the back is too delicate. Proportionally, it just looks too thin or weak to support the heavy ballast. However, one day when I drove by a building site, the crane there was almost exactly the same as 7905,  of course, all my query about the scale of this support was just unfound.

4. Enjoyment of building, it is not simple but actually quite challenging. Certainly, it will give you heaps of ""job"" satisfaction. As I gradually assembled the parts, I admired the talent of the designer, as the way how the vertical tower was strengthen or locked up through the middle void of the vertical tower. The horizonal truss had a lot engineering input to make a real truss structure.

5.  Other details of the design is another great merit added to this set. The crane control cabin, the platform out side the cabin, the ladder, the platform at ground level, the toilet , site office and road barricade are all thoughtful design and they are all awesome!!

6. As a technic fan, I would not miss the chance to modify this one, does not mean this set is not good enough, I have to stress here again this set is perfect. My modification is to use the pnuematic crane part of 8460 to replace the horizontal trussed arm of 7905. It required some thinking and a bit try & error. I am quite sure this is now the tallest Lego crane ever since it measure 980mm tall, when the pneumatic cyclinders are fully extended, and a turning/ swaying diameter of over 800 mm. I also add an air tank to facilitate the operation of this pneumatic crane. With this huge size, the crane is still very strong, thanks to the sturdy built of the vertcal tower of 7905.

Cons.

If this is not a toy there will be heaps to be complaint. As a toy, what can you ask for ? Yes, the spcae to display the models, its a real headache to me as I don't want to take them down, one original model and a modified model, where to hide them.

Conclusion.

Finally, at the time when I post this, it has a ratinng of only 4.6. It is really too low especially compare with those starwar models ( check the rating of 7671 to 7679, I have all of them, except 7676 only),  one or two of these are good but not all, however, they are all having a high rating. Compare with their rating this one worth a 6 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jsosse","2009-05-28T22:58:03.36Z","Huge","It was this set that got me into collecting Lego all over again, now as an adult fan.

It is really huge and it is awesome how alike the real thing this crane is. It even got me dreaming of putting together a proportional building frame, just to install this at the top!

I agree with some of the reviewers that think this set could have more options for powering its movements.

Anyway, it is a must have to anyone interested in putting together a whole construction collection. And, for those (like me) that would like it to tower even further the construction site, I recommend getting a second set and combining both. Just make sure to increase its base plate area to stabilize it...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"thohan","2011-01-08T14:06:59.047Z","An epic build, fun and functional","<p>What a terrific set, if you can find it, that is! I bought this on 
Amazon and it cost around $120 USD if I recall correctly, it's been 
nearly three years ago. If you love the building process, you'll really 
love this set. The main instruction manual (not counting the separate one 
for the ""portaloo"") contains 84 pages! The end product is a very 
functional, working crane, brilliantly designed, it even comes with a special 
counterweight LEGO piece! Forgive me if I exceed my quota of 
explanation points.<br><br>The crane stands tall, and it is quite stable
 if placed on a hard (non-carpet) surface, or if on carpet, just put a 
book under the base and you're golden.<br><br>Here's a shout-out to 
brickset.com for having links to the PDF versions of the instruction 
manuals. The original manuals, placed in my son's care, got destroyed by his 
well-meaning but highly-destructive little sisters. My son and I are slowly putting 
this wonderful set back together, searching for all the LEGO pieces as 
they have been scattered amongst the other bricks from the two-dozen or 
so other sets my son has collected over the years. We love you, 
brickset.com!<br><br>I think I can earnestly say that this is a 
""must-have"" set, especially if you are a big fan of the LEGO City 
series. Save your LEGO allowance up and you will be rewarded! Keep on bricking!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
