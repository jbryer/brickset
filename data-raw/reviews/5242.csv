One of the most important memory from my chilhood is to build the mill from the cover with my dad (there was no plans in the set). This set predestinated me: from the moment when I unpacked this fantastic christmas gift (1980), I wanted to play with Lego. Nothing else. Nowadays, I am waiting for my child to bor and grow up: I want to play LEGO.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"medleyj","2020-04-30T19:40:10.233Z","oldest set I own with so many unique hard ot find pieces","<p>This is my oldest set that I remember my parents getting me. Not my first set, but my oldest. The power functions with the large yellow battery and black battery box/controller were a great addition to Lego at the time. Ideas for a windmill or some structure with a motorized element made my early lego city have a higher playability factor. The 3 old style first gen mini figs are a good addition as well as the excavator spring loaded bucket, the larger winch for string to wind up for the bucket or red hooks allowed for larger structures to be made with a longer string to reach the ground. The larger red loader arms to create a dozer or high lift loader are very hard to find in sets. The tracks for a dozer, tank, or cargo haulers are the icing on the cake. I wish lego would bring back this track style design that are way more durable than the rubber ones that dry rot after 20+ years. The&nbsp; tracks didn&#39;t do well on tile or hard floor surfaces, but on carpet, it&#39;s ideal for movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rare and hard to find pieces include the large wind up yellow winch, red crane hooks, excavator crane spring loaded bucked, black tank or dozer treads, 4 red gears made for the tracks to rotate, the yellow motor and black battery gear box, older smaller red windows and door, grey ball joint attachment as well as several other special pieces not found in very many sets.&nbsp;</p>

I loved it then and&nbsp;still have all the parts and the instruction book in my Lego collection (Lego is the only type of childhood toy I kept as I aged into adolescence and then adulthood). Looking at the parts, the manual, and images of the box online brings back great memories of a set that was quite advanced for its time.</p>

<p>Posting this review mainly just to document that a later production version of this set - which is the version I have - included black versions of the 3707 and 3708 Technic axles (instead of milky white), and a left-facing version of the red tow hook (3127) instead of the right-facing version (3127b).</p>
