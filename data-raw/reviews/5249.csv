"pfccypret","2006-11-15T00:56:29Z","Awesome set","Just awesome. Lots of cool pieces and the minifigs are great. I really like the ship (except the front, that looks kinda off, but the rest is great). The tower is well..a tower...not great, but not horrible. Though the flame piece was a nice touch. But really the only reason I bought this was for the ship and that does not disappoint.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-08-09T20:30:15.537Z","A turning point for KK","Finally KK has a fairly good line up. I enjoy the Rogue knight theme and this set is acually pretty good. They finally got rid of the super powered rainbow knights.

Pro's:
- Nice ship that looks like the mercinaries ships in lord of the rings.
- Great use for dragonwings I like how it looks.
- Catupults ( ship+ tower work well ).
- Has an okay amount of figs.
- Nice rogue knights colour scheme.
- Lots of good pieces battlements armor weapons oars rock and tower.

Con's: 
- 30 dollars is a bit much 25 would be better.
- another rogue knight would be usefull

overall this is a good set with lots of playability. I would recomed this to any castle collects ecpesally if they like ships.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"zek","2008-03-26T21:17:55.92Z","Cool boat","his is a geat set,the boat is a little small but it has a great design and the dragon wing sails look awsome.The minifigs in this set are excellent they are detailed and you dont see every day yellow army minifigs. It would of been good if they put another one or two minifigs.

The tower is a little small but works well with the set. Also the catapult works well and gives the set abit more fun factor. Overall a awsome set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2010-02-20T19:45:12.64Z","Not pretty, but a great build","<p>The rogue knight battleship is not a bad set and is hampered by only a few niggly points.&nbsp; However you get an excellent small boat and a wonderful watch tower. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fun to build, interesting construction, i find the construction of Kentis' mace very novel</li>
    <li>Nice helmet, shield and armour pieces</li>
    <li>Ship and tower are wonderful additions to the KK world</li>
    <li>Decent number of minifig weapons/accessories</li>
    <li>All gimmicks work well. Both ship and tower catapults fire brilliantly. The anchor works if you're careful. Sails are fully adjustable on the ball joint.</li>
    <li>Value for money by todays standards</li>
</ul>
<p>CONS</p>
<ul>
    <li>Minifigs are kind of dull, Kentis has the same helmet sculpt as Danju, the rogue knights have no decoration on or under their armour</li>
    <li>Playability is kind of blah, ship and tower catapults ook forced and out of place. The oars are just weirdly placed and actually get in the way of ship play. I liked the anchor though. </li>
    <li>Construction of some places, (base of tower, the flame torch attachment, one of the sail bases) is kind of weak, which once again detracts from play.</li>
    <li>The ship, although impressive, doesn't have a great deal of freedom for minifigs since the sails really get in the way. You have to work to pack in more minifigs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this is a quite unique and altogether pleasant set which flounders a little on it's own but would look great with other castle sets. I would recommend buying this if it takes your fancy.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
"thedavid","2010-12-18T14:05:56.677Z","The ugly ducklet","<p>I don't like this boat, it's more a combination of a dragon and a boat, I think the wings are the most stupid thing in the set. But the building isn't so bad. The minifigures are nice, so that makes the set better. I think also you can play good with it, and value for money is good. Still the design of the set isn't very nice, but you can play well with it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>conclusion;</p>
<p>If you are a build-person, ya aren't going to like this set, but if you are a play-person, you really have to buy it.</p>",TRUE,2,1,2,4,4
"Ernst","2012-07-06T02:18:59.557Z","Rogue Knight Battleship, basic but a good set.","<p>Overall 4 bricks : Knights' Kingdoms II with a facelift. Vladeks' Rogue Knights in yellow and the Kings Knight (here Sir Kantis) finally in a normal Knights outfit. The boat and tower are not the best Lego ever made but in total a nice set with sufficient playability. The 2006 KK-II sets are not that easy to find so maybe a future collectors item. If you're a Castle fan or collector it is certainly&nbsp;worth getting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : Not the greatest challenge, the tower has 2 beams and a rock as base. The small&nbsp;flounder gives it some balance. On the first floor a simple tower panel with a turret on it and a good working catapult. The boat is&nbsp;made on 2 baseplates connected with pins. The turret and several arched bricks and armor figure on the front give it some character. The boat has the same small catapult as the tower. Surprising are the 2 dragon wings used as&nbsp;sails, borrowed from the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Vikings"">Vikings</a> theme. Final result is a strange but nice looking boat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 3&nbsp;bricks : Most points here for the minifigures with&nbsp;great looking shields for Dracus and Sir Kentis. The other used parts are average, some nice arches and a lot of small technic parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : I<SPAN id=result_box lang=en class=short_text a=""undefined"" f=""4"" closure_uid_9bjsyo=""88"" Wc=""null""><SPAN class=hps closure_uid_9bjsyo=""347"" Wc=""null"">n contrast with set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8801-1"">8801 Knights' Attack Barge</a> this set is complete.

Since these 2006 KK II sets are hard to find I think the value will rise in the future.</SPAN></SPAN></p>
