My family emigrated to Brasil in 1978 for a year, and my brother and I were each allowed to take one toy as we went by air and obviously there was a weight limit. I forget what my brother took, but I took my 171 train set.

I never had the motor for this train...well, actually I DID, but the motor set (103?) had long been 'destroyed' by the time I got the train. Shame, but there you go! I still think this is one of the finest Lego sets ever, and indeed today on ebay, one of these changed hands for over &#163;50. On it's own, the set was fantastic, but by adding extra rails and other carriages, the start of a really serious layout could be had. When Legoland evolved, I bought the level crossing set, which naturally integrated the railway with the new Legoland Town theme, and on my return to the UK in 1979, the town grew as fast as my meagre pocket money and Christmases and birthdays allowed. 

To this day, I occasionally get the 171 set out and play with it, even though I am pushing 40! My two children now get asmuch pleasure from this as I did nearly 30 years ago.

I like the overall design of the train and the train cars. The engine is very cool and nicely detailed. The track isn't bad either. If you still own this set, you are a wise person. Lego should bring this one back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
