Well designed set with trapdoor, working battering ram, axe trap and gargoyle heads. While it only has 3 minifigs they look great with the metallic look helmets. Some nice pieces have been used, the large knights helmet and axes and the greeny-grey rock pillars holding up the structure. Plenty of castle bits like arches, battlements and gate doors to add to the collection as well.

Over all this is a greet set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Ernst","2013-01-15T15:45:56.53Z","Gargoyle Bridge; nice but could have been better","<p><strong>Overall 3 bricks </strong>: There are just a few Castle sets with bridges, <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6075-1"">the Wolfpack Tower</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6078-1"">the Royal Drawbridge</a>&nbsp;and this one. Then I would expect the latest being the best but this is the opposite, the 2 older ones win by far. The 2009 <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7079-1"">Drawbridge Defence</a> is much better too.&nbsp;No side walls at the entrance sides, a bit simple and weak looking tower and 2 exorbitant big and unrealistic axes and the silly looking attack cart of course.&nbsp;From the 2006 Knights&#39; Kingdom II&nbsp;sets this is&nbsp;one of the two weak sets together with the Coastal defense&nbsp;tower of <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=8821-1"">8821</a>. With a bit more notice this could have been a&nbsp;good set, in my view a missed opportunity. So a very small 3 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong> : No real difficult or challenging built, first the attack cart with a tower wall and huge helmet. A bit of laziness by the designers in my opinion. The bridge and tower are based on 4 grey/green rock parts and 2 pillars (no blue &quot;water&quot; plate?? ) on which you place a trapp floor and the boring tower with 2 black fences. On the tower you place 2 big axes and on the sides 2 turrets. Entrance and exit are simply 2 big black 6 x 16 plates on hinges.&nbsp;And that is about all there is, also a very small 3 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 3 bricks</strong> : 3 Average mini figures with as exception : the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2586px7"">Rogue Knights&#39; shield</a>. Further on several useful castle parts and some good ones : the grey/green rock parts, several arches and bowes and the 2 <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=53457"">Wolf heads</a>. As mentioned before, missing are blue plates for the water.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong>: for a young Castlefan the set offers sufficient playing possibilities so 4 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;3 bricks</strong> : The average price for sold sets on <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=8822-1"">Bricklink</a> is &euro; 25,00 and sets for sale &euro; 41,00 average. In my opinion the sold average price is the more realistic value and is close to the price I paid.</p>
