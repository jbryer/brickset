"ledaKat","2009-10-20T04:55:56.42Z","Impulsive Purchase, No Regrets","This set was one of those rash, impulsive purchases we all sucumb to every now and then. Often they can end badly, but not this time. I love this set and am really happy I didn't think twice about it!  It has a wonderful mix of minifigs, especially love King Jayko with his white hair he looks so kind and wise and I really adore Lord Vladek's outfit and armour. It is really big and tall and carefully designed to take advantage of every surface. Nothing seems out of place, (except I moved the spider web down to the dungeon).  

The catapult/wagon is an interesting piece, I especially like the colour of the 4 sided cones on the wheels, very unique. The face of the knight on the horse is classic as he screams to gallop away from Vladek who is chasing after him with his sword. I feel a little sorry for the skelleton, he is dead and yet he is condemmed to forever hang for his crime even long after his body has decomposed.

It is a very enjoyable build, challenging at times but also simple at other times, and because it is such a tall set you really feel a sense of accomplishment as you see it growing higher and higher. I like the half green rock pieces and the small green plates that line the bottom of the tower, really looks as though it is rising up out of a marshland. I like the gateway with the teethlike effect and the stickers complete the stoney look of the whole building. I find the side door quite a facinating thing, make sure you keep a knight standing guard or else somebody might sneek in. The little gold triangle touches are nice and the top of the tower with the fire breathing dragon heads and of course that wonderful blue orb really completes the look of this fantasy castle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-07-06T19:17:24.32Z","Mistlands Tower, one of the best Castle Towers I own.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : Lego gave us many Castle Tower sets but in my opinion this is one of the best if not THE best. It is kind of a small fortress with a great entrance, a prison, a&nbsp;modest treasureroom,&nbsp;a good catapult and looks awesome. The sets offers great minifigures, not the bright colored Knights we know from earlier KK-II sets and an attack catapult for the Scorpion Knights. A great set for a Castle collector and for kids because it has great playability. The set is hard to find so if you are a Castlefan, get it if you can. It is worth the money in every way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong> : Great fun building this set.</p>

<ul>
	<li>First the down floor part with on the left side the prison with several great colored rockparts, a door and 2 black ladders as bars. No roof or ceiling but later on scary skeleton will hang above it. The righthand side is also built with rockparts and is connected with arches. On the prison on a small roof plate you install the big catapult.</li>
	<li>First floor above the passage has a great fireplace and a big spiked&nbsp;defenseball. On the left side you attach a technic liftarm with a pulley with a chain on which you hang the Skeleton.</li>
	<li>The second floor (the treasure chamber) is easy, it&#39;s built with mainly 4 pillars and a big wall part with a barred window.</li>
	<li>The third floor has 2 turrets on the sides and center again some pillars and a smaller wall part.</li>
	<li>The fourth and top floor again 2 turrets and has great decorations, namely the chrome blue cylinder and 2 silver dragonheads with torches on the sides.</li>
	<li>The best part of this tower, which distinguises it from other towers is the entrance part. It gives an extra passage before entering the tower. Two similar walls with some wallparts again and 2 heavy doors with silver teeth and 2 torches in front. You attach the entrance with pins to the tower.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also a compliment for the great mix of colors in this tower.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : Again, like in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=44427"">my review of set 8821</a>, a compliment for the minifigures. Unlike in earlier KK-II sets these look great with great shields and weapons, a horse included too and capes for both leaders. Overall this set gives great parts : great grey/green rockparts, 3 doors, several wall parts, a lot of arches, the dragon heads and lots of slopes. Stickers are good too except the ones for the banners, why not 2 printed banners here ?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks </strong>: The content says it all, maybe a Scorpion Knight with horse added with make it even more fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : If you can get it used for the prices of some &euro;70,00&nbsp;you find on <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=8823-1"">Bricklink</a> get it as fast if you can. These 2006 Knights&#39; Kingdoms II sets are good but most of all hard to find. I&#39;m very sure you won&#39;t regret it, I paid &euro;55,00 so the 5 bricks are well earned for me personally.</p>
