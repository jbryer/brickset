<p>This was a fantastic set that I had as a kid that had pretty much all you needed to build anything in the colors of the time.&nbsp; All in a reusable box that you could store it with.&nbsp; It even came with a plastic tray that held certain parts in specific spots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I remember making a TIE Fighter out of red bricks.&nbsp; An X-Wing out of red &amp; blue bricks.&nbsp; When people ask me why I still put together Lego, I think of sets like these and the current sets.&nbsp; Now there are so many more colors and specific parts to create the model I&#39;ve always wanted to put together.</p>

<p>But even with the current sets, none really reach the creative potential of these old Building Sets.&nbsp; It&#39;s awesome I can build a spot on X-Wing now but that&#39;s pretty much all I build.&nbsp; These sets are the predecessors of the current 3 in 1 sets that have alternate builds.&nbsp; So while these sets aren&#39;t still around the way they used so be, I can see glimpses of them in the 3 in 1 sets.</p>

<p>I guess we don&#39;t need reusable boxes anymore.&nbsp; They were cool though.</p>
