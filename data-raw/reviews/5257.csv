Awesome looking set. 
I do not know the rest of the persons that bought this but upon &quot;moving&quot; the tank the treads have a hard time rolling.  My only bad points of the set.

I believe this set repersents a &quot;Mobile Defense tank&quot; Very well.

A Crew of two seems to suffice of what weapons and what the tank can do very well.
  For Movement:  The Desgin and set of a &quot;triangle&quot; tread is a definate improvement against any tank for as being able to travel in almost any terrian.  However, the inability of me to get the treads to move when I push it kinda delays the tank in real life movement compared to &quot;lego movement&quot;
  Maneuverbility:  Just looking at the set cries out a very maneuverable tank.  
  Being a tank, I serely doubt it would travel far from the Gate or Base of the sets.
  Armor:  The Set is pretty well armored.  The cockpit armor for the pilot is well placed, and also protects the system of the tank.  The Rocket pods, as well armored, also provide some &quot;moveable&quot; armor just a shield.  The Treads and wheels are also protected.  However the main gunner is open to any attack.
  Weapons:
With a gatling cannon (whether energy or projectile) is nice main weapon, a energy disk launcher, two large rocket pods, a laser cannon along side the gatling cannon, and four more in a fixe front position shows that this tank is armed and able to dish out as much damage as it takes.
  Firecontrol, sensors, communication:  I see hardly any lego tiles/bricks that repersent any computer controls for weapons or communications.
  Perks and Flaws:  The  tank is well rounded.  

all and all a good set.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"David1971","2007-03-12T17:31:17.903Z","Disappointing","This has got a good overall score from other reviewers, but i found it disappointing. (And i am not normally disappointed - i have been rating other sets recently and they all got 4 or 5!). For one thing, as a tank it is very flimsy. The cool-looking treads are kind of stuck out on the pieces that support them, and also the big guns are attached in a weird loose way, not in the solid and sturdy way you'd expect for a tank. It's like a half-finished a technic model with some minifig bits stuck on.

Also, as other reviewers have noted, the tracks just don't go round as you push the tank along (they should, but mostly don't), which looks bad too.

I'm afraid the design is just a bit rubbish. Lego should be able to do their own designs that are just as good as, say, the Lego Star Wars ships. But, embarrassingly, this is just not very satisfying, whereas say the Lego Star Wars Snowspeeder is an incredibly satisfying design (even if you'd never heard of the Star Wars films). Hmmm.

I like LEGO'S approach- four tilted treats with missile launchers. Although it has no suspension, is impossible to turn, and the weapons look more like icecream cones, the idea in general is very slick looking and it's a good model for those of you who are into displaying your collection rather than playing with them. 

Also, it's impossible to use the bright orange pieces, so you'll probably never break it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-31T19:22:09.29Z","OK..........","I really like this set beacuse of the color, the design, and the pieces. It was also kind of a rip-off beacuse the treads to move and that disk launcher. Didn't Lego test that thing out. Good companies test out their products. I am not trying to insult Lego but that launcher stinks. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Bran_don_jin","2007-03-21T16:56:02.263Z","NOOOOO!"," Horrible set! This has to be the worst set I ever bought. I don't even like EXO-FORCE but I thought it would make a cool star wars tank. I was wrong. The treads barly move and it too fragile.And the price is way too high for such a bad set.GEEZ. I sold this thing to my neighbor who likes EXO Force. May the force be with him.

  It does get a point for haveing cool guns and missiles.     Still don't get it. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-18T15:04:06.043Z","Good and bad","The name mobile defense tank is not very appropiate as it's more stationary than mobile due to useless treads that are very stubborn.

Pros:
Cool looking.
Heavily armoured.
Bursting with weapons.

Cons:
Treads are very stubborn.
Gunner open to attack.
Hard to position the weapons without breaking something.
A bit fragile.

Buy if you like tanks or heavily armoured things that are very destructive.
Don't buy if you're more of a peaceful type or want a moveble set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mOrfeusz","2008-06-04T20:58:31.2Z","Tank Police, anybody?","It definitely remains me of the mecha from this anime.

Pros:
- Reminding of anime tanks.
- Tracks and tracks' suspension are excellent.
- It's orange!
- It's huge, even if a little on the skeletal side.
- Finally an Exo Force set with a pilot well secured in a cabin (on the other hand, the gunner is not secured at all).

Cons:
- The tracks hardly move.
- The disk launcher not only looks stupid, but also does not work properly (not that I care, but there is absolutely no redeeming value to it).
- Intake decals are placed over several blocks, impossible to take them apart without removing the decals.

"vezon8764","2008-10-05T22:25:33.983Z","Mobile Defense Tank","This set is really fun to play with, and I have turned it into a hundred things alone. With a perfect combination of Bionicle, Technic and Exo-Force, this set is perfect and goes well with the Sentai Fortress set.
Pros:
Big
Ryo and Tech
Movable armor
Posable weapon platform
4 treads
Cons:
Treads don't turn when you move it forward, more like skid on the ground
Machine gun falls off
My armor is loose, so it flops downwards a lot.
I forgot half of the important stickers

	Santa got me this set for Christmas a while back, and I must say that he knows a good set when he sees one. This is among the best sets in my collection.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		There are so many things to do with this set; the light brick, the disc launcher, the movable treads...</li>
	<li>
		The tank moves very easily on the treads.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The tank has many gaps and holes in its design, rather than being just one piece of tank.</li>
	<li>
		When moving the tank on the treads, some discs fall out of the launcher thingy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set is truly marvelous, and not the usual Exo-Force mecha you&#39;d expect. A highly awesome set, which is recommended to all.</p>
