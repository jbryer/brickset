"greg_duncan","2006-06-26T23:19:38Z","Absolutely Striking!","This set is awesome. The features are great, especially the drone deploying and the light up feature. The disc shooter is pretty cool too. The colors,parts, and size are nice, especially for the price. The 6 iron drones are great, and Meca One, the gold leader, is amazing once you call LEGO to send you the missing legs. I highly recommend getting this incredible set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"footballfever70","2006-07-15T23:18:22Z","Simply Amazing","Ok, not so simple.  This set is huge!  It has over 600 pieces.  It also has a ton of firepower.  In addition to the two huge gattling guns on top, it also has a disc launcher, twin shoulder mounted guns, two &quot;chin&quot; guns, and one smaller gattling gun on the nose.

It also comes with 6 1/2 robots.  There are 6 iron drones, and the gold leader, but it has no legs.  He is meant to sit in the cockpit and drive this massive mechanism.  The only bad thing is that I was expecting there to be more articulation in the legs, but if there were it would not be able to stand.  It is well worth your money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2008-05-08T20:52:06.2Z","Amazing set.","The first year of exo-force saw the most kits of all three years, most likely due to TLC wanting a huge introductory lineup. One of the most impressive kits of 2006 was the enormous Striking Venom, a kit that was both menacing and well designed.

The Striking Venom’s most noticeable quality it it’s size – a huge 18 inches from one leg to another. It’s especially surprising considering that the kit was only 50 dollars when it first was sold – many kits twice the price weren’t nearly as big. The Striking venom also has many neat details and features - some obvious on the box, others not.

The head and cockpit of the Striking Venom is designed to look like a robot head, using trans-red bionicle eyes and an angled canopy to produce the effect. The legs each have an armed Iron Drone attached to a mechanism that lowers them from a hanging position onto the ground. The large central area has two Iron Drones attached to tubes – probably acting as guidance computers for the Striking Venom’s complex systems. On top, a giant weapons array with a Devastator head wired into the system gives the Striking Venom its main firepower. Other various weapons are attached onto the head and the central dome.

All these details incorporated into the Striking Venom show that the designer were having a lot of fun designing this monster of a mech. Even the poorly made disk launcher doesn’t look bad on it, and the color scheme is terrific.

Piecewise, Striking Venom is largely technic, but there are goodies to be found within. A total of SIXTEEN dark green wedge plates and EIGHT specialized dark green slopes will be very useful, as will be all the black cannons and some lime green detail pieces. Even better is the minifig count – 6 Iron Drones and half a Meca One figure. Yes, strangely Meca One comes without legs, even though the box advertises him as having legs in the kit. Some readers will remember hearing about what a fiasco this turned into.

Striking Venom is by far one of the best Exo-force kits of 2006, if not all three years. It’s not for everyone, especially considering that its size will make it difficult to display. However, any Exo-force fan will get enormous amounts of fun from it, and a MOC’er could find it useful for parts. I highly recommend it. 5/5

"tommyboa","2008-01-18T08:48:23.187Z","Metal Mutant","This is my first Robot model and I even got the Meca One.Plus this modle has a ton of fire power, with 12 guns!  It has a full disc shooter, which is 4 more than Mars Mission Claw tank.  I love how the Iron Drones deploy from the legs.  I agree with the other reviews about Meca Ones missing legs, Lego could have put one in.  It was hard to get the fiber optic wire into the Devastator robot.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-27T11:42:50.817Z","Where is that piece!?","The title says alot,the striking venom is extremly complicating to build.  And now to the important buisness of reviewing.

"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-13T19:13:50.013Z","big? no. BBBBBBIIIIIGGGGGG","THis set is basically a four-legged killing machine!

PRos:
Iron Drone Army
Massive
Powerful turret

Cons:
Meca One doesn't have legs
baseplate is small
not particularly articulated

however, these cons are only if you actively move the striking venom, while in the comics, it basically stays in one spot.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
