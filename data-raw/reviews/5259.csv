"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-27T04:04:37.29Z","wow, but do you have the space","everything on this set is good espesially the fortress itself, i love the entrance, the battle machines are excellent too.
the only warning is if you buy this set you need a lot of space indeed, and i mean a lot, you've been warned!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-31T19:25:36.68Z","YEAH!!!!!","This set rocks! All the robots and mini figures you get are awsome! The mech repair bay and defense tower are cool too. What I really think is kind of bad though is the little rail way vehicle system thing, the vehicles can't go all the way around the base. But I think it's just beacuse of the pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"christopher110","2007-06-05T06:06:05.81Z","The Blue Robot is so . . .","Frankly, I bought this set just because of the Blue robot.... It's so beautifully designed...... It looks so nice even without putting on the stickers......

I was suprised by how much I like the fortress itself. The laser beam in the left tower (looking from front) and all those fortress defense/firing mechanism which can freely move....

"Kiiranaux","2007-06-26T20:52:09.827Z","Amazing Set","I buy every exo-force set twice for the purpose of collection the main and combo models, but this one rocked my world. It had PLENTY of cool designs, and you can arrange the gate to fit in the space you have. 
Pros:
Outer walls-great
Many figs, including sensai
cool details like sickbay
lots of room in center for battle machines
battle machine repair center

Cons:
Outer walls a little flimsy
robot battle machine (rebel front) shaky

All in all, a great set! Worth you $100

"starwarsgeek101_","2008-04-15T14:19:54.06Z","This is huge!","This is a great set and all but first, before you think about buying this set, find a place where you would put this when you are done building this for display or play. It takes up about a yard of space in length and 2 feet in width. After I built it I had to carry it up stairs on a poster board and it was a pain! OK,now to the good part. Thi set can be good for exo-force and for any other battle set, like starwars, or western because it is like a fort. So I'd buy this set If I was bored!   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T13:49:01.327Z","1st review (of many)","I got this set a while ago and it's worth the money. 
It can be used as a base for any theme and people say it's too big but it realy aint.
If u hadn't noticed 3 out of the 4 walls are pretty much flat. I just put it in a box when i'm not using it and it don't take up much space.

Pros:
Great base
2 light up bricks
awesome hero battle machine
tons of extras

Cons
Bad robot batlle machine thingy (though lego still could've got away with taking it out and keeping the price so not that bad)

Write to you soon Yoda will",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legowarroir","2011-01-22T18:58:16.02Z","Get ready Exo-Force team!","This set is awesome! It has some of the coolest mini figures such as almost the entire Exo-Force team(it doesn't have the black haired Exp-Force member), and it has the Robot leader Meca-One and two other robot drones. And it also has two awesome machines and a mini machine. But now lets's talk about the base, it has alot of cool features such as cannons, towers, a hospital station, and a repair bay.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

"Shepp","2012-09-19T10:29:23.383Z","Planning on getting a second","As the title says, I'm planning on getting a second one. Like other reviewers have said, the build seems a bit unsatisfying and flimsy. But then again, there's so much room for improvement.<br><br>The ""fences"" are really lacking, the rear of the mech bays are completely open, as if the base were meant to be backed up against an actual ""mountain""<br><br>With two of these sets (and two Gate Assault sets and the Golden Tower set) I plan to combine them and make an even better compound with four towers, a second mech bay, extended/reinforced fences, two large gates, two small gates, etc. Mostly by rearranging the default configuration of each set's standard builds.<br><br>Also, of all the sets that include Mecha-One, this is the only one that I found that contained his legs. This may or may not be a widespread thing.<br><br>Silent Strike is awesome, Hikaru's equivalent of Takeshi's Supernova, but in blue.<br><br>Mecha-One's mech, though interesting, looks half built. Almost as if the designers just ran out of parts.<br><br>If you can get it on sale, go for it. Don't shell out top dollar for it though.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2
