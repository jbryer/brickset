Can't vouch for accuracy as I live in a non snowing state and have never seen one. Still looks really cool. Using the chainsaw bar and ski's underneath. Small windshield, steering wheel and a hand held radio are the key features of this particular model.

The mini-fig is in blue pants brown jacket and a blue cap. He also has the cool sunglasses and stubble face. This model is small so no real faults but its playability is very limited. Then again what do you expect from a $2 AU model?

Overall its a neat little model and deserves its solid 6/10. A great addition to any town or snow collector and a nice little addition at any general collector.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
