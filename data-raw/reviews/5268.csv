The torsos have the form of a standard 2x2 brick with joints for the large head and the arms. The arms are like the ""elephant trunk"" on 6940 Alien Moon Stalker, the hands are single round 1x1 tiles with a hole in the knob, which are conected to the arm by a trailer couplink-like bulb. Thus the arms wre very flexible.<br>Sadly I have no picture of the that and no instructions, so I never was able to bild it but I remember often going over the torso-head pieces in my big Lego box. Since those figures are much larger than the Minifigs I had hardly any use for the parts, though today, I think they would make nice gentle giants.<br>Nicest piece of the set in my opinion is the grandmother's head with glases and a matching grey hairpiece with a bun.<br><br>",TRUE,3,4,1,2,5
