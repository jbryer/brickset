I&nbsp;very clearly and fondly remember those original simple minifigs, which at the time seemed like a huge innovation. I loved their simple elegance, and I also appreciated their symbolic facelessness. They were a much better scale than the maxi-figures being featured at the time, and allowed for builds on the smaller scale we take for granted now. I fervently wished for the entire group of sets with these new minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forklift part also was special, though this was not my first one. Of course, a set like this cannot compare to modern lego town sets. I don&#39;t think kids today or anyone aside from a serious collector would value this set now. It is simple, with only a few parts and no special tricks. The color scheme is also simple, and uses only the original limited palette. It&#39;s like an old silent movie compared to today&#39;s movies- there&#39;s really no comparison-&nbsp;but trying to make a&nbsp;comparison isn&#39;t meaningful anyway. This set was among the vanguard of innovations when lego was still young and growing.</p>

<p>It is fun to play with (or was, back in the day) and is also charming. The truck readily rolls around, the forklift mechanism was simple and reliable, and the function of lifting the red block works&nbsp;well. Basic stuff, but still quite fine, and my affection for this set endures.</p>
