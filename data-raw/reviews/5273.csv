<p>This is a very simple build and uses the old school &quot;minifigs&quot; that have no posable arms and legs.&nbsp; The police bricks are printed, not stickers, which is very nice, especially for that era. The build is blocky but that makes sense given the selection of bricks at the time. The strangest thing about the bike cop is the fact that his/her legs must be removed to have him on the bike.</p>

<p>The transparent 1x8 bricks that make up the windows on the police wagon have discolored over the years.</p>

<p>All in all, this is the one that started my lifelong obsession with LEGO and to a 4 year old it was really cool at the time!</p>
