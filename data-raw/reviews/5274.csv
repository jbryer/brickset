"ANewell","2018-08-21T06:23:44.907Z","My First and Only Lego Set","<p>Ok - I admit that my rating is reflective of my nostalgia for this set. &nbsp;This was my first and only Lego set as a child (and probably the only Lego set I will ever review). &nbsp;Even then Lego&#39;s were pretty expensive and we did not have money to buy them regularly (as an adult, with a 14 year old and a 9 year old, we&nbsp;currently own pretty much any and every Lego set we want - times have changed). &nbsp;Admittedly I do not have my original set and had to buy this on e-bay but all things considered I thought the price was pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>So, for the actual review. &nbsp;It is really one of the most playable sets ever. &nbsp;You can fly it around like a jet. &nbsp;It has wheels and rolls. And, for the more creative, it lends itself to modifications or extrapolations to a larger version if you have the extra pieces.</p>

<p>I currently have little to no interest in sets with less that 600+ pieces, and really I prefer sets in the thousands. &nbsp;But a set like this sets the imagination of a child on fire. &nbsp;Unlike the M Falcon which was fun to build, once you build it it just sits on the shelf. &nbsp;But a kid can pick up this thing, fly it around, create a story, and pull it apart and build it from memory. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hopefully this review will bring a smile to those that recall it like I do as a child and will help us all appreciate the simple sets that a child can really have fun with.</p>

<p>As a side note, I am a little like Mr. Business from the Lego movie with respect to pretty much all of our current Lego sets. &nbsp;I cringe when I see a rogue Lego piece on the floor. But we still have fun building them and the kids are allowed to play with them as long as they follow the rules.</p>
