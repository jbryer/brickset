<p>Of note are the &quot;old&quot; minifigs as the ones we now know were a few years away.&nbsp; Note how they are carrying the stretcher. They are integrated with the 2x8 plate!</p>

<p>Also of note are the stickers.&nbsp; As shown, they encourage you to place them over more than two pieces at a time.&nbsp; The red cross goes over two 1x2 bricks and I believe the L-386 is placed over two 2x8 bricks.&nbsp; The 1x4 brick with the black lines was a print.</p>

<p>Alternate builds on the back of the box included a bi-plane, different ambulance and a hovercraft.&nbsp; I never quite got how the hovercraft went together but I remember trying!</p>

<p>Anyway, stickers aside, huge play value for a Lego set.&nbsp; It also came in a resuable box with a sleeve that you could replace.&nbsp; It was a fantastic brick building experience for it&#39;s time and a solid toy.&nbsp; Naturally the propellor piece eventually broke with heavy rotor use.&nbsp; All in all a great memorable set for it&#39;s day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Comparing to set 60179, it does look dated but still a darn good build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Of course the part selection and simplicity of the build are dated - and it&#39;s a shame that this came out right at the end of that 1-2 year transitional period when Lego had the original faceless, armless minifigs and was still making vehicles (and buildings) too small for minifig scale. Had this come out one year later with modern minifigs and a minifig-scale ambulance, it would be one of the all-time classic vintage Lego sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But while the figs, ambulance, and (as noted by darthjazno) stickers are nothing special, the helicopter is one of the best Lego has ever designed. The lines are extended, graceful, and classic. The white with red striping/accents is carried through with a tastefulness and consistency unusual for Lego. And there are great design touches: the red modified plates that hold the wheels are flush with the red plates on the bottom, making the landing gear really nice-looking. The red corner slopes on the back of the roof visually line up nicely with the white inverted corner slopes just below them. And those printed vent bricks form part of a narrowing from the body to the tail that is both graceful and angular. Compare it to set 480, the red rescue helicopter from the prior year (1975), and you can see the evolution of the form in this set. (480 is a great set too, BTW.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as playability, the old-style minifigs and ambulance limit&nbsp;that a bit (and I remember having that same feeling as a young child). But the helicopter itself is 6 studs wide and even though it uses an old-style brick-built windshield, there&#39;s plenty of room for a modern minifig to pilot it, and it would be dead-easy to add a 1980s seat and some kind of steering wheel or stick inside. The interior and the doors are also 4 bricks tall, making it unusually roomy for this vintage of Lego vehicle. There too, it would be very simple to add some play features and details to the inside of the main compartment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, as noted by darthjazno, the modified 2x3 plate that holds the rotor is broken in my set too - they almost always broke. But if two of the three prongs are still intact (as is the case with mine), the rotor still turns pretty evenly, about 90% as smoothly as with a fully intact piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are a vintage Lego collector, or if you&#39;re into Lego helicopters, I highly recommend building this set, or at least the helicopter. No need to pay a premium for the complete set, and in my view no need to worry about the stickers. Just get the pieces for the helicopter, and enjoy!</p>
