Good for transporting personal from base to base. overall it's a nice set might as well buy it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

However, the minifigure included is awesome! The gear is amazing, and I love his suit! The saw is also very interesting.

If there wasn't an amazingly good minifigure included, this set would get a 1/5. However, I give it a 3/5 because of the good parts, minifigure, and saw. I do recommend this set to anyone who stumbles upon it.

Parents: this is an easy build. Good for your child to work on. He/she will probably not need help building it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
