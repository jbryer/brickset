The blue windmill rotates 360 degrees on a turning plate.  

I rated this in the context of 1975, when present-day minifigs had not yet been invented.  The stiff figs with no faces make this set a little less fun than it would be with today's movable minifigs, but it's still a fantastic set that I spent countless hours playing with over 26 years ago.  My brother and I played with this set until we wore the studs off of some of the pieces; hence, the wheel bricks won't attach to the underside of the car anymore.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
