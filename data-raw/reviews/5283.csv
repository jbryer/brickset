Doesn&rsquo;t include any useful bricks aside from a lego flag, a few 1x2 red bricks with the lego logo, and a 1x4 white brick with the lego land logo. But these parts are present in many other sets of that era. The fire engines are cool&nbsp;but aren&rsquo;t any different from other sets. There are also nice red window pieces. And a unique plate with smooth parts to act as a driveway for the fire engines. It also has a nice stone path to the main &ldquo;building&rdquo; area. I give this set a 6/10 as it&rsquo;s mostly just white brick with some printed elements but it definitely it a &ldquo;classic&rdquo; set</p>
