"CPMoellering","2020-12-28T14:37:30.13Z","Great set from my childhood","<p>Just re-built this one for the first time in over 40 years. The conveyor and the shovel for the blue excavator are gone to the mist of time, as is the original baseplate. But I still had the rest of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a simple set and a straightforward build from a different era of LEGO. But some great memories of building this one with my dad on the dining room table as a kid. For such a simple set, it had great playability. I spent hours moving the white 1x1 bricks around with the various machines.</p>
