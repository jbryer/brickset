I have over 5 of these figs. The cars don't allow the figs in it. The base board has a white line in it to show were the stuff goes. The motor bikes are OK because it is not like the new ones in motor bike chase. the hone is babyish because of the sticker. Over all this is a old but wonderful set it is worth wait on ebay or amozon.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wildwill","2010-01-15T15:09:07.78Z","My FIRST Lego Set ","This was the first non-generic Lego set that I ever had, and by today's standards it's on that great, but back in the late 70's this was a blast.  These were my first Lego Mini-Figs too, and I'll be damned if I don't want one today.  I may still have some of these pieces too, but not too sure.

My favorite part was the helicopter because it was big enough to put the torso of a fig in the cockpit - the cars not so much.  You won't find very many specialized pieces in this set, and I think that's a good thing.

<p>The&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;are somewhat crude&nbsp;bodies in that they lack&nbsp;detail such as arms and legs and facial markings. It&#39;s a no frills set much like an actual government building and vehicles. Nice old LEGO set.&nbsp;</p>
