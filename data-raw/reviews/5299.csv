I feel I have enough of the pieces to this set to comment on it. There are around 400 pieces in this set and with those pieces you can make the four different sets/designs shown on the front page of the instructions. There are also additional pieces included in this set that don't go to any of the 4 sets shown, such as a digger bucket and yellow brick with grille pattern, which can help you create additional vehicles. This set has a lot of great old parts; the yellow crane bucket with spring, a baseplate, different hinge plates, old blue train track, doors, windows, different sizes of wheels, and a wench with hook. There are a lot of different things you can create with this.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/KQx7PfM.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div>Above you can see most of the parts included in this set.</div><div><br></div><div>Now I will go over the four sets shown. The upper left corner of the instructions shows what I think is a tire factory with a truck and trailer to carry the tires. This is a neat design. I am missing two pieces to the building, so I apologize about that. One thing I have noticed is that in early Lego sets they had factories but you don't really ever see sets of factories now, which makes this a nice design to be able to make. I believe this is the only tire factory ever made by Lego. The blue wench mechanism can roll side to side on the train tracks and the yellow wench part itself can also move backwards and forwards to give you more ability to move it around. You can turn the handle to raise and lower the hook as well. The building itself is closed off and when you open the doors there is no floor on the inside, so it does not have any play-ability on the inside of the building. &nbsp;Below are some photos of that set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/fT1hI77.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/dUzH4G5.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>Not often seen back side of the building. You can see where I am missing a piece.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span>The next set shown on the instructions going clockwise is the helicopter. It is bigger than I thought it would be. The yellow pontoons are a little fragile, if you grab the helicopter by that part they can fall off pretty easily.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/WW26rlM.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span>The bottom right set is a stationary crane, two small yellow cars, and a large boat that can carry the cars. I think I need to find some more pieces before I can put the boat together but the crane is very nice and pretty tall. The boat must be very long. The cars are very small and are much smaller than minifig scale. The minifigs in this set are the old style without arms, moving legs or printed faces so I ignored those guys. This design uses the same wench and hook mechanism as the factory to carry the tires. Below is a photo of the crane and small car:</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/SfDPpyc.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The last set shown is the dump truck and moving crane. This is my favorite design of the four. The dump truck is a very nice big size and I like the&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;parts that make up the dumper. There is a hinge plate below the dumper to allow you to raise it up to drop out the contents of whatever you put in there. The mobile crane is also nice too. I was able to get a bucket that still had the spring in it and it works nicely and is a very nice piece. Below is a photo of those two vehicles:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span>[img]http://i.imgur.com/htSakwO.jpg?1[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><br></div><div>I really like this set. It is amazing that you can make such different things from one group of pieces, and I think this set is more versatile than even many of the new creator sets. Also, having four possible sets to build instead of three is a nice bonus. I had originally bought just the parts to make the dump truck because I liked the look of it and then later thought about getting the pieces to the crane. After putting together each design it spurred me to go on to get the pieces to make each additional design until I have almost all of the pieces to the whole set. I was able to get a majority of the original pieces to this set and the parts stick together very tightly, much more so than newer sets (the pieces appear to be Pat. Pend erased era). It gives the vehicles or buildings a good stability overall but it can be hard to try to take the designs apart. Overall, I highly recommend picking this set up or at least some of the pieces to this set. It is a great vintage set with four very good designs. I am not sure how much this set sold for new so I am unable to comment on the original value for your money. Currently, trying to buy most of the pieces to this set used are not very expensive.</div><div><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
