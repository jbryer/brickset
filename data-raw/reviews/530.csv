"Novelty","2007-05-05T15:06:40.5Z","Push n Fire","This little set seems a stripped down version of so many other sets and at first glance may seem to be a number of weapons and wheels held together by a wheelbarrow.  However it's slightly more than that.  The concept is good - there's the crossbows at the front and the shield to protect the bearer.  The design is functional - it includes handles for pushing the cart and clips to hold the hand weapons for the bearer.  Lookwise it's not too good, but for such a small set, that may be excusable.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This is a small set, the pieces can be packed in a little box or too in a polybag. This another cart of castle, with the castle theme's wheels, useful, but for only castle. This is also another set with crossbows, and another weapons, like the spear, sword and a shield, that can be putted in the minifigure too. The minifigure is also a classic included in the dragon knights series. It is useful, i rate it 5/5. A good option for who is looking for make a medieval army. P.S: this don't shots, if this set was included with a thing that can be shooted, it will make the price grows.
