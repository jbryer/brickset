"iwybs","2019-07-03T16:37:26.453Z","Unsurpassed for 38 years","<p>A friend of mine found the parts for this in a bulk lot and gave them to me, hence the review.&nbsp; This set comes from the last year of the &quot;slabby&quot; era, predating modern minifigures and Classic Space by just one year, but it features its slabby minifigures so prominently it&#39;s hard to know quite how to evaluate it.&nbsp; On the whole, though, I think it&#39;s a pretty neat set.&nbsp; The motorboat has nearly exactly the same form and size as the rowboats I used to build out of basic bricks and slopes for my lone pirate minifigure, and the airplane itself does a good job of looking like a real aircraft within the limits of its parts library.&nbsp; Surprisingly, this kind of aircraft wasn&#39;t revisited until 2015 in the Swamp Police subtheme of City - 38 years later!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the boat and aircraft make pretty decent toys on their own, the best thing about this set is how well it works with minifigures.&nbsp; If you got this kit as a kid in 1977 and then got some real minifigures a year or two later, you could immediately begin using those minifigures with it, with next to no modification.&nbsp; It&#39;s almost as if it was designed that way - perhaps the set designer was aware of the new design and deliberately made accommodations.&nbsp; The motorboat has a 2x4 cabin area for holding two standing slabbies, with a 1x2 brick separating them.&nbsp; Remove the 1x2 brick and you can seat two minifigures.&nbsp; The airplane cabin has a seat consisting of a 1x2 brick on top of a 2x2 brick - the slabbies can&#39;t fit inside the cabin either standing or taken apart to &quot;sit&quot; on that chair, but if you remove the seat you can easily fit a modern minifigure&nbsp;inside.&nbsp; The airplane is just as well scaled for modern minifigures as it is for slabbies.&nbsp; The parts and building techniques are primitive, which makes them well-suited for kids who will promptly break up the plane and build something equally primitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m quite pleased to have this set.&nbsp; It&#39;s sturdy, easy to build and repair, and quite swooshable.&nbsp; Though not as iconic as Classic Space and much easier to reproduce from your own parts library, it&#39;s an important step in the development of the swooshable minifigure-scale&nbsp;flying machine.&nbsp; Like the 1976 Formula 1 car, it can&#39;t hold a candle to modern sets in overall appearance or in the sophistication of the build, but unlike that one it has a feature set that wasn&#39;t reproduced for 38 years, making it a more worthwhile and unique addition to your collection if you&#39;re into that kind of thing.&nbsp; If collecting really old kits isn&#39;t your modus operandi, there&#39;s no need whatsoever to seek this one out - - - but by all means, have a bit of fun building something just like it from your own parts bin!</p>

"peti7788","2022-12-11T17:20:13Z","Beautiful plane, without details","<p>I have the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/371-3"" target=""_blank"">European version</a> of this set, only the set number is different.&nbsp;On the back of the box there is an alternative aircraft and a helicopter can be built from the set.&nbsp;There is a similar seaplane in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/911-1/Advanced-Basic-Set-6"" target=""_blank"">911 set</a>.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Except for the doors, there are no rare parts.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are two types of this 2-color door, one with a horizontal handle and one with a vertical handle. This set includes a door with a vertical handle.&nbsp;By the way, there were already <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1562-3/Biplane"" target=""_blank"">2 types</a> of rear vertical <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/455-1/Learjet"" target=""_blank"">tail for airplanes</a>, perhaps it would have been more elegant to use them.</p>

<h3>Sea Plane</h3>

<p>Clever design, I like it. But, objectively speaking, it lacks small details like the marker light at the end of the wings. For example, a 1x1 red or transparent plate.<br />
The plane is too colorless, too blue, it should have at least one strip on its side of a different color to give it contrast. Or the wings could be a different color, such as white. I don&#39;t understand why the piston engine cylinder is yellow, gray would be more realistic. But at least they thought about the interior and there is a red seat in the cockpit. The wing&nbsp;falls off easily because the two 6x16 wings are not connected or secured at the top.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52557249798_9b9b4f78a2_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<p>If you put a 2x4 plate on top of the wing at the wing joints, it won&#39;t be a problem.</p>

<h3>Boat</h3>

<p>The speedboat is very weak. The length is too short and the front is too straight. Its sides are so low as if it were sinking. And it could be a different color than the plane.</p>

<h3>Figures</h3>

<p>Traditional sculpture figures that do not have printed faces or movable limbs.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I absolutely recommend it, even with the shortcomings, because the set can be improved with just a few small and traditional parts. With a little modification, even today&#39;s modern minifigure can fit in the cockpit. To do this, you need to replace the 4x12 plate under the doors with two 1x 12 plates. And the part under the seat with a piece of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4296467/roof-tile-4x4-45%C2%B0-inv"" target=""_blank"">4X4/45&deg; inverted slope</a> (design code 4854). Thus, the cockpit is already 4 bricks high, so the minifigure can comfortably fit in it even with a hat.</p>

<p>You can also replace the propeller, if the surface bothers you, with today&#39;s technic type.</p>

<h3>My&nbsp;modification</h3>

<p>I completely rebuilt the boat and made it a 1970s luxury speedboat anchored in Monaco. Of course, it was also available from parts in 1977. So it&#39;s also a bit blocky.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52557153985_5234f24a22_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52556684036_68af11afb8_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<p>I replaced the plates on the side of the plane with yellow ones.&nbsp;Thus, the yellow contrast color remained in it. But I changed the cylinders to gray ones. I put an marker light on the end of the wings from a 1x1 transparent plate.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52556706421_67493657ef_k.jpg"" style=""width: 1920px; height: 1080px;"" /></p>

<p>So these are minimal changes, but it makes the plane look better.</p>
