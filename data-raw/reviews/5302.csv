"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-13T05:13:42.073Z","Buy it for Catwoman, but that's about it.","The set's decent for the pricing, especially now that you can find these on clearance at most places, but it's nothing special.

The Catwoman minifig is really what you're paying for, as the Batman comes with, as expected, every Batman set.

The dragster is a cute idea, but kind of silly and clunky in execution. Catwoman's motorcycle is unique--color-scheme is reminiscent of the original first appearance in the comic book, although her costume definitely reflects the most modern incarnation.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-12T01:42:43.75Z","First Batman set and yea baby got to have Catwoman","One of the cheapest batman sets available. I like Catwoman and her motorcycle. Batman's dragster is kinda dorky but it come with Batman. Overall a good way to add Batman to the collection without spending alot of money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-22T12:40:32.833Z","Holy Meowly","This is the smallest Batman set.  It isn't a blatant rip-off of some Town/City set unlike some of the other Batman sets.  However, unlike most other Batman sets, this is possibly the worst one of the lot.

Let's start with Catwoman's bicycle.  There usually isn't any designing to do on a cycle - after all, it's pretty much a standard fixture.  However, where the City Police gets its Motorcycle outfitted properly, Catwoman, it seems is on a budget.  The &quot;ears&quot; on the front where the rear-view mirrors should be are laughable - It almost screams for the presence of some headlights.  The rear of the vehicle is built on the same shoestring budget with a tacky flame sprouting from a holder.  The whip on the other hand, doesn't even deserve a holder of some sort but is poked into a stud that sits on the rear of the cycle.  There's also two extra studs on the side that could have been used for something cool, like perhaps a bullhorn or a grappling hook.  Sadly, neither were provided.

Is Batman's dragster any better?  Well, despite Bruce Wayne's fabled wealth, it seems he's a bit stingy on his dragster as well.  For starters, there's no steering wheel on it, or any printed brick with buttons or a screen.  How is Batman supposed to drive the dragster?  Perhaps he's supposed to manually push it from the back.  Wait, he can't do that, there are two huge flames in the way, not to mention the huge wavelike airplane tail.  There are also a few &quot;hollow&quot; spaces, like on the &quot;wings&quot; on the side just in front of the wheel which could have been filled in with a 1x1 plate.

The design and playability of the dragster is bad as well - the front assembly falls apart too easily.  Also, thanks to the rotating bit, the dragster would not go straight when pushed.  The machine gun piece in the front, but the mudguards seems to be in the way most of the time, and the only time they aren't in the way is when they fall off.  The missiles at the back doesn't even look like missiles and it takes quite a bit of flicking to get it to &quot;launch&quot;.  Of course, they also fall out way too easily in play when you don't want them to fall out.  Colour-wise, the gray stripe just in front of the passenger seat spoils the all-black look of the dragster.

Are there any other redeeming points in the set?  At the very least the roof of the dragster opens and close semi-well... and stays close during drag-races (eventhough the dragster can't go in a straight line).  Also, one of the alternative model - the jet - seems better designed than the dragster, but it still looks like a collection of parts.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

Now for the dragster.It's very simple but so simple there's no controls.It has two flick fire missles, which I despise.The huge bat piece really ruins the set since it protrudes awkwardly.Now the machine gun part is the best and worst part.This is the only batman set that can make sharp turns for high speed chases, but you can't make it go in a straight line.The final thing is that no gadjets are included.

Pros:
Two neat mini figs- batman and catwoman with whip

both vehicles are sturdy, fun to play with, and provide great pieces to expand your lego collection.

  The dragster is small and compact, and I like the hidden chain gun and the flick-fires. I am a bit disappointed that there aren't any controls, though. 4/5

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the smallest of the sets, retailing originally for about $9.99 and is the only set to feature Catwoman. So if you're picking up Batman Lego sets for the villians, this is a must have. And a must period for the Batman fans and Lego fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catwoman's a solid little figure, she's got a purple motorcycle that for the most part is simple with any add-on pieces for a build and serves the function of being what it is. The flame element suggests to me Lego attempting speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dragster isn't too bad, Batman's gotta have a vehicle to be chasing Catwoman down with and he's well known for having a huge assortment and fleet of vehicles to help him with his various missions. Solid build and solid fun. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like an old dog learning new tricks when&nbsp;I see new builds such as the binocular pieces being used on the front end for a gattling gun type weapon. Still in the pursuit of ingenuity and cleverness, Lego didn't forego the function of a batman themed dragster and it's well worth getting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only real complaint is the flick style missle weapons as I am seeing far too many of them and they seem too much of a gimic with the lego designs.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T15:19:03.463Z","The Purr-Fect Crime.","<p>Set #7779 The Batman Dragster: Catwoman Pursuit: This is the smallest LEGO Batman set and the cheapest and it tends to reflect this, however it is still a great little set and I will now take this opportunity to explain why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all you get to build a brand new and unique vehicle for Batman to use, it isn't the Batmobile, the Batwing, the Batboat or even something as off-the wall as the Bat-Sub, but it is a vehicle that could probably fit in with Batman's crazy army of vehicles. And let's face it&nbsp;he's got, like so many you've got to wonder what the point of some of them are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Batman Dragster is small, but it includes Flick-Fire missiles to halt Catwoman from escaping, and it can still fit the Batman Mini-Figure in it, although the cape tends to get bent out of shape while he's in it. Batman probably has a tricky time steering this vehicle too thanks to the odd placement of the rotating plate, but I guess in order to cut tight corners you need a wild mobile front wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catwoman's motorcylce is built predominantly the same as any other motorcycle I suppose (haven't got any other motorcycles yet for my collection.), but it has the good fortune of being purple. She must have a lot of backfiring problems though since she's got a flame sticking out of the top of her bike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Mini-Figures are great, however LEGO could have at least included a spare hairpiece for Selina when she's not wearing her mask. She has a double-sided head, one side with the large goggles she wears as Catwoman the other a more normal face. I missapropriated the spare blonde hairpiece from my Women's Soccer Team (Before I got rid of it) to give Selina some hair for when she's flirting with Batman sans mask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that if you're looking for a fun little set to play and fiddle around with then you can't really go wrong with this one, you get two great Mini-Figures and two great vehicles. As a bonus, you can try your hand at making two alternative models photographed in the back of the book. All you have to do is intuitively guess how the models were made, and that's all the fun of LEGO. If you can get this set for a decent price don't hesitate to pick it up, even if it does come with a few stickers for details.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"legofan266","2011-07-11T02:05:23.46Z","Cool Cat!!","<p><strong>Batman (Grey Suit): </strong></p>
<p>This figure comes in 3 sets including this one. This is my second most favourite Batman character. I just really like the design, I like the grey suit and in my opinnion Batman's real outfit is always grey :D Just like all the other Batman Lego figures, he has a mask which fits over his head, a&nbsp;bit too&nbsp;big in my opinnion, but still really cool figure to get and very accurate to the animated series. He also has the regular expression on his face and he also has a white mark across his forehead, so when you put his mask on, it looks like that Batman has no eyes!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catwoman:</strong></p>
<p>The Catwoman villian is obviously exclusive to this set. She is very well designed Lego character, specially her cat mask and her double sided head. On one side she has the silver eyes (her helmet is see through) and on the other side she has her girly face. She also comes with a whip piece. It 's kind of lame though because on the box it shows her stealing a diamond, but there are no jewels in the set :( </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Batdragster:</strong></p>
<p>This vehicle is for Batman, which is kind of strange. The vehicle it self has two flames on the back and some detail and weapons on the front including the flick-fire missles and the chain-gun that swivels 360. The flick-fire missles are a bit lame, they don't clip into place like the more modern ones, so they keep falling out, which is too bad. The front section on the dragster can also swivel to make it a bit more intresting&nbsp;I guess :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catwoman's Bike:</strong></p>
<p>Catwoman's bike is a very unique purple colour, which is very attractive I suppose, but yeah there are not many features for such a small vehicle. There is a storage for her whip on the back of the motor cycle and a flame on the back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Cool set, if you really like Catwoman, then I would get it, but it is quiet expensive now and it has been sold out for a long time, but it is&nbsp;a good set to get two really small vehicles if you don't like the larger ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Cool set, specially to get Catwoman</p>
<p>- Really cool purple colour for the bike</p>
<p>- Lots of weapons on Batman's vehicle</p>
<p>- Good value for the piece count</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- No bat-accessories for Batman</p>
<p>- Catwoman should of came with a cat</p>
<p>- No jewles are included in this set </p>
<p>- The missiles are very lame, they fall out really easily</p>

"calzonie","2022-07-01T07:07:53.55Z","Sentimental, but Not Impressive","<p>This was my first LEGO Batman set as a kid, and I&#39;ve been a lifelong fan of the theme and its follow-ups&nbsp;ever since. So naturally, this set holds a lot of nostalgia for me.&nbsp;But after finally piecing it back together&nbsp;all these years later, it&#39;s not&nbsp;very impressive in any way, neither as a toy nor a display piece. I&#39;m not surprised to feel that way, even as a kid I realised it wasn&#39;t that good,&nbsp;but it really can&#39;t hold a candle to much of anything LEGO Batman has done since, or even in the rest of the&nbsp;2006 wave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dragster itself is fun to mess around with for a little while, but the turntable piece that guides the front end of the vehicle is flimsy. It&nbsp;starts turning and goes off-course as soon as the front end lifts, which doesn&#39;t take much considering the weight distribution of a drag racer. I feel like it&#39;s worth noting here that neither real drag racers&nbsp;nor most standard LEGO cars have this much built in steering, so its presence&nbsp;here&nbsp;is confusing to say the least.</p>

<p>On the sides of the dragster&nbsp;are&nbsp;&quot;prototype&quot; flick fire missiles. It&#39;s the same idea, but without the specialised piece that we would soon come to know and loathe in what felt like every set for years. They work about as well as the standard missiles (not very well), but they don&#39;t have the technic pin to hold them in place, so they start to&nbsp;spill out of the dragster every time you pick it up&nbsp;at a forward tilt.</p>

<p>The driver&#39;s area doesn&#39;t fit Batman very well. There&#39;s nothing to secure him inside, he has to be placed in an awkward position (nearly laying down with his arms in the air), and even if you have him seated correctly, the windshield just barely rests high enough to close without Batman&#39;s ears stopping it.&nbsp;I find it looks and plays better without anyone inside.</p>

<p>Onto a more positive aspect, Catwoman&#39;s purple motorcycle is sleek. It&#39;s simplistic, but it doesn&#39;t need to be anything more.&nbsp;The same goes for the minifigures. The grey and black Batman isn&#39;t unique to this set, but it&#39;s an absolute classic.&nbsp;Even after 15+ years (and a direct upgrade in 40453), it&#39;s still one of the best LEGO Batman figures.&nbsp;Catwoman, on the other hand, has definitely seen better LEGO designs over the years, but for a first attempt it&#39;s still alright. The silver visor under the cat mask is easily my favorite part.&nbsp;It&#39;s a great choice of color, and it looks a lot better than her alternate face. Something about it never looked right to me. Maybe it&#39;s those eyebrows?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite it still holding a special place in my heart, I can&#39;t recommend anyone actually seek&nbsp;the dragster out,&nbsp;especially with the absurd second hand&nbsp;pricing of all the original Batman sets on sites like Bricklink and eBay. The Batman minifgure and the motorcycle might be worth it on their own if you find a good deal, but as a whole this set has been outclassed in just about every way over the years.</p>
