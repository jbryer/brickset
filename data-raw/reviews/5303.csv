"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-02-28T06:06:37.637Z","Not What We Expected...","...But cool anyway! More of a Bat-hovercraft than Batboat, this set is not what most fans expected. But, surpirsingly, it's still an amzingly cool one, that is a rather interesting build. Ditto the mini Bat-Ski, though. It is small and does not do much. Killer Croc's speedboat looks really cool, however, sporting a sweet printed-on crocodile (or alligator?) snout. This set provides for wonderful MOC opportunities, if you don't agree with what the instructions lay out for you. Pretty sweet on the whole.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"David1971","2007-03-12T17:46:06.107Z","OK but a bit strange","This is OK, with some neat parts ... But i would prefer one solid, well-designed boat. This is basically a large boat with a big gap in the back (where the smaller boat goes), and doesn't seem like a proper functioning vehicle. I bought this when the shop had run out of Batmobiles ... but i should have waited for a Batmobile really ...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-13T05:18:34.277Z","More fun than you'd expect...and another new villain!","I wasn't too crazy about this set when I first heard about it--I guess I'm alone in this one, but I'd much rather have locations/hideouts/etc. than a handful of vehicles. Batmobile and Batplane, yes, but the Batboat? Ehhh. To top it off, Killer Croc isn't what you'd call a &quot;headliner&quot; villain.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised.

PROS
-The Croc minifig is actually really awesome!
-Croc's boat is neat, with a cool pre-printed design.
-The Batboat (although it's more of a Bat-Hovercraft) has cool rubber edges which lend to the &quot;realism&quot; factor of the set. I wanted to float this out in my pool after I built it, although quickly decided that was a bad idea...

                                                   The minifigs are quite detailed, although I would've put Penguin  and one of his subs instead of Killer Croc and his speed boat. If I were to keep Killer Croc, I would've made the flick-fire missiles out of-well, flick-fire missiles. But I guess I'm a bit biased since Lego didn't manufacture those pieces until 2008.
                             I think I speak for everyone when I say Batman's Batarangs are to big. Along with his head. It took me a while to figure out that that ''U'' shaped tool was a pair of handcuffs. Well done, Lego. I still like the new ones better. Smaller sized. The hand gun and tommy gun are great touches. There could've been more, though. Those doughnuts with batwings? I still don't get what those are or what they're for.
                        Now, onto the Batboat. Not much to it. More like the Bat-hovercraft. Tee hee hee. The turning engines are pretty cool. I would've added a few flick-fires to it. And uh, that's pretty much it.

"jgptee","2008-07-16T12:57:59.217Z","he needs a boat too.","this contraption looks more like a small hovercraft to me. maybe next time, we will get a powerboat. the batboat looks nice, and has a water scooter attached to it, ready to shoot out from the back. interesting enough, the croc water scooter can also be attached to the back of the batboat. lol! the croc scooter looks kinda scary and well-built, apart from that funny-looking rod that sticks out from its back so it can be attached to the batboat when the killer croc is captured. i simply removed that unsightly thing and it now looks perfect. one big drawback about the batboat is that the clear cockpit windshield does not have a hinge, and can only be opened by plucking it off entirely - oh dear, a big -1 for this!

The Batboat is not what one would expect but it is cool nonetheless. As others have stated, I am a big fan of the fact that the design on Croc's jetski is PRINTED on!

"Batmaniam","2009-01-18T15:55:26Z","Seriously? This Set Spells One Word: Terrible","This set is terrible, the boat doesn't launch off, you have to pull it off. Batman doesn't have any weapons on his boat, and where does his bat gadjets go? Crocs boat is very chunky, and doesn't look good, although I do like that the croc design is printed on. Also the flick fire missles are as usual terrible. One part that I don't understand is that why is Croc wearing jeans? And why is he wearing gloves? Maybe he just changed the Croc boats oil, and forgot to steal a towel. I changed Crocs pants with Indiana Jones', and now Killer Croc looks better. The only thing that keepd this set form getting a 1, is the pieces an minifigures. Some of the pieces are good. One thing that Lego should have done, was that they should have put Robin in the back of the Batboat, and launch out. So I changed Robins boat, so that it fits in there. Not a good set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-05-25T15:31:49.77Z","The Batboat Review","<p>Batman.... there's a theme and one that created a renaisance for me with my love of lego. As with many of the batman sets, they revolve around vehicles that Batman has utilized at one time or another with Cartoons, Movies and Comics. And if it's not a particular vehicle that's being sought after, it's the minifigure villian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, it's Killer Croc, the villian minifigure that's part of a draw for me with this set. He doesn't look too bad, just a bit funny looking for me, but it's one more villian to pit against Batman in a Lego Town or City. Batman's good, redundant by this time for me as I've been collecting up all of the sets and nearly of the batman sets have him in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of the set at its time wasn't bad, being more medium range on pricing, but now days, if you can find it at all, the price has sky rocketed with both Lego &amp; Batman collectors seeking out these sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm not a huge fan of boats, this really is a good boat design. And knowing how Batman likes to be prepared, this one allows for him to hit the waters. While the main boat is huge and offers up speed and sleekness of desigh, I do love the little bar for the back engines so they can both turn in tandem as the boat moves through the open waters. Then there's a smaller little water skier deal for when batman really needs speed and being able to get into tight space like say a sewer or swamp. Which he'll no doubt need when pursuing Killer Croc on his water skier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite my lack of love for the lego boats, this is a solid and fun build and like all of the batman sets, well worth getting and adding to my collection.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-30T10:50:28.3Z","Killer Croc is Escaping!","<p>Set #7780 The Batboat: The Hunt for Killer Croc: The LEGO Batman theme really impressed me when it was first launched and I wish it had stuck around a bit longer on store shelves because it offered up quite a bit of fun and unique new mini-figures for your collection. As it stands these sets are ridiculously hard to come by now and super expensive, so if you can afford them, great, but if not... Well then you're like me. Pining for what could have been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enough depressing thoughts though, let us review this wonderful set. First of all though I will say one other thing, the Instruction Books needed to be better thought out for these sets, they are so saturated with Black undertones that it makes it hard to figure out some of the placement of the pieces and it is very easy to miss a step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said building the Batboat is still fairly fun, even if it can be a little bit frustrating due to the all black pieces and the problems with the instructions I mentioned above. It also includes some nice new pieces and the long rubber bits that make up the shape of the boat really look impressive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Killer Croc's little getaway speeder/jetski suits him to a T, the design is simple and the added printing on the bricks giving it that croc like face make it appear sinister and funny all at the same time. The Batboat comes with a miniature Jetski also and a place where it can dock with the larger vehicle using a Technic piece. Thus Killer Croc's vehicle can also be docked with the Batboat for whatever your imagination feels like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Killer Croc has a machine gun and flick-fire missiles while Batman gets three batarangs, his grapple gun and two grappling things (I seriously don't know what they are called and LEGO might have had a better time of it if they chose to include some string to attach to the grapple thing so it can actually be used as a grapple.) Batman's vehicle does not have any sort of launching projectiles however, but they do include two stationary weapons that can be laser guns, bullet launching guns or even foam launching weapons to gum up Croc's vehicle's propellor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures make great additions to any display, you get a Batman of course, complete with cape and cowl and you can swap out the cowl for a piece of hair you might have on hand to turn him into unmasked Bruce Wayne. Killer Croc is impressive looking and looks both menacing and cute all at the same time in LEGO form. Neither of them have double-sided printing... I believe, but they both look great and very DC-ish amongst the rest of your LEGO Mini-Figures. You could even customize some figures if you wanted with the parts included in these, personally though I just enjoy having Batman and Killer Croc in my collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say if you're a fan of Batman and Batman LEGO then this set is a must have even if it does cost more than at retail these days, after all if you're patient you can always score a great deal. Especially if you find a few lots for sale on E-Bay. It's just a shame that this Theme didn't last as long as Star Wars did, or that LEGO didn't try to get all of the licensed characters from DC to at least make one LEGO Batman Justice League based set with Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Marian Manhunter and a few others to man the Watchtower or something. Oh well, that's what customizing is for.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"legofan266","2011-07-14T00:16:00.787Z","Human Crocodile!!","<p><strong>Batman (Grey Suit):</strong></p>
<p>The grey-suited Batman is in 3 sets. He is in this set, Batdragster and Batwing. This is not the cheapest set to get this figure and I hope you don't get this set just for this figure!! He comes with some Bat accessories and I beleive this is the cheapest set to Batman's accessories, because they don't seem to appear in the smaller sets. The pack includes several batarangs and handcuffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Killer Croc:</strong></p>
<p>This set is the only ever set that you can get Killer Croc. He has awesome detail on him including red eyes and muscle on his torso. This character has not been in any of the Batman movies, but has been in the animated series and ofcourse video game. This is one of my favourite characters in the video game, because he can do backflips, he can go underwater, he can go through chemical and he can lift up heavy things!! A very popular figure in the video game and&nbsp;I love having him as a Lego figure. A tommy gun and a machine gun are included with this figure ;D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Killer Croc's Jet Boat:</strong></p>
<p>Jet boats can get very boaring to have, but this one is different!! It has printed pieces on the front of it with an awesome crocodile picture. Nothing else to say about the jet boat except for the spinning propellors and ofcourse the flick-fire missles. The flick-fire missles are pretty lame because they fall out. They don't clip in like the newer versions of it ;(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Batboat:</strong></p>
<p>This vehicle is one of my favourite Bat-vehicles besides the Batmobile. It can fit perfectly on the turntable in the Batcave. This vehicle is approximately the same size as the Batmobile in length and width. It has the openning cockpit just like all the other Bat-vehicles. It has controls inside with a little storage spot for the batarangs. The other feature is that whenever the batboat makes a turn, the back propellers turn side to side. There is also a small Bat-vehicle attached to the back of the Batboat and it's sort of like an escape boat for emergencies. You can also attach Killer Croc's jet boat at the back of the Batboat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This is a great set although just like all the other Lego Batman sets, it's very rare and pricey, but it's deffinetely worth getting if you can find it for a good price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Very good value for the piece count</p>
<p>- Cool figures, especially Killer Croc</p>
<p>- Good amount of play features for the price</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- Stickers (not many though)</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-16T00:21:09.757Z","Great Batman Set","<p>The Batboat: Hunt for Killer Croc set is a great set from the batman&nbsp;theme. It includes 3 vehicles and 2 minifigures. It was released in 2006 for&nbsp;$20.00 and has 188 pieces. It was in the 2006- 2008 Lego Batman theme.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batman- </strong>This version of batman is in a gray batsuit and has good printing. This Batman minifigure was in 3 sets total. 9.5/10</p>

<p><strong>Killer Croc- </strong>This minifigure is a good figure that is regular size which is smaller that the Killer Croc&nbsp;figures that come after this. The printing is not that detailed but still good. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Batboat is an excellent build and includes a jetski that is attachable to the back. Killer Crocs&nbsp;jetski is small but still a good vehicle for him. Killer Crocs jetski has two printed pieces at the front showing a crocodile face, and it also can connect to the Batboat. His jetski also has two flick fire missiles on the side. The two fans on the back of the Batboat are connected and can move left to right. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is a really good set that looks great. It has excellent playability and is just fun all around. if you want to display it is also pretty good to display. The minifigures are great especially for 2006. All the builds were good except for Batmans jetski which is a cool feature that it can connect to the bat boat but it doesn&#39;t really have much to offer.</p>
