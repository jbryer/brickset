"Com161","2006-04-07T22:43:02Z","Hmm...","I have to agree that the mini-figs are cool, but there are a few down-falls that I will point out in this review.

First, the ups:
Lots of play features
New weapons!!!
Cool mini-figs
Cool vehicles
Gate
Spike Strip

Now, the downs:
Instructions are unclear (Like what Bergie pointed out.)
Needs a bank for Two-Face to rob
STICKERS!
If everything Two-Face has or does is based on the number two, WHY DOES THIS SET ONLY INCLUDE ONE HENCHMAN!?

Overall, a few more things could be added. Yet, it is a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-01T23:29:42.94Z","Holy Aerodynamics, Batman","The Batmobile is batman's signature vehicle (at least for those of us who remember the campy series from the 70s and the cartoons from the 80s) and there's a larger version to satiate the needs of people who like big cars.  This version though is supposed to be the fun version, and hence the addition of the cannon to the front of the car.  Unfortunately, design takes a hit as it means that the front of the car is dominated by the cannon to the extent that the bonnet is divided into two and the batmobile loses its sleek lines and looks ugly and silly where the cannon is.  The rest of the batmobile is properly designed with numerous flat plates to give it a smooth sleek look.

Two-face's vehicle on the other hand is fun, with the target at the rear that tips two-face off the roof.  That's gimmickly, but that's also not an icon.  The other thing of note is the lamp-post which again has that gothic look.

Overall a nice set, spoilt by the poor addition of the cannon to the front of the batmobile.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-13T05:24:39.68Z","One of the better Batman sets!","The Batmobile is THE signature Batman vehicle, so needless to say this was the most exciting vehicle set for me.

PROS
-Two-Face. He might be the best Batman minifig yet. He comes with a coin, and of course, his tommy gun.
-Batmobile is awesome, has a sleek design, and the missile ain't too shabby, either!
-Two-Face's escape vehicle is a lot of fun, and the action feature doesn't detract from the design, either!

CONS
-Two-Face needs TWO henchmen!
-The front of the Batmobile could look a little nicer (i.e. remove the action feature, replace it with something more aesthetically pleasing)
-The minimal spikes/streetlamp addition is pretty lame. Why not include a Bank front?
-For that matter, include some money!

PROS
- New gun pieces+ batman has some batrangs and handcuffs for       batmen.
- Batmobile is bigger than it looks and looks good.
- Has a few gold coloured pieces.
- Shooting piece which you can never have to many of.
- With a few modifications the bank truck can be used in towns as a regular bank truck.
- The set also comes with a little gate which can de used in a town or for pieces.
CONS
- Instead of Lego coins they just give you a few silver studs.
- Three minifigures is pretty low for a forty dollar set.
- It's too much money 30-35 dollars would be better.
- Junorized pieces (batwing's and a few others.

Two Face's truck is pretty strong and two gun things.The place where two face sits is unstable(so he can Fly)and speaking about that,the missle on the batmobile doesn't work since it needs to be raised to hit the truck.Also there is no money,so what's two face supposed to steal?
The batmobile has a blunt shooter but it's the only weapon.I was expecting hidden missiles and mines,like in Batman Begins.The two bat wiings are the major flaw because they easily fall off and ruin it.The good part is that there is a compartment fo the gadjets and there are lots of controls(steering wheel,two side controls, and computer.

Pros:
Great vehicle designs(unlike some reviews I think the missile does not ruin the front of the Batmobile)
Great sleak new pieces - around the missile launcher
Street lamb/gate/spikes
Two-face mini figure
Batmobile boot(trunk)
Missile(even if it does not work properly)
Two-face launch seat
The use of the stud for Two-face coin rather than a coin that would not go on his hand correctly
Red clear pieces in the batmobile look really good
Batmobile can be put on the turntable in the Batcave(7783)

Cons: 
Only one henchman
No money
No bank(or at least something to rob or rob from)
Instructions a little unclear
Bank truck had a few pieces on the white side not white
Missile does not hit the target unless Batmobile lifted slightly

I have given this set four stars however as I am after it's looks more so and it does look really good in the Batcave, alot more so than the Batsled.
Overall the sets biggest downfall is the missile not working but it is a very good looking set and so gets my thumbs up.

I have the this one and the collectors one and I like them both a lot.  To be honest with you though, I think that this might have even beat the collectors (I was pleased) considering the collectors had no weapons or gadgets whatsoever on the batmobile.  Anyways back this one.  One of my most favorite parts was the launching missile used on the front.  The fins on the batmobile are a bit large but the rest makes up for it.  You do have to put on a few stickers but its not too bad.. Also the batmobile has a trunk to put the gadgets in. I liked two face's bank car also fitting his henchmen in the driver's seat and him on top.  Two machine guns come out of secret compartments on the sides and if you shoot the back, two face flies off the top.  Instructions easy to read, gadgets with the two batarangs, handcuffs, and two other bat thingys (that I still can't figure out what they are used for) are included.     Also included is Two Face coin and two machine guns.  Two Face is pretty sweet although the Joker in it would have been better.

it's also the only set that comes with 2-face. i am not that keen on the 2-face truck though as it does not serve much purpose except to eject 2-face from the roof. however, the truck is very open for further enhancement or moc if you have the time for it.

Two Face is an awesome minifig,and his goon rocks too,I wish there was a way to get more!

"TheDarkKnight","2010-09-23T11:56:15.763Z","A Shining Jewel","<h4>On Christmas Day, 2009...</h4>I received this set. I was ecstatic - I had wanted it when it came out way back in '06, but hadn't been able to raise the funds at the time. This was the first thing I did after Christmas morning was over with. I went upstairs and began assembling The Batmobile: Two-Face's Escape.<br><br><h4>The Build:</h4>A pretty straightforward and easy build. First, as usual, comes the smaller ""villain-mobile."" The van is actually a more complicated build than one is led to believe just by looking at it. Folding out from the sides are rotating rocket launchers or gatling guns, decorated with stickers, and it all culminates in the villain-launching mechanism, supposedly achieved through launching the Batmobile's front-mounted missile at two round pieces connected to the top of the van, where Two-Face sits. If you hold the Batmobile's front end up slightly, then the effect is achieved in it's full glory, and Two-Face flies off the top of his van into the wild yonder.<br><br>Next comes the hero's form of transportation, the Batmobile! This design was obviously based off of the 1989 Tim Burton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Batman</span> flick, and it achieves that design <span style=""font-style: italic;"">almost</span> perfectly. Hindering the sleek design is the aforementioned front-mounted missile, necessary for the ""playablility"" portion of the set. While this flaw is relatively minor, and far exaggerated by some reviewers of this set, it does serve to throw off the overall smooth and sleek look of the Batmobile. Other playability features on this vehicle include the opening trunk (Robin's compartment), the movable wings on back, and the hinged windshield, all of which serve to make the play experience much more authentic.<br><br>Unfortunately, the build suffers from the goofy add-on, which, as much as it could have been (I drool over a bank front), would fit right into the Tim Burton Batman universe.<br><br><h4>The Minifigures:</h4>As some might expect from other reviews, the minifigures are absolutely spectacular, especially the exclusive Two-Face. His hair and headpieces are not to be believed. Excellent printing here, excellent printing. The generic thug is, as always, present, but he has a Two-Face themed torso, making him another unique figure to this set. The Batman matches his car in the '89 Burton-themed costume, which was, for a while, anyway, exclusive to this set. He looks spiffy, as he should, and even intimidating for a LEGO figure. I was very pleased with LEGO's decision to print the Bat-logo-and-belt in gold instead of the yellow used in the Batwing set. It looks very good.<br><br><h4>Conclusion:</h4>This is a set that no true Batman LEGO fan should be without. It contains two exclusive minifigures, and they're all also rare. I would certainly fork over the money for another one of these if I didn't have higher priorities. If you can find it at a price you deem decent, pick it up fast - cause that's the way it will be going!<br><br><h4>Overall Rating: 4.9/5</h4>for a solid, sturdy, and well-designed set.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Batmaniam","2009-01-21T12:41:50.013Z","Okay Awsome, Amazing, Great, Ultra-Cool, ect","This is a very, very, very, very good set, considering that I got in on sale for $25, it was a steal. This is also my first Batman set, that started me on a rampage to get every single one, but then six more came out, so I have to earn some money to get them. The only flaw is that either the bat rocket launcher is set too low, or the Two Face Brinks Truck's trap door thing is set too high, but when you fire the missle you have to lift the front of the car up so that it hits it in the right place. I really like the old school sleek and curved batmobile, it reminds me of the old T.V. series. Another thing that might come in handy, is that if you take out the bat gadjets from the trunk, you can fit a passenger (Robin). But yeah there are some stickers, but not too many. I really like the road block, with the lampost, it can go in any town scene. And the little spikes are a nice touch. Now onto the Two Face Brinks van, the hidden guns are really nice, except in the picture it makes it look like transluscent yellow, but really they are just yellow pieces. The van has some rare elements, and is just an awsome little van. My favourite minifig in this set is Two Face who has a really cool hair piece, head, torso, legs, and coin. One way to make this set awsome is to get the little motor engine block, with pistons and air scoop (as seen in off road power), you take out the two middle pieces in the front of the van, and you put that piece there, and it looks really cool (it looks like jokers ice cream truck). But it should have come with two tommy guns, since it is two face. Also it come with a nice chain piece.

There's nothing special about the Batman and Henchman figures, but Two-face really takes the cake.  This minifig is exclusive to the set, and the detail on the suit, face, and hair is inspiring.  This is by far my favorite minifigure of the entire batman line, however it's too bad they didn't include an extra hair piece and a double-sided head piece so you could have a Harvey Dent minifig also...

Minifig Rating: 4.5/5.0

The Vehicles:  Two-Face Escape Van, Batmobile

Half white and half grey, the Two-Face Escape Van is a pretty cool looking vehicle, but I can't figure out why they've included both Two-Face specific and Gotham City Bank decals.  Did he steal the van from the bank and then spray paint it half white?  This doesn't make any sense.  Also the mechanism that tosses Two-Face off of the van is lame.  They could have filled the van with weapons and money bags, and it would have been much cooler.

The Batmobile on the other hand is a real treat.  It has a challenging build due to the large amount of black pieces utilized in the construction.  It also has a rear storage compartment for all of your extra bat-a-rangs and handcuffs which was a pretty cool feature.  I could have lived without the two wing pieces attached at the back since they sort of detract from the overall sleekness of the vehicle.

Vehicle Rating: 4.0/5.0

Accessory Build:  Roadblock with gate

What a waste.  Really, we needed that roadblock and gate?  This accessory has a simple construction and adds absolutely no value to the set.

Accessory Build Rating: 2.0/5.0

Overall Aesthetics:

This set looks great when completed and even better when displayed.  Even though the Two-Face van doesn't make any sense, it is none the less very appealing in color scheme.  The Batmobile is also the best (batman specific) vehicle in the line except for the Tumbler.  With the three minifigs that come with this set (most sets in this year came only with 2 figs), 7781 is well worth the purchase.

<p>This is really the greatest batman lego set of 2006 next to the batcave, I must say it is quite large, and the minifigures are great, you may be able to see the great bits of this set but it is so much more awe inspiring in real life.</p>
<p><strong>The batmobile</strong></p>
<p>The best vehicle of the batman range, it is just perfect but&nbsp;I would like to ask does anyone think it is quite large compared to normal lego cars and minifigures?. I has the cool shooter missle and awsome&nbsp;bat wings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The lamp post car stop thing</strong></p>
<p>Not the best&nbsp;thing about the set, I mean lego why ruin a perfect set with somthing that could be easily replaced with somthing like a bank front, or maybe a vehicle like the thin mini batmobile in <em><strong>batman returns</strong></em>&nbsp;or maybe a bat glider?.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The two face bank car</strong></p>
<p>very good but a little small for my taste, I hate the flick thing on the back it is just not like two face to put a mechanism on the back of his truck and just wait for Batman to take him back to AA (arkahm) but maybe he found the batmobile specs and found out that the missle was to low to hit it.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>Two face: speechless JUst great to have a great menacing villan, he looks great and his suit and hair a great to.</p>
<p>Batman: I'm batman, I must say his black suit is very cool but dosent cut it, the batmobile is deserving of a blue suited batman.</p>
<p>Two face henchmen: He must have been cloned from Jokers henchmen.</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>The best most perfect lego set I love it and you will to.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"xhunter94s","2010-03-22T18:09:58.28Z","Pretty Awesome!","<p>I got this for $20 dollars last week from my friend. It was missing the flames on the back and a few of the pieces in the back of the van (all the stickers though) so I had to glue the pieces to eachother than the thing that goes up and now it's fine (the thing is a round outward facing disc that sends two-face off a board when you shoot a missile from the batmobile)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a road block with some spikes and a lamp and a stop sign (which I did not get:( oh well) There is a storage for batarangs, batcuffs, etc. but I put Robin in or when I capture a villain I put him (I don't have any female batman lego minifigs.......yet;)&nbsp;I want the Asylum set) back there in the back of the Batmobile. I like the design of the Batmobile but Two-Face's van is smaller than expected (I think vans should be bigger than Indiana Jones gas pump trucks which are meant to be the small kind).</p>
<p>&nbsp; There is the 1989 batman (my fav lego batman), a goon, and Two-Face. Two-Face is really awesome his hair on one side is all crazy and white and he has a really cool coin. The goon is simple same face and hat and pants as the goon in the batwing set the tumbler set and the batcave set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall this is a great set which I would highly reccomend.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"AETerry","2011-05-26T17:12:17.423Z","The Batmobile: Two-Face's Escape Review","<p>This is one of my favorite sets from the Batman theme as it features the iconic Batmobile from the '96 movie with Michael Keaton playing Batman. The minifigure of Batman is even styled after the '96 Batman custome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only part of the batmobile that I don't like it the forward firing cannon. The firing weapons and flick missles feel too gimicky and detract from my overall enjoyment of a set like this. Otherwise this vehicle is sheer awesomeness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other vehicle in this set is Two-Face's Armored Car he's making a get away in. What's a bit cool for the design, that while an armored car, is split in grey &amp; white coloring for a cartoonish version or campy version of Two-Face. There are side mounted weapons that come down from the side on this car. While Two-Face himself can be seated on top, the car is designed that when the cannon from the batmobile hits it, it can send Two-Face flying. There is too a henceman for Two-Face to provide cannon fodder against batman and make getting Two-Face a harder challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final little build to this is a street light with a stop sign and chain pulled across like it's to block off a side street that Two-Face and barrel through as Batman chases him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $30 when this set first came out, it was well worth it, adding to my collection. Though now days it's price has gone through the roof with both Lego and Batman collectors seeking out this set.</p>

"TheLEGONationalist","2017-07-04T01:11:14.873Z","Greatest Two-Face Ever!","<p>To begin the art of the box is really cool, and the play features shown in the back are pretty much what you get. (This does not mean that it is bad or anything)</p>

<p>The piece count for the original price is really good, you get cool pieces, like the wheels of the Batmobile, the streetlight, the cannon, the three exclusive minifigures and those 1x1 spike pieces (there are a lot of them)</p>

<p>The building has no outstanding techniques but it left me satisfied, the Batmobile&nbsp;is the greatest Batmobile&nbsp;I have seen,in my humble opinion.. I really enjoy the Two Face Truck it goes really good with the character and with the Batmobile, the dark gray-white scheme is proper ( I have seen how it would look in black but I personaly prefer the grey)</p>

<p>The minifigures are just amazing (Yes, even the generic faced goon) but the greatest it&#39;s Two Face, carefully detailed faces, awesome new (in that time) hair piece and a beautiful looking suit. Batman is also really cool, exclusive dark suit and golden utility belt are great, the goon is a great figure because of the shirt and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>The playability is great because of the exploding feature of the truck, the trunk in the Batmobile&nbsp;and the TWO extra builds.</p>

<p>My only &quot;personal complaint&quot; it&#39;s that it should have had TWO goons (come on, it&#39;s TWO-Face)</p>

<p>I spend a long time trying to find this set sealed and in good condition and it worth it entirely.</p>

<p>I highly recommend&nbsp;this set.</p>

<p>The vehicles are very good for the price. while i would have wanted a better two face van, the batmobile&nbsp;is outstanding! i bought the set for the two face stuff but i was a bit sad because of the back of the van. There was nothing in there! i would have preferred something cool or&nbsp;useful in the back but no, just a lame play feature...</p>

<p>The figures....and the other stuff</p>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;Are 6/5 The two face is exclusive and so is the henchman.</p>

<p>the batman is pretty generic but still cool!</p>

<p>the other stuff...not anything interesting but adds playability for the set.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>One of the best old batman&nbsp;sets. i think that this set is the third or fourth best set from the Og batman&nbsp;theme.</p>
