"Com161","2006-04-25T01:06:26Z","Great set!!!","To start this review, I would like to mention that the instructions in this set are a lot clearer than the ones in the Batmobile set. (Horray!) I should also point out that this set is a lot sturdier than you may expect. Now for the rest of my review:

First the ups:
Set is very sturdy
You get three mini-figs (The Joker, Batman, and a henchman.)
When leaned back all the way, the hidden missle fires atuomaticlly.
Hidden weapons on both vehicles
The Joker choper can drop Joker bombs
Lots of Batman Gadgets

Now the downs:
NOTHING!!!

Overall, I would recommend it for any lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-01T23:40:35.52Z","Holy Incredible, Batman","This set is great.  Joker's copter is the standard chopper design, but modified to enable two missile launchers to fold out from the side and to include the rope ladder.  As if that's not enough, the rear of the chopper has been modified to drop the neon-yellow bombs.  Modifying the landing struts to pontoons also mean that one could roleplay it landing on water - perfect for transporting joker to the Hall of Doom setting.

The batmobile is no slouch either.  Hinged wings give it variable geometry and together with the masterful design produces multiple looks during play.  Below the set of rear wings are launchable missles which sits pretty still on the craft unless revealed by changing the position of the wings.  The aircraft comes complete with the same cannon as the smaller batmobile, but unlike the batmobile, it is positioned to the rear of the jet and does not destroy the smooth lines of the craft.

It makes one wonder why can't all Batman vehicles and sets look like this...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-13T05:29:43.807Z","If you get one Batman set, this is it.","Seriously. First of all, it's a great set. Second of all, you get the most iconic comic face-off: Batman vs. The Joker. Nothing better.

PROS
-The Batplane is sturdy, has some awesome hidden missile launchers, and even comes with a stand so it can sit upright! You know, for Bat-maintenance...
-The Joker's copter is pretty standard, but the color redesign, stickers, and little accessories make it a lot of fun. Plus, between this and Penguin's sub, there aren't any other major vehicles for villains.

CONS
-NONE

Buy this set! It's fantastic! The perfect Batman LEGO set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2008-01-05T03:34:38.843Z","Quite the Bat-set!","This set has to be one of the best Bat-vehicles in Lego's initial line. The design and shape of the plane are excellent, and the blunt-shooter is a great play feature. The Joker's helicopter looks just like it did in the Batman film. The helicopter has very cool flip-oout guns and can deploy nasty Joker bombs. Unfortunately though, there are no proper controls for either craft, and the Batwing can only seat one. I modified the cockpit because of that. However, it is pretty pricey, so try and get it on sale like I did. Overal a very cool set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Ant","2007-10-24T12:08:55.827Z","Stand for Batwing Made It","Great set, both the Joker's copter and the Batwing are substantial builds, and the models are quite large (Joker's copter fits two minifigs in the cockpit).

It being said that the Batwing is pretty large, the inclusion of a stand to hold it upright means it takes up a lot less space when being displayed, and it looks pretty good too.

From the art on the box, it looks as if a fourth (third at the time) batsuit was suppose to be included in this set - dark gray instead of the light gray included with the Batboat and Bat-dragster.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-04-26T20:13:19.547Z","ONE OF THE BEST BATMAN SETS","I love the batwing it's one of my favorite batman sets. The set seems to be based on on the 1989 film if I remember correctly. First the batwing: It can only fit in 1 minifigure; the grey-suited batman, standing upright you will notice it is shaped as the bat-logo. The cockpit has no control panels but it can store batman's gadgets (except the handcuffs). The 2 back wings can be clicked up to reveal secret weapons and the tail can push downwards to fire the spring loaded missile (firing it at the searchlight on the joker-copter will send the rope-ladder and joker falling) overall the batwing is pretty solid the only thing that bugged was just there was no control panel. Next the Joker-copter: This also a good model it fits 2 minifigures; joker and his henchman. the copter comes with a rope-ladder (as I already said above) which falls off quite easily. Like the batwing it has secert weapons on the side of the copter and you can drop joker bombs (2 are incuded). The Joker-copter is nice but there has been better helecopters. Lastly the minifigures: They are mainly based on the comics not the movies I really like the joker included with him are his BANG-gun, a joker playing card and a gun. The Henchman is pretty simple with just a plain purple torso icluded with him is just a gun. And last but not least the hero batman in grey suit, included with him are his tools. His cape is quite rare too. Stickers are included in the set too I don't really like them as they eventually peel off. I give it 9/10. If you do not have this set I reconmend you buy it before it is discontinued. ",FALSE,5,3,4,5,4
"uberpuma1","2008-07-05T12:50:23.793Z","Separate Models would have been nice.","Albeit I got this one on clearance, I would have rather not had the Joker Copter. (even though it is pretty neat)

I know there are all you out there that like the new Gotham look, but I remember when the batwing looked like the batarang, and every other bat-symbol out there. It was ROUND.This would have been awesome if it was ROUND on the wings, and came to an inside point like it should.  There are tons of pieces here that are useable for other MOCS, and the build is fairly solid (except for the fin looking wings that keep falling off) but other than that, its great.

The stand for display was a nice touch, but the price could have been brought down if they had packaged the Joker separately. 

Pros:
Tons of Plates and Slopes.
Nice Cockpit
Good design for what it is,

Cons:
Bad design for what it should be and isnt.
Joker ladder thing on helicopter is just weird.
Batwing should be the same shape as the bat symbol",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jim_Java","2008-06-25T07:07:07.217Z","Lego, get with the flow...","I got this set for Christmas, and while it has been enjoyable, I have a complaint about all of the Batman sets: They're acting as though it's 1997, or, even worse, as though it's the '50s!  We all know in 2005, the masterpiece Batman Begins was released, but try telling that to Lego!  They seem intent on releasing sets that give us, for example, Catwoman on a purple cycle, and Batman on a ridiculous Bat-cycle. I'm a little excited about the Tumbler, since it suggests Lego will finally be getting with it. 
OK, On with the set.  First off, the Bat-glider:

Pros:
-sleek, smooth
-Has cool backwings that bend
-comes with firing missile
-comes with launch stand
-Looks a little like the Bat-glider in BATMAN: THE MOVIE.
-Fun to build

Cons:
-Doesn't REALLY look like the movie glider-only a little, really.
-For a Lego set, parts of this aren't exactly sturdy-the small tips of the wings, for example.

On The Joker-copter:

Pros: 
-has a rope ladder
-includes Joker card
-comes with superbly cool missiles, and joker-bombs.

Cons: 
-The missiles don't fire
-The bombs can fall out accidentally.
-WHERE does the Joker get this? When does he use it in any of the movies? Honestly, a green-and-purple copter with Joker symbols. That definetly fits the definition of '50s cheesieness.  

Overall:  If this set looks cool to you, buy it. If it doesn't, wait till Lego come out with a movie style version of this. That will be SWEET!

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-20T14:38:41.2Z","&quot;Where does he get those wonderful toys?&quot;","This is one of the biggest and best Lego Batman models out there! Everyone who gave this set a low rating doesn't know SQUAT! The Batwing is a very neat design with the fold-out wings, gadget storage, and missile launcher. My only beef with it is that the wings are kinda fragile.
The Joker-copter is something else. It seats two, has hidden machine guns, and a bomb bay in the back. (Heh, a little alliteration there.) This set is a very creative use of pieces on the Batwing's part. Also has a display stand/landing pad for the Batwing that you can put in the Batcave.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Batmaniam","2009-01-21T14:01:37.733Z","Great Set, But I Didn't Get All Of It","All right this is a great set, but it would have been even awsomer, IF IT CAME WITH THE FIGS, AND HELICOPTER. It was really annoying, because I was so exited, and all of the bags where open, and no figs, and no copter :( . So the copter looks awsome, but I didn't get it. So I can only review the Batwing. Okay The B atwing is very sleek, and has a misssle in the back that shoots, and little guns that you push out when you open the wings. It alos comes with a stand that goes good with the batcave, to hold the plane, no reall flaws, except that I didn't get all of it, I might be able to just get the copter, and figs on ebay, but I don't know. Well, if you see it, get it, but make sure that you get everything. I rate this 3 out of 5 since I only got half, and the Batwing is the bigger half. :(",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I love the Joker minifigure and the guns he comes with. He comes with a bang gun a sub-machine gun and what looks like an oozy. Batman is also cool too. 

Pros:
Joker, batman, and henchman, minifig.
Batwing fires missiles
Joker's copter has hidden guns and can drop joker bombs.
Comes with handcuffs, batarangs, and three different guns.
Batwing wings can fold apart.
Little storage place for batwing.

Lots of stickers.

"xhunter94s","2010-03-22T18:42:54.653Z","My first set! Totally awesome!","<p>My first set I got it with some of my 11th birthday money (I'm still 11). It cost me $198 (obviously I didn't know about bricklink.com yet ;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The helicopter is bigger than i expected.There is a pull thing in the back and when you pull it two pumpkin bombs fall out of the bottom. The windshield is a up and down one. The cockpit can fit two people Two-Face;s van which can only fit 1.. Both propellers move. There is a ladder which is supposed to go in a radar like thing but I attached it to the side of the helicopter so it does not fall out. There are machineguns or missiles&nbsp;on the side whick&nbsp;fold&nbsp;in&nbsp;and out (hard to describe) like on Two-Faces van.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Batwing is the great part. The back wings which move up and down have machine guns or missiles too but the wings are a bit flimsy. the small wings are neccasary just like on the batmobile. There are these two things on the back wings which I forgot to add but it actually looks better without. The cockpit is up and down like on the batmobile ( I'm talking about the batmobile set&nbsp;because I did not really talk about in the review) and you must bend batman back (yep you guessed it, like on the batmobile). There is a missile that shoots out but I put that missile on the batmobile and made the thing that is on the missile shooter stay down so when I put Robin on it and go upside down or something it does not move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The minifigs are pretty cool batman is normal grey. The goon is the same as the other sets just a purple shirt. Joker is Jack Nicholson Joker ( my fav Joker actor, not to crazy, has a hint of genious and is good ol' fashioned funny!). </p>
<p>&nbsp;It is a great set, I would reccomend it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"AETerry","2011-05-29T12:35:51.09Z","The Batwing Review","<p>Batman....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name alone combined with LEGO makes for all sorts of awesomeness. 2006 &amp; 2007 saw a renaissance for me with my love of Lego when the Batman theme came out. I was still buying lego, just being far more picky about the sets or themes I was getting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As is the case with nearly all of the Batman sets, they feature vehicles that are often times one that Batman has used at one time or another in one incarnation or another from Comic, Cartoons to Movies. And if it's not a vehicle that's the big draw it's surely the featured villian that the Dark Knight is going after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The batwing makes for a very cool design being based off the early 90's Batman movie staring Michael Keaton and then later in the Batman: The Animated series. The wings on that back fold up to reveal some minicannons that can be pushed forward a bit. And there's a rear cannon the fires much like the forward cannon found in the Batmobile set. Unlike the Batmobile, I don't have too much complaints on this cannon as the part you push up to reveal it also sits flush with the rest of the design and isn't obvious. The cockpit also lacks any sort of controls or consoles for those looking for detail work inside the batwing.&nbsp;What's also cool, is that the batwing has a hanger for it, where Batman can climb up into&nbsp;the batwing&nbsp;before departing from his Batcave or another locale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other vehicle is that of Joker's helicopter. It's not a bad design, mainly purple and white. There's bombs in the back that Joker's henchman can release and drop on the batwing as they try to get away from Batman. There's also a rope ladder that Joker's hanging from as he's being airlifted away. He's holding too a gag weapon with a flag reading ""bang"" on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other set featuring Joker is 7888: The Tumber with Joker's Icecream Surpise. So it can be slightly redundant getting Joker and it boils down to really which set do you want to get. And in the case of a collector and limited budgets, it's one, the other, one first or the other, or get them both at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Batman of course may start to feel redundant far as mininifigures go as he features in nearly all of the sets despite a change of custome design he's got. The final minifigure for this set of course is Joker's henchmen and those are good to have around as fodder to fight against Batman with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, this is a very solid set, there's some stiffness, I've had slight problems with the wings and side missles breaking, but it's still fun to display and time to time, pull down to play or fiddle with. Batman fans and Lego collectors are sure to see this as a must have for their collections.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
