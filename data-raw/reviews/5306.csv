with 577 pieces and 569 of witch are basic technic elements this is a perfect bulk piece set.
of course thats not why i would by it but to each his own.
with 3 powerfull servo motors, 1 touch sensor, 1 light sensor, 1 sound sensor, 1 ultrasonic sensor and 1 intelegence brick, you good to go for any mad scientist expeiriment.
all of the things you can do is so fun that you can't even imagine it all untill you buy it.

pros:

many elements.
powerfull servo motors.
easy programing.
fairly scratch resistent.
easy to clean.
quickstart box.
and many models to build.

cons:

works better with non rechargeble batteries, so it's expencive to get the best proformance.
it comes with phone jack wires, that if not taken care of properly will brake easily.
and about $20-35 to steap of a price.
overall 4.5 out of 5.
