"Cashcleaner","2007-02-17T23:00:05.873Z","Fantastic motorcycle kit","This kit, to me, is an absolute bargain at $29.99 (CAN).  The two primary models are great-looking and a challenge to build, with some very interesting alternate models, as well.  I'm a huge fan of the sound brick included with it's engine revving noise, and would say that this is one of the best Lego kits I've ever seen when it's all built and on display.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Both are very detailed from the wheels and above. I praise the idea that Lego did this and looks very good in your collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I wasn't exactly thrilled with the technic parts being exposed in a Creator set. I don't particularly care for how the technic parts look exposed on a model. I appreciate them for their functionality and increased building options they provide though. That being said, finally I opened this set and began building the models from this set this month.

The models are truly inspiring and educational builds for those of us who are not used to building with technic pieces. The 2 books of instructions are chock full of different building strategies and techniques that I have not encountered before having primarily built with system parts. 

I have built 5 of the models so far and will build the remaining models this week. I will also attempt to build some of the inspiration builds pictured even though instructions are not included. I truly thought this would just be a provider of parts but I am enjoying the building process for each of the models I've built.

Not only are technic parts used to build at angles, I also learned how to use hinged plates to do the same. I can't wait to incorporate these techniques into my own creations.

The models themselves are pretty cool. Some have suspension so that when you push down on the bike a piece activates the sound brick and you hear the engine hum. The bikes that are predominantly one color look better than the mixed color bikes in my opinion. For instance, the 2 pictured with this set review are either yellow and grays or red and grays. There are bikes that are a mix of red, yellow and grays that in my mind should just have either red/gray or yellow/gray color schemes. A few more pieces so that this doesn't need to be should have been provided by LEGO. I didn't mind the wheels not being motorcycle specific but then again I am not a motorcycle lover.

I know this set is old but if you would like to learn new tricks for technic/system creations pick this set up if you can find it.
