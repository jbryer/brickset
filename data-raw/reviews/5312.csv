Then i realized I had twine! And pins! So I hung it from the ceiling and let me tell you, it looks GREAT! Including the very realistic posable joints, I managed to make it look just like it was flying! Great Designer set, well spent money! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-03-26T07:30:32.433Z","highlight of the creator-series","this is one of the recent sets i can recommend 100%. the dragon looks very well designed and offers lots of ways to pose.
also the brick selection is exceptional. of course lots of green is involved, but all kinds of bricks, plates, tiles and joints are employed, plus the electrical unit. the textile wings could serve as sails on a boat (are there boats with green sails...?). anyway, a great set for a fair price (i often see it on sale for an unknown reason).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-28T08:51:50.04Z","Whats the guy at the top on about!","i bet that guy hasn't got the set, the head is perfectly sized, he's only looked at the picture! This is a supurb set, many different models to build and all excellent! the one which is shown on the picture is my favourite and the light up brick is brilliant. and my main point is the guy who did the review at the top is completely wrong ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Deinonychus","2007-06-08T23:44:07.263Z","Here there be dragons!","The Creator line has been populated with wild animals and dinosaurs for a while now, but the latest entry into the brick menagerie comes in the form of the Mythical Creatures set. Mythical Creatures…meaning a healthy dose of dragons sprinkled with a few other monsters. 

The set comes with directions for five different dragons (one being the main model) as well as a snake, scorpion, and some sort of ogre/troll thing. The back page of the second instruction book also has pictures of five other creatures to use as inspiration. Now, to truly judge the quality of a Creator set, you can’t just build the models they give you directions for, you have to see if its possible to hack anything else cool out of the set, so that’s just what I did.

Opening the box and getting into the bags, the first thing you notice is that the box seems a little empty. This is because the majority of the set’s 588 pieces are small. Despite the small pieces, this set’s $30 US price tag makes it a good value. Sifting through the parts, you then begin to notice the nice variety and different types of interesting and useful pieces. You also begin to notice a lack of larger pieces like classic bricks and medium-sized plates that always come in handy while trying to build something. This set has a lot of green, which is a nice change of pace since large numbers of green LEGO pieces seem to be somewhat hard to come by.  The set also has a lot of universally useful black and gray as well as the shiny light brick, which works a lot better then the ones in the first-year Exo-Force sets.

And speaking of Exo-Force, with all the ball joints and sockets as well as some of the sloping bricks you could probably build a pretty decent Exo-Force style mech from the set. Even though that possibility was appealing, I stuck with the theme and started trying to build a dragon. 

I played around with a few different designs for a couple hours before finally hammering out a large green dragon with a body plan similar to that of a huge monster bat. Getting this beast to take shape from the parts provided wasn’t too terribly difficult, and it was very nice to have a whole host of little detailing parts to choose from. My initial analysis of too few large pieces did indeed pan out to be accurate, in that several times during building I wished for something bulkier and sturdier to click into the main body, but combining multiple smaller bricks worked almost as well. When I was done there were even plenty of small to medium pieces left over, which means I didn’t even come close to fully tapping what the set provided me.

I’m pretty pleased with the dragon I cooked up, and I’m pretty pleased with this set for the most part. It did keep me busy for a couple hours, so that’s a good thing by any calculation. Eight sets of building instructions, unique and useful parts, and a nice spread and variety of parts all come together to give you a very good set for the money and a fun building experience. The large number of smaller parts can even enable you to build several little X-pod type models at the same time if you cared to. 

 I do, however, have to bring my rating down a bit because of the lack of larger and bulkier bricks and pieces. But all things considered, it’s a good, solid Creator set, and I feel comfortable recommending it to just about every LEGO fan.

"Daniel__","2007-12-31T16:15:50.31Z","Dragons!","I got this set for christmas and I have built the main model and its HUGE! It is very easy to break. A couple of days ago it fell down and was blasted to smithereens.The small pieces are hard to find, though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-05-12T17:05:30.967Z"," This set is REALLY COOL!","          This is a great Lego set. It is part of the Creator series. In total this set has 588-pieces. 
          
           The instructions are very easy to follow. You can make up to 8 different creatures with one set. 

           I like to build some of the creatures from the instruction book, but I also like to take it apart and use my imagination to build my own Mythical Creatures. This set is nice and I have NO complaints!
           
           My favorite piece has to be the light up &quot;flame&quot; piece. It is a Lego brick that lights up. When you build the GIANT Dragon in the instruction book, you can move the dragons wings to make it breathe &quot;fire&quot;! 

           I will build with this set for quite a long time. I would have to say this is one of my favorite Creator Lego sets.

            As far as play value, I give it high ratings. Lego lovers can definitely play with the creatures they make. They are pretty sturdy and won't break apart without some really rough playing. 
           
            That is my review of Mythical Creatures:4894, and I hope you enjoyed it and thanks for reading my review!

"alva","2011-03-22T20:47:45.267Z","Great Creator Dragon","I think this Dragon is the best Creator that was launched on 2006.<br>Sure, as the reviewer before me said, they provide so many small and medium parts, and lack on the large parts. But I think, that is the plus point from the set. Using smaller size parts meaning that you can build a more detailed creature. Also, by using smaller parts, the dragon looks like he has scales over the body. So, I think that is a thumb up for the designer.<br><br>This is my pro and con for the set:<br>Pro :<br>- The main model really look like a real dragon<br>- Get a light brick, mounted in his lung, so you can make your dragon spitting fire.<br>- Get lots of green parts, that you can use for your MOC<br>- The body parts can be rotate almost in any direction, so the dragon can be posed in a lot of different style<br><br>Con :<br>- The wing spread too wide, so displaying this set takes up quite a lot of space.<br>- The fire that mounted on the pipe on the mouth is easily fell off.<br>- The alternative models doesn't look as good as the main model, so I never build any of them<br><br>I think people that can get benefit the most from this set is they who collect the castle/fantasy theme. This is a giant dragon that can serve as king of dragon, and you can surround him with a couple of regular dragons, and you get yourself an army of dragons.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

You can make giant scorpions, enormous eagles, three-headed dragons, and many more. It also comes with a lot of rare pieces if you want to make your own thing. It is just an overall awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Binnekamp","2014-10-20T00:31:28.04Z","More than eight  giant monsters, one set. ","<p>Although I have been eyeing this set for some time, but I patiently waited for a decent price because I knew it would be huge and I don&#39;t have a lot of room, so I made room first. Now I got it and it&#39;s awesome! I built all eight instruction models, and I&#39;m going to review them all.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There are two instruction booklets, each with extra alternate model ideas.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is a valhalla for those seeking green parts. Out of the basic colors the standard green and dark green included are the more rare parts, although most are easily bricklinkable, except for the sails/wings and the light brick and perhaps some other parts I don&#39;t know about. Some parts appear in amazingly high amounts, easily more than ten for many parts. If you are interested, go look at the inventory at Bricklink, Peeron or Brickset.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set does not include a minifigure. However, adding a minifig is recommended, adding a dragon rider is possible and you could make the models fight knights, they would be enormous!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Having built all eight instruction models, I can say that most of them were fun to build. The bigger the model, the more fun it was, because of sheer sense of accomplishment. However, all models, depicting creatures with limbs, had their fair share of repetition on identical limbs. All models were fairly unique, even the dragons were suitably different from each other and brought something new to the table, and I was sometimes surprised by new parts usage every now and then (such as using the sail for a loincloth with the ogre).</p>

<h3>The completed models</h3>

<p>I have split this part of the review in the different models, starting from smallest to largest.</p>

<h3>Horned snake</h3>

<p>The horned snake is the first model the instructions cover.</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s one of the few models that has upper jaw teeth.</li>
	<li>Interestingly, the neck is hinged and splits into two hinges, one for the lower jaw and one for the upper jaw.</li>
	<li>Come on, it&#39;s a giant snake!</li>
	<li>Bigger then I expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is fairly simple and doesn&#39;t use all too many hinges for its tail, which is a shame as it can&#39;t slither all too much.</li>
	<li>Unfortunately, the lower jaw is a bit short.</li>
	<li>Not too playable due to the aforementioned problems.</li>
	<li>In my opinion, the three headed snake alternate model/model idea is a better execution of a snake by using the ball hinges to make it more flexible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Green scorpion</h3>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Realistically shaped, with it&#39;s hunched tail and crouching posture and curved pincers.</li>
	<li>Fun to build the two halves.</li>
	<li>Brings variety amongst the various builds.</li>
	<li>Surprisingly, the arms can move hence and forth.</li>
	<li>Mouth parts!</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lego has a record of giving too few legs, but this ups the ante, because this scorpion has too many! Scorpions have eight legs, two of which contain pincers, not ten! Unless this is supposed to be a strangely shaped crustacean (with a stinger!?), this is just strange.</li>
	<li>Fragile, the pincers in particular.</li>
	<li>Not too poseable in the legs.</li>
	<li>The color scheme doesn&#39;t work on scorpions.</li>
	<li>The tail is too short to do any harm.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Small dragon (Wyvern)</h3>

<p>One of my favorites, it really works well on minifigure scale.</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Very playable. It&#39;s a flying, wing flapping, decent-sized dragon that spits fire.</li>
	<li>Well sculpted, with the right angles, hinges and shape of a small dragon.</li>
	<li>Swooshable!</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>The legs can&#39;t bend down sideways completely, they always bend outward slightly.</li>
	<li>Thick wings, although this was probably unavoidable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lizard dragon</h3>

<p>I thought I would loathe this, based on the pictures of its midsection and lower jaw. Surprisingly, this turned out better than expected!</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Very effective design. The toes are designed to bend downwards, so the claws actually nearly touch the ground for extra realism. The spines on its back are done well this time.</li>
	<li>Surprisingly poseable. The midsection and fore and hind body move sideways to make lizard like poses possible. It&#39;s just all around flexible. The hinged jaw actually made sense once I closed it: it&#39;s supposed to be like a frown with the jaw pointing upwards. Then the fire looks better too. And did I mention every single toe is poseable!</li>
	<li>Very playable due to the aforementioned articulation and jaw.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>No upper teeth. Closing the lower jaw slightly makes up for this, but it&#39;s still a bit off.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bipedal, lizard dragon and weapons.</h3>

<p>My expectations weren&#39;t too high on this one, but this turned out to be okay. Not excellent, not bad, just okay. Not shown on official pictures, but included in the instructions is an additional weapon rack which holds a staff with fire coming out at its top and which can hold the hammer as well.</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>This is looks and feels like it wanted to be an upgrade from the lizard dragon model. It succeeds mostly, but costs a few things too (see dislikes).</li>
	<li>It&#39;s full of character.</li>
	<li>Those weapons are a cool idea and the ball on a chain is very, very playable.</li>
	<li>Surprisingly long body, it&#39;s almost like a snake on legs curved upwards. This makes for a good balance.</li>
	<li>Teeth on its upper jaw!</li>
	<li>Weapon rack.</li>
	<li>The hammer makes wonderful use of the light brick. Whenever it hits something, it will emit red light!</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>It has a lot of segments, but it can only bend up and down, even the head can only do this. This makes for an inflexible body. Also, its claws aren&#39;t individually poseable anymore.</li>
	<li>The jaw doesn&#39;t open too far.</li>
	<li>The limbs are too close to each other and it&#39;s hands and feet are the same.</li>
	<li>The hammer and staff are attached by a maximum of three studs. This is fine for posing, but the sheer vibration caused by the joints will make these two weapons fall off. Actually using the hammer on anything is even harder.</li>
	<li>The spines are done badly, they are too irregular and look off.</li>
	<li>The head will always hang far over anything it hits with its hammer due to the long neck and short hammer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ogre</h3>

<p>A nice change from all those dragons, but suitably monstrous. Works well on this scale as some sort of giant.</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nice parts usage by using a sail/wing cloth as a... loincloth. Also, there is some snot involving the holes on technic pieces on its back.</li>
	<li>It&#39;s head moves sideways and it&#39;s jaw opens wide.</li>
	<li>Bulky, in a good way.</li>
	<li>Nice weapons. They work better on this guy. The spiked disk on a chain looks deadly, and the hammer is sturdier than on the bipedal dragon lizard.</li>
	<li>Once again very playable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>The loincloth slightly gets in the way of the legs.</li>
	<li>The legs aren&#39;t too poseable.</li>
	<li>The hammer still falls off sometimes and causes small pieces to fall off too!</li>
	<li>The huge front teeth only work when the jaw is nearly fully opened. They are a bit too large.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Three headed dragon</h3>

<p>This one I regarded as a B-model. However, it&#39;s better than you&#39;d think! To me it rivals my love for the giant dragon model.</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Highly playable. Perhaps the most playable model. It has three heads and will tower over anything that tries to fight it. The heads on the sides could grow back and fight for the middle head whilst the middle head is raised upwards and spouts fire. Or commands. Whatever. Or they each have a different personality. Or share a brain. The possibilities are endless with this one.</li>
	<li>Very posable. The wings looked weird at first, but it tuns out that they can fold in for when not in use, making use of the flexible material from the wings.</li>
	<li>Light brick for your daily fire breathing. Its activated by sliding a slope on its back forward.</li>
	<li>The light cable can be removed easily so it isn&#39;t spouting fire all day either.</li>
	<li>There is a twist to it&#39;s three headed design. The middle head has the strongest neck and it is the only one that can move sideways. However, if you remove the side heads and their thin upper necks, you can fold them in. They turn out to be perfect sides for the main neck. The result: you have a one headed dragon! As long as you keep the first segment of the middle neck straight, it looks like a single body!<br />
	This adds a lot to the playability, as you can now fold out the sides, add the extra heads and it grew extra heads.</li>
	<li>The arms have great hands with very poseable fingers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>As much as i like the neck(s), the side necks aren&#39;t too poseable. They don&#39;t turn sideways and are fragile.</li>
	<li>The arms are attached to regular technic holes instead of click hinge holes. As a result, they droop down. A lot. They are definitely not the best part of this model.</li>
	<li>The wings aren&#39;t the most beautiful (they are functional though).</li>
	<li>The light cable is fully visible on the outside.</li>
	<li>This is minor, but the little toe nails are white cheese slopes and look weird.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Giant, flying dragon (main model)</h3>

<p>In the end, this model is why you&#39;d buy this set. The parts are nice and the other models a bonus, but in the end, you just want a king sized dragon. And a king sized dragon you&#39;ll get.</p>

<p>Likes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where to start? This model really is king sized. I knew this and I knew its wings could fold up a bit. But it&#39;ll still be huge. Which is good in a sense.</li>
	<li>The head is the best from all of the models. It&#39;s just like you&#39;d want a dragon head to be. Not cartoonish or disproportionate, but epic. And it delivers.</li>
	<li>Speaking of proportions, the whole model is well proportioned.</li>
	<li>Surprisingly, the torso is split in three to make a hanging belly.</li>
	<li>All in all, it&#39;s very poseable.The wings are perfectly hinged.</li>
	<li>The model even has a neck that can move upwards so that the dragon can tower over things while on four feet.</li>
	<li>Speaking of feet, they all have moveable toes.</li>
	<li>The fire breathing function is the best hidden and makes it look like it really emits fire from its mouth. Once again its activated by sliding a slope on its back forward.</li>
	<li>Even has a collar with a chain to hang from, 5972-1 Container Heist style. With practice, it can also be used to make a minifig steer it somehow.</li>
	<li>Makes good use of <em>all</em> the parts and uses nearly everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dislikes</p>

<ul>
	<li>You &#39;ll need quite some space for it. It&#39;ll look great on top of a shelf though.</li>
	<li>Walks on all fours and doesn&#39;t look too convincing standing on two legs to raise itself.</li>
	<li>Has huge feet compared to the rest of its legs.</li>
	<li>The hanging belly is fine, but straightening its torso makes for some unsightly gaps between some slopes</li>
	<li>The wings are so big they are a bit hard to manage at times.</li>
	<li>The collar sits around its neck, but it nothing keeps it from sliding forward to the hinge section between the neck and the head. It also gets stuck on the horns sometimes.</li>
	<li>The fire cable isn&#39;t easily removed this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Off course, these are just suggested models. You can make your own model with the other parts. But this being a set review, I stuck to the main builds. And I am glad that there are still alternate models present. 2006 was one of the last if not the last year where there still were alternate models, even on creator/designer sets. This alone is worth something.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, this set has something for nearly everyone. Giant monsters of all shapes and sizes. In my humble opinion, ultimately, the wyvern, the three headed dragon and the giant flying dragon turned out to be the best, followed closely by the lizard dragon and the ogre. The other models weren&#39;t bad, but just not too good either.</p>

<p>So this set has fun models and allows you to build big, green monsters and offers one of the biggest official dragon models yet. I must say I&#39;m glad I got this set. However. if you are considering buying this set, I don&#39;t want to push you into buying it. I just hope this review gave you an overview.</p>
