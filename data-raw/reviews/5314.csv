"Atlis","2006-10-14T06:36:13Z","Great","Very nice set, possibility of building 3 cars - Cabrio, Jeep and Dragster, all with perfect details - engine under the bonnet, boot, pedals, everything you can imagine and see in the real car. It took me 4 hours to build it from 900 pieces... ;)",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"quincy","2007-03-05T21:49:16.8Z","Pure Fun!","The Good: Most fun I've had building a set in a long while. Lots of details I didn't expect to find in this scale model, such as working trunks and hoods, plus nicely trimmed dashboards. The Sports Car and the SUV are both great and beg for Mods to be made to them. Within a day of building the car I was off to the local lego dealer to acquire more parts to build and mount weapons on my newly constructed car.

The Bad: The Drag Car feels like it is just a filler project. I didn't even bother with it.

Final: Get it while you still can at a good price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legolover","2007-08-03T19:23:35.55Z","Awesome!","This set is gigantic! I love the little &quot;Stick Thing so you can hold the hood up. I was please with this set as it had many a great detail. Especially the interior. The floor pedals, the dashboard, the little storage things on the side of the doors. Great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"scardo","2008-04-20T14:08:18.967Z","Mazda Miata?","I love this set. It has steering, opening doors, hood, and trunk deck, and lots of great details - like pedals, gear shifter and handbrake, chrome roll-over bar, third brake light, an oddments tray in the door, and so on.
I think it overall looks pretty like the Mazda Miata (MX-5), even the rear lights look like the original.
The only flaw: The steering attachment at the front wheels is not centered on the rotation axis, so the car moves a bit to the side when steering at standstill.

All in all, a great looking set with amazingly realistic details!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2009-07-14T14:40:58.217Z","One of the nicest Lego Cars","I bought this set last year and it was sitting on my shelf for quite some time.  I finally built a few weeks ago.  After building it, I don't know why I waited.  It is now the King of my car fleet.

This is one the greatest, most AWESOME Lego cars to-date.  Why?  Well, for starters, it has working steering unlike the Ferrari Racers (which I have collected).  The car is HUGE and weighs a lot.  It acheives nice lines using traditional bricks.  It rolls extra smoothly with a nice tire/wheel combo.  The interior is very detailed and goes a step further than the other cars I've built-- the shifter, handbrake, pedals, guages, dashboard, door panels, handles-- everything is top notch.  The trunk and hood also open to reveal even more detail.  And the best part of all?  NO STICKERS.  Not even a cheesy one for the license plate.  I mean, I couldn't believe it myself...

If you can track this set down, I would highly recommend it to any Lego fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
