First off the primary model for this set should be the Tractor and by the way it’s great. The “dune buggy” however is horrible and totally pointless, why LEGO decided to make it the primary model in the US is beyond me, it is such a “B side” I mean come on! The 8437 Future car was hideous! Why punish everyone again by offering a remake? Anyway, the tractor is very nice, with some great detailing and cool mechanisms.  

----------
Cost: 4 :  This set is very reasonably priced, I would also expect that this will be one of the great sets to pick up on discount, as I can’t imagine it will be a good seller this season with the “dune buggy” on the front cover.
$0.07 per element ($60.00 US / 872 elements) 

Aesthetics and Details: 4 :  The tractor looks good, with a nice use of the green and white elements 

Elements: Standard technic parts, unfortunately it appears that LEGO is using a new elastomer for the tires; they feel a little cheap, more &quot;plasticy&quot; than rubbery.  I also had some tolerance issues with the pistons and engine blocks, either the pistons are too big or the bores in the blocks are too small, either way the set that I have has some serious quality control issues.

Features / Details: 4 : Great mechanisms and cool details

Primary Vehicle:
Engine / Drivetrain: 4 cylinder engine directly driven from rear 
Transmission: Engages and disengages rear accessories. The actuation lever is mounted on the side of the cab.
Suspension: Front wheels have a simple beam axle suspension setup
Steering: “Hand of god” from top of cab, internal wheel is not linked; Fenders on front wheels also turn to maintain alignment with turning wheels

Additional Actuations:  hood/bonnet opens

Auxiliary Components:
Mower deck can be raised and lowered, “Hand of god” from the rear of the cab, the mower deck spins and can be folded up when not deployed

Build: 4: This is a fun, quick build, there are some very clever details and mechanisms

Overall the Tractor is great model and is the sleeper set for 2006

"jim2301","2008-01-06T08:56:58.153Z","More than meets the eye!"," There's a lot more to this model than you might expect. First of all it's a lot harder to build than you may think, and everything on it works. There's a functioning four cylinder engine, a working P.T.O which is controlled from the cab. The steering works properly even with the attatched mud guards on the front wheels, which is pretty accurate for most modern tractors. The attatchment is very good too and works properly when down and static during transit. A very good sturdy model on the whole with a whole scope of tweeking to not only the tractor but there's a whole miriad of farm attatchments to build. I tried to make mine four wheel drive, but had a bit of trouble with the front axle, but I got there in the end and it works O.K. Get one if you can, you won't be disappointed. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"iipsa","2008-10-06T05:19:35.327Z","Very nice set","this is best tractor LEGO build ever. My only complain goes to fact that you can not find yellow and red wheels suitable for Tractor. 
Set is easy for handling - probably best compromise between simplicity and usibility. I bought this set mostly because rear wheels which are great refreshment in LEGO world. Please make yellow ones.

I recomend this set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"DrZeldenrustig","2009-02-21T19:20:14.687Z","Yippy Kayoo!","First of all, I have not been a fan of Lego-tractor boxes except for the 851 and 8859.
But...
This is a really great build. All the technic is closely compacted in a very complex model. I really had a great time building it!
And as a very big plus.... I only got it for €49....

By the way: I cant wait for the 2nd half 8063 model. (It makes a great group-display together with this one!!)

"Batmaniam","2009-01-18T15:21:04.717Z","Awsome ","This is a very good set. I was suprised that everything worked perfectly, because usually something doesn't work.
Dune Buggy:Very good, I don't understand why everyone doesn't think that it isn't good. The chasis works well, as well as the boxer engine, the steering, and the gull wing doors. The colour scheme is good, and it is very hard to build. My fingers hurt for a couple days after putting this together, because of all of the axeles you have to push into place, and what not. I also liked that there wasn't any stickers. Very good and fun. No cons.
Tractor:Very good. A lot more functions (and peices) in this one. The engine is cool, as well as the steering, and havester type thing on the back. I thought that it needed a driver, so I looked around, and I thought that one of those old technic minifigures would work, but I don't have one, so I built a minifigure out of the Monkey Creator set. It looks pretty good.
Over all this is a great set, the dune buggy being my favourite for playability, but the tractor is the best for functions, because seriously how do you play with a tractor? Well the dune buggy is the best, also lots of good pieces. And the price value was great, because I got it as a gift.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mandalorian","2010-10-29T12:54:15.99Z","Awesome huge tractor","The first thing you notice when you get a set is the box. Oddly, in America the dune buggy is on the front, and here in Europe it's the tractor. The reason it's odd that the dune buggy is on the front in America, is because it was clearly designed as a B-model, with many pieces left after you build it. Oh well.<br><br>Building the tractor is extremely fun, due to its complexity and the fact that it is a challenging build. The parts you build from are awesome, and there's just so many of them. You get huge rear tires, and wheels of course, and many other interesting pieces.<br><br>Once the model is built, it looks <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">AMAZING</span>, especially because of its size. It has many mechanisms and gears, the spinning things at the back beying the main and most awesome one. By the flick of a switch you can turn them off, raise the whole thing with a different gear and neatly put them up. Except for those the tractor has a 4-cylinder engine, steering and tilting front wheels.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Great building experience</li><li>Wide variety of awesome parts</li><li>Amazing look once completed</li><li>Many mechanisms and gears</li><li>Good playability.</li><li>Dune buggy is also quite cool<br></li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Some may find the price too high, even though it's worth it.</li></ul><br>If you have the money to buy this set, why not, it's awesome.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"martiniman","2013-10-03T07:08:20.16Z","One of the best technic sets that invites to customise and create add-ons.","<p>Actually I was just looking for some sets with lime-green bricks, and found a good priced like new second hand. It turned out to be one of the most amazing Technic builds I experienced.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>I just hate the new boxes. With all the bricks being plastic LEGO, stop the environmental excuse and please use the plastic showcase again on the bigger models. We serious collectors keep our boxes anyway!</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>The selection of parts is good, but not exceptional. Nice big wheels, good set of double angular beams, many gears and, although a small amount, nice white and lime green parts.</p>

<h4>Aesthetics</h4>

<p>The tractor has killer looks. It is huge, looks realistic and has a very nice colour scheme (I&#39;m fan of the black with not-so-standard colour accents). It is a very well done copy of the modern Claas tractors with much attention to detail. I like how it remains good Technic looks (without tacky stickers) and still is very faithful to the real thing. Is has a much nicer look than the later almost exact copy with wrong colours, the 8063.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>The build is medium complex, and very fun. There is a large bunch of gears in the base and the grass collector is fun to make too. I was looking if I missed something to fasten the front wheels, but there isn&#39;t. They just hang loose. It is a very simple way to make the tires follow the terrain, but it feels a little weak. It does not get loose though.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>In the end, everything works very nice, the blades turn a nice speed compared to your driving speed, and the mech for that works smooth. I cannot see the troubles others have with it. The only moment the gears slip is if you move the tractor back and forth very fast. The steering is smooth as butter with a nice tight turning circle. The engine, although very common, is in the right position, with a nice hood that can be opened. You can even open the side panels.</p>

<p>But the best part of the build is that it is very inviting to create extensions for the Tractor. Even more than with my other inviting set, the Unimog. I added a front loader with pneumatics and I will be looking for making rear extensions as well.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/8284-1.jpg"" style=""width: 1419px; height: 944px;"" /></p>

<p>If you get the 8063, the functions are there for no reason: the PTO axle in the 8063 drives nothing, the lever to turn it on and off is useless and the lifting mech is also sitting there waisted. With this original version, they are all put to good use, and you can hook up your own trailer, mower or what ever you like with ease and make it use the PTO axle the good way.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>This is the best Technic tractor ever made by LEGO, it looks stunning, it is huge and very inviting to build add-ons for! Get one!</p>
