----------
Cost: 4 : Little bit expensive
I bought in sale for 70 EUR (standard price in our shops is 105 EUR.
0.067 EUR per element (1036 elements)

Aesthetics: 5 : Excellent
I like combination technic elements with standard city elements which makes this technic models  look like real and it covers empty spaces on chasis.

Technical: 5 : Lots of functionalities
Engine / Drivetrain: 4 cylinder, Crane arm movement in 2 axes, Steering, arm for stability, etc. 

Build: 5: Fun and fast
It took me about 4-5 hours to build.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-10T18:01:18.437Z","Took me so long to build, but worth it","I got this set for X'mas 2006, and it took me 12 hours to build. But the results were so great! It's very realistic in all parts and comes with functional outriggers and cherry picker, all powered by cool and working gear systems. The wheels are an all new design. Besides the rotating part, I didn't have any trouble building this at all. The cherry picker can ascend, descend and rotate 360 degrees. The truck also comes with a steering mechanism. The only problem is that the front, white part falls off too easily. Overall great set and worth the money. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jakelongdragon","2009-02-25T05:58:33.89Z","Challenging and fun!","This set will take you some time to finish but it's completely worth it! It has lots of various working parts and pieces which you can use not just to build the 2 models proposed but as many other models as you can imagine. Because the set has many different technic parts (instead of just a lot of the same pieces) it's really fun to experiment. I got this set for Christmas 2007 and I am still not tired of playing with it. I have re-built the set it to make many other types of trucks and engines, including a red-colored Mater (complete with the eyes and forward teeth!)

Note: My parents got it at the sale price so it made the whole deal even more sweet!

<p>I got this set a while back and finally got around to building it recently.&nbsp; This set is a few years old now, but it has a lot of similarity to some newer sets, like the 8292 Cherry Picker and the recent 8071 Bucket Truck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>The build was enjoyable but surprisingly quick -- it only took me about three hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parts of the build I liked the most were the outriggers (I like mechanisms that use knob wheels)&nbsp;and the bucket assembly.&nbsp; Despite the fairly high part count for this set, there weren't&nbsp;many complicated build procedures that I hadn't see before -- the&nbsp;chassis,&nbsp;steering mechanism, and cab/grill detailing were all pretty typical of Technic truck models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p>When the build is finished, what you have is a fire truck with the following set of functions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Steering via a HOG knob located at the rear of the vehicle. 
<li>Outriggers that may be individually deployed via a pair of gear-knobs located on top of the cab. 
<li>Rotation of the bucket assembly.&nbsp; This function can be controlled by either of a pair of gear-knobs, one located on each side of the truck in a symmetric manner.&nbsp; These knobs&nbsp;are hidden behind panels that may be closed when the bucket is not in use. 
<li>Elevation of the bucket.&nbsp; This function is similarly contolled by a pair of symmetric knobs on both sides of the truck.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These functions work OK, but I have a big gripe with the design of the bucket assembly (and this applies to the 8292 Cherry Picker and 8071 Bucket Truck as well).&nbsp; Every bucket truck I have ever seen has at least three degrees of freedom in the movement of the bucket.&nbsp; At a minimum, the assembly can rotate, the lower arm can elevate, and the upper arm can elevate independently.&nbsp; Some bucket trucks also have an extension mechanism on the upper arm for a fourth degree of freedom.&nbsp; In all of the Technic bucket trucks to date, the movement of the upper and lower arms is linked together, which greatly restricts the range of movement for the bucket.&nbsp; It would have been pretty easy to use the driving ring extension trick (found in the&nbsp;8043&nbsp;Motorized Excavator) to run two shafts through the turntable to control both of the bucket arms -- no doubt that would make a pretty good MOC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The functions provided by the 8289 Fire Truck (which has more than 1000 parts) are essentially identical to those in the 8071&nbsp;Bucket Truck (which&nbsp;has fewer than 600 parts).&nbsp; In a set with over 1000 parts, I'd expect a little bit more -- maybe a V4 or V6 engine or a more sophisticated bucket mechanism (as I described above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Aesthetics</h4>
<p>Aesthetically, the 8289 Fire Truck does a pretty good job.&nbsp; There are some nice details like the hose reels in the back and the aforementioned opening side door panels.&nbsp; At first, I though the the tires were too small for the size of the truck, but after having looked at pictures of bucket-equipped fire trucks, I think the proportions are about right -- the cabs on these trucks are usually big enough to dwarf the tires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Inventory</h4>
<p>In terms of parts inventory there is nothing really special in this set.&nbsp; There are only 18 gears, including the 6 yellow knob wheels.&nbsp; There are no engine parts and no special steering or suspension parts.&nbsp; There are no linear actuators.&nbsp; What you do get, though, is a huge, and I mean really huge,&nbsp;number of red and white liftarms and axle connectors, which certainly could be useful for MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>I would give this set a marginal ""thumbs up"" rating.&nbsp; I was able to find it new (with a somewhat banged up box)&nbsp;for about $54, i.e. significantly less than the original retail price of $75.&nbsp; At that price, I would consider it worthwhile.&nbsp; I'd definitely think twice about paying a mark-up for this set.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,3
"GrandInqusitor","2022-10-05T11:50:38.757Z","As my 6th set we get back to technic","<p>After dipping my left foot into system building I returned to technic build, sadly it was not a set I needed But in the love of fire trucks I could not deny buying it for myself</p>

<p><strong>Building/Parts:</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a fun build, but there is not anything special about it. All the features work pretty straight forward. There is nothing special about the parts as well.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>Its very playable set good for a kid and It&#39;s pretty strong. Some panels where gearbox switches are&nbsp;fall quite easily other than that it&#39;s a good build for play time.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics:</strong></p>

<p>I am a bit disappointed in aesthetics I think I am ruined with other sets that look way better.</p>

<p>In conclusion. I think this set needed bit more functionality or a bit more aesthetics wise there is something missing that makes&nbsp;it special. We really need a Technic or Creator Expert Fire truck with way more detail.</p>
