I loved this set so much that I built it out of Lime bricks and another version out of Red bricks. They look just as cool but they are not blue. Like another reviewer stated, the stickers in this set are not between parts so these parts can be reused. The headlights are a perfect style. This is very similar to the Carbon Star but it looks better because it is BLUE! If you are curious to see what the Lime Renegade looks like, check out pics of it in my Brickshelf Gallery:

Altough this set don't have a minifigure, this receive playability and don't losted useful parts. This car, blue renegade, have common pieces from this subtheme but in a different type of building. The plate of the wheels was used with another sets of the subtheme and old cars, like one that was a promotional from shell petrol. The design of the car isn't only a ramp, one line or curved shape, but this involves ramp pieces(the black ones in the front, to looks like with the glass of the car)or plates at the two sides. A turbo piece is on back of the glass part, was very useful to the theme to makes tunned cars, and still too for tiny turbos. The flashlights for the car are little ramp pieces under and few in the front of the glass parts. These contents are all useful, in all of the 49 pieces, and too is easy to build, when completed, this is easy to play with. Due to the size and shape, is easy makes tricks with these, and also a competition with other tiny turbos. Don't have why rate it low, this deserves a 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
