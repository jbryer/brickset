This set has the same problem as other Racers sets which is the stickers. The &quot;Police&quot; sticker adheres to the 4 1x3 slopes that make up the windshield. I can't stand this feature. There are many Racers that have this problem of going across the parts that you would love to reuse in MOC's but have to decide between using the sticker or using the parts. I can never understand why Lego does this. 
The car looks great from the front, sides, and top but the rear looks like it is hanging over the edge a bit too much. The rear is a bit too long. The stickers add a nice touch (except for the one on the windshield). The translucent headlight slopes and police lights on the top look great as do the Racers wheels. This car was redone ever so slightly in the Tuner Garage set (different patrol car # on the stickers). I am glad that there is a cop car in my Tiny Turbos collection to go after the other Racers.

 Useful parts like the flashlights for a car(too included on the set &quot;Blue renegade&quot;), the ramp pieces to make the glass of the car, the wheels, that were good positioned, that keeps a good space between the other pieces to run well, and the blue and red pieces(essential to any police set, more when in pursuit, like this), another too, like the black, useful to more than police cars, because was and is a very used color.
 This set don't have a police minifigure due to the size, but received from the size a good playability, one of the most perfect for make tricks, great races with more than one car in one time, and the building is easy, to make too different ones or combination models. All things that you think that frustrates can be replaced, like the plate on the front with a police symbol. Many reasons justify the 5/5 rate for this set.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

	I got this set at (I believe) Target at regular price, and like it a lot, considering it&#39;s a small model.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The finished set looks really sleek and nice after it&#39;s all done.</li>
	<li>
		The has those nice basic wheels of Racers sets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The amount of stickers for this small model is excruciatingly evil and difficult.</li>
	<li>
		I feel a bit cheated with the tile in the front.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set is a wonderful and small little joy to put on your shelves or Lego Storage Unit (LSU- not the school, though...), and comes at a very reasonable rice.</p>
