"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-04T12:33:59.223Z","Okay.","This set is an okay set. It's a great set if you need: A pirate, a sword, a padel, flag, or pieces. But arn't logs supoosed to be brown, not yellow? That's the reason why I'm giving this a 4 out of 5.

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-23T12:38:04.623Z","Drink up me 'earties, yo ho.","Sadly, all that remains of this set is the minifig, although I do remember the rest of it well enough. The raft is (whenever I say &quot;is&quot; I mean &quot;was&quot;) sturdy and a neat little design. Very simplistic as well. I like the pirateand his old-fashioned minifig look. This comes with a few good pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It turned out that, though small, this set could be made into alot of different models. Ps and Cs will show you give you can idea of this set:

Pros:
1. Though it looks small, it is very fun to pretend the pirate is trying to find his way back to a ship
2. The paddle and flag are good for a LEGO Island
3. An alligator or shark goes so well with this set!

Cons:
1. This set is a little key ring compared to the larger Krakin Attackin'
2. Could use a shark or alligator (Shark would be best)

This set does not have any special features, except that there are pieces at the bottom that, when moved, almost looks like the raft is bobbing. But I do recommend this set to any LEGO Pirates lover IF they do not have or can't afford the Krakin Attackin'

Parents, note: This is an easy build that your child will enjoy. Easy, except maybe placing the sword in the Pirate's hand. But still pretty simple enough. Good stocking stuffer.

Hope this review helps anyone who wants this set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The concept for this set is very similar to&nbsp;6234 Renegade&#39;s Raft of&nbsp;1991, but with a simpler design and fewer parts. Construction is very simple and quick, but its still a nice looking raft with those yellow circular bricks representing wood or bamboo floats. The addition of two boat stud bricks was a great idea, it certainly made carpet sailing a lot smoother. An antenna brick makes a basic mast/flagpole for a printed Jolly Roger. An oar is also provided.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This colourful pirate has a red and black vest torso, yellow arms, blue legs, a head featuring stubble and an eyepatch and topped off with a blue bandana. He comes armed with a cutlass and the oar could be used to whack Imperial soldiers too!</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I also owned set 6234 Renegade&#39;s Raft, compared to that set it isn&#39;t quite as sophisticated, but the boat studs help to make up for that. It is a very playable set that goes well with all the other pirate and Imperial vessels. The raft is big enough to stow a stolen treasure chest too. I don&#39;t think I broke this raft down for quite a while and had a lot of fun with&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p>
