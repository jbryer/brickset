The castle wall it self is pretty big, and is modular the two towers on the end can easily be taken off. The rogue knights come with four little siege weapons which look really cheaply made. The small catupult works all right. The ram is probaly the best looking of the four as it looks very good and works good. The weapons wagon  carrys ten weapons and looks nice. The seige tower just plain sucks as it looks stupid and anyone going on it will get killed. I think it would have been better  if instead of the catupult weapon wagon and &quot;seige tower&quot; we got one big seige tower that acually looked good. The pot works good plus another skelton is never bad. other than some cracks on the towers this set is a great 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It has 10 minifigs(I don't count the skilleten)wich helps build an army.The falling poky things are cool and work well. The calvret of lava is cool but who would be domb anof to put their lader under it. The castle can be folded up or strate. This set is one of my favorits.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
