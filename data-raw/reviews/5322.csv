"FellintoOblivion","2006-03-11T04:17:59Z","Wow","This is easily my favorite mech thus far. It doesnt stand much taller then the others but it is WAY heavier. Its so heavy infact that unless you pose the legs it leans forward quite a bit. The trident thing is also very large. Its taller then the mech itself. I love how it actually has hands. The only reason I didnt give it a 5 is because its so top heavy and it has the same leg joint problems as all the others.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2007-02-04T14:26:25.567Z","The best of the large human mechs!","This kit really brings out all that exo-force stands for. The model looks powerful and armored, and the color scheme surprisingly works well! The weapons are very nice; the gun is small but sleek and the staff very interestingly built. And best of all: the mech actually has hands! Besides the awesome model, the kit is LOADED with useful pieces. Tons of yellow slopes and wedges, joints, solar fins, and 8 robot arms make this kit an awesome parts pack (more than any of the other large mechs). Takeshi is again the pilot, but since he's still okay, it doesn't take off barely any points. Overall, Supernova totally rocks! If you have the money, and want tons of great parts or an amazing mech, buy this kit. 4.999/5 (rounded up to 5)

P.s. Supernova's alternate model (instructions are on Lego.com) is one of the best alternate models in Exo-force. I suggest building it at least once if you have Supernova. ;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"justrock","2007-10-28T03:06:45.28Z","Tall guy","This and 2 other Exo-force guys are the first sets I've purchased in about 7 years. There are a lot of bricks and parts I've never seen before! The arms and legs are great, but then you get to the main body. The cockpit is airy and there is no thought in the back. Seems a bit front-heavy too. The light-up part is ok, but I can easily live without it...which will be easy when the non-replaceable battery dies.
Still very cool overall.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cloud2296","2007-12-02T20:42:06.343Z","Really Quite Awesome","Everything about this was great except for the gun. I got it at legoland a month before it went in toy shops. A must get for all Exo-force fans. I never really understood if it flew or not because it had rockets on its ankels and &quot;wings&quot; on its back.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"uberpuma1","2008-06-26T12:46:20.14Z","Alternate Model Is Nice!","I will admit, I get Exo-Force models simply for the slopes and specialty pieces to use in other MOC's. However, when I found this one (very cheap on clearance $2.90) I couldn't miss it.  When I got it home, I began my ritual of sorting the pieces, and then I noticed the crawler on the back of the box. I thought it looked pretty cool, and there were no instructions for it, so it was a better challenge than the &quot;A&quot; build.  About 20 minutes later, I was looking at the crawler completed (without stickers)... Only problem was on the front of the cockpit, I had to use a different color than what the picture had... I guess there was a last minute change or something... But all of the pieces are definitely there to make the build.

Pro's:
Color (yellow designs are awesome)
Alternate model rocks
Price was right

Con's: 
A model looks too wide and not as &quot;samurai&quot; as say &quot;Golden Guardian&quot; (amazing build btw) it seemed like they were trying to make it look both like a tactical mech, and a fighter as well... They needed to choose one or the other.

Backside on the A model is weak. this is the same with most Exo's though. (shakes head)

and the last Con.... JOINTS! Why cant they give us some real technic style worm joints or something ... 

Overall, Its nice to have the pieces... and in a few weeks, Im sure that the B model will become a MOC and will never be seen again LOL

"GeorgeDexter","2010-07-20T23:54:28.903Z","A great display model, but Don't Touch!","<p>When I saw this model, (after it had been discontinued) I had to have it.&nbsp; Thanks to a popular auction site, I got one for&nbsp;a reasonable price.</p>
<p>The build was fun, and I love the design, though like others, I'm not crazy about the open back.&nbsp; The way the Exo-Force cockpits&nbsp;windshields&nbsp;attach seems to be rather flimsy, too.</p>
<p>The last piece was clicked into place and wow: an awesome looking model!&nbsp; Then I started to move the arms and legs into different positions.&nbsp; Pieces started popping off, especially the top cross-piece of the torso/frame.&nbsp; The whole thing shatters when you try to activate the light-up feature.&nbsp; Often re-assembling is&nbsp;a pain because new pieces fall off when you're trying to re-assemble the old ones.</p>
<p>These issues seem typical of Exo-Force, which is&nbsp;a big bummer.&nbsp; They are some of the coolest looking sets, but I give them low marks for playability.&nbsp; I definitely feel the challenge to redesign and rebuild this kit so that it hold together better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The axe/spear weapon is really unique and cool looking, and I love the articulated hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The B model (crawler) looks pretty cool, too.&nbsp; I'm going to try that one sometime soon.</p>

<li>PROS:</li>
<li>Really Cool looking</li>

	I got this set from Toys &#39;R&#39; Us when it was available there, and think that this is the single best mech in the 2006 line of Exo-Force, but second behind the Golden Guardian. It is as tall as the other mechs, but much heavier and much detailed.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The color yellow in this set is quite unique for Exo-Force, and goes well with Takeshi.</li>
	<li>
		The hands are excellent, and look fantastically detailed for any set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The set is extremely heavy for its size, and needs to lean on the staff.</li>
	<li>
		I sort of wish that the gun was attached to the light, maybe like a scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set beats all standards for an Exo-Force set, and looks very detailed overall. I highly recommend this set to all because of its high standards for a set, but a mod should be made for stronger legs.</p>
