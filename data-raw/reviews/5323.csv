1. if you are expecting the white lightning to be cool, change your mind, and go with the B model. That little white ship is COOL!
2. The walker doesnt walk.... thats right... his hips flex to make him look like he can turn his feet, but the are not joints for walking... 

As I built this thing (2hrs) I was really starting to worry right about the time I got to the knees.  I quickly noticed that they didnt flex... period.  Now, I will admit, with the structure of the legs, it wouldnt be too hard if one had the right parts to add in worming and make this thing COMPLETELY AWESOME... 

Another thing I will lend to Lego is that the useage of Black in this model is really a smart idea. If it were any other color, you would be able to see right through it. There Really isnt much there. Its very deceptive, however... it looks awesome once posed.

The alternate models for both the Bridge walker and the white lighning are amazing, and almost look star wars. Seriously Bridge walkers ship looks definately from the dark side.

The lights arent the same brightness on my model, but thats a battery issue.

One thing I absolutely loved about BW is that it was finished before I knew it was finished... it seriously suprised me!  His head is the last to go on... and I wasnt really thinking about it, but since you build it all in separate parts, it just all came to conclusion at once.. Really nice.

Pro's
Parts parts parts!
There are so many Gun parts!
did I mention GUN PARTS!
Tons of black slopes!
Two AWESOME black models!
The white alternate is GORGEOUS! but is not as cool as the stealth wasp (from stealth hunter)
Bridge walker has COMMANDING presence when posed correctly ... man.. its cool!

Con's
HE DOESNT WALK (yet)
from the back, he looks naked (no armor).
White lightning is NO match for walker... awful combo, seems like it was just to push the price up a little more.. I would rather them be separate sets.
Antenna's on the back of walker fall off and cat gets them... bad kitty

BW-1
Pros:
MOnstrous size
Tons of weapons
New rocket
Meca One with legs (if you read my striking venom review you'll know why)
2 Light bricks
Alternative Model

Cons:
Legs aren't very articulated
Chest is exposed

White Lightning
Pros:
TWIN chaingun things
Disk launcher
Alternative model

Cons:
Too weak to fight the bridge walker (unless you follow the comics)
Shoulder Armour blast doesn't work...
Disks tend to fall out (I taped the top)
Disk launcher sometimes hurts your fingers

Still, an awesome set for any fan of lots of weapons, or Exo-Force.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
