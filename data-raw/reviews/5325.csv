"aaron","2006-05-22T15:51:13Z","A fantastic addition to your collection, this great set at a great price ","Overall Value: 4.5 (cost+aesthetics+features+build)/4: A great Ultimate Collector Series (UCS) set, inexpensive price, fun to build, very nice detail, lots of useful slopes, rounds and gears 
----------
Cost: 5 : Lots of great parts, this is a very nice sized set for the money
$0.07 per element ($69.99 US / 1045 elements)

Aesthetics: 5 : This is a very detailed model, and looks cool, Even if you are not a Batman fan, this set is worth getting for sheer quantity and style of the parts

Form/Function: This is a mid sized model with great styling and subtle details, the mechanisms inside the model were a nice surprise and enhance the overall look and playability.

Elements: Lots of useful black slopes, rounds and arches. There are also a surprising amount gears in this set. 

Features / Details: 4 : A nice surprise for a UCS model
Engine / Drivetrain: 2 Turbine engines that spin up from the front drive wheels, the rear wheels drive the “exhaust ports” which spin 2 arrays of orange fire elements

Steering: none, however turning the steering wheel lifts the “bat face” panel at the front of the car to expose the Turbine fans

Details: This set is very cool when built; the images don’t quite give it justice, a lot of the design and form details are hard to notice at first and require building the model to appreciate.

Build: 4: This is a quick build, and it doesn’t get monotonous like other UCS models ( i.e. 10030 ) even though most of elements are black, the variety and way they are used in this model makes it fun.

"Monty","2006-10-06T11:56:34Z","Holy badly printed instructions Batman!","I have had this set since it was first released, but did not build it until last weekend on a rainy afternoon/evening. This is one of the hardest builds I have ever done, simply because of the quality of the printing of the 2 instruction books. It cannot escape your notice that most of this set is in black bricks. I am not sure if they are all the same, but on mine the printing was so dark that it was virtually impossible without the aid of a strong light and magnifying glass to see which bricks were put where – looking at the box pictures also helped. All this double-checking spoiled it for me and considerably lengthened the build.

The actual construction – plates on the bottom is very flimsy throughout – especially at the beginning, but even when the strengthening beams are added, bottom plates still tend to fall off whist adding extra bits. There are working features as already mentioned - rotating fire bricks at the rear and turbines at the front which can be seen through the top of the bonnet or hood if you prefer. The steering wheel (lifts up and down) can also be used (turned) to lift the batman face on the front, to expose the front of the turbines. I actually thought it looked more like a wolf, so left off the 1 x 4 brick in the middle allowing the others to move up one stud to give a rounder more bat like appearance to the bottom of the face. There is an opening cockpit – I added a couple of additional bricks to the hinged roof to strengthen it (e.g. why no 2 x 8 plate in the middle underneath?) and make sure the click hinge mechanism did not pop off when trying to open it. I like the cockpit interior and seat in particular – looks very effective. Add the “rubbery” bat wings and gold wheels with Batman logo hubcaps and away you go.

The final model looks quite impressive. It sits very low with minimal ground clearance and will only run on very short pile carpet or solid surface. It does not have steerable wheels, but I feel it is more for display than play. At 50 GBP I thought the price was ok – especially as you do get lots of black parts. I have bought another which I intend to use as the basis for a MOC Tumbler batmobile – project for those long winter nights. Due to the bad printing of the instruction books, and the fact it spoilt the build, and the fact that the roof itself and its attachment should have been enhanced I must knock a point off. I hope later versions have revised instruction booklets.

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-03-02T05:15:43.403Z","The Perfect Display Piece","This is a smaller scale UCS set than more of the others before it, but it's still amazingly awesome to look at. The build is obviously simpler than the UCS Star Destroyer, but it's still an incredibly arduous process. There is a TON of black pieces so it's incredibly difficult to differentiate the parts. The printing is more or less fine, but a tad too dark for the black bits. The details are wonderful, with the best collection of curvy pieces I've more or less seen. The roof is far too simple and weakly hinged, but I love the comfy-looking red plush seat. The gears are plentiful and nicely integrated into the design, causing lovely special effects like spinning turbines and spinning flames out the back. Definitely a whole lot of fun, and a great reward at the end of the hard build. An amazing piece of engineering, and absolutely nice to look at.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"draguny1318","2007-08-23T13:59:38.85Z","Awesome!","I was planning to purchase this earlier, but decided to wait and got it after seeing that S@H was selling it for $34.98 (half retail price).

Pros:
-This set had a number of pieces that I wanted in black (y'know, for MOCing during those days full of nothingness)
-Good solid construction, though the base (at one point) was really, really weak. Like break off when you touch it weak.
-Cool features, like how the steering wheel could control the front hood-thingy.

Cons:
-No actual steering.
-Instuctions that were badly printed, but were still readable under some lighting. 

I know that there's still some things about the set that need work, but considering that some of the pros outweigh the cons, and that I'm a Batman fan, I'm gonna give this a 5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"deepseadawn","2008-02-14T02:20:12.28Z","Holy Badly Printed Instructions Batman - Part II","This set was way cool and a very satisfying build for me as a Batman fan, but I have to agree with Monty that the instructions were dreadful. As with his experience, this build was the hardest for me of all my kits because of the badly printed instruction book, with little guidance as to where to place the next grouping of black bricks on top of other black bricks. Lego would have served us much better to print all of the bricks in purple with black outlines around the studs. So make sure that you build this under adequate lighting, possibly with a magnifying glass. 

Having said that though, the model is really quite wonderful and the many gears and rods give it an almost Technics feel. The rubber tires with the batwing hubcaps and the seat and steering wheel were my favorite parts. Unlike others, I was not disappointed that the steering assembly or wheels did not really function as my goal was to build this for display and photography",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Captain","2008-05-18T18:36:20.903Z","Awesome source of parts, and it looks great!","I bought this at marshall's on sale, it was only $20. They might still have them there with some other batman sets, it's useful to check sometimes. So, the set is sweet. It comes with the gold bat-symbol rims. I thought they were yellow, but the pictures are misleading. It has a lot of axle coupler pieces in trans-red, a universal joint, lots of gears, tons of slopes, a few jet engines, and more. I find the construction to be very solid, too. This thing has it all. But I do have a few complaints...it's very low to the ground. It's only got a couple of millimeters of clearance, and the corners and such get caught when you roll it on carpets. There is also a disappointing lack of steering. When batman is driving over a hundred miles per hour through a city, it helps to be able to steer. The one last thing that I don't like about it is the fact that technic figures are too small to fit in the seat. I don't have any figures that are big enough.

But overall, this set owns, in terms of the finished product and the pieces it comes with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"nmurray2","2008-08-28T14:48:57.84Z","great for the price!","I got this set when I was on vacatoin in ohio. I went to a store called bughlers and saw this set. It was $70 so I snatched It because it was a retired set. (I got mine augest 2008) I got home and built it wrong and then rebuilt it. It is a VERY big set for $70 and has some cool features like the bat-ering ram and th spinning jets at the end. Even though it does not fit in with my other sets (bionicle and star wars) It is a nice adition to any lego clooection. If you stumble upon it in a local convienent store or on a online auction than snatch it because 1045 pieces for $70 is a steal!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T05:45:23.95Z","Great detail, but a little edgy","I got this around Marchthis year for a discounted $30, and it was a great buy, but for a UCS set lacks a lot. The interior is cool, especially with the siding, but the cockpit lacks the luster it would have if it had some controls, aside from the steering wheel! The hubcaps are nice and add to the Batman feel of the set, but the flames in the back are flimsy and fall off easily. The overall design is cool, and fits together perfectly, but the shape is very edgy, especially the bottom (so try not to display it on a clear glass surface, ha ha)! The wings are slightly posable and add a great touch, and so does the booster in the front. The symbol on the hood doesn't look right, but I can't put my finger on why... All the mechanics of the se work perfectly, especially the steering whell moving the emblem to reveal the engines, and the wheels moving the flames in the back. If I could change anything, I'd add a steerign system, and an alternate control for the emblem; I'd also change the design so that the back wheels were on a free axis, controlling the flames. Also the cockpit cover/window could use alittle tweaking...
