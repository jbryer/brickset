"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-02-14T04:34:45.7Z","Excellent ceterpiece, but sadly not perfect","Every range of Lego has a huge, wonderful centerpiece that everyone is drooling for: this is it. First of all, it probably has the best range of figs, including Bruce Wayne, Mr Freeze and Alfred. Second, a great vehicles assortment! The three sections build method is wonderful, but I have to say the left and right wings are really very weak designs, although with great playability. The Bat-Ski turntable is my favourite touch, though it looks much better with the Batmobile on it and fits that craft too. The trophys, especially that ole' Joker bomb, are fancy, but do need their own &quot;room&quot;. All in all, a great set with a ton of MOC opportunities if you come across something you don't like.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-04-20T12:58:13.99Z","Dananananananana Dananananananana... BAT-MAN!","The Batcave is the largest Batman set at the time of this writing, and my personal favorite. I decided to pick it up when I saw that it included lots of pieces I wanted. I'll talk about these elements throughout the review.

The main set has four different areas: A laboratory area, a launcher area, a changing area, and a parking area for a bat-sled (I don't know its proper name). I will talk about the laboratory area first.

The laboratory area contains chairs for batman and robin, as well as a table that raises to reveal weapons. On the subject of weapons, there is also a gray ninja sword on a stand near a bridge to the changing room. A Joker Bomb sits in a jar on the other side of the lab. There are also three large screens with stickers that show the Joker, Two-Face, and a map.. Underneath two of the stickers are plain black sloped roof pieces, which I enjoyed getting. The larger screen's piece is gray and flat. There are more of these flat gray pieces used as a ramp in the parking area. Also, there are stairs leading to the parking area.

The launcher area contains, yes, a launcher. The launcher can fire a net. It also has a radar dish to represent the bat-signal, which is a very savvy piece. Unfortunately, the launcher is happens to be very big and rather ugly. Apart from some torches, an oil barrel, and a brown rat, there's not much else to see.

The changing area has an area for Bruce Wayne to work out, as well as a  spinning device to 'change' his clothes to those of his alter ego, Batman. Underneath the area is what appears to be some sort of prison. Torches light this underground area.

The parking area is basically just a large pad that spins around and is used to park the bat-sled. There are some black tools (I prefer those to the gray ones) hanging around to mend the sled.

Some small nautical vehicles are included in the set: A jet-ski for Robin, and a submarine for the penguin. The jet-ski is pretty basic and there's not much to say about it. The submarine is designed to resemble a penguin, and has an area inside to put the pilot. This is my favorite transportation device in the set.

Figures include Mr. Freeze (With a clear Insectoid/Ogel Drone helmet and a freeze ray connected to a black Classic Space jet pack(!)), The Penguin (complete with stubby legs and an umbrella), Alfred (The butler), Bruce Wayne, Batman,  Robin (with a yellow cape and neat black hair), and a generic robber. Also included is an ice block to encase figures inside, small brick-built penguins with revolvers, and the typical weapons included in all Batman sets except the dragster.

The main model is too open, in my opinion, but very playable. Along with the neat pieces, I'd say this set is worth the retail price of 90$!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-13T05:09:51.663Z","A great set, and completely worth it for the villains","So I've been holding off on this set for awhile, mostly because of how ridiculously expensive they get to be...but lo and behold, a Target clearance comes through and I nabbed it for 60 bucks! (which still sounds like a lot, but at the retail 90, not so bad).

Anyway, as this is my first review, I'm going to take a hint from some of the reviewers I liked and outline it...

PROS
-Penguin and Mr. Freeze figures are awesome--and exclusive to the set.
-Trap door! Sewer entrance! Spiral staircase! Bruce-to-Bats Changer!
-A much-needed Alfred
-The Penguin's sub is a fun design, reminiscent of the 1960's Adam West movie. And the little penguins with guns? Adorable/great. Part of me honestly just wants to build a penguin army.
-A zipline for Batman!
-Takes a good chunk of time to build. The batsignal/missile/net-launcher trajectory adjustment is pretty ingenious.

CONS
-As someone else said, the trophy room really needed its own...room. I would've liked a BIG T-Rex, like in the comics/cartoon, as well as maybe the giant Two-Face coin, etc. But the magnifying glass, katana sword, Joker bomb, etc. are still cool.
-Robin's mini-vehicle is kind of lame. Then again, Robin's kind of lame. But at least we get his figure.
-Bruce Wayne is kind of plain. Could've been a little more distinct.
-The main Bat-vehicle design is somewhat poorly conceived. The front part falls off pretty easily, mostly because it's hinged on very little to keep it on tight. 
-I really, really wish Mr. Freeze came with something more than his ice block (which is great). A vehicle?  Anything? He's by far one of the coolest (pun sort of intended) mini-figs so far, so I would've liked to have seen something else.


LONG STORY SHORT:
If you can get the set on clearance or for a cheaper price, go for it. Or if you have the money to burn, go for it. It's a really fun set, and as a huge Batman fan, it was great to finally build something other than a Bat-vehicle.

Probably my favorite set along with the Joker's Aerial Assault from this line.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Navalis","2007-11-14T22:53:45.343Z","If you live in the Pacific Northwest...","I found this set on the shelf at Bi-Mart for $39.99. Even if you don't have membership it's well worth the small fee to get life long membership. I don't know if it's on sale or discount or what.
ALSO for $39.99 was the The Batmobile: Ultimate Collectors' Edition (#7784) though I did not get it.

For the Bat Cave I have just three words: penguins with guns!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legolover","2007-06-13T17:36:49.937Z","Great Brithday","I got this for my birhtday and I loved it! I don't really think Mr. Freeze needs a vehicle though. He can just go inside the sub whilst The Penguin is on top. Penguins are cold anyways. I do have a problem about how the front is attached to The Batsled. I can't even pick it up without it falling off.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-01-28T16:36:21.67Z","RARE CHARACTERS","The minifigures are definitely one of the best parts of this set. Mr.Freeze's helmet and face are probably my favorite of him. His ice pack includes rare trans. light blue pieces which are only in a few sets. Robin is acccurate to the comics, as is the penguin. If you haven't already bought this set, the characters are definitely worth the price, as well as the detailed cave.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"_add_um","2008-02-10T13:38:14.373Z","OVERALL A VERY GOOD SET","So far this is the biggests Batman set and was my first batman set too. It includes rare minifigs (like alfred and robin) and the only minifig too appear in another set is Batman (although later this year Mr. freeze, penguin and robin will be released in other sets). It comes also comes with the bat-blade (or bat-ski), penguin's sub and robin's speedboat.here's pros and cons

pros:
* hard to get minifig (at the time)
* platform for the bat-blade (or the other bat vechices)
* good detail on batcave

cons:
* sub only fits penguin
* stikers

I would recommend this to any lego batman fan!!

Center:It has huge computer screens and two chairs. It has a compartment to put batmans weapons but the guns can't fit inside(instructions say that).The stairs take forever to build and gets very annoyng.Also includes a joker bomb,blue jewel,jokers fingerprints on brick,swordand baby t-rex. 
Left tower has a cannon with batsignal,net launcher, and blunt shooter. There is also a dock for robin's jet.
Right tower has batman suit transformer to turn bruce into batman.It also has a trapdoor to drop criminals into the prison which is pretty large.There is also a hole in the back.Maybe it was placed there to take out criminals. 
Parking holds ice sled and robins jet.spins in 360 degrees but often gets stuck.It can also be connected to the center.

"TheDarkKnight","2010-03-04T10:09:31.89Z","LEGO Batman: The Batcave","<p>ntro: The promotional image, as shown above, cannot begin to even describe, to touch the beauty of this set. It's so much bigger than you would expect. Here, I will detail what I can of its enormity, although I cannot stress its awesomeness.</p>
<p>Packaging: Why not start with the start? The box is unique, mostly because it doesn't have those annoying flaps that are destroying the newer boxes on back. Instead, with two slices of a knife (or two snips of a scissors), you can open this box and gasp in awe at the now fully-viewably piece count. The bags were numbered, and you'd better be thanful for that. You know that moment where you want to break everything in your room because you can't find that one darn piece? Yeah, that would totally happen here. Two gigantic booklets of insturctions and both have more pages than the average booklet alone. Also, a minor note, Batman's and Robin's capes both come prepackaged and taped in thin white cardboard casings, as does the net for the netlauncher.</p>
<p>Minifigs: Coming in with a spectacular (no more, no less) 7 minifigs, this set nearly completes the Batman Universe in LEGO with the exception of a few characters who made appearances in the videogame. The obvious highlight of the show, the Batman minifigure is flawless. Dressed in the Tim Burton costume, he looks fabulous right down to the Belt and abs. My only gripe is I would have pushed for more diversity, as this fig has already appeared in the Batmobile and Batboat sets. His alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, makes his first and only appearance here. With a snazzy dark blue suit, he's dressed fine. But that brings me to my object of pain stemming from this figure. The face. Heck, look at the Indiana Jones sets, Bruce Wayne joined the Nazis during WWII. Seriously though, I gave him new Robin hair and a flesh Luke Skywalker face. Other than that, this minifig is fabulous. Next comes his sidekick, (no not Robin) Alfred! Honestly, Alfred may in truth help the Caped Crusader more than Robin. I'm sure he's spent long nights monitoring the Bat-Computer while Batman was on patrol. On a minor note, he did fix that chicken soup that one time... Anyways, Alfred's torso is brand-spanking new and a breath of fresh air it is! In a world of mediocre LEGO suit designs, Alfred's torso pops out to say &quot;Look at me!&quot; and look at it you do. Penguin also has this feature, but I'll get to that later. His pants are nothing special, just your average light blue-gray. Now to my favorite part of this figure, the face! This decal is so incredibly detailed, that it oughta be outlawed! Yeah, it's that good. The balding black hair that wraps around the back, the French moustache, the cocky grine and cheery eyes, honestly when has Alfred ever looked this good? Next comes Batman's other faithful friend, Robin! ...No applause. Now, according the videogame's official guide, this is the Tim Drake version, however, I like to think of it as the Richard Grayson version. I actually altered my second Robin from the submarine set to look like Tim Drake with Red Arms and legs and black hips and colored his mask black and--sorry. Not much to say about Robin, same as the next version except this one's got Elvis hair. Ooh, and a yellow cape. Basically exclusive to Batman since only three people in the world were lucky enough to get Cloud City. I think Lando's had blue printed on to the back of it anyway. Penguin is also exactly the same as his next set, only this version has a slightly smaller umbrella with a black handle instead of gray. I personally prefer this one. Mr. Freeze was drastically changed in hgis next outing, mainly because of gun design. I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this yet, but he doesn't have the standard issue bazooka in this set as he does in the other. This bazooka is made to go into the other hand as opposed to any I have ever seen. Maybe this was by design and maybe it was just a fluke in my set. His torso is not printed, but is detailed by the apparatus only seen in the color yellow before now I believe. By the way, Penguin's torso and face are amazing! I love his design. The henchman is pretty basic, I think the bad guys owe alot of money to the Kaminoans for cloning them since they all have the same face. He has the same unprinted torso as Mr. Freeze but his legs are dark bluish gray. Finally, on to the next catergory!</p>
<p>Vehichles: The moving stuff for lower intelligences who may be reading this. ;)<br />
Robin's Redbird: Mediocre. Not a bad design, but not the best. I like it better than his new submarine.</p>
<p>The Batblade: The first original Bat-vehicle. Not bad at all, in fact a pretty nice addition, however flimsy.</p>
<p>Penguins sub: The headliner vehicle. It will bring a smile to your face. A great design rivaling the many bigger vehicles out there. Also, 1000x better than the new one.</p>
<p>Build: Very sturdy and complete and alot of details make it worth the while. Several rare pieces are included, such and the green mini-T-Rex and the telephone. The Bat-stickers are standard-issue but there is a unique fingerprint sticker that goes on a 2x2 tile under a magnyfing glass. I didn't know minifigs left fingerprints.<br />
Main Secton: Incredible, love the staircase and the swivel chairs are brilliant, although I believe Emperor Palpatine already had one in Final Duel II. THe Joker bomb in the glass case is nice also.<br />
Left Section: Pretty weak. I took out the Batsignal and put it on top of my MCU for Commisioner Gordon to use. The netlauncher and missile are still there, though. I'm thinking about taking them out and putting in a Jason Todd memorial.<br />
Right section: Just as good as the main section. Incredibly detailed, my only complaint is the hole in the cell. What's the point in putting crooks in if they can just walk right back out. The old AT-ST top for the trapdoor is ingenious and so is the mechanism that works it--so much so, that I used the tecknique for my Carbon Freeze on Bespin MOC (it's not posted yet). The costume chamber is small but I think Edison thought up the design, because I know I sure couldn't!</p>
<p>Closing Comments: I got this when it was available, and maybe you did too. If you didn't, however, you need to. I know the price is pretty steep online but it's worth it believe me. A very great and strong to add to your collection. :)</p>
<p>Final Rating: 4.7/5 </p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this review!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

"Dentarthurdent","2009-03-05T23:15:36.483Z","Let's put a smile on that face!","Wow. The Batcave. Simply put; it's awesome. Doubly so if you have the other Batman sets, as it is typically a play-set. You can re-live all those classic DC moments, whether it's plotting an evil scheme to penetrate the Batcave or simply chucking the baddies in jail. Mind you, the set comes with a massive jail, more like a chamber, for holding those villains and their minions!

The set, as I have already stated, is a must have for Batman fans - you get Alfred, Robin, the talking computer thing, (it doesn't actually talk, obviously, but you can use your imagination eh?) Bruce Wayne, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze and of course, the caped crusader himself. You can just hear the bustle of Gotham City when you finally put the set together, although I must say I was a bit disappointed in that there wasn't an alternate way of arranging the set, and the frontal view of the set is not actually a frontal view of the set, but merely a few gray disorganized Lego pieces. However, I was mainly disappointed because I thought it would be like Cloud City which has a nice exterior. So all in all, it's a great set, blemished solely due to my over-expectations. 

The Bat-Glider thing is also very slick and nice. The rotating platform's also a welcome addition.

Great fun and sure to put a smile on your face, so to speak :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

To start off, this has to be the best Lego Batman set ever. Heck, it just might be THE BEST LEGO SET EVER! We get 10 Minifigures (including Little Penguin Drones) First is Burton's Batman My favorite Batman Minifigure. Next are his Faithful&nbsp;Companions&nbsp;Alfred and Robin. Alfred is EXCLUSIVE to this set, and this version of Robin is too, but later we see he got himself a hair cut. Next is Bruce Wayne, The Secret identity of Batman. For the Villains we Got Mr. Freeze, who has a better freeze ray in this set compared to the one in the Bat-buggy set. Next is the penguin who looks AWESOME! He has his own umbrella ans Pistol gun AND Three Mind Controlled Penguins as seen in BATMAN Returns. We have a typical LEGO Batman Henchman figure for Mr. Freeze. Next we have Robin's Jet Ski Type Thing. Very Neat little thing for Robin. We have a Submarine for The Penguin. He can sit on top or inside and look through the&nbsp;para-scope. The Biggest Vehicle in this set is what I like to call the Bat-Blade. it has two&nbsp;Gatling&nbsp;guns in front, two bat fins in the back and a Jet&nbsp;Exhaust&nbsp;port in the back. The Batman figure can sit up in this vehicle. We have the control center which has a HUGE Computer screen with two smaller screens hanging off to the side. he has two big consoles underneath the smaller screens and a table with two bat-thrones in front of that. a big spiral star case leads to the turntable&nbsp;which&nbsp;can hold just about all the Batman&nbsp;vehicles. he has a bat dock for the Bat-Boat (Not Included) But it can also be used for Robin's ""Bird Boat"". Above that we have a Defense tower which some&nbsp;believe&nbsp;to be the bat signal, even though that would be totally pointless. next we have the changing machine. put&nbsp;Bruce&nbsp;Wayne&nbsp;on one side and batman on the other, spin it around and he ""Changes hi clothes"". in front of that there is a trap door that leads to the Jail cell, that can also be accessed through the main door or the sewer&nbsp;behind&nbsp;it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set while one of the larger sets and on the expensive side, is well worth it's price tag of $80, nothing was skimped on the creation on this place. Various aspects of this cave pay homage to different eras of Batman from the red batphone of the 60's Adam West Batman, to the big screen that's a familiar of the Animated Batman series with artist Paul Dini and so on. What Batman collection would be complete without this set?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've got 7 minifigures in total. Batman, Robin, Alfred, Bruce Wayne, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, a Henchman and then there are of course 3 lego brick builds for penguins. Alfred and Bruce are unique to this set and the only place to get these minifigures from. The other minis can be gotten from other sets, or in the case of the henchman, a variation of him can be gotten from another set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three different vehicles in this set. A small Penguin submarine, Robin's Jet Ski and then a Batman vehicle that sits in the area of the Batcave that serves as the garage or hanger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On one side of the cave, you have a set up for a dock with a ladder going up to where a batsignal and a next launcher are at for intruders, the other side is an elevator deal for Bruce Wayne or others to enter the Batcave from. Underneath that is what appears to be a sewer entrance that's chained off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The center of the Batcave set has on the bottom an area that serves as Batman's mechanic shop for working on his vehicles and then stairs that lead up to the main computer console. And there's just all sorts of details from the obvious huge monitor, the table that lifts up to store all of Batman's gadgets, trophies from other battles, forensic tools, red batphone and big chair for Batman to sit in as he works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is just huge and a true delight to add to my Lego Batman collection. The price even brand new when it first came out, while steep, was well worth it. There's really not much I would change out or alter with a huge, glorious set like this. It's a masterpiece of a LEGO set and worth it for any LEGO Batman collectors to get a hold of.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
