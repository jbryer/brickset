Bikini Bottom's own Krusty Krab made it to my LEGO collection and it did so on sale as well. I bought this set on clearance in order to acquire more brown bricks to have at my disposal. There is a great assortment of brown elements including bricks, plates and curved bricks as well. I also desired this set for the set of gray doors so that I could use them in my town MOC buildings. These are hard to come across brand new and for the price I got this set for, I did good. The tan baseplate is the first one I have acquired and i can't wait to use it. A great bonus was the directions to build a dumpster. The dumpster in this set can be at home in any city set up. The flags, Krabby Patties and various containers are a bonus. 
The Sponge Bob fig is by far the best fig in the set. His printed square body fits over the peg that the minifig head would attach to and he looks awesome. Squidward leaves a lot to be desired but Krabs looks great. Plankton is cleverly designed using a 1x1 round brick and his face details are printed on. The stickers to this set are a nice touch but why does LEGO include so many stickers opposed to printed parts now? As another reviewer mentioned, there are no windows or customers included in this set. It would have been a nice touch to have Bikini Bottom residents eating at the Krusty Krabn but LEGO didn't think of this apparently or they deemed this type of fig unimportant of financially a wash.

"Rgijaba","2008-03-24T12:07:54.687Z","it looks like Plankton and the kraby pattys are flying...","this is a pretty good set, and who wouldnt want a Krusty Krab in their LEGO city? so this one comes with: Spongebob Squarepants, Squidward Tentacles (hes an octapus, not a squid!), Ugene Krabs (or Mr. Krabs), and Sheldon Plankton. now, this set is laking it their lil hats that they wear to work, and plankton also looks way to evil... its LOADED with stickers, but that doesnt realy bother me, and none of the stickers overlap parts (i think). the dumster is fairly well made, as is the cash rgester boat. there arent any cusamers, and thats a BIG problem, that made the score go down. the kraby pattys are cute, and fun to build! the front looks pretty authentic, but for SOME reason, theres a basket out front. its a good, rare piece, though, so its okay! theres also a little desk for Mr. Krabs, and you can hide the seret formula under it, but on the TV show they said that the formula is at home, under Mr. Krabs matress.the boat doesnt connect to the main krusty krab, and mr. krabs is the casheer in this set, but it should be Squidward.also, there arent enough tables, but thats easaly fixed, IF you have the rare golden plate piece that makes up the top of the table... all-in-all, its a pretty good set worth getting... and a must-have for your LEGO bkini bottem!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Resurgam","2008-12-22T10:17:01.577Z","The Krusty Krab","I bought this set the summer it came out, being a big &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; fan.  I always thought that &quot;SpongeBob&quot; Legos would be dumb but I was proven wrong with this set!  Although there were alot of things that made it seem &quot;not canon&quot;, it's easy to change, like adding in a green floorpiece.

Pros:
* Easy build

"Quirrelthesquirrel","2009-02-27T17:36:34.763Z","""There's no shower at work""","This is one of my favourite LEGO sets. It has a lot of features for a smallish set. Spongebob, Mr Krabs and Squidward are pretty good and Plankton is cute. The dumpster is cool with the lid and it looks real. The Krusty Krab sign is awesome and the seaweed, Krabby Patties and ENTER sign are neat. The table on the inside and the barrel chairs are cool. I am not sure why Mr Krabs office is out in the open but it is cool how the KP formula is in his desk. I also don't know why there is a giant safe next to the desk but the money is neat. The counter and grill is cool but it doesn't flip the patties up. I think it is a good set and better than the new version.

  it comes with alot for a little set : a dumster, the cooking place connected to the cashier place, and a little office for Mr.krabs. This set is very great for playability it offers hours of fun. being a BIG spongebob fan myself i loved how accurate it was to the show. I give it a 5/5 for it being so spongy! (pun INTENDED!)

"legospongepotter","2009-11-17T11:11:03.14Z","This is the best Lego set EVER!","This was my first Spongebob set and I got it for forty bucks. It should include more kitchen space and a spatula and uniforms, but it's not a big deal. Plenty of space inside the Krusty Krab. Nice accessories like the kelp and trash can (cute). This set has all the important mini figures, the cheap owner, Mr.Krabs. the two employees, Spongebob and Squidward, that evil little guy, Plankton. It would be nice if there was Patrick for a customer but I don't complain. It's my favorite set and I like how it's detailed and just looks like the real Krusty Krab. I would recommend this to any Spongebob fan. I rated it infinity out of 5. But I had to rate it here 5 out of 5. So go buy this amazing set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legodude357","2011-04-11T21:45:49.767Z","A great classic revisited by an ugly rip-off.","I chose a blank review template because this set had so much in it, I wanted to divide it according to separate models.<br><br>I remember returning some stuff to walmart one day and went over to the lego aisle. This was long before I discovered brickset or was a serious builder. The shelfs were empty, which was why I don't like shopping for lego at walmart. But on the bottom shelf was a single set. This one. Being a huge spongebob fan at the time and having just enough to purchase this set with my gift card I got from returing some items, you know I bought it.<br><br>This was my first set EVER with a baseplate, so naturally I built the model and took it apart to build battle fields and buildings and whatever else a kid does with a lego baseplate. The building was also my first, I was used to buying starwars sets. So I was acustomed to building small ships and whatnots. With an open back and hinges on the roof for easy access inside for play, I played with it for hours and hours. There was a desk with a hinge to reveal the secret formula,&nbsp; and a safe with my first ever printed money peices.<br><br>Thise set had four minifigures. A cute little plankton stud type thing with a printed face. It also included a squidward with a basic lego minifgure head which I prefer over the special molded piece in newer sets. You get a mr krabs, and a spongebob. The only thing lacking is a custmer to 'sample the fairs at this fine eating establishment'.<br><br>The dumpster was really neat, and with an included trash can piece, I had a lot of fun making spongebob ""take out the trash at night"". ;)<br><br>The counter to order was very nice and I put it on the baseplate inside the Krusty Krab. The fact it had a grill on the back added immense playability as well. You also get three(?) buildable krabby Pattys, and my very first bucket piece to put them in.<br><br>In all this set was an excellent classic for me. At the time I prefer playing with my sets so all the little interactive pieces included gave me great delight. So far, I have only two faults with the spongebob line. There are no impulse or battle pack type sets for the line. (But who would want an army of spongebobs?!?!) And two, the second version of this set was so weird. It came with a car shaped like a hamburger, and overly excited minifigure faces. As well as the removal of the baseplate. Another fault would be no customers in this set. Those faults can be overlooked I guess, and I greatly enjoyed this kit, and I will always remeber it.
