"psilum","2007-10-01T04:28:24.467Z","You mediocre clarinet player","This set recreates an episode (&quot;Plankton&quot; June '99) in which Plankton sneaks into Spongebob's head to take control of his brain and steal the Krabby Patty Recipe.  A hilarious episode and top marks to the designers for incorporate it into a large scale Spongebob model rather than slap together an inevitable plain model without the inherent playability value.

I have plenty of Lego models and they will usually spend their days up on a shelf for display, rarely to be touched.  But not this guy.  Spongebob stands faithfully on my desk and gets loads of attention from every passerby who cannot help but rearrange his arms and facial expression or simply indulge in some of their favourite Spongebob quotes (I am completely blown away by how differently his countenance changes with a simple rotation of the eyes and positioning of the arms).  The mouth catapult adds to the fun and the open mouth expression is just priceless.

He is quite sturdy considering the unusual frame with the lone weak spot being the leg to body connection.  The legs themselves have a Technic rod running down the center to ensure stability and the feet prove quite adequate in keeping him upright save for intense wobbling.

I highly recommend this set to any fan of the show and it is not a bad buy for the pieces either (445pcs for $30).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lego12","2008-04-23T15:54:13.403Z","  Akward set......"," This set is akward even though I have seen the episode. Let me give you the pros and cons of this set....

  -----------
      Pros
 1. It isn't small it's bigger than I thought.
 2. The controls in the head are cool.
 3. The posters(stickers) are interesting.
 4. The shooting bubbles mechanism is well done.
 5. The way you can move Spongebob's eyes and change his mouth is neat.

  -----------
      Cons
 1. His legs aren't sturdy so he bends forward a little and gradually falls downs.
 2. The bubble holder is weak and the bubbles fall out.
 3. When you try to change his mouth out you may accidentally pull out the bubble shooter because it is poorly built.

 That's my review and I hope it helped you to decide to buy this item or not.
