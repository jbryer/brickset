Some of the other stuff here is quite good but the problem is it's just a bunch of things. It would be nicer if it was one well-designed model ... but basically it's lots of different bits and bobs. On the other hand i totally love the jellyfish, and you get a lot of them, which is nice.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LEGOmyeggo","2007-08-26T08:59:28.41Z","Not worth the $40 USD my brother Nathaniel paid for it..","The whole thing with LEGO is that on the boxes, they use a backround and enlarge stuff to make it look bigger and better than it really is. I would only pay $25 USD for it. The big thing is SpongeBob's house, the pineapple! The litle boat and jellyfish is nice. Squidward's tiki-like house needs to have his room where he plays his clarinet (and that should be in it), and Spongebob's needs his kitchen where he feeds Gary and his living room. The minifigs are good, except Gary's eyes should be different. And Patrick's rock is a half-circle, not a cave!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-29T23:33:33.81Z","Ooooohhh, Who Lives in a Pineapple Under the Sea.? Sponge Bob Sqaure Pants!","I loved, absolutely loved building this set! I will start with what I didn't care for so that I can end on a positive note.
-Squidward's house was only OK. It leaves you wanting for more (which fortunately you    
 can expand this house on your own because it is LEGO).
-Patrick's house is a mound and brown in the cartoon but this set has it as a gray rock 
 formation

Now on to why I loved building this set:
-the main color is orange. This set is a great way to add to your orange brick stock.   
 The orange bricks are inverted slopes, 1x1, 1x2, 1x4 and 1x6 bricks, 1x2, 1x4, 1x6 and 
 2x4 plates, wing plates, and 75x2x1x3 slope bricks both regular and inverted. As you 
 can see this set provides you with more than just your common 1x2 bricks.
-the boat car has a pull back motor
-there are 4 clear 1x4x3 panels that can be used as windows for MOC's
-the pineapple is shaped beautifully and uses hinge plates and hinge bricks 
 intelligently to create the shape of the pineapple
-Patrick's house (although in the wrong color and shape) is cool. It opens and closes 
 and inside is a TV, chair, table and cup and on top is a TV antenna 
-Sponge Bob's bed is functional and can launch him up in the air
-3 minifigs are included as is a &quot;minifig&quot; of Gary
-tan bricks and plates are included as well

In summation, this is a great set as is. It scores high for piece selection and color as well. Orange and tan are not the most common colored elements in my collection and I was happy to add these colored bricks to my collection. I will be dismantling this set tomorrow after just having built it today so that I can sort and store the bricks with the rest of my collection. I enjoyed the show in the past but really bought the set for the orange elements and am glad that I actually built this set before I put the parts with the rest of my collection. I can definitely see a kid having fun with this set as there are a lot of moving parts (boat car, bed, catapults, etc.) and minifigs based on characters from one of the most popular cartoons on TV today.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MattieG7","2008-03-23T15:10:58.78Z","Excellent","I absolutely loved this set, with it being SpongeBob &amp; LEGO mixed together! Building took about 30 mins as I am experienced with building with LEGO (I can build Squidward's hoouse in no more then 3 mins). Gary could have had eyes, though. But it says that a TV is included, but a TV didn't come with it, unless it means Patrick's TV. Overall, a very good set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-06-18T16:36:08.06Z","&quot;If Nautical Nonsense Be Something You Wish&quot;","SpongeBob is my all time favorite cartoon show. When I learned LEGO was going to be releasing them in brick form, I knew I had to get one.

Pros:
3 mini figs. SpongBob, Patrick, and Squidward. 
Extra things like Gary the snail, and jellyfish
Motorboat. Pull it back, let go, and it actually moves
Jelly fish carrier.
Spongebob's home. Bed, basket ball hoop with basketballs, opening door. lots of pieces.
Squidwards Home.
Patricks home. TV, chair, table, and antennae on the outside. Not much, but it's fun to play with anyway.  
2 catapults. One for spongebob and one for squidward. they actually work

Cons:
Squidwards house should have had more interior space and decorating, but it's still expandable with your own legos.

this is an expensive set, but I'd say it's probably worth it. It's fun to build and share the fun with others.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-07-03T23:42:14.263Z","orange pineapple is a winning concoction!","i bought this set because the orange pineapple stood out from among the many sets at the lego shop, and i thought to myself, why not!? i am a city builder but i also want to build a sponge bob theme park for the kids in the lego neighbourhood: it is not just a fun playable set for me but also for the mini-figures in the city. imagine all the mini-figures coming to this theme park on weekends to take photos with bob and eject jellyfish! i also bought the bikini bottom express as i felt they should come together to make my theme park complete. they are both orange! it is not a complete orange pineapple because the back is open like any lego city building sets out there. that is not much of a problem as you can have 2 orange pineapple sets to join them both together to make a complete round building. this set is just wonderful fun to have around.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-01-16T19:39:04.967Z","Good Old Bikini Bottom","This is one of those sets that you can play with for hours. The houses are very cool, but Squidward's house needs a little more work. You get alot of minifigures in this set like Patrick, Squidward, Gary, and the infamous Spongebob Squarepants. Overall, this is a great set and should be picked up somwhere.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T13:38:11.59Z","Classic spongebob","If you are a hard-core spongbob and lego fan like me, than this is perfect for you! I do not completey understand why there is a basketball hoop in my spongebob pinapple but it is a nice addition. The LEGO people who made this set were very clever with Gary. Also, I do not understand why there is a car with the set, because Patrick never drove a car in the classic episodes, Squidward rode on a bike, and Spongebob of course never got his driver's liscence. I like the frame on Squidward's house and the TV in Patrick's house! Overall, the value for your money is above-average and the minifigures are greatly designed for LEGO minifigures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2009-02-09T17:39:59.513Z","A passing theme, despite it's popularity.","Overall, the Spongebob theme was O.K., and O.K. only. I appreciate Lego going out of the way to model the Spongebob, Patrick, Sandy, and Mrs. Puff minifigs to look realistic.

Good:
Captain's Wheel
Easter Island Head (Squidward's house)
Two Cave/Mountain pieces (Patrick's rock house)
Pineapple (Spongebob's house)
Jellyfish Launcher
Jellyfish Catcher
Patrick's Boat
Spongebob
Patrick
Squidward
Jellyfish Mobile Cart
T.V. Box (2 dot bulk-brick)
Basketball?
Gary's Design is cool

Bad:
Not to scale (Squidward's house should be larger than Spongebob)

Overall:
4.3/5
OR
9.3/10

"Quirrelthesquirrel","2009-07-04T01:25:25.5Z","Squidward wants to play with them!?","This is a neat set for all of the features it has.<br/><br/>Spongebob's pineapple<br/>On the outside, it looks just like in the show. On the inside, now theres a question. Why does Spongebob have a basketball court inside his house? Or a bed for Patrick when theres a sleepover? And where's the couch that Gary is always chewing? <br/>8/10<br/><br/>Squidward tiki house<br/>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh! That's meant to be Squidward's house! Looks more like a wall. There is nothing in the house, it's grey, it's to small and the only thing it does it get it's windows smashed. <br/>6/10<br/><br/>Patrick's rock<br/>This would be hard to design, but LEGO did a good job. Okay, so it's weird, who cares. It's what's on the inside that counts or something. You get a chair, a cup and a T.V.! The aerial is also good.<br/>7/10<br/><br/>Vehicles<br/>Boat<br/>It's is very well designed but why is Patrick, of all people, driving it! The pull-back function is also good. 8/10<br/>Tank<br/>How did Spongebob and Patrick catch 8 jellyfish? Anyways, this is poorly designed because the jellyfish can escape. 4/10<br/><br/>Catapults<br/>The catapults in this set are weird because Squidward doesn't like playing and his catapult is poorly made. 3/10<br/>Spongebob's is okay and the net can detach from the catapult! 5/10",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patrick's House:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside Patrick's House Is Simple But awesome You Have A Table,A Cup Of Coffee And A TV Which Ive Never Seen In Any&nbsp;Other Set So The TV Is&nbsp;Pretty Rare ON top OF patrick's House You Have An Areial Which Is Pretty Cool</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Expeirence:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Set Has 2 Numbered Bags, 1 is For Everything But Spongebob's House And 2 Is Of Course Is For Spongebob's House. The Set Takes Around 40 Miniutes To Build And Was Quite An Easy Build For Me Even Though I Was New To LEGO At The Time<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Set Has Some Very Interesting Parts Such As The 2 rocks That Make Patrick's House, The TV In Patrick's House, The Tiki Peice In Squidward's House And The 2 Basketballs And Hoops You Get With Spongebob's House</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Playability Is Outstanding There is So Many Things You Can Do With It The Main Feature Of the Set Is That You can Recreate Or You Can Make Your Own Scence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vaule For Money:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Original RRP Price For This Was £35 Which Was Excellent Vaule I Got Mine For £40 On eBay And It Was Worth Every Penny. The Only Problem Was That I Couldnt Find This Set ANYWHERE In The UK So I Had To Import From The US</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
