"The_Bricks_Imports","2006-11-26T18:10:41Z","Um modelo espetacular, que deixou a desejar!","Lindo &#233; a palavra que vc pode descreve-lo! 

eu gostei das seguintes coisas(GOOD):

1 - Desing

espetacular, muito bonito esse trem! lembra o ICE Alem&#227;o!

2 - Controle Remoto (Remote Control)

bastante &#250;til, imagino que se pode usa-lo em 3 trens simultaneamente, pois tem 3 canais!

3 - Som da Locomotiva (Sound of the Locomotive)

a mesma emite um som que parece um trem de verdade, essa &#233; uma coisa que falta nos trens 9V!



mas infelizmente deixou a desejar nos seguintes aspectos(BAD):

1 -  Pe&#231;as (Pieces)

a pe&#231;a da cabine tem 1 falha na jun&#231;&#227;o com o restante da locomotiva(eu tive que colocar um adesivo da cor branca, vejam no link:  http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115462  http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115457 ) como tambem as pe&#231;as que formam o teto do restante da locomotiva s&#227;o grandes e praticamente o corredor &#233; cortado pelas mesmas(prefiro as pe&#231;as do teto do 4558 - METROLINER), retirei tambem o pequeno container lateral da locomotiva principal, pois o mesmo nao tem nada haver, dai recuperei espa&#231;o interno!!!

2 - Cockpit 

o cockpit desse modelo &#233; muito pobre em relacao as tiras e declives decorados(dai tive que dar um toque especial nessa parte, vejam as fotos: http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115537    http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115463   http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115465   http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115485   http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=2115487   )

3 - Bonecos (Minifig)

vem somente 3 bonecos(muito pouco pra esse modelo)!

"kumyen","2007-03-06T01:52:34.103Z","FUN","Its a good set to play with.

But after construction I found out that there is a big gap within the train head and the body. 
After complaining to LEGO group they say it is designed.

Besides, 6 batteries needed to make the train run.
Carrying 6 batteries is a lot of burden.
Batteries will easily used up.

After all these years LEGO should make rechargeable battery for their own sets. 
Rather than using AA batteries.

After adding all the addition tracks to it..
You will find that the station is very small..

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-14T09:47:35.327Z","Great set!","This set is a great set but i still would have liked to have had an rc version. the set plays well and the mini figures are all great. One concern i would like to point out is that the front pieces on the trains tend to fall of so I secure them with a 2x3 piece at the top. Also some longer track should come with the set so you can turn it into a real train system. But overall GREAT SET!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Beren","2007-07-07T17:45:53.95Z","Good Set But Faulty Design","This could have been an excellent set. I like the general shape of the train. The RC unit works much better than I would have thought and I haven't managed to derail the train despite going fast and through twisty switched tracks. The issue is that the nose sections of the train are made from one solid piece (+ window section) that doesn't line up. Other reviewers have mentioned this, so I assume it is a  universal problem.

I would still buy it again even if I knew about the fault. I just can't understand how Lego let this go into production like it did.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-09-19T22:35:15.107Z","Other uses.","This set rocks,the only problem is lego made this set and threw it away like trash, not making separate engines you could buy or anything. It looks good,goes kinda slow but has a nice interior and a cool remote. it runs on like 12 batteries so it ends up being expensive. Id reccomend the 9vt, it can go really fast and is easy to build up into 1 big train.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"ronbonne","2007-10-17T14:22:00.047Z","As cheap as it gets.","Rarely ever do I buy/open/build a Lego set and end up disappointed. However, this is one of those rare cases. This train set has &quot;cheap&quot; written all over it. Here's why:

- Train fronts are single-piece and badly designed (huge gaps where they line up with the sides of the train, a very weak attachment, clumsy holder for the light prism and it needs 5 stickers per front to make it look halfway acceptable.
- Interior is very spartan; a far cry from train interiors like in the Metroliner and the Santa Fe cars
- The passenger platform is pretty much a joke.
- Very little detail anywhere... (compared to pretty much any other train set Lego ever put out).

The only reason I did not rate this set &quot;1&quot; is because it does have a good selection of usefull parts and I found the IR remote control actually quite pleasant (this is my first RC train set; the 7898 freight train is next).",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-03-03T00:36:18.077Z","Some useful pieces, but an ugly train which isn't a patch on the old ones.","Given that second-hand Lego trains of old are so scandalously expensive, it's a real shame that this recent model is so lacking.  The technology is sound enough, and there are a lot of useful pieces, but the train itself is utterly ugly.  There's the usual large pre-fabricated pieces which seem to be the curse of so many recent Lego sets, there's far too little detail inside the train and it just looks tacky.  There's also the issue of the far-too-small station.  Apart from anything else, do the people hop up onto the platform like crickets?  I can find no other way for them to get up there.  Lego would be better off re-releasing some of the old, far superior, trains rather than turning out junk like this.

"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-12-29T14:11:09.06Z","Not as good as it looks","<p>I got this set for Christmas and loved it at first.&nbsp;Nothing like seeing the train go around in circles with the headlights on. The set comes with three sleek, individual cars joined together with magnets. The front car has a motor, battery box, and working lights. It also includes tables, chairs and cups inside. There are 16 curved rails and 4 straight ones. There is a remote controller, with 7 speeds in each direction, stop button, and horn toot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my love for the train began to drop. I created an elevated train for my city, and whenever the train runs, it would shake the table which my city is on,&nbsp;causing the taller buildings to shake. This is due to the heavyness of the train. Requiring 6 AA batteries I'm not surprised, and on top of that, a large motor box. Because of this, the train can't make turns on speed 1 and will barely move on turns on speed 2. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, I thought this was a very good train kit. But quite frankly I want to buy the newer 7938 Passenger Train, because others say that the motor is much stronger, making the train go faster. It also uses AAA batteries so I'm very sure that the new train is lighter than this one.</p>",TRUE,3,3,4,5,4
"jjr","2009-04-25T04:21:05.797Z","cool, but some lacks","I bhought this train because I liked the design of it. Clearly its a combination of the ICE 3 train from Germany and the TGV from France. 

when I bhought this set it was 85 euro, cheap for a train

At home I build the train, the thing I don't like (;ike almost all of you) are the big front pieces, I like their design but they look like they can break very easily.  

the rest of the building is nothing to advanced, pretty simple.

The train was finished and the first thing I noticed was the enormous ammount of battery's needed to drive the train. 

I already made the largest track ever on my room for this train. I needed to modify the curves because the front sticks out to far. 

the train makes not that much sound as the 9v did. 

overall: I like this set, but it could be a little better,",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2009-07-04T17:25:52.967Z","Nice train, but with its own drawbacks","<p>I bought this set some time ago, as I was really in need of a train in my Lego Town. Before that I asked many people about this set, I also watched the video about the creation of this train. It looked impressive.<br />
<br />
Though I did enjoy building this train, I still believe that other trains (especially <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7745-1/High-Speed-City-Express-Passenger-Train-Set"">7745</a> (1985) and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4558-1/Metroliner"">4558</a> (1991)) were even better. This one has evident &quot;flaws&quot; like a small hole in the cabin, only 3 figures, not a very interesting station, the inside could be better as well. But it&#39;s still fun to play.<br />
<br />
Eventually I modified it a bit, so the toy becomes more &quot;complete&quot; through changes and possibly additional cars. Nonetheless it&#39;s a worthy set, but with its ins and pros.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I made this review years ago, when I got this train, which was the first in my collection. I must say, that I tried it in different &#39;modes&#39;, where it showed all of its sides. The large bricks, used to make the roof and the &quot;nose&quot; parts are by far <em>the worst details</em> about this particular set.</p>

<p>The passenger cars are spacious, but the roof would again prevent you from making changes to the inside: passengers can&#39;t stand in this train, thus there is a limit to a number of figures, placed inside.</p>

<p>The nose has another disadvantage &ndash; if you make a complex railway path, which goes up and down (like amountain), this train will most likely stop, as the nose would prevent it to go through such rails. The nose is also quite long and if it moves through your city, it will crush the nearby buildings, if there are any near the curved railway path.</p>

<p>The nose also sets a fixed height for this train, so if you make all the cars slightly higher, there will be a discrepance between different parts of the train.</p>

<p>Just like with many other railways sets of this era &ndash; this one doesn&#39;t have doors. The most disappointing thing about the trains these days...<br />

"Lolbrick","2009-10-30T13:51:18.623Z","Really cool looking but lacks creativity","As stated, I love the look of this, since I love the german ACE trains but lately I think Lego has been so lazy with the details on things like the almighty Metroliner had a walkthrought with the seats on the sides which is much more realistic with tables right in freakin' middle of the train... also, here's a great example of Lego using specially designed parts which doesn't even fit good... I mean, new parts are exciting of course but they should try to use what they have already and it should have at least three more Minifigures.

The good things though is the new Train system which really works cool, requires many batteries but that's forgiveable and Design looks nice of course.

"brixton","2009-09-06T17:35:28.967Z","Lightning Quick","I bought this train for a number of reasons.  I love trains, I always wanted a lego train and it looked awesome like the TGV it seems modeled after.  This set has a number of issues even though I really like it.  The train itself looks great and so does the platform that comes with it.  The catanery and working lights are nice little details.  The garbage can, vending machine with drinks, system map, digital time piece and light are also great pieces.  I was originally surprised at how wide the tracks are as it seems a bit disproportional to how normal train tracks look.  

There are numerous problems with this set.  The horn isn't very loud (minor problem) even though the remote works great and the train responds well.  An additional problem is the number of batteries it takes to run the thing.  6 for the train and 3 for the remote.  9 in total!  To adult insult to injury you only get 4 hours of run time!  Batteries aren't cheap so powering this thing is gonna cost you.  The on/off switch on the train is a nice feature that helps not wasting battery power.

The front pieces of the train are highly problematic.  They don't fit too well, are flimsy, don't line up with the rest of the bricks that make the train and fall off easily.  They are just one large manufactured piece that doesn't really fit with the rest of the well constructed train.  The interior is nothing special.  It comes with seats and table with a few glasses.  The main problem here is that a 500 piece set only comes with 3 minifigures.  A conductor and two passengers.  That makes for an empty train and platform. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Lmcfalcon12","2010-01-02T08:24:08.763Z","Poor Design by Lego Overall","I sit looking at this train on my table shaking my head in disappointment with how it was designed. The two cockpits on both the car with the motor and the rear car DO NOT fit snug against the rest of the train. There's a gap of a few centimeters and when you go to try and snug it back together, perhaps thinking you didn't put it together right, they pop off and you have to click them back on. Its almost as if those pieces on the front and rear are warped. 

The motor is heavy and the train itself does not move very fast due to the massive engine pack and 6 batteries that have to be placed inside the train. But overall I think my main disappointment with the train comes from its pieces not fitting together right. On Lego's online shop many reviews on the site commented on this and call the train ""cheaply"" made. It is just that. The main reason I buy models is for the way they look when they're finished and I can't stand to look at my train with pieces that don't fit tight together with gaps.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"charlotteslego","2010-11-20T17:11:47.68Z","Poorly built, but practical.","Many reviews complain about the way the front and rear carriages are made, where the cabin piece connects poorly with the rest of the carriage; I can't deny that it's a poor design, but it's not such a big deal. My biggest problem is with the overhang: when the train turns corners, the carriage swings over the sides of the track and hits whatever's next to it. This means that you can't have buildings tight up to the track, and have to leave at least 4 studs gap between curved tracks and any buildings, which leaves lots of wasted space in your LEGO city. The ridges on the underneath of the roof pieces mean that some headwear stops it from sticking down properly. Not a big problem. I think that this is the most attractive train to date, despite the poor design.<p>The platform is VERY small, but has some good features like the lamp, fridge thing and timetable. It is small, but provides an extra stop for your train and anyway, it's wide enough for one carriage and that's good enough really.</p><p>Overall, a good option if you're looking for a train to go in your City. Without having any other trains to compare it with, It's not for me to say whether this is the best option, but it's certainly worthwhile.</p>",TRUE,3,2,4,5,3

The Super Chief has it all over the ""ICE"" train in livery, but the ICE looks great moving around the city. (It's ""moving"" even when standing still!)

<p>Powered engine:<br />
Throughout this review, you will hear me complain exponentially about the stupid nose pieces this set uses, and I will start here. These nose pieces, for me at least, came very warped, meaning they did not sit on the front of the train the right way. I have now had the possesion of 7 different copies of this set, and I realize now it was not just my set that had the warped nose piece. Also on the subject of why I don&#39;t like this engine, I think it is far too long, especially since the non powered engine is much shorter. Also, this engine includes that horrible powered train base that luckily LEGO stopped using, meaning half of the train was blocked out by it. I give LEGO a pass for the Cargo train that used this piece, since it was just such a good set, but in this particular set, it just really stunk.</p>

<p>Passenger car:<br />
This car had the same overly simple build as the engine, since the roof is only 3 large pieces. The car, however, was in my opinon the best piece of this set, since using the parts of the generally crappy engines, you could make another one of this car, and pull both of them behind another engine.</p>

<p>Dummy engine:<br />
Why did this engine have to be shorter than the powered version?? I asked this when I was 6, and I am asking it today still. It just does not look right.</p>
