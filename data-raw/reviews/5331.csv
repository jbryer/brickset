"TXClark","2007-12-27T23:11:46.997Z","My First Lego Train","So maybe I missed out on the golden Lego train years but I found this set under the christmas tree and immediately assembled it. It was fun to build and run around the tracks but I'm bored with it only after 48hrs. Would like to see more cars available as well as different style locomotives. I know this is a sour subject since the r/c line is rumored to already be replaced in 2009.

Anyways, I'd say it's a good started set, be nice to order some parts and build my own train cars and maybe another loco.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mr_Dunlop","2007-12-31T02:16:07.64Z","Good time to start collecting trains!","I got this one in the mail two days after Christmas and it was the best surprise and the best present by far! This is a really good set, and if you’ve never bought a LEGO Train set before, like I, now is the perfect time to start and this is the perfect set to start with. For one, LEGO is beginning to phase out the predecessor line of LEGO trains, 9V. Exactly why this is isn’t known to me, but I think it’s a good move for no particular reason. Anyway, here is my pros and cons list:

Pros:
-	5 minifigures: I suppose some may consider this a bit small, but whatever.
-	Detailed instructions: As usual from LEGO.
-	Fair sized track.
-	Cool Red Roadster.
-	Truck and Forklift.
-	Good amount of carriages for the one set.
-	Remote controlled with a few different speeds (and a useful stop button).
-	Horn button on remote.
-	Train has working headlights.

Cons:
-	9 batteries required: Not included as usual.
-	Three cream-coloured cargo trays with only room for two on the train.
-	Tracks not compatible with 9V trains.
-	Track not very customizable (That’s what sets 7895 and 7896 are for, but whatever)
-	Horn sound comes out of the remote, not the train.
-	Crane car tips over when trying to hold up the Roadster.

All in all, this gets a 9 from me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"speed27","2009-08-23T06:13:56.95Z","great set","i got this set as well as the passenger train and train station. i got the passenger train on sale and thought i could use the extra track! i also got a points set and crossover set. what i am trying to find is the loco shed for a reasonable price (the world city one). i think lego should bring out a level crossing to tie it in with the city buildings and road plates.
you can use some of the city sets (container stacker) to load the flatbed instead of the car. the cargo truck and forklift also work in and the cargo from the truck fits into the cargo carriage.

"Blade","2008-07-13T15:07:11.967Z","Best Set of 2006!","Well for all us here in Australia the last two weeks have been our major toy sales for the year. I lashed out and have spent over $1000 on LEGO. Yeah I know, crazy! This model was one of the larger ones I picked up for $160AUS at Myer, who are usually Overpriced but this was one of their exclusives, along with Town Plan and the Eiffel Tower, which I also got :)This set is quite large and detailed as you would expect so I'll run through it piece by piece.

Firstly: The Locomotive
It is beautiful! Old style with all new mod cons. It is powered by a bower pack of six AA batteries. It is a fair amount and dose make the model quite heavy, but it is well worth it once you see it going round. The motor dose take up a fair amount of the interior room, but there is still room for a seat and controls at each end. There are four doors, two at each end for the conductor to get in and out. The carriages are connected by magnets at either end of the locomotive. There are also two headlights at the front of the train and two tail lights at the back. The front ones work when in use and the tails can be wired up too with an extra cable and globe. 
The roof removes quite easily too see inside and the train has seven speeds in both forward and backwards directions. If you speed the locomotive right up by itself it will derail on the tightest bend but with a full train or on a smoother bend she will stay on the tracks. The conductor is dressed in classic blue overalls and blue conductor’s hat, with a red scarf, grey gloves and quite a detailed smiley face.

Secondly: The Dumper or Cargo Wagon
Just what you would expect. Lovely bright red colour, can be filled right up with pieces and by lifting either side of the wagon will release its contents onto whatever is below. I have found my doors quite firm but if they do become flimsy, simply replace the black hinge pins for newer ones. The wagon also has a shovel at one end and a broom at the other for clean up. Comes with ten 1x1 cylinders as filler but could use a little more. Both ends also have a magnet so it can be attached from either direction and added onto.

Third: The Crane-Car
Very well designed section of the train. It has a small cab in the same lovely green as the train, with quick release roof and twin doors for the operator. He is dressed in all orange, with a red helmet and grey gloves. His face is quite detailed and he looks like he is concentrating hard on his work. 
It also has a mid size crane at the back, thus why it is called a crane car. The crane is yellow with black and grey. It has 360 degrees turning and can be raised and lowered. The hook is on a rope with a winder at the back for even more fun. When the crane is lowered, the arm sits comfortably between the lights on the roof of the cab. When the crane is raised right back you can easily access the cock pit for the crane operator, which lifts up like the old street sweeper. He is also dressed in a nice bright orange, with blue sleeves, red helmet and a detailed face.
In between the two is a space for a frame which can be lifted by the crane and fits over a car for lifting it onto the train. Also underneath the carriage are two legs, which swing out and drop down to be used when the crane is used, to stop it becoming top heavy and tipping over.

Fourth: Flatbed and Roadster
Again the flat bed is like its name, just a flat carriage wit rails at either end to stop things rolling off, four grates and two rails to help keep a vehicle in place. The red roadster is quite good, slightly longer than a normal LEGO car and different shape and could have used a bit more detail, but a very nice addition to this set. Wheel base is perfect for the clips on the car carrying frame for the crane.

Fifth: The Caboose
Just like in the old movies. Double opening doors on both sides, with lots of room inside. It is red with grey doors and roof. I did find it a bit flimsy when putting it together, but once the roof was on and clipped in, I have found it quite strong. Two of these would have been better but they are simple enough to make.

Sixth: The Forklift
The forklift is a lovely extra for this set so you can’t really complain. It has its own mini fig and working tinges. It comes with three pallets, one of engines, one of barrels and one of tanks, all with a crane pick-up point. Still I find the shape quite strange; it just looks out of shape. The tinges are spring loaded so they always stay up. I have also found the mast doesn't sit quite straight and can make picking up the pallets off a flat surface quite difficult. The wheel sizes and axle lengths are good as they are like realistic, but the scale just isn't right. Maybe my expectations are too high after the Locomotive.

Seventh: The Flatbed Truck
Just to break up the red and green LEGO have made this truck blue. It has a fully working tilt tray with releasable tailgate. The truck also has rear view mirrors, head lights and roof spotties. The tray also has gaps for the forklift tinges to get things off and on with ease. The mini-fig is dressed in orange overalls, with a blue under shirt, grey gloves and a red helmet. His face has detail and is smiley.

Eighth and Final: The Track and Remote Controller.
The track consists of 20 curved pieces, 8 straight pieces and 2 Y shaped pieces, with track changer on each. When assembled it is quite large and spans 147cm/ 57.9&quot; In and 84cm/33&quot; In wide. You will need more than this to move around and play with it fully. It is quite good to start with but buying more tracks is essential to maximise this model.
The controller has four simple buttons one for forward, backward, stop and horn. It also has three channels so you can control more than one train at a time or up to three at the same time. The controller takes three AA batteries totalling nine batteries all up. It would have been nice to see a rechargeable power pack for both but batteries are easier if something goes wrong. The controller is inferred, so no wires, which is a plus but something I would expect from this day and age.

Conclusion:
Overall this is the biggest review I have done to date. From the above you can see why. So much detail has gone into this model and while building it I picked up on so many things that I feel needed to be said. This has to be one of the best models I have in a collection over 400 strong. It has a few minor faults which I have listed most of in each individual section bar one, my biggest pet hate with LEGO. You know it, STICKERS! There are heaps of the bloody things and they are tiny and annoying. I haven't put any of them on and probably won’t. I just paid $160 on special for this model; they could at least have the courtesy to print the bloody pieces. Other than that I look forward to getting more tracks and having more fun with this model. This model is a hard one to rate. I feel everyone will say somewhere between an eight and ten out of ten. Currently I feel this one is a 9/10 or Almost Perfect, leaning towards a ten. Seriously save your money and get this set, you won't be disappointed. Every LEGO fan should have an electric train and if the rumour that they are fazing them all out in 2009 turns out to be true, this could be your last chance and best investment in your collection ever.

"lotographia","2009-04-22T01:12:39.81Z","Above and beyond the requirements for a decent train set.","This is one of those sets where the pictures don't do it justice. You have to see it in the flesh (brick?) to understand how cool it is. One thing though - make sure you have a big enough building area for the track! It's bigger than it looks. Fortunately my desk had half an inch to spare both horizontally and vertically.

There are a lot of stickers in this set, but that has never bothered me - my philosophy is that people who don't like stickers don't need to apply them if they don't want to. However, I do have one pet hate - stickers that go across more than one brick so you can never fully disassemble the model. This set has two such stickers. Normally I would dock a point for this, but in this case I'm going to overlook it. The bricks with these stickers on them are standard red 1x3 blocks, and everyone should have at least a hundred of these in their collection anyway.

One thing I like about this set is that the pallets are the same as the ones used Truck & Forklift 7733. When the Lego company has this kind of continuity between products released more than a year apart, it feels like they care about their loyal customers.

I can't think of anything this set is lacking. It would be nice to be able to buy some additional carriages, and I won't buy Emerald Night until additional carriages become available, but the four carriages and one engine included in this set at least give it a sense of completion. It's not just an engine with one carriage like other sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AlterBrick__Vienna__Austria","2009-07-22T13:56:19.607Z","Perfect start - buy it before it's gone!","This is my first LEGO train set (besides the Emerald, which comes without motor & tracks).

The diversity of the waggons is huge. Each part of the set is just perfect to build & play.

There ought to be some buildings that go with the box car or to load the open car in extra sets. E.g. a factory or a conveyor of a stone pit etc.

Maybe a special collectors' edition would be even more interesting: The locomotive in dark green, the red parts in dark red, the blue ones in dark blue, yellow turns tan - this would give an aged/dirty look vs an all brand-new look caused by the bright colors. Model railway fans do that too: They paint ""dirt"" on their brandnew models!

Stickers are included, but my cargo train runs well without any - I just do not put them on - and I do not miss a thing. To me the stickers take away the ""happy strenght"" of the bright LEGO-colors.

What's left to mention? The locomotive is a German one: http://www.modelleisenbahn-pocking.de/content/images/baf2c3c483eb412c32cb92197c3000e2.jpg called E94 or later on 194 - nicknamed ""Krokodil"" which is ""Crocodile"" (surprise! ""German Crocodile"" to be exact to differntiate from the Swiss and Austrian one).

"Legocityfanatic","2011-02-24T18:48:13.013Z","Perfect!","<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Just so you know, this is going to be one long review, probably one of the longest I have ever made. Since it is so long I will divide it into parts of the set. I remember this set, but not as much as I used to. Before starting, this set is perfect except for one very minor flaw.<div><br></div><div><b>Cargo Truck- </b>This blue truck can carry up to two cargo trays at a time. It has the Lego National Cargo Sign and color and a nice tipping function to unload the cargo it is carrying for the forklift to load the crane.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Forklift- </b>This forklift is differently shaped than most other forklifts I have ever seen in real life or build with Lego before. I like the spring function to bring the cargo up and get it ready for loading and unloading. The little tank at the end confuses me for its purpose, Is it a weight ballast or an engine, an oxygen tank of some sort? Good add on!</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Cargo- </b>I included those grey cylindrical pieces and the car as pieces of cargo. In all this set consists of five pieces of cargo: two engine blocks, four red pieces with black tops, what I think is supposed to be four barrels of some sort of liquid, ten grey cylinders (which I think is supposed to represent metal or grain), and a sports car. The cargo is something you can find on a real train.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Track Layout- </b>The track is laid out in an oval shape, but not quite. It has a point where you switch for two straight track pieces and then switch back to the oval. There is a crossing for the forklift and the to come through that doesn't derail the train. I'm not sure, but I think there are two extra curved tracks left at the end.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures- </b>The minifigures in this set are among my favorite, as I do love Lego Trains. They include a Train Conductor, Forklift Operator, Truck Driver, Crane Operator, and the Crane Car Operator. Most of these minifigures are all unique in their own ways.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Remote- </b>Well, the most I can say is that it is easy to control the train with this remote. You can control the up to three trains at a time and they go pretty fast at top speed. I also noticed, and like the studs on the remote so you can decorate it with Lego pieces and figures.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Hopper Car-</b>&nbsp;This is a highly detailed set and looks a lot like a real one. There is not much more to say other than it is for holding the grey cylindrical pieces and has space to hold a lot more!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Flatbed Car- &nbsp;</b>Again, not much to say about this. The piece of cargo this holds is the red sports car, which is very cool. The car is a snuggly fit between the two yellow pieces and stays in place most of the ride. I like the realistic barrier pieces at the each side.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Box Car- </b>As I stated before, I do not remember this set that well. I know it's supposed to hold to pieces of cargo on the&nbsp;beige pieces but not if it holds all three or only two. The door pieces on this car are like nothing I have ever seen before in Lego pieces. This is, one of my favorite parts of this set.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Breakdown Crane Car-</b>&nbsp;Is again, one of my favorite parts of this set. But here lies the problem, I'll get into it soon. It includes a cab (probably so it can drive itself if not connected to anything), and a crane to lift the red sports car onto the flatbed car. It is a nice, green color and rides smoothly on the rails. The crane has the little problem. When my friends broke my Lego's apart (as stated in another review of mine((contact me if you want to know why))), and I tried to fix it, the top of the crane would not snap together the right way.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Locomotive-</b>&nbsp;This is... my favorite part of this set. As stated by other reviewers, it is based off a real locomotive engine in Germany that was only used once:<img src=""http://www.modelleisenbahn-pocking.de/content/images/baf2c3c483eb412c32cb92197c3000e2.jpg""></div><div><img src=""http://images.shoppit.co.uk/sizeimage.aspx?client=18436&amp;image=Cargo_Engine.jpg&amp;height=220&amp;width=200&amp;colour=FFFFFF&amp;offer=0""></div><div>Anyways, the locomotive is simply beautiful! it is detailed, and has enough power to carry everything. Not much more to say, sadly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The overall train </b>is one of the- no, the best train Lego has ever made, it could have used more cars behind it, but then again, it wouldn't have had enough power to carry it.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Instructions-</b>&nbsp;The instructions are fairly easy to read and not very confusing at most points.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Box- </b>Is a large mass of cardboard that is very appealing to the eye. It is colorful and makes you want to buy the train for all it's features.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Building- </b>The build is challenging for younger folk and easier for adults. I build Lego's a lot more slow for some reason when I can build them very fast.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Parts-</b>&nbsp;Are rare when it comes to color, and in some cases, shape. They are easy to work with though.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Playability- </b>The playability in this set is endless, by buying more cargo pieces and track, you can spend hours loading and unloading cargo, and driving it around your city! Makes an awesome display piece too!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Price- </b>Just a tiny bit more than I expected, if you find one now for just a little bit more than original price, still go out and buy it! It is a very valuable set!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion-</b>&nbsp;This is my favorite Lego set, if you are building a Lego City, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED. The new train is OK, but this is the best you can get. Thanks for reading this very long review. I hope you enjoyed!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"av8r1973","2011-02-13T07:53:28.177Z","Beautiful!  Simply beautiful!","This isn't just a train. &nbsp;It's a diorama on it's own. &nbsp;And a great one, at that. Check this list of set components out.<div><br></div><div>1. Locomotive - accurately detailed electric locomotive (European style, but still very cool). &nbsp;This guy can be driven from either end and the engineer can go through any of four doors. &nbsp;The light brick for the front lights was a welcome surprise, as well. &nbsp;The integrated plow on both ends adds some utilitarian realism to it.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Hopper car - nice and simple design with both sides hinged. &nbsp;The small amount of payload provided doesn't do much except show you what you should put in there. &nbsp;I need about 100 more pieces to make it more realistic. &nbsp;This guy is typical of what you would see on any freight train. &nbsp;Nice.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Crane car - outstanding!! &nbsp;There's a driver's cabin up front (it's not a powered car, but it doesn't matter) that looks great and realistic. &nbsp;In the back is a beautifully engineered crane that swivels and lifts. &nbsp;A manual knob in the back allows you to raise or lower the hook. &nbsp;The cabin also opens smoothly to get the operator out. &nbsp;A set of outriggers stores cleverly underneath to use when supporting ""heavy"" loads. &nbsp;The car also stores a great little spreader bar apparatus that cleanly lifts the car on the next car.</div><div><br></div><div>4. Flatbed car - beautiful simple little flatbed car that is slightly customized for carriage of the car. This is just a short flatbed, but it can carry either the car, or the included freight. &nbsp;Some small barriers at the end keep the freight in place. &nbsp;The brackets for the car are great, too.</div><div><br></div><div>5. Freight car - This is a smoothly-engineered car. &nbsp;I love it and plan to build several more just like it. &nbsp;It has sliding ""barn doors"" on both sides that operate seamlessly. &nbsp;As another reviewer mentioned, it was a bit flimsy until the roof was in place, but then it's very sturdy.</div><div><br></div><div>This kit didn't just give you the train, there were some great extras, too! &nbsp;These items weren't necessary for the kit, but really add a lot of value to it.</div><div><br></div><div>6. Truck - a nice little flat/tilt-bed blue truck (very common in Asia) that is able to haul the included freight, or will hold just about everything else you can think of. &nbsp;the short sides have slots that allow simple loading and unloading with the forklift.</div><div><br></div><div>7. Forklift - nice little freight yard propane-powered forklift. &nbsp;The fuel tank in the back is an excellent addition for some realism. &nbsp;The forks are the same ones I played with as a kid 30 years ago, so nothing new here. &nbsp;They stay raised, unless your thumb holds them down. &nbsp;It works smoothly.</div><div><br></div><div>8. Car - A mediocre little red sports car. &nbsp;Not a lot of time was spent on details, but it's an ok car for my cityscape or for the freight train. &nbsp;The spreader bar on the crane car lifts this little guy from the wheels and places it in place on the flatbed. &nbsp;Nice.</div><div><br></div><div>9. &nbsp;Freight - three pallets of goods. &nbsp;One is a set of Octan-themed fuel barrels similar to other sets. &nbsp;One is a set of what appear to be gas cylinders. &nbsp;The third looks like a set of high-power 4-cylinder engines. &nbsp;Either the crane car or the forklift can easily pick these pallets up.</div><div><br></div><div>10. Track - Gobs of track. &nbsp;Straights and curves galore. &nbsp;Also, a set of smooth-operating switches. &nbsp;It allows for the train to get off of the main track for loading and unloading while other trains can continue by. &nbsp;The instruction booklet (1 of 8) has a nice example of three layouts. &nbsp;One can be created with the included track, while the other two require some additional track sets and they tell you which ones. &nbsp;I built the second recommendation because I had enough extra curves and straights from another set. &nbsp;Very cool, indeed.</div><div><br></div><div>11. Remote control - Since the train is remote controlled, it had to have a controller. &nbsp;While not quite as sleek as the newer sets, this is cool. &nbsp;Forward and backwards each have 7 speeds from a single rocker switch. &nbsp;Up for forward, down for backwards. &nbsp;The other side has a horn button (my daughters LOVE that one) and an ""emergency"" stop. &nbsp;That's good for those high-speed corners that exceed the physics involved with intertia.</div><div><br></div><div>12. Track crossing - only 8 studs wide, but it allows cars and trucks to get over the tracks easily. &nbsp;No crossing bars or lights, but even the passenger train didn't come with a means to cross the tracks.</div><div><br></div><div>13. Minifigs - A full complement of these little guys. &nbsp;All are unique and well-suited to the role. &nbsp;From the concentrated look on the crane operators face to the look of glee on the engineers face (with his bandana), they all fit the role wonderfully.</div><div><br></div><div>14. Box - I haven't mentioned a box in any other reviews, but this one is brilliantly done. &nbsp;It's a huge box with an opening lid with lots more excellent photography showing what you could do if you had nothing but money and time. &nbsp;The rest of the box artwork is nicely done, too. &nbsp;Excellent marketing by the LEGO Group on this one.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are at all interested in LEGO trains, this is one you can't miss. &nbsp;I have the passenger train and the new cargo train, but this one really means ""deluxe""!! &nbsp;I am currently looking for a second train to make this one longer. &nbsp;This is what LEGO is all about - absolutely brilliant!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Kyon_Pwns_You","2013-12-29T13:22:32.023Z","A great set for a bargain price","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, I bought this set off BrickLink for $360 dollars and It is a great set for a bargain price now let&#39;s get to the review</p>

<p>The Locomotive:</p>

<p>A good looking locomotive and I know a little bit on American Railroading and European Railroading, This train is based off the German version of the Crocodile also known as the &quot;Krokodil&quot; &nbsp;locomotive which served the German railroads from 1919 to 1921 and then the trains were rebuilt in 1942 to 1947. The locomotive itself is very durable and fast when at full speed. The Horn and LED lights are great accessories to the locomotive and I noticed that the LED lights in the back do&nbsp;not&nbsp;light up unless you hook a wired brick into it. And the LED lights get brighter as the locomotive picks up speed</p>

<p>The Onboard Crane:</p>

<p>The cab of the front of the train car looks like the locomotive but then it does not have a somewhat resemblance to the locomotive of the set. The crane itself has a durable winch and the car has stabilizers to keep the&nbsp;crane from ending up on its side</p>

<p>The Flatbed:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>A typical European flatbed car despite only being able to hold one car while 7939&#39;s flat bed car can hold two small cars this car looks better and can carry a full sized LEGO car</p>

<p>The Box:</p>

<p>Not much to say but this car looks like the typical American boxcar on one of their trains but some versions of this train set have air conditioners but the version I have does not have an air conditioner. This car is able to hold two pallets of cargo which are either two four cylinder engines or four fuel tanks of different colors&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gondola:</p>

<p>A typical coal hopper, not much to say</p>

<p>The Truck:</p>

<p>A nice little addition to the set it can hold two pieces of cargo and can dump the cargo it is carrying&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Car:</p>

<p>A cool little sports car that fits great on the flatbed car it looks like it could fit in your city</p>

<p>The Forklift:</p>

<p>Just a forklift, two things I noticed about the forklift. I has a spring loaded lift. Another thing I noted about the forklift is the propane tank in the back. It appears to be a propane-powered forklift&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set would be a great addition to anyone&#39;s LEGO City</p>
