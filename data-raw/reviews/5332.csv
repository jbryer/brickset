"greg_duncan","2006-07-21T09:36:22Z","outstanding toa!","I must say this set is great. The inika are in my opinion the greatest bionicle heroes ever made, and Jaller is one of the best of the best. His mask is great, his parts and colors are great, and the features are excellent. While his primary color is still dark red, this toa of fire features a newer transparent orange for all the sockets, creating an original look that works well. The zamor launcher is nice, having 4 to shoot thanks to a new ammo clip which is nice. The greatest part of this set is the light-up sword though. Instead of just lighting up like light sabers (which the share colors with) or piraka eyes, the sword blinks rapidly for a few seconds before shutting off. Also, the battery IS replacable, which leaves me highly recommending this awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legozander","2007-01-25T05:03:00Z","Great!","I got Toa Jaller a few days ago to finish of me and my brothers Inika collection and found out that my least favoutite Inika was way better than I exspected! Jaller features cool sleek gold armour an extremly cool flame sword that lights up green. As well as a very cool mask! (It looks weird though.) The zamor launcher is very cool and makes the Pirakas look tiny! :) Unfortunatly the zamors fall out really easily. This can easliy be fixed though. The only bits I dont really like on Jaller are his feet. (They look very weird.) So Toa Jaller is an exellent Toa to get, So if you are planning on getting toa Jaller you are making a good choice! Jaller gets a good 4/5 :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-08T11:33:02.11Z","Awesome inika","A awesome set, includes glow orange pieces, but only two golden colors, the armor and the light up sword, a great feature. It light is green, the head don't glows and have the same colors of the other inika. The crimsom pieces are cool, but they are the same of various inika. The mask is maded with other material, it is strange, don't like very a mask for toa.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-13T10:24:07.06Z","&quot;I can do things others may think impossible.&quot;","This, my friends, is a great Toa!  It used to be my brother's, but after several attempts to glue back on a part of the broken torso, Joe tore it up.  I just built it back yesterday, replacing the broken red torso for a grey torso.  Otherwise, he is totally complete, and I think he is a good addition to my collection of Toa Inika (I have four now).  Okay, like all the Toa Inika, Jaller has a multi-shot Zamor launcher and a light-up strobe sword.  I was using the multi-shot part of the launcher for a MOC, but I took it for Jaller, and built my own multi-shot piece for the MOC.  You can see how to build your own at brickshelf.com, and search the gallery for Piraka Fusion.  Don't ask about the name, just search it.
Anyway, other than the energized flame sword and Zamor launcher, Jaller has a Mask of Fate, which, unfortunately, can only fit on other Toa Inika heads.  Otherwise he is a complete clone of other Toa Inika, which is a Con.  Toa started out different, but then became clones, and stayed clones until the Toa Mahri cam out in '07 (one of the best teams EVER).  But, as Jaller was free (all I had to do was build him back), it's worth keeping him.  It doesn't cost me anything to pose him on my shelf, even if I don't play with him.  Anyway, here's the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

-Multi-shot Zamor launcher

-Strobe-light energized flame sword

-Translucent leg and hand pieces

-Free (for me anyway)

-Leader of the Toa Inika

Cons:

-Clone of other Toa Inika

-Mask of Fate can only fit on Toa Inika heads

Overall:

I like Toa Jaller myself, and am glad my brother broke him up so I could build him back for myself. :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-03-02T14:51:46.763Z","Toa Jaller, leader of the Toa Inika!","           Well, my brother and I both have this set. Both broke, but my brother rebuilt him excapt for the light sword and the launcher. That is okay though, because I don't like the Zamor Spere Launchers. Hovever, I do like the light sword.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-13T10:16:30.457Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Toa Inika) - Toa Jaller Review","<p>This is a great figure to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 32 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some really cool parts in it. I really like the design which LEGO has chosen for the mask. They're rubbery and much different than the ones we've used to see on a BIONICLE figure. I also like his sword which we get with this figure. All pieces we get are very nice for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8727-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the legs, the feet, the hands and the head of the figure can be adjusted. On the one side of Jaller's hand you'll see a catapult launcher which shoots green balls. The other hand has a nice looking sword. On the sword you'll find a button which you can use to switch the light on. I'm really sad that I haven't got the other 5 toa inika figures but I hope to get them all in the future.<br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The transparent pieces are just awesome.<br></li><li>-The gold pieces make Jaller the king of the Toa.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Everything is wrong when it comes to the mask.<br></li><li>-The strobe effect on the sword is great, but looks weird as green.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is truly excellent, the best of the Inika in my opinion. He looks like the average red Bionicle, but he's so much more. I highly recommend this set to all red Bionicle lovers.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
