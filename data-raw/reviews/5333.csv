And all of Voya Nui for that matter.","Out of all the toa Inika, Hahli and Nuparu are the only ones that I really like, Hahli being the best. Her color scheme is great! The weapons are really cool.

"Gus_263","2008-02-25T12:19:31.373Z","Toa Inika of water","Hahli, like all the Inika have two awesome weapons. This set includes a sphere launcher with the capacity to support four spheres and Hahli also includes an &quot;laser harpoon&quot; that lights up, like all the Inika weapons, doing a good effect. The Hahli colors are white, blue and gray. I do not like the color combination and also the mask design. The Hahli&#180;s feet, arms and legs are basically like all the other Inika, but with an different color scheme. Overall, i rate 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T16:05:43.123Z","Toa Hahli, the Review","Hahli is my second favorite Toa Inika, my first being Matoro.  I like how the strobe light color matches the Zamors, but her head is just a weird, green-and-white bit of plastic that only Toa Inika masks can go on.  Other than that, she's fine.  Here's the stats.

Pros:

-Harpoon light matches Zamors

-Zamor launcher shoots reasonably far

-Posable

Cons:

-Blob of a head

-Top Zamor on the launcher falls out

Otherwise, Hahli is an okay set.  Toa Mahri Hahli, though... :D  (see my review on Toa Mahri Hahli).  Anyway, get this set if you like blue Bionicles and you collect Bionicles.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-30T15:56:59.28Z","Very Electrical","Hahli's color scheme is very interesting. Her feet, lower legs, and shoulder armor are a rather unusual blend of blue and white, which I think is very cool! The Kanohi Elda, mask of detection, looks like a very tired face, because of those huge ""bags"" under the eyeholes that go to the back of it. I have noticed that every Toa Inika mask has a ""mouth"" except for Matoro. On to the Toa Tools. One day, a Star Wars-crazed little kid came to my house and wanted a lightsaber, so when I was not looking, he took a scissor to the laser harpoon. Now, I only have a broken half of it and the zamor launcher. It shoots well, but the top zamor falls out easily. The chest armor and zamor launcher kind of sticks out, but I am okay with it.

pros: (Excluding laser harpoon)
Blended blue and white.
Kanohi Elda.
Zamor launcher
Nice choice of feet.

cons:
none

This is a great Toa of Water. I do not have another Toa Inika, but I think you should get her with another one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
