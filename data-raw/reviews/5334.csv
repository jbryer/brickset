Why did you say it did janaio?? Nevermind anyway Nuparu rocks sooo much. His claws are awesome his armour is really cool his drill is to cool for words , his zamor spherse and launcher are cool as well and i like the way its on his shoulder. :) His mask of flights cool as well. :) By the way its rubbery. The zamor spheres tend to fall out easily. :( so i built a stopper. :) You can see the modifications i have done on Nuparu if you go to Brickeens.blogspot.com. (Thats me and my bros blog.)  So long!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-14T20:15:27.543Z","One of the Better Inika","Overall, the Inika have not impressed me, and this includes Nuparu. But with his cons, there are his pros. 

The canisters are not to my liking (not why I took points off on initial rating), they are too big in my opinion, and could have easily been shrunken down a tad. They include a display that shows off four orange (mine had two orange, one red, and one orange/red) Zamors, and its tool. Quite unofrunatly, there is a Try-Me feature for the light up weapon. Make sure you grab one from the back like I did. 

When I dumped the set out, I was initially impressed. Lots of new pieces including feet and body pieces. The only piece problem is the head, which I don't see having any other uses except to display Inika masks. An upside though are his silver claws. Not only are they different, but they are also very cool, and, at least for me, are preferable to his laser drill. The laser drill his heavy and awkward, and doesn't exactly impress me overall. It looks like Lego wanted the light up feature more than a cool weapon. 

When the set is complete, it stands taller than most sets. But it doesn't seem to have that much pose-ability. Maybe I'm just weird, but the only pose that really looks good is the one displayed on the cover art, with this drill being held in two hands. It doesn't look bad, but I wanted more out of this set. The other problem is skinniness. Nuparu is unnaturally skinny for a Toa, and I'm not too fond for his long neck. 

The Zamor also isn't too my liking. It doesn't shoot that far, and the top Zamor will always fall out. The good thing about this set is that the launcher was placed on the shoulder, which looks pretty cool.

In the end, Nuparu lost points on his tool being strange looking, and his overall appearance. He gained a point for being the most original Inika, and in the end, he has earned a fair 4 out of 5. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"smiley905","2007-12-30T13:39:52.483Z","awsome and full of good ideas","the mask looks awsome, although it looks a bit more like a bad guy than good, its rubbery, but the bad thing about it is you cant switch it around to other sets. the wepon is ok, im not a fan of the glowing wepons, but still alright. the ball shooter works great and their the best guns so far (i havnt tried the phantaka guns so i might be rong) and it can carry more balls than the piraka's could. he has lots of peices that were new at the time, and lego went a step further giving him cool claws. i like his feet there cool and hes also a lot taller than most bionicles. the is a good set and deserves 5\5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"coco1","2007-12-30T18:57:01.95Z","inika rocks!!","Nuparu is a million percent cool because I love Nuparu's awesome claws. His armour feel like real armour. Best of all, I love those spikes on his head.  I love the glow on the Inika's swords as well. I really love the way that his bullet launcher is connected to his back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-10T13:14:10.92Z","One of the best inika","Nuparu is one great inika. But he don't looks like a toa of earth. He have pieces with light colors, and his mask don't like a strong toa. One of the most things that he like a toa of earth is his weapon, a drill that lights up in the red color. The face is strange, the same of all inika. He also have claws and a sphere launcher good positioned on his back that can launchs four spheres.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tkettle9719","2012-01-07T21:15:34.27Z","The Digging Toa!","<p>I got this set full price at Walmart, and think that this is one of the best Inika Toas in the series.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The sphere launcher is awesome and upgraded for the Toa.<br></li><li>-The claws are awesome here too.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The Zamor spheres aren't red, which I was looking really forward to.<br></li><li>-I also think that the mask system here is very odd.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a truly excellent set, with many fine and grand details within it. I highly recommend this set to all Bionicle fans.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Nmfrey23","2022-01-11T02:55:10.483Z","(Slightly) breaking the mold ","<p>Many Bionicle fans (myself included)&nbsp;greatly enjoyed the Inika sets from 2006. However, there was one common level of complaint with these sets. They were, more or less, clones of one and other. 4/6 of them are identical in terms of both build and piece count. Nuparu as well as Hewkii broke from this pattern slightly, and contained more than 46 parts. Between these two, Nuparu is the only one with a slightly altered build (Hewkii&#39;s extra parts come from his chain), and has some design features that I really like.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>High piece count for a Toa Inika.</p>

<p>LOTS of new parts: Mask, head block, torso armour, leg armour, lower leg pieces, shoulder armour, feet, extended ammo launcher, claws, and drill are all new.</p>

<p>Shoulder mounted launcher can be aimed (has a ball joint) and holds 4 shots.</p>

<p>Drill lights up.</p>

<p>Claws: Keeps up with the motif&nbsp;of Earth Toa having claws as weapons. The claws also let Nuparu Hold his drill with one hand or both.</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rubber mask can warp if not placed on head block.</p>

<p>Wrists can&#39;t move outwards or claws will pop off.</p>

<p>Ammo can fall out of launcher easily.</p>

<p>Box art shows ammo in wrong colour (yellow instead of red).</p>

<p>Drill requires 3 cell batteries.</p>

<p>While not my favourite of the Inika, Nuparu is the most unique in terms of his build. If you&#39;re looking for a decent standalone set, a way to see what the Inika sets were like, or if you are looking for an introduction to Bionicle as a whole, Nuparu is a good set to check out. 4/5.</p>
