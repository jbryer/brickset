The Toa Inika brought many new changes to the standard Toa design, and were unlike any other canister sets before them, at the time at their release. Featuring light-up weapons, zamor launchers with rapid-fire ammo carriers, truly unique masks and armor, and an incredible height, the Inika are a sight to behold, both for better and for worse.

Toa Hewkii is one of the most unique Stone Toa ever, for obvious reasons. Besides being the first Stone Toa to carry a standard hand combat weapon (an axe), his color scheme is unlike any Stone canister kit before him. Doing away with the standard brown, Hewkii has orange-yellow joints (called Keetongu yellow in reference to the first Bionicle kit featuring the color) and gunmetal armor. Due to mediocre sales for the brown canister sets (compared to other colors), TLC has started to instead use keetongu yellow and colors like gray or black for stone kits. While this may be a major change, Hewkii looks striking and unique with it, and it sets him apart from the other stone Toa.

The Inika feature a boatload of new molds, with the only reused pieces (besides the standard Technic) being the arms, legs to body connector and Keetongu yellow joints. The shoulder and knee armor, legs, feet, head and front and back body pieces are all new. Also, there are two different feet and chest armor styles, each being in half of the Inika. The new armor pieces come in various colors, and they are quite good to use in MOC’s, as well as just looking plain cool. The back armor piece is more or less an unfinished Piraka body, and presents more uses than the former. The legs feature knee guards that, oddly, have large gaps in the middle. Still, they prevent unrealistic leg positions, so that’s cool. The feet are also cool, and I can see uses for them, although they are more difficult to use. Last and definitely least, the head is the worst of all the new pieces. Actually, it’s just a lime and white blob, with axle holes in the bottom. Originally, it was going to be glow in the dark, but now it is used to simulate the green eyes and white teeth in the Inika masks. Besides being practically useless in MOCs, this head is incompatible with all previous masks, and makes Inika mask incompatible with the old Toa heads. This in my opinion was a terrible move on TLC’s part, and I find it the most disappointing thing about the Inika.

Besides all the brand new Inika parts, Hewkii has 3 unique molds: his mask, axe, and a new chain link part. His mask, the Kanohi Sanok, is in my opinion one of the best stone Toa masks to date (ignoring the method of head connection). It truly looks like lumps of rock, while also being cool, and the gunmetal color is wonderful on it. As with most of the Inika weapons, Hewkii’s axe is not particularly interesting to me, and looks kind of weird. Still, the light-up feature is pretty cool, and looks awesome in the dark. Arguably, the most interesting mold is the new chain pieces. There’s a total of 11 in Hewkii, and they all connect solidly. Unlike the System chains, these pieces were made to fit in with Technic and Bionicle creations, thus they look very cool.

When built, Hewkii is very tall and poseable, as are all the Inika. His Zamor launcher is fairly cool looking, and works fairly well, but I know many dislike it. My answer: just take it off and replace it! It’s as simple as that.

Overall, Hewkii is the best of the Inika, along with Matoro, and should be your first Inika purchase if you get any. 5/5

He like very he others, but he include with good colors in the armor, and a   chain, that makes the weapon more cool than of other inika weapons. This set can be upgraded with some yellow, but no with very brown, my favorite color for toas. Another problem is the silver pieces. The sphere launcher addition don' like with the launcher, and the weapon with the armors. Overall, i rate it 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2009-03-17T18:35:41.343Z","A little different Toa Inika","Not saying that they weren't 'clones,' but Hewkii is a little different.  First of all the color, second of all his head is positioned a bit differently, to make it jut out a little further than the others (I know you're thinking get lost BIONICLE purist) and his kneepads are flipped so as to actually protect his knees.  Overall he looks a little better than the rest, and may be my favorite Toa Inika.

Pros:

-A little bit different

-Light-up sword

-Chain

-Multi-shot Zamor launcher

Cons:

-'Clone' of other Inika",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
