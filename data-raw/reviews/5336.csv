"A_Brickset_user","2006-08-02T07:24:34Z","This is totally awesome","Kongu is my faveourite inika. His cross bow is cool the way it lights up. The cross  bow lights up blue and you can get the zamor spheres in diffrient shades of blue. I think that the reloading zamor sphere launcher is really cool. The zamor sphere on the top of the launcher falls out very easly.

"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-19T15:13:07.547Z","A Good Example of a Bad Set","When I first saw the Inika, I was not pleased. But I thought to myself, why not give them a chance? So I did, and I got Kongu Inika. The striking blue of the Zamor spheres quickly got me excited, but it all went downhill from there.

Pieces and assembly: The assembly, like most Bionicle canister sets, is pretty strait forward, and that doesn't bother me. What does, are the pieces, especially the head. The head is horrible. It's a green plastic blob, and the mask is incompatible with virtually everything with the exception of that green plastic blob. The mixture of green and silver is slightly attractive, but the attractiveness ends there. The next part of interest is the tool: A crossbow. When I first heard this Toa was going to have a crossbow, so many ideas and opportunities for this set came to mind. I must saw, I was heart fully disappointed. Not only is the crossbow completely stable (doesn't launch), but it actually took me a while to tell it was a crossbow, and it still hardly looks like one. Mainly due to the fact that when positioned normally, the ends go vertically instead of horizontally. The tool is also excessively heavy, probably because of the strobe batteries. While I am not fond of the strobe effect, I don't hate it either.

The next part is the Zamor sphere. This may initially look cool, but it's really not. The Zamors don't shoot far at all (I much prefer the Kanoka Disks), and the top Zamor even falls out quite easily.

This set is not the greatest LEGO has ever done, but I don't dislike it with a purple passion either. Therefore, it deserves a three out of five.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-13T23:21:42.653Z","Almost as good as Nuparu","Being green is always an excuse for me to give a high rating. But personally, I think that this guy should get a higher rating than 5 (not as good a rating as Nuparu though, cause Nuparu rocks the earth. Teehee).

Pros:

Mask may look weird but is awesome
Crossbow
Zamor Launcher
Zamor Holder
Zamors are blue
Shoulder armour
Inika feet
Chest plate

Cons:

Limb armour isn't green

Other than that minor con, Kongu is awesome!

The sphere launcher is completely silver and the spheres blue. The mask is strange, don't symetrical, but good comparing with the mask of hahli or jaller inika. The crossbow is a cool weapon, that lights blue.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T13:53:34.937Z","Cool Toa","This is a cool/weird Toa.  His mask is weird.  And their head is weird.  But it ays that when they took off their mask there was a bright light!  I guess that is why they have no head!  This is a cool set over all!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-22T08:15:52.827Z","Weird Mask","Kongu was my last Toa Inika I collected.  Not my favorite, but he still deserves a five.  I can't figger out my favorite part about him; maybe it's the blue zamors and strobe sword.  Anyway, I like everything about him, except that his mask is a little weird.  Anyway, on to the Pros and Cons.

Pros (these should always come first):

Blue Zamors

Strobe sword

Silver and green color scheme

Better Zamor launcher than the Piraka's

Cons:

Weird Mask

If you like Bionicles, then get this set.  If you are a part-time collector, then get Toa Inika Matoro or Nuparu.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
