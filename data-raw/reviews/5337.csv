"legoguysw","2008-01-06T10:30:29.59Z","The Toa Of Ice in all his glory","2006 was my favourite bionicle year. This set is awesome. The new zamor sphere launchers are so cool: you can take them off the bionicle and the fit nicely in your hand with your fingers on the trigger ready for action! The balls launch out far, unlike the cordak blasters, they barely worked!
The bionicle itself is cool: The new masks look better than the others, and give the set a more realistic feel. The mask is rubbery, and doesent come off easily (although comes off quick when you pull it).
The light sword really lights up, and flashes. I dont think it will be that easy to change the batteries. I'm surprised light up functions werent in the later sets. The whole bionicle fits (when pieces are taken off and put in afterwards) into the box well, with the light sword and zamor spheres (blue in this set) fiting nicely onto a two piece bit on the top. 
I highly reccomend this set to bionicle lovers....",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

His colors are basically white, silver and blue, that is an cool color combination. His arms legs and feet are like some other toa inika, also much playable. His mask is awesome, but his head is not good designed (i think that the Lego group had created these heads to the inika masks, more expressive, be fixed). Like all the Inika, Matoro also have an sphere launcher with capacity to shoot four spheres, that works very well and a sword that lights up, doing a good effect. I rate matoro 5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T16:10:57.06Z","Favorite Toa Inika","Matoro is AWESOME, dude, if only for his sword and blue Zamors!!  I like his mask power, but his head... :(  Oh well, I won't go into that again.  Anyway, his transparent joints are cool, as well as his strobe light sword.  He is also fully posable.  Here's the Pros and Cons:

Pros:

-Strobe sword

-Blue Zamors

-Mask power

-Posable

Cons:

-Head

That's the review on Matoro.  I recommend getting him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KodakKid365","2010-11-17T09:51:23.223Z","Matoro=awesome","His gun is just like the rest of the toa's guns back then. It comes with four bullets and can hold all four at one time. Then his sword, also like all swords back then, it's cool and it lights up. Matoro is awesome and, yes, I would recommend him to anyone.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
