"Deinonychus","2007-02-04T00:26:51.833Z","Less then the sum of his parts","A guardian of the Mask of Light, Umbra is an interesting departure from conventional Bionicle Titan design. Interesting not necessarily meaning good. I personally had no interest or desire to own this set, but I found him very cheap ($3 US) so I decided he’d be a good parts set at worst.

Umbra is, indeed, a good parts set. He has a nice variety of pieces as well as an extra pair of the light-up Toa Inika swords. The colors in the set are nothing really special, but there is a decent spread of universally useful black and silver.

Once into the construction, you begin to discover some very clever and pleasing structures forming. The assemblies of the torso and roller-feet are particularly good. Neck articulation is designed pretty decent and even the arms and legs are designed well enough. By this point the architecture of the body is sound, then you get to the staff weapon. 

Umbra’s double-ended weapon also mounts a Rhotuka spinner in its center. The construction is a little over-complicated, bulky, and heavy. So much so that it throws the balance of the entire figure completely off. Umbra leans in whichever direction the weapon is hanging. 

In addition to the balance problems, the finished figure also has hip-joint trouble due to the substantial weight of the upper half. All this combines to create a figure that can’t stand up for beans. The finished figure also seems overburdened with detailing pieces thanks to the claws on the shoulders and shins. Umbra’s mask is a standard black Kanohi Ruru that originally belonged to Toa Metru Whenua. It seems out of place and makes the figure look as if very little effort was put into its design. Simply molding the mask in a new color plastic would have helped a lot. 

So, Umbra is a pretty weak set with very few bright points. I almost immediately took a lot of the pieces off mine and added on a few of my own, customizing him into something a little more to my liking. I did, however, leave the torso and roller-feet assemblies almost untouched, those, as I mentioned earlier, are pretty well designed.

I wouldn’t really recommend Umbra to anyone, but if you can find him dirt cheap like I did, he’s a good parts set.

"Gus_263","2008-02-27T13:57:55.747Z","Guardian of the mask of life","This is a very cool set, this titan features two light-up weapons, of hewkii and matoro inika, a axe and a sword. The mask is the same of whenua, and the arms and legs are in a cool green. In the colors he also have yellow and some silver pieces. The feet have wheels, and it looks like that he is a fast titan. He also can launch spinner and light-up the eyes. The legs have the pohatu nuva's claws as armors. And more, he have 179 pieces and is tall. A awesome option for titan, but it is exclusive and hard to find. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Umbra was created by the Order of Mata Nui to guard the Ignika. He has the power to transform into a light beam. Umbra's motto is: If they are destined to have the Ignika, they would have to prove it by defeating him. Umbra has been guarding the Ignika for ages. Once he was beaten by Jovan and his team. He has not been beaten again until the Toa Inika came to the Chamber of Life. Umbra fought the Toa Inika, and was beating them, until Matoro created a mirror of Ice, which Umbra deflected off. Umbra is waiting for the Ignika's return.

Pros:
Light up Laser Lance
Light up eyes
Roller skates
Powerless Black Great Kanohi Ruru, Mask of Night Vision
Rhotuka Launcher

Cons:
Bad Colour Scheme
Doesn't stand up very well

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-02T00:40:37.95Z","Bionicle's roller derby champion","<p>I&#39;ll get right to it; this set has some glaring issues. But, no matter how glaring these issues are I can&#39;t bring myself to dislike this set and all of its oddities. Umbra&#39;s name means the darkest inner part of a shadow, and yet he is speckled with the brightest colours at either end of the light spectrum. His skates are supposed to allow him to move incredibly fast. Instead, they end up introducing his face to the ground at incredible speeds. His weapon has the added function of acting like movement-restricting handcuffs. However, even with all of these flaws, Umbra was very fun to build, and continued to baffle and amaze me even after building.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Lots of uniquely coloured pieces (Pohatu claws in yellow, rubber insert pieces in green etc.).</p>

<p>Contains 3 light-up pieces (swords and eyes).</p>

<p>The only set released outside 2005 to have a Rhotuka spinner.</p>

<p>The build is complex, and unique in almost all areas.</p>

<p>Includes a clamp to keep the spinner still.</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>If you were to find the word &#39;Unstable&#39; in a dictionary, a close up image of Umbra&#39;s feet could likely be found on the same page.</p>

<p>Head nearly can&#39;t move because of the way the neck is built and the light-up eye piece.</p>

<p>Arm movement is severely limited by both the shoulder pads and the staff, which requires extensive disassembly to allow Umbra&#39;s arms to move.</p>

<p>The colours are an odd combination to say the least.</p>

<p>7 cell batteries are required for this set. 3 are needed per sword, and one differently sized battery is needed for the eyes.</p>

<p>So, after all of this, I would still recommend Umbra&nbsp;despite its flaws. The set is a strange mix of fun and unique. 3/5</p>
