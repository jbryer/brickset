"greg_duncan","2006-08-19T15:49:38Z","worthy of top marks","Vezon and Fenrahk are a fearsome duo straight from the depths of voya-nui, and an excellent set. For a modest price, you get the coolest piraka, with unique construction and a great two-part mask, and his frightening steed with good parts and a sturdy figure. Together, they make on of the best tag-team sets released so far.

Vezon, the seventh piraka and the first bionicle character to ever feature a cape, is a cool rider in this set. The use of piraka and Inika parts to create an original character is truly fantastic. His staff is spiky, fitting in well with the sharp spines of the other piraka which Vezon lacks, though for some reason it features the only brown part in this set, and looks out of place. His main color scheme is limited to two colors; black and silver, which look nice when contrasted against the reds and metallic colors of his spidery steed. 

Fenrahk, the spider rahi and the larger model of the two is an intimidating presence. With great parts from the piraka and Inika themes and new leg construction make him a great set to own. He is very sturdy in leg design to support the weight of Vezon, and also quite poseable despite the fact. His head also features a new mask piece, and a working chomping jaw, which is fun. Connecting him to his master is a series of new chain pieces, which are good for alternative building.

All in all, I can highly recommend this set. It features many new and exclusive parts, great construction which all ages will enjoy, and really adds two great characters to the bionicle story. It also comes at a very reasonable price, one of the best this year in my opinion.

"legozander","2006-10-25T11:33:04Z","woohoo!","Vezon and fenrakk is  one of the most coolest sets i have ever seen! Vezon has cool light up eyes a cool cape, the ignika mask of life, new armour and an awesome spear of fusion and cool parts. Plus! Did you know vezon means double? Fenrakk is his big sturdy cool steed. He has really cool jaws that open and shut. His body also has four piraka torsos and one red inika armour peice! Fenrakks legs are nice and stong for supporting Vezon but the weapons on the back legs fall off easily.:( Overall vezon and fenrakk are an awesome set and are well worth getting if your a bionicle fan.

"Aleiobot","2007-06-16T19:56:30.59Z","pretty good -","This set is pretty good. It has a cool Piraka with fusion sphere and cape, mask of life, light up eyes, glow in the dark teeth and other cool features like the spider. But it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The legs on the spider aren't very posable and the chain connecting the two guys is pretty short. I also wish the mask of life could come off without the Vezon mask, but over all - it's a good set and if you like Bionicle and are collecting the 2006 ones or evil ones, you should get this set! :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-04T14:41:01.09Z","A great titan","This includes 281 pieces, these makes the piraka vezon and the spider fenrakk. Fenrakk don't looks like a spider, but another creature with  four paws. The teeth have a great system of playability, and the four paws have blades, another features to make this set cool. Armors are also included on fenrakk, like the red of inika. The black piraka body is also included on vezon and fenrakk. Vezon have too the spear of fusion; piraka characteristics; (he is one of them, don't have spine, but a mask)and a mask, double sided, like the krahkan, but this with a side to pirakas and the other is a version of the kanohi ignika. His feet is a black of piraka claw like, he have too a black cover. A chain connects Vezon to fenrakk. This set have playability and fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

the hole in the cape which you connect onto his neck loosens.

"reidak12","2011-12-14T18:14:05.04Z","Monstrous","<p>I bought this set in 07, as the 06 titans were still selling. This has to be my favorite large set. (At least out of the ones that I have) </p>
<p>Vezon: Vezon is a very interesting figure. He is one of only two Bionicles to have a cape, the other being Karzhani. It really fits him, because its ragged and torn. He also has the spear of fusion, which is nice, because its a legendary Bionicle weapon.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>light up eyes 
<li>glow in the dark teeth 
<li>first version of Ignika 
<li>cape 
<li>Spear of Fusion 
<li>More interesting body armor than other Piraka</li></ul>
<p>Fenrakk: Fenrakk is a strange model, because while his front legs are very large and technical, his back ones are small and simple. I would think that a large Rahi like this would have powerful back legs.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>very large 
<li>teeth look great 
<li>front legs</li></ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>back legs are puny 
<li>Chain probably could have been longer</li></ul>
<p>In all, I would say that this is a first-rate Bionicle set. I would try to get it somewhere if I were you.</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,3,3
