Released in 2006, the piraka outpost includes four minifigures of 2006 bionicle characters, kongu, jaller, reidak and thok. These are playable like the robots of the exo force theme and are also in somethings, lego system like. The faces of the minifigures are good designed and these are so much better than the bionicle minifigures of the 2005 playsets. This set includes a &quot;Fenrakk spawn spider, that is in the base, paws and head, good builted, that combines some bionicle pieces like the axonn's mask, some vahki arms as paws, vahki weapons increasing it and also a sphere launcher, above, with lego system pieces, like the plates of the piraka outpost and the plates that connects the parts of the spider. Above the spider, there is a plate, that serve as a &quot;cockpit&quot; for minifigures and carries a sphere launcher. The piraka outpost is basic and above the small gate, there is a cannon in technic style, with in each side, spikes to looks like more bionicle. Altough this set is a small in comparison with other bionicle playsets, this have a very well playability and building.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
