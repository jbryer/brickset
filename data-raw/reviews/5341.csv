"Blade","2007-07-25T11:24:45.38Z","Drop Bridge","Got this set like 2 weeks ago in a toy sale (Normally like $80 here for $40) and haven't had time to build it since. Built it the other day and decided tonight it was time for its review, which it sorely needs.

Firstly I Love it! For play its quite fun and for display looks really good. The ball launchers are very easy to use and come out with alot of force so they can be used to knock alot of stuff over. All the full size bionical masks and weapons help enhance the  sets looks. Lots (8) mini-figs so lots of play ability and colours are aesthetically pleasing. Base Mounts are cool and good for extending other bases you may own and the extended weaponry range for the mini-figs its much needed.

A couple things did annoy me alot. Firstly the lava boards with the launchers are virtually unstable. By this i mean once you actually find the exact point that makes them stand on a flat surface (I used my pool table) you look at them and they fall over. 

I recommend using the stance in the instructions for the mini-figs then raise and twist the launcher so the figs arm rests inside the bent rubber pipe, used for firing, is the most stable.

The other thing that ticked me off was that the extra weapons, which is great, had no home to be stored. No hooks, no anything. What was more annoying was the first page showed the figs with certain weapons and in the finish page, with figs, they are all holding different weapons than the ones from the start! 

If you are having trouble with the bridge not meeting up correct, I got mine dead flat. Simply find a flat surface (Pool table is the best) and simple join model, then twist the chains at the point where the connect to the bridge. the more you turn the chain left or right the higher that corner becomes. Took me about 5 minutes. :)
This really should have been in the instructions.

Overall I still rate this model a 9/10 as these 2 annoyances are just that annoying, but easily overcome.

Would recommend this to anyone bionical fan or not.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2007-10-30T19:29:08.89Z","Not a Bionicle Fan So I Bought the Set For the Dark Blue Bricks","After completing Cafe Corner, I went through my bricks and didn't find many Slope Bricks (75 2 x 1 x 3) to mimic the roof details found in the Cafe Corner. Upon shopping for LEGO, I found this set at an unbelievable discount because it had this particular piece in Dark Blue! There were many Dark blue pieces, 2 large black plates and several chain pieces. At the price I paid, it was well worth it for these bricks/parts. I gave the figures and odd bionicle parts to my wife for her students and they love them. I do not care for the bionicle them at all but the Dark blue bricks were too many to turn down. Now I am in the process of building my own Market Street and the dark blue slope pieces will make up the roof. I can't wait until I finish my MOC. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It is a pretty good set.<br/><br/>pros<br/>plenty of extra Bionicle weapons<br/>2 masks of truth<br/>3 zamor sphere launchers<br/>10 zamor spheres<br/>long technic pegs<br/>flat black plates<br/>mini Bionicle weapons<br/>4 chains<br/>4 silver surfboards<br/><br/>cons<br/>big bottom pieces are almost useless in MOCs (my own creations)<br/>slope bricks are almost useless except for roofs<br/>mini Bionicle figures<br/><br/>Overall, pretty good set. Would probably be better with other mini Bionicle sets. I think that Lego should make something like this for the Star Wars theme. This is a good set to complete your mini Bionicle set collection, or for the bridge, not as the only mini Bionicle set you plan on owning.",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Gus_263","2008-03-28T12:45:39.857Z","Nice bionicle playtheme","This set is one of the bionicle playthemes, that was released in the year of 2006. The minifigures included are not in the original lego style, but in pieces like the robots of the exo force theme, but with some changes in pieces and color, to the minifigures looks like more the bionicle. The minifigures are nicely designed. The gate is good builted, altough some pieces like the two plates under the gate have no much divisions, are solid. The gate is good builted and have some useful pieces like the chains, the pilars that makes the towers and the two black plates that connects the towers, so, useful pieces for more lego sets. Other pieces that are useful for bionicle, are the spheres,sphere launcher, the axonn's mask, brutaka's sword and more. The playability is basic but features some boards for minifigures with the capacity to launch spheres and the gate can open, that makes it looks like more a bridge. In overall, this setis good for Lego system and technic like bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
