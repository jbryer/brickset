It is a really expensive, but mostly because of the mini-figures. It has three main sections; the main tower, the secondary tower, and the piraka head. The towers feature unique base plates, which are too mega-bloky for me, although I am starting to like them. They support the set well, and really lend to the style of it. The piraka head is nice, although the teeth feature is best left alone, as it is kind of fragile. Connecting the parts nicely is a series of silver spines which are very nice and set the piraka theme.

This particular set includes many features, many of them zamor sphere launchers. The main feature of this set is the zamor sphere track, which would work out were it one brick higher on the Brutaka tower’s side, because zamors tend to go the wrong way half the time. Another feature is the “laser”, which is fantastic and an improvement over exo-bricks in that they have studs on top and the battery CAN be replaced, much like the Inika tools. It really adds something special to the set.

An improvement over last year’s playsets in terms of mini-figures, this set sports all twelve, each with moving parts. Most of them look like their canister counterparts, with the exception of Zaktan, who should have two horns on his head since all the spines are identical, and Hewkii, who doesn’t have as much yellow in his large form. It is interesting to note that no pictures other than the instructions show the correct tools for the characters, but they really suit the figures well in my opinion.

All in all, I must say that this set is great, except for the price, which is WAY too high, probably because of the mini-figures. I would recommend this set, but I recommend buying it on sale, because the set isn’t worth the original price.
