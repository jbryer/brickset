Enthousiastic about the return of the original track links, I went to the store where it was on display, to check out the features and price.
......Both turned out to be a BIG dissappointment, it costs a stunning 69,95 euro (while lego.com offers it for 54,95) but that wasn't the worst.

The only real technic features on this model are the gearings used to operate the winches (and indirectly raise and lower the boom perhaps).
Other then that, it's just a lego-system kit that consists out of technic beams.
For that price, and for the title &quot;technic&quot; they could and SHOULD have done a better job, like a 9V motor to operate the winches, and to operate the turntable.
It does contain a lot of technic beams, and a fair amount of track links so for someone who's looking for spare parts, this kit could provide you with some if your willing to pay the price for a job poor done. (and if you like the ugly studless-beam construction).
This model also looks bigger then it actally is, when I held the box in my hands... I was surprised about the low weight of it; giving me a feeling of &quot;don't fall for it&quot;.

Eventhough i'm a lego-fan (I even slowly start to accept the studless beams), I can't say that lego is doing a good job with sets like these.
They are too expensive, even the track links cannot make up for that..  and if they release a set under the name &quot;technic&quot;  then it should be a REAL technic set.

C'mon LEGO.... I'm a fan of your products for years, I know you can do better then this!!! ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Pros:
-Very cool looking
-Lots of features, making it very realistic.
-Those 'weight bricks' in the back are nice.
-Alternative model (high rise crane) is even better in my opinion.

Cons:
-Can't pick up too much weight.
-It's loud when turning those cranks.
-The tracks don't move to easy, making it hard to push.
-A little flimsy in certain situations.


Overall this is my favorite Technic set of 2006. It took me several months before I got bored with it and finally put it on my shelf. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"the_squid","2009-07-03T13:22:24.06Z","Great but can be improved","When I first spotted this one, I knew I wanted to have one.

It's a very nice build, not challenging but when you put all booms on it's an impressive crane.
I find the alternative boom even better then the normal one...

There's only 1 point where there's a big space of improvement: The base with tracks. 
The small black tracks are a little too small compared to the rest of the base, therefor making the base fragile.

I replaced the base with tracks with the one from the 8294 excavator to solve the first point. This improves the total stability of the crane (not rocking on the base)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
