"Monty","2006-07-17T12:22:16Z","Addendum to previous review.","After a couple of days I noticed when using the steering at full lock the hood jumping upwards a little due to the wheel catching the rear of the wheel arch/fender. The obvious solution is to move the mounting brackets back one hole. It seems there is a mistake in the instructions as it tells you to attatch the connector/bracket leaving 3 holes from the rear of the beam, whereas subsequent drawings and the box art show it only 2 holes from the end - which is necessary to prevent the problem.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"aaron","2006-09-20T23:15:44Z","Just sort of ho hum, and average","Overall Value: 3 (cost+aesthetics+features+build)/4:  I had high expectations for this set, but the overall experience was mediocre at best. Yes it is big, but quality is always much more important than quantity. This set really does not have that much going for it, everything it does have, has been done before, and better in earlier models.  It good kit to buy if you need parts, but it is not great for new inspiration, or even for sitting on your bookshelf, it is flimsy and average
----------
Cost: 5 :  This set is very good value, for the parts
$0.06 per element ($120.00 US / 1877 elements) 

Aesthetics and Details: 3 :  This set is about the same size as the Model team Truck 5571, but that is where the comparisons end this set is more like the Technic 8436 Truck than any thing else there was a bit of a lost opportunity here, it would have been nice to see more thought go into the wheel arches, cab, and the mechanisms, not terrible but not great either

Elements: Standard technic parts, nothing new here, you do get a pneumatic cylinder set up, a damped cylinder, 2 extra long axles, and 10 ( 62.4 x 20 S ) wheels, 4 are gray, 6 are silver

Features / Details: 2 : Again same old technic stuff nothing really that exciting or new

Primary Vehicle:
Engine / Drivetrain: 6 cylinder engine directly driven from one bank of rear wheels / The other bank of wheels are idle, I don’t like when LEGO does this, it feels like they are too cheap to include 1 more differential to drive all the wheel banks and make it some what more realistic
Transmission: None
Suspension: None
Steering: Hand of God from top of cab, internal wheel is not linked
Additional Actuations: Cab doors open, and the hood/bonnet opens

Auxiliary Components:
Crane: Can be raised and lowered, the boom can be deployed along with the winch, 
(The crane does not rotate)
Deployable stabilizer booms: Hand of God from top of cab
(These are pointless for this model, and feel as if they were added as a result of a marketing focus group) 
Deployable tow platform with damped cylinder
Pneumatic lift for tow platform
Panels on either side of the cab extension open to reveal the crane controls

Build: 2: I am sorry to say, but this build was a little dull for me, it wasn’t that clever with the packaging of components, or with the approach to the mechanisms

Every year LEGO comes out with an “ultimate” technic set that is challenging, interesting and a great learning experience, sadly this set missed the mark and is essentially a bigger reissue of the 8462 tow truck with less creative input, however to be fair, last year’s 8421 mobile crane was a tough act to follow. Let’s keep our fingers crossed for 2007

"moloko","2007-09-11T15:03:28.547Z","Favorite Technic Set ","This is by far my favorite one to build and show.  It took me a total of 9 hours to build.  Not to much repetition to make it boring.  It was a pleasure to build.  There are so many moving parts.

Pros: 

size ( its huge)
10 wheels included ( im a lego wheel fan)
tons of technic parts/ moving 


Cons:

front hood seems a little delicate
I wish it had the extended cab with bed
Could use more chrome in the outside of the cab.


Is it worth it?  YES 119$ on lego shop.  Best deal right now.

"Nitrium","2007-12-11T10:27:30.857Z","Excellent set.","I bought this set on 15/11 and was really happy doing so. It was a blast to build. It has a lot of &quot;features&quot; and nice concepts - extending/retracting the lifting hook bar, pneumatics for the rear platform and other nice little touches. I've put the 8287 motor on it to lift/retract the hook and it worked nice. My next task will be to build another truck of the pieces, as the set is very big with big tires. My only complaint is that you have to stick some decals on the pieces, which I didn't do because I hate to make the bricks &quot;dirty&quot;. Recommended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"violinista03","2008-01-09T22:43:30.403Z","Great Set","I was into legos during the mid 90's when I was 12 or so but other things came up (like middle and high school)and I did set aside my Lego's for a long time. For some reason I was browsing the web this holiday season and found this Lego truck on amazon.com. It immediately brought back memories of my lego building days and I knew I had to get back to Lego Technic. I got the tow truck for xmas and I spent about 10 hours (with breaks) building it. The truck itself looks great and is very big. All the features are excellent and work very well. I wish thata second differential had been added to the rear axle but there wasn't much space left because of the pneumatic cylinder. As noted in other reviews there is some color variation among the red beams. I have not yet built the secondary model and am not planning to at the moment. I would like the try the new power functions motors to the main model and control it with the remote. Overall a very nice, and playable set.
 
ps. If anyone wants to get rid of their older, complete sets (like 8479, 8480, 8431, 8438, 8454, 8455, 8464, 8868 and 8880) I am interested and would pay well for them.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"thebrickbuster","2008-08-15T06:11:26.25Z","Awsome","I've been wanting this set ever since it was released.I got this set for my birthday recently and was stoked when it came in the post.This set would be one of my largest sets and took many hours to build.
The scale of the truck is just massive.I love all the moving and working parts.The pistons and fan belt of the motor,the steering,the boom lifting and extending and the hydraulics that operate the wheel clamps at the back.
The overall detail is perfect and the discrete controls meld into the model very well.
I previously hadn't been a big Technic fan but this set has opened my eyes to the possibilities with Technic.
It's a very complex and advanced build and very much worth the money.You won't be dissapointed.
One of my top 5 sets.

"hustla187","2009-01-08T20:06:21.013Z","Beautiful Model","This set really reminds me of the old Model Team sets Lego used to make. This is a perfect successor to the Model Team sets because it is detail to the final pieces and and is in Model Team scale. The tow truck is really amazing and it looks flawless from top to bottom. At least 20 years from now, this set will be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bizkit","2008-09-20T14:55:13.013Z","2 amazing trucks in 1 set!","It was my first set that I bought after a really long time, almost 12 years. It's the biggest set I own, at the moment, obviously because I payed for it :), in the past I only got smaller sets. I was astound when I opened the carton that contained the Lego box, it was a huge box, the set would have nicely fitted in in a box half of its size.
I had to think a lot were to put the box.
The 1877 pieces were packed in 24 plastic bags, unfortunately all unmarked; that gave me a headache while I was building. Some pieces were marvelous, I have never seen some of them: metallic-silver parts(although not all parts, that should have been metallic silver, were metallic-silver: wheels, some pin joiners), the pneumatic system(could have used more pneumatic cylinders, but still it's OK), metallic hook, and many others.
I started building the second model first(both are great), took me about 7 hours, mainly because I'm not used to this new building system, based on beams(lift-arms) with holes, rather then bricks with holes(which were used in great numbers at the beginnings of the 90s). The new building system makes the models nicer, they are rounded off, but it seems to me it's harder to create with them, not to mention taking them apart is also harder. But.. 
The result was simply marvelous, its the best designed Technic I've ever seen, with many functions. Those who made this should be really proud o themselves. Thank you!

"krautboy","2009-04-14T18:57:45.873Z","awesome!","After building it,taking it apart and rebuilding the B-model all in all it's an amazing set.
What the previous people wrote about the B-model may be true,but they didn't mention the size and awesomenese.
It's a beautiful scale model,and like all lego models it functions only to a certain degree.If you want to motorize it just be creative,and have a stack of lego to do so.
If you don't have enough lego be creative and shorten the length,or let out the crane,that's what lego is all about.This is really one of the best sets ever made,get it if you can !
P.s.
Sticker it if you just gonna save it for A and B model,it doesnt require to remove any of them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"aldredd","2009-03-25T09:46:36.467Z","The B Model lets it down","OK, don't get me wrong, this model is fantastic. If I was only reviewing the 'A' model, it would get 5/5 without a doubt. But seeing as the 'B' model hasn't been mentioned much, I though I'd focus more on that than the 'A' model - there isn't really anything I can add to that which hasn't been said already.

To start, it's very disappointing that the (optional, and expensive) motor set is only compatible with the 'B' model, and not the 'A' model. But I bought it knowing this. So after many hours taking the other model apart, I built the second model. It was OK - quite large and well detailed, but just didn't have the same 'wow' factor as the first model. It also left many parts unused - including the damper. I wasn't happy with the model, but though things may improve when I added the motor set and it's 96(approx) pieces.
Another disappointment. Other than the motor & battery box, it only used a few extra pieces from this set, and really didn't add a lot to the overall finish.
Add to that, the fact that they don't even manage to find a way to secure the battery box to the model, instead it's separate, and connected via the cable - looks a mess.
I spent a bit of time trying to modify the model to accommodate the battery box (with some success) but eventually gave up, took it apart and re-built the A model.

By all means get this set - it's fantastic, but I really wouldn't bother with the B model or motor set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lexhoya","2009-04-01T07:48:55.687Z","Also the review of the B-model","Like aldredd mentioned the B-model is not discussed much, but this is not done for most sets. I do not have the motorset that can be used to automate the set, but I will not buy it for this one. The set on itself, both models are really cool and impressive if you build them and put them on a tabel.
What disappoints me most is the studiness of the cranes. They both can not handle a lot of loads (in fact most models are too heavy for the mechanism to handle) and the wire that comes with the set broke a few times, it is replaced by me for a normal cotton wire 0,3 mm gauge (a bit heavier). Now it at least can hold a model in the air, but it still tips over when something heavy is lifted.

Apart from this set, I really would appreciate it if Lego reintroduces the separate sets again with the different technic parts. There are only 2 in NL and they only contain axles and joints... Anyone else for this to be done?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Sebbl","2014-03-17T17:40:11.913Z","Not as good as expected","<p>Bought this set when I was 18. It&#39;s the biggest set I own.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Disappointingly there are just few special technic parts like the two 32-axles, the gear racks, the damper, the hook and the pneumatic parts. The other parts are either special but no technic parts, or just usual technic parts which can be found in small sets too. In a nutshell, I could have spent my money much better!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building experience was actually good and challenging.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks great and the few functions it has are working well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Just an expensive good looking truck with few special parts and functions. I have been much more satisfied by less expensive sets like the excavator 42006.</p>
