"_add_um","2007-03-25T09:38:49.92Z","ALL RIGHT","I like this nice minfigs comes with cool acceseries. Theres 24 door to open and only the last door has something to do with Xmas. (santa with a fire place,a tree and a box) The Santa should have red legs not grey legs. In some doors you nice stuff like hospital bed,telephone and road barriers. Nice minifigs are ok  which added to police and fire stations and my airport. I can't wait for 2007 one!! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

its a pity there's no way to collect those ideas, i.e. there are no instructions for all doors, just a small pic on the back of each door. and who would keep the whole empty box just as a reference? a final instruction sheet that summarizes the whole content would have been a good idea.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
