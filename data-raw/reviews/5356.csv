"ratz","2007-03-31T05:43:27.113Z","good for kids","i got this set for my kids, and it seems that they really enjoy playing with it. the dragon is really huge, bigger than a duplo dragon, and the catapult ist quite stable and works fine. especially the rocks that open on impact are a nice touch.
to myself the set is rather superfluous, it has too many big (bionicle-) parts, although some useful brown stuff is involved. i would not recommend the set as a part supply, but for playing purposes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"smiley905","2007-12-05T11:04:31.763Z","better than it looks","this set seems way over price when you see it in the store (its still might be a little too much) but when you get it together its fabulous! the dragons great, its realy big has cool armor and i like the flames. the on thing i think needs in provement is the hands and legs. the catupult is probably the best working one so far it can go across my bedroom, just the bolders break open when i do that.

its a great set but i think i little to much but its probably worth it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The catapult is pretty good, but I have to say I was disappointed. It isn't as detailed as the vikings' artillery, and it isn't very heavily armored. I recommend this set because it is very fun to play with (If you play with your legos)and there are good minifigures and a cool dragon. The catapult mechanism is fine, but I am actually VERY disappointed with the wagon part of it. Otherwise, it's great, and I know people may read this and start shouting at me for writing this review, but I am just voicing my opinion.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2010-05-30T14:33:25.137Z","A big spikey catapult and an armored dragon","<p>I do believe his was one of the last Vikings sets that I got (however I do want the Midgard Serpent and Viking Ship). I'm really happy with how this set turned out.</p>
<p>The building experience was good. But since I don't quite remember it, I'll go over the flaws. The catapult doesn't have many flaws, but the spears and spikes can get loose and fall off. The dragon has the biggest problem. Alot of parts on him are loosely placed bricks that fall off easily. They have no reinforcement. Also, the flame is pretty big, so you have to take it out when not using it. With the smaller dragons, I angled the flame pieces on the roof of its mouth so I wouldn't have to take it out. </p>
<p>Minifigs are good. They have nice weapons and armor. Unfortunatly, the helmets are a loose fit and will fall off sometimes.</p>
<p>I'll cover the catapult first. It has a very nice look to it. The dragon skull on the front is particularly nice. It shows that this is a nearly unstoppable machine. It also has big wheels&nbsp;and enough room for the vikings to stand around. The catapults are also pretty cool. Instead of pushing down to fire them, you pull up. They also have what looks like a weight which is a nice touch of realism.</p>
<p>The dragon is gorgeous. I do especially like the blue and silver color with the yellow on the wings. The neck could have been a bit more poseable, but it works. There's not much really to say. The tail has some smaller wings and also looks pretty nice. I'm glad they decided to give him built back legs. If he had small legs like his arms, I'd be mad. There's not much to say about the wings except aim for them. They are really the only things that aren't armored. What I do find weird is that the dragon hs a seat and chains. It appears that the vikings are supposed to be riding it, not fighting it. Unless they tried to tame it.</p>
<p>Overall, this set is great. Despite the loose parts, I'd still recommend it. 40 dollars is an excellent price to pay for it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"jeroenaa95","2012-06-02T06:57:05.837Z","great set!","<p>I got this set for my 11th birthday and I have built it immediately. It is a great set with an enormous dragon and a huge catapult that shoots at least 6 meters (if you do it right). </p>
<p>It is a great siege engine and I use it that way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>- Huge dragon with armorplates.</p>
<p>- Great catapult that shoots really far.</p>
<p>- 3 minifigs: 1 viking with shield and long spear, 1 viking with shield and large axe and 1 viking with just a large axe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>- little too expensive in my opinion.</p>
<p>- no other cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall a great set. You have to get this set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Ernst","2013-04-01T10:25:10.62Z","Castle, Bionicle & Technic united gives Vikings set 7021.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong>: This Viking set is when finished a Castle orientated result although the built is mostly influenced by Technic and Bionicle. So in fact Lego succeeded with the Viking theme and particularly this set to capture 3 building techniques in one. The result is a good looking Dragon&nbsp;and sufficiently working&nbsp;Catapult with 3 good looking Viking warriors. Definitely a recommendable set over all and for those who want to experience all building techniques Lego offers.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong>: Like mentioned before, all Lego building techniques come together. You start with the dragon which is a 100% Bionicle built. It is fun doing (although I&#39;m not a Bionicle fan) and not too hard, the result is great looking and well balanced Dragon. The catapult is some 20% normal building and 80% Technic. It requires more attention than the dragon but is fun building. The result looks great and shooting is possible but not &nbsp;the the easiest Catapult to fire.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;3 bricks</strong>: The set offers 3 great Vikings with weapons and shields and 4 more shields. For Castle fans a lot of brown parts including 2 with a great print on it. The bionicle&nbsp;parts used for the Dragon and much of the Technic parts are good but hard to use in Castle orientated MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: The set being built offers great playability on its own and even more added to your other Viking or Castle sets.</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;5 bricks</strong>: Viking sets are not the easiest to find, considering that argument the average used price offered on<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=7021-1""> Bricklink</a> of &euro;33,00 is ok I guess. It is about equal to the price when sold new. It is the price I paid too and I think it will increase in value in time.</p>
