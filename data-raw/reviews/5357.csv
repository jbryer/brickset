"omgbrick","2007-08-07T23:17:08.083Z","Supersized 7017","theres one word to describe this set HUGE it comes with 7 vikings plus weapons and sheilds for all and a flag bearer. I had no idea how the shooting function  would work take my word for it it works great. Theres ten bolts for it so theres lots of ammo to kill a pack of wolves or something. theres also a intersing place where you can store a keg of beer two goblets and a chest of jewels.This set is also a bit more realistic in a way as the vikings have too pull it into battle unlike 7017 where it has too be magicly moved around by two guys. theres only a little juniorization (wheels)
For 45 dollars its a 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zek","2008-03-24T04:20:11.983Z","The Vikings are coming","       This set is excellent comes with 7 detailed men with lots of weapons, great if you a wanting to build a viking army. The missle system works well and is different to the common catapult system which has been used in many lego sets. For its price its good value for money and a wonderfull addition to a viking army.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2008-07-30T21:34:46.403Z","i am glad i got this set!","this is an amazing set. theres not much to say about it because the other reviews really say it all. I love this set. It goes really well with the big viking ship 'cause the ship doesnt come with enough people to man the whole ship, but if you take the vikings from the heavy artillery and put them on the ship, it works great. I love this set. it is a great buy, and i actually got it from ebay for less of the price than lego used to sell it for. this is definitely a great buy.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-03T14:50:48.31Z","Heave ho! Down the moors we go!","This is probably one of the best Battle Packs next to the Star Wars Clone Troopers Battle Pack. This set has a whole army of Vikings and each of them has weapons and armor that are great, especially the large Viking decorated shields. Also this set has a better and more complete vehicle than in other Battle Packs, albeit having lack of seats for the Viking army except for the Viking King (?). With 7 minifigs at a nice price, you can't pass this up!

"rocketscience20","2008-11-14T15:56:16.687Z","nice set","this is a very nice set. i like the vikings and their weapons. the jewels in the chest and the wine barrel with the goblets are sweet. the torches absolutely rock!   

    pros-1.all the minifigures
         2.the weapons
         3.the little removable tray w\ the wine and jewels
         4.the launching torches
       
    cons-1.the bracket that holds the torches falls off a lot
other than that its a very nice set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kcrmccoy","2009-06-14T22:50:47.14Z","Backup is on the way!","Got this set the Christmas of '06, let's break it down.

Building - Simple and fast. No really confusing parts. 10/10

Accessories - Tons, you've got shields, swords, axes, wine glasses, etc. It has a really good amount. 10/10

Minifigures - Not very many rare ones unless you consider the golden helmet one. Otherwise, the minifigures are a great addition to your viking horde. 10/10

Playability - This is where it starts to fail. Although it's really cool, this set is only good if you have a enemy (Dragon or Creature). Standing alone, there's only so much you can do with it. 7.5/10

Price - Average. For about $30 (USD) for 312 pieces, you get a good average of around 10? (USD) per piece. 10/10

PROS:
- Tons of Minifigs w/ accessories
- Double launcher is amazing
- Front is detachable
- The price is right

CONS:
- Wish there was a place in the back of the wagon for every viking to ride without pushing.
- No enemy

This set is a great 9.5!

In conclusion, get this set if you have a dragon waiting for it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kipper147","2011-01-21T09:09:09.293Z","one of the best sets i every purchased","okay, well a couple years ago (around the time that viking sets were being taken off the shelves) i found this set in an out of the way KBtoys outlet.&nbsp; it was $15-20 USD, and i was amazed! this set comes with so many people for the price i got it for, it was unbelieveable!<br/><br/>If you can find this set for &lt;$20 buy it!",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Hylocera","2010-04-15T23:54:44.653Z","Attack of the Vikings!","<p>&nbsp;This is one of the many sets that I own that now lies in a bin of LEGOs. Although I demolished this set quite a while algo, I still remember some really cool parts on this set.</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Cool parts</li>
<li>2. Uses brown elements, which I haven't seen done in many other non-Viking sets</li>
<li>3. Missile system is an awesome touch</li>
<li>4. Has cool design</li>
<li>5. Looks great</li>
<li>6. ENORMOUS amount of minifigures for its price</li>
<li>7. Lots of accesories, and a pair of goblets complete with treasure</li></ul>
<p>CONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Overpriced (I was thinking $20.00-$30.00)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The things that push down the triggers to fire the missiles flip without doing anything a lot</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Minifigures easily flip if the thing isn't on the ground</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Minifigures are dragged along the floor when moving (On carpet)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in other words, If you're looking for a set with a ton of minifigures with cool helmets, buy this one, but NOT if you're looking for something well priced.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,3
"Orange_Lemons","2011-02-24T18:18:02.603Z","Fantastic!","This set still holds as one of my all-time favortie sets. The double automatic firing is great and one of the best parts. The huge army of vikings defintiely makes this a set worth getting. A nice touch would be if there were horses or some creature pulling the wagon, but nothing seriously wrong here. An enemy would be nice too, but when you have all the Viking sets (like myself) this is amazing. One of my best purchases to date, unfortunately, these are no longer available through retail and are overpriced, but if you can pick one up cheap, buy it!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"jeroenaa95","2012-05-31T06:34:48.363Z","great army builder and cool catapult.","<p>I got this set in 2006 in Denmark, Billund I guess. It is almost 6 years ago I bought it, but I still love this set. I have all the vikings sets, except the chess set. I am trying to get that too. You get 6 common vikings and 1 who leads them in battle. There is no enemy in this set,&nbsp;and I do think that is&nbsp;a problem. You get 7 minifigs and a large catapult for about&nbsp;â‚¬30,&nbsp;and I don't think that is too expensive. If you like the vikings series and you don't have it yet, please get this set, because you get a lot&nbsp;vikings in this set. The only downside is that there is no enemy in this set, but if you have other viking sets, you have a lot of enemies. It is a good extension to the large catapult in set 7021, wich comes with a large dragon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a good set, not too expensive, great minifigs. </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
