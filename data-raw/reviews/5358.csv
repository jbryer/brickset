What do you do with your Tiny Turbos once they are built? Why, you put them on the roof of a Tuner Garage, that's what! The set comes with 4 Tiny Turbos, 1 of which is a new design, 2 are tweaks of earlier designs (a yellow Flame Glider and Lime Tuner-X). The other car is the Highway Enforcer. It would have been nice to get different cars completely but the new colors and slight tweaks are acceptable. The Garage itself is awesome. It is stocked with extra sets of wheels, off road wheels, rims, nitro, a checkerboard roof, a car on the roof, mechanic bays, and Technic Slammers that when used send your Racers flying. This set is a nice addition to the Racers line up and to my collection. It will serve as the inspiration for a much larger MOC Tuner Garage that I will build to house my Tiny Turbos collection.

"EXO_FORCE","2009-01-29T05:12:34.733Z","Hmmm.... Still graded as AWESOME","Finally i get my personal garage at the end of 2008.
This one is an awesome set for those who love Tiny Turbo.
It is a MUST for you! First of all... TLG solve  those weird mudguard
problem that appeared on the previous Hot Rod set. Although this rod use less part, but it makes it looks closer to the real thing!

Next, what i must point out is that lime tuner. Most of them say that the lime tuner is the bro of the 8666. I disagree this strongly, why? After i finish this set, i compare the lime tuner to the 8666, i found that this one looks more similar to a hot hatch rather than the 8666.

Then the red cabrio. Some minor complain here:Seems like TLG ran out of idea when designing this set. The rear light just looks same to the lime one, the Trans-Red 1x1 Brick just placed above the exhaust! It looks ugly and weird!
Same problem goes to the lime one also[Luckily the 8666 don't have such problem] Besides, the windshield should be 1 stud higher, as it looks quite strange now!

Conclusion
PROS:
5 Cars to fill up your garage
Great parts!
Very good rod design[TLG even use this hot rod in 8154 with sa\ome minor changes]
some rare bricks
>1x16 brick[6x of'em]

CONS
Sticker!! Some of them are quite big!
Launcher![Maybe i'm not a fans of HotWheels]


Total Marks: 4.5 STARS
