"aaron","2006-09-07T23:11:23Z"," A good update to the Technic F1 line. ","Overall Value: 3.75 (cost+aesthetics+features+build)/4: This is a very well designed model with nice detailing, however save your pennies, it is really expensive! 

----------
Cost: 1 :  I don’t know if this is a licensing thing with Ferrari, or what...,  but this set is pricy!!
$0.11 per element ($140.00 US / 1246 elements) ouch!

Aesthetics and Details: 5 : This is a very cool model of an F1 car, The assembly is also more accurate to real F1 cars (much more authentic than 8458, or the Williams set 8461), you first build up the front monocoque, then the engine and rear drivetrain mount as a module to the monocoque, with the engine as a partially stressed element, the engine fairing, as well as the front and rear wings are then added to this chassis. I really like the modular nature of these components; it gives the model a lot of flexibility to modify the look, without compromising the structural integrity of the vehicle.  

That said I had one minor aesthetic complaint, I don’t understand why LEGO choose to use gray connector elements across the front wing. The fairing wings are white, the cross bars are white, but the 6 axle extenders and 2 connector pins are gray?!! 

Form/Function: This is a large model with great styling, the suspension is more elegant than in earlier models, but functions in pretty much the same way, it uses fewer parts and is more robust.

Elements: Standard technic parts, nothing new here, you do however get quite a few faring panels, a full setup of the nice wish bone suspension elements, and  the bigger wheel and tire setup. 

Features / Details: 4 : 
Engine / Drivetrain: 10 cylinder engine with cowling directly driven from the rear wheels / No gear box ( a multi speed linear shift transmission would be fun add to this model)
4 wheel independent suspension
Steering and F1 styled steering wheel

Build: 5: This is a fun and clever build; I really liked this set and admired the construction techniques.

"Monty","2007-03-01T07:48:17.23Z","Not quite in pole position.","I was previously quite happy with the Technic Ferrari F1 1:10 scale 8386, but when I saw this was going to replace it, I just had to get it as soon as it was released. Despite this initial rush of enthusiasm, I have only built it recently. It was another lengthy and intriguing Technic build taking several sessions over a couple of weeks, (often interrupted by the cat – why do they do that? – have you seen how many cats are featured on the Brickshelf site?), which made it very enjoyable for me. Much as it is nice to complete a model, when it’s built it’s built – unless you then begin tweaking which is a slippery slope as where do you stop – it’s like a painting when do you know it’s finished – could you still improve on something? It is noticeably much larger and more accurate than its predecessor and certainly looks the part. From the styling, stickers and the fact it still has a V10 engine I think it is based on the 2005 F1 model. 

The previous reviewer has mentioned the modular construction technique and main features. The main new feature over its predecessor is the better looking and more accurate working front and rear suspension. I understand this is the same as on 8458 and 8461 (which I do not own), but I thought it was a complex piece of construction for something that hardly moves. Steering, engine and transmission/differential work pretty well the same as before. The body over the engine does not pivot up assisted by hydraulics, which I understand those on 8458 and 8461 did, but really just lifts up a little at the rear and is then totally detachable as before.

I should mention there is a mistake in the instructions. At step 46 it tells you to fit the handed radiators to the wrong sides. It is pretty obvious before you fit them that that they should not fit like that, but if you do try it you will find you cannot go on to the next stage without changing them over. 

The detachable (very authentic) front nose/wing assembly is quite accurate, but I am not convinced the attachment of the wing to the nose looks as authentic as before. I definitely agree that it would have been better to use white pins and connectors for the front white wing. This leads me to another observation. I know Lego could never reproduce the cigarette manufacturer’s sponsor’s adverts, but for the most part these are set on a white background, which could be reproduced. The rear wing and part of the rear spine of the model including the lower little wing aft of the engine intake (missing) would be better in white than red. I also feel the deflectors in front of the side air intakes would also be better in white too – still it will give me something to do to personalise/customise the model. 

Silver wheels are nice, but unlike 8461 there is no printing for manufacturer’s names on the walls of the large tyres, which is a pity as it is a very distinctive feature of F1 cars. No alternative number is provided, but as it is quite expensive, I doubt many people will buy 2 sets so need another.  

Overall, I enjoyed this build and it does turn into a pretty faithful replica, but if it were a MOC I would have done some details differently. It is expensive at 100 GBP and I am not sure it will become quite the icon 8386 became – Lego used it on much of their publicity material including over the Lego shelves in Toys R Us. Having built it, for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on, I am not really left with a feeling of &quot;wow&quot; when i look at it, so I feel I cannot give it a maximum score especially for the price – cheaper things, like the 8285 Tow Truck have impressed me far more more so I will give it a 4.

"rosco_pc","2007-05-10T12:57:02.87Z","Slightly more than a studless conversion","All the mechanisms, suspensions, steering, transmission are very similar to the old sets 8458 and 8461, but &quot;converted&quot; using studless liftarms.
Main differences are in the studless steering rack (similar to the 8436 one).
The engine is now at a lower elevation, but it's still a V10, so this model should represent the F2005, also considering the presence of the small additional wing in the front.
The wings are... empty, just contoured with axles and some technic panel: &quot;old&quot; plates and tiles have been used for the rear wing sides, just to admit that a pure studless desing is not adequate!
Also the flat bodywork facing the ground is only contoured, while the bottom of the car is completely open.
The overall appearance is good, with a tight location of many panels, but the framework-like feeling is worse than in the past because of the empty spaces close to the cockpit and the front nose.
No winglets or chimneys.
The proportions of the real F1 car are still very different: front and rear tracks are too wide, suspension arms are wishbone type instead of triangular (one arm should be perpendicular to the car body), the nose is low and without keel in the bottom, there is any diffuser in the back...

The engine cover now cannot be lifted as in the old models, but only removed.
Finally, the rims are painted in a flat silver color but just on the external side, while the internal side is in the original light bluish gray: what a shame, just to save few cents on a set that costs 149 euros!!!

Good enough if you are not a purist F1 fan.

"sarin","2007-04-21T07:10:55.663Z","One of the best supercar sets ever..  one of the worst prices ever.","
I have to start off with saying, I don't own this set myself (unfortunately).
A friend of mine (someone with a VERY good job) was crazy enough to spend 140 euro's on it (about 150-160 USD or 100 GBP).

I helped assembling it, discovering all the features  and I got a very enthousiastic impulse.
I wanted to have it 'cause it's certainly a nice set, even for the modern lego-standards (studless beams, pre-fabricated sideplates etc).
The engine is nicely done (eventhough there's no transmission), the wishbone suspension is awesome, and the amount of detail makes it more a model for display then a toy.

But I wasn't capable of paying the relative tremendous amount of money for a box of plastic parts.
So here I am today... still wanting the supercar, still hating the price.
(A thing most peeps will recognize with most technic sets).

It's really a shame actually, to make such a nice set that pricy..  i'm willing to pay good money for a good set..  but not THAT much, since LEGO is still classified as a (kids)toy and not a specific hobby like model-trains (how on earth is a kid gonna be able to raise that amount of money within the timespan that the set is for sale).
This problem occured to me in '94 -'95 as well with the 8880 supercar.

So I did what almost every kids does these days..  I passed by on the lego-department of the toystore, and walked directly to the videogame section.
(I feel a bit like a traitor to my own nostalgious feelings, but hey..  what am I suppost to do with these prices).

So much about the wining about the price,
like I said..  this set is really awsome, but you have to ask yourself &quot;is it worth to dig this deep, for a &quot;toy&quot; &quot;?
It's fun and challenging to build it once..  but will you enjoy it as much a 2nd time you build it?
I know from my own lego experience that the challenge is severely reduced if you build a model for the second time..  that ain't worth 140 eu's.

 Model/features/parts: 5/5

 Price: 1/5  (-1/5 actually)

 Average: 3/5  

 sorry my fellow LEGO-fans, but I can't make any more of it..  blame it on     the company.

"Lola","2009-04-29T06:45:21.64Z","OK set, if you don't mind the money","When it comes to the Ferrari Franchise thing between Lego and the automaker, I must say that as Ferrari's boss, I would be disappointed. Lego has a history of fabulous Supercar models with insane gearboxes, all-round suspensions, 4-wheel steering/driving and the like while the present-day Plastic Ferrari range is just that, glorified plastic: no suspensions, no gearboxes; the shape is there but that's all there is.

This set is the only one which comes close to paying decent honours to the Italian brand and Technics pedagogic tradition, with a quite realistic F! model of suspension (albeit that doesn't exactly belong to this particular F1 car). It has in-board springs actuated by levers just as the real thing does to allow better aerodynamics. Shame for the gearbox though, but at least here we have a steering wheel that is actually steering the car, unlike many other recent models including the as-expensive 8285.

Build is straightforward, the Replica Model type of job meaning there is quite no room for modification, but pleasant, especially for the suspension part which is nice to play with; tires are massive affairs with good traction and design (and only one-sided painted rims, which as pointed already is a shame too, really).

As a standalone model it does catch the eye, being low, red, long, red, streamlined-but-complicated at the same time. And red, of course. The assembly is quite sturdy, but don't expect it to survive a good CrashAtBrandsHatch session staged by your 6-year old.


A definitive set to buy if you fancy the Model-on-a-Shelf type of realisation, and only if you find it at a sale/auction/discount opportunity.

"Dentarthurdent","2009-03-04T23:25:48.45Z","Absolutely Stunning!","The Ferrari F1 1:8 faced much cynicism and dismay upon release primarily due to the lack of success of the previous versions of the legendary race car. Certainly, such dismal views were laid to rest in my heart when I finally put to together this awesome set in a matter of three-and-a-half hours.

There are a number of features that are worth mentioning - the detachable nose, spoiler and engine cover (call them what you may), the working suspension, complete with springs, and of course the steering function. All of  these combined result in a stunning package. The length, a staggering 60+cm, complements the low slung design of the car, giving it a sporty, realistic look. Although the final product appears a lot more raw and considerably brighter than the advertised images (e.g. above) it is still a pleasurable sight, if not more than these doctored photos. For instance, I could sit a whole fifteen minutes just looking at the car - it is that magnificent!

What amazes me most is the sheer size of the thing. I certainly felt a bit ripped off when I first purchased the set, but having built it I believe it's worth its AUS$200 price tag. It's the ultimate Lego +Ferrari+car fan's dream. If you are at least two of these, I recommend you buy it. It is definitely my favorite set to date (much nicer than the new and old Ferrari F1s of all sizes) and I think it will be yours too if you spend the time to appreciate it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
