"greg_duncan","2006-09-24T12:50:32Z","One of the best sets of the year","The fire nation ship is a sight to behold. Sporting 722 pieces, this is a Lego set that has great features, a good selection (and amount) of parts, 5 truly excellent mini-figures, and a construction that is both sturdy and stylish. This set is probably the second best set at this price range, behind 7707, and well worth its American price.

I must give credit to the Lego Company that they built the hull up brick by brick as opposed to making a huge hull piece, much like the Viking longboat or the Durmstrang ship, which are the two most recent examples. Because of this, the set is far sturdier and can support all of the features above it, like the tower, and the smokestacks. In the hull, though, there is a little area for coal (black and trans-orange studs) and fire nation flags, along with the prison, which blocks the main hallway to the entrance hatch.

The deck is made of two removable parts, and the tower is removable as well, and opens to become a playset. Behind this is the second smokestack, which can be removed to reveal a smaller boat, which is well-constructed. I should also mention that the ship is dark grey, and not grey like the box art suggests, making the set more true to the show.

The mini-figures in this set are very good. Aang the avatar, with his staff, is very well done, and Katara is a good mini-figure too, although her clothing color should be switched with Sokkaâ€™s. The fire bender and soldier are very well done too, and their parts would be well used in many themes. Zuko, though, is my favourite figure in this set. He features dark red armor instead of brown armor like the other bender, and he features a ponytail on the back of his head which is a nice touch.

I have to say this set is WELL worth the price, and the parts, features, and mini-figures are a pleasure to have. I would recommend this set above many sets released this year, and for its price range, it would be foolish to buy something else (besides 7707).

"A_Brickset_user","2006-12-27T13:18:21Z","detailed ship","It is a set worth purchasing.  There are a lot of minifigs, armor and features.  A few of the neat features are the catapult, the jail, and the front door, which is securely postioned. This set also includes a mini-ship which is stored neatly in a large,rear garage.  A downside to the ship would be that you have to take off the command tower and alot of the floor to get to the inside.  Becareful not to tilt the ship more than 40 degrees to the side, or the command tower will fall off.  The instructions were hard to follow and it took me an hour and a half to build.  The ship weighs about 3 pounds and is about 1 and a half feet long.  Its highest point is about a foot and a quarter tall. Overall, the ship was worth the time and effort. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Navalis","2007-10-06T23:28:16.747Z","Happy I waited!","I made the drive to Toys R Us this evening with Star Wars in mind and came away with two of these instead. This set was half price and there happened to be just two on the shelf.
I like the fact the ship is built out of bricks as previously pointed out. It's like Lego got back to their roots. I really like the red helmets in the Avatar sets. I will be using them on my knights for sure. Overall it was a good buy at regular price. There's a lot of pieces here to put to good use elsewhere.

If you are at Toys R Us anytime soon look for this set at 1/2 price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Hobie819","2008-01-18T14:12:11.64Z","Great price for the set","<p>
	I also got this set for 50% off. Even without the 50% off the set is worth it just for the peices. I&#39;m not a huge fan of Avatar and most of my sets are City/town, but the ship itself is easily converted into a modern day naval ship (As an example, I bought tbe batman dragster model also for half off, took the chain gun from the front and missle launcher from the back and added both of those to the ship).<br />
	<br />
	Modified (or unmodifed) it looks great in a city setting.<br />
	<br />
	Great set, good price. If you still see it on sale and are on the borderline of buying it, go for it.</p>

"wipefeetnmat","2012-01-05T11:35:56.48Z","Better than four...","&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe they only created two avatar sets, it was probably because they thought this set was good enough for at least four sets, if that is what they thought then they were right! This set is amazing! I converted it into a modern war ship by mounting a turret gun on it and remodeling the bridge. It comes with tons of guys so you can have a pretty good staged battle if you have two of them. Overall an amazing set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
