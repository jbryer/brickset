"greg_duncan","2006-07-21T23:16:51Z","a welcome line to the Lego family!","The southern air temple is a great set, and I am sure fans of the show will appreciate it more. Now, the temple is way off scale, but sticks with the overall style of the show and includes great features like the locking gate (which the instructions give no help on how to operate.), and the multiple shooting things. The fire nation tank is pretty cool, and features a disk launcher used more prominently used in the exo-force sets. 

The set features 4 great mini-figures; Aang, Sokka, and two fire nation soldiers, one being a masked firebender which is awesome. The other fire bender looks a little like sensei keiken from exo-force if you ask me. It also features Momo, the flying lemur which is a great part. The only downside to this set is the stickers, although the amount isn’t good enough to take a mark down. I must say this set deserves a 4.5, but I’ll round down to 4.

"LEGOmyeggo","2008-07-16T16:56:56.78Z","Great memorable set. ","This is one of my favorite sets out of the 274 that I currently own, and here is why:
-It includes a lifelike model of Aang's air temple as depicted on the television series. 
-There is a trapdoor on the upper level of the temple where you can drop the Fire Nation soldiers to their deaths.
-It includes the Fire Nation soldier and Firebender that attack the temple in a miniature tank that works quite well. 
-Momo, Aang, Sokka, the Firebender, and the Fire Nation soldier are all very well detailed.
-Aang's glider is nifty, as it does not break too easily. 
-It is so detailed, you can even act the episode where Aang, Sokka, Katara, and Momo discover the civilization living inside the Northern Air Temple with the battle and all. Except--where is Katara??? This is overall great because it is one of the only two Avatar sets that the Lego Group planned to make, sadly! I wish there were more.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I got it a couple years ago, and I still play around with it today! I'm really sad they stopped making these Avatar sets! The good old days...<div>&nbsp;</div><div>The only bad thing is that I wish it could have came with one more fire bender since they are like always together rather than a Fire-Nation Soldier. But besides that, this set is superb! This set gets 5 Bricks!!</div>",FALSE,5,5,5,5,4
