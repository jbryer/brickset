With your finger switch it - and the train goes to another city!

I think it is useful to make a way to a factory or a port.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Parts</h4><p>Basically this set is all about the parts. Switch rails add an extra dimension to any model train, and these are no exception. The switch mechanism is simple and effective. Lego &nbsp;has built in an additional feature, lacking in most model train switches; the switch will automatically move when under pressure from a train coming in from the ""wrong"" side. This feature prevents any derailments, and makes Lego trains a tad more user friendly then other systems.</p><p>Also the pins connecting the rails together for packaging have some use as parts, although they seem to be made of a plastic softer than normal Lego bricks.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>While not spectacular on their own, switch rails are a fun expansion to any train layout, Lego's switch rails get the job done right. The only downside is that it costs $16 USD to get what is at best an eight part set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,3,1
"CamberbrickGreen","2019-03-19T19:44:13.457Z","Branch Lines","<p>The Lego track system is a well made and user friendly railway that allows a huge play experience with technical and mechanical elements. This one is mechanical and a very handy piece for extended or more complex railway layouts.<br />
<br />
The set is pretty simple as an accessory set but totally worthwhile. You can see clearly there are two points sets and four very&nbsp;mild short curves. The simple mechanism for the points works really well and is a joy for a young railway worker. In bright yellow, they stand out well with a side to side motion.</p>

<p>I am not a fan of the solid rail sections but the points have to be solid really for functionality. I like these Lego one-piece mechanics for the Train theme which always feels like something special. The curves are too short for my liking but the gentle curve is a good design, it remains something of a disappointment that you can not construct these nowadays but I can go look for the old stuff, these are for my kids and will no doubt please them. As an accessory you can not build I would make a complaint about the price but then for the cost of making them, I wonder how many units they shift. Either way expect to fork out some cash when it comes to the entire theme.</p>

<p><strong>Junction Function</strong><br />
These pieces enable great play and hours of fun and are as much a tool in this way. Just a smidgen of build value with poorer value for money, they still have a weight and are a necessity and well, the sleepers could be plated over if you want brown or black instead? THe fact branch lines and sidings can grow from these is a real win and despite my misgivings over price, go compare these with other model railways that you can not construct, dear god, the money involved! At least the Lego rails remain a solid and reliable toy railway and I look forward to any expansion in to this amazing theme.</p>

"Guilherme_Lopes","2017-09-07T15:59:50.717Z","Lack of Curves","<p>We all that are fans of Lego trains want to have a few extra tracks on our layout. I bought this set last year at the same time as I bought the winter train and other Christmas gifts for last year.</p>

<p>Obviously I made my research and was sure of what I was getting with this set but now I feel it&#39;s short. Now I need more curvy tracks and I can&#39;t have them without buying some switches too. Or I&#39;ll have to buy another train and well... money does not grow on trees. I wonder if Lego will ever have track sets as they did in the 80&#39;s where you would buy just one time of it. I just need curves... and actually a few straights too... why do I have to pay for switches and flexible tracks when I don&#39;t need them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hopefully Lego will know better and we will have more curves and straights again.</p>
