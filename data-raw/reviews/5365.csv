"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-02T00:02:07.827Z","Straight and Curved Rails","This was a really good set at the time. Once upon a time I had lots more money than usual. My mother told me it would be a nice touch with a train in my city. I agreed, but was unsure of my decision. (I hadn't discovered Brickset then and didn't know if it were a good buy or not). Anyway, it was on sale at 20% off and when it is a large sum of money it is usually a large sum taken as a percentage. Anyway, I faced the truth, my city was looking a little bare at the time, and I thought that a train would make thing better. So, that was the story of how I bought my electric train. 

I was releaved to see the train came with tracks, or else it wouldn't work so well. I built my train. I built my tracks. there was a nice oval shape going on there. It was perfect for my city. I liked it. I enjoyed watching it go round. 
Then one day, in a supermarket of some sort, I bought this set along with the multi-connection rails. What a buy! Too bad it didn't fit in my city. 

It was at this time that my city went through the dark ages, everything was scattered here and there, a total mess waiting for a lot of well-needed renovation. It was because I was waiting on more baseplates from my mother. Just enough, the idea was, for the train tracks to sit on. 

Then, late one night, they came! So I willingly helped with the groceries waiting for a chance to use the baseplates combined! - Only to be put to bed. I woke up in the morning and assembled everything. It didn't work. I tried doing it a different way. the main problem was that there was not enough straight rails. I then cunningly joined together some curvy rails to make a straight out of. It worked this time, with a couple of curvies left over.

So, once I had created the master track, I refurbished the city, and made some buildings. I then watched the train go around and around the track and it was quite fun. The only thing I would have changed in this set would be to include an ascending and descending ramp on it. This way the train can go high, and I would definately play with it a lot more.  

The track I made was originally designed for there to sit a train station, but that never got created. The switching rails I broke somehow but it was still okay. The city I once refurbished, has gone into complete madness again and since I got into star wars it had got invaded by sci-fi. The buildings are pretty much intact, but are multi-storied now. The real trick, I found when I reincarnated the city, was trying to miss the buildings with the train, and it is often fun to see a close shave or an actual collision. 

These tracks are good, overall, I think, and will help you if you have an electric train or not. Also, it would go fantastically with pillars, if you have lots of them and a train, you should buy this set, because it is hard to stick them flat on the baseplate sometimes. I know there are train fans out there, and this set would go good with your collection of trains, especially if you have two electric trains. That means you can pick up enough speed to colide with each other. That would be so cool. You can also make an obstacle course for the train, I remember on one of my birthdays it was fun because my friends tied a grappling hook on the back and made it knock over targets that were beside it. They also set up minifigures on the track like a western movie, the train powering up it's nine vault engine. 

This set is garanteed to give you extra fun, and if you like the electric train you have now then you need this set. You will like it, and best of all it is ideally not at a bad price either, once you know what you have got.

It holds all standard trains 9v and so on (of course 9v won't run without electrical power). Perfect for all RC trains and for displaying your trains that don't have motors or your custom train creations. The biggest problem with the set is people don't want 8 curved rails. Most people, like myself, bought boxes of 9v straight track in bulk years ago when they made it. Lego needs to reconsider packaging these in different boxes and selling separate boxes of 8 and 8 rails. Most people only want straight track and many are unwilling to take on 8 curved rails when they buy the straight rails. Package them separate and I would buy them buy the truckload. Now they just become a lot of wasted pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Nikola_Bathory","2012-02-27T04:01:43.707Z","An essential set","This set is essential for train fans, mainly because of the straight rails. The flexi rails do have their uses, but the normal straight ones are better when you simlpy need a straight line.<br>The curved rails included here aren't really needed, I wish there were separate sets with straight and curved rails, that would be much better. Now I have more curved rails than I need.<br>In any case, if you're a fan of LEGO trains, you will need this set.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
