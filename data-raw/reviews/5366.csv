"Lola","2008-01-15T03:47:54.043Z","Rather disappointing, unfairly expensive set","I must say I unlickily live in an area where I can't just grab the Spring Clearance Sale or whatever; hence I paid $200 for the thing to offer to my 11-year-old one.

Fun and quick to build, the parts are compatible with your average Technic bricks; there's actually quite not many parts in the set but there is still some free room to play around and invent some alternative models - The Lego Spirit is there.

As a toy though, it's far from great; It's indeed very tough (but for the steering arms see below) but lack of progressive steering/progressive speed makes driving it hard to learn, hard to use with any level of precision. 

Ever tried to drive something with an On/Off gas pedal and, worse, a FullLeft/0/FullRight steering? Since it is actually a fast machine, it kills the pleasure; you can't aim for a jump, you can't keep turning tight around corners 'cause all you can do is Full-Stop-Left-Right.

And it doesn't steer right, a fact that's not helped by the fact that the steering control arm are tiny Racers arms that flex (and stay bent) at first shock (there is no wa&amp;y you can build a convenient front bumper alas). Out of the bow anyway it wasn't right anyway...

It's truly a huge disappointment in that price range, given the usual quality of LEGO toys; that one was build on the cheap side while selling on the expensive one: unfair at best, since otherwise design, buildup, strength &amp; all are very fine.

"Tanager","2008-03-05T14:48:46.64Z","Not much for building, great fun if you have an open space to play","I think the key to this set is expectations.  I bought it at a steep discount and only b/c I wanted something big, fast, and durable that I can blast around my office in.  We have a large open area of concrete subfloor which hasn't yet been turned into a cubicle farm, and my office site has lots of piney woods and lawn which all make for great places to race this thing.

The comments about precision are accurate - I'd hate to try and navigate a tight slalom course with it.  But I'm not really that knowledgeable about RC cars in general - I wanted a toy, not a serious hobbyist's model or the like.  This thing qualifies.  I've taken it down concrete stairs (and attempted to climb the same, and the thing *almost* had the torque to do it), over curbs, and into various walls (the last mostly unintentionally - it *is* hard to control at speed).

But for just pure zany fun, if you can find this set cheap, it's worth it.  Just be careful about what you expect out of it (I've definitely gotten better than 15-25 minutes of battery life, but I haven't tried to run it totally down, either - I'd hope for more than that).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jamal_lts","2009-08-14T18:59:22.2Z","in hopes of...","i got this set in the hopes of using the RC function into my larger technic models.. but sadly, the wheels don't fit at the back.. U can however dismantle the front wheels and fit in your larger technic wheels. Tried it on the Extreme Offroader wheels and it fits.

Other lego pieces can't fit into this model hence u can create other models using this set.

But in the end, i am happy with this set... i had it run through all posible terrain except snow... and my my... how well it traverse through muddy and rocky conditions!
