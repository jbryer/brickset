I was pumped to get a bunch of minifigs but couldn't believe there were only 3 females in the set. The set is pretty useful when building up the citizen count for your town. The 3 wheelers are a nice bonus as are the bikes. Tons of minifig accessories are included to add touches of realism throughout your town. As another reviewer stated, it is hard to believe that every single figure had the same head. Don't we have enough of this head already? For the price, LEGO should really include other head styles. This is an easy way to build your population but it will be a group of people who have the same face! Obviously if you love minifigs this set is for you!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Over all it it worth buying because its the only set that comes with so many minifigures.The only con is that they all have the same face, but what set is exactly perfect???",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Build - 9/10. It's building loads of Minifigs... what's not fun about that?! Especially  when you don't own most of them already!

Minifigs - 10/10. Obviously! 31 Minifigs? A world record I think for most Minifigs ever in a set! It comes with four Policemen, one robber (Whose riding a motorcycle with a Dustbin on it?), a chef, a waiter, a skateboarder, four firemen, three standard bicyclists, one skateboarder, two Octan mechanics, two Octan workers, two nurses, one Doctor, a female swimmer, some guy with a walkie-talkie and a suit, another mechanic of some sorts, and four repairmen.

Playability - 8/10. Well... there's no buildings or *Big* vehicles, so to speak. However the Minifigs, dogs, and accessories does offer quite a lot playability. So, I think it does deserve an 8/10.

Versatility - 9/10. Extremely easy to swop around parts and make other Minifigs! The only slight problem being that all of them just have standard smiley heads.

Overall - 9/10. Very cool, and great for adding to your town's population! I highly advise this to anyone, as it offers great fun. 


I hope you enjoyed my review and found it useful!

This set provides 31&nbsp;unique mini figures with different clothes, tools, and vehicles. The only tt thing is if you want something to build there is not much here and the price is a little high. Overall I certainly recommend this set.</p>
