<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent parts assortment, including some hard-to-find elements such as metal crane hooks, gear blocks, weights, spools, and clutch gears.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Excellent value when this set was offered. $59.99 in US for a set with over 1100 elements.The price was later raised to $79.99.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Includes plenty of generic Technic parts as well. Even though this set is supposed to be used in conjunction with other Technic sets such as RCX or motor packs, this set has plenty of play value on its own.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Comes with the pictured storage trays (2). </li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No instructions or ideas included for models or integration of this set into other Technic and Mindstorms sets.</li></ul><ul><li>Does not include a ""real"" box. Mine came in a brown cardboard box. It would have been nice to have things packed in a plastic tub like other Dacta sets.</li></ul><ul><li>Parts colors varied based on availability. This isn't really a negative, but it is a curious aspect of Dacta sets. On a resource set like this one, the type and quantity of elements were specified, but the colors could vary.<br></li></ul><ul><li>No motorized elements included. This would have added even more play value. However, the Dacta line did include other resource sets with motors that were contemporaries of this set. These sets were generally quite a bit more expensive.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, an excellent source of Technic parts and a must-have for a true Technic fan. While this set was offered, it was an excellent value. It was only available through LEGO Education and not the usual retail sources.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
