                     Pros:
                   KANOHI VAHI
                   Vahi disk
           lots of access weapons and pieces

                     Cons:
         only 5 vahkii and no black rahkshi head
             Stupid looking disk of time

I thought: &quot;for $20 and 300 peices (especially BIONICLE peices) this is a deal regardless of its contents, so, let's see what's inside...&quot;

I had no Idea that I would get so many parts plus 4/6 vahki, 2 masks of time (don't ask why) and two surprisingly unspectacular disks of time which are actually faithful to the story since the mask was forged from a disk of the six infused elements.

If you somehow find this still sealed and at a decent price, buy it, without hesitation, if you are a fan, collector, or a kid who needs more parts, buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-26T14:01:20.403Z","Not the best part set, but good.","Well, 300 isn't actually alot in this set. There were very few axels and pins so you can't build much. But you do get alot of weaponry like Toa Metru, Vahki, etc. This would mainly be an addition to an already existing part collection. Either way, a great source of tools for MOCists or people who somehow manage to lose or break weapons.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
