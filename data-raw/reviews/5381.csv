"Joely","2006-07-18T15:37:04Z","Great Another Combinar Set!","I Brought this set thinking it looked really cool because of the way they posed him on the box, but when I made it it was rubbish

Pros:
Golden Spine
Lots of Places to put Zamor Spheres
Light-Up Eyes x3
Glow in the Dark Teeth x3

Cons:
Very wobbly hand
Too Longer Neck
Zamors Loosly Fitted
Legs to big to pose
Another Combinar Model 

It would be better if they made it with its own parts instead of using 3 of the Pirakas (Vezok, Thok and Reidak) because its a nice Idea. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It does not look like the picture on the box so do not tricked by the that picture. Now I am thinking about giving it to my niece may be he will like it. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-26T17:30:08.687Z","Cool combination","This set is a combination of three piraka, using a gold spine. This set also includes 21 zamor spheres, and the piraka's light-up eyes. The teeth can glow in the dark. But he don't have the double-sided piraka weapons, and the cost is expensive. Is more cheap buy the three piraka that made this set, but they don't have a gold spine, and 21 spheres. But they have some features too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T13:00:01.5Z","A weird set!","I got this set for Christmas in 2006.  It was really cool!  I liked the spikes, the weapons, and everything!  I made it into the Piraka instead of keeping it as Irnakk.  He is a really cool, and really weird, set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"reidak12","2011-12-13T08:19:36.663Z","Very Intimidating","<p>I got this set in 07 after the Piraka had been retired. I first built the three of them, but then I thought, when would I ever get this again? I built Irnakk instead. I really like the gold spine, even though it is exactly the same as Thok's, and mine got slightly deformed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>Gold pieces</p>
<p>lot of zamors</p>
<p>places to put them</p>
<p>has instructions for Piraka</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>construction of legs makes for poor posability</p>
<p>no weapons, except for launcher</p>
<p>my spine was deformed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ask me, Irnakk is not a great model, but back when this was available, it was definitely worth the money for the three Piraka.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,4
