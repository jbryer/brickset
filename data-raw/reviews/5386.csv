"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-18T18:40:25.14Z","Nice Set","I got this free with the lego magazine and I like it! I think that exoforce needs really cheap sets like this.

pros:
hikaru
free with lego mag
looks like gate guardian
guns

cons:
legs and wings tend to flop downwards
how can a minifig like hikaru hold up such big wings??
how do you stand on to pairs of legs flying and running?
in other words, not particularly realistic...

still, quite nice.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
