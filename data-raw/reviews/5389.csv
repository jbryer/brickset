"tkettle9719","2011-12-28T00:30:45.197Z","Hummer: Lego Edition","<p>This is among one of the nine sets fearured in the Mr. Magorium Creator value pack. It is a very well made product, and comes at a great price in the combo pack.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-This set is in the right color- black; it just feels right.<br></li><li>-The car is instantly recognizable as a Hummer, a quite well made one too. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The red bricks feel as though they are in the wrong place, are somewhat awkward.<br></li><li>-A license plate over the hinge bar in the front would be a really nice add-on. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a classic example of what all Lego sets should be like- simple, elegant, and similar to real life. This is a great small set that I would recommend to any Lego fan.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,5
