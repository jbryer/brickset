They only use one brick for the eyes, however. I just think that's a little silly, and you can't move the legs, either. This, I would recommend it, for $2.99.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-23T14:07:24.293Z","Triceratops","I got this today with the Daily Mirror. I don't like it very much because it's horns are too far up, there's bricks under it which make it look weird, the tail and head are unrealistic.

Pros:
Stands up well
Good Colour Scheme
Moveable head/headplate

Cons:
Legs don't move
Bricks under body make it look stupid
Tail/head unrealistic

Overall, 3/5",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Pros:
stands up well
good colour scheme
good for a promo
easy to build
yo can rebuild it into a moth(that's what it looks like)

Cons:
small instructions,could get lost
legs can't move

very good for a promo 5/5

The triceratops is kinda ok - for a small model, it stands out quite well. The only downside is the tail - should be longer.

Other than that, a good selection of bricks",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The black tail is a bit uncreative, as is the transparent green piece, no thought process<br></li><li>-The model is very hard to decipher as to what it is. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>I don't have anything against this model, but it has some flaws that are hard to excuse. Buy it at a low price, or not at all.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,5
