I'm quite pleased with it, it's a good ornament, but it doesn't have very good playability. However, since I got it for free I'm not going to complain and I give it 4/5!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Useful green hinges - for making sectioned gardens for houses (can you tell my oldest is a girl).  Slightly too big for a bellville princess to kiss, but thats only my opinion apparently!

5* rare 1*1*2/3 dark green slopes.  But I am not sure what else these can be used on yet.

and you get a few spare pieces left over.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The green pieces are great for any collector, and add some detail to the set. <br></li><li>-I just love the overlarge eyes; adorable.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The eyes are strange since they don't move, and they aren't in the front. <br></li><li>-The back leg is minor, but I don't like the reverse.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is adorable and cheap. I'd buy one off eBay right now if I didn't have one. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
