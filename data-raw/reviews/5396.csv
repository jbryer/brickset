You get a cool little nic-nac that's easy to build and blades that spin. Also includes cool clear pieces. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The propeller works with amazing ease.&nbsp; <br></li><li>-The hole is worthless on one side of the set, but I fixed this problem by putting a Lego camera in it to make it a paparazzi chopper; either way, it attacks.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The back propeller was a miss since it's just there. <br></li><li>-The choice of the side-studded brick on the side is confusing. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is really a fine example of what all Lego sets should be like. I also like the simple and classic color scheme that this set has got going on. Buy this fine mini model.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
