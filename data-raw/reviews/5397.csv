	This is one of the sets included in the Mr. Magorium Creator set, and is my least favorite model, though I still find it to be a nice mini model.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		There is actually a space for a minifigure, and it looks just right. I currently have injured dying Anakin in the boat.</li>
	<li>
		The boat is very simple in design, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t good.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The back pieces don&#39;t really need to be there.</li>
	<li>
		The boat would be a bit better if it were larger.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set&#39;s color scheme also contributes to a great set, which should be bought at a really low price.</p>
