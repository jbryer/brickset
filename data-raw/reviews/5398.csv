Great things-
-Four really cool mini figures including nice, detailed heads
-Nice flexible &quot;goal nets&quot;
-Interesting stickers portraying mini figures playing soccer
-Fun playabilty
-Cool way to have goal keepers shoot and block
-Nice &quot;city field&quot; look
-Large for a twenty dollar set

Dislikes-
-Stickers on the mini figures torsos
-Hard to play two on two (but easy to use)

Overall this is a great soccer set for those who want a soccer set either for fun, or just to complete a collection.  I was not disappointed with the looks either. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Flex","2008-11-14T15:16:01.717Z","There are better soccer sets","I saw this set on sale for $14.99 so I thought I might as well pick it up. I actually liked the the set less then I thought I would.  

Pros: There are some good pieces, like a lot of black fences and plates.

Cons: There is only two plyers on each team- older soccer feilds had at least three. Also, the new goals are horrible- the old nets wree way better.

-Overall: I wouldn't buy this unless you really like soccer sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"I_like_Lego","2009-07-04T20:28:32.763Z","Cheap and good","My dad bought this set for me for 3.00 CAN but the box had large holes in it that's why it was cheap,when i got home to build it i walked to go get something and when i came back my cat was playing with the one of the socerball's,this set came with no stickers.

</h4><h4>The Good:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A decent supply of parts, black fence pieces, net pieces, and more.
