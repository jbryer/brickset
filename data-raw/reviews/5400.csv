"shenron","2007-12-27T08:28:54.31Z","Brilliantly simple design","This set is from the pre-Legoland era, when the early minifigures all looked like little faceless Charlot.

The main model is a water-landing airplane with propeller blades on front, and an added tiny speedboat. The design of both is really simple, but it does showcase very effectively how even the simplest Lego bricks can achieve effective results. 

The &quot;roundness&quot; of the plane section is rendered by using slope and inverted slope bricks. The wings are two basic 16x6 plates. The resulting model may look a bit blunt, but definitely sturdy and attractive.

The tiny speedboat is built with just 15 pieces but is a lovely addition.

The simplicity of the pieces means high building value, although the suggested alternative models leave a lot to be desired. Some of the included pieces are not at all easy to find, such as the concave blue slopes and the doors.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rlmester","2010-03-09T22:23:52.53Z","A simple but effective design!!","This is one of the first sets I owned.&nbsp; My brother and I both got the same set.&nbsp; I just recently yanked the pieces out from my tub of bulk pieces and reconstructed this set.&nbsp; Boy did it bring back the memories. I loved how the use of the inverted slopes combined with bricks and regular slopes formed a round airplane body.&nbsp; It felt great in the hands.&nbsp; With this plane I went on many a great adventure!<br><br>The versatility of these old sets with their basic bricks is wonderful.&nbsp; You had to be more abstract with you imagination, but what couldn't you build?&nbsp; <br><br>",FALSE,4,3,5,4,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me it sums up what Lego is all about.</p>
<p>Straightforward bricks used in a really clever way to create a solid sea plane and little supporting speed boat that offers loads of imaginative play value.</p>
<p>Fusalage of the plane is made up of sloped bricks, and as another review pointed out, this model feels really well-balanced and sturdy.</p>
<p>If you have a good selection of traditional bricks, - and a couple of large plates for the wings -&nbsp;why not download the instructions&nbsp;and have a go at putting this one together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy building!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"yellowsubmarine","2020-12-13T19:14:29.22Z","Simple design, today a creator set","<p>This set was given to me as a present way back in the 1980&#39;s. The simple yet so flawless design is still up to date. Absolutely fantastic is the usage of&nbsp;slopes and&nbsp;inverted slopes to build a sturdy playable set. The body of the plane is great. The wings are large. Additionally i had to fix the wings to keep them from falling off when playing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boat is a nice add-on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the cabin and the boat there is enough space for mini figures from today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could have been a creator set of the 2010&#39;s.</p>
