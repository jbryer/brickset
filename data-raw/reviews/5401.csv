The set has a spoiler and fender, as well as a cockpit, with alternate color to represent a seat. There is a windshield and a large detailed engine, with the rare solid stud cylinders. The engine is probably the coolest feature. This set is just plain simple and just plain cool. Now it is overly expensive due to its rarity, but the set is not lacking.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I never had the option of the larger technic sets, so this one allowed a glimpse into the technic world without the larger sets.  I am really happy to see the technic sets of 2009 go back to smaller sets that can open up the world of technic without costing too much.
