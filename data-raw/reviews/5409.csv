"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-24T23:44:10Z","Good for gifts","This set is great for gifts (like how I received it), with three prominent minifig-magnets that work great as play figures too. The magnets are surprisingly strong, so you can stick them on the fridge door. Everything can be separated as per normal (unlike in keychains) except for the magnet legs. A pity, but excellent anyway!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Mexell","2007-05-21T01:57:21.96Z","Feel the Force","These magnets do have a 'force'ful attraction to metal.  There is a magnet in each leg and one inside the torso (which is probably why the legs are glued on).  Except for these two pieces, the minifigs come apart.  Make up your own character magnets!  Fully assembled they can connect to bricks just like a normal figure.  Sets of 3 magnet figures range from $14.99-9.99 USD which makes each character kinda pricey.  If the price was lower this set would score a 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
