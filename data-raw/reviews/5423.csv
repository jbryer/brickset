 Chewie is made of two parts since the legs and torso are connected by the magnet.Chewie's head seems to have no eyes and a ammo belt.
 Obi-Wan has the head from ultimate space battle set and for some reason has peach legs and not the legs that he had in General greivous chase.
 Darth Vader has a chrome lightsaber(like Obi) and has a realistic burned,gray face.
 A thing I noticed was that lego S@H magazine and lego.com had different prices.The magazine had 9.99 USD and the website had 12.99 USD and when discounted to 9.98,most people saved a cent compared to the magazine price. 
The magnets are fun to play with but Chewie somtimes turns upside down because of his head.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
