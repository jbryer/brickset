"Mr_Dunlop","2007-12-16T06:23:06.187Z","Cool.","I got mine at Legoland, California in September/October '06, and lost one of the six balls since then. In all, it's a cool &quot;set&quot;, worth buying just for how fun it is, even if you are not a Bionicle fan. It only gets a 3, since it's not Lego, but it is fun.

This is a pretty powerful toy, for a foam ball shooter. It can and does hurt, so aim it away from your face! (Please, I know from personal experiences)
