It reminds me of the custom vans back in the 1970's. The boat looks alot like a yacht which is ultra cool. This is an excellent set to have!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Imagine my surprise when I saw a boxed, original set come for sale on eBay, no bids just Buy It Now for £10!   Needless to say it is a welcome addition to the boats / marine lines in my collection.   I have learnt since I got the set that this was a U.S only set and the three sets which make up set 1721 were available separately at some stage.   The set is divided into three unique parts which together create ‘Sandypoint Marina’.   I think ‘marina’ is a little grandesque!   Especially when you compare it to the Sail ‘N’ Fly Marina!   Having said that, I love this set and think it’s very charming and I am really pleased I have finally got it; my wish list is getting smaller now, especially with these ‘older’ sets.   As mentioned, this set is divided into three sections:

The mooring pontoon and fisherman is basic but does the job, the mooring pontoons are provided in grey and stand on grey supports which would be secured to the shore underwater.   There is also a red handrail for safety as well as a red mooring post for any boats wishing to moor up.   The fisherman comes complete with stubble, sunglasses, blue baseball cap and life vest, just what he needs considering the size of the shark he is about to reel in!   The shark is the traditional issue two-piece set with movable jaw.   The fishing rod features the flexible rod, line and reel, and of course the bait attached to the end of the line.

The jeep and windsurfer works so well together, the surfer comes in his summer clothes also with life vest and brown hair.   The windsurfing board is bright red and features a white two-piece mast and boom assembly with white sail which is detailed with blue and red stripes.   There is also a transparent section for navigation purposes.   The jeep is presented in a clean white colour with blue stripe down the side and palm tree graphic on the rear quarter.   The jeep also features a grill with lights, yellow wheels and off-road tyres, perfect for the beach.   The cab features opening doors and a tilting roof panel allowing access to the inside.   Placed on top of the jeep are two yellow clips, these are provided to hold the two parts of the windsurf mast in place while the vehicle is moving.   The surfboard can also be stored adjacent to this area.   The sail can be rolled up, secured and slid into the jeep through the rear tailgate.

The cabin cruiser is reminiscent of the many craft which cruise the rivers of Norfolk in the UK, in particular the hire cruisers of many fleets.   The boat has a red waterline band, clean white hull with blue graphics and a red deck with forepeak vent.   The transom slopes gradually while a ‘cut-out’ allows access to the water, perhaps for swimming or boarding purposes.   The cabin has small blue portlights and an opening hatch allowing access to this area.   On either side of the cabin are navigation lights (port and starboard) which are mounted on colour coordinated brackets which protrude from the sides of the boat.   Slightly aft of these is the semi-flying bridge which features steering wheel, sports-style windshield and room for the supplied minifig.   Abaft of this area is a high radar arch mounted on white fins.   This features a rear-facing adjustable searchlight and burgee mast with running lights; two small VHF antennae are also fitted to the gantry.

Overall an excellent set and one I feel lucky to finally have in my collection, perhaps it’s not much of a marina, more of a cove, but let your imagination run wild and make it a marina!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sandypoint Marina Value Pack is one of the better bargains for your money, instead of offering up a bunch of small models like some of the value packs this one gave you a small, medium and large model to build. There was the Pleasure Cruiser, the Windsurfer &amp; Van and the Shark Fisherman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO gave us Value Packs and unique models with those self same value packs in order to give those of us without too much money to have some really fun sets to build and play with. The Value Packs of our more modern Themes tend to still be good dollar value, but instead of unique models you basically get just the regular sets on the shelf in a larger boxed package. I think I prefer these older Value Packs to the newer ones and wouldn't mind if LEGO went back to this style of Value Packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have already recommended the sets in their individual reviews I don't think I need to go and do it again, but why not? If you can get this value pack even in open individual set form you definitely should try to.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
