The 4x4 may be small, but it has plenty of tools and does not lack detail, but the snow plow is the gem for space fans. The small Ice Planet 2002 set has some great parts and is a very practical set. The small plow hs both the ice planet logo slope and the control panel slope, as well as the rare radar dish. What makes the set an even bigger mystery is that neither of the two items have names, but if you manage to find the actual name, please e-mail me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
