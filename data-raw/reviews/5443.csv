<p>Pros</p>

<p>-Large amount of pieces for a low price</p>

<p>-Easy,simple builds.</p>

<p>- This set gives you a lot of standard Lego bricks, which is welcome to any collection</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>-The builds are vey simplistic, but given the recommended age you&#39;d expect that.</p>

<p>- Thinner plates would have been easier to use instead of thick ones</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a great set for all ages, much better than any (if not all) the Lego Classic sets that have been released recently.</p>
