Yes this is a magnet set, but unlike the newer sets that the figures stand on a magnet, this one the magnets are in the figures.  Do not worry you can still use them like regular mini-figures.  The one good thing about this set is if you do not have any of the figures this makes up for it.  I just hapen to have another Robin that I got in another set, so that makes this set even better for me since I do not have another Catwoman and Joker figure.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
