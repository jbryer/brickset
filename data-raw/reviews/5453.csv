There are really very few pieces in there! Even though they said there are 35% more bricks on the cover, the total bricks are only about 30 pieces. There is also a chassis piece and they had different color schemes than previous Duplo vehicle chassis piece. This set like any Duplo set appeals more to toddlers and the bright tub can encourage them to clean up after each play session as well as babies love bright colors.
