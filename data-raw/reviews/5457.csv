"gusmoore","2007-02-27T12:16:32.717Z","Best Castle since the original one!!","One thing was making it up with the amount of pieces I own in my own collection, but other it's to have it, now that I last have it, it's an excellent set, it worths every penny you spend on this. The minifigs are great, even there's almost nothing printed on them and the shields are actually stickers, but you can forget this TLC's mistake by seeing how things work out. There are lots of traps and the bests things of it are the torture chamber, the blacksmith's basement workshop and the wizard's liar. The colors, awesome, there's no compare! The structure itself it's quite simple and impressive, lots of ye olde walls and the traditional lion-head pieces. Lovely, just lovely!! Regards from Mexico.

"mrmitch","2007-07-01T23:52:19.623Z","The King has a home - Castle to be exact.","This past week I got the Royal Knight's Castle. It is a great set, has 10 mini figures two horses and lots of really cool features. It took quite awhile to build due to the # of bricks and detailed  instructions (2 books). The set was great fun to build !! We love the little extra touches such as the skelton chained to the wall, blacksmiths work area and the dungeon. Excellent set, I recommend it highly  AWESOME CASTLE !!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"deluckybrick","2007-12-26T10:05:40.86Z","Best castle ever.","I just got this set for Christmas, and it took my 3 hours to build, but it was worth it.  The level of detail is amazing... (from the top down)

Bats in the belfry
Dropping rocks trap
Two working catapults
Evil wizard's lair with two goblets

"sudorum","2008-02-22T18:22:48.967Z","the ye olde glory days are back, laddies","This is a remake of another lego castle, much older, and i must say this is one great lego. Great figs, and the castle itself is great too, with the typical yet classic chain mechanism which drops rocks. It is detailed and o' so satisfying. The top of the castle dettaches from the base platform to reveal a basement with a blacksmith shop and a torture rack with a skeleton on it. It has a merlin minifigure, and it has room for improvising on the interior as well. You will buy it if you admire the olden glory days of lego castles.",FALSE,5,4,5,4,4
"norco_kid","2008-03-15T22:33:06.81Z","Get one while you can..","This set left such an impression on me that I felt I hat to review it.

Pros
- LOTS of minifigs (12)
- A HUGE amount of weapons/shields/helmets/body armor
- Lots of nice castle pieces (printed walls, lion statues, pillars)
- Looks amazing when completed
- Very fun build
- Inexpensive (paid $60)

Cons
- Stickers (flags and shields)
- Non-Printed torsos/legs
- Ghost's hands are yellow?

I am really really pleased with this set. Get it for sure if you like castles, want to build an army or just want a really great assortment of parts.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legoragon","2009-03-23T21:40:44.56Z","This is incredible, welcome back classic castle!","This set is amazing, it has a dungeon,a wizard tower, 4 towers, the base plate is awesome, and the ghost is a great addition.

The only bad thing is that the dwarf a) doesn't have a beard and b) he is different than the other current dwarves.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alex_Bunch","2009-05-13T12:52:09.763Z","The End of a golden age","For me this brought the final end to the series of sets before the millenium yet Lego did it very well indeed. This set has everthing you could probably want from a big castle set. It has a big baseplate, good design, horses, minifigs (the best for me was the wizard), accesories etc. Also the customisation possibilities are endless. Truly a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Hylocera","2010-01-30T16:30:43.233Z","Great castle, though not so many rooms","I found three of these left at Costco one day, at $69.99 each! I just HAD to get it the instant I saw it. Every cent was spent wisely, as my Pros/Cons review will soon show:

Pros
12 minifigures!
Lots of exclusive shields, armor, and weapons that I haven't seen since the Viking Assault Wagon or almost 10 years ago
Huge base
Glow in the dark ghost torso
Working magnifying glass
Two horses
Lots of red and blue banners, and an awesome grey one

Cons
The rock-dropping thing on the tower behind the one on the right doesn't work so well
The base is kinda...rocky
LEGO could've added a few rooms here and here

Other than the cons above, this set is Pros/Pros. 5/5 Shrimpmaker over and out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"birgoyle","2010-04-17T13:50:11.467Z","One of the Best!","Only just managed to pick one of these up.. Thanks ebay!<br><br>Have to say this is ~one~ of the best castles made. <br>As mentioned in all the reviews, it has an extensive modular design, the 4 tower sections can be positioned any way you like for maximum effect. <br><br>I really like the fact it's a complete castle, almost fully enclosed with nice architecture. The only architectural flaw is the big gap behind the king's throne, but this is understandable (it is meant to be played with!)<br><br>I had the original King Leo's castle, with a silly flag at the back, in place of proper walls. This remake is definitely an upgrade to the set, though very similar. <br><br>I love the 3d baseplates and think the disappearance of these in recent sets is a bad move by Lego. They were unnecessary in many sets, but it looks brilliant here, making the castle tall and intimidating to enemies. (perfect opportunity to connect to the path at the back, perhaps leading to a custom stable or living quarters!)<br><br><br>My only cons for this set are the minifigs - as mentioned before (didn't realise the extent from previous reviews) that NONE of the minifigs are printed - they are all plain torsos, no pattern or designs unless covered by the bland chest-plate armour. Only 3 minifigs have any pattern - the red knight, and the 2 bad guys have patterns on their chest-plates. <br><br>Unless you have some Knights Kingdom / King Leo minifigs up your sleeves to add to this castle then you may feel a bit ripped off. <br><br>And prepare to be patient applying the stickers to each flag and shield... <br><br><br>But other than these small negatives it's a brilliant set, and a MUST-HAVE for any Castle collector!<br>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"ClassicLegosAreBetter","2010-08-30T11:59:09.153Z","Actually a hybrid of 6090 and 6091","<p><strong>The Castle:</strong> When this set frist came out, Lego stated that it was just a re-release of the stupendous 6090 Royal Knight's castle with different pieces. Eventually they realized we were not buying that. If you ask me it looks more like 6091 King Leo's Castle, but actually it looks like a hybrid between the two, it is quite a handsome&nbsp;structure I will admit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Horses and Axe Wagon:</strong> It seems like it was an after-thought but still brings a level of playability to the castle if you don't have any other castle sets to battle with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong> The figures have the same logos as the Knight's Kingdom I guys but don't look at all alike. This was a problem when trying to play with this and the Knight's Kingdom I line. As stated before, it does look like the King Leo's Castle but the minifigures ruin it in my opinion. I solved this problem by putting the minifigures faces on matching Knight ""uniforms"" this way they looked like one army. Because the&nbsp;normal minifigures in this set do not match hardly at all.&nbsp;The king is all different kinds of&nbsp;colored up, the red knight is well... red, and the soldiers are straight&nbsp;grey. They do not look like&nbsp;a unified army at all. The classic castle&nbsp;sets were so good at doing this, a perfect&nbsp;example being the army of&nbsp;6090 Royal Knight's Castle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Overall:</strong> Nice design, good blend between&nbsp;6090 and 6091, but the minifigures ruin&nbsp;this set. I mean why does everyone have to have that big attachable knight armor, it looks good on full-fledged&nbsp;knights with horses.&nbsp;However on the average run-of-the-mill soldier,&nbsp;the big clunky&nbsp;armor&nbsp;is a bit much, does anyone agree? If you can modify the minifigures, or as another reviewer said before, put in Knight's Kingdom I minifigures, this could be an easy 8 or maybe a 10.(the way I modified mine it's an 8) However as it stands out of the box a 6 is all I can give it. Again, just my opinion.</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,4,4
