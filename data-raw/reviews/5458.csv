Fortunately we found this jewel of a set before we spent all of that time building a wooden one. (It would be neat to have a grandchild to play with this set... with us, but that is another story!)<div><br></div><div>This dollhouse is flat out adorable! One would have to be heartless to not fall in love with it. I remember seeing it on the shelves 7 years ago and thinking that it was overpriced. And I was not yet collecting DUPLO. By the time I got into DUPLO four years ago, it was hard to find; my four copies are used because new ones are so rare.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I did not receive instructions, but just used the photos on the damaged box to build the set, which is similar in structure to many of the DUPLO buildings. The walls and roof are solid when set up on the strong baseplates. These are well formed and fitted pieces that should hold up for decades if not exposed to outside elements, too much heat or sun, or destructive little siblings who chew on everything in sight. So if you have one of these chewers around, please keep them away from this set or give them something else to chew on. (Large rubber bands worked for Son One, who always has had something in his mouth...even as an adult.)</div><div><br></div><div>The pink color combo works quite well for the little ones. If you are anti-pink, hire a detective and find a copy of the similar blue Dacta playhouse (9225), but they are expensive and rare, and you can't have mine!</div><div><br></div><div>The DUPLO family is perfect fit for the house and medium blue car, which is my all time favorite LEGO vehicle...only 8 of these cars in my fleet. The kitchen, living and dining room are furnished with taste, and the landscaping is also a treat to rearrange. Add a few more plants and trees, and this set stands out even more.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Children (and some adults!) can play with this set for hours. I give this set the highest rating because of its outstanding design, colors, and ability to entertain a person for hours. I dearly hope that TLG will introduce more dollhouses in other colors....aqua, lavender, light green, light yellow, light orange, and other pastel colors. Kids of all ages deserve such fine products.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
