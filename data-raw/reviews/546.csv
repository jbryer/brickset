The little guard fortress, even though built in the water, was a great little defensive addition to any other soldier's set. It added a fortified dock so unloading those rowboats wasn't so dangerous anymore.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-11T22:52:43Z","Awesome sets!","yes! that's true! the chariot is cool, as the figure's legs are tri-colored(joint=red left leg=black right leg=blue). i sometimes use the axes that are on the side as 'wings' for the chariot to take to the sky. also i sometimes just put them down so that when the chariot charges, they cut through the enemy lines. his head is a bit wierd, but i used that kind of head for my custom British figure, &quot;Viceroy Mainbrace&quot; the horse is cool, chariot rocks (not topheavy, stupid) and the little blue thing that attaches to the horse is cool too. 
the armored dock is so cool. it comes with a British captain, which i have too much of. it should have come with just a British soldier. but it is still a really cool dock. the yellow weathered wall is a nice touch, and i love Lego barrels. there are two cannonballs for the rotating cannon, and it has the finest version of the cannon loader pole (black pole, white tip). however, i have had trouble placing it among the rest of my Imperial structures (Imperial Trading Post). i have decided that the color combination goes best with Broadside's Brig, which i will try to get off Ebay. however, it is a French jail/outpost, so i will have to ditch the British flag and just not have one (it looks out of place anyways. 
the instructions are confusing. not confusing to make, but confusing to open right. while trying to open them, i ripped part of them, but only at the seam, so nothing was lost. this is a great set, worth alot more now that it is long since retired. try to get it, as it is a lot for a little. there are 69 pieces, but it costs so little (it proabably used to cost something like $4.99). all in all great set. pick up if able.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-05T17:56:34.7Z","Castle vs. Pirates","This is a nice value pack with a castle set and a pirates set. If you like those themes, this is a good idea to get. The chariot is OK but not the best, but you get a minifig knight and some supplies. The pirate set has a small harbor and a redcoat minifig. Both of these sets are great and deserves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-19T15:12:46.983Z","Two small sets from awesome themes makes a nice value pack","This is a value pack released in 1994, and it includes two sets, one is the 1794 and the other is the 1795. The sets included are, one of the castle theme, and other of the pirates theme. Both sets are small, altough these includes useful pieces and features an old style of building and design, still in the classic times of the Lego. The set of the castle theme is simple, and there are two minifigures, a knight and a horse. The knight is a dragon knight and it is simple designed, but nice, and have a helmet (this is increased with some small bricks on the top and sides, unlike some of the former helmets, and unlike the current helmets)and a sword. The horse is the common horse of the Lego style, it is brown, with few black details and is increased with a red helmet that fit well on it. The building involved, is a cart, that have some pieces like the plate with a different shape to connect the horse to the cart, and two common small wheels, used in some other carts of the castle theme. Above the plates that fit the wheels, there are some bricks that makes the place that the minifigure stays, and this have space to two or three minifigures. The cart features some black and blue bricks, with few red on it. On each side, there is an axe, a long axe in the old style. The playability is not the better, because the set is small, but this is an addition to the castle sets, can increase some other carts. The other set included, from the pirates theme, is another small set of a classic theme. It is basic and features a good design and color scheme (some white or yellow bricks that makes the wall, and some blue schemes on the plate used as a base). This includes a minifigure of a soldier, simple but cool, and this have a sword, a pistol and a hat. The building involved, made above a blue plate, is basic, altough the result is nice. The walls om  a part of the front and on a side, have the yellow and whhite color, with a sticker, featuring uncolored bricks. Unlike some stickers used currently, this still good in the set, and it have some of the transparent color, making a part of the original color still. The wall have a &quot;hole&quot;, on the center, to fit a cannon on it, and it is another addition, it works well firing the small balls. The set is also increased with a flag and a characteristic small brown barrel. This is another small set f the 1990's years that altough isn't much playable, it can increase another sets, due to it, these sets that were small and cheap, are nice. In comparison with other small sets, these still good. The price wasn't cheaper than these separated, but it was cheap in compariosn with some other sets in the same nunber of pieces or size, a value pack that is now another Lego rarity. Overall, the Lego had make a great value pack with two small sets. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Chrinchy","2020-07-28T15:47:02.563Z","Two Great Ideas In One Set","<p>Just so everyone knows who reads this, I had this set as a child and now I have it again as an adult, so I will do my best to reflect both views in this review.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>A nice double pack set that isn&#39;t necessary but is&nbsp;fun to build and add to your collection.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>Both sets are small with not many pieces which is what this supposed to be like, so I have no problems with that. The instructions were really simple and easy to follow both as a kid and as an adult so at least my comprehension and understanding hasn&#39;t got worse now that I&#39;m getting older :P</p>

<p>Building a small outpost with a cannon, flag and arch way was really fun and exciting. At the same time building a chariot with a knight and horse was equally fun and exciting that I have a hard time deciding which one is my favourite even to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>1 Knight, 1 Red Coat Officer, 1 Cannon, 1 Horse, 1 Barrel, 1 Archway and brick wall, 1 base plate, and lots of weapons and building pieces make up this set. The parts you get are fantastic I have no complaints, my only small nitpick is that the Chariot Knight does not get a shield which is a bummer, but he does get 1 sword, 1 whip and 2 axes, so he is about attacking not defending I suppose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One interesting note is the cannon comes with a black stick, which is not unusual, but on the end of the black stick is a small white peg you attach. I have no idea the purpose of it and it&#39;s something not seen on any other set with a cannon so strange but unique!</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>As a kid who loved pirates, knights and space, I played with these sets a lot and loved mixing them up, taking them apart and using pieces elsewhere. As an adult re building it and putting it on display, it&#39;s a lot of fun to look at and have them posed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Your Money</strong></p>

<p>My parents couldn&#39;t afford big sets and as a kid I never understood why, as an adult now I know. But my parents always tried to make it up to me with what they could afford to get me. I wish I could go back and show them I appreciated what they did. The Imperial Cannon set is small but it definitely feels like an Imperial Fort and same with the Chariot Knight, they seem small, but they make you feel like you have a bigger set than you really do and I certainly enjoy that!</p>
