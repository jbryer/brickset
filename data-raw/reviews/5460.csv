"Novelty","2007-04-07T08:06:18.63Z","Call of Cthulhu","This set is reminiscent of Harry Potter Lego and that's not a favourable comparison.  Arkham has always been depicted as one large building and it is a disappointment to see that the building has been split into three sections... and even then it's not really complete.

What is there is good though - a greenhouse chamber for Poison Ivy, a behind bars tower for the Riddler and a jail cell for the Scarecrow complete with spooky looking conical roof and a collapsable wall.

The vehicles are run of the mill and seems, like some batman vehicles to be copied from other sets.  The glider is almost an updated version of the Ninja set, Nightwing's motorcycle and the Ambulance seems to have come from the City theme's Police force.

The main gate though is a disappointment and the main building even more so.  It is a nice touch to have jail cells for Joker, Two Face and the Penguin, but the main gripe is that all 3 doors to these cells open at the same time.  None of the doors can be individually opened.  The interrogation room is just creepy and is reminiscent more of a villian's torture chamber than part of the asylum.

Also missing from the set is the cryogenic chamber for Mr. Freeze and perhaps something for Clayface.  This is a good attempt from Lego, but they need to move away from Harry Potter and copying from other themes and instead give the Batman theme an identity of its own.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-26T04:50:51.913Z","Not as good as it could have been...","Well, I'm sad to say that the Arkham Asylum set isn't the best it could be. I was so excited to find out that LEGO was making it in the first place, and with THREE new baddies, nonetheless! But...it falls short of expectations.

PROS
+Scarecrow! Riddler! Poison Ivy! Nightwing! (although Scarecrow/Riddler can be gotten later this summer)
+Another building to display alongside the Batcave instead of a slew of Bat-vehicles
+The prison-door opening feature is great. I actually LIKE that all three open at once--reminds me of the Asylum in lockdown. One of the villains hits a switch, and they all go free!
+Specialized containment for Ivy is pretty cool

CONS
-Riddler's cell leaves something to be desired
-The set just doesn't feel &quot;complete&quot;--a bunch of random buildings that look more like Harry Potter than Batman themed.
-Pretty bland to look at, nothing terribly special
-The GATES are the coolest part of Arkham--they should be WAY bigger!
-The price is just not worth the product...wait for a sale!

BOTTOM LINE
If you need a new LEGO Batman set, get it. But otherwise, I'd wait for the sale. Although this is apparently discontinued by LEGO already, and only a TRU exclusive. Ugh.

"AddictedToStyrene","2007-09-26T03:56:44.047Z","Good set apart from torture room","I agree with most of the previous reviews. This was a set with great bits and pieces in it. Each one of the mini-buildings is good, and fun to play with. I especially liked the three cells with the door opening mechanism. Imagine one of the villains tricking the guards and freeing all the others at the same time!

However, as a whole, the pieces would have been better if they had been joined up somehow. Links between the separate stages, like Jabba's Palace, or a big moulded base like the bigger police and fire stations. 
Also, this set contained the first faulty piece of Lego I have ever seen (I have a couple of hundred sets totalling about 70,000 pieces).
You can see it at my Brickshelf Gallery - 
http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=267687

Lastly, even though this is a fictional asylum from a superhero comic with some pretty dark themes, I didn't like that there was a torture room, with saw blades and whips. That's okay in Batman the comic, not good in Lego sets.

"galruach","2007-07-20T19:06:10.437Z","O.k but not great.","  This is a good set but is not without its problems. The minifigures are excellent however I felt Nightwings hair was just a little to big. The batman figure is identical to the one in every other set. Poison Ivy, The Riddler and The Scarecrow are all good but I thought the Scarecrows hat was too big. 
  I don't agree with the decision to split Arkham into all the seperate buildings. It makes it easier to play with and more flexible to set up but I think it would have felt much more like Arkham if it had been built as one single building, more like how the castle sets design their castles. 
  I didn't have a problem with the way certain parts of the asylum look sinister such as the interrogation room as Arkham has always been rather messed up. Similarly the doors opening at the same time is a nice effect and excellent for breakouts but not for moving individual prisoners. The vehicles are a nice addition but nothing special. 
  Whilst this isn't a great set it's good to see lego trying to make some sets that aren't just Batman vehicles. I was dissapointed to see that &quot;The Bat-Tank: The Riddler and Bane's Hideout&quot; is really just a Bat-Tank and the hideout consisted of a flimsy looking pair of gates. I think a villains lair would be excellent but it has to be done better than that. Perhaps Penguins lounge or the Jokers carnival.

"Stash","2007-11-24T13:50:55.543Z","Great set with lots of cool pieces and potential.","I haven't actually opened mine yet (unfortunately I have nowhere to put all my new lego sets so they are staying sealed until I move) but I have some general comments and a few things to say based on other reviews. This is my first review (woot; I just discovered the AFOL community) so here we go.

As far as the fact that the buildings are separate and not combined, this doesn't really bother me that much. I think lego expects people to add in pieces and bases and modify the designs some if that is what you are inclined to do (as I usually am). It is nice to have things ready to go perfectly out of the box, but I do not feel that the design is inherently flawed. If you want to modify to a single building, go for it! Seeing how you can &quot;think outside the box&quot; so to speak is half the fun in my opinion and makes for great challenges. As it is, I like modular designs so that it makes it easy to pick and choose the modules you want to use more easily and the rest are good for extra parts or other modifications. 

I am sad to hear that once again stickers are a problem, but I can see a possible benefit to this. Sometimes uniquely shaped bricks are intended for use with a sticker, but without the sticker, the brick can be used somewhere else for a less explicit purpose, so maybe that is a benefit in some ways (just trying to find some good there....). 

The minifigs in the set are really really great. I think the 2 guards are my favorites and they were definitely one of the reasons I had for picking up the set along with all the other rare bricks. I am not sure if this is just a flaw on the box, but the asylum scarecrow figure looks more orange than the scarecrow fig in the copter chase set. Nobody in either review has commented on this and I don't have the other set. I am basing this based on the color choices shown on each box. The batman may be the same as all the other sets, but I didn't have one yet so no downside for me there. Ivy, riddler, and nightwing are also included and they aren't too shabby, though I would have liked to have seen some printed legs/arms on at least some of the figures. 

I think this set has a ton of great pieces and a lot of potential despite a few flaws. Not perfect out of the box it seems but it looks like a great platform to expand the asylum into something bigger. The key components are here and with some other bricks it could really be filled out.

I don't think the price is necessarily too high, but I did get my copies on sale. 

Very few things are bringing this down from a 5 to a 4 for me, but at least the stickers are a significant gripe. I prefer the printed bricks. I also think that providing at least some type of a base, even if it is just a flat sheet (so that making these modifications is easier), is something that lego should go back to. You can never have too many of those I think and at least one of the sets in each series should probably have one. Minifig inclusion is definitely getting better in the larger sets but perhaps a third guard could have been included. I don't think you can have too many of those either. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2008-05-16T12:35:39.7Z","Azkaban Asylum (could be...why not?)","Like what I’ve said before, I’ll be making another review of this set. Although I don’t have this set, I was able to take a good look at its details in the internet. Well, in terms of the exterior appearance, I should say that it really looks good. It should be one of the LEGO models for Halloween, along with the Shrieking Shack and other horror-themed sets. I like the main building of Arkham Asylum; it has a similar structure with the Harry Potter Castles. I also like the color combination of the buildings—the black and brown bricks really created a nice effect on the outward appearance of the Asylum. On the ground floor, there is a sliding gate made of black steel. It can be moved by pulling the lever underneath it. There is also a computer for the asylum guards; I guess this is used to open the cells located on the second floor, and the sliding steel gate as well. There are three prison cells labeled with three names: Joker, Two-Face, and Penguin. Though these three villains are not present in the set, they are probably reserved for them in case the owner has other Batman sets. The third and topmost floor is the so-called “torture / interrogation room” (as mentioned by other brickset reviewers). It contains a whip, a chainsaw, a skull, some chemicals, and electronic gadgets. There is also a bed with a lamp overhead and a white rope (probably several bed sheets tied together for escaping purposes—as mentioned in the LEGO Batman website). The center of the roof can be opened to allow the prisoners to escape as seen in the pictures. There is an antenna which can be used as a stand for Batman’s glider. 

	Next is the one located on the left side of the main building. It is actually intended for Scarecrow and Poison Ivy. The top floor has a collapsible prison door and it does collapse / topple down once the Scarecrow uses his scythe. The windows are enclosed in barbed wires and there is even a skull with a hat in front of the building. This is to indicate Scarecrow’s Prison cell. There are even hays inside the cell (the tan-colored logs) along with a small barrel. Directly below Scarecrow’s prison is Poison Ivy’s plant chamber (or greenhouse as again mentioned by other reviewers). The cylindrical glass doors have stickers of two Venus Fly-Traps) and inside the cell are growing poisonous plants (obviously). There is a lock on top of the glass cylinders; this is definitely and again obviously used to prevent Poison Ivy’s escape. Now, what I don’t get is the cell for Riddler. I’m not really sure what the green question marks are for. They are probably designed to somehow create a “Riddler” effect. On top of his cell is a storage room nfor weapons. There’s nothing really special about this floor, not to mention it’s too low for a Prison Tower. Speaking of tower, there is a guard/ watch tower for the asylum guards. It has a spotlight (with the batman sign) on top which is used to summon the Dark Knight into action. The main gates and ambulance are okay I guess, but the gates really remind me of Hogwarts Castle (4757). There are seven minifigures include plus a motorbike and glider. Over-all, I like this set, despite the rants and raves I’ve read from Brickset Reviews. This would definitely be a fine addition to my Harry Potter sets (since there is no Azkaban set released). Arkham Asylum deserves four out of five stars!

"sabpol","2008-02-08T23:45:42.903Z","Not worth paying full price","I would have never paid full price for this set, but I couldn't resist buying it when I saw it 75% off at TRU this week, marked down to $24.90 USD.  

It has a decent selection of bricks - mostly black, dark gray, light gray, and brown.  It has an impressive number of minifigs - 7 - including 2 security guards.  It has a large number of those black fence pieces also, a gate, and tudor-style brown door, as well as numerous U-styled tudor windows.  I bought this set chiefly for the bricks to do mocs.

The mechanism that locks the 3 cells in the main building is clever.  Pull the lever on the side, and all 3 cell doors close.  The ambulance is farily large, probably too large in comparison to the buildings.

I was surprised to find 2 defective bricks in this set.  They are the 1x4 black brick.  One of the tubes on the underside of each brick is too close to the middle tube, throwing the tube spacing off and making it impossible to to attach these bricks to the top of other bricks.  I've requested replacements from LEGO.com.

"Batmaniam","2009-02-20T15:28:58.653Z","""Welcome to Arkham Asylum, We Hope You Like It Here, Because You Will Never Leave BWA-HA-HA(manical laughter)*""","*The title is an exerpt from the comic from this set in the Lego Magazine*
This set is awsome. I love it. I spent most of the summer trying to find it, and finally I found it for $60. An okay price. I am really jealous of the guy who got it for $25. Okay I am going to devide this into 3 parts: the building, the vehicles, and the figs.

MINIFIGS:

Scarecrow: Really nice, sythe has rare ninja sword, plus he has a nice hat, and glow in the dark head! The head is really creepy.

Riddler: Probably my favourite fig in this set, all green, with mask on face, and normal black combed over hair.

Poision Ivy:Long hair, leaves on her front, with legs that look like stockings, or something. You can't get her in any other set, so she is really nice to have.

Two Guards:One is white, and one is black with sunglasses. Dark grey uniforms with badge, belt, and walky talky.

Batman:Normal batman

Nightwing: Black spiky exo-force hair, feels kinf of rubbery. Torso has a white v, and terrible abs (the abs don't look too good compared to the others)

Overal nice figs, 7 in all.

VEHICLES:

Paddy Wagon:Very nice van, bares resemblence to Two Face's van, but not that much. It has a chair, and a stereing wheel with bars behind the seat. It has (in the back) a strecher with arms over it to keep the guy in, and it can slide in the back.

Bat Glider:Batman holds on with his hands. It can perch in two different places on the buildings.

Nightwing's Bike: Just a normal bike, with a whit v sticker on the front, flames in the back, and lightsabre sticks sticking out on the top.

BUILDINGS:

The Main Building: This building has three floors. The first floor has a computer, and a chair, if you push a thing, then bars go in front of the door. The next door has three cells, with the names: Joker, Two-Face, and Penguin, proabably in case you have those figs, and want to put them in your Arkham. Each cell has bars, a table, and a glass of water. Also if you push the technic beam, then all of the doors open together, which is nice for prison breaks. The top floor is the torture room. It has a whip mounted on one wall (you can see it if you look closley on the right side of the top of the building). Inside it has a table with jars, and a skull. There is some type of fire thing to heat up the tools, there is an axe, and a old chain saw piece. On the other side there is a bed with am interogation light. On the outside if you lift up a flap a bed-sheet rope falls out to escape.

The Tower: This is home to Poison Ivy, ans Scarecrow. The bottom floor has plants, and the door has a sticker of some Venus Fly Traps. On top the door it has a pad lock block. The next floor house Scarecrow. It has a barrel to hold his scythe, and bails of plastic hay. The beam that sticks out on the front has a weird guy on it, I don't understand why it is there. But if you push it in, then the door pops of. Scarecrow is the only one who has a function to break out. So he probably breaks out, and lets everyone else out. On the top floor it has a rat. The exterminators must be too scared to come.

Riddlers Building: On the bottom floor  it has bars, and a sticker with question marks on it, and a lock on the top of the bars. On the top floor it has probably a supply type room, it has a rack with extra guns(by the way the guns might look old fashioned, but they a tranqulizer guns. But they do have the tommy gune, and the other one. On the roof it has a bat, and a satelite dish.

The Guard Tower: This is just a tower, with a ladder, and a spotlight to either call Batman, or to pinpoint the escapees. There is also a place to hold a tranqulizer gun.

The Gate: Very nice gate with some weeds growning out of the stone. It has a scary looking sign, and a survielance camera, which can also be used as a news camera while playing. The only thing is that there is no walls around the whole place, and the Batmobile can't fit through the gate only the Bat-Dragster.

Overall one of my favourite sets, only seconded to the Batcave, a couple Technic sets, and my soon to be GENERAL GRIEVOUS(the UCS one)! Get yours now. He is on sale for $50 (half off) at Lego shop. Anyway this is an awsome set lots of functions, lots of figs, and lots of play. It looks really good on the outskirts of my Lego town. 5 out of 5

The minifigures for this set are just okay.  My personal favorites are the two guards and Scarecrow.  The Scarecrow also comes with a scythe that really completes the figure.  

There's nothing special about the Riddler and Batman which can both be found in other sets.   Exclusive to this set are Nightwing and Poison Ivy, however these figures are mediocre at best.  Nightwing has a bizarre emo haircut, and the Poison Ivy hairpiece and monochromatic theme is also less than inspirational.

Minifig Rating:  3.5/5.0

The Buildings:  Watchtower, Asylum Gate, Poison Ivy/Scarecrow Tower, Riddler Tower, Main Asylum Holding Cell

The Watchtower and Asylum gate have the simplest builds, and are by far the most aesthetically pleasing.  I just wish the gate had some extension pieces so that it would have a further reach like in the HP Graveyard Duel set.

The Main Asylum holding cell has room for three infamous inmates: The Joker, Penguin, and Two-Face.  Unfortunately none of these minifigs were included in the set so I hope that you have a few of the other sets to fill this out.  The construction on this piece was difficult especially when fitting the technic pieces that allow for all three cell blocks to open simultaneously, however a bit of hard work is well rewarded by this awesome feature.

The other two character specific Towers leave much to be desired.  Their construction is simple, and really don't add any value to the set.

Building Rating:  4.0/5.0

The Vehicles:  Arkham Ambulance, Bat-Glider, Nightwing Motorcycle

Here's where the designers hit a homerun.  The Ambulance is awesome to build and display, and I really like the stretcher they included to put one of the inmates on.  The Bat-Glider is simple, but looks great overlooking the playset when attached to one of the towers.  The motorcycle is also simple but it accompanies the playset well.

Vehicle Rating: 5.0/5.0

Overall Aesthetics: This set looks great when completed and displayed.  Multiple buildings mean that you can space this set out according to your preference.  The designers nailed the color scheme which is perfect for the upcoming Halloween season.  I would give this set a full 4.5 out of 5.0 stars, however they lose 0.5 points due to a lack of creativity as this set is basically a knock-off of the 4709 HP Hogwarts Castle.

"AETerry","2011-06-06T14:53:14.53Z","Arkham Asylum Review","<p>At first I wasn't sure how I was ultimately going to like this set. It is one of the larger LEGO Batman themed sets at about $80 when it first came out and was on shelves. Like the Batcave set, Arkham Asylum features one of the set, permanent and well known locations within the Batman universe. This is the place, when he captures a villian, that they get sent to for lock up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where Minifigures are concerned, you've got a grand total of seven minifigures which is about on par for sets of this size. You've got Batman, whom can be tedious or repetitive to get based upon how many of the sets you've been able to collect or have gotten. You get a second minifigure of Riddler and Scarecrow if you've gotten the other Batman sets that they come with. This is the set to get so you can have Poison Ivy and Nightwing as they don't feature in any other Batman sets. Two Security Guards for the Asylum. Where these two are concerned, I feel there could have been one more Guard and possibly at least one doctor for this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle wise you've got an Ambulance for transporting prisoners/inmates in and then a motorcycle for Nightwing. The motorcycle is one of the newer styles of motorcycles that LEGO has been putting out in sets lately and I'm rather partial to these new ones as well as the older models. The Ambulance is a decent, solid build. The stickers (yes there are stickers) threw me for a moment as one of them is reverse writing, but then it hit me that's if you're looking in a review mirror and see it coming up behind you, you can see what it is and pull over as is the case for all Emergency Vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Asylum itself is good when you look at it as a whole, when taking a moment to look at it more critically, I can't help but feel there should have been a more enclosed feel to it. Like more of the buildings should be attached or a perimeter fence needs to be added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gate section is good for the Ambulance to drive through and the security camera that watches the comings and goings. It's here with this build that imagination needs to allow for that there should be a wall going all around the Asylum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next build I'll refer to as a Guard Tower. There's a huge search light for lighting up the grounds at night when an Inmate or Prisoner escapes. when I get the luxury to do so, I may see about adding a second tower like this to my set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've got then two ""tower structures"" that are some of the jail cells for Villians, one's for Riddler and the other is clearly for Poison Ivy with all the vines growing in her cell. With Riddler's cell, it seems a little odd that the armory is right above him. With Ivy's Cell, you have what appears to be an attic or storage area, it's here that Scarecrow is either imprisoned at when he's captured, or he's hiding out in, in order to spring the other inmates free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final Building is what I call the ""Main Building."" There are three levels to it. Out on top is a pole with Batman's Hang Glider on it, suggesting that he's coming in for a landing or circling around the place. The bottom floor has a standard Guard Post and place for admitting people and inmates. It's a bit sparse, but has some good detail for what's there. The second floor has three cells for Joker, Penguin and Two-Face. A small mechanism makes it so when you pull on it, all three doors open at once. Useful when you're playing out a scene where it's a mass prison break. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to be honest, after having looked at the top, third floor and seeing the ""Hospital Room"" area for treating the inmates, I'd want to escape too. The level of tech for dealing with Insanities is barbaric and primative. Plus, as commented before, there's only two prison guards and the instruction manual shows the Guards treating and restraining the prisoners, operating on them. This is where I'd say have a doctor on hand. Otherwise it's run away!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of LEGO fun for both LEGO &amp; Batman collectors, this is still overall a good set and worth getting so you have a set location. There's a goodly ammount of details and minifigures unique or uncommon to get in this set. I've greatly enjoyed putting this set together even with some changes I'd make to it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
