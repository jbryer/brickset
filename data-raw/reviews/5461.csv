Hmmm...","I probably would have never bought this set (my wife doesn't understand my love of the brick) until I saw it on sale at Target for the low, low price of $24.98.  Ever since I go back to Target every Friday (markdown day!!!) searching for cheap legos.  

Anyway, on to the review...

Pros:

At full price, this thing comes in at just under $0.07/element--still not too shabby.  I love the technic cars and while this isn't technically technic (it's a &quot;racer,&quot; supposedly) it's made almost entirely of technic elements, pins, and panels.  It comes with a decent part inventory as well, including 11 1x13s, 16 1x15s, and 10 double bent liftarms.  The panel selection is a bit lame with only 4 large, 2 mediums, and 4 smalls, all in black and red though.
  
The pop-up flatscreen/video game feature is kinda novel and fun to play with for a while.  It has a neat &quot;speaker&quot; setup including two small panels stickered to look like amps.  It has two &quot;nitrous&quot; bottles.  The only other moving part is the hood.
The coolest looking part on the whole thing is the grille--its pretty spiffy.  Also, it comes with the smaller racing rims in black, a nice touch.  The only other set that offers them in black is the 1:10 Enzo.

Has pretty decent look overall and the emptiness of the chassis leaves tons of room for modification.

Cons:

The whole hood area leaves much to be desired.  The massive supercharger-shaped &quot;brick&quot; (to stretch the definition of the word) is monstrously lame, as is the rest of the engine itself.  It's designed and stickered to look like a big-block V8 but comes off looking cheap.  The good news is that the lack of functionality leaves plenty of room to gut the whole thing and put in your own engine.  I've found that the bionicle 5x5 shield with three top fins (part# 41664) makes a very realistic-looking circular-style blower.  

Further, the steering is only hand-of-god and doesn't leave much room to fix it without serious modification--I haven't gotten around to that...all in good time.
There are, of course, multibrick stickers, but I never put them on.  

The overall verdict--love it.  It's a pretty fun if technically-lacking build that leaves you with plenty of room for personalization, plus it's great for relatively cheap inventory expansion.  Pick one up, unless of course you're married to a lego-hating banshee like I am.  (Just kidding baby, you know I love you)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SoxRockPatsRule","2012-05-01T00:45:49.543Z","In a nutshell?....... Eh!","<p>it's a GOOD thing i traded for this set, and didn't spend actual hard earned money on it, because after the build, i kind of felt... i don't know... betrayed? for lack of a better word... no unique parts, no AHA! moments, kind of flimsy, doors don't open, no moving pistons in the motor, just a molded plastic engine... the ONLY cool thing about this set, is&nbsp;when you pull down the tailgate, the bed pops up to reveal a LARGE television screen, complete with sound system and video game system with controllers... THAT'S IT!... i recommend using this one as parts for your other technic sets... like i said, good thing it was free (basically).</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 - pop up sound system with television and gaming system</li><li>Pro 2 - no more... just that one... unless you need a parts set, then this is it!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 - flimsy</li><li>Con 2 - cheap engine</li><li>Con 3 - NOT worth $50 in REAL money, worth trading for ($30-$35)</li><li>Con 4 - doors don't open</li><li></li></ul>
<p>bottom line?... if you can get it for around $30 to $35, then i'd say go for it... because that's all it's worth... DO NOT SPEND FULL RETAIL!... disappointed.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
