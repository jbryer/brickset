When he got it, he first sat on the captains cabin, held the mast like a biker and used the ship as a Bobby-Car. Check. Now you'll hear the Wah-Wah-Wah-siren of the fire truck before the ship comes around the corner - steered by the mighty Duplo-shark. Yes, he loves it.

Dimensions:
65 cm long, 48 cm tall and 13 cm wide IS huge. One kid + this ship and the tub is full.

Assembling:
Very easy and should only take some minutes, until your kid(s) are able to conquer the dangerous seas. The 2 masts with sails are clicked on special locations (4 knobs each) on the deck and - once they are placed - very difficult to de-attach. So these are the only parts where an adult should give a hand.

Bright side of the moon:
+ Ship is very solid
+ Roof of the captain's cabin can be lifted
+ Three little wheels underneath the ship protect your italian marble from scratches
+ Anchor is made of rubber
+ Really cool oversized weapons

Dark side of the moon:
- Monkey has no moveable legs
- Ship is not waterproof
- Painting is not really accurate (f.e. the windows)

Additional stuff:
I bought this ship (and the Black Castle) new and sealed in a little dusty toy shop for a real bargain. If you are searching the flea market, make sure that the knobs for the masts are not broken. Otherwise the masts will pop of faster than you can say ""Aye"". The Duplo cannon ball was taken away by us, because our son enjoyed to shoot at his 4 month old sister and the plasma. You will be astonished, how it feels getting hit on a short-range distance...

That's it. Maybe the best toy pirate-ship you can get for your hard earned doubloons. It's a shame that it is no longer produced and the prices are going through the crowsnest. Anyway... Seek out. You won't regret it. And your kid(s) neither ;)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
