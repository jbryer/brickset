Do not be deceived by it's small size as this thing stores a boat load of pieces.  Each level has different sized compartments so that you can organize better.  We have two of them and they probably have close to 500 or 600 pieces in each!  It makes it so much easier to look for parts to finish sets when we buy them at discount on ebay (because they're missing pieces).  I have found only two drawbacks; the first is that the trays are little tricky to put back into the case, but nothing too difficult.  The second problem is that you cannot purchase the trays separately.  Our cat was nice enough to use one of the trays as a litter box(!) and we had to throw it away.  Even after talking to lego management and they in-turn called the warehouse there is no way to purchase the trays on their own.  Well worth the $14 lego sells them for.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
