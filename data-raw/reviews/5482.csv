"eskeleto532","2009-11-29T16:00:02.607Z","One FUNtastic set","I bought this set to begin my MOCing experience, and I loved it, it comes with the Vahki Nuurak and his instruction booklet(however it says in the ""bucket"" that it doesn't include instuctions). As I in that time already had the Nuurak set I used all the Vahki and the set's pieces to build a MOC.
So lets go to the pros 'n cons

»Pros
-Vahki Nuurak set
-Shadow Kraata(yes it has the special edition Shadow Kraata)
-lots of usefull blades and armor

»Cons
-you can only make one decent MOC out of this(I tried to make more than one MOC but they turned out realy weard)
-this isn't realy a good choise if you want to create MOCs
-if you don't already have the Vahki this set isn't very usefull
