"Monty","2006-06-28T05:47:26Z","Just Like Chicken","Let me say first off this is a superb set, which in the traditions of UCS is very accurate when compared to prototype. I realise the Lego designers give it their best shot within their parameters, but that is not to say that there is nothing for the tweakers to do. With the original trilogy on DVD at last, freeze frame and zoom allows for very detailed comparisons to prototype.

There are two instruction books one for the legs/feet and base and one for the body. The legs and feet are made up of a mixture of Technic and normal parts and it uses the same rotating click hinges as the AT-AT which allow you to pose the finished model. They look fairly accurate to prototype. The holes in the rear of the base should be hexagonal – so there may be room for alterations here. I also think there should be another cable hanging down under the front main canon. There is a turntable brick (I have not personally seen one quite like this before) to ensure the body can rotate in relation to the legs, The body is made up as per prototype of angled armour plates. They are fixed with a mix of hinges axles and Technic connectors and it is kept under tension by means of an internal rubber band holding the 2 sides together against the front plate – the back and top plates hinge up and over. The tension is not enough to make it implode like the famous logs crushing scene in the movie, but it might be a problem if you want to add a detailed cockpit interior. I think the area which I may change is the recessed dark grey angled plates used to form the shape of the windows – I feel these may look better replaced with the light grey equivalent as on the prototype and flush with the main armoured front plate – it will be trial and error I guess. I also feel the handrails on the roof and the way the hatch hinges open could benefit from some alteration, but the latter might be difficult. The back of the body may benefit from changes above the fans as the bricks used really are a compromise. The side gatlin gun is very well done using binoculars. 

As the model literally stands on its own two feet you only get the standard UCS card (sticker) – only other sticker is for the detail between the windows – this is shown well in the movie’s Chewie to the rescue scene, but in others it just seems to be a blank plate so it could be left off and replaced with a tile and be equally authentic. 

I like to try and keep my boxes in mint condition – especially expensive Star Wars and UCS sets, so I was a little disappointed to find that this box is one of the new “tear the back corners to open” variety. On most occasions, no matter how careful I am, I find it impossible to make a clean tear, which I think spoils the box and second-hand values. For an UCS set I should have thought a proper box - possibly embossed would have been more appropriate.

I thought the price 60 GBP was about right – I’m sure this would have been 80 had it been issued a couple of years ago

This is a great set my qualms are minor, so it definitely rates a maximum score – now for an UCS AT – AT please.

"Evilnurn","2007-03-18T23:54:19.06Z","Good but flawed...","I got this set in December with high expectations having had the Y-Wing UCS edition. I was very impressed with the building of the set, no matter how repetitive, as I expected it to be tedious with such detail. The construction was very well done, but when its done it is extremely prone to being destroyed. I had it on a sturdy table and one small shake and it all went down and broke into many pieces.

The detail on this set, however, impressed me greatly. The blasters are very well done, as are the detail on the legs. I would have liked, though, to have some more rotation on the actual head and slightly more maneuverability. Although this had to be sacrificed for detail.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"nicolais","2007-10-17T10:20:47.153Z","Great detail and a solid model","This is my first UCS assembled and I have to say I'm very impressed. I also got the Millennium Falcon  - no. 7733 yay :D

It's been a while since I bought or assembled any LEGO model so getting back to LEGO and combining it with Star Wars is a great mix for me.

The first leg took me almost 2 hours to make and the 2nd one came around somewhat quicker. This happened during the course of 3 days and I made the head last night to finish the model.

The only thing that comes to mind in sense of bad design is the handle on the top lid of the head. At least my brick was on very loosely so I had to put on the smallest bolt I could find (1 spare included luckily).

Other than that I found the model nicely detailed and very robust for a &quot;display only&quot; unit. I haven't tried walking with its legs nor do I intend to, so I won't comment on that part.

It would only be fair to give this 5 of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"savepuffy","2007-12-21T23:03:47.81Z","Good but a little flimzy","I'm starting off by saying that this set is a challenging good build and highly recomended.  The detail is insane and awesome! I remember when I first built the foot I thought to my self that if you hit someone on the head with it you could knock them out. Solid set.  WARNING: DON'T accidentely hit head if you do more than likely you're gonna have to rebuild the entire head again which is really annoying!   I've done it 2 times. WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T FORGET THE LITTLE 2x2 PLATE ON TOP OF CENTRAL BLASTERS!  You'll regret it if you do!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"gold682","2008-01-09T07:09:04.36Z","Very Cool","This was my first build of a UCS set and was pleasantly surprised on the enjoyment I got from putting this thing together and watching it &quot;grow&quot; until I had a VERY impressive detailed model of a AT-ST.

Really is for display, rather than play, but that's not a bad thing as far as i'm concerned. Got it at a good price, so well pleased with the overall result. 

Have now just managed to get a Tie Advanced fighter (10175)for a good price and intend to build this soon.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sudorum","2008-04-05T13:42:07.03Z","Structure Monster","This lego is absolutely great. YOU must buy it! This was a bit more difficult than I had originally anticipated(a lot of repetition and piece searching took place), and the legs can actually move if you're careful not to disrupt its firm yet delicate structure. The head is the best, held together with rubber bands and technic pieces in a creative manner I have never seen utilized before. The circular hatch on top can open, along with the whole top of the head. The head can also turn a limited radius from left to right. This set is not in minifigure scale like the Millennium Falcon, but rather in supersize scale compared with the figures.",FALSE,5,5,4,3,4
"Buckbrick","2008-07-29T21:18:21.123Z","This is about the best built experience ever","The UCS AT-ST has everything you want in a Lego set: good number of pieces at a great price, astounding detail and scale, outstanding built experience and of course - its a Star Wars UCS! You get a mixture of system and technic parts. You essentially build the skeleton frame and begin attaching detailed armour pieces to flesh the walker out. It is fun to watch the unit build from the legs to the torso and finally the head. Oh yeah, the guns and grenade launcher are probably the best details in the set.

There are reports on the unit being wobbly. This is caused by the fact that the torso/turret assembly is attached to the 2 legs via only 2 technic pins, with no way of modifying it to give it more stability. This is perhaps the only gripe in this otherwise perfect set. It's a non-issue - UCS sets are not meant for play anyway. Otherwise, the set seemed strong enough to withstand the Endor attack. In all, I had the most fun ever in a Lego build. At this price, a Star Wars fan cannot possibly pass up on this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"scbunch","2009-01-07T20:59:31.607Z","First star wars set","I saw this set on sale directly from the lego store and decided to buy it.  I hadn't built or owned any lego sets since I was a child and thought it would be fun.  I think I spawned a monster because I fell in love with Lego all over again and the star wars sets are just awesome.  So this was the first set in my collection I recently started.  The only complaint is that some times the instructions are hard to see where the pieces go because everything is the grey color but I was able to stare at it long enough to finally figure it out.  That's the fun of building right?  On another note, I was missing a piece from the set and went to Lego's customer support website and filled out the form for the piece I was missing.  Less than three weeks later I received it in the mail with no cost to me.  I tip my hat to Lego for great customer support.  I highly recommend this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"koponant","2009-02-24T06:45:49.437Z","Most Impressive","While fragile, unstable and a bit cumbersome to build, this set is one of the most wonderful looking I've ever seen. Somehow Lego parts fit perfectly into the coarse look (which reminds WWII tanks) of armored Imperial fighting machines.  This one belongs on a pedestal.

The set is not intended to be played by children, yet some of them might want to build cockpit inside The Monster -- although the set is not in the same scale as minifigs are. There is a lot of room for other modifications also.

There are some cool ideas in the design of set, such as little hatches in the driver/gunner vents, rotating grenade launcher and good use of inclined vertical plates on front, sides and rear.

"darthdc","2009-07-29T09:58:32Z","One of the best UCE models ever","This set awesome to look at - when the designers got to work on this, they certainly went overtime to get the model looking as realistic as it is.
So things to mention:

It doesn't walk (wouldn't stand otherwise) though the hips are loose.
The side panels are held together with an elastic band, which could be placed nearer the back allowing for a cockpit interior to be made.
It stands at around 18 inches tall (I haven't measured it so cannot say exactly how tall it is) so its a really big model.
At £50 it actually well priced

Very well detailed and worth getting. A must for any SW collector

"mattypatty","2019-12-05T01:11:30.033Z","My first UCS set","<p>I got this set in 2009 back when it was new, and it was my first ucs set, and only one until I&nbsp;got the the Falcon last year.&nbsp; I was 13 when I&nbsp;got this set and thought it was kinda cool, and as mostly all I did with my Lego sets was display them, it fit in.&nbsp; Now being older and having many more UCS sets its still one of my favorites, I&nbsp;just rebuilt&nbsp;it about a month ago and the build is fairly simple, but has lots of fun techniques.&nbsp; It is not the strongest set and pieces often fall off of it when moving it, so it is not meant to be played with at all.&nbsp; It&nbsp;stands quite tall and is just slightly shorter then the UCS&nbsp;Slave I for reference.&nbsp; When it was released it was priced at a steal, which is why I&nbsp;could afford it at 13, nowadays its worth quite a bit more so it&#39;s really up to you if your willing to spend more then 3 times its original price for it used.&nbsp; Overall a great set for adult/teen collectors, not a great set for kids looking for something to play with.</p>
