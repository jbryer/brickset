There are a few good parts (mudguards, wheels/tires, and curved slope parts) but this is a cheap looking and extremely light TT. This should not even be under the TT Racers theme as it is an embarrassment to the Racers.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"iabstract","2009-01-20T18:35:24.31Z","Mediocre Racer Enhanced by Packaging","By itself, this set isn't much.  The simple design could probably be put together with spare parts from other sets.

However, it should be noted that this came with two other brickmaster sets, #7452 and #7453.  Also included were instructions for combining the 3 sets into a different vehicle.  Because of this, it's hard to review this set without taking those into consideration, and that's why I give it a 4 overall.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Bob_Clear","2013-12-13T22:33:09.943Z","Not a great set, but useful spare parts","i got this set at LegoLand in 2008. It's really small, and has no stickers or anything special for that matter. The lack of an interesting TT is made up for by the fact that all these parts can be used to build custom TTs.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
