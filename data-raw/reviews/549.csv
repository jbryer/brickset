I do not agree with the bottom, this set was a great invasion piece...plus i had great memories trying invade &quot;aquashark land&quot;....

"legoman4694","2009-07-14T11:37:01.2Z","make sure to get the crystal board!","this is actually a strange set. With the big yellow wheels and propellers on both sides, it can drive some people away. dont be fooled. this is a very interesting build. the propellers can be arches up and stay, thanks to a spring brick. also THERE ARE NO STICKERS. however there are only 2 printed pieces.

the figure is also very cool. he has a huge helmet and some cool green glasses. the body is a reqular aquazone body for this time though.

the big blue board is also very cool. while it has no connecters for building, the crystal crawler can ride right on top of it. the board is very hard to find now because there are no lego studs on it so people selling this set wont know this goes with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T15:19:04.81Z","Weird, but cool, yet . . . where are the accessories?","An overall great set for the Aquazone sereis, BUT, there's a problem here... aside from the bush and knives, there aren't any accesories or monsters!(oh no). This set loses it's 2 points since it could easily of had a crystal or an octopus or even a shark. Sure the set can be used creatively, even with those huge wheels it still has plenty of great parts, and the design is ingenious, especially with the springloaded positioning system, giving the ship an all-terrain feel since the propellors could easily launch the ship up vertical slopes.

The set loses its value because on its own (unless it had the baseplate, then it is 4/5) it had nothing, it was as good as an awesome house with nothing inside. A single crystal would do this set wonders, a shark or octopus would make it a definite 5/5, so a note for all listening, a great set with no playability is just parts, there must be a purpose!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
