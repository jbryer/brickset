I can't say im surprised that I'm the 7th person to flag this as &quot;i own this&quot; but I am going to try and do this model justice. Well this model is the true shape of a helicopter and fits in well with the old basic series. It has a mixed colour scheme of red, blue, white and black, with some clear crystal pieces too. To look at it you would think I can build that from any basic set and you probably could but it wouldn't be quite right as this set has some rare pieces.

Firstly I want to point out the pin which the top rotor sits on. It has three groves cut into it unlike the usual two we get now. This really adds to the strength required to take it off. Also the back mounting bracket is unlike any thing from the 90's or that you will get today.

The weirdest part of this model is its not symmetrical. one side has two studs sticking out below the rotor. Now you can hold it here and spin the rotor at the same time without hitting you hand so I am to assume its a holding point if you wanted to take a photo or something.

Overall I give this little one a 6/10. It's a pretty decent model for it's age and shouldn't be overlooked by any collector. Might not suit too much new school play but its a nice one just to have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
