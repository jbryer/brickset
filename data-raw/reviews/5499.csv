"Ernst","2012-01-16T17:39:38.487Z","The Swiss Chalet, a charming house.","<p>Overall 4 bricks: This is one of small serie of European houses LEGO made in those years. No spectacular&nbsp;building but you can see it is a small Swiss house by its architecture. Like all early sets it is basic, simple but good. A nice set for a vintage LEGOLAND town scenery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks: this is nice basic building, it is all simple and symetric. First floor with 2 small front windows, a door and a backwindow with hatches. Nothing to be opened still in these years. The second floor is (Swiss style) bigger then the first with also windows with hatches back and front and a small balcony strangly without a fence. All is built with small white bricks. The roof also symetrical with big red slopes and to finish&nbsp;the top&nbsp;a white chimney and the famous roof antenna. A nice red fence, a tree&nbsp;and tiles to finish the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks: the bricks used for the house are not really special but the big red slopes are very good, just like the antenna and the wonderfull tree in the small garden which make it go to 4 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 2 bricks: when finished there is not really anything left to play with, not even a small car so two bricks is low but right I think. More a lovely set to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value&nbsp;4 bricks: I give 4 because of the price I paid which was € 25,00. It may seem a lot for a small basic set like this but since people offer this set on Bricklink with prices from € 20,00 going up untill € 175,00&nbsp;so I think I made a nice deal. I think an average value of € 60,00 would be plausible if complete with tree and antenna.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4
