"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T01:00:53Z","It Still Works","This was the second Lego Pen I've bought...actually, I take that back it's the first I've bought, my first pen was given to me.

Anyway, it's a pretty cool pen, and two years later, it still works.  I use to to take mid-terms and finals occasionally, just to lighten the mood a little (you know how crabby college students get when they're stressed).

The figure of Maul is quite nifty, though I wonder why Lego couldn't come up with a way for the figure to actually not be a part of the pen, and pop off, but then I guess you'd lose it wouldn't you.

A light saber would have been nice too.
