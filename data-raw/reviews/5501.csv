In front of the station are two gas tanks and a shell sign. The sign is a weak spot, for it usually breaks down one time or the other. If you buy this set, take good care of this part.
The original set places the tanks on the same side, but of course they can be set on different sides of the 2x8 plate. This adds to the use by two cars.  The set has the small door of the days before the minifigure.  To be used with the shell tanker truck of the same age.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
