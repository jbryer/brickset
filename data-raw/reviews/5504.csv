<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a decent number of little pieces and that can be put into other MOCs.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4

I have this brick built rabbit from 1992&nbsp;and another from 1990. I don&#39;t remember many other brick built rabbits from LEGO and it would be nice to get more.</p>

<p>This set looks good. The print is detailed enough for the time and the 1x1 round studs work great as buck teeth. The rabbit seems to be wearing blue pants, a red shirt, and a black top hat with a red stripe. Unlike the one from 1990, this one has the feet out to th side and it seems to be squatting down more that standing. It is cartoony, but fun as a small toy for kids.</p>

<p>Overall I like this set, though it is not the best. This can be chalked up to it being an older model, but this also makes it kind of charming. It is nothing to spend a lot of money to get new, but it is still nice to have.</p>

One special print pieces in the face of the rabbit. Easy to build for younger lego fans. Need to keep the poly bag as I don&#39;t remember any paper directions coming in the bag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got one of these as a kid and still have it today to display around Easter time with the newer Easter related sets that have been released in recent years. Showing this next to the newer more complex sets kind of shows off a lego evolution in building skills.&nbsp;</p>
