For one the &quot;Bionicle Heroes Game Demo&quot;(I posted a review for the game for the game)didn't exist and the Lego SW 2 one didn't work. The Builder Bot demo isn't worth any exitement either, so thats one disc down, now to the other.On the main disc is the Lego Digital Designer 1.6 which I never used, a Lego Batman video with 3 alternate endings, and they show life sized models of Batman, Bionicle and Exo-Force characters. So read what I wrote and judge for yourself whether it's worth getting or not",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"vezon8764","2008-10-23T19:09:29.543Z","Stupid, but nice at the same time.","The stupid parts are: 1) I don't have a PC, so the second disk is crud to me, 2) Every section has a link to the message boards at lego.com, which is useless. And 3) I already have the 2.0 version of LEGO Digital Designer, and I don't even really use it, so why do I need the lame version 1.6? On the other hand, the videos are nice, and I didn't know that they had made an entire lego city. Also the Alpha Rex movie is cool.
Pros:
Nice videos
Cons:
Useless second CD.
Annoying links to lego.com
Get it so you can see the movies, but that is about it.
See you next review!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
