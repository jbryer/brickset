"Darth_Shockwave","2007-10-03T19:15:56.373Z","A great re-release of a great fighter","First off I'd like to say the X-Wing is my favourite vehicle from all off Star Wars, anyway onto the review. When this set was first announced some people were apprehensive about it, but the way I saw it was, the model was a fleet builder. Simply put when the first model came out in 2004, if you wanted a fleet off them, say 5. Then you'd buy 5, but you'd also have 5 Yoda's huts too. With this set the hut is eliminated, some more figures have been added and you can change the wing designations to pretty much any number in red squadron. I like the colours off this model, I think the whites, reds and greys blend together very nicely, and reminds off the original 70's X-Wing toy. The auto wing feature is great fun, and surprises a lot off people when they see it. The only real big problem I do have withe model is, the guns in my opinion are too short. If you look at the actual prop model in the movie, you'll see that the gun tips extend just past the cockpit. It's easily fixed though.

Pros: - 
Easily customised to other X-Wings
Great update for the design of the vehicle
Auto wings
Nice beefed up look
Lots of mini-figs
Wedge Antilles
Enjoyable to build

Cons: -
The guns should be longer
Wedge should have a different style head, not just a smiley

Overall: - I really like the new re-release. The addition off extra parts for the wings is a nice touch, and unique to this model. Recommend buying this set just so you can build a fleet off X-Wings.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"miies","2007-10-05T20:15:09.217Z","My favorite set right now!","<p>As the title indicates, I&#39;m pretty happy with the X-Wing. I&#39;ve had it for over a month now, and I&#39;m still admiring it when I walk past the shelve on which it stands. It&#39;s however not perfect, as few Lego sets are. I&#39;ve made a few small modifications:<br />
<br />
1) Changed the stupid coney shaped lasers to more accurate &quot;Harry Potter Magic Wand&quot; stick thingies. If you have four of these wands, you should stick them in the laser dishes.<br />
2) I hated the stupid rear landing &quot;gear&quot; (two sloped bricks). I&#39;ve created a fully working set of folding rear legs, using some old and new hinge parts.<br />
3) Added slots in the cargo compartment to firmly hold the light saber and a hand laser gun (not included in the set, stole it from General Grievous).<br />
4) Added red, green, white and yellow navigation lights.<br />
<br />
But aside from these, it&#39;s really a cool model, for both displaying and playing. The box image doesn&#39;t really do it justice - it&#39;s much sleeker when viewed from a different angle. It&#39;s also pretty accurate, aside from the wingtip laser modifications I mentioned. The main feature, the wing folding mechanism, is brilliantly designed. However, you should probably not have the wings extended for a longer period, or I think the rubber bands will stretch out permanently and the folding won&#39;t work anymore. Just a warning...<br />
<br />

"David1971","2008-08-20T17:40:17.03Z","One of the best ever Lego sets","This is an extremely nice set, and generously done with five minifigs (six if you count R2D2). It's rather unusual that all these minifigs (including a lovely Leia in Hoth snow planet gear, Han Solo and Chewbacca) would be included even though there is no place for them in the vehicle.

The X-Wing is outstanding; so well designed, and very nicely done with lots of fine detail. The construction is modular -- you make the centre chunk, then the wings, then the pointy front part, and these chunks go together to make the whole. This works well and they are solidly connected.

If I was going to be negative, I note that compared to 'traditional' Lego sets this is almost *too* complex, a bit like building an Airfix model kit. But that's not fair really ... this is very good and it is clear they have put so much thought into the clever and attractive design.

MINIFIGS 9.5/10
Wedge-One of my favorite characters, I was disappointed when I saw his face (Hey look! My pilot friends are dead!). Its not too bad,though, and his helmet is great.
Leia- Since she and Han wear hoth clothes, I also got this set to go with the hoth base.
Han- My favorite guy! I sorta wish he had a more serious face though.
Luke- Hmm... I have two of him.
Chewie- Nice, he looks like a real wookiee.
NO ONE IS ARMED BUT LUKE!!
FIGHTER 9/10
The design is great. to people who keep complaining about the color, they were white, but had &quot;battle damage&quot;. It is nice and easy to hold. Very swooshable. The flaws are the landing gear, the short guns, and the nose. 

FEATURES 10/10
A feature I discovered while building is that if you turn a gear on the back the wings open up, just like in the movie. Another is the R2 socket, the ability to customize it to Red Five or Red Three. 

Now the pros and cons!

Pros:
Wedge
Han
All the minifigs
design is great
sleek
Did I mention the minifigs?
swooshable
S-Foil Wings
Nice scale

Cons:
Wedge's face is a smiley
The landing gear
Guns are too short
I wish it came with Biggs

Overall 9.5/10
This is a great set for dogfights, and I am proud to say that I own it. 
GET IT IF:
You like the X-Wing
You want to add Crew to the Echo base (Then sell Luke)
You want the X-wing but not yoda's hut
You want a cheaper way to get Hoth Han and Leia
You want to make a hangar
PASS IT UP IF:
You just want a Rebel fighter (go for the Y-Wing)
You're short on cash
You just want Wedge (Buy him on ebay)
You can't find it for under $65

An Empire Strikes Back model of the fighter on Hoth (not quite at the swamp yet) boasts great features which include the S-Foils that open and close with a knob twist, a storage spot and 6 minifigures.

Building the set is easy, takes about 2-3 hours and only has a couple technic sections and four rubber bands for the S-Foils. The only unstable part of the ship are the bottom engines, but it's fairly rare if they fall off at all. Finally Wedge is in a set (after not being included with the first ever X-wing with Biggs which was a mistake) and his pilot helmet looks great, and the face is fine. One of the real problems though was why couldn't Wedge come with his own astromech, R5-G8? R2-D2 can't fly everyone around!

"Zacherano","2010-02-07T21:01:03.513Z","Phenomenal Set Design and Great Minifigures As Well","     I received this set as a generous holiday gift over a year ago, yet I still enjoy tinkering with this quintessential Lego Star War masterpiece, which is truly a wonderful buy for any Star Wars OR Lego fan! After expanding my Lego Star Wars collection with the Death Star, I could not resist requesting this beauty, the classic Star Wars fighter (it does look great on display alongside the Death Star and other classic Star Wars sets). I was immediately more than satisfied with the set after I completed building, which took me maybe an hour to an hour and a half.

Starting with the design of the X-Wing itself, almost no noticeable cons come to mind in the construction and functionality!  First of all, although the wings may be tedious to build and attach to the ship, they are well worth it once you have completed them, as one is easily able to turn the gear to expand and contract the wings for take-off.  This feature is simply a genius maneuver for Lego, part of the reason why this is definitely one of my favorite Lego sets of all time (although perhaps it is a little expensive and the build is slightly long).

The other features of the X-Wing build are simply phenomenal. Once one factors in the space for R2-D2, the cargo hold, and the landing gear which works incredibly well, this is an unforgettable build, and I love the accurate and detailed appearance of the set as well! I think this is really a must-have for any Star Wars fan, and if one has been collecting Lego for a while, this is the set for you.

If you have managed to progress this far in my review, I have to rave about the classic minifigures. In addition to an exclusive Wedge Antilles minifig and a rare Luke Skywalker pilot minifig, this set includes R2-D2 and Chewbacca, as well as rare and exclusive Hoth-oriented versions of both Han Solo (new torso with blue coat and gear), and Princess Leia (winter jacket and insignia), and of course Leia's hairpiece is one of the most valuable and interesting pieces in the set.. Including the extra minifigures, this set is almost worth the price!

Overall, I find it challenging to think beyond the utter streamlined design and beauty of this set, so I deplore you to ignore any reviews that state entirely otherwise. Although there are some minor cons, I highly recommend the X-Wing. Don't forget that this memorable ship destroyed the first Death Star, partly because of its innovative design!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

PRO's - Design, opening hatch for cockpit, compartment for R2-D2, front retractable landing gear, alternate wing details to identify either Luke Skywalker or Wedge Antilles, hatch/compartment underneath to hold a lightsaber and any other hand weapon (I'd say you could hold 2-3 guns w/the lightsaber), hatch to the rear that opens to see a moving gear when you open and close the X-Wings...and finally the best 'pro' on this set...a wheel/gear in the back that cleaverly opens and closes the wings. Looks great in the X-Wing position. Also you get 5 mini-figures(Luke, Wedge, Leia, Han and Chewbacca). 

CON's - Not much, but it would've been nice to have guns for all the mini-figures. Only weapon is Luke's lightsaber. Also, there are 4 small lights to the front of wings. They can fall off. Wish it had a tighter bond, but all the con's are small quibbles. This is a great model. An excellent addition to any Lego collection and lot's of fun to play with! Highly Recommended.

I guess I'm not one to just display Lego's, and only buy what I can somehow incorporate into the town. But&nbsp;once I learned that Lego will be discontinuing the Star Wars line, I decided now would be the time to get at least some&nbsp;of my favorites from the classic trilogy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;bought the X-Wing&nbsp;from Toys R Us, paying about $10 more than I would have had I gone to the Mall Of America&nbsp;Lego store, but these are getting harder to find on the shelf.&nbsp;I couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic, buying a Star Wars toy many&nbsp;years after collecting the action figures in the late 70's/early 80's.&nbsp;I was a bit surprised that a 350+ piece set would take me over an hour to build, but the first 20 minutes assembling the core of the ship was almost like putting together a Technic set. The gearbox on the inside was cool to put together, and sometimes shake my head in amazement how Lego finds these ways to get things to work.&nbsp;The wings, or course, were repetitive,&nbsp;having 4 of them to assemble. But attaching them to the core was a snap. I found it ingenious of Lego to include small rubber bands to help raise/lower the wings once assembled.</p>
<p>It sure&nbsp;is fun to look at.&nbsp;And although I haven't gone&nbsp;running&nbsp;around the house with it or anything, none of the pieces are loose or jiggly.&nbsp;Luke, R2 and Wedge are the minifigs that best suit this set, with Han, Leia and Chewie being included as toss-ins for&nbsp;price justification.&nbsp;It's not the biggest ship out there, but definitely one of the coolest in the Star Wars&nbsp;saga as well as one of the best Star Wars Lego&nbsp;sets.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,3

I was lucky enough to get a set earlier this year in Toy R Us at a decent price. I was overjoyed.

"PaulTR","2011-06-02T13:08:06.55Z","The Best X-wing (So Far:)","<p>Many people (including myself) are guilty of&nbsp;moaning and whining when LEGO remakes the same sets over and over; while it's good to see TLG undoing their past mistakes, there comes a time when it becomes monotonous.&nbsp;However, I can safely say,&nbsp;the 6212&nbsp;X-wing Fighter is one of the best Star Wars remakes I've ever seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its&nbsp;very well-defined color scheme, attention to SW canon, and proper proportions,&nbsp;the&nbsp;6212 is easily the most accurate looking X-wing&nbsp;set to date. I am very&nbsp;pleased the designers chucked the&nbsp;ugly grey color scheme for a much cleaner approach;&nbsp;the&nbsp;whiteness, along with the&nbsp;Republic&nbsp;Red and liberal use of red parts,&nbsp;makes the set pop out and gives it an ""epic"" look.&nbsp;Also, unlike some sets, the X-wing is perfectly proportioned for minifigs. In the past, there were complaints&nbsp;that previos X-wing versions sported too-short wings. Not so here! The wings are perfectly&nbsp;canon, and&nbsp;they look simply beastly when locked in ""Attack"" position.&nbsp;The only downside I can think of as far as looks go&nbsp;is the lasers: The dome-shaped pieces aren't all that accurate. Still, that is a very minor problem in an other-wise&nbsp;gorgeous looking set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 6212 was a&nbsp;fascinating build.&nbsp;The way the wings are designed to open is ingenius and very creative: A knob on the back controls a gearbox, which in turn cranks two Technic pieces inside the wings to open them. The entire process is&nbsp;kept under&nbsp;steady pressure by rubber bands, which also&nbsp;allow the wings to close. The body of the X-wing is also cleverly designed in an arrow-like&nbsp;shape by using hinge joints to form a point; it is then sturdily attached to the gearbox section.&nbsp;As far as pieces go, the set sports nice amounts of white sloped pieces, useful cockpit/cargo pieces, and&nbsp;some really&nbsp;terrific minifigs. The targeting computer makes a re-appearence in this set (which is a&nbsp;good thing) and you get extra pieces to customize the set to your liking. However, while the pieces are cool, there's really nothing new, so I'd rate the parts as&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;good, but not blow-your-mind good.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Wedge fig is dissapointing considering he was marketed as a ""first ever LEGO minifigure"". He's just a standard smiley ""fleshie"" face in Luke's flight suit. Bummer.&nbsp;Also, the absence of C-3P0 is odd;&nbsp;it would have&nbsp;made sense if he was included, as the original cast is pretty much all included, except for him. But hey! That's just me.&nbsp;Overall, the build is very creative and unique, and the useful figs and white parts should come in handy for MOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 6212 is also a joy and pleasure to play with. The wings can be set, the cockpit opens to reveal a targeting computer, R-2 can be removed&nbsp;from his jack, the cargo compartment hinges, and the landing gear folds down. The set also has some fantastic ""swooshability"", and you can&nbsp;have some&nbsp;great dogfights with the&nbsp;TIE Interceptor set.&nbsp;As for sturdieness, not to fear! This set is solidly built, and will hold up to frequent use,&nbsp;although the cannons may fall&nbsp;off if you get too&nbsp;rough with it (but why would you do that, you LEGO-abuser!? :) The X-wing sports some&nbsp;great figs: Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie,&nbsp;R2, and Wedge.&nbsp;This set is an easy way to pick up most of the essential Original Trilogy characters in their Hoth suits, although I would have prefered the figs&nbsp;in ""Episode 4"" garb (Tatooine outfit, flight jacket, Aldaraan robes, ect.) Still, it cannot be denied&nbsp;the set is loaded with figs, and you won't be disapointed! As far as value goes, the $50 MSRP may seem a bit too much when you consider the set sports only 437 pieces. However, this point is muted when you see all the&nbsp;rare figs (minus Wedge) you get; it really does make the set worth it.&nbsp;Well, let me finish up with a list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Extremely accurate and proportional 
<li>-Unique build with very useful parts 
<li>-Plenty of action features, like opening hatches, wings, gear, ect. 
<li>-Relatively sturdy 
<li>-Lots of rare figs

<ul>
<li>-Not many ""crazy awesome"" pieces 
<li>-Wedge fig a bummer 
<li>-Cannons a bit inaccurate 
<li>-Where's the droid I'm looking for!?</li></ul>

I highly recommend this set.<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
"psychman7","2013-05-01T22:41:09.897Z","Star Wars Set #4: 6212 X-wing Fighter","I got this set for Christmas in 2007 along with #7655 Clone Troopers Battle Pack, #6205 V-wing Fighter, and #7658 Y-wing Fighter. This is a pretty good rendition of the X-wing starfighter we all know and love.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>The box is fairly large and has a fantastic design, with what it looks like TIE fighters pursuing it. I found the instructions to be slightly repetitive in the case of the wings. But they are easy to understand and show some very nice techniques, and even divided the model into four sections (not numbered bags); the main body, the wings, and the nose. I always like it when they divide up the model like that.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>There were a good mix of parts, none of them needing stickers (seeing as none of them were included in the set). The most interesting parts of note are the cockpit piece that is used with the metallic patterns, the 2x2 tile plate with the mechanic greebles, the 2x2 slope brick with Rebel targeting computer printing, and the 1x4 tile with the Red Five markings. Other parts of note are the pieces used for the laser barrels. Overall, there is a very good mix of parts used here, and there are some very nice techniques used, especially with the nose.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>In this set, you get six minifigures; Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Han Solo, and R2-D2. Luke Skywalker is dressed in his pilot attire and has a blue lightsaber. The helmet design and torso design is good. Some back printing would have been nice, though. The shiny chrome lightsaber hilt is nice, although I do think the new silver ones are better. Some may disagree, but that's just me. Wedge Antilles is only unique to this set, and I wish they would release another version of him. I really like his helmet design. Princess Leia is dressed in her Hoth outfit. The Episode IV buns with that outfit...NOT OKAY. That's completely inaccurate to the hairdo she had in The Empire Strikes Back. Chewbacca...not much to say about him. He's the same Chewie that has survived over the years. Han Solo is also dressed in Hoth attire. The torso is well-done, and he looks good, but his character should have included a blaster of something. R2-D2 is just the same one that has been there from the beginning of the Star Wars line. I prefer the newer one, but it's always good to have the classic.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The X-wing:</b></div><div>I like the design of the ship very much. I don't find it nearly as attractive as #9493 X-wing Starfighter from 2012, but it's good. It's the same design as the ship from #4502 X-wing Fighter, with some slight color alterations. But like #4502, it is slightly technicolor, which I don't recall in the actual ship. But the part that #4502 nailed that #6212 did not is the color of the sensory nose. The color in #4502 was a light gray, which is the correct color. #6212 has a white color, which isn't completely right at all. Another thing that bothers me is the length of the laser cannons. They are far too short! The tips don't even look right! The engines in this ship also are way too brick-y. They had the right idea, but they aren't smack in the center of the engine, they are slightly offset. Those are really the biggest flaws, but other than that, the ship looks totally great! The landing gear in the nose is the right height, and the retractable cargo bay is really neat. The main feature, of course, are the S-foil wings. There's a knob at the back that you have to turn in order to open up the wings. That's always a fun feature to have in any version of the X-wing. The original you had to do that manually, of course, but the gear system works so much better.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Very interesting parts and MANY printed pieces.</div><div>Minifigures - 9/10 - Gotta dock that one point for the wrong hairstyle for Princess Leia.</div><div>X-wing - 8/10 - A very well-designed ship, but some movie-accuracy issues I couldn't ignore.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 9/10. Very much well-done, six minifigures, and lots of printed pieces.</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
