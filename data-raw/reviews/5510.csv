"Monty","2006-08-16T03:47:10Z","Jumbo Jet","This set makes up into an extremely large model, which cannot fail to impress – just for its sheer size. In that respect, the box seems quite small and bland (tear at back corners again!). I suspect if this set was not a SAH exclusive it would be in a larger more attractive box – possibly with a lift up flap, but probably also a matching increase in price, so I am not complaining.

The main building work is in producing the fuselage. This involves the repetitive application of similar bricks and plates to build up the shape as well as the Boeing house colours.  In this respect the build can become a little tedious – especially when you are down to 1 x 1 plates for filling the gaps between the windows. I couldn’t wait to get past this onto the next part of the build – contouring the front and rear. The tail horizontal stabilisers are cleverly made (hinged) and fitted, but there is no dihedral. The vertical fin looks really good – especially when you add the necessary stickers either side to give the large 787 numbers and straighten the leading edge white/blue contrast. There are 4 other stickers one for “Boeing” and one for “Dreamliner” on each side. 

The nose assembly is quite good and as the “face” of the aircraft does seem to capture the classic Boeing contours. However, most of my die cast and “buy on the aircraft” type plastic airliner models feature cockpit windows painted in dark grey – for a good reason I assumed. I thought that the clear cockpit window bricks did not work well here, as there was not enough contrast with the surrounding white. In my opinion, substitution with dark grey bricks (some different) and a little tweaking of the surrounding white bricks to re-contour the area, produces much better authentic looking cockpit windows.

Once the fuselage/tail assembly is complete you get a UCS type stand to make complete with “card” sticker giving the info on the real thing. The sheer size and weight of the finished thing make you wonder if the stand will ever take it, but so far so good.

Once you are this far it seems like there are insufficient parts left, but the wings grow rapidly from just a few plates. The engines are made up from curved parts and have a big wheel for their fronts – inside which is a fan blade brick that I have not seen before. These look really good and attach to the wings with a cross axle and angled connector hidden beneath tiles to look like pylons.

The wings themselves are attached to the fuselage by way of cross axles and angled connectors and a slot in the side of the fuselage. This is quite sturdy, but causes a problem. Due to the span of the wings and the weight of the engines, they do droop to give an anhedral rather than the dihedral angle that there should be in reality. This is really only obvious when viewed from the front. 

At 50 GBP I thought the set was extremely good value for money. The only real criticism is the wing droop, but I cannot see how it can be avoided given the construction technique, and effect of gravity on such a large Lego structure. This is more than compensated for by the “wow factor” at the overall size and appearance of the model - the tedious part of the build also was forgotten by the end. It has to rate a maximum score.

Pros:
Massive!
Very detailed!
Lots of stickers!
I like the display card the best.

Cons:
Fragile
Wings fall off easily

I'd give this a 99.99%/100%!

"shnake","2009-06-24T07:49:22.483Z","So good I bought two!!","I bought the first one from Target for a hefty discount as it had been built, displayed then pulled apart and it had no instructions.
I had a great time building it and everybody who saw it commented on how good it looked, even my wife who deosn't understand while I still play with Lego ;0).
I bought the second set brand new with the intention of making an Airbus A380 out ot the two kits, and have built about 95% of this. The biggest problem i have is with the weight of the wings, and I am currently trying to solve this problem without glue!!

Pro's - Lots of cool parts.
          The engines look great
          Nice stand to rest it on for display
          Not overly complex but still has enough steps to keep it interesting.

Con's - The wings are very fragile..",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>First Impressions:</p>

<p>I received&nbsp;this model earlier today and I was VERY excited to open the package. It was very heavy. I opened it up and assembled the model. When building it, I found that it&nbsp;was very challenging and fragile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the model was complete, it put it on the stand (which was very delicate due to the sheer weight and mass of the model) and viewed it. The model is two feet, two inches (66cm) long and two feet, three inches (69cm) wide. I still can&#39;t think of anywhere to put this massive model!</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Very large, detailed model.</li>
	<li>The fuselage fits together solidly and is very strong.</li>
	<li>The wings are very detailed.</li>
	<li>The engines are very detailed. Especially impressed with those.</li>
	<li>The raked back wings are true to the real aircraft.</li>
	<li>The angle of the stand can be adjusted.</li>
	<li>The paint scheme is true to the first flight livery.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Wings and engines are prone to fall of easily.</li>
	<li>The box (2006-2007 version) is fragile and rips if you&#39;re not careful opening.</li>
	<li>No landing gear on the bottom of the model.</li>
	<li>The front windows aren&#39;t very accurate, mainly because the aircraft took its first flight three years after the set was released. This is also when the set was discontinued.</li>
	<li>Stickers cover multiple bricks and tear easily. Thankfully, replacement&nbsp;stickers are very cheap from eBay.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>This grand set stands up today, 9 years after its release. However, the set is rather innacurate, due to the fact that the set was designed three years before the Boeing 787-8 took its first flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, this set is very large. It is a model and is not designed as a toy to be played with. The wings are delicate but do stay on most of the time.&nbsp;</p>
