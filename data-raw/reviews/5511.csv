Most likely you already have this because most people buy a complete NXT set, but people who buy only NXT-special pieces like this don't so they need one. It has a nice name, Interactive Servo Motor and the name alone can impress anyone you are talking to about it with. (Haha)

Simply, it's a hideous result of some deranged engineers that have been lokked up for far too long!<br><br>The Motor it's self mechanically is excellent. But, the problem arrives as soon as you attempt to fit it in/around your Robot. Most of us want to build more than ""ALPHA REX"" with our Mindstorms NXT Kit.<br><br>LEGO would have been far better of using PowerFunction type Motors with Encoders.<br>I often use PowerFunction Motors in place of NXT Motors where motor position feedback isn't required. Also PowerFunction Motors can be used with a RCX Type Rotation Sensor if needed.<br><br>Besides the Sound Sensor in the NXT v1.0 kit and the NXT Motors, the LEGO Mindstorms NXT Kit is an amazing platform which I highly recommend..<br><br>www.rjmcnamara.com for my LEGO Mindstorms NXT Bots.<br>",TRUE,3,5,1,3,4
