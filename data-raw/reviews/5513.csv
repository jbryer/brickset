The brain brick here will do what you want it to do, provided you have the Servo Motors and the sensors to execute a command. There are many ports here to insert the connect cables. Instead of having LEGO studs on the surface like the previous Mindstorms RCX did, this one prioritizes Technic parts, thus having Technic connector pin slots all around it. The brain brick has a monochrome display which allows you to see many stuff and also show what you want to display in there, such as a smiley face.
