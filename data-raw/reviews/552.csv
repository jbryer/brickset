"James83","2013-01-05T06:59:20.637Z","Winter Buggy","<p>The release of Set 6652 Rocky River Retreat began a series of adventure vaction sets and this was one of the smallest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p><p>A snow scooter which cleverly used the new Ice Planet skis and chainsaws to form the basic chassis. It was nice to have a land vehicle that didn't rely on wheels for a change! This is a very quick build but the driver has a seat, steering wheel and a small windscreen. There are headlights too. The way the skis and chainsaws attach look good too. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p><p>This guy has blue jeans legs, brown bomber jacket body, blue shades and stuble head and a blue cap. He also comes with a hand-held radio, a useful safety device when his alone in the mountains, but since he has to always carry it and drive with one hand an accident is probably more likely!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p><p>This set is one of those small vehicles that you easily overlook or forget but its well designed despite the basic construction and is something different. If you don't have any other outdoors adventure sets then it might not fit in (although replace the skis and chains for orange ones and the red bricks for blue and you have an Ice Planet vehicle instead!) but it is a good set to own if you do.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,4
