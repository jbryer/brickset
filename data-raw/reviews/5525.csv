The capes are not neccesary, and i removed them and placed the red capes on my Red clone troopers from the clones battle pack and the blue capes can be used as ARC trooper capes for your SW clones.  Great set, and really nice minifigs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It also is good for chess. you can take off the heads of the pawns, kings, queens, bishops, etc. so It's more customizable. Half has spears, while the others have axes. Quite good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
