","I don't think that people should buy this because it has bad graphics, a kind of blurry screen, and the new Wii version of both of the Star Wars games is much better. The game has too few characters. On the other hand, if you were to choose between this and the first Lego Star Wars game, I would recommend this more than the first.    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is all blurry and it is even hard to shoot stright! The screen keeps moving and it is hard to see anything and I don't even understand the plot of the game!  It is a REALLY bad game for the Game boy Advance, but for other systems it is REALLY good!  Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoyed it!

"Leggodt94","2008-07-07T20:50:55.857Z","Well, at least it's better than the first one","Another diappointment from the Game Boy version. You know, I don't know why I even tolerate it. Anyways, this game is better than the first one, but it still has a lot of flaws: 

Cons: 
-vehicle rounds are difficult 
-the graphics and camera angle are bad just like the first one 
-you can't mix and match 
-only leia can super charge her gun 
-rounds aren't as fun 
 
Pros: 
-you start out in the cantina 
-more characters 
-actual extras 
-you get minikits 
-includes exclusive baby rancor playable character 

Yes, this game may have a lot of pros, but the cons are much worse. My suggestion to you is to go with another system. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"icemon300","2011-04-29T22:44:13.25Z","Fun... If You Get All The Mininkits...","This was my first LEGO game. I beat it, getting all Minikits and Full Studs everywhere, but it took forever. However, once I did, i got a character that made it (almost) worth it... a Rancor. That's right. You can play as a Rancor! It takes <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">7</span> electrical shocks from the Emperor to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">get him down by one heart!</span> Other than that, this game is difficult, frustrating, and just plain annoying (characters you play in story mode have to be bought!) I did find, however, a glitch which can be used to ""upgrade"" characters... use Leia in the Emperor's level, charge your gun, and let him shock you... you get a permanent charging effect, that lasts even when switching characters, greatly upgrading them. If you enjoy a (very) frustrating challenge, you might want to try this. Otherwise, don't. <br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,4
