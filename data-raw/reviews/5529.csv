"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-03-16T11:12:07.543Z","Yeah, it's not as clean as the platformers, but that shouldn't stop you","I bought LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy for the fair sum of $19.99 last summer. I was expected dumbed down levels of my GameCube game fit for a handheld system, but I was wrong. The DS version offers levels not seen in the platform editions, as well as a free roaming (not restricted to just one screen) multiplayer, and various characters not in the platform game (Biggs Darklighter, for example). However, the game is filled with glitches in many levels, and to complete the game easily I recommend researching a guide on the Internet to help with getting and finding the minikits. There's also a special multiplayer bounty hunter game where you and up to 4 try to capture Han Solo in Carbonite, or just scoring the most kills. It's not perfect, but LEGO Star Wars for DS is a pretty good changeover from the platformers, but the glitches takes the score down a bit, plus the cutscenes are a bit more ""random"".",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The Graphics (although still pretty poor) are better than the original Lego Star Wars on the Gameboy Advance, and the levels are more accurate to the PS2 version. The game was fine right through story mode, with only a few minor glitches, but once i started playing free play, I started noticing a large amount of glitches and bugs that made some levels incompletable.
Some examples of these bugs are: The ""camera"" being stuck behind a wall, so you cannot see where you are going, and endless loop of dying and respawning, falling down a hole, and (instead of respwning) walking around inside the hole.
There are many others.
The creators of the game also made a Sandbox level, where (apparently) all your unlocked characters are supposed to fight each other, but instead it is a desert where nothing happens, and nothing is in it.
So overall, do not buy this game, buy Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga on DS  Instead, as it is 100 times better",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
