"Gus_263","2008-05-15T10:37:38.077Z","A classic small space","This set was released in 1994, and still useful with basic contents, some that makes structures for many lego buildings. This have a minifigure with things used on all this subtheme. The building of the set is from a basic plane, that can be used too to increase on great buildings, like in spaceships. This set altough small, if compared with small sets, is a classic and is rare now. The subtheme had humans exploring a planet, altough without aliens, don't had problems, because the buildings were different, no only for mining or other things. Some contents are the jets on the sides and too another type of one (also used on other sets as a gun), very useful due to be used on old sets. And too plates to keeps the set and makes it's building more solid. Is easy put the minifigure on the set and play with this. The control panel can also moves and is located at the front of the minifigure. This is good positioned on a plate with a shape made specially to the minifigure, and keeps the set playable. A ramp piece (in the blue color) is placed on the back of the minifigure and can be used as a seat for this or for other sets. Colors too used on this subtheme makes the contents more useful, like the glowing orange on the minifigure's itens and the white and blue (or also few black) pieces, that makes this set looks like with an environment of ice (because the environment of the subtheme is in ice). This altough small, with few contents, have useful ones, and the playability is the same thing of small sets. Comparing with small sets, this is a classic from the space (also because the minifigure of the set is in the original shape). Overall, this is a 5/5 set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"James83","2017-08-18T13:40:58.44Z","Icy Scooter","<p>Of all the Space sub-themes, my favorite&nbsp;was Ice Planet. It was such a nice combination of land and space vehicles, the perfect icy blue-white colour combination and nice touches like the slit visors and ice saws.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a simple build but it looks good and has a reasonable parts count for a pocket money set. The craft is sturdy and well designed, even having two clips to stow the hand-held gear which many smaller space vehicles lacked. The control panel can be tilted on a hinge brick and the pilot gets a 4x4 sloped brick backrest with a vent brick on top. The craft has two jet/rocket engines.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>A standard Ice Planet figure with a printed white-haired male head, a helmet with&nbsp;the cool orange slit visor with radio antenna and white airtanks. He comes fully equipped with a loudhailer/laser and an ice saw.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>This little craft was perfect for scouting missions and didn&#39;t really need any additional features. Later I added a spare Ice Planet printed sloped brick on the nose from a decorated elements service pack. It formed a key part of my Ice Planet fleet. This is nice little set.</p>

"brokenhaiku","2020-05-20T19:05:57.71Z","Cool little set","<p>Let&#39;s face it: Ice Planet is one of the best Space themes in Lego. The Neon orange colors mixed with white/black/blue look astonishing</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This super cheap set brings a minifig, the amazing neon trans orange saw and a megaphone/gun/wtvr</p>

<p>For the price it looks cute and like a miniature version of the one the comes inside Deep Freeze Defender</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Totally worth it</p>
