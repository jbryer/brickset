It follos the stroy well an the cutscenes and levels have little tidbits of humor sewn into the environment(and cutscenes). The only complaints that i have are the fact that you can't skip the cutscenes even if you have already seen them, and the undefeated achievments seem to be a waste of time, especially in the vehicle levels. But all in all the addition of being able to &quot;build&quot; things inside the game and other tweaks makes this game a must have for fans of the first Lego Star Wars game.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
