I am more familiar with the original trilogy so when LEGO Star Wars I was released I was upset it was based on the 2nd Trilogy (I, II and III). When I found out that this game was made, I couldn't wait to play it. It doesn't disappoint. The cut scenes are spectacular and you feel as if you were watching a Star Wars movie made from LEGO. The vehicles you can control are a lot of fun and you can even customize a minifig character to play as. As with the Star Wars films, the music is great as is the story line. I love this game and can't wait for the LEGO Batman license to get the same treatment. At 20 bucks you can't go wrong...unless you buy the Complete Trilogy that combines both games 1 and 2 into 1 game with added levels, features and characters. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
X-Treme lightsaber actions by Master Yoda and Darth Sidious
Nicely designed Mos Eisley Spaceport
Excellent graphic and sound
Very close with the film in songs (for example you will find the same music played inside Mos Eisley both in the game and in the film)
Funny Chewbacca

What's better about this one is the fact that it has more things to find in order to unlock more special features along with creating the same mini vehicles outside (which are cool to look at). I absolutely love how there is a lot more hours put into the game by the player and the idea of having to find more in order to get more. Get this game!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-15T16:04:08.67Z","The Force will be With You, Always...","<p>LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy: This sequel to the first LEGO Star Wars game proved that LEGO Adventure Titles of this caliber had the staying power to create something vivid and intense. It also proved that combining LEGO and Star Wars together could be both humorous, ingenious and one of the better things of this new millennium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new features introduced in this game allowed you to create fun and quirky Mini-Figure characters for Free Play mode. They introduced the Mini-Kit Vehicle stages in which you got to actually use your Mini-Kits for something. The Bounty Hunter style missions, track down the characters wanted by Jabba the Hutt. Attain True Jeid status in both Story Mode and Free Play mode, something the original didn't have. Much better Vehicle stages with free roaming (to an extent) and larger arenas to play in that weren't simply on rails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many new fun Red Brick powers/Extras and of course the play through the entire Episode in one sitting to achieve the high score. The stages were slightly longer too if I recall and they offered up many more opportunities to build and interact with the LEGO Star Wars Universe. If not for LEGO Star Wars II's improvements I fear we wouldn't have gotten the great games that followed (LEGO Batman/LEGO Harry Potter/LEGO Indiana Jones) nor would we have even wanted them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucasfilm, LEGO and Traveler's Tales have done something that has been tried before, but not always succeeded, they made great video games that were fun for the whole family. You could play along with your children and enjoy the video game experience alongside of them, helping them out with trickier puzzle like situations or even just letting you watch along as your kids discovered something new and exciting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I'd have to say that without LEGO Star Wars II the LEGO Video Game Franchise would be an entirely different creature and who knows what that creature might look like? The improvements to the overall feel and design of the game proved something. It proved that you could enjoy a great LEGO based game no matter what your age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by now I think I'm just repeating myself. I'd have to say that if you don't already own this game and are looking for a shorter adventure as opposed to LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga for your children to sink their teeth into and start out with the LEGO Video Game franchise, I think this one is suitable for them. And in case you're wondering why I only rate the parts and building experience as one for these games, well the site doesn't give you an option to rate them as zero since they really don't apply for Video Games.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"jedi_master_kit_fisto","2011-01-25T15:37:29.347Z","excellent","<p>it is a good game to play with because it has good levels and you can play as all the characters on episodes, 4 , 5 and 6. It's sort of real because you can drive and fly through space. you can build lots of things like buildings, ships, vehicles and tanks so overall it is a fun game to play!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"A_Brickset_user","2018-09-17T15:12:16.36Z","LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy ","<p>If you are a fan of LEGO or Star Wars in general, then this is the game for you. This is a game I love to play, it is an amazing game to own.&nbsp;</p>
