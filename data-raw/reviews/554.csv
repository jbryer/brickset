"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-11T20:37:31Z","Small set with extra weapons","I really liked this set.  It was very in-expensive, I believe I bought mine in a baggie rather than a box.  Anyways, it is a good way to get a few extra crossbows and it was my only black spear for a while (I really liked that).  Overall, the model is a little lacking, but this is a good small set with a good selection of weapons.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-21T17:10:05.7Z","Another crossbow cart","This another castle carts, with the castle theme's wheels, useful, but for only castle. This is also another set with crossbows, and another weapons, like the spear, sword and a shield, that can be putted in the minifigure too. The minifigure is also a classiic included in the dragon knights series. It is useful, i rate it 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2009-04-16T07:59:51.733Z","Here's your army builder!","Most larger Dragon Knight sets (except for 6082) have as much or even more 'knights' (the ones with the dragon plume helmets) than 'soldiers' (like the one in this set). I think that's pretty weird, so this set comes as a relief: buy a few of them et voil√°, you have a soldier army. 
Complete with more than enough weapons (especially the shield is very welcome) and some parts for making a small chariot or something.

As a set I wouldn't really recommend it, but as an army builder it's invaluable!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
