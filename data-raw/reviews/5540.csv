"lego12","2008-05-12T16:49:08.747Z"," This watch is pretty unique!"," I gave this watch a 5 or a 10/10 because there is nothing wrong with it. It is a nice watch that you can design and choose a pattern of your choice! It is overpriced, but I got it on sale at a Lego store for $8.00. Is just a watch so there's not much to say..........well, I hope you enjoyed the review!
