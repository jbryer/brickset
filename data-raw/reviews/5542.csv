"Galaxy12_Import","2018-04-27T03:51:54.587Z","The Birth of the Board Game Concept?","<p>LEGO board games had a solid run back around the turn of 2010, but before they settled into the classic character-driven board style&nbsp;or even the well-executed&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/3844-1/Creationary"" target=""_self"">Creationary</a>&nbsp;we got to see this&nbsp;attempt&nbsp;at the LEGO adaptation of a tabletop classic; Dominos.</p>

<p>The highlight of the brick version that tries to set the product apart is the stackability of the playing pieces as seen in marketing photos of the game. The building process is unremarkable and gets repetitive, just three bricks for each Domino that are designed to be played by matching the color instead of the traditional dot patterns. With only 28 playable dominos and limited color selection the gameplay is severely restricted compared to what Domino players are used to, and the stacking feature isn&#39;t adequate&nbsp;to counter these shortfalls.</p>

<p>As a game I give LEGO Dominos a three out of five, but in the idea we see the groundwork for the successful line of games that fully embrace the versatility&nbsp;what LEGO can do, which is much more&nbsp;than a few 2x4 bricks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
