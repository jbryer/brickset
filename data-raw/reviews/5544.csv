"MatrixQuest","2008-01-15T22:15:12.95Z","no-no tic-tac-toe","OK, I admit up front I picked this up when LS@H dropped the price.  Why?  It has five cops and five robbers.  I grabbed 2 of them at the reduced price and it didn't take me but the first glance to order.  I finally have enough criminals to keep my town in fear and enough cops to have some down at the station and others attending each emergency.  To add variety, I just swapped the heads with extras I had from other sets.  As far as the game goes, it's OK.  Tic-tac-toe with mini-figs is a bit more fun than the original, but lets face it we only play the game when all we have is pencil and paper.  My main complaint with the set as a set is that the case/box it's made into doesn't hold up well at all.  The glue between the two haves gives out and does so quickly.  I'm guessing that's the reason for the markdown.  I'm trying to figure a way to work the game boards into my town setup as part of a courtyard.  Still this set works great for building up your city's crime and punishment ranks.  I recommend this set on that point alone.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

	I purchased this set in Legoland Windsor back in 2008.<br />
	<br />
	<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Packaging</span><br />
	The background is covered in a Blue background, with black &#39;pencil-like&#39; drawings of Lego Bricks, placed on top of it. But the main focus of the packaging is the policeman chasing a robber.<br />
	It can be opened by a small Velcro patch on the side, allowing the user to open it with the bendable piece of cardboard, which itself is quite durable!<br />
	<br />
	<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Contents</span><br />
	Once opened, you will notice that there is 2 different Lego boards on both sides, both of these are glued on so you cannot take them out, which is annoying for people buying this set just for parts.<br />
	The first board is a Dark Gray 16/16 base plate, which is used to put the figures in once playing has ended, presumably for storage.<br />
	The other side is a collection of 6 White 4/4 plates with 8 Blue 1/6 tiles and 12 Blue 1/4 tiles.<br />
	<br />
	<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mini figures</span><br />
	You get a total of 10 mini figures; 5 being Police officers and the other 5 being Robbers.<br />
	There is nothing individually interesting about the figures as they are just generic City Police figures, however there are a few interesting parts; such as the Dark Gray &#39;knit cap&#39;, the Dark Gray legs, from the Robber and The Dark Gray Gloves, and his White hat from the Policeman.<br />
	<br />
	<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros</span><br />
	10 Mini figures<br />
	Rare<br />
	Strong packaging<br />
	<br />
	<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cons</span><br />
	Only 2 variants of Mini-Figures, which themselves are generic Police figures<br />
	All the Lego Plates and Tiles are glued in<br />
	No assembling in this model<br />
	<br />
	<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall:</span><br />
	Whilst playing the game is fun, it does not have any long lasting appeal as the new Lego Games series produces.<br />
	So I would recommend picking this set, if you happen to find it on clearance or at a Garage sale.<br />
	<br />
	Thank you for spending the time in reading the review, have a good day</p>
