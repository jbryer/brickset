These coasters are awesome and look great around my apartment. They are rubbery and they have studs but the studs are not LEGO sized, they are too large. The coasters measure roughly the same size as a 16x16 baseplate and come in a light blue and a red, 2 of each color.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Offer them a drink. A cup of coffee, an orange juice, anything lah, and then put the coaster on the table. It definitely will start a conversation around Lego.<br><br>I like the design of the coaster. Simple, yet very Lego. And don't think that this coaster can be used as a baseplate. They are made from rubber, so they are not sturdy, but kind of wobbly, and the size of the stud is not fit for real Lego bricks.<br><br>",TRUE,4,1,1,1,3
