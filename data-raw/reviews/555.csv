"MPH","2007-08-24T14:58:33.88Z","Hmm...","Disappointing pirate set. Sure, the minifig is good and a flag is always welcome, but the raft sucks. Total lack of creativity and just a very bad copy of 6234. Not worth getting, unless you want the minifig really badly.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-27T14:39:53.983Z","The Shipwrecked pirate","This set is a small set of the pirates theme and was released in the year of 1994. Like some other small sets of the pirates theme,this is simple but also good designed and builted. This have a minifigure of a pirate with no new features, like others, in a simple design and with the characteristics of classic lego minifigures. The pirate also have a hat, a paddle and a sword. The raft is small with some useful pieces like the flag of the pirates and is good builted. The building uses a black small plate and under are some pieces like the minifigures totally yellow heads. The playabilty is like the set, basic due to the set. Altough the set is nice, this have no features like the cannon, more minifigures and a more solid building, nothing new, but still cool. So, i rate the &quot;Shipwrecked Pirate&quot; 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-13T18:02:10.153Z","not sure","this set is ok. i got mine as a bonus with a few other sets. its preaty much a pirate with a flag,a sword, an oar, and a dinky raft. the box has and interesting sort of dock and bar on it but there not much. 

get it you want to complete the pirate series or just want a raft. you could probabilly find it with another set on ebay (like me!)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"absolutelylez","2010-01-04T16:29:51.56Z","Cheap and Cheerful","This is a cheap set, so you don't expect many bricks. It is incredibly cute, and I think it uses its brick selection well. You buy a little raft, you get a little raft! The one thing that I don't particularly like is the actual minifigure, I think they could have provided a more interesting one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SimonStickfish","2009-09-09T13:25:56.39Z","cheap copy of older set","I agree with some of the others here that the 1733 is a cheap copy of it's predecessor. It's even worse, since the poor pirate has to keep his pedal in his hands, so he can't sleep! But the guy himself is a nice addition to any pirate's army. So 2 out of 5 should be enough.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"rr211","2011-01-27T15:25:50.46Z","Good basic set","<p>This is the smallest pirate set I own and&nbsp;I acquired it along with 6581, 1732, 6670 and&nbsp;6814.</p>
<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>
<p>I do not own the box, but the instructions are easy to&nbsp;follow and are very simple. The art on the front of instructions is brilliant as with all other pirate instructions. There are&nbsp;7 steps in all and there are no adverts or set funtions pages.</p>
<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>
<p>A set this small so we cannot expect many pieces, but the peices included are very satisfactory. the interesting parts are: an oar in red, a cutless in DK grey and a pirate skull-and-crosbone flag-you can never have enough of these! Also there are 8 yellow round bricks-useful for making railings for ships</p>
<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>
<p>This set only includes one minifigure, but as this is such a small set this can be excused. The minifigure is just&nbsp;an ordanairy pirate, with a blue bandana, eye-patch face with ginger hair, a black and red striped vest and blue legs. I would have prefered a&nbsp;rarer&nbsp;minifigure, like the trader in imperial trading post, but lego did not do this at this time,&nbsp;it is ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The build</strong></p>
<p>Yet again it is a small set so you cannot espect a good build but it was satisfing and was good enough for a set of this size. There are no piece call outs, as with all sets of this era. There are no sub models, apart from the minifigure.</p>
<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>
<p>The model is a small raft with yellow floats and black decking. There is a black flagpole with a white jolly roger flying from it. An Ok mini raft. however when compared with 6234, it is very lacking. The&nbsp;poor pirate has to hold the oar instead of in 6234 where there is a holder for the oar. there are also no clips for weapons in this set as in 6234. To end up there is no shark or tricorne.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Instructions: 7/10 nice old fashioned instructions with nice pirate artwork.</p>
<p>Parts: 9/10 a good selection of pieces for a set of this size.</p>
<p>minfigure: nice generic pirate figure to add to my 40+ hoard of pirates</p>
<p>build:N/A</p>
<p>model: 6/10 ok but not as good as the rest of the pirate rafts.</p>

"mr_hazey","2011-06-06T18:08:13.897Z","Shipwrecked Pirate","<p>I was very happy today when the postman knocked on my door and it was a package for me. I have been waiting over a week for the item I won on eBay on the 29th May. That item was set 1733 which is the boxed version of 1713. The set cost me £8.06 plus £1.99 for postage and packaging. The set is called ""Shipwrecked Pirate"" and was released in 1994.</p>
<p>The item I won came with it's original box and instructions, the box was a little battered but for a box that is 17 years old it is in great condition and the instructions besides the creasing are in top condition as well. The set has all 23 pieces with it, I sat and it took me less then 5 minutes to put it together, with my daughter Molly helping me. After putting it together I inspected the set for any bad parts. The sword had been chewed by the looks of it, thankfully I have some brand new ones spare from another set, so I replaced that the craft itself was in top condition, could not find any faults with it, although not a fan of how it sites on two black discs as it seems to always want to lean to one side or the other.</p>
<p>The mini figure however was not as good as the craft, on inspection the legs had a gash on the front right leg. The right arm and hand had marks on them and the head had a line where the hat had rubbed, so will be looking at replacing the mini figure with one in better condition, as even the slightest mark or dint annoys me. Other than the mini figure it is a great little model and looks sweet with the other models (I will review them soon). Overall not a bad little set but I prefer set 6234 as it offers more and looks better IMO.</p>

"bricksan","2012-05-25T12:46:31.397Z","A poor version of Renegade's Raft","<div>I selected this model due to the comparisons it always draws with 6234 Renegade’s Raft. Below you will realize why I prefer 6234 over this one, this is not to say it’s a rubbish model but the fact is the two models are very similar so you will prefer the better one of the two.</div><div><br></div><h4>Introduction</h4><div><br></div><div>This is another set I purchased off eBay and I rather foolishly paid over the odds. The set cost me £8.06 plus P&amp;P but you can pick a decent 2nd hand one for less then that. Mine came with mint condition instructions and a box that had only been opened. When it was originally released back in 1994 it was priced at £1.99 and was one of the last sets I had before entering my dark age.</div><div><br></div><div>What is worth mentioning is there are two version of this set that are the same except that one comes in a polybag (1713) and one comes in a box (1733). &nbsp;Why TLG decided to release it twice I don’t know but as I have mentioned in the Pirates featurette it was a come practice back in the 90's.</div><div><br></div><div>The minifigure in this set was one of the new designed ones and the only one to have the red/back vest combo. This was always my favourite crewman. &nbsp;The box had the usual 3 different designs on the back and came with the purple colouring as you can see from this image. The instructions is an A6 piece of paper, the front is the cover image and the minifigure instructions and the first 3 stages of the build. The back is the final 4 stages of the build and is yet another set that does not require instructions after you have built it once.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>The set consists of 23 pieces with 5 being part of the minfig. The under side of the raft is very similar to set 6234 as &nbsp;you have the yellow barrels, unlike the previous version of this raft you only get half the amount of yellow barrels and you also get to put two black boat studs on the bottom but due to their positioning the raft either leans forward or back.</div><div><br></div><div>The build is all underneath as there is no oar holder like on the Renegade’s Raft and no extra oar or weapon. &nbsp;For the same price you get a lot less for you money, you get a whole 15 less pieces for you money. I feel like it is just a watered down version of a very good set. The extra builds that are displayed on the back are not much better, with the best being the raised platform with a plank. The other two are nothing amazing as you can tell from the images below.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>While I have it in my collection, for me it is one of my least favourite as it is not a patch on the earlier raft. Now if they had done this one first and then Renegade’s Raft after it would have been a have decent small set and we would be saying LEGO took a small set and made it a 100 times better, when in fact it is the opposite way round. The best thing about this set is the minifigure.</div><div><br></div><div>Images:http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629892588458/with/7268377524/</div><div>Review on my site: http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/1733-shipwrecked-pirate/</div>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,3
