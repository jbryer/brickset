"Flying_Dutchman","2007-03-01T05:32:35.013Z","Nice little set","Nice set with cool features. I especially like the stabilizers which lock firmly in place when in downward position. There is only one remark, the &quot;turntable&quot; is only held in place with one blue friction pin, which is not ery stable and becomes kind of saggy with &quot;heavier&quot; loads.
I don't know why, but the two models are divided between three booklets. This seemed somewhat strange for such a small model. Overall not bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-21T10:46:26.393Z","Realistic small set","For such a small set, this little crane seems to have it all.  There's the fold up ramps which prevents the crane from moving when folded out, but when retracted, it doesn't disturb the rolling motion of the crane.  The crane itself has multiple functions, being able to rotate 360 degrees, go higher or lower, telescope a small amount and lift things via a wince at the back.  There's even a little cockpit to top off the set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

At first glance it would seem small and insenifigent but it is really cool and it is a fun challange to pick up the red thing it comes with! The only con is that it can only lift small things!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Mandalorian","2010-10-29T11:46:54.417Z","Neat, but small.","I have had this set for a long time, and I must say it's cool. By turning a knob in the back you can make the arm lift, and another knob lets you control the piece of string with the hook. The whole upper part of it can rotate and you can lower stabilizers at both ends also. The arm, however you have to extend manually, which is too bad. Also, this crane is bigger than the average mini-set. <br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>cool functions</li><li>not too small</li><li>good price</li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Could do with more parts</li><li>Arm extends manually</li><li>With the B-model you can't pick up a heavy load, because it tips over easily</li></ul><br>By now, it's hard to get this model, so even do it's quite cool, if you don't have it, you probably won't be able to get it. I wouldn't get this set by ordering it online for double the price, but if you see it anywhere in a shop, buy it.<br><ul><li><br></li><li><br></li><li>&nbsp;<br></li></ul>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"tkettle9719","2011-12-28T18:35:34.42Z","Gearful Lifting","This is my first true Technic set, and think it is a truly marvelous set. It is aa very simple Technic model with many excellent uses of Technic and System combos. <br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The use of the axle slot brick and the system trapezoid piece looks really professional. <br></li><li>-The yellow also feels perfectly right.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The string is a large bother to put on. <br></li><li>-The small, noticeable black parts also feel a bit out-of-place.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is really quite good. It's everything I expected from my first Technic set, but even more. This is more difficult to build than Bionicle.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
