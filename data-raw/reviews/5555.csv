"werther","2007-02-11T12:55:56.087Z","More track links please!","In my opinion the springs are too stiff. Nice design though. There are 28 link elements (4494517)which is bare minimum to make alternative two tracks vehicle. If pushed arround, the surface driven upon must be soft to produce enough friction so the tracks are moving.
I will probably buy one more just to buld one noisy little motorised robot. It would be nice if tracks and special wheels could be bought sepparately.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sarin","2007-02-26T09:53:29.653Z","nice, but could be better","I've just came out of my lego-darkages, and after buying a couple of older 2nd-hand sets; I decided to try a more recent model to discover the changes in lego-building.
The design is quite allright, though I still have a feeling that lego really tried to save money on this one.
The steering could have been more sophisticated, and there are barely enough thread-links to make a decent alternate model.
(It would be nice if such parts are be&#239;ng sold separately).
The suspension is nice, a bit stiff..  but nice; if the &quot;wheel-connectors&quot;  
where the ski's are connected to the suspension would be suited for a car;  
then this model would be the perfect kit for extra parts.

"Flying_Dutchman","2007-03-06T05:18:37Z","Cool design","I had this set laying about for a couple of weeks now and finally found the time to sit down for it.
It was a fun build, no surprises, except maybe for the steering assembly, which looked a bit odd in the beginning, but when it was finished, it looked pretty logical and it works fine too.
I simply love the new tracks, they are a staggering 5 units wide and feel really robust. I can't wait to get more of them which will probably be when the 8275 Caterpillar comes out (I think Brickset and Lego themselves are the only sites which haven't got a picture of it yet (BOOOOOOO) ;-)
Anyhow, this snowmobile is a nice addition and looks really cool next to the 8420 Street Bike. The alternate model looks OK, but I'll still wait for the 8275.

"Exo_brick","2008-01-13T13:09:54.263Z","Yay","this set is very good for parts if you have the nxt. i got this for the treads and the suspension.

Pros:Treads,Suspension,and steering.

Cons:Too many plates covering the inner workings and the bulldozer is no good.

at least it works on snow.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pirakapro","2008-01-23T11:55:25.733Z","great!","I proudly own the technic 8272 snow mobile and it is so cool! 

 
 
pros: good instructions,
fun! and cool desine 

Cons: somtimes gets &quot;sticky stering&quot;!

overall a good set! (p.s. it is unavailible in the  U.S 
but you can get them in LEGO retail stores!)

"Wiseman_2","2008-05-09T11:31:08.14Z","Good on the shelf","This set, for the money paid, is quite good - some nice parts (well, ok, just the tracks, but they ARE good), and also, for someone who's returning to Lego after a long period away (like me), it shows some interesting build mechanisms that can be adapted to other technic models, such as the suspension/steering system.

On the shelf, this looks pretty good - it's quite big too, something I wasn't expecting.

The B-model is where this set is something of a let down - the dozer is not very well balanced (but it is well designed, considering the parts left to work with), and the front blade seems too big for it. It doesn't even look that good.

One last thing about the tracks - they can be used for other functions as well, thanks to their neat design.

So for parts and design, this set it quite good. But it just feels like it's lacking something that would put it above the rest.

"jamal_lts","2009-08-11T14:50:13.793Z","OUTCOLD!","The model is very realistic. Looks like a real snowmobile. 

The only thing its lacking is the rear suspension.. Otherwise, everything is just perfect. 

I absolutely love the steering mechanism and the treads. The treads are smooth and can run on virtually any surface. I had mine running across a smooth table and it treads as per normal.

The build is not quite simple as i have to ""swing"" beams over into place after ""preparing"" them. This happens somewhere in the rear portion of the model.

Not much playability on its own. Even with the upcoming snow groomer, it still sits alone as the scale differs.

Currently, i rigged up a tow at the back of my Extreme Off-Roader where the Snowmobile sits on nicely, waiting to be ""transported"" for Xtreme actions!

"Starstreak","2009-08-11T05:50:19.827Z","Solid build.  Lots of neat parts like shocks and treads.","I did a full review with photos here:
http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=26803&hl=

(B4 saying this review wasn't helpful, read the full review)

Here is the closing for that review:

Issues
No big issues for this build. Everything snapped together without any problems. Some Technic builds are a bit hard to join due to how some parts need to have a tighter fit. I didn’t come across anything that would be too hard for the average 9 year old to adult to push together. There is a tubing that you need to cut to size. And while not a issue per say, the springs on the shocks is really hard, so don't expect allot of ""bounce"".

Final thoughts

I bought it for parts, but after playing with it, I almost don’t want to take it apart. It really looks like a snowmobile! But I wanted the shocks/springs and the treads. Not many sets had treads in it. Sorry, I don't know where the sticker sheet went.  

My rating:

Playability: 4 out of 5. It’s swooshable, although theres no figure for it.
Design: 5 out of 5. Solid unit. And it really looks like a snowmobile. 
Build experience: 2 out of 5. On a Technic scale, this was easy. And nothing falls off when I push it around on the floor.
Overall: 4 out of 5. It’s not expensive when the set was released and I like the parts that came with it.

"Hylocera","2010-04-15T00:18:02.717Z","Awesome Snowmobile","<p>&nbsp;I got this set at Toys&nbsp;R Us for $29.99 (Actually my brother did), and what an awesome deal that was! I mean, this thing has a large amount of pieces, very few stickers (Technic sets somehow stay cool-looking without them),&nbsp;and suspension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also, this thing is indestructible!&nbsp;We dropped this thing from the second floor of our house around five times before it broke, and then only the track came off. So, if you're looking for a set that can be tossed around in your room, buy this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also has working steering, for wheels this seems easy, but wait until you see how they did it for the skis!</p>
<p>The alternate model is nice too, a bulldozer with working blade/ripper functions. But one problem: How do you bulldoze with a big hole in the middle of the blade?</p>
