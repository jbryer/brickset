You get a nice fireman minifigure with a silver helmet, and there are more than enough accessories for him as well. The vehicle itself is nicely done, and although the wheels do stick out a little, this doesn't detract majorly from the set to me.

"legoguysw","2008-09-10T14:50:59.623Z","2007? Not a bad year for city, and this ain't a bad set!","As have written above, 2007 was good year for City, and this set was one of it's better sets.
This set is, looking back at it, pretty good.
There is 1 fig with this set, a fire fighter, with all the usual equipment. He has the same face with silver glasses that has been very overdone in city sets recently.
Although the truck is 4 studs wide, the wheels stick out 6 studs wide (I dont mean the tyres are both 6 studs wide!)This really makes the set look rubbish, so avoid this set if you are not a City fan and would only buy it cause it looks nice. But, I heard there’s a modification kit for this in Lego Factory, though I can't find it, but you can always modify it at home or make something on LDD(Lego digital designer). It can’t be that hard to fix. And it does give it that cool off-road look, so it doesn’t worry me enough to modify it.
Anyway, the truck has a seat for the driver, though it is a bit high for the windscreen, this was because Lego decided to put a 2X2 plate under the seat. This may seem pointless, but its so the bit that sticks out of the back of the fire fighters helmet can fit in the cab.
Behind the drivers seat section is a place you can store the equipment thing. The tiles on which this lays, two 4X2 grey ones, have some ‘metal’ stickers, that make it look like that metal with those X shaped marks in it. Very realistic, but they’re STICKERS! Now, seeing as this review isn’t huge like some of my others, I’ll explain why this isn’t so bad. Yes, in years they’ll crinkle and come of, but at least they give you the opportunity to use them for another MOC. Plus, if you think the detailing on the sticker is bad, you don’t have to have it on your set. Also, I’ve found stickers on transparent backing paper
The equipment thing is stopped from sliding out by a red piece on a click hinge.
The trailer has 2 compartments for gear, and behind is a hosepipe that can be pulled out when the click  hinge is down. This can be a bit hard to get out sometimes when it gets caught behind the rest of the trailer. There are some dilas above this, and the equipmeant thing can sit up here. The equipment thing has an axe, chainsaw, and light.
Overall, get this if you are a city fan only, it has no use to any other Lego fans, but is a good addition to any city.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ToriB","2008-04-15T14:35:59.577Z","Good Job","I like this set alot, It is very detailed and has alot of interesting elements. I disagree that the wheels sticking out are a bad thing, I think it gives the truck an &quot;off-road-feel&quot; that is is meant to have.

"Loganwan","2008-03-03T17:52:06.827Z","Wheels are 6 posts wide, but the truck is only 4","The truck is already skinny, then you add in the big wheels, and it looks really skinny.  There are good parts of the kit, such as the nice trailer with water and storage bins.  Another nice touch is the removable tool holder, so the system can be stored in the truck or trailer.

The over all look of the truck is nice, and suits the off road look, but I can't get over the tires sticking out so far past the wheel wells.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"lotographia","2009-05-04T03:38:17.513Z","Excellent mid-range fire fighter.","I bought this set instead of the larger fire engine because this one is the right size for my small town. I was delighted that it exceeded my expectations in every way.

I've never seen so many accessories crammed into one set. This firefighter is armed with everything he could possibly need for his job - a fire hose, a hand-held fire extinguisher, a buzz-saw, some spotlights, a radio, an oxygen mask and an axe. I would have been satisfied with half of that. Well done, Lego.

And if he doesn't need all that, he can detach the trailer, put the portable unit in the back of the truck and go to fight fire in a smaller capacity.

I can't think of any cons for this set. There are stickers, but personally I like stickers. Nothing else really strikes me as being a flaw. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-13T13:30:41.903Z","Well-designed but a way too long","This set is simply nice. It has a fair price, comes with one minifig but has lots of accessories, perhaps the most in comparison with other sets of the calibre.

The 4WD is well designed, it's not actually a normal 4WD but a rather pick-up truck. The colour scheme is nice but I think is a bit too long. It would have been definitely better if it had been 2-3 studs shorter. Moreover, good old doors would have been one more advantage as well.

The cart behind is not nice as it is too wide but the accessories put together make it look good. The 4 WD joint with the cart together fit well into any Lego city / town. It also combines very well with the 7239 and 7945.

The conception of this set was borrowed to some extent for the 7737 which I find good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-14T15:12:37.077Z","A Go-Anywhere Rescue Kit…","I was away on business recently and I popped into the local Asda for a newspaper and low and behold there was this set, the last one on the shelf for £7.99!   I think it is really good for the money it goes really well with the Fire Truck (7239) and the more recently purchased City Garage (7642).

The set comprises three main parts; the jeep, the trailer and the cradle which holds various accessories.

The Jeep:

The jeep is presented in a bright red colour scheme with white detailing and light grey wheel arches.   The jeep is of ‘4 stud width’ while the wheels and tyres increase the width overall to over 6 studs wide.   This has been well-documented by other reviewers so I wont labour the point, I guess this does make the jeep look a little odd, but on the other hand it does make it appear more like a true off-road vehicle.   The front bumper features a towing bracket, high grill with a cluster of white and blue forward-facing lights and gently sloping bonnet.   A sleek windscreen forms part of the small cab, which is immediately in front of a flatbed area for carrying various accessories.   The rear area of the flatbed has a tailgate which lowers to facilitate access to this area well.

The Trailer:

The trailer is a nice simple addition to the jeep, which follows the same colour-scheme, although the body of the trailer is slightly wider than that of the jeep.   The trailer features a single axle with rugged off-road tyres, storage lockers on either side, plus brackets for holding breathing apparatus and a fire extinguisher.   The all-important fire hose is stored in the chassis of the trailer and is accessed by lowering the rear tailgate.   There are also various consoles and gauges on the end of the trailer.   A simple ‘landing leg’ is also provided so that the trailer can stand alone when it is disconnected from the jeep.

The Accessories Cradle:

The cradle also follows the same colour-scheme as seen all through the set, and features handles for ease of transporting / moving.   There is a large ‘searchlight’ on a bracket and various tools.   The unique size and design of the cradle means that it can be stored in either the trailer or on the flatbed section of the jeep.   When the accessories cradle is stored in the trailer, it is sited above the main extendable fire hose, so this could hamper its use in an emergency situation.   

Overall, an excellent set which has a few flaws (the trailer is difficult to pivot when the ‘landing leg’ is set in the up position as it catches the rear of the jeep, there are no doors on the jeep and the light bar on the roof of the jeep looks odd without the inclusion of another, unsupplied brick), otherwise for the money it’s a pleasing set and well worth investing in while it is still around.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LEGOwikiguy","2010-02-01T14:10:27.687Z","HEY! So, where's the fire?","This set is perfect...if there was a fire to put out. Other than that, this is a very good set. A firefighter with gear, tools, and a small trailer to hold a light, axe, and chainsaw really add make the truck just as good. Price is pretty good, though $10 USD would be alot better. HEY! Pros and Cons:

Pros:
1. Semi-good price
2. Almost studless (Making it all the more realistic-looking)
3. Firefighter and gear are really cool
4. Trailer with firefighting stuff

Cons:
1. Limited playability without fire
2. Hard to put together hose
3. Same wheel problem as most small cars (Turns randomly when pushed and driven alone)

This is a very good set, and gets a 4.5/5. Easy build, it's just that annoying hose that requires work. Hope you can find this set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-29T19:45:29.903Z","Off-Road Fire Rescue","<p>Wow, for some reason, when it comes to my Lego City/Town Fire theme, I'm really sparse in this area. Luckilly this addition will even that out more.</p>

<p>This set came out in 2007 and now in 2011, it was still on the shelves at my local Wal-Mart, though marked at a price of $12.94. Marks down on&nbsp;Value for what should have been a couple bucks cheaper. Slightly steep, still worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One minifigure is included with this set, that of a Fireman. There's plent of little accessories for a Fireman to do his job from axe, saw, fire extinguisher, radio, flashlight, mask, air tank. It's loaded in that area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truck looks fairly decent too, even if the wheels seem to stick out a little bit too far. The flat bed of the truck and ""rear gate"" that folds down give it a very realistic view. It really does look very good.</p>

<p>The trailer that pulls behind isn't bad either. Hose that coils up, mobile unit for light, ""computer panels"" for gauges, side lockers to hold gear. </p>

"j_d","2020-10-31T00:46:59.18Z","Sufficient for 5 year old me","<p>*This set consists of a pickup truck with a trailer. There is one firefighter minifigure. The trailer has 2 mailbox pieces, one holds the air tank(s) and the other remains empty (assuming you keep this set sequestered from your other Lego stuff.). There is a thing of sorts that holds an axe and a circular saw and has a flood light on it. The thing can be placed in the back of the truck or on the trailer. The truck is fairly simple (like most city vehicles) There is a clip on each side of the cab. One clip holds a walkie-talkie and the other has a spotlight.</p>
