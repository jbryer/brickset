"Cashcleaner","2007-03-03T13:17:42.137Z","Nice-looking kit, but with issues of practicality","As a lego model goes, it's a solid kit with some nice detailed features, however, the overall concept and functionality really frustrates me.

The concept of a fire hovercraft is laughable in it's own right, after all, when you're fighting a fire, you really don't want to be circulating more air to help fan the flames, do you?  Also, the rotating fans at the rear of the craft extend out and beyond their cowlings, what's the point of having the protective cowlings at all if the fans stick out?  I hope no minifigs get to close to them, or else they may have to contend with some missing hands or arms!  Lastly, am I the only person getting sick and tired of Lego using the grey engine block element in so many kits?  This ever-present brick has found itself on top of the two forward intake fans.  Personally, I'd rather have Lego create a new element altogether for the fan intakes or have a new assembly altogether from other existing elements than have them use this engine block once again.

With the complaints over and done with, there are some good qualities in this kit.  Three figures is always good for a large vehicle and there is a good assortment of accessory elements. The front moving watercannon assembly is nicely detailed as well.  When all is said and done, it's a kit that I certainly would not recommend, at least not unless you are prepared to make some serious changes to it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-06-30T15:20:56.75Z","Does this type of vehicle even exist? ","I'm not sure if hovercrafts really exist in the real world, but if they did I'm sure that they would be pretty cool, because LEGO's interpretation of a fire hovercraft is just that. This set has amazing features like opening compartment with tools inside, opening cockpit with controls inside, wheels on the bottom, life preservers, posable water sprayers, spinning propellors in the back, and a 'turret' water sprayer. Also, the bags are numbered and the minifigs are awsome. Well, this is just a great set for the city fire rescue subtheme; works great with any coast guard set too.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is such a fun vehicle, and when the box says it can move in any direction, they are not kidding.  I think the best feature is the two main engines that blow air into the hovercraft &quot;pillow.&quot;  They rotate to face which ever direction the hovercraft is moving, which I think is a great touch.

It is a great source of power for the fire team, with three big cannons (the front cannon being a double cannon). It can really get into any position that they fire crews would need.  It would also be able to go into shallow areas that the larger fire boat could not venture, besides being able to go on the beach if need be.

I recommend this set to any Fire or City fan.  It is really worth the money.  Besides with the way it is built, it can be taken apart and made into another form of hovercraft since everything is built onto the hovercraft skirt as a base.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
