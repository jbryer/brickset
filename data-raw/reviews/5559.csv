The cabs of the new fire engines (bumper, lights, grill, minifig compartment) are superb and modern. I wish Lego would drop the &quot;superbrick&quot; elements though... i.e. the verticle 2x5 columns and 6x5 walls.

The garagedoors, four firefighters, nice skylights, lots of tools (handsets, fire extinguishers, axes, broom etc.) for the minifigs. If I have to find one bad aspect it would be the rather large variance in color between otherwise identical bricks.
This set is truly a(nother) sign that LEGO is back on track - just like in the early 90'ies.

"Cashcleaner","2007-02-12T13:03:14.307Z","One of the better City kits available - but there are still problems...","After waiting so long to get my hands on this kit, I must say I'm not disappointed with the new Fire Station.  The building itself is solidly built and literally sprawls from one end to the other.  The attention to detail is superb, and there is a load of cool firefighting equipment that comes in the box such as extinguishers, oxygen tanks, etc.  All said, it's one of the best fire stations I've seen.

The kit, however, is not perfect and there are a few problem areas I have come across after building and displaying the finished product.  Firstly, the vehicle bays are a bit small and you really have to squeeze the larger  truck in carefully to avoid clipping the inside walls.  Looking at it from a practical point of view, the poor Lego firefighters seem to have to push the truck outside from the back so someone can get into the driver's seat!  The ceiling clearance is also an issue for the larger truck and is you place the second firefighter in his seat at the back, his helmet will scrap up against the garage door when it's retracted.  At the end of the day, you have to decide if these issues are really that big a deal or not.  Personally, I picked this kit up to be the headquarters for my recently created Lego Fire Department and was hoping to display it without any alterations.  I'm a bit disappointed in that I'll have to make a few changes to better accomodate the vehicles, but the kit is still worth the price, in my opinion.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I came close to getting the fire station released in 2005 several times but it didn't do much for me, I'm glad I waited. Love the roll up doors! Nice layout that can easily be changed without much trouble. Big fire engine is Awesome and like the smaller one to.

I actually built mine back to front to accommodate a right hand curve in Tabletown - the centre section is the same as depicted, but the outer areas are built in a mirror image - it works a treat and fits beautifully - I love the modular nature of this set.

"Blade","2007-07-16T09:37:56.983Z","The Hot House","Well after reading other reviews i thought it was time to write my own. 

I bought this model for 3 reasons. 

1 It was on sale
2 it was the only one left
3 it looked really cool on the box

Turns out it is really cool. this is my my first fire house and meets most standards i would expect as a long time collector. i have herd previous models dont meet standards which is a shame.

The duel garage for both vehicles is awesome and the way all 3 pieces lock together so nicely i would love to buy 3 and make a massive one. Sliding doors on the bottom story and lots of sky lights make this model a must. Also the old school opening garages doors really add to the class of this set.

Still this set is not without flaw. Garages need to be slightly lengthened and garage no. 2 is too low so by using the crane seat the truck is unable to go in or out. These big one piece bricks or super bricks really simplify the model and kills some of the challenge.

My other final annoyance is with the instructions the fire house seems so easy maybe too many steps. As for the vehicles, not very clear particularly in the mid section of the larger truck showing blocks that aren't there. i dont think im crazy, just a stickler for detail and find this really annoying. Especially if you pull it down and the parts get mixed with other models you would be thinking you have lost parts that never existed.

Anyway over all i give this model an 8/10. i really like it but these flaws really let the model down, but i would still recommend this model as a top buy with slight modification for playability. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"marvinblue007","2007-07-04T05:45:43.81Z","Big Fan!!","I'm really happy with this set. The vehicles are very realistic, which is a big plus! The mod by Marc Gagnon over at Eurobricks for the Bronto was quite simple and allows a firefighter to manipulate the controls quite easily. I also love how the two engine bays and the main building join together, something that will be copied to add extra engine bays for the other truck and 4WD in the fire series.

All up, a well thought-out set, glad to see Lego get back to its roots.

This is a must have for anyone who is making a starter city or even a regular city!  It is complete w/opening garage doors, two vheicles, a bunk, an office, and a dispatch center.
Perfect, you might think, but not so.....
CONS:(only two)
-for the bay of the tower it needs to be higher up because it is a tight fit.

However, the larger garage is kind of cramped and doesn't fit the entire truck when the door is closed. the inside of the building has a command center on top, the downstairs has a computer and chair, a coffee maker, and a strange mat which I'm guessing is a bed. this set has been out for a awhile, so I suggest you get it while it lasts.

"cbaoth","2008-01-31T17:56:46.403Z","good set, vehicles are excellent","This is the first lego set I bought in 20 years and was my introduction to lego to my four year old daughter and the only reason I bought it was because she was going to visit the local fire station on a kindergarden trip so I wanted to give her an idea what to expect.

Building this brought back to my why I loved lego so much as kid and it really brought home to me how much the blocks have improved to make the sets more realistic without overly simplifying the construction.

Anyway, I digress. The vehicles are excellent, both have nice features to play with. The fire tender is particularly good with hose and massively extendable boom. Makes me want to build a house big enough for it!

I found the garage doors a bit fiddly to put together but their realistic operation makes up for that. I agree with other reviewers that the bigger garage should have been a block higher to better accomodate the fire tender but it should be easily amended by most builders.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T18:39:11.217Z","Excellent fire station","I got this set  for my birthday and I like it tons. The building itself is very well designed. The windows and walls are awesome. Inside the building there are 2 computers, 2 radar screens, a bed, coffee maker, and cups. The set also comes with a fire car and an engine, both are very well made and sleek, better than the ones back in the 1990s, because those didn't even have roofs. The set also comes with accessories like phones, shovel, broom, brush, fire extinguishers, axes, flowers and a tree. I've no problem fitting the engine into the garage. The engine is fully functional with a working boom. I like how the car has a trunk. I used the window roof for other uses, and I added another floor to the building. Where the 1st floor has a 1x5x6 red brick, I replaced it with a window. It was a little pricey, but definetely worth the buy. I give this set 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"00se7en","2009-01-12T19:49:27.793Z","Very good update to the fire station line","This is the second Fire Station set I have owned, the first being #6382 from 1981.  Comparing these two sets, this one is better in all ways except one:  Unlike 6382 which uses 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, etc. bricks for the walls, this set has a small number of huge bricks where only two or three will make up entire walls.  While this might make the model easier to assemble for younger builders, it certainly limits the possibilities for creating other structures.  Besides this I have no complaints about this set.  The vehicles are far superior to the 1980s models and much more fun to build.  The set looks great and there are lots of nice touches on the inside including a coffee maker and sliding glass doors.

Comparing the packaging is also interesting.  The modern photography and editing of the pictures certainly makes this set look more exciting than the older set.  However, if you manage to get one of these in the original US packaging, look carefully on the back of the box and you will see a couple of photo retouching errors where some of the vehicle wheels are superimposed on themselves!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2009-10-12T15:03:16.293Z","The best Lego fire station ever","The 7945 is indeed the best in Lego history, holding it own against even the famous 6571. The design of the whole complex is excellent combining the central tower and 2 garages in a very nice way. 4 minifigs is quite ok since now there's a privately set rule of putting 5 minifigs at most.
The smaller car is pretty ok but could have been better. Yet it is well designed and functional: the booth can open and stores the equipment.
The truck is the best about this set. In my opinion this is the best Lego fire engine ever as it has very nice proportions, foldable lift with a white cradle that can extend up to 40 cm so, Lego City can get relaxed as all the roofs can be reached.
The truck is better than that of 7239, as the frontal part is mor eimpressive and it is longer, which makes it look more realistic.

The colour scheme of the whole set is nice as well, red+white is diluted with nice plants and yellow hoardings.

Along with the famous 7239 and some other sets they make the best of firefighting services. 7239 truck and this one fit very well together as they are a bit similar but keep their own features like the structure of the lift / telescopic ladder.

I relly don't understand why after just 2 years a very good set which the 7945 is, is substituted for something dull that is not so well worked out and has a truck with a ladder instead of a lift-type structure.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dilego1000","2011-12-18T10:38:40.173Z","Very good, and a good design","I bought this set in 2010 and i get very surprised about it. I like it very much and it looks very modern. Also, making a comparision with the two others fire city stations it looks better. Why? because it has lots of glass an it has a&nbsp; lot of light.

There is a little bed so in your&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;guys can sleep, but it was clearly an after thought. There is&nbsp;practically&nbsp;no room to fit your hand in, so ya.&nbsp;Plus&nbsp;the truck can't fit in the garage without the basket sticking out.

The car and truck are built from the chassis up. A little bit of Technic is used in building the fire engine. The building is built in 3 large sections: the small garage, the large garage, and the center of the building. Each of these is assembled individually, and the three sections are joined together at the end of the build to create the fire station. This is the most frustrating part, since force is needed to join them together, and the fragile building sections sometimes collapse under the force! The sections themselves are easy to build, especially with the structure being mostly comprised of 1x2 columns and large beams. Another challenging part is assembling the garage doors out of the individual sections, and then installing them in the tracks. Yes, the set does include stickers; generally, I don&#39;t mind them, but there is one problem here. The signs above the garage doors are made up of two 1x6 bricks stacked on top of each other, and the large stickers attach to both bricks&nbsp;at the same time, thus limiting the ways these bricks can be used in alternate builds.</span></span></span></span></p>

On the opposite side, there is a compartment that opens to store stuff, such as a fire extinguisher or other tools. The outriggers (stabilizers), can be lowered to keep the truck steady.

The garages also have lights on the front to illuminate the entrances, skylights, and fire department signs above each door. On one side of the larger garage, there is storage for tools, and a faucet for filling the bucket for washing the vehicles. On the other side, it has hooks for hanging up the included ladder. The entrance to the first floor of the building has a sliding door which is very cool! Inside, there is a desk with a chair, computer, and telephone, and on the opposite side of the door, there is a table with a coffee machine, and next to that is the entrance to a tiny room with a bed. On the second floor is the chief&rsquo;s office, with a swivel chair and another desk with computers. The glass (plastic) roof and windows let in a LOT of light up here, and the roof actually hinges open so that the chief can gave an open-air office if he wants. At the side is a door that opens onto the roof so that he can go outside for some fresh air, or oversee the operations being conducted all around. Unfortunately, there are no stairs that lead up to the second level, either inside or outside. This always frustrated me when I was a kid. I suppose you could add your own stairs if you want &ndash; after all, it is LEGO! There are also two sirens on either side of the building to alert firefighters of an emergency &ndash; nice detail here!
