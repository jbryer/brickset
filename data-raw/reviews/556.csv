"Novelty","2007-05-07T11:48:11.467Z","Flim Flam alakazam!","The contents of this set: a wizard, his glow in the dark wand, a grey parrot, a treasure chest, 2 wheels and some assorted pieces that makes the cart.  This set is great if one is looking for an army of wizards, or a large collection of wands, grey parrots or treasure chest, because it is so small it is economically to purchase quite a large quantity of it.  On its own there isn't really any redeption - why would a wizard want to hand carry a cart when he could presumably fly or teleport?",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"MEGADETH","2008-03-13T06:05:54.497Z","Good simple set","I think merlin is the first witch on castle theme lego, this set contain merlin with his parrot and small treasure chest carrier. You also get his glow in the dark star staff! 
I recommand this set if you only want to collect some unique figure from dragon knight's theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"freakmamma","2011-12-13T09:41:16.517Z","Great for the figure and accessories","Even though this is a small set it was something, at the time, that you could pick up cheap and get some great useable items with high replay value in the entire Castle system.&nbsp; The wand and chest are worth the suggested price so the wizard is like a bonus.&nbsp; The bird / falcon was nice but a little out of scale in my opinion.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,2,4
"Gus_263","2008-03-17T17:01:28.95Z","Classic wizard","Good set, an addition from the classic castle. More simple, but more cool than the new included on new castle. The newers are more silly, have printings on hat, and things for only childrens that likes lego. This, i think, that everyone that likes lego will like. This don't have a storyline, but the owner of the toy have to create this. Another thing is the cart, made with useful pieces, still good in any sets, and is the owner that decides if the wizard carries one or not. Features of the set are the cart, the hat, beard and cool colors of the complete set. His staff glows in the dark. This is a little set, if you wants a little set of classic castle, this is one great choice, 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-03-26T18:21:46.827Z","Nice to own for a collector.","<p>Overall 3 bricks : not a must have set, only for a Castle collector. Still a nice set with the small cart, also usefull with other Castle themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 2 bricks : not a real building effort, just the small cart so 2 bricks is sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : Nice usefull parts in this small set, the cart wheels, the bird and the magic stick. The minifigure with beard is ok too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : the single set doesn't offer much playing or building&nbsp;fun but added to other sets it is nice and usefull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks : Bricklink offers an average of â‚¬ 4,50 which is ok for a set this age and size. Only has its value complete with magic stick and instructions.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,3
