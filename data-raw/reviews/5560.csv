"Kid_Paddle","2007-02-05T04:22:50.49Z","Let's build it!","This is amazing! Being able to build a construction machine that looks so real with only 68 pieces is really cool!
There are instructions for three models, but with a little bit of imagination, you can also build other cool stuff with it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-10-20T15:17:45.467Z","Great Little Set for the Price","This Creator set is a value for the price. The 3 main building ideas are cool and almost make me want to buy another set so that I can build all 3 models at once. This set and instructions would be the basis of a great mini scale collection of construction vehicles.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AddictedToStyrene","2007-12-17T05:10:24.543Z","Nice little construction set","I like this set because it is small (and cute) but it still makes a nice piece of construction equipment. You could pick this up for travel, or as an inexpensive present. It would fit in well with the Tiny Turbos (the Hot Wheels or Matchbox sized cars).
Construction is fairly easy. You build two main stages - the chassis and the digger. I am not sure I like the way the scoop is made - but I can't think of another way to construct it in that scale. 
If you aren't good at building big Lego projects (yet) then this set is an inspiration for what you can produce with just a few little pieces. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2009-02-15T06:59:21.733Z","Sit down and shut up!"," That's exactly what you'll do as soon as you're alone with this set. 3 in 1 doesn't even start to cut it. As said in previous reviews, there is plenty more to this than meets the eye. Because you have quite a variety of pieces in a small set, the only limit to what you can create is your own imagination. Great little set, available in supermarkets and the like, so chuck one in your trolley next time you do your weekly shop, just make sure you put your food away first!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brankell5566","2008-06-29T14:13:21.077Z","Good Set","This is a small set to add to you construction crew!This set is very useful.You can bring it on a long trip.thats what i did.Overall great set!

Pros:Small set and comes with a sturdy little box
     
     Very useful 
     
     Can take it on long trips

Cons:The scoop of the digger breaks easily

     That about it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jakelongdragon","2008-08-03T11:49:53.81Z","100 in 1 set","They say this is a 3 in 1 set but I made so many different little vehicles with this set it was more a 100 in 1 set for me! The set contains 6 wheels and a lot of articulation. There is a small piece to allow 360 deg rotation and plenty of plates with stumps. I used one of the wheel axles as a &quot;scooper&quot; instead of the one on the instructions and it worked better. It's a great set for $5.00 and if you have a lot of other construction set pieces you can put them all in the container box and carry it all with you wherever you want. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:57:59.34Z","Three Good Models","This set has a nice yellow and dark grey color scheme, with black accents. All three models are pretty solid. The main model is my favorite, though there are also instructions for a forklift and truck. The designs are pretty realistic looking considering the parts available and size of the models. I'd give the set an 81/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"davy_jones","2009-03-24T21:25:09.42Z","A stepping stone?","This set is now not available altough set 4916 mini animal/monkey can still be commonly found. I would say it was the second best selling set after 4918 mini flyer. I look at this set as kind of a stepping stone because it was after getting this set that I decided to move to bigger Lego sets after a long time. On its own, it has merits to justify the Lego logo that it carries. However, since many reviews already talk about that I'll talk about where this set fits in a collection. Since it cant hold minifigs, it would be out of place in a diorama. The best thing would be to create a separate set up for Creator series' or simply build and rebuild as many times then incorporate the various pieces into other MOCs. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Danielator36","2015-01-05T04:14:33.373Z","Cool Set!","<p>The set in general is really nice!</p>

<p>The box is really nice, and the instructions were very clear. The parts included were very basic parts, yet they are essential for many designs. The build&nbsp;was fairly standard, but there were a few times where it was a bit difficult to build the sets. All three completed model looks really nice. In summary, I think the set has great value for its price.</p>
