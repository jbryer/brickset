The only one I built was the monkey as it looked okay its poseable and is easy to stand up but looks too roboty in my opion the arms move but they can't hold anything its head turns but still looks a bit big overal an okay set if you need a big monkey or some brown pieces.

"ratz","2007-08-09T16:47:03.613Z","your personal cheetah","to me the main advantage of this set seems to be the part selection, it is kind of a &quot;tree-set&quot;: brown parts for the trunk, plus green leaves - with 3 or even 2 of these sets you can make up a decent tree. also you get some usually rare tan bits, which is a quite pleasant touch.
the models are all ok, the turkey looks a bit damaged, having only 2 feathers on each wing. the reptile is not bad either, and the monkeys poseability has already been mentioned.

so those who love nature, have to buy plastic, esp. this set!

I debated whether or not to buy these sets, I mean how much LEGO do I need? Well, the reduced price and a close study of the parts that came with this set convinced me to pick it up. 
First the negative: the models look terrible. They have many points of articulation but they look extremely blocky/unrealistic. I was disappointed by the models but I knew going in that I bought it for the parts.
Now the positive, the parts! They are brown and tan for the most part. They are specialty parts as well such as bricks with handles, plates with handles, offset plates, brackets, studs, and headlight bricks. There is also a black lightsaber rod.
I think that if I bought this set solely based on wanting to build the models in the instruction manual I would have been terribly disappointed. The parts are well worth the purchase price for this reviewer however.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Also, it's designed with posable leggs, mandible, feet, arms, hands, head, and tail. It also comes with an extra leaf thing. And, of course, it can be reconstructed into a couple of other models too. Great set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"asianlego","2008-09-25T08:27:45.45Z","Monkey See Monkey Do","Seeing the nice combination of tan and brown parts (think Steampunk), I immediately purchased this Creator set. It was chock full of useful pieces and parts that I think most people would not turn down. The leaves were a nice touch, too. But the leaves are smaller than the usual leaves of the same shape and they could throw in another pair of leaves so I could create a coconut tree. All in all, great choice of parts! Recommended for steampunk MOCers and just those trying out Lego with not much to spend.

I like the way that it is cleverly put together and the palm tree leaves are useful for scenery.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
