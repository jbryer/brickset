"Beren","2007-05-20T01:48:12.163Z","Lots of good basic parts","I don't especially like any of the models that you can make using the instructions. The great thing about this set is the amount of parts that you get, especially good, basic parts like plates, windows, wheels and so on. As a result, this is an excellent set for a young person starting out on their Lego adventures. Also, unlike some other reviewers, I really like the colour. I wouldn't have bought it if it was blue.

In summary, a good set for people who want to create their own models and designs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There are many yellow and clear pieces of this particular piece and for 10 bucks, you can't go wrong if you like this piece.

"adik_sa_lego","2007-12-30T11:26:25.67Z","finally!","finally found this set in our local supermarket, the least likely place i would've gotten it.

i stuck with the original instructions since i have a lot of trucks and F1 cars already, and i must say, it could pass off as a lamborghini licensed set. interior was detailed (manual transmission lever, airconditioning), roomy trunk (i fit all the extra pieces in it), fun and challenging construction without being frustrating.

an engine detail would've been a nice touch at the rear compartment, but overall i have no qualms about this set. it's also about time one got a &quot;neutral&quot; car for his/her town or city.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AA01","2007-12-09T13:34:21.467Z","Great Kit!","I saw this kit sitting on the shelf and debated weather or not to pick it up. After building one of the models, I do not regret the purchase. Bang-for-buck this is one of the best Lego kits i have bought.

The good: There are many pieces to this kit. It makes a Great desk toy. The kit is not overly complex, but is intricate enough to have things like the doors and trunk open.

The bad: The only thing i can really say i was disappointed with is that the shot on the front shows the wheels turned, and this model does not have any steering. Other than that, I don't have any complaints

The main model is the best in this kit in my opinion. It looks very detailed for the small number of pieces and overall size.

"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:49:22.577Z","A Bit Lackluster","Cool Cars is not as good as some other creator sets, though it's still a fairly good set. One issue I have with the set is the color: I'm sure yellow probably appeals to the kids, but I'd personally prefer a different color. After all, how many bright yellow rigs are there out there? But that's not a huge issue, and the two car models look fine in yellow. The models aren't blocky for the most part; the rig comes closest to being blocky, which is ironic because the rig is my favorite of the three models in this set. There are details on the vehicles here and there, such as working doors and a trunk, but not as many details as you see in other creator sets. Also, while the door design on main model is good overall, it doesn't leave much space for windows to see out of. This is a good set to get if you want lots of yellow (with black and dark grey accents, and a number of clear parts), but it's not a must have like a number of the other creator sets are. I'd give the set a 70/100.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Xenon","2008-12-17T21:07:32.483Z","Vroom Vroom!","This set is a 3 in 1 set which builds a sports car, a semi truck and a race car. The sports car is the best one out of the models in exterior and interior details. It also features opening doors and trunk. The semi is okay but mediocre and features opening doors. The race car is just a yellow race car with no features.

"lego12","2008-04-24T08:55:35.89Z"," This set is actually cool...","  This Creator set has a nice color and you can build it into three other models (Semi, race car, and a sports car). The doors can open and close. The trunk of the sports car can open  and you can put things inside of it. The semi's doors can also open. This set is cheap considering the fact it is $12.99. It is a fun set and it contains 206 pieces.

It was a great set on clearance for the yellow parts.. Ive never built the set, but it doesnt really look like it actually has a steering mechanism. 

Cars would be small when built as they are only about 8 wide. Good for kids.

If I could get more of these for the price I paid on clearance, I would definately do it just for the yellow plates and slopes.

"Lambman","2008-12-30T09:12:49.873Z","Nice Cars","This is a great set. I got it when I was looking for a clone troopers battlepack but I got my hands on one of these babys instead. It is full of great building possibilities! I made the main models, but then I made an almost to Minifig scale Corvette and Its awsome! I love putting my sig-fig behind the wheel. Anyway, the main models are a slick sportscar, a nice racecar, and a big truck. My fav is definitely the sports car. Oh ya, also, it has a great price! 206 pieces for 12 bucks!

"stevosowl","2009-11-18T17:24:09.25Z","A nice creator car","The second creator car in my collection, have made two of the models so far.

Model 1 - sportscar - this is the star of the 3 models, a nice bright yellow ""Lambo"" style car. 8 pegs wide and 18 long it is a good overall size.

pros:
'lambo' doors
opening boot/ engine compartment
nice style

cons:
will not fit minifig

Model 2- tractor - this was the first model i made with this set. it was an easy build and the overall effect is quite detailed - remarkable as it uses the bits from the lambo sportscar.

pros:
very detailed
a good looking model

cons:
much smaller than the car
does not fit minifig
no steering wheel in cab
a flimsy construction on the cab",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This car can work for city, but the minifig has to lay down in the car. I realy liked how LEGO put gull wing doors and an openinng trunk.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-21T08:45:01.727Z","LEGO Creator - Cool Cars Review","This set is the biggest set of the LEGO Creator theme I've got. You can build 3 different models but you can't build all of them at once. This set may doesn't have so many play features but it's very easy to maneuver these vehicles around. All of these 3 models are very easy to build and fun to play with. We also don't get any stickers to worry about. I've also tried to put in a minifigs in these cars but there's no room for them in there. The other 2 models you can build with this set are a truck and an IndyCar.

Granted, I have to position the steering wheel weird and have to remove a few arms for his wife to ride in it too, but it's worth it. Much better than my rocket-powered Police Cruiser idea.

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-04-05T21:02:00.02Z","The set name underestimates the sheer coolness of this thing.","<p>Today I&#39;m reviewing one of my first LEGO sets, the Creator Cool Cars. Mostly I&#39;m working from memory and this little pic of the box, so bear with me if I pull out the rose-colored lenses for a bit...</p>

<p>Box/Instructions<br />
I seem to remember the box being today&#39;s standard $15 size. The instructions have also been lost to time, but they were divided into one book for the main model and one for the alternates. Typical Creator style, of course, I didn&#39;t know that at the age of four.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts<br />
When I got this, I was in awe at the parts selection. That lovely old dark red, and the Technic wheels, clip hinges, cheese slopes, and curves were all new to me. Before, I was just working with my dad&#39;s old collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures<br />
2007 is before the advent of minifigs in Creator sets. Of course, they wouldn&#39;t be here today anyway. Moving on...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build<br />
It does what it&#39;s supposed to do. At the same time basic and refreshing, I had a blast building it. Taking it apart to build alternate models, though, was an entirely different matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model<br />
It&#39;s a very cool car. The doors and trunk open revealing a full interior and space for grocery bags, it&#39;s filled to the brim with good parts for a little kid like me moving into a world of LEGO seven and a half years ago, and it has some brilliant alternate models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion<br />
As a four and a half year old kid, I loved this set. I rebuilt it recently, and believe me, it doesn&#39;t disappoint. If you like this sort of set, you could probably eBay it for very little money. Very much reccomended!</p>
