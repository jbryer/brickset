"Cashcleaner","2007-02-17T12:06:09.7Z","Awesome Lego House","Definitely one of the best kits Lego has produced.  There are so many nice features to this house it's hard to count them all.

The wrap-around porch is probably the biggest selling point for me, with the front garden looking quite nice as well.  The only weak part on the exterior for me is the garage, but that is only a matter of personal preference.  It's well worth the price, and is a great addition to any Lego collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bsmarthen","2007-05-18T19:05:32.853Z","Great","Great set so many things to build with it. I have bouht 5 so far. You get a large amount of bricks in this set and 3 house plans to choose from. But that is only the start. There is alot of fun waiting in this box.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-02T21:07:12.14Z","A pleasure to build","I purchased this set recently after a period of indecisiveness. Wow, was I glad I finally gave it a chance! For a town enthusiast such as myself, this is just the kind of set needed to build some structure to a town and makes a welcome break from all the emergency/rescue sets. The three models for which instructions are included are all very nice in their own right and the attention to detail is great.

The only small problem I have is that it would have been nice to have a few more windows to use at the back of the house. Also, a couple of minifig residents would have been cool. Overall though, I'm very happy with the direction lego is taking in producing sets such as this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"marvinblue007","2007-08-25T01:35:49.333Z","Great start to alternative buildings!","This set, like 4954, builds up really well and has really nice details. (I built the single story house, wth the garage on the left). For me, there are two faults; the garage isn't long enough to accept any city vehicles (i.e. the yellow car from the Service Station or the Doctor's car), and there are no interior pieces. For the price, (AU$68), it would've bee nice to have them. However, this doesn't take anything away from the finished building, it looks great in my suburbia!! :-) Nice to see Lego producing buildings other than Emergency Services buildngs! Nothing wrong with them, just need a town to protect!! :-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-10-20T15:07:38.2Z","Not Another White/Red House!","Great designs but the rating is brought down due to the same old color scheme of red and white! The 32 X 32 baseplate is awesome. The new garage style is a change from what I loved as a kid in the 80's but it is functional and aesthetic. The Town House Creator set is much better because of the huge selection of tan pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"MetroiD","2009-01-30T18:18:44.793Z","Bricks galore","Let's be honest, unless you're new to house building, you won't be that much impressed by the 3 models which can be constructed using this set's manuals. Fair enough, they all seem to be pretty neat houses, but the level of attention to detail did not quite live up to my expectations and I found the smaller 4996 set to be a more enjoyable build.

That, however, is not really an issue - after all, the Creator sets are not supposed to be as intricate as the Factory Modular Houses, so one could say this house serves its purpose just right.

What IS really great about it at the end of the day is the amount of bricks included. Yes, they may be just a truckload of those same ol' white bricks and red rooftiles, however there's simply not much else you would need in order to construct a perfectly fine looking house yourself. Plus, the bricks would make a welcome addition if you're in need of more rooftiles and for one reason or another cannot order them from bricklink...

As to myself, being a fan of city-themed sets and in the process of building a town, this set was a definite must-have and its contents alone earn it a 4.5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"inorde","2009-10-07T03:43:31.763Z","Great set, a lot of bricks!","When this set went on sale (€35) we bought 2. There are so many bricks in this that this set is better then any of the seperate roof pieces or brick boxes put together.

The different designs are good looking, fun to build and big as well. The price/quality value of this set is one of the best I've seen.

Apart from the three builds you can create with instructions, there's enough to build your own design. No minifigs though, but we have enough of those.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jake9","2010-11-22T14:55:13.9Z","Amazing Curb Appeal","This set is a good value for the money. You get 3 designs and over 700 pieces. Most of the pieces are basic bricks and slopes, however. There are no unique pieces in this set so don't expect anything new when you open the box.<div><br></div><div>The roof uses a bunch of red slopes and it looks like a real roof when done. The dormers look excellent around the two windows, and the roof looks very realistic the way it slants down and conforms to the garage. The top lifts off to allow play on the inside. You can also see in the picture that the house looks like a two story. But there is only one level inside. It's kind of misleading, but it looks great from the exterior.</div><div><br></div><div>The wrap-around porch looks great and very realistic. I love the arches over the verandha. The alternating colors on the walkways front and rear are a nice feature that has become common in these Creator houses. It was very satisfying to look at when finished, so high scores for the build experience.</div><div><br></div><div>A good value, great looking, and fun to build set. Not for the builder looking for unique and uncommon pieces however. But it's a VERY nice house for your minifigs to live in.</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5

I&nbsp;absolutely adore the post box and i do like the little tree. there is enough space in the back garden to add little features like what&nbsp;is&nbsp;did like a compost bin and a recycling bin a BBQ and a small table. it comes with enough space inside to put in little features like a fridge and a bed, but not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;space to&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;lots of things.</div><div><br></div><div>conclusion</div><div><br></div><div>overall, this set would be nice to make a&nbsp;movie&nbsp;set or something to show off, but never try to edit the inside, from experience,&nbsp;I&nbsp;would know.&nbsp;&nbsp;overall a&nbsp;beauty&nbsp;on the outside but not so nice on&nbsp;what's&nbsp;on the inside, can have a great deal of&nbsp;fun with&nbsp;the out but all crammed on the in</div><div><br></div><div>thankyou</div>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,4
"Mama_Eli","2010-01-26T16:03:43.827Z","Good play with the kid","I bought it on sale for BGN96 - which translates to EUR 48 - which is not sale at all compared to the rest of the prices are read in the reviews. 


I like the look of the houses - so neat and nice. The set surprised me how much specific uncommon bricks there are in compared to a bucket. The designs are just the right for my needs - I am 39 and I wanted some fun with my daughter who will be 7 in few weeks time. 

She was very enthusiastic when she saw the box and was after me for several days to open it. Some of the page instructions she read by herself and was happy to construct herself. 

Thus it was not boring for me nor too complicated for her - good time spent together.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legokoala","2010-07-26T12:54:07.077Z","The House","<p>This Lego house is certainly realistic. The colors are real and everything. Its easy to play inside. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish it had minifigures to go with it. If you are going to have a house, you need someone to live in it. I have alot of minifigures so that didn't affect me much. I think the garden of flowers in the front was a nice touch to it. The mail box is easy to fall off, but thats normal. I lost the mailbox in a heap of other legos so I had to make a different one. But other than that, it was good. </p>

<p>If you are good at losing things, be careful with that mailbox. But have fun.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"av8r1973","2011-01-06T08:01:25.607Z","Lots of variety and options in a Creator house","This kit allows three separate models to be built with the included instructions. &nbsp;The B and C models result in a lot of leftover pieces that let you add to the yards. &nbsp;We built the B model first and had enough parts left to customize the roof, build a gazebo in the back yard and an arched entry in the front. &nbsp;After that, we still had enough left to build a short brick wall around the back and sides. &nbsp;Pretty cool.<div><br></div><div>The interiors are entirely empty, so don't expect much playability inside. &nbsp;The fun comes from building the different models. &nbsp;The generic colors let you share parts with the rest of your structures, so it's a great value.</div><div><br></div><div>Each of the three houses is entirely unique from the others and is nicely executed. &nbsp;Fairly standard build process, but neat-looking homes. &nbsp;All of the parts can be found in other kits, too. &nbsp;The creeping vines up the side were a nice touch I plan to add to some other structures. &nbsp;I hadn't thought of that. &nbsp;We added the house to our Cityscape and it fits right in. &nbsp;We put minifigs in the yard and it completed the family look.</div><div><br></div><div>Good value for the brickcount and versatility. &nbsp;It's recommended if you are looking to increase a building count inexpensively, or to have multiple models to choose from.</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
"Ernst","2012-05-06T18:46:47.05Z","Not spectacular but a solid Creator set","<p>Overall 4 bricks : This is another good Creator House. Nothing really spectacular, simply 3 solid designs. Same goes for the used parts, nothing really new but a load of usefull bricks in this set. The 3 results look very nice which is very good considering parts and colors are average. So if you can find it for a reasonable price it is a set worth buying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : not a very difficult set to built, I will review the separate houses and mention the things I like or not. I start with book 1, 2 and 3 will follow in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Book 1, house with porch : A nice house with standard building, starting with the tiles for front entrance and small backyard terr ace. Very nice detail is that the floor for the porchpassage is lifted with the small black plates. The house itself is ""standard"" building but nice. Good details are the garage entrance and ventilation in the garage. The use of bowes make the porch and house very elegant. The use of slopes above the porch make the house look bigger and give it a great look. The tree made of bricks in stead of the plastic tree is very good, nice detail is the mailbox. Overall a great design with&nbsp;good color setting and&nbsp;a nice garden.</li></ul>
<p>Parts 3 bricks : Good parts used without any parts that strike me as special. I love the bowes, the green plant leaves, white cornerbricks are usefull just like all other parts. This set is a good one for building your own future&nbsp;projects. Missing is a minifigure who lives in the house. I also like the 32x32 baseplate, newer Creator sets often contain smaller ones like 16x32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : like all Creator sets the possibilty to built 3 designs so enough playing fun since building is playing. Would have been 5 bricks with a car and mini figure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : The RRP in Holland was I guess some €55,00 which is ok. Bricklink gives a used average of still some €50,00 which I consider a bit high, I would say €40,00 would be sufficient since the set is good but doesn't offer something really special.</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,4,4
"SpartecusNL","2018-01-31T00:29:10.853Z","Lego Creator House","<p>When I was younger I was never into Lego creator sets but then one time around Christmas I got this set form my mother.</p>

<p>At first I was suprised&nbsp;I never had gotten a creator set so I gave it a go. Build the challenging set and after a couple of hours I was done&nbsp;and really happy with the building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can remove the roof and with that you can access&nbsp;the&nbsp;interior of the house and garage. Its just big enough&nbsp;to put a car in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I give it a solid 5!</p>

"Puffypolo","2023-01-29T13:08:13.15Z","Nice Creator housing inspiration","<p>This is one of the great houses of Creator with nice B and C models for urban layouts.</p>

<p>My favourite is the arched house, the main reason why I bought two - one for pieces and one for permanent display.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get lots of roof slopes, white bricks and a set of windows and doors.</p>

<p>The garage is small but easily can be stretched.</p>
