"wyoeaglefan","2006-12-28T11:22:58Z","Awesome Set","            This is one of Legos best Creator sets so far. The wings fold in and out, but they are also very sturdy! The entire construction of the plane is very durable and the set is very detailed. It even has landing gear that folds up into the fuselage! Another point is that you can build a hovercraft or a helicopter with the same pieces! I recomend it to any collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2007-02-08T07:27:24.557Z","GET WITH THE JET SET","I bought this set just to make the jet fighter, although there are full instructions for a helicopter and a hovercraft too. The jet fighter looks really good (F14 -esque) and has excellent working features, most notable of which is the swing wing – I couldn’t wait to find out how it would work. The answer is a combination of 2x2 turntable bricks to provide the pivots above and below the wings and some Technics innards with ball joint links which project rearwards to a couple of joined beams which project through the rear between the tail fins - push in and the wings fold back, pull it out and they open. There is also a retractable undercarriage together with working rear wheel well hatches – which also look like airbrakes – take your pick.  The ailerons and horizontal tail planes are also moveable. 

The finished item is quite sturdy and with these working features playability is going to be good for numerous missions. I know Lego does like promoting war and military machines (except Star WARs of course!), but this would look better with some external stores under the wings – a couple of long range fuel tanks could have been added which are not weapons. In its clean state and red white and blue colour scheme perhaps it is supposed to represent an example that might have been flown by a national aerobatic display team – a few of these sets in formation together would certainly look spectacular.

The jet looks so good and I it like so much I have no intention of making the other models. Unusually for me I did not add any tweaks as I built it, but I will probably tweak it to add the under wing stores. For the look, sturdy build quality and working features to enhance playability and the price of 15 GBP this set is impossible to fault really – I don’t think anyone who buys it will be disappointed, so for me it rates a maximum score.

I was surprized to find that it had adjustable tail wings and the flaps on the wing. Theres no prolem with the landing gear though it would have been cool ifyou could lower them with a lever or gear something like that. The main model is buitifully detailed one of my favorite parts is the air intakes built with castle windows. As someone else mentioned this thing should be gray or black as it would have looked better  but Lego seems determoied not to make any miatary vehicles. All inall its a great set worth buying and great for displaying. 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2007-02-17T22:54:25.827Z","Excellent fighter jet, but alternate models are lacking","I picked this bad-boy up a few weeks back and love the look of the F-14.  The primary kit is well put together and the variable position wings are a fantastic touch.  All said, it's great value for money at (CAN), but there are a few issues I have.  

Firstly, while the primary model is great, I'm no fan of the alternates.  That's just my preference, but I didn't even attempt to build the hovercraft or helicopter.  The problems I have with the Fighter Jet is mostly the colour scheme and the lack of a proper landing gear bay in the front of the model.  I know Lego wants to stay away from military-themed kits, but a nice grey, white, and black brick palette would have looked much better than red, white, and blue. The issue with the front landing gear bay is also a minor detail, but if they had moving parts to close up the two rear landing gears, why not go the whole distance and include the same for the front?

I think when all is said and done, what little imperfections the kit does have, are more than made up for with the finished product.  I wouldn't say it's an incredibly detail kit, but the overall design is tight and it was a fun challenge to build.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2007-10-23T06:15:59.513Z","Fast Flyers Five!","What a great set infused with Technic parts to add touches of realism. This set is a great buy for 20 bucks. The main jet model is beautiful. Others have criticized LEGO for only having red, white and blue parts but this color combo works for me. The moving wings are by far one of the coolest designs I have come across using Technic parts (although I don't really collect/build with Technic). I haven't built the other models but they seem like fun to build as well. The hovercraft's design is curved which uses slope bricks to achieve this look. This set is worth buying just to learn how the wings move! The landing gear tucks away underneath the body of the plane which is a nice touch as well. Looks great on display!

"trumpet4751","2008-06-30T12:28:36.92Z","Not Quite Up To Expectations","The Fast Flyers Set looks great on the box, but it was a little dissapointing. In some places it's poorly built, and it fell apart several times during construction. However, it's makes a pretty good set once it's built. The landing gear is an excellent feature, and moving flaps and wings are very cool. The colors are nice, too. It is great to play with, but it quikly gets boring. The set is only twenty dollars which is great for over 300 pieces! So it's not quite as good as I hoped, but in the end it's an okay set. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"VideoGameLord613","2008-07-19T14:57:12.543Z","Very good","This is a set that you can press the button on the tail and the wings move! 
Pros:
Wings move
Can switch the wheels

Cons:
Not really any

At least a 95/100%


Well, See you around for more reviews!

"Techman","2012-06-17T14:40:03.453Z","Great display model with nice functions","With its release in 2007, I was captivated by this model because it resembled an f-14 tomcat fighter jet to me. The swept wing feature was the main function on this kit and it was very interesting on how it worked. Inside the body of the aircraft, the back lever you pushed forward moved two links forward also to push the wings back on hinges. There are a good use of those swiveling plates to help the wings smoothly slide back into position. The landing gear and wing flaps all work like a real plane except for the rudder which isn't on this model. That's no big deal because this kit packs a lot of nice pieces to help you in your model parts. It it a sweet display model with its color scheme of strips that make it look awesome. I personally have mine on a custom stand that makes it look great when you look at it. The wings can be positioned at several angles to make it look different each time. Like most creator models, there are other booklets to build a hover craft and other model. The kit for its release was at a great price for it piece count. Originally it sold for $20.00. I got mine at a retail store on it's release. I love the old creator models for their unique mechanisms. This model has technic parts too which I've now added to my collection of pieces. To conclude, this set is a nice display model and is a great set for pieces. Go grab one now, you won't be disappointed.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,4,4,4
"zipsforbananas","2013-05-24T07:03:34.253Z","My dark-ages model - and it's easy to see why!","<p>Building this model with a nephew at Christmas brought me out of my dark ages. The way it captures the shape of a fighter plane so well, the swell of the body, the angle of the wings, it reminded me just how brilliant Lego can be.<br>And that's all very fair to say of this set. Looking at other plane sets, particularly subsequent creator sets, this is a real gem of a set, a diamond in the rough. It's its wonderfully compact nature with every part feeling totally coherent to the whole that makes it shine.</p><p>The build is good fun. There are no especially difficult advanced techniques, but the Technic mechanism for swinging the wings out, the Technic parts in the engines and the layering of plates in the wings give a great amount of variety. I found it very easy to remember with everything being coherent and quite enjoyed pulling it apart and trying to build it from memory and build it different ways (front to back, top to bottom, in sections, etc).</p><p>The parts are nice for what it is, but are naturally limited. You get a lot of inverse blue slopes and curves, not as much red as you'd expect, and plenty of white wing pieces. But as with the build, the Technic sections give you some interesting pieces, and the cockpit pieces are nice.</p><p>The real strength of the set is how it looks and how swooshable it is. As I've been saying from the start, it all comes together really well. The main fault of other Lego planes, and certainly the self builds I used to make when I was young, is how parts can seem disconnected and awkward. This set doesn't suffer from that at all. It looks fast and sleek and begs to be swooshed around the room!&nbsp;It's a great size for that too, big enough to feel substantial, but not so big it's cumbersome.<br>The functions are great too. The landing gear is the only real fault I can find. The front wheel folds up a little too easily when wheeling it around as they don't get all that far back from vertical. And the flaps covering the back wheels feel flimsy, why Lego didn't use a double clip I don't know, and the suggestion of an extra piece a few reviews below that will make the wheels pull the flaps up seems nice, though I imagine if the wheels are touching the brick when retracted it might damage the rubber of the tyres eventually. (The rear wing flaps are also a little annoying, only being attached by one Technic pin, so they rotate a little too easily.)<br>The real triumph is of course the retracting wings. Pushing and pulling them closed and open is really pleasing, the mechanism is well hidden, and the different positions you can put the wings in make displaying it really easy. I moved one of the Technic bushes to the other end of the mechanism to stop the wings opening all the way, it looked a bit faster to me!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Superb looks, sleek, fast and compact</li><li>Great wing function, giving tonnes of playability and options for display</li><li>Overall integrity and coherence - it's as durable as it looks</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A few little niggles with the landing gear flaps and rear wing flaps on the engines being a little flimsy</li></ul>
<p>A really superb set, that looks fantastic, is fun to build, and doesn't disappoint when you have the finished model. My nephew loved swooshing it, I loved sticking it on the coffee table and seeing it there. It's pretty good value too, so if you ever have the chance to pick one up I'd recommend it.<br><br>(I've just realised I've not mentioned the alternative models. It's quite obvious that's what they are though, the hovercraft is cleverly made but it's obvious it's using something else's parts, and the helicopter is better, but there's a lot less to it. You can try building them to see what you think, but you will always come back to the plane!)</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
