The main model is more sturdy than the one in 4416, and the blue and white elements included are nice for Space builders: Plenty of 1 x 1 white and trans-blue sloped tiles, a white 2 x 4 wing, a 2 x 2 white dome without printing, and some other more common (yet useful) elements to make the icing on the cake.

For what this set is (A small robot building kit), it can't get much better than it is (Except for the new grays, but we have to live with that). Good overall value. I have to give it a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

i like this one more than i expected: it consists of basic colours and a lot of standard/basic parts. the main model has a turnable upper body and is overall quite big. the 2 alternative models are also very cool, one robot with a big claw and a technoid animal-like robot, both ingeniously invented and definitely worth building. i recommend it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Because of this the main model looks very well made and is a little larger than I expected.It has no trouble standing up and can even stand on one leg. I mostly bought this for a parts pack it contains 8 of those &quot;1&quot; by&quot;1&quot; slopes a white dome and an assortment of clips and studs. For being a flawless model this set is deffiantly a 5out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-30T14:39:45.45Z","Mini Robots","This Mini Robots set was fun to build and I was surprised to see how the main model was designed. There are many points of articulation including the waist, hips, knees, and arms. The main model had a gun to defend itself from other robots. This is a terrific set to buy as a parts set. Many cheese slopes are included (6 white, 2 trans blue), a dome, 2 &quot;telephone&quot; 1x3 bars in drak gray, and 2 white Bricks 2 x 1 x 1 &amp; 1/3 with Curved Top. This set also has a lot of 1x1 plates with clips and 8 translucent pieces in all. Worth the money just for the parts, consider the instructions a bonus! For my 1st robot set, I have to say that I can see building more robots in the future even though I am a town/city fan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

A great 4.5/5, for the price ($5 for 77 pieces??? UNHEARD OF!) and the play (Rebuild this three times, its like three in 1, but that's most Creator sets for you). Pros and Cons, here they come...

Pros:
1. Each robot has moving arms and legs
2. All robos gots guns! BAM!
3. The second has a pinching claw (Still only $5)
4. Easy build for the younger LEGO fans

And those pesky cons:
1. What the heck is the third robot anyways?
2. Second Robot's center piece causes the top to come off easy
3. Claw doesn't really pinch all of the way

Parents: Your child will most likely love this set if they are under 10. It is fun, creative, and the helps your child ponder on the interesting idea of a LEGO robot in the palm of their hand.

I recommend this set to anyone who can find it! Go mini robos!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The color scheme is right on, classic: white, blue, and red eyes. Very nice.<br></li><li>-The little wing things, the gun, it all just works. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The feet do seem a bit large considering the size of the model, but it still looks all right. <br></li><li>-The little red pieces would have also been nice in the model, but it's very unfortunate that they are hidden in the front. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This little set is adorable, and very well made. It's cheap, and puts some nice simple and common bricks into your collection. I recommend it to everybody.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
