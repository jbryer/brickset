"_whateverist","2007-12-19T17:01:24.06Z","Small but very neat","This Creator set comes in a very convenient, resealable plastic shell that holds all the bricks and the manual, making it perfect to take along and to keep the spare bricks together.
The set has the materials and instructions to make three separate models, each one using the majority of the bricks. While all models are adequate, the quality goes down as you reach the end of the instruction booklet - from a great helicopter, to a solid jet, to a fragile biplane.
The helicopter model is definitely the focus of the set and it's a beauty. Resembling a large Search And Rescue chopper, it has many details that, while abstract, are easy to recognize: the &quot;winch&quot; over the side loading &quot;door&quot;, the high cockpit, the pontoons holding the landing gear - they're all rendered in only a few bricks but easy enough to pick out. The proportions of this model are great, as is the colour scheme.
The jet fighter is a more streamlined design, using fewer of the large bricks. Again, there are little touches like the air intakes near the wings and detailed engines by the tail that make this more than a few bricks slapped together. 
The biplane really feels like an afterthought in comparison. While the details are again there - like the tiny &quot;pilot&quot; behind the windscreen - the proportions are not very convincing and some parts, like the floats, snap off when you look at them funny. The colours don't help either.
Overall though, â‚¬5 for two great designs and one mediocre one is great value for money and there's enough matching bricks in the set to get creative. I can gladly recommend this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Little did we know it would spark the rekindling of my desire for Lego.  My old sets are long gone, but this set, despite not having any minifigures, kept me occupied during my recovery time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TinyHippo","2008-09-09T16:30:15.45Z","Great Set","A fine collection and spread of pieces, to start with. The three models are interesting makes with some vaguely innovative practices in them, but as another reviewer has already remarked there is plenty of room for using your own imagination to make other models on the move. The colour scheme is not particularly interesting or new, but it certainly works. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-12-30T14:52:52.297Z","Mini Flyers","I wanted this set when it was first released at the end of 06. I waited until the end of 07 to buy it for 50% off and my patience was rewarded with a nice set and great parts. The main model is almost perfect. I used the remaining parts and altered the tail to make a sturdier model. However, as the model is built using the directions, it is beautiful. The parts are great in this set as well. 4 total 1x1 slopes, a dome, clear slope, clear 1x2 plates, and 2 white 3x1 slope bricks. The jet model is a quality model but the biplane is just OK. Out of the 4 Creator Mini Models this is my favorite followed by 4915 Mini Construction. This is a great line for those of us looking for smaller elements and mini models. The first two from the 08 line are even better than the first time around. Good job in finding a successor to the x-pods line that was out in 2004-2006. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T13:15:58.81Z","very nice and fun!","this is a great set, it includes instructions for two other modles which are almost as good as the helicoptor. the helicoptor has lots of details, maybe even too much theres some parts that are just to much. the back and top blades spin fine and the winsheild looks good on it. the little slops on the bottom (i dont know what they are) look good and blend in well. the only thing i can think of that bad is when its sitting down it wobbles a bit but who care?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dddddd719","2008-06-29T15:27:41.437Z","Very good set","With this set you can build three models, a helicopter, jet plane and a biplane. The helicopter is a very good mini model that is very realistic. The jet isn't bad but I had to modify it to include guns. For a third model the biplane isn't to bad. overall this is a very good set and would definetly recommend it to anyones collection. 4.5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:56:57.857Z","A Couple Solid Models","This set has two solid models and one so-so model. The main model (helicoper) and third model (airplane) are fine, but I'm not a big fan of the jet model. The set has a decent red, white and black color scheme, with light grey accents. As cheap as this set is, there's nothing wrong with picking it up. Just don't expect a lot from it. I'd give the set an 80/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T15:56:37.07Z","The old helicopter set","<p>This was the original mini helicopter set which came &nbsp;out back in 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Helicopter is a very good model and&nbsp; has a nice propeller spinner which spins for a few seconds and some good&nbsp; details&nbsp; at the front and back too. The only con is the propellers are a bit flimsy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The jet model has nice detail and better than the new one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old timer plane is really nice and quite sturdy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this set is much better than the 2008 mini jet set and is a good purchase.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5
