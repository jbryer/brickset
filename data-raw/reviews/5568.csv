I wish it were just the car, so there were no misunderstanding. Or, had I known earlier, i would have gotten the other Ferrari Car #8362!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"faster345","2007-07-18T16:11:40.7Z","Nothing like #8362","From the official photos I thought this set would be similar to the previous pull-back Ferrari #8362 of 2004, but sadly it is not. The car from the side looks nothing like an actual Ferrari 248, it's very mis-shaped. I'm thinking of tearing mine down and using it for parts. May we have a more accurate Ferrari next time please? Cheers. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"adik_sa_lego","2007-12-08T01:15:01.89Z","i will have to disagree","This is by far, better than 8362 (i own both sets). It has more detail, is more fun to build, and is closer to the 1:24 ratio. I'd give it a 5 to raise the score, but the lack of a minifig brings it down to 4.65.

but then again, not using a minifig makes it look more realistic. i just hope they used a schumacher or a massa helmet instead of the generic red one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Xwing250","2008-06-20T04:08:55.78Z","Good Set, but disapointing!","When I first got this set i thought you would be getting a Massa or Raikonnen Minifigure but instead you get a head and a ordinary red helmet attached to the car itself! Not GOOD! Livery is good, I got the &quot;Shell&quot; (2007) stickers not the &quot;Vodafone&quot; (2006)ones.Good attention to detail. This is a great set although spoiled by such a little thing.
