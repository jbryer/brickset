"LEGOwen","2007-10-29T21:07:53.013Z","Never mind the stickers","I haven't really bought a LEGO set since I was a lot, LOT younger and, as I was a fan of the Model Team line, I thought that the relatively new 1:17 Ferrari sets were a good place to start. The F430 Challenge was the only set available in my local toy shop so, while I wait for my 430 Spider to turn up in the post, I figured I'd buy this model and have a crack at it.

To begin with, I found the build very enjoyable. Seeing the model come together and take shape was very pleasing. I particularly enjoyed finding out that, a third of the way into the build, it had its own &quot;handbrake&quot; -- a truly ingenious piece of LEGO engineering.

I had, however, heard about its multitude of stickers. Initially, I added a few stickers to the car's interior (gear box and display) but, as the build went on, I decided to hold back from applying them to see what the finished car would look like without the stickers. Apart from missing the &quot;14&quot; from the bonnet and the roof, I don't think it looks too bad. In fact, using a little bit of LEGO engineering, some of the stickers can be replaced with actual building.

What the huge sheet of stickers (which were unfortunately crumpled inside the box) highlighted to me was the lack of brick printing. The 1:17 Enzo Ferrari that LEGO produced in 2005 had printed front lights and I think that the Challenge (and the Spider) would have benefitted from this. I know that LEGO produced a new element for use as the wheel arches on the Enzo, but I feel that for the Spider and Challenge they would have been better off producing a double-width version with the lights actually printed on. In fact, there were a few tiles on the rear of the vehicle that could have done with printing as well. I understand that this would have been an expensive thing for LEGO to do, but it would have made the final model look much tidier.

As far as I'm concerned, I feel that a sheet of stickers should be there to add further detail to the model, but only if the builder wishes to. Personally, I plan to leave most of the stickers off, but only because I think that they don't necessarily add anything to the model. Like I said at the end of the third paragraph, a lot of it can be made to look better with actual rebuilding -- especially the front air intakes -- although some interior elements can also be replaced to keep the model relatively sticker-free.

Apart from this minor quibble, I really rate the F430 Challenge as a genuinely decent LEGO model. There are a few other minor things that have been mentioned in other reviews, but otherwise it's nice to build something that actually ends up looking like more than just a LEGO model. Well done, LEGO. Truly great Danes!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It took quite a while to assemble this model. You can build two different color cars however I have not had the desire to take most of it apart and switch it to yellow. The stickers are a drag, I put on a few and kept the rest on the page - you will tear them up if you ever disasemble the car - what are they thinking ? Nice set I do like it but would never have paid the original retail price for it. Lots of cool parts, interesting to build, not designed for younger lego fans, instructions can be hard to follow at times. Overall a good set challenging to build - dosen't fit into your city/town system to big!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2009-07-29T07:53:28.483Z","Stickers are now peeling off!","As I predicted in some of my earlier reviews the problem with stickers is not only getting them on in the first place, but also that with age they deteriorate. It has now been two and a half years since I made this set and as I feared the stickers, which add to the look of the car by making some of the shapes, are coming off. They begin to curl at the edges where attempts to stick them down again fail. They then begin to go brittle where any further contact causes them to disintegrate. This has spoilt the whole look of the car and made the effort of applying them carefully a waste of time. This is not the only Lego set I have totally ruined by the disintegrating sticker syndrome. 

If anyone from LEGO reads this CAN YOU PLEASE STOP USING STICKERS, OR AT LEAST CHANGE THEM SO THEY LAST A LITTLE LONGER.

Pros:
Strong license
Multiple builds, yellow version
Great wheels

Cons:
Roof isn't fixed
Stickers
Stickers
Did I mention stickers
Cost

After putting this together it makes me want 8653, the 1:10 Technic Enzo Ferrari.  It seems more up my alley.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
