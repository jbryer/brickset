I got it new in the box on ebay a few years back and have loved all of the things you can get out of it.  The rotating turret on the rear half of the vehicle is totally awesome.  I take the arms off of the front part when i use it as a tank because they swivel when you drive it forwards. Overall it doesn't really have any bad parts about it, besides the loose hinges.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Awesome set, reccomended for space lovers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
