"AndreasL","2008-08-06T22:44:54.14Z","Too many stickers","I got this set cheap of eBay. It is easy to build and includes a lot of playability. However, there are just too many stickers. I did spend more time applying stickers than actually putting bricks together. This set clearly holds the sticker record in my Lego collection. So this is not a very fun build in my opinion, thus the relatively low score from me. Otherwise the set is good and comes with some very useful base plates and pieces if it should ever be taken apart for other projects.
