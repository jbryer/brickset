"CyandraZ","2007-06-17T13:02:31.2Z","This one's a surefire winner!","Aquaraiders is probably the best theme of the January 2007 lineup, and this kit tops all the others. Why? Simply because virtually lego fan will enjoy this set if they purchase it. First off, the parts per piece ratio is better than average, and virtually every piece is very useable. The yellow curved slopes, robot arms, trans green seaweed, and printed tail are the highlights, and the kit has lots of accessories (Beautiful divers helmet and snorkel, dark gray oxygen tank, flippers, 2 harpoons, treasure chest, two gems, 4 coins, a skull, and two red snakes). The model itself is a beauty, since it is a perfect melding of classic and modern building techniques. The sub is clever and sleek, and the plant structure looks like it came right out of the Divers theme. Finally, the figure is amazing! A modern version of a Diver figure, with cool printing on the torso and helmet and a cool color scheme! Overall, this kit is literally perfect. I couldn’t expect anything more from a $5 USD kit, and I highly recommend it to all adult, teen, and kid fans of Lego alike! 5/5 – Perfect!

P.S. Although many people dislike the color change, I really think it works great with themes like Starwars and Aquaraiders – it’s a lot more metallic or stone looking! ;)

"legozander","2007-07-05T14:35:26.2Z","A package of fun","This is my first (and only) aquaraiders set. I really like it.

The minifig in the set comes with a cool diving suit with a neat little design on it. I like the colour of his visor as well.

The little jet scooter I really like. It even has two black robot arms from Exo-Force! The're handy for grabbing those sea-snakes... :P
 
On the subject of the sea-snakes their nothing new. Funny, I never knew sea snakes came with rattles....

The dark grey rock is nothing interesting. I like the seaweed bit on it. On the box the seaweed looked like a solid green colour to me, but when I opened the set it turned out to be see-through green!

The treasure chest is a nifty little thing. I quite like it.

The treasure is cool. You get four gold coins, two gems and- a skull? Yeah, very valuable. LOL. :P
So overall this is a great little set and it is well worth getting. I recommend it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"David1985","2007-11-29T00:34:02.403Z","Great Cheap Set!","75 Pieces
$4.99

Overall Set...

Pieces…

There are 75 pieces for only $5. With the 75 pieces you get two red snakes, a blue and green jewel, a skeleton head, and 4 gold coins. The front have two robot arms with “wrench” pieces to pick things up with. There is a trans-green seaweed piece. You can never get enough of those.

Minifig…

The minifig is nice. A printed helment with a nice light blue, black yellow mix for the overall minifig. I guess the head is an old one, but I like it. I see no need for Lego to make special characters for themes like Knight’s Kingdom and Exo-Force. Lego until 15 years ago just had the simple smilie face and they worked fine. All the Aqua Raiders have the same diver suit too, so you can make a little army of them, but that might displease some.

Special things…

NO STICKERS! I will repeat NO STICKERS! There is a computer tile and a back fin that says Sub Deep Diver. It’s great to not have any stickers.

When you see this set, buy it! Buy two of them!

"Blade","2007-09-04T01:27:00.253Z","A Tru Little Ripper","Well i bought this set over a week ago and it took me a few days to get around to building it and this long to review it. :( 

Well lets start with the name, Aqua Raiders. Very nice and cant be confused with the Aquanauts. The price was the thing that stunned me. like $6 at the local K-Mart. This set is of fair size and a fair few pieces.

The sub itself is awesome. the shape size and detail of this model truly stuns me and i feel the box dose not do it justice. The vehicle itself is very aesthetically pleasing with nice shapes and curves and features everywhere like: It has moving claws at the front which are perfect for catching the sea snakes or picking up the treasure chest or holding the spear guns. 

Dual Front Lasers, Spear guns which attach so nicely to the side of the vehicle making them practical not just shoved somewhere. The control panel is on a hinge, which is great for the position of the mini-fig. Flippers attached in a good accessible spot, The tail fin is printed not stickered so extra points there and it even has a rudder, which works nicely considering it is only attached by one clip.

The mini-fig is blue and black all over and they have even put colour detail into the figs back which is very uncommon. He has an oxygen tank so a mask with a snorkel dose seem a little stupid but the colour is appropriate so I can over look that.

As for the extras The small ground piece was a good addition and i know the treasure chest doesn't fit on it but its an extra! Consider the model without it? Also I feel they were trying not to make it too much like the piece from set 6555. The sea snakes are nice yes could have used a bigger animal but they did give us two. The treasure chest has a nice combination of crystals and gold which is what treasure chests always should have been. The skull is for good measure.

Overall I feel there really nothing you can complain about with this set. Ok bigger animal, better ground piece, extra fig, but that would make it a $15 - $20 model and really if you just got the sub it would still be worth the $6 so dont complain. For such a small model I cant believe it is so good and really it is flawless so I feel for once a small model truly deserves a 10/10 boarding on an 11 because that is just how impressed i am with this model and coming from an old school fan that is saying something. Who ever you are, What ever you play with or collect, get this one just because it is so worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I was a little annoyed that I could have just bought it at a store but it is a nic small set. The minifig is detailed, there is a snake and translucent green plant part, a treasure chest filled with coins, crystals and a skull and the vehicle is cool too. The use of technic beams and axles to attach the propellers to the vehicle are cool. Even the tiny sets are incorporating technic parts. The yellow slopes at the front of the vehicle are nice parts. I can't believe I passed up this set when it was on clearance for 98 cents at Target. I went back the next morning to buy the 4 that were on the shelves and they were gone.

"Gus_263","2008-06-15T12:37:29.67Z","Easy to build and play","This set was from the last year (2007), and was one small set from aqua raiders theme, a new version of the aqua zone theme, but with many differences in many things. But these differet things don't frustrated the theme at all, and this is one of the cool sets that have something to looks like with the classic aqua zone. 

The set basically includes a scenery, vehicle, the minifigure, treasures and two snakes to increase the scenery, altough these snakes can't moves. The scenery is basically a piece to looks like with seaweed, used too as other plants on other sets, in themes under the sea or above the ground. This piece is located above a glowing dark green cone piece and next to grey bricks and ramp pieces above a gray plate. The treasure chest contains one skull, four coins and two gems, one blue other green, and the two snakes are red. The minifigure have dive accessories, and the colors and printed details on this makes this useful for sets in water environment, but the colors aren't that great, and were very repeated on this theme. 

The vehicle too includes different pieces like the special plates to keeps some pieces with claws that can hold things like the minifigures' hands, those pieces that were used as the arms of the exo-force's robots. A special plate too located on the center of the vehicle keeps two plates at one side and ramp pieces on the front of the set. Is easy see two black plates between the ramp pieces and the &quot;arms&quot;, and these are very next to the other plates. 

Two harpoons are placed on the vehicle by claw pies on the sides, and these are useful too as tools. On the left and right of the set, have some pieces like the glowing blue ones connected by pieces common on technic sets to propellers and too the main part of the vehicle. This have also a control panel that can moves to the minifigure, placed very well on the set. On the back of the vehicle keep placed plates with sticks to keep a black piece and in the left of the set, another accessories. The logo of aqua raiders is printed on the back of the set, and this is useful basically for yellow or underwater sets. 

This set is easy to build and have the playability of the aquazone sets, where are minifigures can dive with or without vehicles, searching for treasures. The colors are too repetitive, but something on them are cool. The arms on the front can be considered as innovations, but any minifigure in the original shape can hangs something like they. This in overall deserves a 4.6 of 5. It have 75 cool pieces and is very playable, a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
My first Diver maskpiece, fins and tank!
My first seaweed piece!
I don't exactly have a lot of green crystals, so this helps with the treasure!
Excelent design!
Cons:
The whole series has too many minifigures, and the whole series uses only four characters! There must be at least 3 of this diver's heads in the Aqua Raider's series!
Snakes... pointless. You can't really get them to get into the claws and stay there.
You have to take off the fins off the back of the scuba, and the harpoons, to get him into his actual diver form. Can't he be hanging off the back with some handles, like in some other sets? I already remade this set to do that, and it looks much better!
Skull is hard to have in the closed treasure chest with treasure.

However, it does offer a small range of technic pieces, which is uncommon for a set of its size. There is a small rock structure included in the set, which is rather common in the Aqua Raiders theme. It consists of a few bricks and slopes of varying grays, and a bit of seaweed. Unlike other rocks in this series, however, there is no treasure to be found on it. The treasure itself is contained entirely in a chest, which is delightful. The contents of the chest include a skull, two gems, and a handful of chrome gold coins.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

The aforementioned technic pieces form the propeller shafts and a torpedo-looking structure. Between the propellers, a rudder is formed with a small quadrangle-esque flag, which is a technique that is rather common in this theme. There are two hooks which are used for the storage of the diver&rsquo;s swim fins, and this is a very nice addition to the set. At the front of the vehicle, there are two small manipulator arms, which I would often use to keep the sea snakes at bay when I played with this set.

After years of use, the tan frictionless pin that they are attached to has started to warp, and because of this, the propellers no longer spin freely.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

It has a vehicle, a bit of environment to add to the playability, treasure, and sea snakes. It isn&rsquo;t overly complex, and offers a lovely selection of parts and creatures. The minifig is the archetype of the Aqua Raiders theme, and is accompanied by a decent amount of detail on the torso. </span></span></p>
