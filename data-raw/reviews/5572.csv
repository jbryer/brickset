"omgbrick","2007-02-16T21:10:03.36Z","Sweet but small","When I built it I found the angler fish was smaller than expected though all of the sea creatures seem to be smaller.For about 14 canadian this set is still good as it gives you two fully equipted divers(flippers harpon guns hemets and air tanks)along with a small and a small water vechile  along with a jack hammer the rock thing works well and so do the glowing fangs on the angeler fish only problem is that you can't carry the second diver or coins on the small vechicle 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2007-06-17T13:03:33.327Z","Love the fishy, along with everything else!","Angler Ambush is another Aquaraiders must buy. Priced at $10 USD, it contains more than enough pieces, two figs, and an awesome monster! For a constant MOC’er, this kit is a goldmine. 2 yellow curved slopes, 2 black and 2 blue triangular fins, lots of dark blue and blue wedged and curved slopes, trans green seaweed, 2 glow in the dark dino tails, and 8 Viking horns are only some of the wide variety of pieces included. The kit also has two full sets of diving gear (1 set includes a helmet and snorkel, oxygen tank, 2 flippers, and a harpoon), plus a jackhammer, lasso, and 4 coins, - a very nice accessory assortment if you ask me! As for the final models, boy are they cool! The sub is small but very neat, and the angler is amazing! It’s incredibly fearsome, and the printed face is beautiful! (in a scary kind of way). The rock with the flip-off panel is simple, but I like it – it reminds me of the cool play-features the Divers line had. Finally, the two figures are standard Aquaraiders figures (they have different heads though), and again I must say I love the modern spin on the Diver’s figures. So, overall, this kit is everything I hoped it would be, and I can’t find anything wrong with it! Thus, I highly recommend it! 5/5 – Perfect!

P.S. Although many people dislike the color change, I really think it works great with themes like Starwars and Aquaraiders – it’s a lot more metallic or stone looking! ;)

my son doesn't care about this zoological irregularity, he just loves the fish, probably because of its scary appearance, and ignores the rest of the set. anyway, a nice set thats worth the money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set has alot of playability with things for the guys to do while they watch out for the creatures of the deep.

But the truth is $9.99 is simply not enough to have more than 1 sub or creature. I would have rather seem lego made this set just an angler fish(then they could have made it bigger and more detailed) If this is the only aqua raider set you plan on getting, then it's an excellent set for you.

"Shadow_Crawler","2008-05-24T21:27:57.547Z","Fishy and Coins","Box = 5/5
Really nice, featuring the diver drilling for the coins while the angler attack the sub.

Building = 4/5
Quite good, but I'm disappointed that the &quot;tail&quot; of the fish only have one side decorated, the other side is blank.

Playbility = 5/5
VERY NICE! You can snap the fish's mouth, enjoy 2 glow-in-the-dark fangs, and blow the rocks apart to reveal the coins with the lever.

Pros :
NO STICKERS AT ALL!
Nice glow-in-the-dark fangs
Blow the rocks apart with the lever

Cons :
The fish's face is pretty strange for me

"legoguysw","2008-03-28T14:16:25.293Z","Not brilliant, but still a great set.","This is the only Aqua Raiders set i have, and it wll be the last. Not because of this set though, but because i have no real use for them.
The angler is great, GLOW IN THE DARK TEETH! Lego misunderstood, the part of an angler that lights up is the light, but still, its cool. At least it has the light. The eyes are PRINTED, yay, this set has no stickers if i remember correctly. The fins work well, they don't come off easily. 
The sub scooter is a smaller version of the one in Deep Sea Treasure Hunter. I managed to change it so that the pilot could sit down. The sub scooter holds two harpoon guns, and spare flippers go on the back. There are two air tanks on the sides.
The minifigures look great, highly detailed and fun. The helmets and goggles look cool, and the flippers are a plus. The one fig has a drill!
The rock has a secret compartment, push on a lever, the lever pushes up the top of the rock, revealing a hole with four gold coins. The rock also has a a seaweed thing. One CON in this set is that there are small holes in the sides of the rock the coins can drop through, one fixable with the seaweed, and for the other you'll need to take a dive into your brick box.
Overall, a great set, I'd like to see more of this kind of set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Obi_Wan9994","2008-06-18T09:56:59Z","Escape With The Treasure!","I got this set because I wanted something new, and I must say, I'm impressed.

Pros:
2 mini figs. Divers with cool diver gear, one with a drill
Angler fish. Move able fins, opening and closing jaws, glow in the dark fangs(cool if you lay with your legos in the dark), nice pieces, good playability.
Mini-sub. LOVED it. Fantastic Playability, small, light weight, good pieces, an asset to this set. 
Rock. nice working catapault hides gold pieces
Affordable
Great playability. Fun to share and play with others.

"asianlego","2008-09-29T12:20:02.92Z","Attack from the Deep","I have never gotten the previous Aquazone sets so I took the chance to try out something similar with the new Aqua Raiders set. 

The Rock/Treasure Trove
-The rock is nice and even has a lever which if pressed flips off a piece, revealing a stash of coins inside. (How coins are formed inside rocks I have no idea)

The Yellow Dive-Scooter
-The scooter is cute and uses many unique yellow pieces. The rear tailfin of the scooter a trident logo on it with the words 'SUB DEEP DIVING'. They are all printed, which is cool because I hate stickers.

The Two Divers
-One of them is a young man and the other is an older, more seasoned and experienced diver.
-They both wear the same uniform, the same goggles, and they both also come with oxygen packs.

The Fish
-Err.. I didn't build the fish because I really hate building Lego animals so I created a large dive-scooter like the yellow one, except that there is a place at the back where the small yellow scooter can park and detach. 

All in all, I would say that you get this set if you haven't gotten either Aquazone or any of the Aqua Raiders set because it would be great to have this set.

The angler-fish looks very scary with all the teeth and the 2 teeth which glow in the dark. The fins are all movable and on the top is a whip piece which has a transparent yellow cone on it. This fish looks much smaller than the new angler-fish which I've seen in the new Atlantis set from 2011 (It's set 7978) but I can't really compare them because I don't have set 7978 yet. The yellow jet of the diver is very small and I think it's a little bit too small because the diver is going to die because he only has harpoons as weapons. The last thing we get is a pile of rocks with a plant. The cool thing about the rocks is that there's a lever which you pish to make an explosion effect.
