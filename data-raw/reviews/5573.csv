"Takeshi","2007-03-04T16:34:59.573Z","nice set","This set is pretty interesting. It has a drill vehicle with a hand, and a sweet lobster, though the leg pieces fall off. Comes with two cool aqua-blue crysatals.

Nice set.
recommended for sea-theme lovers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-07-10T20:04:33.747Z","OK Set","This is a decent set

Pros-

cool rover w/ blade and hand
good minifigs:)
minifigs have accessories
lobster has neat claws

Cons-

flimsy lobster legs and cockpit on the rover
a bit too much on the price ($20.00?)

Overall a pretty good set however worth $15.00 to me. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-08-07T20:15:34.77Z","One weak Lobster","This set by it self is just plain odd looking First off lets start by reveiwing the human fraction off the set it includeds two minifigs one with full diving gear (flippers helmet air tank harpoon gun the other just has a hat the vehicle loks odd but intersting at the same time due too the huge arms the arm with the hand is three fingeredand holds the crystal well the treads are small but could be used for a one person tank or a half tread vehicle but still there is huge gaps in it so the operator would probaley drown. The lobster's legs are just so weak playabilty is crippled the dark red tips fall out every time you pick it up other than that however it looks preaty cool and acurate to a real lobster( just not supersized ) and uses new pieces around the head they and the crystals can probaly be usefull for Mocing. Still its a decent set 4/5 ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-19T12:05:37.547Z","not the greatest.","this is a very odd set. it has a fair share of pros cons

robo arm
harpoon gun

tank aint airtight 
 tank is cramped
lobster dosent flex too well

overall buy it only if u love aquaraiders",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-30T19:45:53.403Z","Really Random","That is the only way I can describe it. The lobster is way too big and the size of it looks like a real lobster. The cockpit should be airtight also. This set is really random, but if you like it, don't listen to me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"legoguy2805","2010-01-24T11:52:20.107Z","What?! The picture doesn't show the laser on top!!","I got this set for christmas 2009, and it is my first intact Aqua Raiders set. There are two things wrong with the set picture: The vehicle has a double laser on top, which has been edited out for some reason, and the set includes TWO crystals.

Pros:
Aqua raiders vehicle with drill, claw and lasers
Another Aqua raider with a harpoon
Lobster
Rare colour of crystals (medium blue)
No stickers!

Cons:
Lobster's feet fall off CONSTANTLY, massive con
Massive holes underneath the windscreen in both sides of vehicle, which surely would allow water to flood in and drown the pilot

Overall, 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-16T19:45:41.11Z","Nothing much to it","This set is very unusual. The lobster should be red, not black. Also, it is too flimsy, especially at the joints that allow the legs to bend, sometimes the small legs collapse under the weight of the oversized crustacean. The vehicle is average, includes a saw, arm to hold jewel, and treads. The length of the vehicle's arms can cause it to tip over if you're not careful. Lastly, there is driver and diver with arpoon. Overall very boring set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Lego_Guru","2008-11-14T18:50:29.763Z","Unusual but Cool","First of all it is a very unusual set because I have never seen a car with arms before but I guess it is cool. The lobster is awesome( finally printed
 pieces!) esecially with its snapping claws. I'd have to say that this model is really worth it's money and I gave it a 5/5 because of it's different design( and chrystals).  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-08-31T16:09:42.31Z","why are we trying to steal crystals from the power miners team? - diver","by the way the crystals in this set are the same as the ones in power miners sets

figures
pros: the diver is rare, the driver can only be foundn in this set
cons: none

rover
pros: cockpit can open, arms are posable, gun on top (not shown in the picture) can turn, saw can turn
cons: cockpit is not 100% airtight

lobster
pros: very posable
cons: none

pieces
pros: crystals, saw, cockpit window
cons: none

build
pros: sort of easy, rover is strong
cons: lobster is weak

price
pros: worth it
cons: none

I recommend this set to any aqua raiders II fan

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-03T04:17:23.847Z","LEGO Aqua Raiders - Lobster Strike Review","This is my largest set of the LEGO Aqua Raiders theme I have. It comes with a huge lobster, a luminous blue crystal which we've seen in the LEGO Rock Raiders and LEGO Power Miners theme a lot and an atv. This set comes with two divers. One comes with his full gear and the other one has a little hat piece.<br><br>The set was fun to build. I love the way how LEGO did the lobster. It's huge but not as huge as the LEGO Atlantis version from 2010. The atv is a little bit small but it has some lasers on the top of the windscreen. The only problems are that you have to sviwel the lasers if you want to open the cockpit and the other problem is that the cockpit isn't very closed. On each side you can see an arm which got pieces from the knight figures from the LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdoms II) theme. I think the second diver could have had a vehicle as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great model and I would highly recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"thejoker34","2010-02-28T18:13:18.733Z","Wait-does the humans eat lobster or does the lobster eat humans?","Great set. Got this a loooong time ago.

Minifigs-I won't go into detail, but their both 10/10, but they are nearly the same.

Aqua raiders vehicle-10/10. Wow. the laser cannon is awesome, especially with it's swiveling ability along with it's saw blada arm. It's a real nice little battle vehicle. It's not too big but it's a good starter.

Lobster-10/10-The arms are cool and the claws can shut and open. It's a cool enemy to play with always.

"Thistleforce","2012-03-17T16:51:50.213Z","Cool, with one major caveat...","<p>This set is the only Aqua Raiders set I own. I bought it because I like to build lego creatures, and the lobster is a unique-looking model.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: Blue crystals, and the lobster is composed of unique auto/car looking parts when viewed as stand-alone pieces. <br></li><li><br></li><li>Pro 2: Two separate models; the lobster was the main attraction for me, but the underwater vehicle is also a unique addition to my collection.</li><li>Pro 3: The lobster is moderately poseable...see Con 2.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: Major problem with the red lobster 'feet' falling off. While following the instructions, the feet aren't the last part to be put on either; and they are constantly falling out of place. My creature can't stand on his own legs and must rest on his belly!</li><li><br></li><li>Con 2: A lesser small problem limiting posability is that there is no Z-axis rotation on the shoulder joints for the arms with claws.</li></ul>
<p>The set is cool and has a lot of imaginitive play potential- except that it's all marred by the feet coming off the lobster. Maybe the saw on the sub cuts them off? <br></p>",TRUE,3,3,4,2,2
