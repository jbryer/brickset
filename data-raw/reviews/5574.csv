"Takeshi","2007-02-17T17:43:52.937Z","Let's go diving!","Excellent underwater set. About time the did an underwater series again. The only real complaint about this set is that the shark has an opening in the back of the head, but that is easily fixed. Nice sub, and I think that the idea to put the missile launchr there was cool, but it blocks the pilots veiw. The harpon turret is good, but a bit hard to pose. The crystals come in three colours, two of which I haven't seen as crystals.

Nice set, worth the money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-19T12:10:23.14Z","dive, dive, dive!","this is an awesome set with tons of accesories and usefull pieces and crystals. im gonna split my review into 3 main parts.

sub:
the sub has a nice futuristic fell to it and has 2 tirdents and a missile launcher. it also has good play value and is a decent size.

shark:
the shark is cool except his neck is uncovered due to the rotating piece but can be fixed. it too has nice pieces.

accesories/harpon turret.

i like the little rock setup that hits the crystals in a cool little bowl. the turret is hard to pose but looks terrific!

overall great set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"gvanrossum","2009-02-14T18:24:51.187Z","Got the last one!","This set is apparently discontinued, my wife got the last one at Toys-R-Us or some such place, and couldn't find another one for a birthday present.

Our 7yo son loves it, and built it with very little help. The sub is real cool looking, with a nice big gun. The shark is big and scary, and has many moving parts (jaw, fins, tail, tailfin, head).

Best part: no stickers!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-16T19:56:04.78Z","Pretty good","The best thing about this set is the shark, just look at its realistic details like eyes, streamlined shape, fins, movability, teeth, tongue and TEETH GUMS! The submarine has a driver, in the cockpit there is a computer and levers. The back has a motor and propellers, on the sides there are pipes attached to fuel tanks, and on the sides there are also tridents. The front center of the submarine has a missile lancher! The antenna is worthless, though. Set also includes diver with harpoon gun, and there is a gold dish with three jewels in it, one pink, one green and one light blue. Surrounding the jewel bowl is seaweed and three sloped tiles for the rocks. Overall great set, but it should come with an underwater base in which the submarine can be parked at. 17/20 ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-02-15T11:34:19.06Z","Pretty cool!","I didn't expect to get this set, and I didn't! For signing up for a certain Mag I received this set. Very cool indeed! For the year of which this set came out these pieces were rare and new! Like the sea weed, cannon, jewels, and the boll if I'm correct.
The shark was maybe the best sea creature Lego has ever made! With the movable jaw and fins, and the look of it, how could this thing be unresisting?
Onto Pros and Cons:

Pros:
- The best shark is the history of Lego! Large and scary! :p
- Two Aqua Raider signature minifigures.
- Aqua vehicle!
- Rare jewels and boll
- Mobile sea spear.
Cons:
Sharks jaw breaks off easily
- Building the Sea vehicle is tricky!

That's it!
Hope I could help. Although this set isn't being processed anymore! :(",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
