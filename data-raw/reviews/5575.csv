"noblesavage","2007-01-24T09:48:44Z","Buyers remorse...","At a hefty $49.99 USD I expected more from this set. There is a lot of wasted interior space, and I was most diappointed that there is room for only ONE mini-fig (and gear) in the center module. The aft module is dedicated to the engine assembly and for fore module is all missle. Not a fan of the crab either. There are a lot of useful yellow parts... guess I wish I had saved my money for the new castle sets this spring.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-13T14:48:14.827Z","5 star","I just got this and it's great. the crab is clever, but the legs won't hold him. The sea scooter thing is ok,but it won't fit inside the front with the harpoons. the treasure is 1 blue gem 1 yellow and 4 coins. the sub is great,the inside has gear,the controls,a seat, and a coffee cup, plus the engine. You know that bar thing behind the antennae and perisope? If you lift that up the robot commes out(the thing thats picking up coins in the picture). All in all a great set and must have for aqua fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-19T12:15:01.78Z","ive seen better.","this is an ok set but has a fair share of pros and cons

pros:
lots of yellow pieces
kind of a military sub
missile launcher
elephant rifle
coins and crystals
skelli

cons:
borin to build 
crab is kinda really lame
the space in the sub is kinda wasted 
only one guy allowed in the sub with equipment

could have done better:
they could have took some junk out of back of the sub to make room for people
crab could have been made better

not the greatest set",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"bricklord","2008-03-10T16:21:11.7Z","Not as cool as it looks on the box.","I got this set yesterday and put it together right away.<br>I'm not impressed.<br><br>Pros:<br>- many cool minifig tools (spearguns, jackhammer, hammer, wrench, airtanks, etc.)<br>- 8 spears (4 big, 4 small)<br>- the little robot thingy is cool (very appropriate for this kind of sub)<br>- a lot of yellow bricks (this is a good thing)<br>- the minifigs are very cool looking (I like their stubble and vests)<br>- the center interior is nicely designed (lots of room for gear and an engine)<br><br>Cons:<br>- the crab thing is just weird<br>- the little skeleton treasure seems superfluous<br>- I hate the ""firing missile"" in this set.<br>- too many loose moving parts on the outside<br><br>Overall, I kind of like this set but I see the need for some serious customization.  I plan on removing the missile to make room for storage of the second minifig and his little underwater thingy.  I'm also going to reinforce the tower on top, it needs it.",TRUE,3,5,2,3,2
"Rgijaba","2008-01-13T10:41:10.077Z","my second favorite aqua raider monster: the crab Crusher!","this is a great fifty doller lego!it comes with: a diver with astro pilots head, a diver with the dwarve kings head, a pirate skeliton with gun, a small robot water rover, and the crab crusher.i think the robot sub is a neat idea, and the robot sub is the aqua raider aretoo!the crab creshers legs move in all directions, but are a little delicate... but you can build the mutant manta ray if you combine it with the giant lobster!the sumerine as a un realyistly roomy inside; if it were real, it would have to be much, much smaller.but the inside is cool, and has some gear to make the guy in sub 21 a diver! sub 21 has a firing misle,and the neat little water scooter this comes with cant fit into the front of the sub like it shows on the box! but thats fine, the treasher barral is nice, and the sub is loaded down with fine details in both stcker and brick. in conclusion, this set is for all us aqua raider fans out there, and for ocean,umm, lovers...?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-02T09:00:24.983Z","Torpedo Tube 1 Away!!","Great set!  As my one and only Aqua Raiders set, it is definitely my favorite.  The big sub is bristling with underwater weapons, including (drumroll) the torpedo!!  The torpedo is pretty hidden away, but at the flick of a lever... Torpedo away!  Anyway, there is also a diver inside the sub with a coffee cup beside the controls (lol) and his full suit in the storage compartment.  The other diver has, well, something to pull him through the water.  The mini sub is a miniature robot with moving arms (I use it to sneak past the crab to get the treasure :D).  The skeleton is like the old skeletons, with the &quot;articulating&quot; arms that can flail in all directions, which makes it good for posing.  The crab can be difficult to pose, but once you get the hang of it, it's really fun to play with.  *Note: The little red brick underneath the green stalks on his head ARE NOT the eyes.  The eyes are at the top of each stalk, even though you can't see them.*
The rocks the treasure barrel is planted in are very realistic looking, and it's easy to slump the skeleton up against them beside the treasure.  Altogether, 5/5.

Pros:

-Sub has lots of weapons

-Crab looks cool and dangerous

-Torpedo!!

-Old skeleton

-Inside of sub is rather roomy compared to other Lego sets I can mention...

-Mini sub looks &quot;sneaky&quot;

-Periscope on top of conning tower

-Treasure barrel

-Rocks with seaweed

-Sub can split in two, and front part looks neat

Cons:

-Sub can disconnect to form two smaller ones, but the back one looks silly (the glass on the pilot's computer screen is all that's protecting him from going for an unplanned swim).  The front one, though, looks neat, so I can call the front part a Pro.

Altogether, great set, and as long as you don't split the sub, you're on your way to hours of undersea fun!!  Happy building!! :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Batmaniam","2009-02-19T13:32:18.34Z","Awsome Sub (by the way, its a blunderbus, not a shotgun)","My first, and only Aquaraider set, I wish that they had good guys in subs, and bad guys in subs, like they did with the Aqua sharks, back in the day. 
This set is very cool. It has everything I got it in Downtown Disney last year, I wanted to get some Indy sets, put last year they were selling really fast, so there weren't any, so I looked around, wanted to get the new police prison, but it was to big to fit in my bag for the flight home, so I settled on this one which is very nice just look at all the features:
-really cool sub
-harpoon guns
-tools(jackhammer, hammer, wrench)
-air tanks + hoses in the back
-floodlights
-spears
-little robot to get the treasure
lots of room inside, with racks, places to hold the equipment, chair, controls, cup of joe
-the top comes off, and the sides open up to get inside. little robot fits in back of the top (if you take the tope off it looks like it is partly submerged, and looks great in a harbour scene)
-motor in the back
-the front comes apart, for a mini sub, back half doesn't look too good when that is done, but a fun thing to do, is get another sub (maybe the tiger shark one, I just built an old aqua sharks one) and get it to fire a torpedo at it, and then take the mini sub off, and it looks like it exploded. very fun, and funny thing to do.
-and the best part: TORPEDO!! which is very well hidden, and lots of fun to shoot at unsuspecting people (hee hee)
Crab:
-legs are kind of unstable, and are hard to position
-big snapping claws
-looks scary from the front
Treasure:
-barrel with coins, and jewels
-seaweed, rocks
-old skeleton (the good kind)
-and very cool old  blunderbus gun, by the way it is not a shotgun, it is a blunderbus
Minifigs:
-nice, three of them, one skeloton, two divers, look at the picture to see them, printed on both sides of there torsos
CONS: 
legs are unstable, hard to position
-mini water scooter thing doen't fit in the front as advertised
-stickers, but some very nice printed on stuff on the crab
-thats all

Very good, fun set, if you see it get it. Kind of funny, second biggest set in the line, and it has the crab which is the second to the beggining on the  Lego food chain, the first is the snakes.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
