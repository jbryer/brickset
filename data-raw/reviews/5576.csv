"diverdan","2007-07-10T08:45:17.153Z","Cool set","I was supprised at the number of pieces in this set. There were a lot of pieces in new colors. 
Some things I liked in this set were...
-a lot of cool pieces
-the amazing detail of the  set(sub and squid used SNOT construction and the air tanks and diver gear in the base)
-the squid had a lot of glow in the dark pieces
- the sub has the more cargo room them any other aqua raider set (even 7774)
- the launching pad for the scooter sub thingy (uses a rubber piece so when you lift it up it springs back)
-I know the door on the side is unrealistic and if you open every one inside will drown, but I still like(it opens like and air plane door)
-you can put divers inside the squids clear belly(I was able to fit all 4 and the skeleton!)

Some things I didn't like were...
-the only mini sub that could fit through the tunnel is the one the set comes with(the others in different sets are the wrong shape)
-Only a plain clothed diver can fit in the sub(properly)
-the base plate is a little too small(the base hangs over the sides)

Aqua Base Invasion- 840 pieces $79.99 USD = great buy!

"wyoeaglefan","2008-01-18T11:26:11.623Z","Clearance?","I bought this set at Wal-mart last night for only $35. The base is well built and my son loves playing with the giant squid. The set is a great value for what you get, especially since I snagged it at 50% off. I will have to agree with some other reviewers about the baseplate. They should have used one of the cool raised baseplates they used in older base sets, like the orginal &quot;Aquazone&quot; base.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"rnychka","2009-01-04T13:58:08.967Z","The best command center?","This is a great set.  The build is interesting and not repetitive at all.  There are stickers, but they are not really needed since there are so many printed pieces and the color scheme is already so striking.

The command center is nice and open, and the use of tubes and air tanks is just great.  Nice detail even in the little levers and gauges.  It is clear that this command center is meant for working and the sea creatures are interfering. 

And the quick escape sled? Another great build. My son was totally focused building this and there were so many wows.   The command center base was perfect.  I generally do not like the raised plates, and it was nice to just have normal plates for the base.

There is also a great selection of minifigs here.

Octopus - cool skeleton, glows in the dark, and stable enough to stand on it's own

Mini-sub - realistic and it was nice how the instructions focused on this and the platform first.  It was immediate play time.  

It is really sad to see this line ended, it was such a good theme.

"Brickzilla64","2014-08-12T14:12:55.25Z","Possibly the best Aqua set LEGO has made!","<p>I got this for my birthday a few years ago, and WOAH. I realized I had a jewel of a LEGO set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Mine was an eBay order so I had no box. However I had the instructions, and they were good, but like most big sets, you still have to pay more attention to what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>This set has some of the coolest pieces I&#39;ve ever seen, from&nbsp;the GIANT windscreens, to the bars that hold the submarine platform up,&nbsp;the oxygen tubes, this set has everything!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>The Minifigs are pretty much normal Aqua Raiders, same parts except for the heads. However, if you&#39;re like me, then you made the older guy with the orange beard the &quot;Aqua Chief&quot; because he was the oldest, and then you have a character. The skeleton in the squid&#39;s head has ball joint arms, so that&#39;s a plus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>Wow. Just Wow. Whoever designed this is a genius. Everyone at LEGO is a genius, but this guy is a genius among genius&#39;s. It&#39;s one of the most elaborate, unique, and awesome builds I&#39;ve ever seen, or built. However, It&#39;s a little bit fragile, and the brick that holds the pieces that hold up the torpedo launcher will never stay. But it&#39;s awesome nonetheless. The Squid is amazingly built, but mine fell apart(probably my fault anyway). The submarine in this set is built well and&nbsp;is fun to build, extremely sturdy also.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;I must say few sets have a more satisfying feeling when your done building than this one does. I felt awesome after getting it done with, but I had a busy schedule around my B-day and it took me 2-3 days to get done. For younger or newer builders, I recommend&nbsp;you have someone help you. For older, more experienced builders, it&#39;ll still take you a few hours, but it&#39;s so fun to build, you won&#39;t care. But it&#39;s so fun to play with, you might care to finish quickly anyway!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>My favorite set of all time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, but getting your hands on one will be the hardest part, they&#39;re expensive and somewhat rare. Most AMAZING set I&#39;ve ever built!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
