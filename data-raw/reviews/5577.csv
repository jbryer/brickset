"diverdan","2007-07-11T11:05:04.84Z","Best aqua raider set ever","This set is my favorite aquaraider set. Its got every thing, a cool sub with guns on top, a &quot;shipwreck&quot;, loads of treasure, and skeleton and snakes. This is a cheap set considering you get a baseplate 7 gems, a set of gold coins, and a gold crown on the skeleton! There was only 1 thing I didn't like and that was there isn't much cargo room inside the sub( the diver sits so far back because of the cumputer thingy)but the size of the shipwreck makes up for that about 8 inches high! 

Shipwreck 241 pieces $24.99 USD= great buy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jellylikepie","2007-12-30T08:06:32.093Z","Good but could be better","This set if I were to rate it would be a 4.5/5 not 4/5 but to get on with the facts.

Pros:
5 harpoon guns.
2 water snakes (Green)
A crab (Yellow and can grip a Lego weapon etc in each hand)
7 different colored Gems or jewels (Blue, Red, Light Blue, Yellow, Green, Pink and Clear)
A set of money (4 coins with one of the following numbers on them; 10, 20, 30 or 40)
Side doors and cockpit window with open and close action.
Cool engines
Two harpoon shooters
A magnetic arm (Comes with two attachable magnetic safes.)
Small but cool mini sub
Two minifigs. (One with a divers gear one with just the Aqua Raiders torso and a cap.)
Two sea plants
A skeleton king. (Complete with crown)
Perfect sized base plate for the shipwreck

Cons:
The side doors keep falling off when I try to open them.
Stickers. (The sub 76, the safe covers, dangeer signs, and fuel are all stickers)


Overall:
I would pay about 30 bucks at most for this set. It is hard to find so if you want to make money you could buy it then keep it and sell it after its retired.

"shima55","2007-12-04T22:12:54.793Z","The theme needs more sets like this","A nice exclusive to the Aqua Raiders theme, with the focus more on exploration instead of combat. The backdrop feature should be implemented into future sets in the theme.

Pros:
Skeleton with crown
Nice Minifigures
Sub has airtight build
Strong magnets
Gold plate
Treasure
Green sea snakes
Shipwreck has good detail


Cons:
Sub is kind of flimsy
Arms are too thin
The shipwreck is very small
The driver is hard to position in the cockpit
The price is a little high
Stickers

Overall, this set is a very good addition to the theme, and it would be nice to see more like it.

"Stash","2008-10-03T23:39:06.263Z","What more could you want from this?","I have to say, this set is really the level of quality that I like to see from lego. 

What's in the box:

There are 3 bags of parts and 2 smaller bags inside those bags, the instructions, and a sticker sheet. The price per brick for this set is almost right on par with 243 parts (and I got a few extra) and a 25 dollar price tag. Lego has recently raised a few of their sets far beyond this price level in the star wars and castle sets (most notably the troll warship which costs almost 2 times what it should). This is where the price should be. 


Mini-figs:

This set has 3 figs and plenty of accessories. There are 2 divers, each with printed backs! Printed backs are fairly rare and the Aqua raiders series delivers on this consistently. The other figure is a skeleton king to go with the shipwreck. There are 7 gems, 5 spear guns, flippers, a scuba tank and helmet, a cap for the other figure, a crown for the king, and some odds and ends. The 2 minifigs have some nice unique/rare faces on them which is a big bonus. 


The shipwreck:

The build on this is very straightforward, fast, and easy. It comes out looking very, very nice, and would make a great addition to a shipyard (under construction) with some modification as well as being good for something at the bottom of the ocean. The plants look nice around it and it comes with a patch of sand for the ocean floor. The mast has a &quot;fall down&quot; action for when the figures try to steal the treasure. 


The sub:

A great, great vehicle. Again, a pretty straightforward and easy build. It has good weight to it, the doors are firm and well designed, and the spear gun apparatus on top is pretty interesting. That piece could be used in other builds easily. 


Overall impressions:

Not much more to ask for here. The set has great playability and lots of good pieces that have great value for re-use. Magnets are pretty rare pieces and this set comes with 3 of them. My sticker sheet came bent, but I will be taking that up with lego. 

The only things I would do differently are remove stickers in favor of printed pieces and change the instructions to add which parts are used for that page at the top (the way the 2007 hogwarts castle does). Instead of hunting to see what was added on the page, I can quickly see what will be used and where. It isn't hard to do this without that addition, but it certainly makes it faster.

This set earns an easy 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"CamberbrickGreen","2019-04-06T13:13:22.347Z","Nautical Gem In A League Of Its Own","<p>What a great theme Aqua Raiders is, so much fun and adventure with a hint of modern day piracy, pillaging treasure&nbsp;from wrecks. I find this an attractive range for play and collection, seemingly broadly popular. What&#39;s in the chest then?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>These are pretty neat divers, I am not in to hair prints for generic Lego people as it erodes the diversity of a piece for other builds but thats not a minus just a preference. The gear you get with these seems suitably high quality for their missions and the goggles are a fine touch. Note the bandit-like feel of the face, they are after all &#39;Raiders&#39;. Nice print too.</p>

<p><strong>Watery Grave Of The Lego King</strong><br />
The&nbsp;first construction is a mini-build of a wonderful little hand-held motor sub. I looked up these and they are called a &#39;DPV&#39; (diver propulsion vehicle) or a /sea scooter&#39;/&nbsp;&#39;underwater &#39;scooter&#39;. I think I always loved them since seeing James Bond diving scenes and similar as a&nbsp;kid. Actually Aqua Raiders look quite like Spectre as it happens. This excellent device has two harpoon guns and a headlight.</p>

<p>The centrepiece is a sandy and rocky affair. As reddish brown ancient timber&nbsp;bows begin to form around a trough, it really inspires&nbsp;some shipwright activity to build a large Lego vessel of old.&nbsp; The dangerous wreck has enough detail to tell you what it once was and its mast will collapse if the chest is slid away from it which is good fun. Gems and coins are filled in to the sea chest and a plate sits nearby attracting gold hungry raiders such as ourselves. A crab and sea snakes potter&nbsp;about among the weeds while sitting there in his shiny gold crown is a dead Lego king. Which king was this and why did he sink? Did Lego skulls always look this scary? No, I can confirm they used to be... happier! Its worth highlighting that the range of pieces in this set is lovely, the gear, the treasure, the colours, what&#39;s missing?</p>

<p>Now the scene is set, the sub can be built and I have to reference the film &#39;The Abyss&#39; as a fan of any bubble cockpit&nbsp;vehicle that gives great vision yet leaves the pilot feeling mildly vulnerable. It&#39;s actually pretty small but is so nicely made with a space chair (naturally for such a craft) a proper steering handle, lights, two heavy duty harpoon guns, healthy printed details,&nbsp; a rudder, chunky turbines and what? A rotatable, triple harpoon gun weapons platform? Woah,&nbsp;easy The Lego Group, that&#39;s almost &#39;destroyer class&#39; for a small sub. Two excellent mechanised arms enable the front to raid and clip objects in to a&nbsp;&#39;hand&#39; or magnetise a safe box with loot in it and you get two of them.</p>

<p>This set is not large, just medium but has so much going on in it, it surely provides&nbsp;plenty of fun and with its excellent bits remains a one-off theme with some specifics that justify keeping it as a set. The price is a mild minus point for size apart from the play value and the fact it is a strong, stand alone theme. Hard to fault, this is a keeper for your seabed.</p>
