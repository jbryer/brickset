"Falconhood","2006-11-22T15:38:05Z","good for $7.99","i thot i was going to like Claw Crusher much more, but i like the spinnning shield after-all. And the gun comes out of the hand. Using a part from the pilot of Claw Crusher, my Cyclone Defender has 4 fingers. i am not sure i like the ball joint. this line is becoming MORE Bionicle (to me, that is NOT a good thing).

"legozander","2007-04-02T13:05:46.223Z","Good set. :)","I really like this set. However it does have its problems.However most can be fixed. The bad: The cockpit falls out easily(I fixed that though)and the cockpit is rather cheesy(Most people dont think so but I do. :P), Also the sheild can fall off a bit easily as well as the gun. The good: Very good colour shceme. Good posability with Bionicle joints. Also I really like the new Ryo minifig. The sheild is fun to spin around with the cog mechanism and the two black swords look great as well. Overall this is a great set and if you dont mind the few problems I would highly recomend this set. Good job Lego!

"phoinix","2007-05-02T08:05:26.403Z","mixed feelings","i have mixed feelings about this set.
there are a lot of bionicle parts and this is terrible!
the first line of exo was a lot better for sure..
i like the shield but i hate the gun in the hand..and it falls of really easily
i dont like the huge bionicle feet but they do make the set a lot more stedy ans solid
the minifig looks great ant that is the best part of the set

again i miss the first exo force line with more system parts...
3 out of five for this one..(i would rather give it a 2.5)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2007-06-05T07:51:10.123Z","Beware robots!","Cool set, has MUCH more poseability(espescially in the legs). The shield doesn't go up as high as I want it to, and it sometimes hits the side of the cockpit, but thats a minor detail. The gun is nice, and if youmove it back a bit and attach one of those blaster barrels, it becomes a rifle.

Nice set, reccomended for Exo-force fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2008-01-01T16:55:21.25Z","Katanas ","I bought this for the Japanese swords featured in the set but after some moding this is a good set.
First it comes in a small box there isn't that many pieces so the build goes quick. Ryo is a lot different than the one from the first line he has a dark green torso with some gold details on it, and dark green legs his hair is made of a non flexible rubber. As with all Exo-force characters he has a face printed on each side of his head a normal face and an angry face. His only accessory is a wrench which is clipped onto the mech
The mech is a little bigger than I expected it uses Bionicle joints which allow for a wide range of poses but they do slip sometimes causing the mech to fall over. There is a dial under the shield that allows for you to spin the shield without your hands interfering with it. There are no controls in the cockpit which in my opinion is bad even a sticker would have been better. However there is a code brick If you go on Lego.com/Exo-force you can register it and unlock some backgrounds and stickers for your Clubpage. 
The mech comes with a little pistol which can be put into or taken out of its hand fairly easily some robot arms are used for fingers to hold it in place. However the pistol looks bad and somewhat pathetic so I replaced mine with a small assault rifle which looks better I also made a better shield and moded some other small areas.
Overall it’s not that great unless you really like Exo-force or are a heavy modder. There are a lot of stickers also which can be a hassle to apply. Because of stickers Bionicle joints which slip and overall places that could have been done better I can't give this a very high mark. 3/5

"Blade","2007-10-18T08:38:52.42Z","Not What I Expected!","Firstly I'm going to honest I bought this set because I wanted Claw Crusher to have something else to break and looking at it on the shelf I kind of wanted it, kind of thought it looked lame. After getting it built I have changed my mind and decided you really need to see and play with this one before you judge it.

The mech itself is quite sturdy and I have found it quite poseable. It has armor everywhere including on the back of it's legs as a mech should. It dose have the ball joints on it that have been used in Slizers, Bionical etc. but they make it much more fun in play than being limited to only eight clicks on a joint.

The hand is quite good but doesn't meet up with with 8001's claw. The gun is real lame. It seems to just be thrown in with no real design in it and looks horrible, fix it, loose it, some where to put it would be nice. 

The shield is a true bit of LEGO genius. Something so simple from Technic brought over to LEGO and makes it rule. For those who don't know the shield spins around using some clever gears behind the shield. This makes the shield a weapon in itself due to the swords.

The mini-fig is Ryo and he is in all green like his mech with some gold too, purple spiky hair and a head band make him look quite different. Also he has a different face on the back of his head so you can change his mood. The extra face is covered by his hair.

Now the flaws. As I mentioned above a holster for the gun would be good. Also the cockpit is flimsy and should be attached in a much better way but it is easily fixed. My biggest gripe ever. STICKERS. This thing has heaps of them and the worst bit is the Exo-Code is printed on. Something that will never ever be used again in LEGO.

Overall I like the model and it has lot of potential, with  few light upgrades it is perfect but in current state taking into factor Aesthetics, color scheme, playability and cons, I give this model a 7/10 and I feel it is worth f anyone who is a robot/ mech warrior fan. Also makes a great display model.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

But saying that to the person would have been mean.Enough about that, let's see the pros and cons shall we?

Pros:

"Shadow_Crawler","2008-03-03T01:54:48.64Z","Robots Beware!","This set is amll, but packs a lot of punch! I don't wanna say anything about the guns, it's too simple and doesn't have playability. The shield is VERY COOL, with two blades attached to it. I also like the green colour, but sometimes the feet easily come loose. Great Set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

turning sheild
hand grab
ryo minifiger
cons:
can rip arms and legs off
allways falls

"legoguysw","2008-09-07T09:55:40.67Z","Goodbye, farewell, Exo Force!","It seems that some of the better Exo force are the small ones, like Uplink and this. The spinning shield with blades is great, it works by twisting a knob behind, as is easy to do. The gun is a little bit juniorized, but it is well made. The cockpit is nothing special, and behind is a wrench for Ryo. The legs are good, and haven't suffered the fate of bionicle-ization like some other Exo Force sets have sadly.
Overall a great display set, as well a good strong build and super spinning shield mechanism, did i mention it has Ninja swords on it? Superb pieces for your collection! a **** out of *****, 4 out of 5 stars that means, as it is nothing special but still good. A must get for Exo fans!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-10T14:45:14.28Z","Defender of the golden city","Another with ryo's minifigure, this in a green machine, with a shield and little katana pieces included on it. The cyclone defender looks like something with the claw crusher, the legs, arms, and the hands in the right arm, but this hangs a weapon, and have a shield in the place of a weapon. The feet were from bionicle. The cockpit is different comparing with another small sets of exo force of 05 and 06.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

","This set is so so, like the title says. The rotating shield is cool, and this set is a great way to collect ninja swords. Like I said, the shield is cool, but I am very disappointed with the gun. I feel that I could have made a much better one, and I'm not that great of a builder. if you want to get nice minifigs and ninja swords, then this is the set to buy, bu otherwise, don't buy it.

"asianlego","2008-10-12T02:26:25.873Z","Warning: Extremely Fast Spinning Katanas","This set is quite good and most people received it with mixed feelings. The mecha in unbelievably sturdy for me. The main attraction of the set is obviously the shield which has two katanas that spin if you twist the fiddle at behind it. The gun is horribly designed. The cockpit is good and the glass windshield fits around Ryo perfectly leaving no gaps except at the sides. There is also a wrench placed beside the cockpit and I found out that the end of the wrench works as a brick separator! Nice! The shoulders here are plain bricks and did not use those large empty molded Technic/Bionicle shoulders as some other mechas use, example the two mechas in Gate Assault.
