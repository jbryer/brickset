"legozander","2007-06-10T08:39:55.92Z","A package of fun.","OK. So I got this set recently. And I am going to share my opinion of it to you all. When you open the box you see an assorment of black and grey and orange and silver lego peices. (Wow!) Nothing all that new here. There are some pretty nifty peices here though. There is a silver missile peice which I like a lot. And two orange bionicle joints. A bonus in my opinion. Also there is that orange peice on the cockpit that goes around the Devastator. Is it new or what? The build of the set is nothing that new because I have already build the Cyclone Defender which has a similar design. When building the body I accidently put the studded peices which connect to the ball joint peices on both sides instead on just one. Which resulted in when I got to the part when I needed the peice I had put in the body on the arm I nearly had a heart attack. The legs are pretty similar to the Cyclone Defenders but they are attached on diffrently. The claw arm is really cool. It is really fun to play with it. The gun arm is good as well and the multi barreled laser cannon is good. When the set is built is has several fun things to mess about with. First of all the ball joints add great posability to the set. The claw arm is great fun to play with and to nick the gun out of Cyclone Defenders hand.;) The legs are good to make poses with. You cant do anything with the multi barreled gun exept aim it, but its coolness makes up for that. The body is cool and the cockpit is nice. The only problem is that the cockpit likes to fall out. The exo-code is nothing new cos I already searched the internet for pictures of it and found the code. Also I love the colour sheme. Black and orange is so cool! So overall the set is great the only problem being that the cockpit likes to fall out. So now my exo-force collection has gone up to 5 sets!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-07-01T09:06:13.64Z","Claw Dose It All!","I bought this set just today and i did because while looking in the store it was the model that caught my eye the most and then the price did as well. $10 you can go wrong for a model this size. i know sets that had a quarter of the pieces for that price.

As said before the model has a great colour scheme and dose look impressive because if it. Also the skeletal structure and weapons are impressive, giving it a true mech look. 

One down side to this is the legs. No knee movement and although stands sturdy looks very week and frail in the top half or thigh, which from a battle point, would be my first area to strike.

The only other annoyance is if you play with it, the armour on the arm falls off when bending the arm up, restricting the arms capabilities.

Summary: Awesome model for looks and reasonably practical. 8/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"moloko","2007-09-11T14:47:35.06Z","Fun to build","I like this set.  One of my favorites for Exo-force.  The claws are a bit lame and could be better built.  Takes only a few minutes to build with only 99 parts.  I like the colors and parts list. 

Pros:  color scheme
       alien looks cool
       mech design is top notch

Cons:  More weapons would be cool.

"Stash","2009-02-15T15:59:42.623Z","A great model, but the real value is in the pieces!","I picked up this set while they were on sale for under 5 dollars, and while I wanted at least one for the model, I picked up 4 to get all the extra bits. You get some really great and rare pieces in this set and for the price, that is hard to beat.

Build:

The build was very easy and straightforward. Nothing was very difficult here. Occasionally Lego has you putting parts together that would be much easier to do in a different order, but I don't recall that with this set. 

Mini-fig:

You get a little Devestator mini-fig, which is nice to have. It isn't anything too special, but you can make a small little army of robots with it. 

Model:

This thing has some great posability and is fairly sturdy. Another poster commented that the claws do not extend wide, but they do. 

Parts:

This is where the real value comes in. The ball-hinge joints are superb. You can do so many things with these, I really wish I had bought more of these sets just for those. The orange parts are not too common, like the orange grill pieces and claws. The black pieces are good for roof tiles. I also like having more of those robot arm pieces with the hole to insert something. Great for MOCs. You really can't miss with much here, it all goes nicely into the bits category and for 5 dollars (even 10) you are getting a good deal.


Negatives:

Stickers, but they aren't strictly necessary. I didn't put mine on and it still looked good. 


Overall:

This is a decent model, but also a great parts selection. For the price, which falls within the 10 cents per piece ratio I use as a standard even at the full retail price, it is a great deal. I would recommend getting one if you get a chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-10T14:26:04.217Z","Claw crusher","This is a little exo-force from 2007, claw crusher. The set is from exo-force but some pieces are compatible with bionicle, racers, creator... Like the feet of the toa metru, and some pieces in the weapon on his left hand. Includes a robot minifigure, that some parts like the claws were used later in bionicle. The right arm of the machine have a claw with three fingers, with awesome orange. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-15T03:01:32.7Z","Coolest weapon in the Exo-Force series.","The automatic rollgun on its left hand is very cool and I am very pleased with it and its very easy to hook it up to non-Technic sets as well eventhough the bulk of the rollgun consists of Technic parts.

The claws is not very nice, it doesn't open up very wide as the picture indicates. And it looks very out of place with the oversized claws.

I didn't like the feet either as they look like Christmas sled's lower portion.

The minifig is very cool as it is silver in colour and stands out in the usual line up of bronze Robot faction minifigs and even has a red eye for that 'evil look'.

Overall this set is not bad and you should get it if on sale. I got mine for $5 and I should have gotten more.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"tonga256","2009-09-28T03:56:50.53Z","I've got two!","That's right, I have two of them. I got them for my 9th birthday.

Pros:
- rotating machine guns,
- big claw,
- missle,
- EXO-code.

Cons:
- EXO-code doesn't work anymore,
- missle doesn't shoot, you have to pick it up and throw it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The giant claw is the best thing about this set it also may be it's greatest flaw but more on that in the PROS and CONS

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T23:09:30.257Z","Super Sentai Force GO!","<p>Set #8101 Claw Crusher: Exo-Force was a theme I really wanted to get more of, but I kept ignoring it in favor of Star Wars and other sets until finally they all up and vanished from the shelf, but I managed to pick this one up at discount from the store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contemplated getting rid of it during my Make Space for new LEGO purge, but then I realized that this is a really great set! It is an ingenious mech and the Mini-Figure is a unique character that I can't find fault with, he might even fit into a Star Wars display as a unique alien droid creature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Exo-Force Theme is LEGO's answer to the anime craze and it does the job quite well. Even this set - which doesn't include any of the zanier Mini-Figure designs or hairpieces - is worth having in anyone's collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the pieces are also quite new to me, or were at the time of initial purchase and the uniform color scheme helps make this mech and its pilot stand out. I am hopeful that some day I will be able to acquire more figures to join him, but for now he will stand alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I definitely think that this is one piece you can't do without, even if you don't particularly like/enjoy the Exo-Force Theme, its design could fit in anywhere, even LEGO City.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
