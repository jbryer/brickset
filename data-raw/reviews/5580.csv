"CyandraZ","2007-02-03T16:27:02.863Z","Great, but Grand Titan is better.","Year 2 of exo-force got off to a great start, introducting some sick mechs and interesting new concepts! Blade Titan is a great example. Besides having tons of useful pieces (dark red and white slopes, and brand new bionicle/system brick joints!), the model is pretty nice! It's not as armored or as titan like as Grand Titan, but the cockpit and legs are great, and the color scheme works beautifully! Takeshi V2 has an aweome torso, as do all the new human pilots! Although, the faces are still the same (thus carrying over their ugly back printing). The weapons are not as good as the ones in Grand Titan; the shield is a bit strange, and the weapon to arm connection looks weak. Still, I love the gatling cannon and rocket rack, and overall the kit has a lot going for it. I recomend it! 4/5 - Great!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Paul007","2007-04-09T14:11:44.927Z","Best battle machine yet","This new walker is much better than Hikarus new set.  This has four missiles on top, a rotating sheild, and six heavy cannons.  This is the best $15 exo-force set, because the flying ones are ugly at the addition of engines.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2007-04-27T13:27:44.92Z","bang... bye bye","
Very nice set, big gun (slightly longer than it looks in the pics),rotating and extending shield, rotating missile launcher and disc gun (tractor beam?). Some very nice shoulder armour panels, and big grippy feet.

My only problem is that the shield doesn't always fold up like it's supposed to. But that could probably be fixed with some technic pieces and a small elastic.

Overal, nice set, highly recommended for mech and Exo-Force fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2007-10-27T22:42:19.17Z","Shield","I think the rotating shield id excellent, but it's colour are bad. I don't like the combination between red and gray-white. The guns are very cool, but it doesn't do much. I also like the shoulder armor they are cool with the radar and 4 rockets. It is very poseable too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"witzenHammer","2008-01-08T14:02:09.56Z","WOW, I'm a LEGO ADDICT all of a sudden","I'd been building legos with my son out of a random mix up multi generational set for a few months and enjoying it, 
but when we got this one assembled, I suddenly could not stop thinking about LEGOs.

this thing is amazing!
the rotation joint bricks are unbelievable. at first I wondered why they didn't use ball joints, but these can hold the pose of the bulkier parts much better.  
I didn't know LEGO had bridged the gap between System and Technic so well,
Now I can do some of the stuff I wanted to do back in the day when I stopped playing with Legos cause they didn't have good joints for limbs.

super cool!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-13T13:50:29.56Z","One of the best Exo Force","The blade titan is a set of 2007, in the exo force series. This set includes the Takeshi minifigure, different of the 2006 minifigure, included on the blade titan set. The minifigure is good designed, but the lego minifigure classic style is much better than this try of make a lego minifigure in anime design. The machine have a nice color scheme and building system, that do the pilot be on a good place, in the torso, to the machine have also a good playability. The blades, combined with the shield, on the right arm, are small, and the rotating system of this weapon is not very good, like the weapon on the left arm, that have none action. The arms are really small, but more playable than the exoforce of 2006. The legs are tall in relation with the body of the robot and stay very well. The feet are great and it be fixed on the legs, that don't unbuilt when you are playing with the set. The set is playable but it is not awesome, due to the design, costs and also the fun, but is one of the best exo force sets. I rate the Blade titan 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"P13c30fch33s3","2008-12-19T22:54:53.827Z","The most powerful human battle machine of all...","...unless you create combo models.

pros:
tall
nice leg armour
gun is cool
shield
main armour

cons:
shield can't quite reach the centre of the body
shoulder plates tend to flop around


excellent if you want some firepower
just a note:
the sky titan's armour looks useless unless modified",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The blade spinning function adds some nice playability.<br></li><li>-The color scheme is very classic-looking, classic, and it definitely fit's Takeshi.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The amount of stickers on this is evil, the Voldemort of Lego sets, here to destroy the value of this set.<br></li><li>-The yellow looks interesting, but would have been nice to see more of it to follow a more colorful model.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a truly amazing mech, and is nice for newer fans. This set would have been a great buy at 20 dollars even when it was actually being sold in stores. I recommend it very highly.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Rokinath","2014-11-09T12:59:07.797Z","A classy fighter for as long as the stickers last.","<p>Even at first glance you can tell this is a successor to the Grand Titan and it even packs some subtle improvements. It was great fun to play with but these days I can barely look at it what with every single sticker peeling off it (this is going to be my main gripe for this review). Still...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A stylish new colour palette, an improvement over the block red of Takeshi&#39;s previous mech.</li>
	<li>The longer (wider?) feet offer a bit more stability too.</li>
	<li>The blade shield is a very cool weapon and well designed too. (A neat trick: if you rotate the blades in one direction then quickly spin it back for a moment, the blades retract into their original position!)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stickerstickerstickersstickers. Why can&#39;t we just have printed blocks?</li>
	<li>The arms that carry the armament (pun intended) are far too stubby. The shield cannot be moved to protect the cockpit and moving it into a position where the blades won&#39;t collide with the rest of the mech is tedious.</li>
	<li>The shoulder plates are quite loose and can be swung back and forth easily. It seems silly.</li>
	<li>The minigun&nbsp;isn&#39;t as good as the last one. It doesn&#39;t spin nearly as well and... I kind of miss the light block :c</li>
</ul>

<p>I really want to give this set a higher rating, I do, but there&#39;s so many niggles that are hard to ignore that just cheapen the whole set.</p>
