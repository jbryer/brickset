Once you pose it how you like it looks awesome! Great sword and hand-held energy-ball launcher. Great new-style cockpit design too. My favourite of the new 07 sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2007-02-14T16:01:17.513Z","Exo-cellent!","This set has alot of good stuff in it. More poseable arms, a full left hand, energy sphere launcher (which is actually a zamor sphere launcher from bionicle), a brand new sword, and some nice wings. my only complaint is that it has some hole in the body, but those are easily fixed.

Overall, nice set

P.S. the big feet are required for stabilization, so thats why the 2007 big mechs (except the shadow crawler) have them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2008-05-04T16:50:09.873Z","Decent.","Released in 2007, Sky Guardian unfortunately exhibited some of the same problems common to the majority of the Exo-Force kits that year. However, the overall design thankfully had positives as well, and was far better looking than other human mechs like the Areo Booster and Blade Titan.

Like all the mechs that year, Sky Guardian did away with the lightbricks and went for a simpler body design, using new bionicle/system fusion joints in the upper limbs. The legs is simple, and yet they look sleek and armored. The cockpit design is much more interesting: using several click hinges, two large jets attach to the sides, with a thin canopy in between. This design may not be airtight, but it still looks cool. 

Unfortunately, the neat design in the basic mech shape is sacrificed in the weapons design. Instead of intricate weapons, Sky Guardian makes due with a Bionicle zamor launcher and a giant pre-molded sword, both which look tacked on. Granted, the sword is a cool piece, but doesn’t look quite right. The Zamor launcher is even worse – it makes the whole arm look like it’s from a bionicle creation, not a system creation. Now, I love bionicle myself, and am all for system/bionicle fusion in sets, but this takes it too far and makes the mech look thrown together. The only good thing about the weapons is a small rocket launcher pod above the cockpit, which looks cool without being distracting or tacked on.

Piecewise, Sky Guardian is decent. The best parts are 4 dark blue tiles, some dark blue slopes, and four giant dark blue fins. The jet engines are also cool, as we haven’t seen that piece much lately. The rest is standard exo-force fare – click joints, slopes, and the lot. As always, one figure is included – this time Hikaru. However, he is in a new uniform, and the uniform itself is amazing – it looks like something out of anime and manga.

Overall, Sky Guardian may have its faults, especially with the weapons, but a little work could turn it into something amazing. If you don’t mind the tacked-on weapons, Sky Guardian is a decent pick. 3/5

"Shadow_Crawler","2007-10-27T22:46:35.013Z","Sky Guardian","Overall it is good, but not as good as Blade Titan. I like its 4 wings, big sword, and sphere launcher. But is not too poseable and sometimes the sphere loose easily. But LEGO has equip it with a second sphere in case if the first one are lost. I rate it 3,5/5 and 78% out of 100%",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

 (8103) is a LEGO Exo-Force set which came out in 2007. It comes
with 1 minifig and 144 pieces. This set does include a few decals and 
there're no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces.</p><p><br></p><p><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8103-1.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p><p><br>
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><br>The box and the instructions are very nice.
 As I told you at the beginning: There're no mistakes in the 
instructions. Recommended age is 7-14. The box is very shiny and on the back is are all of the early 2007 LEGO Exo-Force sets. There's also a little comic on the back.<br><br><p><span><br></span></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><br><span>The parts are very nice. The hockey stick is very unique to this set. It's a huge yellow piece with a sticker in the middle of this element. We also get a ball launcher which we've seen in the LEGO BIONICLE Piraka figures a lot.<br><br></span><span></span><br><span><span><span></span></span></span><p><span><span><span></span><br></span></span></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><br><br><p><span><span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hiraku:</span></span> Hiraku comes with a blue hair piece which looks really awsome on him. He has a dark blue torso with some very cool golden markings and he also got dark blue pants and black hands. On his face Hiraku has a serious look and orange shades. His face is double-printed. On the back of his face you can see a wild look on him.<br>
</span></span></p>
<p><br>
  <span><span></span></span></p><b>The build</b><br><br><span>The build is very awsome and interesting. I think this set won't take you longer than 20-25 minutes to build. It's an exciting set to build and it has some very cool elements. As I told you: The hockey stick is unique to this set.<br><br></span><span></span><br><h4>The completed model<br></h4><br>
<p><br></p><p>The completed model of the sky gurdian is very attractive and very awsome. I like the way how LEGO designed the legs with the engines and the tube. The legs, the feet and the arms are all movable. The windscreen of the cockpit and the turbines sviwel and one of the turbines has the Exo-Force code on the top. On the top of the mech you can see a turret which siviwels and the huge dark blue fins are movable as well. One arm of the mech is holding a ball launcher. The launcher shoots the balls very good. The other arm has 4 'fingers' and they're holding the hockey stick.<br></p><p><span><br></span></p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8103-1.jpg[/img]</span><br><p><br></p>
<h4>Positive:</h4><br>Minifig<br>Unique pieces<br>Attractive box<br>Attractive design<br>Legs of the mech have an engine<br>Ball launcher shoots very well<br>Nice pieces for brickfilms and MOC's<br><br><h4>Negative:</h4><br>Stickers<br><br><h4>Summary</h4><p><br>All
in all this set is okay and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"tkettle9719","2012-01-07T09:49:47.613Z","Classic Exo-Force!","<p>I got this set from Target a couple of days after Christmas, and was pleased overall from this set as my favorite basic human mech from the 2007 line of the theme.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-There is an excellent impression of a flying mech with this set.<br></li><li>-The weapons here are excellent, whether it be the electric sword, or the sphere gun.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The legs seem to be a small amount thin.<br></li><li>-Our old friend stickers seem to be back to mock and laugh at us.<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is excellent, and looks very much like something that could come out of Robotech, one of my favorite shows ever. I recommend this to all who love mechs.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
