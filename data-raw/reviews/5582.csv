"legozander","2007-04-03T06:35:11.043Z","Exellent. :)","I really like this set. But it does have a few annoying problems. The problems: It is hard to get the robot into the cockpit. Also the back leg will give way every now and again. Not to mention the easy to lose disks... The good: Awesome colour scheme, Very cool robot pilot, nice weapons too. Also there is a lime green Pohatu Nuva weapon! I like the prison pod as well(But why on earth is there a skeleton inside?). The body design stays together quite well but can break to peices if you are not careful while messing/playing with it. It looks impressive when built and looks a lot taller that I expected! Overall a very good set with intresting peices and a good build. Highly recommended!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2008-05-08T16:08:36.327Z","Very fun set.","Shadow Crawler is easily one of the most unusual Exo-Force kits ever, even considering that it was released in 2007 – a year filled with unique Exo-force experiments.

The design took a basic four legged spider mech and went crazy with the features, taking off one leg, adding a prison pod on the back, and other unusual details. In general, exo-force is unrealistic, but Shadow Crawler took it to a whole new level. The whole concept of a three legged mech just wouldn’t work in real life, and the prison pod would weigh the back down, further hampering movement.

That said, Shadow Crawler is really quite fun because of its absurdity – much like General Grievous’ wheel bike in Star Wars Episode 3. The designers obviously had a lot of fun designing it, and it shows imagination, something that was lacking in many of the 2007 exo-force kits. The kit also has a very solid design and a menacing color scheme – and is just plain cool to look at.

Piecewise, Shadow Crawler doesn’t really have that much of interest. Some black slopes, bionicle/system fusion joints, a few lime pieces, and the trans neon-green canopies are the highlights, but there is nothing really that special or rare in Shadow Crawler.

Overall, though, Shadow Crawler is extremely enjoyable as a kit, and livens up the mostly mediocre 2007 lineup. It was a welcome break from two legged mechs when it came out, and still is a fun kit today. If you’re looking for a zany exo-force kit, Shadow Crawler is a great choice. 4/5.

"Gus_263","2008-03-13T14:09:27.623Z","Shadow Crawler","This exo force set have some notable differences of the building system. The form is basically a spider with only three paws and a weapon. The set is good in builting and also on the design, that features green and black colors. This set also includes a robot minifigure, the same of some used in 2006 and a skeleton minifigure, that be inside the green sphere. The playability is not the best, and it makes that the set be boring sometimes when you play with it. The weapon is another error, because it is a large weapon with none action, only the mini discs that can be launched, but it is bad positioned. This set have useful pieces, but they are not in a good position to play with. Overall, the Shadow Crawler is a nice set but the playability is unfortunately bad. So, i rate 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"vexorian","2010-07-01T22:09:42.39Z","Large, limited mobility, 2 cockpit pieces","<p>So, this was my first exo-force set. Yes, I gave it a 3/5 but that's just the overall grade, I do not really regret getting it, but unfortunately, it has issues that prevent me to give it a higher grade.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building Experience 5/5. Well, I had a lot of fun building it. No idea why:) . Well, it is interesting and it has a couple of aspects there. It also manages to surprise you when you get to the final steps. Because it turns into a LARGE thing. Yep, when you begin building up the torso, you have no idea how large it will get once you finish the legs (which are in the last pages).</p>
<p>Parts: 4/5. Mostly the prison feature makes me give it this high grade, you get 2 spherical cockpit pieces, that's very nice, but you also get the skeleton minifig. Although it has the evil face instead of the classic one it is still a cute skeleton fig... There's also the trans pieces and all the stuff in the canons. The legs themselves are huge parts, but of the useful kind. I think they can work as wings as well as legs. We also have the bionicle 2 system parts (you know, those system parts that use bionicle ball joints, very useful for things.) Not to mention the little green horns. 4/5 because I guess this is not really impressive in comparison with other exo-force sets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it comes with stickers. Tons of them. I am also somewhat dissappointed of the robot minifig. Its head and torso are a single piece, all the silver is blended with the trans green.</p>
<p>Playability: 3/5. Well I am sorry, but this set is mostly for show. As said, it is unexpectedly huge. But it is also unexpectedly bad at mobility. The legs can only rotate in the z axis and you are not going to move it realistically or pose it with them. I don't get why couldn't they just replace the technic joints that attach the legs to the mech with a couple of pieces for ball articulation.&nbsp; That would have greatly improved the set.</p>
<p>Then we have the disk shooter. It is horrid. Now it can really shoot the disks when used correctly, and it is cool to be able to shoot 10 of them in sucession. But when you are moving the mech to make it do something else than shooting, the disks will fall off which is very anti-climatic. I am also not very sure for how long is it going to be possible to use the disk launcher before it breaks, it is just a plastic piece which you must push and hope for it to use its elasticity to shoot the disks.</p>
<p>I have decided to remove the disk launchers. Seeing how other exo-force sets have technic bolt shooters or flick fire missiles, this is a low point in exo-force playability.</p>
<p>There is also nothing the drone fig can do. He doesn't have a gun for him and the mech doesn't really have controls. It is hard to get what this robot fig is doing in the set playability-wise.</p>
<p>The guns can be posed and moved freely though.</p>
<p>Value for money 4/5 Lol, Bolivian LEGO retailers are terrible and do not believe in sales. They may put a set in shelf for ages without any disccount hoping that some poor soul would buy it anyway. Plus they over-charge. I had to pay 20 dollars for this in 2010! and that was after asking for different prices in various stores. That said, I think that for 15 dollars it is ok value-wise. As said, it is much bigger than it seems. Also, if you live in a place with sane-minded retailers, you should be able to get it for even 10 USD. If you get that price and love sci-fi ish stuff, you should enjoy this set at least for the pieces.</p>",TRUE,3,4,5,3,4

The box art alone oozes menace and the completed model is just as good, but it isn&#39;t without flaws...</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The looks. Whats not to like?</li>
	<li>The weaponry. The gun arms have a good range of movement and the disc launcher is nice if you actually want to fire projectiles</li>
	<li>The minifig, mind you I always liked these robots.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Critically, the mech lacks stability; particularly the back leg on mine has a tendency to slip and cause the walker to fall.</li>
	<li>As a result of the above, its rather fiddly to move the mech.</li>
	<li>The disc launcher. Personally I don&#39;t like these as I worry enough about the back leg falling without having to worry about all those tiny little discs falling out.</li>
	<li>Stickers. The ones on mine are holding so far but I&#39;m dreading the day they start to peel off.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall&nbsp;its a great set and you should definitely grab it if you can find it on the cheap. It just has a few flaws that prevent it from &nbsp;being excellent.</p>

"fair_use","2018-06-15T14:22:37.423Z","Different formula for the year's wave that stands out ","<p>The Shadow Crawler offers a different kind of experience for the standard price tag back when it was released. Subjectively, I quite enjoy mechs as a concept and mech builds from Lego, and this set is no different. I was pleased with the differences in the formula for Exo-Force&#39;s standard mechs, it offered a different experience even for a theme that stands out to me for it&#39;s standard average sized set&nbsp;individuality. However there are of course some detractions from the sets for it&#39;s style. Compared to the other Exo-Force mechs, the Shadow Crawler is significantly less articulate. It also has a little less detail in the build that some might be looking for due to the fact that three similar legs must be built repeatedly instead of the&nbsp;standard two legs and two arms. As for the things that make this set great to me, it has a great function that adds to its tank-like stance that I always felt with it. When disks are loaded into the barrel on the top of the set in front of the skeleton pod, they can be launched by a small lever that offers a &quot;flick&quot; function. This was largely exclusive to Exo-Force and its one of the most notable smaller sets that made use of this function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- Function</p>

<p>- Size for money&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Individuality (subjective pro)</p>

<p>- Less articulate&nbsp;</p>
