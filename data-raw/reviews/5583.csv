The imposing height, menacing claws, numerous blasters and firing missle have made me a fan. The big poseable feet help keep the center of gravity low and it will even stand on my couch.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-13T14:20:53.543Z","Iron Condor","The iron condor is a simple exo force set of 2007, that have the same system of some other exo force sets of 2007. The figure included is a robot, the same of some sets. The machine is fun to play with sometimes, but the wings are not much good builted and the position is also bad. One thing that makes the robot looks like just a simple set, is the torso, that the minifigure stay, but also in a bad position. The legs and arms do not have much differences in size, and these are good builted, with useful pieces and playability. The color scheme is cool, yellow and black. The wapon on the right arm works very well, and like a cannon, but the left weapon is not great, is just a claw with three fingers, smaller than the claws of the small set Claw Crusher. Overall, the set have a good playability, except in the wings, have also a good design, colors and a weapon on the right hand, but the claw on the left hand is not good. The robot torso is very simple, and the minifigure don't be fixed well in it. So, i rate 4/5 ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CyandraZ","2008-05-08T15:27:51.793Z","Not the best of kits.","Possibly one of the weakest kits of 2007, the Iron Condor is also an excellent example of the lackluster design much of the second year of Exo-Force exhibited.

The basic design is far less armored than the previous large flying robot mech, the Fire Vulture. The cockpit is so weakly designed that one good shot would knock the pilot right out. Even flying upside down would be a problem for the robot pilot, as the cockpit has no top and no real front.

The weapons are another problem – the Iron Condor is very under armed. Its main weapons are either a one shot deal (like the slapped on missile) or only good in close combat (the talons). The other weapons - a tiny laser cannon and a single rocket - are too small to do much damage at all, leaving the Iron Condor without a real effective way of downing mechs. This is very disappointing, because TLC has done far better with fleshing out the close combat mech type, like in the Blazing Falcon and the 2008 robot mechs. The Iron Condor… not so much.

What is even more disappointing is that other elements of the Iron Condor show great design. The legs are simple but cool, the feet are very well designed, and the wings are amazing. The Iron Condor is also the first and only exo-force humanoid mech to have waist movement. If only this ingenuity had carried into the cockpit and weapons design.

Even in pieces the Iron Condor doesn’t do so well. Aside from a few black slopes and the bionicle/system fusion joints common to all the 2007 mechs, there is really nothing special in the Iron Condor.

Iron Condor is really a sad case of what TLC failed to do in much of 2007 – combine good design with good piece selections. Still, if you are an Exo-Force enthusiast, there is no reason not to pick up Iron Condor. All other lego fans, however, would be wise to stay away. 2.5/5",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"knuclear200x","2009-03-24T03:40:18.42Z","Death FROM ABOVE!","I'm going to start the review, saying this. The Exo-Force villains' mechs are Way Better than the heroes' mech. Just look at it. That menacing design, the nice color combination, is that a claw arm? Wow.

Pros:
It isn't really made of iron, but it's still a condor and it seemed to have replaced one of its talons with a missile launcher. It has a nice poseable set of wings too. The claw arm? Awesome. It's actually fangs inserted into an iron drone arm's claw sockets. The mech also has a lot of non-firing guns, along with the far-firing missile launcher on its right arm. The legs and feet are another cool thing, notice the rocket boosters under the knees. The feet are another awesome feature, u can bend them up or down, and they can even be rotated. So if you wanted to pose it in anyway, the feet will suit just about any position that'll make you happy. And probably the best feature that surprised me the most, was the waist. I'm not sure how, the waist is tight and you can turn it 360 degrees without worrying about it getting loose. Honestly I'm not sure if it'll last long but I have never turned it that much.

Cons:
The Elbow section makes arm-poseability a little limited and the arms are sometimes something I dread for being short. So if you tried to put the arms down, it'll look like you spilled water on it and it's about to say ""ugh"". The other cons are the upward-triangle blocks that are placed on the sides of the Iron Drone pilot. They tend to fall off easily since they aren't specially fastened by some cool building technique. And for some reason, only the one on the right is a shoulder-cannon while the other is just that place for a license plate. It can be fixed but you know...
And the claw arm could've used another finger, and some longer fangs. But it still looks great.

Overall: 
Despite it's shortcomings, this is set screams ""awesome"" with its appealing design and great poseability. Something you definitely don't want to miss.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legoguy2805","2009-04-17T14:43:03.03Z","The armour-ripping, machine-blasting Iron Condor","I got this for 99p at a charity shop with all the pieces there. The Knight's Kingdom joints are usually rubbish, but they are good on the Iron Condor because the foot connects with a pin, giving the legs excellent posability. The arms have Bionicle-type ball socket joints, making them extremely posable too. The wings are posable but flimsy. The yellow blaster at the front looks strange. The Devastator pilot is easy to put in and out of the cockpit.

Pros:
Very posable
Missile Launcher
Homing missile
4 blasters
Devastator pilot

	I got this set from my grandparents for Easter one year a long time ago, and really loved this set. It has many weapons, claws, and some really tight wings.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The are effectively made out of many pieces, and have a nice black-yellow-red color scheme of evil.</li>
	<li>
		The mech is turnable, making it very posable.</li>

<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The claw is there for a reason, but if there were a bladed weapon, it would be a bit cooler.</li>
	<li>
		The loss of a cockpit covering is also unusual, but not in a good way.</li>

	This mech is awesome, and is a great addition to the robot&#39;s army. It pairs perfectly with the Sky Guardian of Hikaru, and should be bought together.</p>
