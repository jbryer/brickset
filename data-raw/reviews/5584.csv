The vehicles are interesting, because they do conform to the trade federation/ CIS look. The STAP is a great improvement on the previous design in the naboo swamp set, as it looks smooth and swooshable. The battle droid carrier, though not being movie accurate, is a good way to store battle droids without having to risk breaking their hands, and you can get them all off of there quite quickly.

To be blunt this droid carrier isn’t great. Let’s be fair it lacks good design and Lego initiative!!!!

This model is far worse than the past version and is a classic re-make gone horrifically wrong. This one looks like a slug and is so impractical it’s unreal. But I would be a good buy, just for the droids and lets be fair you can always modify the carrier.

"_add_um","2007-09-22T07:33:47.343Z","Droids droids and more droids!!","<p>*<b>Review was revised on the 16th of December 2013</b>*<br><br>Awsome set. This one of the first two Battle Packs released back in 2007. It notably had Super Battle Droids which hadn't been in sets for a while (of course now they're in plently of sets).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The design of the box and instructions are nice. It's my favourite box art used for any of Star Wars set even now in 2013. The box art includes the 30th anniversary of Star Wars logo too. One thing that bugged me is on the back of the box it shows four blasters for the Battle Droid but only two are included.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Not many unique parts are included but a nice selection of parts. Lots of brown parts which are handy.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A total of seven minifigures are in included: four Battle Droids (with the horizontal hands) and three Super Battle Droids. Only two Battle Droids are armed. The droids themselves are fairly common but are still great to collect even now. It should be noted this is the <b>last ever </b>set to have the ""megaphone blasters"". In 2007 the new blaster molds were introduced and this set could be seen as a send-off to lego's old design for blasters because they didn't produce the new arms for droids as of yet. Of course it would be phased out later that year when Battle Droids were given these new arms to hold the new guns. The Super Battle Droids are of course the highlight of this set. They haven't been seen since 2002 and even then they only appeared once in blue (in set 7163). Finally they return in a more accurate look with a gun metal/silver colour.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is not complex at all and can be completed in about ten minutes or less.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Overall the finished model is great. Battle Pack of course are all about the figures and not the model itself but the two vehicles are nice. Firstly the STAP bike is great, I love the transparent stand used to give it the illusion it's hovering or flying. It's also lego's best version of the STAP because lego for some reason have since then made the stand for the feet too wide with those wings parts for them. The Droid Transport is nice but very flimsy. The Droids simply just stand on the back while the driver fit in the front. It should be noted lego completely made this vehicle up, thought it's similar to the Battle Droid Carrier .&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>A great battle pack with the long awaited return of Super Battle Droids.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,5

Not only does it come with 4 regular battle droids, it also comes with three super battle droids, an awesome troop carrier and a simple but elegant STAP. This, combined with a clone battle pack, creates a pretty great battle scene. I currently only have one however I am planning on buying one more for my battle of Kashyyyk. There are two bad things about this set,though: The trooper's guns are simply megaphones with one by one circular translucent orange plates on the end. Since this set came out after the new molded guns came out, why didn't they just use them? Also, the way the droid's arms are made it makes them hold the guns sideways.

It has four normal droids and three super battle droids.  It DOES come with four guns for every droid, unlike people had said before me.  It has a STAP for a droid and a droid carrier that is NOT accurate to the movie, but that is NOT a big deal AT ALL!
  
    If you are interested in MORE lightsaber handles this comes with FOUR of them for the STAP and the droid carrier. The droid carrier fits ALL of the super battle droids and ALL of the normal droids at once.  It comes with a seethrough Lego stand for the STAP to make it look more realistic and in MY opinion it was a GREAT idea of Lego to make a Lego stand for the STAP!

To ad insult to injury, this set came like 3 weeks before the MTT, which has the new droid arms. However, this is easily fixed by going to BickLink, just buy however many arms and new blasters, or use your own.

I love the STAP.  I just wish the battle droids has been the newer ones that had one wrist turned so they could hold a blaster correctly (and this set comes with “megaphone blasters”).   The defect is with the super battle droids arms – apparently the arm peg is a little to big for the arm socket.  You’ll notice it’s a tight fit when you put the arm on.  I have had 3 arms break in different sets.  They weren’t dropped or played with but the arms just developed a crack and eventually broke around the arm socket.   I have since taken a small jewelers file and shaved down the arm peg’s diameters a little (I was afraid to increase the arm sockets diameter because that is where the break is occurring).

"PaulTR","2011-06-02T15:07:05.983Z","These Are the Droids You're Looking For!","<p>I didn't really know about this set until my parents bought it for me a few years ago. After building it and playing with it for years, I found this set to be one of the best battle packs released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7654 is a decent set as far as looks go. The armored vehicle looks rather simplistic, and is not SW canon, but this fact can be forgiven, as it does look like something the CIS would deploy. The STAP vehicle is a nicely constructed little addition; I was very pleased with its appearence, as it does closely follow the movie. The brown coloring for both vehicles looks good,&nbsp;although it may be at odds with the grey/bluish coloring of newer CIS LEGO sets.&nbsp;Overall, I thought the set as a whole looked decent, if a bit too&nbsp;simple; then again, this is set is marketed as an&nbsp;army builder, not really a ""paegent queen"" set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The construction of the set was quick and simple. The main&nbsp;vehicle is&nbsp;very simply made, with sloped brown pieces comprising the back half, and a&nbsp;turntable piece with a small turret&nbsp;taking up the front.&nbsp;The STAP vehicle, in my opinion, is a bit more interesting: A&nbsp;clear piece supports the&nbsp;vehicle, while a droid pilots it with only his hands attached&nbsp;to a small hinge piece; his feet then rest on a&nbsp;piece using the SNOT (Studs Not On Top) technique&nbsp;facing towards the rear.&nbsp;It's a very clever little design, and probably my favorite part of the set, outside of the droids.&nbsp;As far as pieces go, you don't get many new items: Brown sloped pieces, some grey platforms, battle droid parts, and a few clear pieces. However, with that being said, you do get 7 battle droids (4 regular, 3 super), which is more minifigs&nbsp;than any other battle pack set.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;you do get a good amount of useful lightsaber pieces in grey,&nbsp;a few multi-colored megaphones (you can never have&nbsp;enough of those!), and a very&nbsp;handy&nbsp;dark&nbsp;grey&nbsp;ring-piece from the front of the armored vehicle.&nbsp;So, while most of the pieces are rather&nbsp;normal, there are a few goodies within the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability of this set is very low, although it is higher than the other battle packs. You can turn the turret on the vehicle, angle the guns,&nbsp;load up your droids, and even skid the smooth-bottomed repulsor craft across a table. As a side note,&nbsp;it's fun to play&nbsp;""Droid bowling"" with the repulsor craft&nbsp;and the droids, with the hard-to hit&nbsp;STAP acting as bonus points (Hey! Don't give me weird looks!&nbsp;I'm still a kid at heart, okay?)&nbsp;The droids themselves, which are the main draw of the set, are your typical droid figs with megaphone blasters; some may find the megaphone blasters&nbsp;and the droid's&nbsp;lack of ""straight"" arms&nbsp;annoying, as&nbsp;more recent&nbsp;droids use LEGO&nbsp;blasters and ""straight"" arms to hold them; however, this set was made before those pieces came out,&nbsp;so you can't really blame TLG. Personally, I'm not bothered by it, as someone's gotta&nbsp;drive the STAP :) The super battle droids are definitely the stars of this set: The figs look great, and their specialized arms and legs open up all sorts of possibillities for hybrid droids.&nbsp;The price per piece ratio is also&nbsp;fair, at $10 US dollars for 102 pieces; indeed, it has the most pieces out of any battle pack set, so at least you're not getting cheated out of your hard-earned cash.&nbsp;Now, on to the list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Useful vehicles 
<li>-STAP cleverly designed 
<li>-More figs than other battle packs (although they are ubiquitous&nbsp;droids) 
<li>-Affordable 
<li>-Useful pieces, such as lightsabers&nbsp;in grey</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Armored vehicle&nbsp;extremly simple to build 
<li>-Hardly any new pieces 
<li>-Not many ""play"" features</li></ul>
<p>In the end, this set is a fantastic army builder. The sheer amount of droids&nbsp;that&nbsp;are included, the STAP vehicle, and the affordable price are the set's best points; indeed, I consider this one of the best battle packs&nbsp;LEGO has released!&nbsp;While&nbsp;I would have liked to see a few&nbsp;special guns or maybe a&nbsp;pair of Droidekas in place of the repulsor vehicle, I&nbsp;still think this is a great little set. I would highly recommend it for both SW fans and army builders. Who knows? These just might be the droids you're looking for ;)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheap sets that offer up a certain number of Mini-Figures for your Separatist Armies is basically what the Battle Packs are. (Or Rebel/Imperial/Republic Armies depending on the Mini-Figures.) This Battle Pack was a hot ticket item when it first came out perhaps more so than the Clones because of the sheer number of Mini-Figures included with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you get to build in this set? One small sized Droid Carrier, one STAP and of course the Battle Droids and Super Battle Droids. You get 7 Mini-Figures in this set, four regular Battle Droids and three Super Battle Droids. The Droid Carrier is built fairly nicely, but the STAP was a really great new take on the build and I enjoyed it a little more than the Droid Carrier. Although the Droid Carrier gets a few extra points for not using the old rod style of transport for the Battle Droids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Battle Droids were given the older style Space themed blasters, two extra for the pilots, and they didn't yet include the straight arm for holding the blasters properly, but depending on how many sets you do buy from year to year that includes Battle Droids you could potentially have enough spares to replace some of the arms on these ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Super Battle Droids are a much nicer colored plastic compared to the lighter blue of the first iteration. These ones have a more mechanical looking and smoother tone appearance due to the nature of the colors chosen in their casting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I picked up 3 of this Battle Pack and I was not dissapointed, had I been able to get 4 of them as I originally planned I think it would look even more impressive on display with the four STAPs flanking the four Droid Carriers. Overall I recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Troop Building cheaply.

Seeing as this was my very first Star Wars set which I got back in 2007, a bunch of battle droids seemed like a good way to get started. The battle droids are pretty cool, and they make super good army builders. The super battle droids are very impressively detailed, and look much better in the titanium metallic color than the metallic sand grey. They also make good army builders, and I find it hard to keep track of how many of those and battle droids I have now.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The STAP:</b></div><div>Not bad for a 2007 version. It's a little stunted compared to the movie version, methinks, but it's pretty good. The 2012 version (which I do not have) is a whole lot better.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Troop Carrier:</b></div><div>Even though this vehicle didn't show up in the movies, it carries three battle droids (including the pilot) and all three super battle droids.

"Spartan022","2019-03-29T09:53:22.65Z","One of the Best Battle Packs","<p>The Droid Battle Pack remains to be one of the best Battle Pack sets ever released. Having 7 figures which include 3 Super Battle droids is amazing, and great value for money. The STAP is designed simply but well, and stands well on its own with a plastic base. The Troop Carrier itself leaves a bit to be desired, buts its design allows for a droid to sit nicely in the cockpit, and for two blasters to be stored in it. The Troop Carrier can easily fit all of the Super Battle Droids and Battle Droids too, (assuming one is on the STAP and one is in the cockpit). Overall its a great set and contains great figures and great playability possibilities.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

"DancingDinosaurs","2019-11-20T04:50:35.797Z","One of the Best!","<p>People like to rag on modern battle packs. They complain about the lack of &quot;true army builders&quot;, as most battle packs now have 1 or 2 of the minifig slots taken up by officers or other unwanted/unnecessary officers and such. Of course, they are correct. The new battle packs absolutely do deserve criticisms. However, it saddens me to see people romanticize the &quot;days of old&quot; yet look past this battle pack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set came out along with 7655 back in 2007. Being the first battle packs, LEGO sure did start off strong. Both sets were incredible, and both had great figures. To make up for the droids being &quot;cheap&quot; in the eyes of fans, they included 4 B1 Battle Droids, and 3 B2 Battle droids. This was truly a droid army builder&#39;s dream! 7 droid figures for the price of $9.99! Why not pick it up? It was truly a hidden gem among Star Wars sets as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps some day, people will look back and see it&#39;s true beauty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>- Good number of figures</p>

<p>- Fun vehicles</p>

<p>- Was a great way to get B2 Super Battle Droids</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons&nbsp;</p>

<p>- B1 Battle Droids have 2 curved arms, unfortunate, as the straight arms were released the following year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Though the vehicles are fun, the build may be boring to some.</p>

"Captainfives1514","2023-02-26T12:05:07.647Z","One of many","<p>I got this set in a bucket of LEGOs for Christmas back in 2013. I built it rather quickly but realized I was missing the super battle droids for this set. I was able to get some super battle droids later to complete the minifigure selection in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>B-1 Battle Droid.&nbsp;</strong>You get four standard battle droids same as the ones they make now except that they&#39;re blaster arm isn&#39;t rotated eighty degrees. They carry the old megaphone blasters</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>B-2 Battle Droid.</strong>&nbsp;You also get four super battle droid In gunmetal grey. They&nbsp;are the same ones that have been made for years. LEGO appears to have discontinued making them however and these droids are beginning to command a high price on the aftermarket.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Build&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;First you build a STAP for one of the B-1 battle droids to ride on. Then you build the troop carrier. There are no moving parts or interesting pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Overall&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the sets that started the battle pack era. It&#39;s a great army builder and an excellent source for battle droids. I wish LEGO would go back to making two battle packs a year with opposing forces to choose from. This is a great set and if you can find it I would highly recommend adding it to your collection.</p>
