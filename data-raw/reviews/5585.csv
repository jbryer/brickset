The turret is accurate and an interesting design. The bike is nice, with 2 seats to accomodate your troops. The shocktrooper is excellent, as are the other figures. Like clones? Get this set.

I got 2 of these and I noticed something... the paint on the clones are kind of smudged I'm not really sure how to explain it. It is also expensive. I think this should be 7$ instead of 10$.

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-04-14T03:36:30.773Z","Beautiful, but is it worth the money?","My Dad got me this set months after I first wanted it. For some reason or another, all the clone battle packs ahd been swiped clean off shelves when around 20 of the droid variety remained. I wondered: is this set better? The odds seemed unlikely: it has a mere half the number of pieces but costs just as much as the droids battle pack, and 24.95 SGD is a tad pricey for me. However, the molding of the blasters and helmets, as well as the crazy-cool paint job on the troopers just about justifies the set. The battle station and speeder are very, very simple, but use great pieces and aren't too bad at all. It's the figs that we're after, right? This set is a dream, and, despite the awful price-per-parts ratio, is one very worth chasing. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

However, I found that the parts of the turret can be used to built a more beefed-up single seater version speeder.

There are four figures: a Shock Trooper, a Star Corps Trooper, and two regular clone troopers. I actually got two Shock Troopers, because my dad ordered one along with the set. The Shock Troopers are great, with a mixture of red and white, and both come with a blaster rifle. The Star Corps Trooper has some yellow markings on his helmet and torso, and the two regular clones are completely white(albeit the obvious black marks). All the figures are very neat, and all come with at least one blaster or blaster rifle.
The speeder is small but nice. It can seat two people, one to drive and one to shoot. There are two small megaphone blasters on either side of the speeder. There are three ""engine"" pieces: one at the front of the speeder and two on either side of the end. Eventually, the speeder is made up of two parts: the main body where the clone troopers sit and a small, thin front, made up of an engine, a couple of base plates, and two long ""cannon"" pieces.
The gun turret is nothing special. It has a small piece on top in which a blaster can be put in. Then it`s got a base plate for the gunner to stand on.
Pros:
Good figures
Shock Trooper is unique
Impressive speeder

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is nothing special, and the instructions were flawless. No mistakes.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts included were quite rare/uncommon. And are great to add to your collection. Espicially the release of the new blasters this set came with.</p>

"PaulTR","2011-06-03T15:15:21.207Z","Bring In the Clones!","<p>This set caught my eye, as it was one of the first SW&nbsp;battle pack sets released. I bought it at my local Walmart at 20% reduced price; I&nbsp;have played with it regularly since then, and am very pleased I made the purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7655 is a decent looking set. The BARC speeder looks nice, if a bit too simplistic; the older BARC speeder from the original Clone Turbo tank is much superior to this iteneration, in my opinion. Also, the little turret, while a nifty little design, is nothing mind-blowing. Buuuuut, with that being said, this set is marketed as a&nbsp;minifig army building set, so you can't really get indignant at LEGO for not including massive tanks or huge turrets. Also, the figs do look nice: the Shocktrooper's armor is a&nbsp;lovely shade of red, and even his back sports a bit of red detailing. The rare&nbsp;clone commander, while not a new fig, is also a great addition with his yellow detailing and small, printed command pauldron. Overall, this set is not a complete bummer when it comes to appearences, although I will say&nbsp;its&nbsp;opposing set, the&nbsp;Droid Battle Pack,&nbsp;has much better-looking ""vehicles.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building time and techniques for this set were quick and&nbsp;simple. The BARC speeder can be thrown together in as little as a minute, while the turret can be made faster than it takes you to put on your socks (don't quote me on that, though ;) Of the two, I actually like the turret's build better than the speeder; the turret uses a nifty little wheel-hub piece to get a nicely curved stand. By comparison, the speeder is a platform with some engine pieces and X-wing lasers thrown on it. But at least you get some very&nbsp;useful parts, such as engine blocks,&nbsp;Republic Red pieces, and&nbsp;4 (when released) new blasters.&nbsp;However, this does not change the fact that you only get 58 pieces with the set, meaning&nbsp;the set is more appropriate as a $5 US dollar set rather than a&nbsp;$10 US dollar set.&nbsp;I think the price would have been a bit more justifiable if there were 5 clones&nbsp;instead of 4,&nbsp;and they were equipped with some extra guns or accessories. But on the other hand, Episode 3 clones&nbsp;were/are a bit hard to come by, so this set includes some fairly rare SW figs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is&nbsp;decently fun to play&nbsp;with, although there are no ""action"" features.&nbsp;You can load up&nbsp;2 clones on the BARC speeder to conduct recon missions, and you can&nbsp;swivel the turret's little blaster.&nbsp;Besides that, there's not much&nbsp;else&nbsp;to do. But once again, the clones save the day! Since there are&nbsp;4 of them, they make a nice little squad; to&nbsp;tell the difference between the two standard clones, I usually&nbsp;give one of them the larger blaster and the other one the smaller blaster. You can have lots of fun&nbsp;sending the clones on missions against their opposing 7654 Droid Battle Pack enemies (if you have that set),&nbsp;but I just feel the set could've done with&nbsp;some extra features.&nbsp;I would even have been fine if LEGO threw in a flick-fire missile&nbsp;on the turret, so you could at least have some action feature; as it stands, this set actually has the least ""action"" features out of&nbsp;any of the SW&nbsp;battle packs, so I must rate the playability&nbsp;very low:( All righty, let me hit the list!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Clones look very cool, especially the rare&nbsp;clone commander 
<li>-Turret design&nbsp;is interesting 
<li>-Includes&nbsp;rare&nbsp;Episode 3 clones 
<li>-Useful&nbsp;pieces, such as engine parts and blasters</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Very simplistic 
<li>-A bit pricey 
<li>-No action features 
<li>-Hardly any accesories</li></ul>
<p>All in all, I would recommend this set to die-hard SW fans and&nbsp;army builders looking for Ep. 3 clones, but not really anybody else. The lack of&nbsp;pieces, lack of action features, and&nbsp;general simplicity of the&nbsp;vehicle set it a bit further back in the pack when compared to other battle packs. Still, the clone figs&nbsp;do a good job of&nbsp;salving the wound,&nbsp;so the set isn't a total loss; after all, who couldn't use more clones :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set includes two buildable items, a small weapons platform for the Shock Trooper and a two man BARC Speeder. (I assume it is a BARC Speeder.) The pieces used aren't too new from what I can see, and the construction is simple and fun, but I think the real attention grabber from this set is in fact the Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few curiosities about this set. First of all, rather than give a regular steering handle piece LEGO uses two small black individual pieces (not sure what they're called) to make a steering device that concievably falls apart quite easily. Also, the Clone piloting this thing can't store his blaster anywhere. So he's holding his blaster while driving, not exactly proper Speeder etiquette for Clone Troopers. (LOL)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO gave us the new blaster pieces in this set, but not the Droids Battle Pack, an odd choice, but I assume it was so they could include more Mini-Figures in the set. (Depending on cost of Droid body parts compared to new blaster pieces.) Four clones does not an army make, but buy three or more of this bad boy set and you're set up with a little defensive perimiter for your larger Clone sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printing on the clones is nice too, with unique coloring for two of them to give us the Shock Trooper and... a Clone Commander? I believe all four of them were double-sided torsos as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this set is definitely worth picking up. The Clones don't have any individual faces, but that isn't really a must have, I think five Mini-Figures in total might have made a slightly better option for Troop Building, but then again Four is an even number whereas five is uneven... So I guess it's a toss up. I highly recommend this set to every LEGO Star Wars enthusiast, even if you can only get one it will enhance your larger Clone sets, including the Clone Turbo Tank or AT-OT Walker quite nicely. Every battlefield needs a defensive perimiter to deal with pesky assassin or infiltration units.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Clone Troopers Battle Pack has a box that appears to show a lot of action on the art. There&#39;s nothing special compared to other sets in that year.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 58 parts in this set, there&#39;s nothing special except for the blasters which were new at the time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This battle pack comes with 4 minifigures: 2 normal clones, 1 Star Corps Clone, and 1 Shock Trooper. All of them come with front and back printing, which seems fairly accurate. Unfortunately, there is no leg printing or faces on the heads, which are all black. These figures would be good but the new Phase 2 troopers are much better.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very short, emphasis on short, not much to note here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I find that the model is not very stable, especially the speeder. Mine falls apart very often.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Playability: 7/10 Fairly swooshable, but there is nothing for the Clone Troopers to shoot.</p>

<p>Design: 5/10 Breaks all the time, like I mentioned before.</p>

<p>Price: 9/10 $10 for a battle pack is great!</p>

<p>Minifigs: 6/10 Overshadowed by the new clone troopers.</p>

<p>Overall: 27/40</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>- Some interesting kind of exclusives but overall not a lot of parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>- Nice 4 Clone Troopers: A Star Corps Clone Trooper (has orange printings), a Shock Trooper (has red printings) and 2 basic phase 2 Clone Troopers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a good set for play, okay for play. Best for building an army.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I recommend this set for Episode 3 collectors and Clone Army builders. It&acute;s a good battle pack to both, kids and collectors.</p>

"lego_by_ben","2017-01-31T19:23:10.147Z","Nice Old Battle Pack","<p>I had this set and recently rebuilt it, so now I will write a review for it. Overall I rated it a 4, because it&#39;s a fun and simple set that brings me to simpler times. It&#39;s also great for building armies 10 years ago. Building experience is the worst factor, it&#39;s very simple, but the turret looks nice. The speeder looks less cool, but it isn&#39;t horrible. I rated parts a 2, because it only has 58 pieces, with only <strong>37</strong> actually going into the actual models! Back in the day, most people probably weren&#39;t buying these for the builds or pieces. I rated it a 4 on playability, because the turret is fun to put the Shock trooper in and his rifle, and allowing him to blast away at droid enemies. The speeder is also pretty swooshable, and it seats two clones, allowing you to perhaps drop one off at the battlefield and race away to pick up another. The minifigs are great too. They are all classic phase 2 clones. Two are normal clones, one&#39;s a shock trooper, and one is a star corps clone. These clones are the main reason you&#39;d buy the set. Value for money is a 3 from me because the clones make it worth its price (MSRP). It&#39;s a good set, but I would just recommend you buy the clones seperately from Bricklink and maybe piece together the rest of the set I you want the build. It&#39;s not worth it to buy it on eBay or similar sites.</p>

"shady40","2020-08-01T16:00:45.597Z","Good, but not as a single set","<p>The whole set is pretty enjoyable with other sets from 3rd episode, but kinda lacks playability as a single set (Basically nothing to do with it), so I strongly recommend using this set eg. to fill empty seats in sets like 7671 AT-AP Walker or 8091 Republic Swamp Speeder with its minifigures.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- Nice set of minifigures included</p>

<p>- Low price</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- Lacking playability as a single set</p>

<p>- Poorly designed speeder, results in low durability</p>
