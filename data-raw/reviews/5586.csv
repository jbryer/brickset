"greg_duncan","2006-12-18T19:15:49Z","one for your collection","Being a huge fan of General Grievous, I was looking forward to getting this as soon as I heard it was coming out in 2007. I had huge expectations for this little starfighter, and the good people at the Lego Company met them and then some. The set includes the General Grievous from the chase set minus the cape, including four lightsabers and a new blaster pistol, which is a major improvement over the megaphones we’re so used to.
	The ship is not a huge set in itself, and the parts do not take up a lot of space in the box, but the detail that designers put into this set is incredible. The colour scheme is just about right, with the body being dark grey with tan and black highlights, and the stripes on the body are just great. The cockpit is the best par of the set, with a sliding cockpit that is incredibly secure and fitting for this ship. I suppose the set could have gotten away with a hinged cockpit like the A-wing, but the sliding construction is one of the best features I have seen in a while.
	This set is a very good interpretation of the ship with no name, and worth the 20 bucks, though it only has one minifigure. It is definitely a good one for fans of the General, and does his fighter the justice it deserves.

Nice weapons (a blaster and 4 lightsabers). I love the way the cockpit opens but it keeps breaking off.

"Evilnurn","2007-03-19T00:00:47.14Z","Very well done","Buying sets today I had a lot of trouble deciding which I wanted. I finally took home this one and was extremely impressed. First of all, I applaud Lego for their use of simplicity over functionality in this set, a departure which I was disappointed with. The colors and pieces are simplistic and accurate, which I would much prefer to something with lights or sounds.

Next, the set works very well with itself, especially the sliding cockpit mechanism. They allowed for a place to stow lightsabers, which annoyed me in past sets where they give you an extra feature beyond the ship but it cannot be stowed anywhere (like the A-Wing or B-Wing for example). General Grievous, of course, is a marvel in minifigure engineering.

I loved this set, and found it as easily the best set of 2007. The $20 might scare you, as its not too much brick for your buck. But I was very impressed, to say the least.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paul007","2007-05-07T10:47:44.623Z","Well built sturdy set","This starfighter is one of the sturdiest I have ever seen come out of lego.  You can drop it and the only thing that will come off is the 'rudder' on the back.  One of the nicest features on this ship is the opening cockpit, but the color scheme matches with the movie.  The guns tilt up and back, but I don't see any reason why they should.  Grevious will NOT fit into the cockpit with all of his arms on, just the top two, but droids and Minifigures fit perfectly fine.  The bottom is roomy enough that if you take the lightsaber rack off, you can build a bomb bay so that it becomes the CIS 'Strike Bomber' from battlefront 2.  This is a very good set, and is very sturdy.  I would recomend it.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tauntaunwampa","2007-08-09T05:59:56.647Z","Must Have for all Grievous Fans","This set is pretty good the scale is good and if you want to you can modify it and it wont break the only problemo is that where Grievous sits it is too thin and it breaks easily I have heared from alot of people that he needs a cape that is true but LEGO thinks that it takes a long time to get the cape of to fly in his starfighter that is the only thing that this set really needs to have.
lego could also have put his magna guards in it because grievous needs some protectors instead of just super battle droids and finally the cockpit. THe cockpit could have had a bit more attention yes it is easy and cool to use but it wont fit grievous in properly im sure many of you will agree with me.

"omgbrick","2007-12-22T14:21:47.653Z","Lightsaber bomb's?","General Grievous star fighter although it wasn't seen that much in the movie from what I can tell is very accurate compared to the movie. The ship is also well built and very swooshable.
There is one instruction manual for this set, and the bags aren't numbered. The build is simple and straight forward you build the main body and cockpit first then finally the wing pieces. It also includes general Grievous with four lightsabers (grey hilt) and a new blaster piece. Grievous doesn't have a cape which is good since other wise he wouldn't fit in his ship.
The set has three main features the first is the sliding cockpit. The windshield and the large grey part in the middle of the ship are built so they can slide back and forth along the ship. Under the large grey part there is a clip that connects part of the ship to prevent the windshield from falling off during flight the feature works well and is very secure so it’s still swooshable. The second feature is the tail; it can fold down via a click hinge and act as landing gear. The last feature are the two guns on the side that can rotate.
There’s enough room in the cockpit for Grievous's to sit however he has to sit with his blaster in his lap and his lightsabers have to go on the bottom of the ship which makes the ship look odd and almost as if they were some sort of bombs. 
Overall for 25 dollars this is a good set as it has many features and a good assortment of pieces for space fans. Its only flaw is the lightsaber placement, but that can be overlooked. 5/5

The ship uses a good variety of pieces and looks very sleek. The grievous figure is ok, but the ship steals the show. I love how it comes with 4 lightsabers and a blaster. The build is finished before you realized it had started, but that just means you get to enjoy the ship that much sooner. It also has one of the best cockpits I have ever seen, it slides back and forth and locks into place when you want it to. I wish other ships would use this design as it greatly improves the cockpit. For only 25$ us, you can't go wrong, and this sleek new set certainly doesn't. I've heard complaints that the cockpit pops it is a very miniscule problem and I hadn&quot;t even noticed it until someone pointed it out in a review.

-Very good-looking.
-Sturdy.
-Cheap, and worth the price.

-Soulless One has no controls.
-The rudder can't turn, and instead is I believe incorrectly labeled as tail landing gear.
-The Grievous minifigure is colorless, has legs that can't independently move and arms that can't pose very well (probably not big cons to most people, but to a brickfilmer like me it is a pretty big problem, probably the biggest for me since I have the Grievous with the cape and don't care much about controls in this ship.)

The price was not to high for the kit you get, although the bricks take up very little space in the box, perhaps making the kit look bigger than it is once built, trying to justify the &#163;20 price tag.  Once built the ship is well constructed, and looks great.  The sliding cock pit is a nice touch, and contary to previous reviews Grevious does sit in there with the cock pit closed.

The few flaws are, 1. I thought more effort good have been put into Grevious himself, he is plain white with no cloak.  2, his 4 light sabers are slung under the ship and are prone to bening knocked off.  A compartment in the ship for them would have been better, although it may have to have been bigger though out to incorporate them.

Right. Straight onto what I think is bad. Firstly, the 'sliding cockpit' feature is one of the worst mechanisms that Lego have ever produced. It worked for about two days before it started mucking up, and now whenever I try to slide it, the whole thing ends up breaking off. So, now I just remove the cockpit piece. It's way easier and less time consuming. Another thing that is kinda dumb are the parts underneath the jets. I know that they are necessary but I think that they could have done much better. Honestly, they're just big black spikes with brown bumps on them. They are extremely ugly and I can't stand them. And something else that disadvantages the whole star-fighter is that with them you can't completely take the star-fighter out of landing mode.

Now, onto what is actually good about this set. The General Grievous mini-fig is a welcome bonus as General Grievous is one of my favorite Star Wars characters ever. Also the color scheme and guns are quite cool and the at least the mechanism that makes the guns tilt actually works fairly well. The light-saber rack is nice and can be stuck onto the bottom of the star-fighter itself, which is handy. The engine parts are cool too and I do like the back landing gear but as I said in the bad stuff paragraph you can't really have the star-fighter completely out of landing mode thanks to those awkward spikes beneath the jets.

You're able to slide this cockpit open and to sviwel the lasers on the sides. The fin on the back does swivel as well.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first picked up this set I was feeling very pleased with myself because it gave me two things, my first LEGO Grievous Mini-Figure and another impressively scaled Starfighter to do battle against my TIE. Once I got it home and started building it I was not dissapointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grievous' Starfighter uses a lot of interesting pieces to give the impression of Grievous' Starfighter in LEGO form. The way to open and close the cockpit is particularily ingenious and a far cry better than if they'd just told you to pop it on and off every time you wanted to insert Grievous into the pilots station. The laser cannons are rotatable allowing for various positions of aiming. And the rear assembly looks nice too. I would have to say that it takes roughly fifteen - twenty-five minutes to build up the bulk of the ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grievous comes with five accessories. Four lightsabers and one blaster. And the Mini-Figure looks rather nice too. The only real problem is that LEGO stopped giving us the Chromed Lightsaber hilt piece, so when he's fighting my older Anakin and Obi-Wan Mini-Figures, or Luke, he looks like he got his Lightsabers not from conquered Jedi, but Jedis-R-Us Surplus store or something. Still it is rather impressive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I was very impressed by everything about this unique and excellent looking Starfighter, there is even a small storage rack for your lightsabers when not in use. There is really nothing to improve upon in this set, unless you're looking for a cape for Grievous, but even then since this ship was in the movie for all of... One scene? And Grievous didn't have a cape in that scene it isn't a total loss. The Clone Wars has introduced a new iteration of this vessel and I have yet to pick that one up, but it looks suitably impressive. All in all I'd say if you only prefer to have one copy of the ship I can't tell you which of the two is the better deal, yet, but if you're like me, a LEGO Star Wars Completist then this set is a must have item.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I've always loved Grievous's ship, but this set sort of kills it a bit.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>The box shows a shot of the ship from an intimidating front view, flying past a planet (it looks a lot like Tatooine, which is ironic because that ship never went anywhere near Tatooine). A nice square box it was, with very small instuctions which were easy to follow.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>The selection of pieces is decent. You get a few brown and tan pieces, which I believe were somewhat uncommon at the time. Now, you see them in quite a number of Star Wars sets. The original cockpit piece is always a welcome, as are the sliding pieces that operate the cockpit. The lightsaber hilts that are used for the weapons are clever, but they are also used for Grievous's four lightsabers themselves.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigure:</b></div><div>Possibly the worst part of the entire set. Some may disagree, but the Grievous minifigure with this set is simply STUPID. I can't wait for the 2014 version, which I'm sure is better than this.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Starfighter:</b></div><div>Slightly better than the minifigure, but only slightly. It captures the look of the ship very well, but it lacks in a few areas that the 2010 version fixed tremendously. I don't like that fact that you have to slide the entire front section forward to access the cockpit, which, by the way, includes NO CONTROLS. Grievous obviously doesn't possess the power of the Force, so I guess that ruins that option. Oh well, the only time the cockpit is paid any attention is placing Grievous himself, and he fits fairly well even with all four arms. The rotating cannons on the wings are neat, and the blasters are a bit mediocre but look okay, considering they are made of lightsaber hilts. The engines on the side are pretty great for a 2007 model. A lightsaber holder is included to hold all four lightsabers, and it can be attached underneath. Even though the ship lacks, I'll admit that's a pretty good feature. At least you'll be able to carry the entire set with you that way (because the blaster would be in the cockpit with the cyborg himself). The tail folds down only. This strikes me as rather odd because in the movie as the hijacked starfighter flies into Bail Organa's Tantive IV (Obi-Wan hijacked it after Order 66 was executed, for those who don't remember), the tail actually folds upward. I suppose they couldn't find a good way to demonstrate this properly, but hopefully an even newer version of this ship will solve this issue.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 9/10 - Very good selections. Points docked for the stupid Grievous pieces.</div><div>Minifigure - 1/10 - It sucks compared to the Clone Wars version.</div><div>Grievous's Starfighter - 7/10 - It's a great ship with a few flaws.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 5.66/10. I'm sorry, the Grievous minifigure is that horrid.</div>",TRUE,3,5,4,2,4
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2021-02-12T21:39:23.303Z","Since improved on, but fair in its day and not horrible now","<p>One of the more unusual ships designed for Revenge of the Sith was General Grievous&#39; starfighter, later identified as a custom Belbullab-22 heavy starfighter named the <em>Soulless One</em>. It has a smooth look to it, with contours reminiscent of 1960s American muscle cars.</p>

<p>The ship is first seen when after finding himself unable to overpower Obi-Wan Kenobi in lightsaber combat, General Grievous decides to abandon Utapau and flees for his fighter, Obi-Wan continuing to duel with him the entire way to the landing platform and ultimately manage to kill the Grievous with the cyborg&#39;s own blaster (a kill he regrets the barbaric nature of). Later, after Order 66 is issued and triggers the Clone Troopers to turn on and hunt down the Jedi, Obi-Wan sneaks off to the unprotected Soulless One and commandeers it for his escape.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box depicts Grievous&#39; starfighter flying past the planet Tatooine, with lasers from an unseen Republic ship streaking by near him. Tatooine seems a bit of an odd choice, considering Grievous never went there in the film; Utapau would have been a more logical choice. But then, the box for this set&#39;s counterpart (7661 Jedi Starfighter and Hyperdrive Booster Ring) shows what seems to be Mustafar, so it&#39;s possible Lego were simply using random planets seen in Revenge of the Sith for the packaging at the time rather than picking planets specifically tied to the sets. The border logo at the time of this set was a stylized Lego Darth Vader head, which looks appropriately menacing.</p>

<p>Materials-wise, the box is made the somewhat heavier cardboard commonly used on sets at the time, and has the experimental semicircle resealable tabs that Lego was then trying out.</p>

<p>The instructions are very clear; nothing is too dark to see properly, there are no bad angles where a piece appears to be mounted in one place but a later step reveals the correct placement to be elsewhere. There is however one questionable step; at least one version of the instructions says to put the 1x2 door rail plates on the central slope before sliding it into place. On paper this could work as there is a 4-stud-long clear space after the drop from the brown and tan tiles, but I can see it causing trouble in practice. There are no issues beyond that.<br />
As was common at the time, the stone grays introduced in 2004 are colored more like the original light and dark grays.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is an interesting mix. Six lightsaber hilt pieces, all of them in light stone gray, two transparent blue 4L rods and two chartreuse 4L rods for lightsaber blades, various dark stone gray smooth slopes, black wing plates, brown and tan tiles, some cheese wedge slopes, a smokey version of the cockpit canopy piece originally introduced for 7141 Naboo Fighter, one of the new-for-2007 blaster pieces, and of course various odds and sods needed for a complete structure. There is no sticker sheet. I will say that pear silver lightsaber handles would have been nice if Lego wasn&#39;t going to furnish us with that many chrome handles, but they hadn&#39;t hit on that replacement at the time. A worse omission is the lack of plates or tiles to go on top of the cannons to hold them together. Given Separatist fighters&#39; use of red lasers, the use of transparent green studs for the cannons is also questionable.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>There is only one minifigure in the set: General Grievous. His design is the same one from 2005: The head (which uses a normal minifigure neck peg) and torso are new parts based off his appearance in the film, but his limbs use existing Battle Droid limb pieces. None of the parts have any printing or paint; they are also bone white rather than a more film-accurate ivory color. This is not nearly as impressive as the newer Grievous minifigure introduced in 8095, a successor to this set from the Clone Wars era, because Lego was only going so far at the time when it came to creating new specialized minifigure parts. It does however have a good point: this version of Grievous is capable of mimicking the arms separating (and I will say that paint does wonders for him). I understand why Lego did Grievous this way, although Super Battle Droid legs may have served him better.</p>

<p>Unlike the first release of this Grievous design from 7255 General Grievous Chase, this version is missing the General&#39;s cape. This is to be expected: it&#39;s a starfighter set. Lego usually doesn&#39;t include capes with starfighter sets, as they would be somewhat in the way when getting inside, and would also get rather rumpled up from the cramped cockpit confines. The only exceptions are (post-Mustafar) Darth Vader and Kylo Ren, because of how essential the capes are to their appearance.</p>

<p>For accessories, he has a quartet of lightsabers and the blaster Obi-Wan would ultimately turn against him. Sadly, there is no electrostaff.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build is a clean, straightforward job. There&#39;s nothing especially complicated about it, but nor does it hit the level of what some would call juniorized. There are some Studs Not On Top (&quot;SNOT&quot;) techniques employed, mainly in the mounting of the two fender-like engines. The most interesting thing, however, is how tile-heavy the upper surface of the center is. There is one potential hiccup, the one I discussed under Instructions.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model does a fair job looking like the Soulless one as seen in the film; the smooth slope pieces were a good choice for capturing the muscle car curves and it has brown and tan flecks appropriate to the patches of color on Grievous&#39; fighter in the movie. The engines are a bit thin lower down, the rear fin doesn&#39;t properly fold up into the body, and the cockpit shape isn&#39;t the most accurate (it was the best they could do with existing pieces), but the overall look of the fighter is correct. The front fuselage of the fighter slides forward to open the canopy and allow access to the cockpit, a compromise on the canopy itself sliding forward in the movie (which would be difficult to model accurately at this set&#39;s size). I&#39;ve seen other reviewers comment on the lack of stickers to represent controls; this sliding mechanism is why. Stickers on those tiles, even of the thin plasticized sort that LEGO uses nowadays, would risk fouling it and getting peeled or torn.</p>

<p>Grievous fits inside the cockpit, but just barely (and his arms must be in the &quot;collapsed&quot; form). The cockpit can also seat normal minifigs, which is good considering the movie; a Revenge of the Sith Obi-Wan would be an obvious choice. I would not, however, bet on it holding the more modern General Grievous minifig even with the outer arms off. If it can, that would be a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>This set&#39;s accessory storage feels a bit lacking compared to some of the 1999 and 2000 sets. There are no compartments, Grievous&#39; lightsabers are instead simply held in a rack that mounts to the underside of the ship and the blaster is left to sit in his lap in the cockpit.</p>

<p>The model&#39;s main fault is areas that are lacking in durability. It&#39;s easy for the tiles along the center to wiggle just loose enough to interfere with the canopy and central slope sliding forward. The sliding can also be fouled by alignment issues with the 1x2 door rail plates. The 1x1 pinhole bricks that hold the cannon muzzles tend to get knocked off when brushed too firmly because there&#39;s no plates or tiles on top to hold them in place (a questionable decision). The bricks of the rear fin also don&#39;t &quot;bite&quot; very well into the plates above them; a 1x3 or 1x4 plate in between may have helped with this even if it caused height problems. All the same, it&#39;s a decent and fun ship.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When this set was new, it was very cool. General Grievous&#39; fighter had yet to be made in Lego form, and this set delivered a very good first representation. Grievous himself had only been in one set thus far, and thus could very easily have been missed. This set was in essence part of a matched pair with 7661; that set provided Obi-Wan Kenobi and the fighter he used to reach Utapau, while this set provided General Grievous and the fighter that <em>he</em> attempted to use (and which Kenobi would successfully use) to <em>flee</em> Utapau. The only things missing were an electrostaff, Obi-Wan&#39;s lightsaber, and a body for R4-G9. Both sets were quite good on their own, and they made a superb package when combined. At the time, this set was excellent value for $20.</p>

<p>Nowadays, both the fighter and Grievous himself have since been outclassed. Set 8095 General Grievous&#39; Starfighter from 2010 had a more accurate and robust build, and debuted a larger, more accurate, and better-articulated Grievous with actual paint detailing. It was $50 to this set&#39;s $20, but the improvements were not inconsequential. 2020 saw the release of 75286, overall equal to 8095 in quality but Episode III oriented rather than <em>The Clone Wars</em> oriented. The price, however, is rather suspect - given the comparable build, weight, and piece count to 8095, the jump from $50 to a whopping $80 seems like blatant price-gouging (even taking inflation into account would only explain a $10 jump, not a $30 jump).</p>

<p>However, this set isn&#39;t horrible to modern eyes. It&#39;s still a decent representation of Grievous&#39; fighter (not quite on the timeless classic level of some of the 1999 and 2000 sets, but close), and Grievous himself was fair for the day. And while I&#39;ve seen it listed on eBay for a little over $60, I&#39;ve also seen listings that lean closer to $20, so it seems quite possible to obtain it today without paying too painful of a price. I think it still works well enough to be worth picking up, especially given how overpriced the 2020 version is.</p>
