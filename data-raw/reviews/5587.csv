"TheBigGuy","2007-02-03T16:46:44.893Z","Another great remake.","When it comes to songs I am not a great fan of remakes.  The original is always the best version. Same with Lego, until I built this little beauty.  Compared with this the original (which I have always liked) is bit cheap and too small.  The detail is much better in this one and the cockpit is straight from the movie.  Could have been better with a two-man cockpit and another pilot, but that doesn't detract from a superb set.  Easy to build and fun too.  I'll give this set a classy 9.5 (with half a point off for having only one minifigure)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bran_don_jin","2007-02-13T12:15:21.497Z","O.K...","This set is OK but many things could have been done better. Of course this set is better than the first, it is bigger, more detailed, and it comes with an imperial piolet.But... still no minifigures(such as stormtroopers or ewoks),there is no sheild bunker(not even a badly made one)and UNlike the first model it can't walk. It just has to sit there! There is some ways you can change this though. So overall, good set, it gets an 8 but -2 because LEGO failed to resolve some of the problems that the earlier one had.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-05-26T07:00:34.79Z","generally good, needs more detail","i've got this set and it is generally good but in my opinion it could definately use a bit more detail, plus on this picture it shows th wrong character, the clothes are correct but the face is different. i do enjoy the detail inside the head and how the top of th head opens and closes and the head spins around. So generally a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-06-04T01:58:57.793Z","A hundredfold improvement - but not exactly perfect","As compared to the very dismal version from 2000, this redesign is a spectacular improvement, into which large amounts of effort have been put in. The set is much better scale-wise, and includes distinct features left out by the previous incarnation. No detail is spared with this model, and it looks excellent on display. A neat play feature of the rotating head caps it off nicely.

However, the set certainly has it faults. The legs are completely immobile and the &quot;walker&quot; is completely incapable of &quot;walking&quot; of any sort. The legs also lack the spindly feel which it is meant to posses, and feel far too blocky. Some portions, particularly the side-mounted guns, are prone to falling off often. The interior is poorly designed, with room for just one. This problem is also hard to solve even with modifications. The walker also fails to look menacing enough. 

Thankfully, though, the lone minifigure is gloriously designed, and the set is a lot more movie-accurate than its predecessor on the whole. Get it on sale if possible, just like I did.

While physicallt not that much larger than the older version, the model scales better with the minifig provided due, in no small part, to the larger more detailed head design.  While the legs no longer 'walk', the model balances better: the old version always seemed to be leaning back slightly.

"Paul007","2007-04-09T07:20:35.053Z","Best medium set","In my opinion, this is the best medium sized set lego has ever made.  The only bad thing about it is that in star wars, the AT-ST had two drivers seated next to each other, not just one.  The cabin has room for two men, but seated behind each other.  Many people complain about the legs, but they move very realisticly.  It was nicknamed 'Chicken Walker' by the rebels because of the odd way the legs moved.  At all times, the nose turret was the formost part in the AT-ST, and the legs NEVER went forward.  This is a very realistic model and is a great bargain for the price.  10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Ovid07","2007-09-04T15:49:38.41Z","Huh.","Thanks to whoever rated my review of set #4950 The Loader-Dozer.  Like I said in that review I'm putting more work into my reviews now, so if you find one of use use the &quot;Did you find this review useful?&quot; rating system.  - Ovid07(David)

INTRO
When I found out about Lego re-doing the AT-ST, I was really happy.  All true Star Wars nerds know that the joke of an AT-ST Lego released back in 2000 or so, was horrible.  And that's why we hate it.  Even today  when I hear a shuffling sound approaching me and a weird gray blocky blob off on the horizon I  scream and run for cover.  So did Lego do it right this time?  Read on and find out.

LOOKS
On the outside this is a beautiful set.  Matter of fact when I first saw it on Lego.com, I really thought Lego had done it.  RE-BUILT! THE! HORRIBLE! GOOD-FOR-NOTHIN'! AT-ST!  However, after my first encounter with it (at a friend's house) I had a mixed bag of feelings.  It looked good on the outside but the &quot;command cabin&quot; was just a chair and a clip to put the pilot's gun.  I mean first off a real AT-ST has two pilots, and second where are the controls?  Is this a special telekinesis powered AT-ST?  4/10 for a beautifully crafted outside, with a lousy interior.

SIZE IN REALTIONS WITH COPPERATE MARKETING
The Outside: is in good scale with an AT-ST
The Inside: could use another pilot (like I mentioned earlier).  6/10.

FEATURES
The AT-ST has a great head swivial feature, using technic gears!  8/10.

MINIFIGS
The AT-ST pilot is great.  I know Lego can do things like this right off the bat (they don't have to use stupid decals or paint), but ya still gotta appreciate him.  The legs and body are an easy build, but the helmet's a new SW piece and it didn't end up like Watto*'s body.  I know there should be two AT-ST pilots, but there aren't two seats ether.  7/10.

OVERALL
If you average out all the ratings you get 6.25 (told you I was a nerd, or maybe I didn't, did I?). However, that doesn't really tell the full story.  After multiple viewings of this set I have not yet been convinced to buy it, nor probally will in the future.  So if I don't even own this set why did I review it?  Did I want just to write a long rant?  Or just want to review a popular set?  I wanted to help you make your decision.


*Foot Note: Watto:  A minor character in Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantomenace (for more info go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watto).  Also in Lego set #7186: Watto's Junkyard (for more info on that set go to http://www.brickset.com/detial.aspx?Set=7186-1).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"millacol88","2007-11-26T16:02:41.327Z","Cheap, Looks good, Accurate","This set, as the title implies, does not cost much(just over 25$ canadian.) For such a small set, the new at-st is very movie accurate. The at-st is balanced well and is quite sturdy( although if you press down too hard on its head you will have some minor rebuilding to do. The at-sts legs are static, which is a good thing as if they were movable it probably wouldn't balance very well. The cockpit is pretty cramped and sometimes it is frustrating to get the pilot in his seat. Speaking of the pilot, it is a great minifigure,with a very drab, imperial-looking outfit, a cool hat, and a flesh-toned head complete with sunglasses. I also love the new molded guns, they are a big improvement over the megaphones of old. However, at the risk of sounding like a hardcore fanboy, the at-st has two pilots in the movies but this set only comes with one. The build is, as expected, quite short, involving many light grey pieces. Despite a couple of shortcomings, this at-st is worth the price you pay and more.

Pros:
-Great minifig
-Movie accurate
-some pretty unique pieces
-doesn't cost much

Cons:
-legs are a bit fragile when pressure is applied to head
-Should come with two pilots.

  The head is a wild card with a trapdoor to function as the top hatch.Behind the head there are vent pieces.On one side there is a pulse cannon(I think) and the other side has a blaster cannon(I think) compromised of a binocular piece.The cockpit isn't movie realistic since it only fits one pilot.There are no controls for him and only a red piece.Two convenient features are the gun holder and a place for the pilot to hold onto to see the area.The two flaps that act as eyes are pretty bad and should be different.

<p>This set is absolutely brilliant, I got it on eBay for $15.00 Australian Dollars which is about $14.00 US dollars and I'm amazed at the value for money I got, but I'm not so sure for those who paid full price. Anyway this set caught my attention because I collect Hoth sets and this one was the only <em>NEW </em>set that didn't come with chewbacca as a pilot, this one was the real deal Imperial AT-ST Driver.</p>
<h4>It's playability:</h4>
<p>It's playability, is bad, it doesn't have that many features. It's head turns, and that's about it. It's legs <em>don't</em> move, unless you want to move them backwards.</p>
<h4>Minifigs:</h4>
<p>It comes with one minifig, not that great but never-the-less at least it's not chewy. The Imperial AT-ST Driver is basically a Death Star Trooper, crossed with General Veers with a weird looking torso. He also comes with a gun which is nice. Would have been nice to have a few Snowtroopers.</p>

"unleashed","2011-01-01T11:54:21.003Z","This Lego AT-ST fails to amaze me with a few missing things.","This Lego AT-ST failed to amaze me due to a lack of important features. For one thing, you can't move the legs back unless you've already moved them forward. This kills good playablility. It also wasn't wise to include a single minifig, it should have came with two AT-ST Drivers (Driver and Gunner), and maybe a few Ewoks. Background extras (Trees, catapults) would have been a good choice. I don't think Lego has ever made a good AT-ST, except for the UCS, but that was for display!",FALSE,3,4,5,3,4
"PaulTR","2011-06-02T23:40:25.22Z","A Chicken of a Walker","<p>The original AT-ST set that LEGO released was very odd-looking and was not popular in the least. With the release of the 7657 AT-ST, LEGO hoped to erase that memory, and&nbsp;I must say, they've done a&nbsp;good job. However,&nbsp;I'm disappointed that TLG didn't take this set from a ""good"" set to a ""great"" set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is definitely&nbsp;an improvement from the old one as far as appearences goes.&nbsp;The&nbsp;weapons and color scheme are much better, and&nbsp;I'm also pleased with the twin window&nbsp;hatches, which, while not functional, do an excellent job of&nbsp;imitating the canon version. With that being said, though, this set is not entirely&nbsp;movie-accurate: The cockpit is not sloped, and the anti-infantry blaster&nbsp;on the side seems like an after-thought. Also,&nbsp;I wish the designers could've improved the legs, as they are too squarish. The&nbsp;walker's profile from the front is also not very&nbsp;accurate, as the ""real"" version is nicely sloped on the sides.&nbsp;But I don't mean to sound&nbsp;too harsh; this set is definitely recognizable as an AT-ST, and it does look mean. It's just that I wish LEGO&nbsp;would've put a little more effort into the design to make it truly exceptional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build for the AT-ST is a bit bland, but it gets the job done. The walker's legs are hinge pieces attached to a&nbsp;gearbox, with the cockpit on top; the legs are supported by coming into contact with tile&nbsp;pieces, which prevent them from moving. The entire set is actually very sturdy, which is a plus. However, I fear that&nbsp;its a little too simple of a design. The interior is sparse, with only&nbsp;a chair, a clip for the driver's gun, and a&nbsp;translucent red grate to serve as&nbsp;controls (A hot grill for controls? Huh?)&nbsp;Also, the pieces did not really impress me: There are plenty of grey and dark&nbsp;grey pieces, but nothing really that we haven't seen before. Now, I understand that&nbsp;AT-STs are supposed to be grey; I just think it would have been nice if a control panel or&nbsp;two was thrown in to break up the monotony of monochronism&nbsp;(Ooo, that&nbsp;almost rhymed! :) Also,&nbsp;I think LEGO got lazy with the legs: They are rather boring, and I think&nbsp;a few Technic pieces could have spiced them up.&nbsp;However, it's not all bad news;&nbsp;I do like the driver fig, as&nbsp;he looks like he means buisness in his Imperial helmet and black glasses.&nbsp;But in the end, one cool fig just isn't going to&nbsp;save an entire set's&nbsp;simplistic build and lack of&nbsp;interesting pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability for this set was nothing spectacular, but that really isn't the set's fault, as you can't really do much with an AT-ST. You can open the hatch on the top, rotate the head via a gear, move the guns and grenade launcher, and that's about it. A&nbsp;problem&nbsp;many people might have with this set is&nbsp;the lack of moving legs, but I would actually&nbsp;disagree; the newer AT-ST version, found in the Battle of Endor&nbsp;playset looks&nbsp;better in some regards, but&nbsp;its leg function is rather useless. So, adding a leg function would actually probably&nbsp;invite ridicule rather than awe.&nbsp;Also, the set is&nbsp;fun to pit against Rebels and&nbsp;the rotating head can quickly swivel to find targets.&nbsp;It's also fun to let snipers pop the driver out of his hatch (""Aaaah! That was a long fall! Now I'm dead!&nbsp;-Driver)&nbsp;However, I just wish the designers could have thrown in an extra driver or maybe a few stormtroopers to up the playability; the set&nbsp;seems very empty with only one minifig and a lone blaster. I'm not&nbsp;even asking for some rare Ewok figs;&nbsp;why,&nbsp;I would've been fine if they had left out the swivel-head function in favor of an unarmed Chewie fig!&nbsp;Well, I should probably just finish with a list&nbsp;before I get&nbsp;some thumbs down from people claiming I'm being too critical&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Much better&nbsp;looking than the old one 
<li>-Very sturdy 
<li>-Driver fig is very cool 
<li>-Fairly priced at 244 pieces for $20 US dollars 
<li>-Swivel function nice</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Design is not very movie-accurate 
<li>-Boring build 
<li>-Lack of cool new pieces 
<li>-Not too many ""play"" functions 
<li>-Only one fig :(</li></ul>
<p>So,&nbsp;is the AT-ST set a complete wash-out? I would&nbsp;surprisingly say ""no"". Yes, it does have many faults and it may not be&nbsp;the most appealing SW set TLG has made, but at least it is smoothly built and&nbsp;evenly-priced. Also, it's alot easier to pick up than the far-more sophisticated newer&nbsp;version, which, in itself, is not perfect either.&nbsp;I would recommend&nbsp;this set&nbsp;for any true die-hard SW fan, but not really for the&nbsp;casual builder. It's&nbsp;a true&nbsp;successor to the old version, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;easily pulls ahead into a good runner-up spot; however,&nbsp;it definintely&nbsp;doesn't pull&nbsp;ahead&nbsp;into the ""awesome set"" spot :/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3

"tkettle9719","2012-05-22T23:16:59.937Z","Imperial Walker Collection: Complete (for now)!","<p>I recently got this set at the Dallas Comic-Con for myself at the price of 40 dollars, which isn't too bad considering its age. The set looks absolutely marvelous, and is instantly recognizable to me. This may be even better than the 2009 version in the Battle of Endor set. Now, to the pros and cons.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The swivel function works absolutely perfect whenever I use it. It's a charm, and it is built<b> into</b> the actual walker, as in it's not super noticeable. &nbsp;</li><li>-I like the opening hatch on the head of the walker. It definitely helps show that many different people can operate the walker.&nbsp;</li><li>-I also like the varying weapons used here, as it adds variation into the walker. It also just looks cool.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-I wish that there was more Technic&nbsp;integration in the set with the legs to add more realistic features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>-I also feel that there are some incomplete parts that look a bit dated in design terms; they aren't horrible, but I want to fix it.&nbsp;</li><li>-The legs are almost not movable; they can move, but not to a walking position. Bad set for posing.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I've always wanted an AT-ST for myself so that I could complete my Imperial Walker army, and boy am I pleased. There are many great things about this set. Once another version is made with this head and the legs of the Battle of Endor AT-ST, nirvana will be fulfilled. Buy this, especially if you can find it at a Comic-Con.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
"Chills","2012-10-18T11:40:11.977Z","Great version of an iconic Star Wars vehicle","<p>There are 3 mini-figure scale versions of the AT-ST out there, and in my humble opinion this one is the best. I have the Battle for Endor version, and I'm familiar with the original AT-ST set. LEGO's interpretation of the chicken-walker is different with each set, but I think this one is the closest to the real thing. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First of all this set looks the most like the AT-ST from the movies. Thin legs, big boxy head, side and chin guns, big foot pads, and ""toes"" too. There is really good detail with this set. The window covers look just like the movies, the chin-gun has two ""dishes"" under it to look like the mechanism in the movies, the engine in the back, these all hark back to ROTJ. But there are some details that could be better, which will be for later in the review.<br></li><li>Pro 2: I like the ways LEGO used bricks for the sides of the head instead of vertical plates like in 8038. The sides of the head angle inward at the bottom, which the plates did well to replicate, but the bricks have the smooth sides and solid feel like an armored walker should have. The angle isn't perfect, but I like the effect better.</li><li>Pro 3: I like the clever head-turning motion of this set. 8038 has ""leg walking"" as its motion, and while a neat feature I like this one better. Overall this set has a good solid feel to it.</li><li>Pro 4: The build was fun, and straight forward. Most of the pieces are bricks and plates. The value of the set is great, reference the RRP. I bought it new and about 8 cents per piece is a bargain. Finally the AT-ST driver minifigure is a great addition to my collection. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: This set has good detail, but there are some parts that I felt could be better. The legs are pretty plain, there's not much to them and they could use more detail; also they are too thick when looking head-on. The legs should be pretty thin. Also the side-mounted guns could use more detail, more use of smaller pieces to give it the Imperial look.<br></li><li>Con 2: Like I've mentioned in other reviews I'm getting spoiled with the number of minifigures in the new sets. This one only as the solo AT-ST driver; 1 figure was normal back then but if I were buying this set now I'd like to see a couple more figures. But this is a minor point.<br></li></ul>
<p>I got this set during my Dark Ages, when I bought a set a year and bought only inexpensive ones. I think this is the best version of the AT-ST (minifigure scale) that LEGO has created. It has the best details and feel. I haven't looked on ebay or bricklink to see what these are going for, but if you can find one for a decent price I say grab it. No Endor battle scene or Hoth battle scene is complete without the venerable AT-ST.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"psychman7","2013-07-03T18:09:42.703Z","Star Wars Set #7: 7657 AT-ST","One of the great many walkers used throughout the movies, this is one of the best. This version here is the second version Lego has made, excluding the mini-models.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions</b></div><div>The box, I believe was a square box, with the vehicle standing in front of the shield generator that protected the second Death Star. The instructions are easy to read.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>Possibly the most interesting pieces here are the gearbox pieces. This piece is used for the head-rotating mechanism of the walker, and it's a very good choice. The wheel fender pieces are also an interesting pick. This set includes four (two for the feet, and two for the back of the legs) of those. The other interesting choice of pieces is the trapdoor pieces, representing the hatch at the top of the AT-ST.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigure:</b></div><div>Only one is included, unfortunately. However, it's an exclusive: an AT-ST driver. Yes, I realize it sounds lame at first, but only two were ever released in the history of Lego Star Wars, the first being this one, the second being in a planet. It's a nice figure, with awesome face printing.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The AT-ST:</b></div><div>Personally, not my favorite version of the scout walker. Not because it isn't a great set, but because it's just way too blocky. I mean, I realize Lego couldn't think of this back in '07, but the actual version sort of tapers toward the bottom. Another fatal flaw in the set is the fact that you can't really move the legs all that much. I was able to fix this by removing four plates from the part that connects the main leg to the foot. It doesn't improve the situation too much, but it fixes it a bit. But this set isn't all that bad. Some of it is really clever, like the head-rotating mechanism using the gear. That's actually a very clever idea. Another really cool feature is the use of trapdoor pieces to represent the hatch. The cockpit has a spot for the driver's gun, so he doesn't have to hold it while controlling the vehicle. Talking of the cockpit, I've always wondered when a version would be released that could hold two minifigures instead of one. It may not be possible, but it's a thought. The weapons on the pod are really cool, especially the blaster cannons at the front. The use of lightsaber pieces is great.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Very clever choices and uses.</div><div>Minifigure - 10/10 - He's an exclusive, which makes him extra-cool.</div><div>AT-ST - 8/10 - Flawed, but still nice.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 9.33/10 - A nice set overall, with a few flaws.</div>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
