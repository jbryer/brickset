"greg_duncan","2007-01-14T20:53:41Z","great model, poor features","The y-wing gets the update it deserves in this set. It looks great, it is solid and the construction is good, the details are taken care of nicely, and our generic pilot minifigure has a nice little blaster pistol. Unfortunately, the two features in this set are not that good. The missiles in this set are disappointing. You have to flick the missiles with your finger, so they hang loose and fall out with the slightest touch. Other than these two features, this set is a nice display piece, and priced a little better than the UCS one. The cockpit, I should also note, is battle droid capable, being studless, which is very nice. This set is definitely a good remake, and I would recommend it to anyone who missed the original.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"TheBigGuy","2007-02-03T16:34:59.52Z","Best one for a while","The original Y-wing was one of my favourite models but this new one surpasses that, even if only just.  The detail in the new one is better than the original with the ion cannon looking a bit more realistic and the detail in the engines superb.  As greg duncan mentioned in his reveiw the missiles are a bit annoying as are the bombs but it doesn't detract much from a great set.  I would say that this is the best set releasewd for a while, alomg with the re-released Slave I.  Overall I give this a solid 9.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-07T22:37:35.03Z","Great Set","This is an awesome set, one of the best of the new series of episode 6 sets.

Pros:

-BIG! This thing is BIG although it may not seem like it from the box.  It's over 1 foot long and not far from 1 and 1/2 feet.

-Nice piece-to-parts ratio.

-Nice new blaster and flesh-toned minfigure.

-Very realistic

-AWESOME cockpit design

-Nice R2-D4

Cons:

-Not very &quot;Swooshable&quot; because it is so long that you might want to hold it with 2 hands.

-The proton torpedoes don't launch easily.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jupiter","2007-06-11T18:13:38.17Z","Nice set but poor brick quality","I like the Y-Wing because of its functional design. I think this Lego version is much better than a lot of other Lego Star Wars sets because it does not include stickers and because the cockpit canopy is attached to the ship by means of hinges. A Lego set which requires the complete removal of the canopy or a piece of the roof (because doors are not provided, see: certain cars, trucks and trains) in order to insert a minifigure, is badly designed, in my opinion.

Only the pilot's head is pink, so it can be easily replaced by a yellow head.

After a ten-year period without buying new Lego, I recently bought 3 Star Wars sets, including this Y-Wing. I quickly noticed the poor quality of the bricks, compared to my older Lego: the figures' legs are not perfectly straight and many bricks show small faults on the surface. In the case of my Y-Wing, one of the curved white pieces from the cockpit has a dark stain, which became smaller after rubbing it with my finger for ten minutes. A more serious problem are the four white bars, used as the barrels of the four guns. Because of their poor quality, these bars are not round. As a result, they don't fit inside the grey cones. Because I am not used to having to cut pieces off of bricks in order to make them fit, I did squeeze the white bars into the grey cones. When I tried to pull two of the bars out of their cones again, I accidentaly broke the cones.

The design of this set deserves a 4 or a 5, but I'm giving it a rating of 1 because of the very poor quality of certain bricks included.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

1. the cannons above the cockpit turn too easily when swooshing

"omgbrick","2007-11-30T01:10:02.217Z","So much detail","First off when you've completed this monster the thing is huge and was very nicely detailed unlike the first Y-wing.

It took about an hour and fifthteen minutes to build. You start off by building the cockpit and the middle section the cockpit only has one of those slope with the a Death Star trench pattern on it, the pilot has no problem getting into the cockpit. 
After you've built that you build the engines thes are very detailed just like the rest of the ship and look exactly like they did in the movie. The build is simple in general but does have a few intersting technics however the instruction manual quality ins't that great in that it is hard to tell the black parts from the dark grey parts.

The finished model is both big and very swooshable as in you can easily pick it up and swoosh it around without any parts falling off. EXCEPT for the &quot;bombs&quot; and the flick fire missles though you can just simply not put them in. The droid is secularly fastened down though.
 
I think the Y-wing is worth the money though a mechanic wouldn't hurt. I give this model a four out of five only because of bad instruction quality and the bombs/missiles falling out. I suggest getting it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The y-wing looks very accurate to the starfighters seen in the original trilogy and the minifigs are great. It comes with a rebel pilot and an R2-R4 astromech droid. The assembly is a little tricky in places most notably when building the engines. This set contains a nice variety of piedes in plenty of shapes, sizes and colours, ranging from bright yellow the gray. The cockpit is very accurate and looks just like it should. The features,however, are a different story. The missiles are flickfire,and don't work very well and the bombs easily fall out.

The Y-wing Fighter is a great model and contains much detail especially on the surface rear of the cockpit. The two engines are cleverly designed.

The missiles and bombs can be annoying as they can fall out of the fighter easily. The avoid that I would suggest that you attach the bomb piece to the back end of the missile so that both stay on the plane at all times...

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-06-08T12:00:26.403Z","Awesome Y-wing!","One of the Rebellion's oldest and well-armed starfighters, the Y-wing was always around for bombing runs and light dogfighting (though the X-wing still held up that category). Its mounted ion cannons proved more than enough to disable shields or transports. In this well priced $40 LEGO its features are well represented. There are front laser cannons and a mounted ion turret which swivels well but breaks every once in a while but not often. On either side before the engines is flick fire proton torpedos which really don't fire well but i just pull them out and do the launching myself. Behind the cannon and astromech there is a tiny slot to drop a pair of bombs through then pulling a stick out of the back drops them on foes, which works well save for the sliding of the stick (during play it is easier to just hold the Y-wing where the stick is). There's a Rebel Pilot (Dutch Vander's helmet design) and an R5 unit which I took out to use with Wedge's X-wing (Wedge's R5-G8 model).

The craft was fabulously detailed, with the machinery on the dorsal aft surface realized through the newer parts LEGO started making at the time of 2005, such as the handles and 1x1 sloped tiles. Poles and brackets made up the engine struts, and a rod-based structure was put to the best effect on the engine nacelles, along with domes and cylindrical thrusters. When I'd finished, the ship looked movie realistic, and the pilot fit inside perfectly. The Droid, while nothing new technically, sat sideways rather than frontally as seen in earlier models- this started somewhat of a precedent in the Star Wars line, with the Naboo fighter and Jedi ships all showing the same sort of placement. The placing made the ship look more streamlined- I did notice that the Y-wings of old looked a little <span style=""font-style: italic;"">too</span> bulky...

Been late as a builder to start collecting. Anyway, Since this iconic fighter was first seen in the Death Star attack and with its very different design, I was hooked to get one.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Usually the size is not mentioned and for me it is important particularly for computing courier costs based on packaging size. So here it is 2.4 x 11.5 x 17 inches <br></p><p>The instruction booklet is only 1. Be careful since there are some instructions in building the part of the Y wing's wing to be correctly placed.</p><p>I was surprised to open the box and see 7 plastic bags but ""CORRECTIONS"" 2 2x 16 plates and 2 1x16 bricks (PREVIOUS ENTRY: 2 2x32 plates and 2 1x32 bricks) are not in the plastic but just in the box.</p><p>First time I encountered this thus made me assemble it ASAP.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>I like building this set because, of the detail placed on the body as well as the 2 Y wings. Especially the white frames that hold the rockets with the rear propulsion. The color mix is great as far as I am concerned and the yellow color is based on the Gold squadron in Star wars. <br>The missles on the sides are nice and placing bombs in the body is also nice.<br>No stickers and the printed one on the cockpit control is the Death Star Trench area.<br><br><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Only 2, the driver and astromech. Wished it was more but that is just pushing it I guess.</p><p><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>You start with the body then the side body attachments for the Y wing section. You will note that during the build, you have to start on 1 side of the Y wing and you will repeat the process. What I did, is just get the mirror parts while building the first one so that I wont look for it again. <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Finished it in an hour. And was very much pleased and surprised with how LEGO made this model be a great build. The swossh factor is great. It is stable. However the one that keeps falling off are the guns both fall off easily. Some might say the wings fall off, just make sure it is snapped together.</p><p>You can place a LEGO made stand at the bottom to make it look like it flying.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The Xwing is usually the very well know fighter in the SW saga but the Y wing gave the variety in the Rebel fighters that showed its oommpph during the Death Star attack even though it was unsuccessful. Now I am thinking which one to buy again. Y wing or X wing. At a good price.. definitely a Y wing.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"Chills","2012-10-18T14:14:48.283Z","Backbone of the Rebel Starfighter Corps","<p>The Y-wing is my favorite Rebel starfighter. I love the stripped-down yet heavy-duty look of the ship. There are currently 3 minifigure scale versions of this ship out there, 4 if you count the BTL-B version (Anakin's Y-wing 8037). Of the three OT Y-wings I must say this is the best example.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: I have the Y-wing from 7150, and that was the first Star Wars set I bought. I thought that Y-wing was pretty cool, but it definitely lacked detail and realism. This Y-wing 7658 has everything! It looks exactly like the movies and has the detail the original one lacked. You are taken back to the first Death Star trench run when Darth Vader tore apart the poor Y-wings. LEGO did a fantastic job with detail.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The engines are spectacular. The ribs along the sides are offset 45 degrees like they should be. The rear-main part has the cone in the right shape, the engines are also detailed with some greebles, not an easy feet, and also maintain their cylindrical shape.</li><li>Pro 3: The fuselage is greatly detailed, too. The Y-wing has all kinds of bits and pieces sticking out, it isn't smooth and finished like the X-wing. This set uses LOTS of greebles (almost as much as the Star Destroyers LOL) to create that effect. The only smooth parts, which is just like the movies, are the cockpit section and the engines.</li><li>Pro 4: The cockpit is also shaped correctly, unlike the newest version that has a rectangular cockpit, this one is wedge-shaped as it should be. There is also a good use of color in this set, light and dark greys mixed together, with white and yellow in the appropriate spots.</li><li>Pro 5: The mix of colored pieces and the greebling made this a lot of fun to build. The newest Y-wing has brown pieces on the fuselage, and I'm not sold on the use of that color; this set has the right greys and whites. The engines were surprisingly void of monotony, kudos to LEGO for that. Oh, and no stickers!<br></li><li>Pro 6: The minifigures are the exact same as the old Y-wing: Dutch Vander and his droid. However, this time Dutch gets a flesh colored head instead of LEGO yellow. If you don't have a Y-wing yet these minifigures make good additions to your collection.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: There are two things that stick out as needing work. The first is the lack of landing gear. It would have added pieces, but there is definitely room for nose gear and main gear in the fuselage. In fact all of my Y-wings suffer from this problem, but a lot of the other LEGO sets have good landing gear, this one should too.<br></li><li>Con 2: The second and final con is that I'm not a fan of the ion cannon over the cockpit. LEGO did a great job with detail throughout the ship, but the cannon looks half-finished. This could have been better designed.<br></li></ul>
<p>The two cons I mentioned are small issues. This set is overwhelmingly the best Y-wing out there, in my opinion. It has good playability (I forgot to mention the flick missiles and bombs... a nice touch), it is a solid set, designed well and swooshable. The colors are spot on, and it has great detail. One can find these sets on ebay for a good price, I got this one used, but for under RRP. This set also doesn't look dated next to modern sets like the X-wing 9493 or the Falcon 7965. If you're looking for a Y-wing for your collection I give this one two thumbs up. A really great set!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
"zipsforbananas","2012-08-28T08:07:32.61Z","Still the definitive version, and the daddy of your Rebel fleet!","<p>I know there are a multitude of reviews already, but I'll try and give a little more detail, so this might not be as redundant as it seems!</p><p><br></p><p>I'm writing this at the end of 2012 and I'm convinced this set is the definitive Y-Wing. There was an older version that was sold along with Vader's TIE Fighter a few time (<b>7150</b> and others), but it was blocky and bland, released before the relaunch-type update of style in 2006. And Lego refreshed it again in <b>2012</b>, but somehow they took a step backwards in the cockpit design, turret gun and engine detailing (just a sticker? Seriously?); they could no longer use the same technique for 'twisting' the engines (more about that in the build review); I'm not convinced by the brown pieces; and they still hadn't made the thing two seater even though the new cockpit design wouldn't take much persuasion. Though it is a 2007 set it doesn't look all that out of place next to the newer X-Wing (9493) and A-Wing (in 7754). She's stood the test of time well so far!</p><p><br></p><p>So how is she to <b>build</b>? The ship gets satisfyingly large very quickly, and it's not long before the abundance of greebles starts to appear. The cockpit is well constructed and well integrated into the rest of the structure. For such a long ship the fuselage is remarkably stable and rigid. I believe this was the first set to put the astromech droid sideways for space, one of a number of clever building techniques. And the back of the ship is covered in exquisite detailing, with a fair bit of it very cleverly applied, particularly the parts on the sides of the ship.</p><p>The engines and engine struts attach in a modular fashion, though the struts are fixed to the body very securely with yet more greebles - the flag poles that appear to attach to the body between the slope bricks are a particularly good looking touch. The engines themselves are brilliant too, with the main sections being half single-moulded piece, and half grille bricks and slopes adding yet more detailing (it seems ludicrous to me that the 2012 version replaces this with a sticker! How dare they?!), but the real trick is how the circular pieces are aligned to give a 45 degree turn, so the Technic support beams can run down the sides properly.</p><p>The <b>finished model</b> is tremendous, and having painstakingly applied the greebles yourself you can't help but feel proud of how&nbsp;splendidly&nbsp;detailed she is. The parts and colours come together well, and though the proportions aren't spot on they're more than close enough, and I think ships should still feel like Lego versions, which this does. It's easy to pick up and swoosh, although the two features do limit the angles you can swoosh at! There are two of the best flick fire missiles I've ever seen in the engine struts, long Technic rods that have a long 'barrel' so they fly the length of my living room! But they simply sit in, so fall out if you tilt the Y-Wing downwards. And there is a crude bomb bay at the back that will drop the bombs if you tilt upwards, so side to side it is!</p><p>The <b>figures</b> are the one real weak point of the set. The pilot is at least flesh coloured, although he's not given a proper face. And R5-D4 is still suffering from just a band of printing on his dome. That said, the body of the droid is great, and he does look nice in red, and the pilot's helmet is very well printed. And of course, they go very well with the set - if you're really bothered by the shortcomings a quick part change or two isn't too hard with BrickLink either.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>So, so much detailing, and some of it is really clever</li><li>Great size, whilst being surprisingly sturdy</li><li>The ship as a whole looks fantastic, and is very playable</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A couple of&nbsp;tell-tale&nbsp;2007-isms in the figures</li><li>The missiles and bombs are free to fall out</li></ul>
<p><br></p><p>I do love this ship! She looks so good, is engaging and fun to build, with barely any boredom considering how symmetrical she is. I thought she'd be a hard act to follow, and I believe she has proved to be so. The 2012 update may well be better in some technical regards, but the look of the cockpit and the engines is such a step backwards that I wonder why it was done. Once you've got the X-Wing, this has to be the second ship in your Rebel fleet!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"psychman7","2013-06-09T17:44:28.637Z","Star Wars Set #5: 7658 Y-wing Fighter","Along with sets #7655 Clone Troopers Battle Pack, #6205 V-wing Fighter, and #6212 X-wing Fighter, I got this one for Christmas in 2007. It's a very nice looking Y-wing (Although few would argue #9495 Gold Leader's Y-wing Starfighter is better, which is my opinion, but I'll be reviewing that one later.).<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>The box has nice detailing in the background, mercilessly flying over the Death Star and dropping its bombs. The instructions, I must say out of the so-far five I've reviewed, was definitely the most interesting, especially the technique on the engines with the macaroni pieces. They were easy to understand and, like I said, were packed with interesting building styles.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>There were lots and lots of great pieces, including an extensive number of white rods and macaroni pieces. There are also a number of smaller pieces for the greebles on the fuselage. A very good selection.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>Honestly, the lack of minifigures is slightly disappointing, as you only get two (a pilot and an astromech droid). The pilot is pretty good, you get a cool helmet out of it, but that's really all to say about it. There's even less to say about the astromech droid, because it's basically a red R2-D2.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Y-wing:</b></div><div>The lack of somewhat suck-ish minifigures totally gets made up for by this Y-wing. Despite its few flaws, it's very well designed. I definitely love the fuselage the best, because of the number of details it holds. The issue with that part is that the missiles fall out when you tip the ship forward. The bomb-dropping feature is really good, and I like the color choice they used for said bombs. Moving on to the engines, they are spectacularly detailed for a no-sticker set. The textured pieces are used, which only makes it even more awesome. As noted earlier, the technique used to create these engines were very clever. I especially like the cone piece with the giant hole in the middle, because it looks so much better that way. Finally, the cockpit. The absolute worst part of the set. And I criticize the cockpit over everything else because it is so poorly designed. The nose is way too triangular in contrast to the actual thing. This is one of the things that was fixed in #9495, which I will review much later. The cannons are kind of wimpy, but the space in the cockpit is good, so it's not too horrible.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Lots of macaroni pieces, greebles, and rods. Also the clever technique deserves kudos.</div><div>Minifigures - 4/10 - Necessary, of course, but too predictable and repetitive.</div><div>Y-wing - 9/10 - It would have gotten the full monte if it weren't for the stupid cockpit.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 7.67/10. I would have rated it better, but the numbers don't lie, and the minifigures are to blame. The ship gets a good amount of credit.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4
"Lego_Aidan","2014-03-26T15:03:59.64Z","Well worth it, the best Y-Wing Ever","<p>The Y wing 7658 was a 2007 LEGO Star Wars set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box depicts the Y wing bombing the Death Star in the famous trench scene.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some exclusive parts, all in Yellow, grey or white. There are 453 of them so for $50 CAD it&#39;s well worth it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Y wing pilot just has a basic smiley, but the torso print and the helmet never gets old.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself was fun, but it wasn&#39;t complex in any way.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model will go good with any LEGO Star Wars displays.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The features and overall look is cool, and the set is recommended if you can get it for a decent price (Under $60).</p>

<p>So Yes, I&#39;d recommend it to a friend for sure.</p>
