"wyoeaglefan","2006-12-28T11:27:46Z","Great Set!","           This set is a must have for any Star Wars lego collection. The best part about the set is definately the dual firing torpedo luanchers. Mainly becuase there is two not just one. There is a mechanism that drops four bombs out of the rear of the ship that is pretty cool. The main body of the craft detaches from the wing-cockpit assembly to from the dropship portion of the shuttle. The wings are on a twist mechanism that folds them up and down with the turn of a gear. It also comes with 4 stromtroopers! The only thing i think i would change is make the wings a bit sturdier. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TheBigGuy","2007-02-03T16:57:49.083Z","Finally a new set!","With the proliferation of remakes recently from Star Wars Lego its great to get a new original set!  And I would have to say that would be close to one of the all time greats, right up there with Muhammed Ali and Pele(just kidding!)  Seriously, it is the best set released for a long time.  It looks complicated to build but in reality is quite easy and fun.  The detail is superb, although with nothing to really compare with in the movies makes it easier.  The number of minifigures at 5 is good for a set of this size too.  My favourite part has been commented on by other is the dual missle mechanism.  Very cool!  The wings could be a bit sturdier but the twist mechanism (similar to the new X-wing and the ARC-170) makes opening the wings easier.  All in all, one of the true greats fit to adorn any Star Wars Lego Hall of Fame.   10 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bran_don_jin","2007-02-24T16:48:10.45Z","Excellent!","This is a very nice set with a few flaws but they can't ruin the great set. As everybody said the good things about this set are the amount of minifigs(5), the two thats TWO firing missiles and thats its a new set, not a remake. 
The bad things about this set are the wings, they are flimsy and I would prefer to open the wings manually, not like the ARC-170 and X-wing way.It takes WAY too long. I think LEGO keeps on doing this to make the piece count higher to then make the price higher. Last of the bad is it is very cramped in the room where the troops sit. 
These flaws are easily overlooked though and don't let them stop you from buying this great set. 9/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lord_A","2007-02-18T05:31:28.107Z","Very Good Set","A very nice new set. (finally, I'm sick of all the re-releases lately)
Tons of playability in this model as with all new Star Wars Lego sets of late. The dual firing missile's are awesome, and the ability to remove the top half of the Landing Craft is very cool indeed.
I feel the set is a bit let down because of the wings, they should have had some more detail on them and as others have said they aren't that sturdy.
On the plus side you do get a lot of figures (5 in total), again this seems to be the way Lego is heading lately as pretty much most of their new sets are loaded with figures. This is great, you can never have enough figures!
Overall this is a great set and looks great next to set #7166 'Imperial Shuttle' - I'd recommed it to all Classic Star Wars Lego fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Paul007","2007-04-23T09:04:51.74Z","Very good set for the price","This is overall one of the best star wars sets i have ever seen.  The two torpedo launchers both face forward and are attached to a detachable troop cabin.  The one downside to this is that the cabin does not have as much room, but can fit all FOUR stormtroopers very nicely.  Though the wings are thin, they are rather sturdy and fold up with a twist of the back knob.  Though it could have come with a stormtrooper dewback, Imperial landing craft were deployed all over the galaxy, not just on tatooine.
Good things:
Great set for the price
Four stormtroopers
Four new guns
Detachable troop pod
dual torpedo launch tubes
dual bomb chutes
sturdy set
Bad things:
Cramped quarters in the troop cabin.

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-13T09:54:04.857Z","Well designed for a good price","The great characteristic of the Imperial Landing Craft (ILC) is the fact it is aesthetic pleasing. It is very well designed it terms of both physical appearance and functionality. You first build the main section of the ILC adding technic parts for the two main torpedo guns. You sit the two Stormtroopers just behind the guns and the two Sandtroopers in the centre, them siting on two seats each with their own guns sitting vertical in front of them. 

You then have inside the main section is a open level where you have the four bombs. This is a great placement for them because after you finish building the main section, you will then realise the two red parts behind the ILC is a release mechanism to eject the bombs. The bombs do actually come out and fall!

The time-consuming and some what difficult part of building this set is the entire mechanism for the ILC's two side wings. This part of the ILC is made of complete Technic parts. Look at the instructions carefully so that once you have finished, the wheels must turn in order for you to operate the wings' circular movement.

Excellent cockpit, I love the opening and closing of the overhanging compartment doors. It is a beautiful ship with a very nice looking Imperial Pilot.

Word of warning: The two torpedo weapons do actually fire and they will hurt you if you misuse them!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Darth_Shockwave","2007-10-05T07:29:44.217Z","A great troop builder set","For those that can rememeber, the Imperial landing craft had all off 2 seconds of screen time in Star Wars, it can be seen in the background on Tatoinne, dropping Sandtroopers off. It's mostly enjoyed fame in the computer games. But anyway this model is nicely put together and fits in nicely with earlier released Imperial Shuttle. It comes with 5 minifigs, 2 Stromies, 2 Sands and a pilot. The Shuttle is brimming with weapons, it's got 2 rocket launchers, 4 bombs that drop from the back, plus numerous blaster emplacements on the hull. The ship incorporates a detachable centre hull, which the troops sit in, it reminds me off the drop pods from Thunderbird 2, in Thunderbirds. Anyway onto the pro's and con's.

Pro's
More Stormtroopers
More Sandtroopers
Twin rocket launchers
Auto wings
Detachable centre pod

Con's
The wings can be slightly loose

Overall: - I love this set, it has a well built design to it. Plus it's a vehicle that has not been made by Lego till now. I'd highley recommend buying this set, as it's got a good number off troops, and looks nice next to the Imperial shuttle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2008-01-01T15:46:30.92Z","Traitor!","The Imperial drop ship although it was only in the movie for a few seconds this was a welcome addition to my collection. The box is fairly big but strangely the box art depicts the drop ship bombing its own troops (perhaps the pilot is a rebel?). The bags aren't supposed to be numbered but two of mine had 2 printed on them (Packaging error I guess). There are five minifigs one is a black pilot like the one featured in the tie interceptor, he’s pretty much a black storm trooper. There are also two sandtroopers who have a little paper sash its similar to what Lego capes are made of. Accompanying them are two regular stormtroopers they don’t have printed legs. Both the stormtroopers and the sand troopers have new blaster pieces there are two short and 2 big blasters.
The build goes by quickly using a lot of Technic and gears, for the wings you build the crew compartment first then the main body of the craft with wings then the cockpit finally the tail. The crew compartment attaches to the hull by some clip pieces it’s very sturdy and makes the ship swooshable. Inside the crew compartment is the bombing feature and some shooting missiles. The bombing feature is okay as it doesn't take up much room and is very functional there’s a little knob you pull that makes the bombs fall down a chute and out of the ship. Often though the bombs will start moving around the crew compartment and it can be annoying too get them out. 
Another feature is the firing missiles which work okay to use them you push on a small Technic bar which in turn pushes the trigger firing the missile. You don’t need to open the ship to use them. Often however I end up shooting my finger because of the trigger placement. Instead of the missiles which take up a lot of room they could have replaced them with some extra stormtroopers and a small control area or some other ship detail such as a tool rack and engine.
The wings can fold up into landing mode by just turning a dial on the back of the ship, it works thanks to a lot of gears. The feature works well and it doesn’t take long to move the wings. The cockpit is simple and very big in it is a red vent a control panel and some 1 by 1 slopes. It's attached with some clips to the main body of the craft.
Overall Lego did a good job with it the different grays and white on the wings and tail make it look somewhat realistic as it looks like paint has worn off. At 70 dollars it seems a bit too much money for what you get. It’s more like a 55-60 dollar set. The bombs and missiles aren't needed and they don't really help the playability factor since you can't use them while flying the craft. Still it's a good set but not a real troop builder or anything fantastic. 3.5/5

"Leggodt94","2008-05-13T15:45:43.67Z","Very nice, but one MAJOR problem ","When the LEGO company decided to make a set of this very unnoticeable vehicle, I have no idea, but I'm glad that they did! This set features amazing little extras like dropping bombs, spring-loaded missiles, and wings that can be easily opened and closed at the turn of a gear. Also, this set includes a great number of minifigs which include: 2 rare sandtroopers, 2 stormtroopers, and an imperial pilot(trying not to say &quot;tie pilot&quot;); however, when I first got this set back in 2007, it didn't include any of the character pieces. Weird. But, eventually, I was able to get them, and they are great! 

Yes, all these features make this set great, but there is one big problem with this set: THE DETAIL! LEGO made so many errors with the actual look of the model, because this ship can actualy be seen at the end of Revenge of the Sith, and it looks nothing like this set. I mean, the &quot;fin&quot; is supposed to be much shorter, the wings are supposed bent at the top(like the imperial shuttle), and the color is supposed gray not white. Sorry for the complaining, but if this is where LEGO got the idea for the Imperial Landing Craft, they must have not been whereing their glasses when they watched the movie. Well, everything about this set is great except the detail. I would still get it though. It makes a nice, expensive stormtrooper battle pack. :P   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy94","2009-02-01T13:14:18.373Z","Almost perfect set","I bought this set a few days ago on ebay for 50 euros and I must say I spent well my money. Otherwise the official legoshop price is too expensive (65 euros) for a 471-pieces set. Now the review.

BUILDING AND INSTRUCTIONS
The imperial landing craft instructions are quite simple and easy to understand. In my box there was an added sheet of the instructions book, replacing a wrong one ( the imagine tells to add two pieces on the cannons, I don't know why). The building passages aren't so difficult, of course you must pay a lot of attention assembling the technic bricks-made section of the engines. I have to mention only one part that isn't clear: when you build the mobile center (central section) it's difficult to understand how setting the stormtroopers. The building took me about two and half hours.

THE MINIFIGURES
The imperial landing craft comes with five minifigs. Two of them are normal stormtroopers (with new design), one is an imperial pilot and the last two are very rare sandtroopers (basically a stormie with an orange thing on the neck). All the minifigs are very detailed and this set was, in 2007, the unique ""unexpensive"" way to get plenty of stormies.

THE CRAFT
After the construction, when you see the whole ship for the first time, you will be pleased for the size and the design of the craft. Actually it's very big, confronted with other ships but for 65 euros I would expect a lot more. Apart from this, the ILC is very well designed. The clean white colour is perfect as the light\dark grey wings, except for the red bricks on the back that ruin the colr scheme. The blue-design of the engines is very cool, as the dark cockpit. 

THE FEATURES
The ILC has a lot of features:
-the two firing cannons, that are like those of Knights Kingdom, take a lot of space in the large interior, but fire very well and far
-the central part is the detachable command center, where all the stormtroopers can sit, here there are the cannons, the bombs and the guns for the soldiers
-the four bombs are located in two separated sections in the interior, being released by a very intelligent mechanism: you must only use the two red bricks on the back
-the wings, that can fold up with a clever but intricate gear system.
-the cockpit can go up and down
-sides can open

PROS
-great design
-plenty of minifigs
-santroopers
-four guns (two big and two small)
-finally an imperial pilot
-a lot of features
-very sturdy and fun to play with

CONS
-pilot needs a gun
-when you left down the wings, you can't put the craft apart or the wings will break
-the side panels of the ship fall apart easily
-if you incline the ship, the bombs fall off and you must open the interior to find them

"Jim_Java","2008-10-18T14:56:28.293Z","Don't Do A Loop!","This is a great set, but it's got one glaring flaw I'd like to address.  In RETURN OF THE JEDI, and in all other officially licensed media, its wings are located on either side of the craft. On this version, they're located BEHIND it. 
     So, there you have it: The one flaw in an otherwise perfect set.  Seriously, this thing is neat! Obviously, the wings can be moved up and down with the turn of a knob, which is neat.  But there are some other neat things about this set, too.
     First off: The build.  This set has a lot of gears, and it's quite important that they're all in the right place. There were two or three times building this where I screwed up.  But other than that, the set was pretty easy to build, although it could take more than a few minutes.
     Once it's built, there're some things you notice immediately, such as the Stormtroopers' helmets. On the box, they have the old simple black mouth, but in the actual set, they have sweet helmets that look more detailed.  On the mouths, there're grey lines that make the Stormtroopers look a little meaner Two of the Troopers also have cool little orange capes, and there's a black pilot trooper as well. 
     Then there's the element of detachability. Like the Republic Attack Gunships that carried AT-TEs into battle in STAR WARS EPISODE II, you can detach the wings, fin, and cockpit from the troops' section to create: A) a lighter, one-man Landing Craft, and B), a makeshift Stormtrooper Fort!
     Finally,  there's the armaments. We get two sniper rifles, and two rifles.  These aren't loudspeakers or rocket launchers (like on Jabba's Sail Barge, and the Clone Turbo Tank), either.  No, these look like actual rifles. Sweet.  Then, you get two spring loaded darts on either side of the cockpit, which are part red for some strange reason. 
     And then there are the bombs.. sigh... When is LEGO going to get that these don't work that well?  I mean, they drop out fine, and they don't look all that bad, but if you do a loop-de-loop with the craft, or otherwise change its gravitational orientation, they fall out of their holding areas, and onto the floor of the troops' area. Still, that's no big deal if you take the bombs out. But I can imagine how that would go if the ship were designed that way: &quot;Troopers, hold steady, we'll do a barrel roll and avoid those missiles.  Here we go... Made it! Wait, what's that? THE BOMBS FELL OUT?! HOLY MOTHER OF VADER, WE&quot;RE---&quot; BOOM!  
     Overall? It's a great set.  If you want to &quot;build your army,&quot; or you just want a Classic Trilogy Era set in this price range, get this set. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll just do a loop, and then those Rebel Scum will never know what happened!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It also comes with four stormtroopers; 2 regular and 2 sandtroopers, alongside a TIE pilot.

The set also has two firing rockets (not the flick fires but the spring launchers) and 4 bombs to give the craft an open spot to drop off.

"starwarsgeek101_","2010-01-26T12:51:51.433Z","Very nice","The features on this set are countless. 2 stations where you can drop booms, 2 stations where you can shoot missles (not flick), two passenger seats, a deployable base for the stormtroopers and rotatable wings. Not only are the features cool, the minifigs are nice too. You get 4 stormies with this set and a imperial pilot. The build itself is actually not as boring as you would think. It is also not as repetitive. Overall, for $50, it is a nice deal and a really cool army builder.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jcc2224","2010-01-07T08:23:41.547Z","Nice set, very nice set inded!","This set is the best set I've gotten for my Imperial forces! The minifigs are great, along with the wing mechanism. It has a lot of Technic bricks for the wings, but is mainly pins and gears. The interior has room for four and for their guns. You push the gun on the front of the body to shoot the missile. It can drop four bombs, and has two blue seats and to gunner positions. I got this set a few years ago at Wal-Mart for 49.99 USD.

I got this set in 2006 along with the Y-Wing set, and I have to say that this one is the weaker of the two.<br><p>Well, it would be hard to top the Y-Wing, so that's the way the Wookiee rumbles. I do like this vehicle, and I'm eager to get to the review stage!</p><p>First off, the figures are quite cool. We have two stormtrooper commanders with those little pauldrons, two standard stormtroopers, and an Imperial Pilot like in the TIE models. Five in all. That's a tally comparable with the Venator Cruiser, in a set this size! Maybe it was a total lack in the Venator set, which I'm still steamed about. I digress- The landing ship is a joy to build, with a simple structure, some classic parts such as those curved panels I've seen in an old Breezeway Cafe set and some Space Port-era landing struts, and a good amount of space. This one also marked the advent of those rubbery Technic-style parts, which I found unusual but cool. Loaded into the ship's fuselage are a pair of missile launchers, which I love. The triggering mechanism is inspired- I won't spoil how it works! In the rear of the ship are seats for the Imperial schills, lockers for weapons and two cute little bomb dispenser chutes that operate with those rubbery parts. LEGO can't be accused of being unimaginative. The wings are a superb mechanism, and the dorsal hydroplane on top tops it off none too symbolically.<br></p><p>The problems I have with this set are mostly down to detail inside the craft. The cockpit is well done, with a cool panel and bright lights. But the rear compartment is featureless. A few panels or something would have helped. Also, the bombs have a nasty habit of jumping out of the ship if held in certain positions. Fianlly, the wings are uneven if the cogs come loose and reattach in the wrong positions. But that's down to me.</p><p>All in all, a good craft, but it's more for the hardcore enthusiasts rather than casual fans, as it has little role in the films and more in underlying fiction. <br></p><p>-maaboo35<br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3

"legoreviewer266","2011-11-23T17:30:13.723Z","Great Army Builder!","<b>Build:</b> The build was fun. It wasn't&nbsp;complicated or complex. It had decent amount of steps and didn't take very long. Probably the funnest part to build would have to be the engine/ gears. Not only it was cool to see how the mechanism worked and it turned out pretty smooth and workable. There were no stickers in this set at all and only 1 printed piece, which was a control panel. The build only took me approximately 1.45 min, which wasn't too bad for a set with nearly 500 pieces. The set it very sturdy except for when you're building the engine. The engine tends to fall off when you put the rod in it and you've just got to balance it.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><b>Mini figures:</b> There is nothing too special about the minifigures. You get 2x Storm Troopers, 2x Sand Troopers and a Storm Trooper Pilot. None of the figures listed are exclusive, which is kind of lame. However, it's great if you want to build armies. I know there is also set 7667, but if you want a set with good playability and lots of mini figures, then you've thought of the right set. The Sand Troopers are not too spectacular, except for their shoulder pads. Their shoulder pads <b><i>HAVE</i></b> been used in a few other sets like 4501 and 7261.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Set:</b> The set is what makes up for everything. You got great amount of playability, such as the wing play feature, which basically if you turn on a rod, you can unfold the wings. The thing that I really enjoyed over all the other shuttle, is that wing is not just on a hinge, like 7166, 8019 or even 8096. it's on a gearing system, which is just superb. There is also 2 missiles located in the front of the set, either side of the cockpit. To deploy the missile, there are 2 green cones that stick out on either side. All you have to do, is press the button and the missiles will shoot out. The mechanism actually works great and the both the missiles are spring loaded, so they shoot about 1-2 metre away, depending on what angle you hold them. The way the bomb mechanism works, the bombs sit on a little shelf and to drop them you've got to push up on a red tab, which again is located on either side of the set. The bombs will drop out in 2's and once they have dropped out you get a total of 4 bombs. To access the inside, you've got to open all the 3 white panels located on either side. It's kind of hard to reach the inside, but there is also another feature included! If you unpin 2 rods that clip into the front and back, you'll be able to detach the whole set, which is pretty sick and this way you get way better play space and play value. There are also 2 landing gears included in the both front and back, but they are <b><i>NOT</i></b> retractable. The front cockpit is also very nice... only seat for 1 mini figure though, but there is also some controls inside and the ""neck"" itself is on a hinge and it moves up and down.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion:</b> This set is excellent. If you can get your hands on this set, I highly recommend it, it's absolutely fantastic and great amount of play features included. Great for army building and the playability alone makes the price tag of ""$50US"" dollars worth it.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pros:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>- great amount of playability</div><div><br></div><div>- lots of Storm Troopers, great for building armies</div><div><br></div><div>- well worth the original price</div><div><br></div><div>- the bombs and the missile features both work exceptionally well</div><div><br></div><div>- very stable and well balanced</div><div>- no stickers!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cons:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>- the wings get&nbsp;clogged up if you turn the knob too much, so you have to rebuild that&nbsp;section</div><div><br></div><div>- do <b><i>NOT</i></b> use the&nbsp;central wing (mast) as a handle lol</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"Chills","2012-04-19T13:38:31.11Z","A very cool set from the expanded universe","I got this gem of a set on ebay from an adult collector, and it was in perfect order. All the pieces where there, clean, and in great condition (along with the box and instructions). I also got a great deal on it, as not many people were bidding. This set wasn't high on my ""want"" list but, like the Emperor's Shuttle, it was a lot of fun to build and packed with features.<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: This set was never featured in the movies, but it showed up in numerous video games. That being said, there isn't a lot of canon for the designers to follow, but still the set looks great and has the Star Wars feel. <br></li><li>Pro 2: This set has a TON of little features that make it lots of fun. Wings that rotate simultaneously, dual missiles, bombs, and spots for all of the minifigures.</li><li>Pro 3: 5 minifigures are included with the set, which is great for building your&nbsp; Imperial army. The figures are standard, and the sand troopers have the old style shoulder pauldrons.</li><li>Pro 4: The set is quite solid. Not like the TIEs that can fall apart due to weak joints, this set is quite sturdy. But like another reviewer has mentioned, do not use the vertical fin as a handle.</li><li>Pro 5: The build was pretty cool. Lego even had a technique I'd not seen before: when building the tecnic parts you use some pieces twice, the first time to align the gears and then again for attaching more parts. Quite creative.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The landing craft is really really white. It would be cool if some of the pieces had some ""battle damage."" The ship looks too clean.<br></li></ul>
<p>This is a really cool set, it's packed with little features and has a good amount of playability. You also can't argue with 5 minifigures. For those of you who want to have a little something different in your collections this is a great set. The build was fun, and I liked how creative the designers got with it. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"mr_skinny","2012-06-02T17:51:47.26Z","So many people seem to miss where this vehicle appears in the movies...","This vehicle may well have started life in the Star Wars 'expanded universe' but like many more vehicles such as the swoop bike, George Lucas decided to add them in when the Special Editions of the original trilogy were produced. The imperial landing craft can be seen for approximately 2 seconds (blink and you'll miss it!) in Star Wars Episode IV when sandtroopers are deployed on Tatooine to recover the escape pod that helped Artoo and Threepio escape. Whilst it's screen presence was minimal, it at least gave an insight as to how the sandtroopers got from a Star Destroyer naval vessel to the surface of Tatooine - now where did the Dewbacks come from?! Given the very brief cameo appearance, I think LEGO did a cracking job with the design. With regards playability my children are much more impressed with the spring loaded missiles on this set compared to rather feeble 'flick fire' missiles featured on most new LEGO Star Wars sets.",FALSE,4,4,3,5,4
"psychman7","2013-07-03T18:51:35.25Z","Star Wars Set #8: 7659 Imperial Landing Craft","This only got a few seconds of screen time, and some may consider it an expanded universe vehicle, but it is a true Episode IV vehicle to me. It also is a cool craft that deserves more credit.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>It's a decently large box showing the drop-off of the Imperial troops on Tatooine. For some reason a battle's going on, and that never happened as far as I know.... Anyway, the instructions included an extra loose page, showing the correct way to build the firing mechanism. Well, at least mine did.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>At the time, I've never seen so many gears in one set. There were lots and lots of gears! But apart from the gears, other interesting pieces included the windscreen, the projectile launchers, the projectiles themselves, and the pieces used to cover the hull of the craft.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>All five of them can fit inside the craft: The TIE pilot can be placed in the cockpit (why a TIE pilot was used in the first place, I have no idea), and the stormtroopers and sandtroopers can be placed in the hull section. All of them are very cool, especially the sandtroopers with their pauldrons.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Landing Craft:</b></div><div>It's a very nice craft, I absolutely love it. Beginning with the troop compartment, the projectile missiles used are very nice and fun to play with, especially if you have two. The stormtroopers can put their weapons aside while they're either riding or controlling the guns. The bomb-dropping feature is really cool. You have to pull the tabs at the back to release the bombs. The only thing I don't like is the stupid landing gear. Next we come to the wings. The fact that the wings fold up and down is just awesome, just like the real thing. The gear system is amazing. The top fin, which technically qualifies as a wing, is very technicolor. I don't really like this all that much, because it doesn't quite look accurate to the film version. Finally, we have the cockpit. You can remove the canopy to place the pilot. It's a very nice, roomy cockpit with extra guns at the front of the craft.
