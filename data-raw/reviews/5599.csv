"iceinatorKoPaKa","2007-09-06T12:29:27.223Z","Sweet!","I absolutely LOVE this game. It's really awesome. I've beaten it, but I still like to play it. It's also cool how you can make your own person and download characers from the original game.

Pros:
Character Customizing
Ability to be built minikits in bonus levels
Lego City bonus level
Many playable characters
Cool levels

Cons:
Very few human pieces for character customizing
The Starfighter levels are pretty hard

9.5 of 10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T10:25:36.967Z","Fun for the whole family!","This game is well improved from the first lego star wars game. It is a little harder to complete but you have many more features and new characters! The cantina is very nice too, with very random characters inside it that can start fights with you. So far I am only 95% complete with it but the game is supposed to be hard!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"comandercody654","2008-11-25T10:19:47.7Z","Better than #1","I got this game the day it came out and it was very addicting trying to get all the gold bricks.
 pros:customizable characters
          you can ride vehicles
          The puzzles are VERY easy 
           If you have the old game you unlock all those characters from that game
  Cons:Once you beat the game it is no more fun
 I personally think this is a improvement over #1   That is my review

"JSB23","2008-12-30T12:26:31.653Z"," it's a sequal ","This is a pretty good game, no game overs so not too hard but the levels are really long (like 30+ minutes each for most of them) on to the pros and cons

Pros 
Easy 
Not that much ""real"" violence 
With so much stuff to unlock this is easily a 20+ hour game
Lego city >:)
Drop in drop out co-op

Cons
No mid-level saves 
Some of the levels are really long/hard

Closing notes
This is a great game, a ton of secrets and plenty of difficult things to find (Mini kits) this game has lasting appeal  

4/5
