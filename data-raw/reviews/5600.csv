I opened up the metal clasps (high quality and strong) and removed the trays inside. The trays were compartmentalized which is a plus. The LEGO artwork on the sides of the case are beautiful depictions of minifigs and the color is attractive,  the case screams LEGO. Unfortunately, the quality screams Best Lock (a LEGO knock off)! I attempted to put the trays back in the box and they had trouble fitting in as the top would not close. I applied the tiniest bit of pressure and the sides of the case began to tear. The yellow paper and cardboard in the corner of the box split. This was WITHOUT any LEGO inside! I opened the box, removed the trays, put the trays back in the box and attempted to close the box and the thing split! I returned it to a LEGO store 2 days after Christmas for store credit so in the end this was a useful gift. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
