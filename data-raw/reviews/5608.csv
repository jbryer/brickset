"Johan_van_den_Heuvel","2007-05-25T15:28:55.307Z","Combining and improving 7141 and 7111","I just picked it up at my local toy store for about 34 EURO, 46 USD.
Although i expect it will be cheaper in the US, since everything is cheaper over there. Lego exchange rates still puzzle me.
Sitting on my desk it looks amazing! Personally i think its a big, big improvement from set 7141. 
Next to the Naboo Fighter, the Vulture Droid is realy a big improvement from 7111.
Now to the pros and cons list:

pros:
-It's Star Wars
-R2D2
-Rocket launcher
-nice slick design!!
-mostly build from current standard bricks!! BIG PLUS
-Swooshable
-Anakin Skywalker boy
-Naboo Fighter pilot!! 
-Really, really good Vulture Droid!!
-Nice wing folding design of the Vulture Droid

Cons (after a lot of thought :P):

-rocket fires a bit too easily
-Maybe a bit expensive (in Europe) if you're not a real Star Wars fan

overall:

Really nice set! The Vulture Droid is fantastic. A must have for every Star Wars fan and lego enthousiast. Really slick, nice, long design of the Naboo Fighter. 
Even if you're not really into Star Wars i would advice this set, because it has nice playability for children and simply looks great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

- Nice sleek design
- pilot mini-fig

Cons:
- stickers, i hate stickers
- don't really care about vulture droid

"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-09-04T02:00:27.037Z","Not perfect, but still worth getting","I've just finished building this set yesterday and it is indeed rather marvellous, if not a tad junour-ised on the surface. Here goes: 

I've always wanted to own a version of the Naboo N-1, and neither the original nor the UCS version really tickled my fancy. Thankfully though, Lego has come up with this, which is a really nice rendition. However, there are a few glaring flaws, though those can easily be fixed with a little MOC-ing. 

First off as usual, the minifigures. The set features lovely new figs in the form of an adorable Anakin and a Naboo fighter pilot. I would have liked the addition of a battle droid or two, just as in the original. The extra little hat for the pilot is a great touch, and the hairpiece for Anakin is one of the more realistic ones Lego has done. 

My dad and brother scoffed at the Naboo N-1 for being to juniour-ised in design. While it definitely is a bit simple, I was quite fine with the lovely sleek design. I was sorely disappointed about the lack of nicely chromed parts, which are one of the fine features of the fighter. Also, the missile launcher is in a terrible position, and gets set off far too easily. The cockpit is non-hinging, which can be easily fixed, but shows a slight lack of effort on that front. 

Thankfully though, the detail is lovely. It is a pity that these are once again achieved with (arrgh) stickers. I didn't quite like the ladder, and thought that it was a little weird. The missile launcher, as mentioned in many previous reviews, almost always sets itself off. As such, I removed the missile launcher altogether and stripped the ladder down. The harpoon gun is lovely, but I can't seem to figure out why it's there. 

The Vulture droid is definitely times better than its two predecessors. I was surprised they hadn't used this design earlier on. However, the push-fire missiles are really getting on my nerves. So are the stickers. Anyway though, it is a rather nifty lil design. 

My biggest gripe is with the obscene pricing. I was expecting this set to be the same price as Anakin's starfighter and the Vulture droid. However, it comes at a crazy Singapore $71.90

"lostcarpark","2007-08-18T21:01:35.457Z","Swooshable!","As with the other reissues, this is a vast improvement on the original. Much sleeker, and captures the curves of the Naboo fighter much better. I particularly like the bottom-loading R2 compartment, though he is rotated 90 degrees so he's sideways. I think the back is a little too big, because of the R2 compartment, but it's not a big deal. I also think it's a pity you have to lift off the windscreen to let the pilot in or out. I would have liked to see a sliding cockpit like the one of General Grevious' ship.

A nice touch is the stand for the ship, but it supports it by the missile launcher, so you have to be careful not to fire while attaching or detaching. Nice use of a balcony railing for a ladder.

The vulture droid is also much better than the original droid starfighter. It's held together by droid arms, which seems a little flimsy at first, but gives it nice fluid movements.

While this set may seem a little pricey, there's a lot in the box, and the new new fighter is quite substantial. It has two great minifigs, a Naboo pilot and a short-legged Anikan, complete with pouty face.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"omgbrick","2007-11-30T01:40:48.86Z","Bad Missle Placement","For forty dollars this set seems slighty overpriced. Anyways the minifigs are great Aniakin looks good though I'm not a big fan of his hairpiece. THe Naboo pilot just hits the mark the torso looks right like it did in the movie and would also work for a WW2 pilot. He also comes with a bonus cap.

The vulture droid looks good and features a new darker tan on the &quot;torso&quot; of the fighter. The wings stay in postion secularly wile in flight. The fighters only fault is the flick fire missles which alaways fall out.

The N-1 itself looks very authentic and is large. However the antena on it areprone to breaking and will fall off. The interior of the cockpit is okay but contains only a black printed plate for controls. altough the model is very swooshable and fairly durable my biggest gripe is the missle shooter placement as the trigger is on the very bottom so alot of times you'll set it off when its in flight or when it lands or takes off. Also R2-D2's little drop out function doesn't really work as the droid is held in to tightly by friction. I like the ingenious use of the railing as a latter.

"david001","2007-09-30T09:57:04.077Z","Naboo fighter done justice","I missed the first release of the Naboo N-1 starfgighter when it was originally released back in 1999; comparing that older model to this new one I'm almost glad that I did!

Looking at pictures here on Brickset, the old model seems too short and fat; this model rectifys that problem with a better width/length proportion.  Like the TIE bomber, and unlike the previous version, this model also includes a proper firing mechanism for its missiles located underneath the main body.  The set comes complete with a mini-display stand (that holds the ladders): a big plus in my book.

You are also provided with a generic Naboo pilot and a young Anakin Skywalker model (although, like the young Boba Fett in the Slave 1 release 7153, the body is out of proportion to the legs) and (another) new design of the Vulture droid.  This Vulture Droid is definately the secondary model of this set: not as much detail has gone into the design of it as has gone into the design of the Naboo starfighter.  While Kudos go to LEGO for (finally) have the head permanently attached to the body that you can raise and turn (instead of the take-off-and-replace method used in other iterations), I have to say that I'm not so keen on how the wings are attached:  the 'arms' holding them together are a bit flimsy and liable to fall off.

In short: liked the main model; not so keen on the secondary.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The rockets block and jam the wings, it's not very sturdy, and it doesn't fold up very well. Next, the naboo starfighter, it wasn't designed very well either. The point at the top sticks out way to much, the drop system is to slow, and the landing pad is waaay too small. However, it did have some good things.

"millacol88","2008-02-01T10:31:44.233Z","Good model, bad instructions","I picked this up on sale for 30$ canadian (regular 40). The build started easy enough until I began to assemble the long, tapering tail of the naboo fighter. Firstly, when building the part on the naboo fighter that will connect to the tail, it tells you to put a blue tecnic connector in a hole at the back. Simple enough, right? Wrong. In the next picture, and all subsequent ones, this piece is gone, leaving you to wonder whether it should be there or not. I decided to leave it there for the time being. When connecting the tail to the main body, it tells you to put a long, red pole into the tail and then connect it to the body. However, this would make the tail stick out too much from the model. After messing around around with that for a while, I realised that disappearing blue piece should be connected to the back of the main body and connected to the tail. In order for it all to work, the long red piece must be removed entirely. I suspect this is not a design flaw,and that it was simply caused by a few errors in the instructions. Other than that, this set is great, boasting a sleek, curvy design faithful to the movies,greatminifigs, and a spring-powered missile that actually goes a fair distance. The vulture droid looks good but it is hard to position the wings. Thereis,however,one other problem, the display stand holds the fighter up by the same peg that controls the missile, so its easy to accidentally fire it while placing it in the display stand. I took apart the display stand from the b-wing set and made this one much sturdier and eliminated thae problem of accidentally setting off the missile.

Pros:
-sleek
-fairhful to movies
-missile works well 
-good figs

Cons:
-errors in instruction manual
-display stand does not work well
-vulture droid is hard to position

Bad news-  The stand for the starfighter- well, lets face it, it  doesnt work! Every time I try to set it on it just falls to the front and rather than a sliding cockpit roof as seen in General Grevious`s starship you get a roof which has to come of to put the figures inside!

The Starfighter is really cool, the big engines and cool detail make it look amazing. I also really like the ramp that allows R2-D2 to fall. It doesn't really work though. The cockpit isn't very roomy but I guess it doesn't have to be. I would be really cool if the cockpit slid forward like on the General Grievous Starfighter. This set also has stickers so that counts as a con. The stand looks pretty cool as well, although mine did get lost and if you pull the ship back the missile flies out. The mini figures are really cool, the detail on the Naboo pilot is really groovy and the young Anakin is cool as well. This ship is actually pretty rubbish because the long yellow poles pointing out the back of each engine makes it even harder to store on a table or in a cupboard. It would be better if R2-D2 was a little bit higher in his seat in the back.

The Vulture Droid is really cool. The head moves which is awesome because the older Vulture Droids didn't move their heads, and the brown panels (wings?) move up and down but they are quite hard the get into a good position. The missiles are pretty annoying because they fall out if you tilt the droid forward, I replaced them with the pieces on the back of the missiles on the Republic Attack Gunship. The stickers are always a con, the stickers on the brown panels are hard to place and you have to be so careful while placing the sticker on the head. The last pro on the Vulture Droid is that it can stand up a lot more easily then the Vulture Droid in the Anakins Jedi Starfighter set. I'm not sure why they made this Vulture Droid brown though, I was slightly confused.

Be sure to read my other reviews.

"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-05-13T12:00:46.327Z","Great complete set!","I just picked this one up in the local store for a discount price. I already had the previous Naboo Starfighter but the moment I saw this one I knew I wanted it. 

It looks so more authentic to the movie, it has a nice stand and of course a complete Vulture Droid and all for around 30 euro's. What more can one want? Well, let's see...

The build was very easy, some steps are broken down in even more steps for a younger audience. The build quality is good as well, but one of the red rods didn't fit that good in the motor gondola and I used that for the tail section. And that is working out fine. 

To use a curved fence for the ladder is a nice find! I never noticed on first sight. 

The Vulture Droid is my first and it needs some getting used to, to put it in the desired position. But a nice addition nevertheless. 

The amount of stickers are a definitive con, I even got a faulty sticker sheet because it wasn't printed on a transparent background but on a white one. The replacement is on its way. 

I love the young Anakin minifig with it's small legs. It's my first child minifig and it's awesome! The Naboo pilot is a big plus. 

Overall I give it a 5, minus 1 for the stickers = 4. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"PepperPizzaMan2585","2009-11-03T20:54:48.53Z","One of the best of it's kind so far.","This is the third naboo starfighter they released, and I must say it's one of the best they released so far. And the droid starfighter is the best they released. They both have alot of resemblance to the movie. Here are my pros and cons.

Pros:
R2-D2
Naboo Starfighter Pilot
Naboo Starfighter
Droid Starfighter
Missle
Ladder

Cons:
Anakin is too short
I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but the missile accidentally shoots out a lot of times when I try to put it on the ladder.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Chills","2012-12-20T08:30:50.647Z","An ok set, but not great.","<p>I recently picked this up from a collector on ebay for a very low price, so I was pretty excited to see what my money bought. This is my first version of the N-1 and I decided on this particular set because it got decent reviews and came with a Vulture droid. Overall, I'm satisfied with this set, however it is quite basic, not very detailed, and there can definitely be improvements made.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: First off I have to say the build was pretty fun for a set with under 300 pieces. You also get some decent parts, like the cylinders used for the engines and the wedges used for the droid's wings.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The minifigures are also pretty cool. The Anakin and pilot are found only in this set and a magnet set, so that makes them unique and a good addition to your collection. This version of R2 appears in 14 sets! But he's necessary for flying the N-1.<br></li><li>Pro 3: There's decent playability with the set. There's a poke-your-eye-out missile on the bottom of the N-1, a trap-door for R2, and a stand for the ship with ladder; but the droid has the most moving parts, with wings, body, and head that move like the movie.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: With only 280 parts there's going to be a lack of detail, and this set has it. The N-1's wings are 1 plate thick, nothing more. The canopy isn't hinged. The tail doesn't flow smoothly from the fuselage, it looks incomplete and unfinished.<br></li><li>Con 2: The ship sits awkwardly on the stand. It balances on the firing pin for the missile launcher, so the ship doesn't sit level. I would have liked to have had landing gear.<br></li><li>Con 3: The droids legs/wings are awkwardly attached with minifigure robot arms. They pop off easily and don't hold well when moving the legs around.</li><li>Con 4: The flick missiles on the droid are just horrible. They aren't even the type that pops into the holder, they just slide in and out. So anytime you move the droid or try to reposition the wings they fall out or get in the way. Horribly designed, LEGO.</li><li>Con 5: The instruction booklet has quite a few misprints. I've never seen such sloppy work from LEGO. It has the incorrect listing for the number of a certain piece; in a couple of steps it showed pieces in the little window that didn't exist in the set, and it never showed where to put the stickers on (one step they weren't on, the next they were).<br></li></ul>
<p>I don't give out many 2 brick ratings, but this set didn't live up to my expectations. Due to the lack of detail and the poor design on so many areas I couldn't give it a 3 even though it has cool parts and was a fun build. I got this for 1/3 of RRP so I can't be too hard on the set; but if you're in the market for an N-1 I would pass on this version and maybe check out the newest one.</p>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,4
"psychman7","2013-06-16T14:59:36.087Z","Star Wars Set #6: 7660 Naboo N-1 Starfighter with Vulture Droid","Two opposing starfighters from the same movie in one set? Those are always good sets. Here is a prime example of one of those. Two awesome vehicles fighting over the droid control ship has officially been boxed together. Let's see what I think!<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b><br>A fairly medium-sized box, with the vulture droid chasing the Naboo fighter. I feel like this should be the other way around. The instructions reveal an extra piece to the puzzle that I'll get to later, so I guess sometimes the instructions are full of surprises!</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Stickers:</b><br>This is the first review I've actually done the stickers on, and although some would say it would go with the box/instructions, I feel as if they should stand out on their own, since they actually stick onto the set. If I'm correct, there should be seventeen. Five of them are used on the vulture droid, and the rest on the Naboo fighter. Seventeen may sound like a lot to some, but for two vehicles, I call it acceptable.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>The pieces here are good choices, especially the antenna pieces mounted on the rear of the Naboo ship. The missile pieces are always fun, especially since playability is increased.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>There are three included here, all of them posing as the good guys. The Naboo pilot isn't bad, but the tan-and-brown color scheme isn't accurate to the red jumpsuit that's in the film. He could, however, also pose as a security guard, which is why the hat was included. The Anakin Skywalker that's included is a remake, and a good one. The helmet that's included can be put on him or the Naboo fighter guy, and Anakin also can use dark-tan-Harry-Potter-hair. As for R2-D2...well, it's R2. You can't get much farther than that.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Naboo N-1 Starfighter:</b><br>Much improved from the first minifig-version. The engines look good, and the overall design is good. Just one thing irks me: The light stone gray should be SHINY. The Naboo fighter is shiny and yellow! I mean, the UCS version clearly saw this, because it's UCS, but they should really start doing that in regular sets too. There is a projectile missile underneath that I noted earlier, and all you do is pull back a short lever and the missile flies out. There's good distance, too. The cockpit introduces another major letdown: the canopy doesn't slide forward. In the movies, it slides forward. Here, you just lift it of to put a pilot in. It would work well for a stop-motion, though. Also, the cockpit has very little room inside it. The minifigure has to stretch his arms up quite a ways to access the controls. R2-D2's spot is sort of a fail in some ways. First, if the ship does a barrel roll, the droid just slips out. The door on the bottom serves as an ejection mechanism, but it could be how he gets into the ship, as the droid enters through the bottom. Next isn't a feature, but sort of something I feel is worth pointing out: The gap with a red thing between the ship and the tail just doesn't seem right if you build it according to the instructions. I fixed this by putting the stopper of the bar before the little yellow cone. The piece is then somewhat invisible. As for the engines, they're pretty good. I wish they would've had the blue light thing, but not everything can be done. Leaving it at that, it's a pretty nice and sleek-looking ship.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Stand:</b><br>With the rod sticking out of the bottom, the ship doesn't stand up properly. But if you slip the rod into a hole in the stand, it stays even just fine. You can move the ship back and forth (I always found this to be fun), and shoot the missile from one spot. The nicely-curved ladder moves and allows Anakin or the pilot to climb into the cockpit.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Vulture Droid:</b><br>It's definitely a step up from the previous version. The head pivots up-and-down properly using black battle droid arms, and it even rotates, which gives it a droid-like quality about it. The leg joints connecting to the main body pivot so it can go into ""walking mode"". It's a perfect version. But the flick missiles are awful. If you tilt the droid downward, the missiles fall out, and I'm not sure the droid itself was planning on this. But that's the only con. Everything else is spot-on.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Note: Multiple numbered bags or ships are always more fun to review, because the final countdown is more accurate.</div><div><br></div><div>Stickers - 8/10 - Definitely add pizzazz to the ship, but 17 is a lot.</div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Good use of pieces, especially the antennas and missile.</div><div>Minifigures - 8/10 - Predictable, but are still good.</div><div>Naboo Starfighter - 8/10 - Points off for the cockpit, tail, and R2's spot.</div><div>Stand - 10/10 - A neat addition, and easy to display and shoot enemy targets from a stationery standpoint.</div><div>Vulture Droid - 9/10 - The missiles docked a point.</div><div><br></div><div>Final result - 8.83/10 - An overall great set that just needs to be tweaked a bit.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
