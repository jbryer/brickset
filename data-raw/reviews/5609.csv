"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-10T12:37:41.513Z","Good but is it right?","I like this set, I like the colour scheme and the way technic is incorporated, I also like the star fighter and especially love the Kit Fisto minifigure. But is it necessary? Do we need it? I don't see the point, with out doubt it’s a great piece of Lego but there is so much more that could have been created in its place!

E.G:

Section of Mygeeto Bridge - Ki adi mundi clones and droids

Simple sets - Yoda vs. The Emperor
                    Emperor vs. Mace Windu

If any Star fighter then Plo Koon in his delta 7, Lego could have easily introduced the set with a small docking bay and a few droids!

And even with these sets no existent the set has more to be desired! I fully realise this is a space set but maybe a ground dock for Kit Fisto with a few engineers and a fighter in pieces? 

I say all this in true, but I do stand at this isn’t a bad set.

"_add_um","2007-09-18T17:24:52.98Z","Great but...","This is a nice set comes with Kit Fisto (a first) another Obi-Wan (this time with a tan colour legs). Most of the set is actualy technic pieces and has a lot of rare blue pieces too. The ship is slightly different than we last saw it (7283 and 7256), the mainly the bottom of the ship is different (because it has to fit into the ring) and it has stickers too. The side guns (which was a hose piece) on the ship have been replaced with a black bar aswell. The ring is pretty nice, it has flick-firing missiles (which I don't really like). Here's the pros and cons.

Pros:
*Kit Fisto
*Another Jedi ship to add to the family
*nice colours
*bronze astro droid

Cons:
*Too expencive
*no lightsaber for Obi-Wan
*stickers

Now for the problems.  The first one is easily fixable, the position that the fighter sits in within the ring is too high, but this can be fixed by flipping the ring upside down to place the fighter in the center of the ring.  The other problem i found is the extra minifig (who's name escapes me at the moment) has nothing to do, he's just a loose minifig thrown in.  It would have been nice to have had a place for him, but oh well, he is an awesome minifig with that rubber head.

When i first saw this set on the websiteI thought to my self &quot;I like Jedi Starfighter but do i really have room for the Booster ring in my room&quot; Anyway i brought it and i was quite suprised it can stand up and that saved alot of space. The Kit Fisto figure is a real plus to the set and the rubber head really hepls it fit inside the Starfighter. This set was very repeditive with it's building, the rings, the boosters etc.
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a low for the set, we all have him but if your friend unexcpectally gives you a rebel pilot when you already have two you can use his head for it (it looks really good because of the head piece.

The ring is what puts people off. Evan I was convinced it was terrrible at the prise and the ring. But the ring's worth it.

Or, you can make the set better, in a scary sceane, for exsample what I did with this and my landing craft: two sand troops climb up the ring, only to find kit fisto on top ready to duel. then a ship shoots the ring, and it topples over. but anyways, good set, better than you think",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"MayTheBricksBeWithYou","2009-05-16T09:28:06.373Z","It's huge but not great build for kids","First I decided not to buy this one because of several negative reviews I read here. But I just picked this one up with a whopping 40 euros discount. Only because the box was a bit damaged. But everything inside was in tiptop condition. And for that price I thought, to hell with all the reviews, let's make up my own mind!

The build was quite boring, especially the Booster Ring, so I imagine that the parent is building while the kid is out playing with the finished Starfighter. But since I do not have kids I had all the fun myself. I loved the ring construction (even though it was boring), it gave me several ideas of other constructions in the future. But that a side; 

It's a huge set and offers great playability. I haven't swhooshed it trough the room yet. But when you hold it tight it's feel good. 

There are some spare parts but they came in pairs so I fitted them on somewhere. The Kit Fisto minifig is a very nice bonus, but there is only room for 1 in the fighter, so.. what about that. 

PROS
+ The size
+ A lot of parts
+ Nice looking Starfighter (altough the back feels a bit empty)
+ Kit Fisto (of course!)

"psychman7","2013-08-29T20:09:48.17Z","Star Wars Set #12: 7661 Jedi Starfighter with Hyperdrive Booster Ring","I got this set for my birthday along with the Rogue Shadow set. This is the second edition of the Jedi interceptor ever made, and the only hyperdrive booster ring. It's great, but with few flaws.<div><br></div><div><b>Box/Instructions:</b></div><div>It's a large box, and it's battling nicely over Mustafar as the starfighter is detaching from the ring. The instructions are clear to read, but it shows how repetitive the build is when constructing the ring.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Stickers:</b></div><div>This set contains ten stickers (four on the wing flaps, two on the cockpit, and two on each of the wings, all on the fighter). None of them were applied to the hyperdrive ring. Ten stickers for a small fighter like this does seem a little much, I must say, but some of them, like the ones on the wing flaps, are necessary.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Pieces:</b></div><div>There's a good piece selection here, I especially like the choices used for the engines on the ring. All the dark blue pieces are nice, and look nice mixed with white and gray.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Minifigures:</b></div><div>Two great figures are included here. The first one is Kit Fisto, one of three I own. He does looks the same as he's always been, but he is an excellent figure! His head detailing is fantastic, and the sand green and brown look great with the big black eyes. He comes with a green lightsaber with that horrible neon yellow green color. Obi-Wan is also included, as the set mostly pretains to him. This is one of the few times he doesn't come with a lightsaber, but I like the figure. He has a headset since he's flying the starfighter mostly. All in all, two very nice minifigs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Jedi Starfighter:</b></div><div>Technically, it's a Jedi interceptor, but it's still a starfighter in some way. It's a major improvement over the first version, which came in two color schemes. It's not quite as good as the 2012 version, and I'm sure the 2014 version will be better, but it's good. The S-foils fold and unfold into flight and attack mode. The wings have excellent detailing with all those vents. The cockpit of the ship opens up to seat a minifigure, and it's a roomy space in there for Obi-Wan. I've put Kit Fisto in there a few times because for the longest time, I thought it was his fighter. Now I realize, after reading other reviews of the set, that it's actually Aayla Secura's. Moving on from that, the landing gear works pretty well, and is best not used when it's attached to the ring. It has two small technic rods that jut out from the bottom that help it attach to the ring. It fits snugly in there. The one con I have about the ship is that the droid doesn't include a body for it. That's a problem that Jedi interceptors have had until 2012 when that problem is solved.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Hyperdrive Booster Ring:</b></div><div>It's a little more of a disappointment than one would expect, mostly because of the stupid flick-fire missiles. These things don't have weapons, Lego! Leave the shooting to the starfighters! Other than that, though, it's a pretty cool looking thing, to be honest. The engines look amazing, which is why I like it so much. The section of where the starfighter locks into place is well-designed, and it works well when blasting into hyperspace.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Final Verdict:</b></div><div>Stickers - 8/10 - A lot for a small ship like that, but it looks good in the end.</div><div>Pieces - 10/10 - Those engines.

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-22T13:31:27.41Z","A pleasant surprise this was made","<p>Some LEGO sets are meant as companions to other sets. This is one such set. 7661 is meant as a companion to 7656 &quot;General Grievous Starfighter&quot;, released the same year. It depicts the blue Eta-2 Actis-class starfighter Obi-Wan took to Utapau and the hyperdrive ring that facilitated the journey. There&#39;s also a bonus Kit Fisto minifig.</p>

<p>The fighter itself is very similar to the first model from &quot;Jedi Starfighter and Vulture Droid&quot; back in 2005. There are, however, some changes. The underside of the cockpit only has one 2x3 inverted slope, to make room for the pieces that hold the ship in the ring. Rather than use a friction hinge brick, the canopy is hinged via a combination of Technic pieces, which unfortunately results in a very loose hinge that A. won&#39;t let the cockpit stay open unless it&#39;s thrown all the way back (something I used to complain about but nowadays I don&#39;t mind) and B. won&#39;t keep the cockpit closed if the 4x4 concave dish with the forward viewport printing is loose or too far out (something actually worth complaining about). The change to the small repeating lasers on the sides of the fighter is welcome, however. The use of 1x1 plate-with-grip pieces to hold black narrow rods is sturdier than the original design&#39;s use of minifigure neck brackets to hold fuel nozzle pieces. The landing gear is basically unchanged, it does the job alright. The radiator surfaces on the inside of the S-foils and the vents under the top S-foils are stickers, naturally. They work fine. Unfortunately, as with Obi-Wan&#39;s red Eta-2 in the Ultimate Space Battle set, there&#39;s no stickers for the white/light grey sections on the outer surfaces of the S-foils, which is a bummer - I guess here DSS stands for &quot;<i>Deficient</i> Sticker Sheet&quot;. The flaws of no lightsaber storage and no body for the astromech from the first set are repeated. Overall though, it looks nice and is very fun to swoosh around.</p>

<p>The ring itself is cleverly done, making good use of Technic parts. The elbow variety of the post-with-pinhole pieces enable the circular shape of the skeleton of the ring, while pins allow plates to be mounted with studs facing outward, giving the ring a more solid and bulky look as well as its color. The engines use existing space pod pieces as well as Technic wheels for the basic body, with various tile and dish pieces making up most of the detail. They use two of the 2x2 plate-with-pin-on-bottom piece to attach to the ring (very tightly, I might add - the engines will sooner pop off the pin plates than the pin plates will separate from the ring w/o being pushed). The central section of the ring, where the fighter docks, is nice and sturdy. The only weakness is that the flaps that close down on the fighter when it docks can come off if you&#39;re careless, but it&#39;s not that big a fault. It looks to sit a bit high when the fighter&#39;s in it, but again not that bad. And the ring is swooshable in is own right, especially with the fighter docked. All you have to do is grab by the middle. The ring also features flick-fire missiles. They&#39;re the &quot;cone on axle&quot; variety, so they fire very easily but don&#39;t stay locked in. As such they tend to fall out during swooshing. However, the ring doesn&#39;t look bad without them and since they&#39;re on long light bley axles they&#39;re reasonably easy to find.</p>

<p>The minifgures are alright. We get an ROTS Obi-Wan, who has some changes from previous ROTS Obi-Wans (pants color, mainly). He&#39;s alright. Unfortunately, he does not have his lightsaber. We also get a bonus Jedi, Kit Fisto. He does have a lightsaber. His head is PVC, and unfortunately doesn&#39;t grip his neck tightly (but on the plus side, the flexibility lets him sit in the chair in the cockpit). Still, he looks alright and it&#39;s nice to get him. As this is a starfighter set, neither of them have capes and Obi-Wan has a comlink headset included in his facial printing.</p>

<p>The box is also worth talking about. Many people wonder why it&#39;s so big. Well, wonder no more. The box is the size it is so that if you pop the booster ring&#39;s engines out of their sockets, you can pack the set neatly away in its box while it&#39;s still built. This was VERY thoughtful of LEGO.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Comes with the hyperdrive ring, which is nice to have especially since none was ever made for their original Delta-7 set.</li>
	<li>Captures the fighter in nice detail, makes an improvement from the original set of it</li>
	<li>Includes a bonus Kit Fisto.</li>
	<li>Box big enough to store the set in built form with only minor disassembly.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>No lightsaber for Obi-Wan.</li>
	<li>The cockpit canopy is unchanged, meaning it still relies on the viewport dish to click closed.</li>
	<li>The Technic hinge rig for the cockpit canopy has no friction, so if that dish is loose...</li>
	<li>No body for R4-G9. This was getting really old by this point.</li>
	<li>No stickers for detailing the outer surfaces of the S-foils.</li>
	<li>The box&#39;s means of closing is an idea that was better on paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was very happy to receive this set, and I think it was definitely worthwhile at the retail price and at the time. I still think it would be worth getting now, what with the inclusion of that hyperdrive ring. While they&#39;ve been busily remaking (and in some cases, re-remaking) just about everything from Revenge of the Sith, it&#39;s uncertain if this fighter will get remade or if such a remake would include the ring.</p>
