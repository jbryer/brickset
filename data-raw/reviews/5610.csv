The design of the MTT is extremely accurate and houses many clever designs and componants. The new improved destroyer droid is also featured in this set, the dorid is smoother looking and more accurate in terms of build. The set also features a droid scout cruiser which also doubles as a carrier (which really should of been part of the droid battle set.)The set includes:

2 X Droid pilots (blue)
2 X Droid commanders (red)

"Pegasi","2007-09-13T21:31:28.497Z","A glorious rendition of the MTT, although it is a step down from 112","I remember that when I first saw the phantom menace, the only thing that stood out to me was the battle droids, and this. I remember thinking 
   'god, it would be so cool if lego decided to make a model of this'

And they did. However, the first one (7184) was a little bit of a let down, especially because you can only carry six droids in it, wheras the ones in the movie carry 112.

So then, a few weeks ago, lego released this new, and in my eyes, (and probably everyone elses) infinitely supirior version. Although it is only around half scale, it would be completely unreasonable to expect TLC to release a full scale (for minifigs, not us) MTT.

Probably the only flaw, at least in my opinion, would be the Droideka. Yes, I am aware of the sheer number of people who have been raving about the droideka, but I don't really like it. I think that it is a little too big in comparison to the battle droids, and also it can't deploy into wheel mode any better than the previous version.

"weerwoefski","2007-12-15T06:20:04.373Z","Another nice collector!","I got this set for our holiday to Spain, so when we arrived I ran to the bedroom as fast as I could and started building it. The first thing I noticed were the 20 Figures with all-new-guns! Next was the nice new-brown color. As I started building the base, it was kinda big, but the more you build, the smaller it gets, and lot of plates where the battle droids could stand on, just disappear when building. They made(as usual)just enough room for the speeder and the grey thing that comes out, but if you modify it a little, you can put the securities also somewhere in there. The speeder is sleek and nice, but it was just like they put a bunch of lego pieces together; cause the pieces are only put on three baseplates, and almost nothing on top of them to hold them together better. The control room on the top is a bit small, you get just enough room to put the pilot droid in it. But when it was completely assembled, it was smaller as I expected.
Anyway, here are the Pro's and Con's:

Pro's:
 *A lot of figures, so a very nice army builder
 *Nice new guns
 *Nice brown color
 *Gun's on side have a cool design
 *The hatches have cool mechanisms
 *nice droid detacher with cool mechanism to deploy them
 *very good details

Con's:
 *Speeder is nice, but very unstable
 *the guns on side easily fall off
 *The destroyer droid should have had a ball mode
 *no place for the security droids, unless you make a few modifications

"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-05T00:40:33.967Z","Better than Ultimate Space Battle?","I was just looking at the sets I own and was surprised to see that the people who use the My Sets function on this site outvoted the Ultimate Space Battle, and the MTT is most wanted! I mean, my favourites would be either this or Ultimate Space Battle, and, chances are that if you are reading this then you would probably be completely desperate for this set. If you are unsure whether or not this set is worth your money, then you shouldn’t worry, because this is one of the best sets ever. Here are some reasons why it is absolutely necessary. 

When I first saw this set, I didn’t think I would ever get such an expensive or large set like this, and I didn’t even want this then. I’ve heard a lot about people instantly falling for this set and frankly I have never done that; for me it takes at least a week for climax. Anyway, it took a lot more time for me to like this set, and I had no inkling on how I would pay it off if I ever buy it. Oh well, I never saw this set cheap or at retail, and I never saw it in shops. In one particular seemingly fruitless attempt, however, I was in a mall. It had all the major companies that I trust. They all simultaneously, as I thought, let me down. And then lastly, I requested K-mart, which I had never found lego in before. I was completely surprised for three reasons. Firstly, K-mart had lego. Secondly, K-mart had the MTT. Thirdly, it was surprising that it had a few lots of everything. A battle pack or two, a motorized technic bulldozer, a large castle set, and this.  

Anyway, I stayed in the toy aisle, with the comforting box I held tightly in my eager hands, and then I begged my mother for it. Luckily, I had done a good job in a test and this was my prize, lucky me! We did a compromise. Anyway, we got home and then started construction.

I have seen various pictures of it on the internet before I bought it, and I even looked at the instructions. It was a massive model, I then discovered. There are a few places where I go to do research on the internet. Firstly, Brickset. I read through all the reviews until I am sure that it is a really good buy. Then, I search for images, on Lego Shop at Home. Then, I search for videos of it on Youtube. Brickset proved very helpful, and then the images from Shop at Home did also. I used the 360 spin feature, and saw all angles of it. In one angle it looked like a poorly made UCS car model. It was quite funny, and it didn’t take me long to extremely want it. On Youtube there were a few videos, I got jealous when a small child had received it for his birthday, and he was so small that he could hardly hold the box, or was unable to pronounce numbers on the front. Anyway, I was sure that it was going to last me a good long time when I bought it.

Construction was fun, when I constructed a certain piece separate to the model I would try to guess where it goes. When I make an addition to the model, I wonder what it is for. Anyway, it starts with the construction of the minifigures, except for the destroyer droid. The building of them I thought would be quite enjoyable, as they are my first battle droids to have accumulated. Really the construction of them all is a little boring and I just wanted to get on with the MTT. Still, they are really cool, 16 battle droids, 2 pilots, and 2 security droids. I liked them all, and together the battle droids do look like quite a number, though really you would think that they would be a diminutive group. The security droids are cool, and I could change them to a commander droid if I wanted to, because I have another set that has a yellow torso piece. The pilot droids have a nice blue colour, and you see a lot of them running round at the start of episode three, on the bridge in Grievous’s flagship.

There are a lot of pieces, lots of small and lots of large. I used the large pieces to help block off the small pieces from running off the table, ie, technic pins. The construction is made up of three chambers, which have three hatches each. The base sits on a neatly made technic base with small hidden wheels which really helps moving the thing. If you think that you can make this electrical, then you might be able to do it, its just that you can hardly fit a control unit inside, and when it is you need to make it stable. Anyway, the technic base is layered with some flat plates, which I find fun to apply, because then I can see how everything neatly comes to shape, unlike my MOCs. 

The first chamber is to hold a small, six stud wide scout. If you do not know what the scout is, it is a small hovering raised platform, kind of like a skiff. Anyway, basically it is a little bit like the large vehicle in the battle pack, except way better. It is narrow, has a pilot droid driving it, and has weaponry placed on the back. Well, really it can hold anything on the back. This is a new system lego made to allow any given eight by four plate to sit on a small slot, custom designed with the one eight by four piece. If you look at the back of the box you may see the MTT’s pilot droid on the scout, instructing the scout driver where it pleases to go. This is because you can take the pilot seat’s eight by four plate and place it where another eight by four slot is located. There are five interchangeable slots the MTT. One in the scout, one in the droid holder chamber, two in the droid rack, and one in the piloting chamber. These can all be changed and swapped around, so you can have a section of the droid rack on the skiff, in the droid holder chamber, or in the pilot’s room. You can place weaponry wherever you please.

The weaponry is really good, and this set is lucky that it was produced last year, or else the guns would be megaphones, and unless you have low self-esteem then you won’t be affected by insults, or whatever happens if you give a droid a megaphone. Anyway, the short pistols are the best in production, and because the longer rifles are in diminutive numbers I like to think that they are more powerful, but they come second best. I still like them though, its just that you cannot fight the same with guns that size. Where are the people going to put it? The short pistols are the best artillery I have ever had and I am building the number up, but the droids do need one each, except for the special ones. The customized arms really prevent the droids from looking like it’s their first day on the job, because they have special, twisted arms now. Finally, new guns and the ability to hold them properly. Great work lego, you’re learning!

Anyway, there are two long rifles on the scout, but you can put them anywhere. The pilot droid stands at the front, looking like a professional there, driving the neat little scout. The scout has a large chunk taken out of the back of it, and that is mainly to stop it being pushed out when the droid rack comes in because of the design of the beam. A small dome shaped piece with a small bright orange cone on it provided for a engine to help it go, and I modified that only slightly. What I noticed in the chamber was that the walls are really thick, and that was because they contained mostly of three brick high, two stud wide sloping bricks. They were brown in colour, and there were a lot of them sloping down, and that meant that the bottom would inevitably get thicker and thicker. The scout’s chamber has a control panel on the inside, the same one as the driver’s. It is long, and often minifigures get lost at the back and you have to get them out where the hatches only just cannot reach, and usually it’s a long process. There is enough room to store all of the droids in there easy, with or without the scout occupying most of the room. There are two hatches at the side, they open downwards, and a minifigure can stand on it, but cannot stay on it as it does not have studs positioned that way. There is a hatch at the front, for the scout to come out from. It is six studs wide like the scout and it can just fit in. Above this chamber is just the front roof, no second storey.    

The next chamber is the droid rack chamber. This kind of has two levels to it. It has the bottom storey of the droid rack and what’s underneath it, and then the top storey of the droid rack and their weapons. The droids fold up, and due to the design they can put their noses on their stomachs, if of course droids have those body parts. The problem with doing this, I discovered, is if you fold them up then after a while the clips on their legs wear out and then they cannot stand so straight. You can push on the clips while they are not connected to anything, but do not snap it, that sometimes works. Anyway, there are sixteen battle droids. They are in pairs folded up, and on the interchangeable four by eight plates so they can be taken out. I removed this feature well back, cause I didn’t find it that good, having things slip out. Kind of. Anyway, you cannot fit that many droids in pairs along a four by eight plate. So, there are two of them, one on top of the other. They are held in the droid rack, which isn’t too special.

The droid rack has two technic pins at the back of it, this allows a beam to grip on to it when it gets pulled back in. The beam is basically a lot of flat cogs on a two stud wide beam, which slides along some flat plates under it. On top of it is a cog that is connected to an axle which is connected to another cog that you spin. This rotates the other cog, which slides the beam out or in, which slide the droid rack out or in. For me, I didn’t worry about this function and instead took out the droid rack and used the chamber for a prisoner holding chamber. This works well because there is a small gap between the droid rack chamber ant the scout chamber, and you can squeeze a minifig through the gap and let him escape with the scout. The beam became useless but if I wanted to put the rack back I could. 

Again, this chamber has thick walls, and outside of it is engines, which bulk it up. The two back engines are basically composed of small cockpit windows that are brown, connected to a few slanted pieces connected to a very interesting piece that you probably would have come across before. It is a two by two connectable at the bottom, and it is a hollow almost sphere shape. It has half spheres that fit inside it and that makes it pivot. One of the half spheres has a stick poking out of it, and often these pieces fall off. The engine is then turned on a roughly 315 degree angle, (or 45 degree, it depends which side you are looking at it from), supported by one single technic pin. There is a black exposed type engine that is relly cool, but that is made during the base. It is just a few black bricks of the same type just thrown in together and it looks really good as far as engines go.

At the second storey of the droid rack chamber, there is a place for every droid’s gun to sit. It is another four by eight slot and it has two way bricks in it. It holds twenty guns and is level with two hatches. I took it out, and just put a suitably sized base in its place. Now minifigs can stand up on it with high danger of falling off when the hatch is open! The hatches at the sides open upwards, and are quite big and slanted on an angle very slighty. Everyone should know where the last hatch on the droid rack chamber goes. Yes, it’s the back one. It opens it really cool but does not open if you just spin the cog to push out the droid rack; you have to have it at least half open. It is a good hatch that is made up of two very large dome pieces, one on top of the other. That folds upwards. Then there is a small six by four black piece with corners slightly cut off that folds downwards assumingly simultaneously with the larger part of hatch. Droid rack comes out nicely, no problems.

The next chamber is positioned above the droid rack chamber, where the driver sits. He has his special drivers chair which allows him to sit, whereas normally droids don’t sit. There is a nice droid chair and window for him to look out of. The control panel sits in front of him and he can see out of his window, which is a dome piece that folds inwards. Otherwise he cannot see and probably crash the MTT, but really that is fun sometimes, and it’s a very sturdy structure. Anyway, he sits in a four by eight slot and has an MTT to drive which keeps him occupied. There are two side hatches, that are a lot smaller than the other ones, and they fold downwards. There is one at the top, and they fold up and forwards due to a sleek technic based design. It is sometimes irritating if you put real people minifigs in seats in that chamber because you cannot have anything wider than two studs in the mechanism. 

Droideka’s construction is slightly predictable once the pieces are all left over. I was really looking forward to the construction and it wasn’t that great. All I really wanted to know was how lego made him have three evenly spaced out legs, and how lego made him move. Lego had evenly spaced out legs because of a three way technic axle piece. Not even mildly interesting. As for the second question, lego didn’t even bother making him move. He is way too big, way too bulky and collapses easily. Just like the Buzz Droid, if you have one. If you are buying this for the destroyer droid, chances are you will keep everything else in the set because it is way better. The only flaw is the destroyer droid.

Overall, this set is the best or second best in my collection, and it does, as my title indicates, put up an impressive match with the Ultimate Space Battle. There is another thing that lego didn’t put in here that it puts in most sets, which is hidden missiles or guns on the actual ship. It would go well with some mobile tank thing from star wars as well, maybe Jabba’s Sail Barge. If this had guns on the structure it would be really cool having a fight between them. This structure is massive. You are often faced with the trouble of where to pick it up from. Usually wherever your hand span fits you will end up holding a hatch or two. The best way to hold it would be in the centre of its gravitational pull, in the middle, beside the big hatches. That is part of the main structure. The large amount of room on and inside the MTT is good for lightsaber duels.  This is to be understood; this model cannot hover, you have to hold it up, and because it is heavy you can’t do that for long. So you could use transparent blocks for holding it up on display. 

The model is really cool and at night if you look at the model it looks brilliant. It’s even better when you look at different colours. For example, you look for dark grey, then the dark grey looks really cool against the brown. It makes the model stand out and it is really effective. You can also do this with the 6209 Slave I model with the green colours, etc. 

This would be the best model you could ever acquire at the current time. No star wars collection is complete without it. You need this set, even at the price it is this set is well worth it, you are getting a lot of pieces and a lot of fun and entertainment. You need to buy this set, you’ve heard this hundreds of times, trust me, this is a good buy!
You are not a star wars collector without it!

Also, this set has lots of features packed into it. There are opening doors everywhere, in the back, on the sides, the front, the top, and on the side of the top. It has little wheels on the bottom which roll great. The biggest problem besides it taking forever to take the droids out of the rack and set them up, was that the doors on the side of the cockpit, at the top, often break if you try to open them. And don't put stuff in this that's not supposed to go in it, cause you will have a hard time getting it out, and it might screw up the device that rolls out the rack with the droids on it.

I can't actually see why Lego  made this set. I mean, it's got 20 BATTLE DROIDS! That excedes their usual minifig limit by a mile! Now, onto the set.

The build of this set is extremely sturdy and Lego have obviously spent quite a while designing it. I like the removable platforms so you can mix and match the different things that the little repulsorlift vehicle is carrying. The new Droideka is kinda dumb, but you can put that in some back-of-the-cupboard box. Teehee. The droid rack mechanism is extremely good and works consistently well. The back compartment is really good for the repulsorlift vehicle, which can just slide in and out without any hassle at all. Now onto pros and cons:

Pros:

Great build
Lots of hatches
New Pilot and Security Droids

I really don't think pilots need blasters in their hand while piloting an MTT, so i gave it to any troooper who doesn't have any guns. Now, the destroyer droid, is a little bit weird.

You see, when I started collecting lego star was sets back in 2002, I didn't get them because they were legos, I got the because they were star wars. I was a huge fan of star wars(and still am), but other legos didn't interest me. Anyways, back around this time last year, I went to lego.com as I always did, and went to the star wars theme and noticed that they had added a new subtheme, Episode I. I was so excited considering that at the time I only owned two episode I sets. However, when I clicked on the episode I, it didn't show any sets, so I decided to go searching on google for some pics of these sets or even names for that matter. One link took me to the LEGO section of amazon.com and somewhere on that page I read a small profile of the history of the LEGO company and was surprised to find out that the LEGO company actually was started in the country of Denmark. I also learned the name of the creator of LEGO, and where lego got it's name from(leggodt, which is my username), but the fact that lego got started in Denmark was what really surprised me because I always thought that LEGO started in the U.S.; the fact that some other not really noticed european country started lego just sounded really cool to me. So I decided to start getting other lego sets rather than just star wars.  

Anyways, I eventally turned up two sets on the lego website one of which was the MTT. It wouldn't be until august when I got the set, but all that searching on the internet got me interested in searching for more sets like the near future 2008 sets. One of the links took me to a little lego website called.........brickset! That's right! This set is what lead me to brickset. Because of that link, I got more and more interested in the site, and finally joined the site on the night of November 30, 2007. 

I own around 70 different lego star wars sets, and for a long time I've been trying to decide which is my favorite, and for what reason. Well, I have finally made my decision, my favorite out of all my lego sets, star wars or non-star wars, my favorite is the 7662 Trade Federation MTT, because it lead me to LEGO and to brickset. I would definitely get this set; it's great for anyone in need of a droid army, and an expierience that could change your life forever. . . . . . . .

"Phoenixfighter","2009-04-29T03:32:42.293Z","7662 Trade Federation MTT"," If you are unsure whether or not this set is worth your money, then you shouldn’t worry, because this is one of the best sets ever. Here are some reasons why it is absolutely necessary. 

When I first saw this set, I didn’t think I would ever get such an expensive or large set like this, and I didn’t even want this then. I’ve heard a lot about people instantly falling for this set and frankly I have never done that; for me it takes at least a week for climax. Anyway, it took a lot more time for me to like this set, and I had no inkling on how I would pay it off if I ever buy it. I discovered the excellence of this set when I was hanging out at my friends house who is seriously high on LEGO and one of his new sets was this. It took me a few visits to actually want it, but when I did... It was serious

Anyway, I ended up getting the MTT for christmas, which I had specifically asked for.

I have seen various pictures of it on the internet before I bought it, and I even looked at the instructions. It was a massive model, I then discovered. There are a few places where I go to do research on the internet. Firstly, Brickset. I read through all the reviews until I am sure that it is a really good buy. Then, I search for images, on Lego Shop at Home. Then, I search for videos of it on Youtube. Brickset proved very helpful, and then the images from Shop at Home did also. I used the 360 spin feature, and saw all angles of it. In one angle it looked like a poorly made UCS car model. It was quite funny, and it didn’t take me long to extremely want it. On Youtube there were a few videos, I got jealous when a small child had received it for his birthday, and he was so small that he could hardly hold the box, or was unable to pronounce numbers on the front. Anyway, I was sure that it was going to last me a good long time when I bought it.

Construction was fun, when I constructed a certain piece separate to the model I would try to guess where it goes. When I make an addition to the model, I wonder what it is for. Anyway, it starts with the construction of the minifigures, except for the destroyer droid. The building of them I thought would be quite enjoyable, as they are my first battle droids to have accumulated. Really the construction of them all is a little boring and I just wanted to get on with the MTT. Still, they are really cool, 16 battle droids, 2 pilots, and 2 security droids. I liked them all, and together the battle droids do look like quite a number, though really you would think that they would be a diminutive group. The security droids are cool, and I could change them to a commander droid if I wanted to, because I have another set that has a yellow torso piece. The pilot droids have a nice blue colour, and you see a lot of them running round at the start of episode three, on the bridge in Grievous’s flagship.

There are a lot of pieces, lots of small and lots of large. I used the large pieces to help block off the small pieces from running off the table, ie, technic pins. The construction is made up of three chambers, which have three hatches each. The base sits on a neatly made technic base with small hidden wheels which really helps moving the thing. If you think that you can make this electrical, then you might be able to do it, its just that you can hardly fit a control unit inside, and when it is you need to make it stable. Anyway, the technic base is layered with some flat plates, which I find fun to apply, because then I can see how everything neatly comes to shape, unlike my MOCs. 

The first chamber is to hold a small, six stud wide scout. If you do not know what the scout is, it is a small hovering raised platform, kind of like a skiff. Anyway, basically it is a little bit like the large vehicle in the battle pack, except way better. It is narrow, has a pilot droid driving it, and has weaponry placed on the back. Well, really it can hold anything on the back. This is a new system lego made to allow any given eight by four plate to sit on a small slot, custom designed with the one eight by four piece. If you look at the back of the box you may see the MTT’s pilot droid on the scout, instructing the scout driver where it pleases to go. This is because you can take the pilot seat’s eight by four plate and place it where another eight by four slot is located. There are five interchangeable slots the MTT. One in the scout, one in the droid holder chamber, two in the droid rack, and one in the piloting chamber. These can all be changed and swapped around, so you can have a section of the droid rack on the skiff, in the droid holder chamber, or in the pilot’s room. You can place weaponry wherever you please.

The weaponry is really good, and this set is lucky that it was produced last year, or else the guns would be megaphones, and unless you have low self-esteem then you won’t be affected by insults, or whatever happens if you give a droid a megaphone. Anyway, the short pistols are the best in production, and because the longer rifles are in diminutive numbers I like to think that they are more powerful, but they come second best. I still like them though, its just that you cannot fight the same with guns that size. Where are the people going to put it? The short pistols are the best artillery I have ever had and I am building the number up, but the droids do need one each, except for the special ones. The customized arms really prevent the droids from looking like it’s their first day on the job, because they have special, twisted arms now. Finally, new guns and the ability to hold them properly. Great work lego, you’re learning!

Anyway, there are two long rifles on the scout, but you can put them anywhere. The pilot droid stands at the front, looking like a professional there, driving the neat little scout. The scout has a large chunk taken out of the back of it, and that is mainly to stop it being pushed out when the droid rack comes in because of the design of the beam. A small dome shaped piece with a small bright orange cone on it provided for a engine to help it go, and I modified that only slightly. What I noticed in the chamber was that the walls are really thick, and that was because they contained mostly of three brick high, two stud wide sloping bricks. They were brown in colour, and there were a lot of them sloping down, and that meant that the bottom would inevitably get thicker and thicker. The scout’s chamber has a control panel on the inside, the same one as the driver’s. It is long, and often minifigures get lost at the back and you have to get them out where the hatches only just cannot reach, and usually it’s a long process. There is enough room to store all of the droids in there easy, with or without the scout occupying most of the room. There are two hatches at the side, they open downwards, and a minifigure can stand on it, but cannot stay on it as it does not have studs positioned that way. There is a hatch at the front, for the scout to come out from. It is six studs wide like the scout and it can just fit in. Above this chamber is just the front roof, no second storey. 

The next chamber is the droid rack chamber. This kind of has two levels to it. It has the bottom storey of the droid rack and what’s underneath it, and then the top storey of the droid rack and their weapons. The droids fold up, and due to the design they can put their noses on their stomachs, if of course droids have those body parts. The problem with doing this, I discovered, is if you fold them up then after a while the clips on their legs wear out and then they cannot stand so straight. You can push on the clips while they are not connected to anything, but do not snap it, that sometimes works. Anyway, there are sixteen battle droids. They are in pairs folded up, and on the interchangeable four by eight plates so they can be taken out. I removed this feature well back, cause I didn’t find it that good, having things slip out. Kind of. Anyway, you cannot fit that many droids in pairs along a four by eight plate. So, there are two of them, one on top of the other. They are held in the droid rack, which isn’t too special.

The droid rack has two technic pins at the back of it, this allows a beam to grip on to it when it gets pulled back in. The beam is basically a lot of flat cogs on a two stud wide beam, which slides along some flat plates under it. On top of it is a cog that is connected to an axle which is connected to another cog that you spin. This rotates the other cog, which slides the beam out or in, which slide the droid rack out or in. For me, I didn’t worry about this function and instead took out the droid rack and used the chamber for a prisoner holding chamber. This works well because there is a small gap between the droid rack chamber ant the scout chamber, and you can squeeze a minifig through the gap and let him escape with the scout. The beam became useless but if I wanted to put the rack back I could. 

Again, this chamber has thick walls, and outside of it is engines, which bulk it up. The two back engines are basically composed of small cockpit windows that are brown, connected to a few slanted pieces connected to a very interesting piece that you probably would have come across before. It is a two by two connectable at the bottom, and it is a hollow almost sphere shape. It has half spheres that fit inside it and that makes it pivot. One of the half spheres has a stick poking out of it, and often these pieces fall off. The engine is then turned on a roughly 315 degree angle, (or 45 degree, it depends which side you are looking at it from), supported by one single technic pin. There is a black exposed type engine that is relly cool, but that is made during the base. It is just a few black bricks of the same type just thrown in together and it looks really good as far as engines go.

At the second storey of the droid rack chamber, there is a place for every droid’s gun to sit. It is another four by eight slot and it has two way bricks in it. It holds twenty guns and is level with two hatches. I took it out, and just put a suitably sized base in its place. Now minifigs can stand up on it with high danger of falling off when the hatch is open! The hatches at the sides open upwards, and are quite big and slanted on an angle very slighty. Everyone should know where the last hatch on the droid rack chamber goes. Yes, it’s the back one. It opens it really cool but does not open if you just spin the cog to push out the droid rack; you have to have it at least half open. It is a good hatch that is made up of two very large dome pieces, one on top of the other. That folds upwards. Then there is a small six by four black piece with corners slightly cut off that folds downwards assumingly simultaneously with the larger part of hatch. Droid rack comes out nicely, no problems.

The next chamber is positioned above the droid rack chamber, where the driver sits. He has his special drivers chair which allows him to sit, whereas normally droids don’t sit. There is a nice droid chair and window for him to look out of. The control panel sits in front of him and he can see out of his window, which is a dome piece that folds inwards. Otherwise he cannot see and probably crash the MTT, but really that is fun sometimes, and it’s a very sturdy structure. Anyway, he sits in a four by eight slot and has an MTT to drive which keeps him occupied. There are two side hatches, that are a lot smaller than the other ones, and they fold downwards. There is one at the top, and they fold up and forwards due to a sleek technic based design. It is sometimes irritating if you put real people minifigs in seats in that chamber because you cannot have anything wider than two studs in the mechanism. 

Droideka’s construction is slightly predictable once the pieces are all left over. I was really looking forward to the construction and it wasn’t that great. All I really wanted to know was how lego made him have three evenly spaced out legs, and how lego made him move. Lego had evenly spaced out legs because of a three way technic axle piece. Not even mildly interesting. As for the second question, lego didn’t even bother making him move. He is way too big, way too bulky and collapses easily. Just like the Buzz Droid, if you have one. If you are buying this for the destroyer droid, chances are you will keep everything else in the set because it is way better. The only flaw is the destroyer droid.

Overall, this set is the best or second best in my collection, and it does, as my title indicates, put up an impressive match with the Ultimate Space Battle. There is another thing that lego didn’t put in here that it puts in most sets, which is hidden missiles or guns on the actual ship. It would go well with some mobile tank thing from star wars as well, maybe Jabba’s Sail Barge. If this had guns on the structure it would be really cool having a fight between them. This structure is massive. You are often faced with the trouble of where to pick it up from. Usually wherever your hand span fits you will end up holding a hatch or two. The best way to hold it would be in the centre of its gravitational pull, in the middle, beside the big hatches. That is part of the main structure. The large amount of room on and inside the MTT is good for lightsaber duels. This is to be understood; this model cannot hover, you have to hold it up, and because it is heavy you can’t do that for long. So you could use transparent blocks for holding it up on display. 

The model is really cool and at night if you look at the model it looks brilliant. It’s even better when you look at different colours. For example, you look for dark grey, then the dark grey looks really cool against the brown. It makes the model stand out and it is really effective. You can also do this with the 6209 Slave I model with the green colours, etc. 

This would be the best model you could ever acquire at the current time. No star wars collection is complete without it. You need this set, even at the price it is this set is well worth it, you are getting a lot of pieces and a lot of fun and entertainment. You need to buy this set, you’ve heard this hundreds of times, trust me, this is a good buy!

"spartanlee","2009-04-30T17:47:50.42Z","a lot of minifigs","i love this set. it is worth the money in nearly every aspect.

first off you get 16 normal battle droids, 2 security battle droids, 2 pilot battle droids, and a awful droideka. i liked the pilot and security droids, but the droideka sucked. the arms never stayed up and always fell out. they could have made this a lot better

the speeder was nice. i like how you can switch out the radar dish for the pilot's chair, a rack of battle droids, or their weapons.

everything stores in nicely except for the security droids and the droideka. i was able to find a spot to stand the droids in the room with the speeder and i never really used the droideka at all

the battle droid racks come out easy with a gear on the side to turn and move them out. however the doors had to be pushed closed.

there are a lot of doors and view ports on this set. there are three near the pilot, three at the droid dispenser(if you count the front), and three at the back. i found that the side windows for the pilot can pop off if you are not gentle

this set takes a while to put together(plan to donate 2-3 days for it) it took me a while to actually start because some of the pieces were hard to find due to the amount of bags.

the actual MTT looks good and realistic. i like how it is set on six wheels to give the illusion of hovering. there is a lot of detail even on the inside and like i said the build takes a while

Pros:
  Lots of droids
  a good speeder
  amazing detail
  good droid dispenser
  lots of view ports
  the interchangeable racks for the speeder
  blasters for all the battle droids
  the wheels on the underside
  and much more

Cons:
  the droideka
  i didn't like the gray pieces in the hull, it looks less realistic but that is a minor con

"lego_legend89","2010-05-04T19:06:24.513Z","A classic in the making","<p>This set has so much to it that it's hard to explain in a short review. It really is the main transport for the federation, and if you collect like me this is a ""must get"" set for the seperatists army. It gives you so many battle droids that it is hard to pass up. Everything is great all the function work fine, and even the much debuted droidika is good. My favorite part are the wheels. They're very sturdy, and a blast to roll around. The only bad part of the set is that battle droids contain so many pieces that it is hard to keep track of all of them. It is a long build, but that is what makes it so industructable.

One problem with this set is that the arms on the destroyer droid always fall down or off. Another problem is that when you are turning the knob to get the battle droids out, the rack might get stuck or fall off. The little speeder goes good with this set.

"arl100","2012-09-10T14:32:53.563Z","Far better than the last one","<p>The title says it all. This model is a vast improvement on the original Lego brought out in 2000, both the model itself and the amount of figures you receive with it. The model itself is a lot more sturdy (you don't think that each time you pick it up it could break in half if the pins failed) and the droid capacity has far increased, with 16 droids in the carrier rather than 6, as well as a small craft that fits in the back of the MTT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The droideka is also good as well, helping to add to the 'Battle of Naboo' element this set is based around. This set takes a lot of work to build, but is even worse to dismantle, as unlike many other craft in Star Wars there is no simple starting point (e.g. cockpit or a wing), which helps to make the model far more rigid. Unfortunately, the demand for this quality of set has helped to drive up its price significantly in the 5 years it has been around, and many have been selling at over £150 used/opened, far more for a sealed set. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent droid capacity</li><li>Vast exterior and interior improvements</li><li>Droideka</li><li>Moves easy on wheels</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Quite heavy to lift</li><li>Quite difficult to disassemble</li><li>Likely to cost a fair bit to obtain one.</li><li></li></ul>

"RundownPear","2022-04-27T18:51:06.773Z","A Fan Favorite Classic","<p>There isn&#39;t much to say about this set. THe MTT looks pretty decent, scales well to figures, includes a really nice speeder which can carry one of the many modules included in the set (blaster storage, droid rack, communication station), a killer play feature with the large droid holder which can transport 16 battle droids, and to go with that a ton of droids.</p>

<p>The build is mostly brick-based with a few plates. It&#39;s sturdy and easy to follow and looks alright. Its size makes up for its inaccurate proportions and it ends up looking quite good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures are perfect. This is basically a mega droid battle pack with&nbsp;2 pilots, 2 security droids, 16 B1s, and a so-and-so droideka. The droids, except for the droideka, fit in the vehicle. The droideka is definitely the weakest aspect of this build as it doesn&#39;t really look great, is oversized, and has basically no articulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For only $100 when this was released it was a steal back then and has aged very well compared to the other sets of that era. Its not hard to see why this set is so well regarded compared to the newer smaller 2014 variant, despite that version having a significant price decrease and better shaping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
