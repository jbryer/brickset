There is a arm to pick up trash cans, one comes with this set. Nice bright colors. You also get a hand cart, broom, shovel, and one minifig. Real good addition to my city.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"miies","2007-05-26T17:03:43.243Z","Ah, the memories!","Lego often recycles (pun intended) older models: this truck is clearly an updated version of the classic &quot;6693 Refuse Collection Truck&quot;. The new cement truck, by the way, has a predecessor too (6682).

I absolutely love this garbage truck: the container tilting arms are innovative, the orange color is cool and it just looks exactly real. Way to go Lego!

I have been really annoyed for the last couple of years over the fact that the Town/City theme consisted of only police/fire/rescue sets. But this year, Lego finally seems to go back to the theme's roots. I'm really thrilled to see harbors, garbage trucks and houses again. Again - way to go Lego!

It didn't take me very long to complete (probably 20 minutes tops), but it was time well spent. I absolutely love the way the dumping mechanism works. Very well thought out. The colors are terrific. I agree with previous reviewers though, it would've been nice to have another minifigure included to ride on the tailboard. This set is completely worth it for the price. It would be worth the price alone for the cool unique pieces, such as the trash can and the hand cart. I like the way that Lego is going with their new sets. All seem to be breaking away from the previous &quot;juniorization&quot; phase, and are getting back to what they used to be. This has helped me regain interest in Lego all over again!

I'm not 100% sure about the colour, as I don't like having a lot of different colours in my Lego. However, if I didn't have this hang-up I would think the colour choice was great.

Such a great rebount from the &quot;two&quot; special-color-unique-only-in-this-set-brick sets of just a few years ago. 

Picket the set up at a local store for 16,95 EURO, 23 USD. Retails at 14.99 USD, 11 EURO in the USA. European Taxation... :( 

Sets reminds me a bit of 6693, but only a bit. With the new design, new color scheme, and at 6 studs wide it has a totaly different feel to it. 

pros:
-real cool design!!
-only use of current standard bricks!! a huge plus!
-six studs wide
-cool minifig
-cool system to empty the garbage cans. 
-can easily be fixed to take two garbage cans simultaneously! :)
-fits nicely in the current city line

Cons:
-couldnt think of anything at the moment... well... could have been bigger.. 8 studs wide or so :P. Probably wouldnt fit in the current city line though... oh well.

Only one minifig is included so he has to drive and get out to empty the bins himself.  And like all other recent city vehicles, there are no doors to make his life easier when working on his own!

"diverdan","2007-08-19T10:46:40.13Z","Great City addtion","
I just noticed this… the name on this website says “recycle truck” but on the box it came in, it says “garbage truck” So I don’t know which is right but any way…
This is my first Lego city set (excluding trains) and I have to say it was an excellent set. After this great set I think I will be getting more.

First thing I noticed was numbered bags. (Which are in most sets)
There are a lot of orange pieces, which I don’t see a lot of.
The detail of the cab is superb. I don’t know when Lego came out with the 1x1 slope but since then every Lego vehicle seems to have them. (Which makes for great detail)
The dumping mechanism works great and is very fun to dump the &quot;garbage&quot;
Comes with a garbage can that hooks on an arm that dumps it into the back of the truck. This set come with a lot of accessories... a dolly, a mini fig, garbage can, shovel, and broom.
Only thing I didn't like was the recycle symbol on the side!?
It's a garbage truck not a recycle truck!
And the orange color... it's nice but I would have like to see green. And the Wheels should have been on axles not pins..
Over all a great set with lots of detail nice pieces, and great playability.

The cab is great, with a nice looking front end, and all of the details that make it stand out.  The dumping mechanism works really well, and it can hold a lot of ? recyclables ?

The minifig is great, with his little goatee and smile, he really likes his job, and who wouldn't if you got to drive around in a fancy rig like this.

Another great feature is how the truck is built separate from the dumper on the back, so it can be easily customized depending on what your Lego city needed.

"legoguysw","2008-08-22T05:05:59.343Z","Great, but a few small flaws","This is basically a Recycle truck, released in 2007. It includes one minifig, plus a shovel, broom, small cart thing, rubbish bin, and rubbish (18 or so small 1x1 studs).
The cab is very roomy, but only has one seat. It would have been great to see another for a second rubbish collector, but having 2 minifigures would have been pushing it. Plus, to have 2 seats, the whole vehichle would have too be widened, so that's fine really.  Another con is the lack of doors- they just needed to replace the 1x2 and 1x1 bricks with two 1x3 doors, but no. Like many 07 vehichles, there is a flat piece with the lights and number plate that is stuck on the front. I personally love this idea. The roof ists on fine, supported at the back by those rail pieces, and at the back of the roof are some lights. on the back of the cab are 2 big exhaust piece things, perfect for any hot rods!
Onto the main feature- the, um, dumper thing. this is really a big box, and i thikn it is a bit blocky really. On the back is a piece that can move up and down to allow the rubbish to be tipped out, as well as to keep it in there when not wanted. It has a platform underneath for the cleaners to stand on, and on each side are places for the shovel and broom to be stored. There is this cool feature where you attatch the rubbish bin to a robot arm piece, and you can lift it up and down to tip the rubbish in. Howver, this doesn't always work very well! On top of the dumper is a place the cart thing can be put on, which works very well. The only other flaw is the stcikers, but at least tyhey are put to good use.

"BrickPiet44","2008-11-19T09:04:21.56Z","Great set for playability, design, detail","This set is one of the sets with which Lego has proven to be on the right track again.

- The truck is 6 studs wide, which is a big improvement compaired with the previous trucks of 4 studs wide. It is much more in proportion.
- The new front with head lights is also an improvement, it looks much better than the previous designs.
- The mechanism for the garbage bin at the back of the truck works fine although it is not very sturdy.
- The mechanism for dumping works well, it has bene well designed.
- The number of extras is good: a minifig, a garbage bin, a shovel, a dolly, even some garbage (round 1x1's).
- The set has of course again different rear mirrors from the other trucks from this series, that again is a nice feature with which Lego proves to have an eye for detail again.

One really down side to the design: the driver's seat is in the middle of the cabin and the back of the cabin has a hole in it to make space for the seat. A design flaw that any AFOL can correct with a simple 2x1x2 high plate. So Lego could also have done so. This is something for future designs to be corrected.

Another down is of course the stickers. This is never a joy, they always wear off after a while. Not to be repeated! Please don't!

I thought the way the designers made the hand truck hook onto the roof was intresting, but not very realistic. The color scheme is also ingenious. The only way to make this truck complete, though, is for there to be two guys instead of just one. One could drive and one could hang on to the back and sweep up the trash.

On a completely random visit last week, there it was!   Just three left on the shelf, so that soon became two left on the shelf …

It’s a really good addition to the City series; I love the bright colour scheme of the truck and the realistic lines found on the real thing.   Construction was a pleasing hour spent, no problems encountered and a great display piece at the end.

The driver’s cab is simple, complete with high grill, lights and tinted windscreen.   Unfortunately no cab doors are provided and this area can only seat one minifig (which is all that is provided).   At the rear of the cab are twin bed mounted vertical exhausts, small wing mirrors are mounted underneath the windscreen (perhaps these are out of scale but still very neat in appearance).   On the roof of the cab are mounted twin sets of air-horns adjacent to the yellow ‘light’ bar.   

The container part of the truck follows the white and orange colour scheme of the truck cab; it features a solid build with brackets mounted on either side to facilitate effortless raising and lowering of this section for unloading purposes back at the depot.   At the far rear end of the truck is the lifting rear door arrangement which features a lifting bracket as an aid to the unloading process of the typical household dustbin.   Also provided are overhead floodlights for those dark mornings, a rear platform with warning chevrons and those all-important grab handles for the crew to hang on to while the vehicle is in motion.

The minifig is provided in a smart orange and green uniform, the trousers resemble those ‘fluorescent’ work trousers as seen on many public service personnel and he wears a black baseball cap.   Also provided is a two-wheel truck for use in transporting the various dustbins from their locations to the rear of the truck to be emptied; this is stored on a bracket high on the roof of the truck!   I’m not really sure how this is supposed to be ‘accessed’ by the minifig, but at least it is stored securely and neatly.

So, overall I am really pleased I finally got this set, some reviewers have commented on the flimsy rear door arrangement, I can’t say that I have experienced this problem, but like all my other sets, they get built and placed on display.   Perhaps one small gripe with this set is that Lego could have provided a second minifig; my poor chap has to drive the machine and empty the dustbins, I hope he is well-paid … plus Health and Safety would have a field day with his bosses…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I also like the fact the wheels are lower down from the curved bricks surrounding the wheels as opposed to the 2012 green truck which just looks a bit...<i>wrong</i>&nbsp;being so close to the curves.</div><div><br></div>Bought this just very recently for £14.99 buy it now off ebay. Bargain. Prices of discontinued Lego rises so I was lucky finding it for the same sort of retail price as when it was originally on sale in 2007.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I enjoyed building it. Quick and easy and interesting way of constructing it. I like the tipper at the rear. I do think it should have come with two mini figures as there is a footplate and hand grabs at the rear. Thats my only gripe.</div><div><br></div><div>Set 5611 with the mini figure and street cleaning bits as well as an orange refuse bin compliments the refuse truck extremely well. I bought it and plan on using the mini figure from this set with the refuse truck so it can have a driver and bin man.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

The overall look is nice. The flaw I see is the back part of the truck comes apart very easily, which hurts playablity. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Garbage/Recycle Truck (Never seen before) 
<li>Orange Color/ Overall Look 
<li>Trash can/broom/dolly</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rear of truck falls apart</li></ul>
<p>I almost paid $30 on this set through Ebay, but as I said this set is a Must have. If you can get your hands on one get it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
"ViceMan","2011-09-20T14:51:41.797Z","A very well-rounded set.","A good set that offers something different from the ceaseless fire, police and construction sets, and also a sorely needed set for any city's infrastructure. The set is quite a sturdy build, except for the rear mechanism at the back which seems to come off quite easily if handled incorrectly (which all children will inevitably do.) The hinged piece that opens the rear should have ideally been held down with another layer of flat plates to stop this happening. A minor oversight which while easily fixed could lead to some frustration in the long-term.<br><br>I improved the set by buying some 1x8 and 1x4 grey tiles to place in the bed of the tipper, and a lot more round 1x1 tiles to fill the tipper itself. But these aren't necessary as the set is quite adequate as it is.<br><br>The real review will be when my niece builds and tests it out. But in my opinion this is a great set and something unique to have, so make sure you get one while you can as they are quite rare.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Andy317","2018-06-07T17:45:54.873Z","A Pleasant Surprise!","<p>This is a pretty solid set, and though I might be bias for loving the color orange, it has a pretty darn cool look to it. It&rsquo;s very playable and I think you get a good deal for your 17 bucks, which is a random price but I&rsquo;ll take it over 20. Overall, a fun set from my childhood that I&rsquo;d buy sealed for 35-45 bucks on eBay.&nbsp;</p>

"HaulingBricks","2023-04-04T15:14:47.85Z","Recycle Truck 7991","<p>I have wanted to like this set but just can&#39;t bring myself to do so.&nbsp; I am not a fan of the design, part usage or playability.&nbsp; Overall, it isn&#39;t a &quot;bad&quot; truck, it just isn&#39;t as good as a lot of other trucks from this time period.</p>

<p>The build itself is lacking.&nbsp; There are a few too many voids in the frame/chassis for my liking.&nbsp; Voids that are visible on the completed model, even.&nbsp; The front grill plate falls off too easily for me as well.</p>

<p>The part usage of this model is not what one would expect from a set from 2007; especially when other similar sets were so profound.&nbsp; I felt the design of this truck was a bit lazy and actually impacted playability.&nbsp; It is a good value for the price but would have been a much better truck with a handful more pieces helping reinforce some weak areas.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the playability should have been off the chain but is hindered by poor design choices.&nbsp; Namely, the rear compartment can&#39;t support its own weight on the double locking hinges it is mounted to.&nbsp; It is more likely to fall off than stay open.&nbsp; Seeing as this in the main function of the can on the back, it was a bit of a let-down.</p>

<p>7991 is just too much of a fragile truck to get a good review from me.</p>
