"brickbuilder711","2007-11-04T01:27:05.2Z","Amazing Set!","I am happy that LEGO City is making a comeback. I was very happy with the gas station too. Let's tour the submodels:

1. The vehicles:
I loved the simple car but disliked the stickers for the motorbike. 

2. Food Mart
The bottles are a nice touch and I like the simplicity of the interior. Not much inventory though. The vending machine was enjoyable too.

3. Car Wash
Great, but the fans look kind of odd and the steering wheel lacks realism, but in my own opinion. The details are great though. Neat little traffic light too.

4. Pumps
They are perfect down to the last detail. I liked the brush and the bucket, very nice touch.

Though the gas station had flaws, I like how it sticks to LEGO's &quot;Octan&quot; branding. A must have for fans of all ages!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"danim","2007-11-25T18:14:19.937Z","Good Set","This set is brilliant, love the car and the fuel price board are amazing, the car wash is also very nice had to redesign the garage to incorperate this into my lego city<br>GET THIS SET IF YOU CAN, ITS STUNNING",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Elle82","2008-01-01T18:59:19.17Z","Town Must","If you dont have a petrol station, might aswell get this one. I have an older Octan one, and it just looks ugly compared to this one. Yes this set couldve been improved, but Lego are yet to put out a set that meets everyones approval. They didnt release a tanker, so one does wonder how they are supplied with their fuel. Motorbike is pretty ugly. And perhaps they couldve added a better convenience store, maybe a starbucks or subway on the side?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T18:50:22.92Z","The Best ever","This set is the most awesome gas station ever. The overall design of the building is very nice and sleek. The set comes with a car, motorcycle, carwash, gas nozzles, gas pump and meter, drinks, vending machine, special glass pieces, advertisment board, cash register, broom, shovel, brush and water bucket, spinning sign and three minifigs. Although I prefer the old 1x5x6 wall pieces. The car wash is so good a full sized ambulance could fit through it! Although the shop is empty inside. I solved that by adding a donut stand and coffee machine. The motorcycle and car is nice as well. This set was worth the money. You must get it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"packmania","2008-08-16T16:59:57.357Z","Enjoyed building it but...","This was fun to build, but then it comes to plugging it into your town and then the problems begin.  A) The road widths don't match the other road baseplates and B) The carwash sticks out the side and makes it awkward to fit into a town scene without it looking odd.

Love the set but lego still haven't got the point that to build a city things need to fit together...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lotographia","2009-03-20T05:31:35.06Z","Hose nozzle actually dispenses Doctor Pepper.","My lego city is 'free plan', so it doesn't bother me that part of this set sticks out the back and makes it difficult to fit in with a grid of baseplates. In my city, anything goes.

Simply put, I love this set... I love the detail, I love that it reminds me of the old Lego sets, I love the usage of transparent bluish giant flag things, I love the customised motorcycle, I love the way the car cleaners are pulled together by a rubber band, I love that it's not just another police or fire station. I even love the way the guy with the customised motorcycle is actually a postman.

Maybe the shop could have had a more detailed and extensive interior, but otherwise the set is more or less flawless.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Noah1997","2009-06-29T15:10:21.75Z","great gas station","This is the kind of set that you can play with for a long time, there is just two bad things about it, the drink cooler fall's down easaly, and the pointing stickers peel up easaly. The yellow car is great! the best thing about the set is, it is a grosery store and a gas station, if you need a store ore a gas station get this set.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"HQuiff","2009-06-25T08:59:50.53Z","What Happened To The Baseplate?","I got this for €44.99 in my local Toymaster and was thrilled to get it! Though it's a bit pricey, it's an Octan Garage, and Octan Garages are always good.

Build - 6/10. I would have loved the build, if it were not have been for the baseplate. I don't know if it's meant to be like this, or it just was, but in any case the baseplate made it almost impossible. 
For some reason all the studs on the board were were big, and didn't include the word LEGO® on all the studs, where it should have done. Apart from that everything else is grand, the pieces fit on well to each other.

Minifigs - 7/10. Not bad, we have a nice looking standard Octan guy, and two civilians, who are a bit better then usual consider the theme is City.

Price - 8/10. A bit expensive, but worth it. The variety of pieces and the amount of them is quite good. So yeah, I guess it's alright.

Vehicles - 9/10. A car and a motorcycle. The motorcycle is quite nice, and uses quite a nice use of stickers, as vinyls. And the car is simple, plus yellow.

The Building - 9/10. Here we have a nice Car Wash, which is very functional and is a tad more detailed then the Town Plan's one, consider it has a little spinning thing (Forgive me for forgetting it's name). 
Next we have the Filling Station, a nice and simple bit with pumps, however I preferred the wire on the Town Plan's Octan Station. Oh, and another nice thing is the amazing space allowed to fit vehicles in.
Then at last we get to the paying till. Very simple, plus you have different stuff outside it, which make it very detailed.

And on that note I must finish. I'd say overall 4/5.
Hope you found this useful!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"greshmalum","2009-12-14T16:26:26.467Z","Oh....","This set is so awesome. I really, really, seriously wish that i hadn't broken it. The windows are cool. Transparent light blue part hollow windows on the Car Wash section are cool. the way the driers move is cool. the shop part is nice, and so is the way that there are Gatorades and sodas on the outside by the windows and a keypad  locked water dispenser. On the Brickset picture, the stickers that show you which direction to drive are outlined in white, but are reslly just see-through. the black shovel and push broom are cool. 

the car was great. i got this when i went to LEGOLand in February 2008 with a Pirate telescope (that actually worked as well as a prop) and Gavla (a blue shadow Matoran from BIONICLE). I was not allowed to build the Service Station beacause of the fact that we would have to fly back all the way to Cincinatti (however you spell that)airport. But I did build Gavla (who can fit inside her canister if you break her) and, yeah you probably guessed, the car and motorcycle. The windshield on the car is rare, at least to me. Motorcycle was great.

The Octan worker was pretty cool. Dark blue legs would not have gone wrong, though. Motorcycle driver and car drivers are cool. 

Overall a great and totally awesome set. (the small baseplate in the back does not make it that hard to put into your city)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2010-01-13T08:41:40.843Z","Simply beautiful!","I got this set used, along with many other sets, it came completely dissasembled in a plastic bag. It had been owned and played with by a child, and as such, it is, unfortunatly, missing a few pieces. Nothing on the station itself is missing, but one minifig is gone (the driver for the car), and the car itself is missing i few pieces. So, i suspect that the car has been in play, a lot!, and that maybe, it has endured more than it's share of crashes! :) Oh how wonderful it was, being a child, and smashing ones lego cars into everything in sight, hehe. I can rebuild the car easily, but the missing minifig is bothering me a bit. Oh well, for the price i payed, i'm just happy that the station itself is complete. :) And really, other than the few missin parts, the whole thing is en excellent condition, so i'm very happy with it.

Now for the review. This set is perhaps, the most beautiful service station ever created by lego, i am very very pleased by the design of it, it looks just gorgeous with the glass sealing on the pump section, and the car wash, and the big glass windows also on the car wash. I think it gives it a sleek, modern look, so it's just great! For it's size, it's a fairly easy build, and when built, the whole thing is actually very sturdy. One detail that i personely liked, was that the base plate was molded, out of a soft plastic material, instead of the hard ones, that break way to easy. This is more flexible, but that also means you have to be careful when moving it.

Here's a few funny detailes with the set. The turbines on the car wash can be turned every wich way you prefer, the washers in the car wash has a rubber band, so that when you drive a car through them, they are pushing in on the car, great detail, but be advised that the car wash is ""one way only"". It will break if you drive the wrong way through it without first pushing the washers to the side so the car can get through. The wrong way, being the one shown on the picture, hehe. Finally, the little soda vending machine, actually has little sodas.

theres really only one thing i don't like about the set, and that is, that the little shop has no items in it. There's just a cash register. I think it could have come with some items to.

It comes with 3 minifigs, i only own two of them, but the two i have, are great, it comes with a pretty basic, yellow car, and a black motorcycle. I don't really care for the new type of motorcycle, but it's okay. The car i really like, it's very simillar in design to the 7236 police car, but there are a few key differences. It also comes with various assortments af brooms, brush, etc.

One thing i will note is that some of the bigger trucks won't fit through it, at least not without some help, for example the  7686 helicopter transport, wich is to high with the copter, and to wide with the sideview mirrors. To bad, trucks need fuel to, you know.

For those who complain about it not fitting into a base-plate only city layout, that might be true, but what i would do, and what i will do when i eventually have the sets, and the room to build my own little town, is build the town on plywood, and then just paint the entrance, and the exit to the station, directly on the plywood, or maybe on a thin plastic sheet, so it can be moved if the city layout changes. The car wash sticking out can be fixed easy by just adding a piece of base plate the correct size. These are not big problems, at least not in my opinion.

Anyway, i simply love this set, so, top 5/5 from me, you should find this set if you can. Goes great with the 8402 sports car to. :)
