The truck works well to transport the containers. The mechanics of the crane work very good the boom moves to change how the hook drops.

"chuofred","2007-05-26T15:08:42.26Z","A Solid Addition to any Lego City","About time we got a cargo bay/harbor to incorporate into our Lego City!  

It is sets like this that makes Lego building such a wonderful experience.  First of all, it doesn’t take a Lego expert to realize the complexity and the thought process that goes into the development of this model.  The construction techniques and the amazing details successfully demonstrate the ingenuity of Lego building and connector concepts, one can easily appreciate the design of the ship’s engine room, the anchoring component for the truck’s front panel, and the smooth motion of the crane’s operating mechanics.  

The second aspect that I like is the amount of colors in this model; I counted at least ten different colors.  They are integrated so well, they make the application of stickers almost obsolete.

In my opinion, this set is very well put together.

As of now, I have combined 3 harbor sets and I am planning to purchase more harbor plates to extend these piers further.  I am also on the lookout for any black, white, and blue cargo walls.  

Finally, I recommend purchasing the Container Stacker (7992) and the Garbage Truck (7991) as additions to this model, adding both color and cargo containers to make a bigger and more vibrant scenery.  

I thank you for taking your time to read over my review, and I hope that it has been informative.

"noblesavage","2007-07-05T23:53:23.827Z","Outstanding!","I got past the sticker shock as soon as I opened the box... what a boat! This massive vessel can carry not only it's cargo but ALL of the cargo in my city. And its not just the &quot;big&quot; that impessed me but also the detail: recessed compartments, engine room, duel radar, smoke stack, running lights. The bridge takes me back to classic town and is punctuated by inverted sloped windows- very nice.

The crane is magnificent. In addition to a winch, the crane arm articlates up/down for precise cargo placement. 

NOTE to builders: I think the string box was hidden in bag #5. Take care not to use all of it on the winch (like I did... directions not withstanding), because you will need some for the anchor and fishing pole too!

"Beren","2007-07-04T07:51:40.217Z","A Wonderful Set","As others have said, this set is a must buy for any Lego City enthusiast. The attention to detail and the build is just wonderful. The new trucks (one in this set and 7990 and 7991) are my favourite Lego vehicles of all time.

The ship is huge and the crane is completely functional. The detail on the bridge of the ship and the engine room are wonderful. Other details like the man fishing, the warning sign with the car falling into the water, the computer in the booth and so on are all great credit to the current Lego team - they are superb at the moment with Lego City.

The Container Stacker (7992) is a good addition. This is my least favourite of this series but is still very good and does add more containers. However, it is too wide to use on the pier.

"jd5775","2007-07-19T20:37:39.48Z","Mixed Feelings","Hi, this is my set review for 7994 Lego City Harbor.

Let me start by saying that I believe this set is inferior to 6541 and 6542, although it is a step above the junior town from a couple of years ago.

Pros:
-Really large boat
-Nice crane
-Good source of pier pieces
-Nice cabin and inverted windows

Cons 
-Completely blown out of the water by 6541 and 6542
-Boat is almost too large for harbor
-New style containers are odd
-Truck is too short
-Slight juniorization and blockier feel

Overall this set is an average three.  At least lego is trying to avoid juniorization and return to normal.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Exo_brick","2007-12-29T20:17:52.56Z","Look!","I love this set! Well I'm going to point something out for you. There is a mounting on the bottom of the ships hull for a boat motor! My friend owns this set and I own a boat motor and it is Extremely slow!  
I personally think it is more of novelty. All of the parts of this
set go together very well. Over and out Exo-brick!    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickzone","2007-11-26T11:01:36.843Z","City theme's ship comes in","The single biggest point of note for this set is, well, that it's big! That's to some extent obvious from the stock photo and box art, but really, neither prepare you for the massive ship hull coming out of the box, or the harbour plates taking form as you build them and wonder just how much space it will take up (lots).

Starting with the basics: I really like the new harbour plates. Unlike the old ones, these are essentially &quot;brick built&quot; despite the main component being flat plates or huge &quot;road&quot; plates with kerbs either side. I think these are more useful &quot;special bits&quot; than the old thick harbour plates.

I'll be honest, I bought this on sale, and I'm not sure it's worth full price. A lot of the cost is for a few large parts, and while although they are cool, they aren't necessarily worth it. That said, the containers for example, though simple with large panel pieces, do look the part. Even the stickers are nice and liven things up, you'll find them perfectly fine for custom models (e.g. the barriers, cargo panels).

The models are nicely done for the most part:

*The crane is simply superb due to the technic mechanism; when complete, you only need turn two knobs to control the raising/lowering and the extension/retraction of the crane. The colours are nice bright well-matched ones too.

*The truck is relatively straightforward and its merits are just from the general 6-wide vehicle style with front plate that looks the business. I don't understand why it has no back window.

*The ship is again, pretty simple for the most part (really there's little building for the most of it, just a few bits attached to the massive hull). That said, the details on the cab at the back are nicely done as others have mentioned. The engine room looks like it has an engine, although a pity there's no proper hatch into it. The control room has a nice computer and the cool window, and easy roof opening for play. I love the simple touches to portray comms apparatus on the roof.

*The harbour office is barely a room, but it does look the part all the same on the pier, and has a computer station. The barriers and accessories on the pier are also nice - life preserver, warning sign, trolley, fishing line.

All in all, this set really does &quot;look the part&quot;, and you will be delighted to have all the parts if the cost is not an obstacle. If the RRP was a bit lower, I would have given 5 stars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"brickbuilder711","2007-11-04T01:20:47.42Z","WOW! A Great Return to the Seaport Line","First and foremost, I must say that these 2007 sets are a great comeback for LEGO city. The Harbor alone is just amazing. I expected smaller, but was first amazed at the boat size then the harbor itself. 

Let's take a tour at each submodel...

1. The Truck
The truck was a simple and quick build, and continues to use LEGO's SNOT technique like most other vehicles. I was disappointed though that the bed was plain, they could have at least added a little detail like a pipe. 

2. The Boat
As I said, I was amazed at the monstrous size of this ship. Plus I like the detail. The cab was nicely designed and with Medium Blue motors.

3. The Containers
My favorite one is the boat. Nice little detail! The containers though are a little too simple though.

4. The Dock
I loved to do the office, and like the cans lining that area. The fishing pole is a nice touch too. The gates are nice but why the click hinges?

5. The Crane
One Word: Amazed. The technic techniques are cool, especially when you get closer to adding the crane arm. Too bad though that the crane is fixed in that position.

Overall, great comeback. I wasn't happy that only one large string was included, it is pretty hard to cut it.

Hopefully you enjoyed the review.

i went to a shop and saw this set for 49€, normal price is 79€, so i instantly bought it together with the container stacker 7992.

at home i was surprised how huge the ship was. but at first i built the container stacker. it was much fun and i was expecting to have even more when building the harbor.

and i wasnt disappointed. the building of the harbor, the crane, the truck and the ship was so much fun and took me more than an hour. pure fun and i love this set. it fits perfectly into my town.

nice little details like the fisherman and the small office make this set a full 5 out of 5 points.

"gvanrossum","2008-08-26T18:02:23.717Z","Crane Trouble","While I mostly agree with the raving reviews, I have on quibble with the playability of the crane.  My 6 year old son got this from his grandmother, and he couldn't wait until I had built it to play with it!  (It's the first Lego boat he's got that doesn't sink in his bathtub.)  However he was very disappointed by the crane's tendency to break -- the long Technic bar at the top that is supposed to hold it is constructed in a silly way, so that when you put any load on the crane, it pulls apart and the crane falls down -- and my boy is in tears!  Yes, I know it's not supposed to carry heavy loads, but tell that to a 6 year old...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Barack_Obama","2010-01-01T01:46:40.84Z","Great addition to your city. Could it be better?","Yes it could! This is indeed a fantastic set. Many people have concentrated on the positives of this set and there truly are many. This can be gathered just by looking at the picture. So I will just mention a few things which for me made this a 4 and not a 5. 

The ship: To be honest, there isn't much wrong with the ship. It is huge, which is great. However perhaps two more containers would have been a good addition. This wouldn't have cost lego that much extra as the containers are hollow. Speaking of the containers...

The containers: The new 6 wide containers are weird. Naturally real world containers are quite rectangular in shape. The old 4 wide containers were much more reminiscent of their real life counter parts, than the new ones. But that's not all! The older containers used to stack on top of each other much more securely. The new ones stack rather loosely. Lets head to the pier now:

The Pier: Sadly it looks as though Lego no longer has the molds for there old dock plates as used in the previous harbors. The new ones make this look more like a small town pier, rather than a large city harbor dock. Having said that, it's a lot bigger and it would certainly have taken quite a few of the old plates to get it to this length, so it's not all bad news.

The crane: Looks wise it's great. I haven't yet experienced a problem with it's weakness, but I can definitely see a design error. The top spar is constructed in a strange way which doesn't seem to support heavy loads. This is not a problem when the set is new, but I can imagine with a little wear, this might become quite a nuisance.

The truck: Now this is the one thing in this set, that I genuinely dislike. There is a certain feeling around this 'vehicle', that tells me that Lego just designed it quick and easy, because they had to throw a truck in this set. As a now standard 6 wide truck, it looks rather short and square. Personally I think they should have made it a trailer truck with the capacity for 2 containers. Then it would have looked normal.

The office: Not bad, I quite like it. Yes it could have been better, but it works just as well in this size. I quite like the PC inside it with it's flat screen. 

I hope you don't see this as a negative review. This really is a 'must have' set. 
Go and get it!

"Krogh","2010-01-29T13:18:10.28Z","Bigger is better!","Okay, so once again i have gone and spent waaaay to much money on this ""little"" hobby of mine, but it's really alright, i got a bunch of big sets for a great deal at a private seller, and almost all of them were new in sealed boxes, i guess i saved about 400USD, if not more, by not bying them in stores.

So, as you might already have guessed, this set is one of the new sets i picked up, and so, let us take a look at the Lego city harbour.

Now, the first thing i thought when i opened the box, and the bags spilled out on the table, was, WOW, that ship is huuuuge!. I new it would be big, but big is an understatement. The only other city/town ship that i own, not counting small speedboats and other small sets, is the old 4010 police rescue boat, wich is not big at all. Since i, as of yet, do not own any other ships, this is my only comparison in size, so to me, this cargo ship is truely BIG! And i like it! It is not only big, but actually fairly realistic in it's design, of course the bridge and engine room is not quite in scale, but it's okay, the ship is by far the best thing about this set! Oh and the best feature of the ship is that it floats! :) My only complaint about the ship is, that it does not come with the electric motor to fit underneath. But, since i already have one, it is not a big deal for me.

On to the container truck, it is a good addition, but it's not very well realised. Tha cabin is open in the back, and the frame is not good at all. It also has those way to small side mirrors that i hate so very much. There is barely any detail on it, and it just feels like it's missing a lot. But it's there, and i guess it is better than nothing. :)

The harbour consists of 3 parts, the crane, the on/off ramp with the small office, and the docks them selves. I have no major complaints with any of it, although the office is a bit small, compared to the massive scale of the set in generel, and the docks are.. well, they are docks. The crane is also great! It will turn 360 degrees, the crane arm will move up and down, and ofcourse the wench is fully functional. A great addition to the harbour.

The set comes with 4 containers, one of wich is really just a base plate, that holds a few gas cans, and one of wich is an open container, holding a very small speedboat, this is a nice little detail. The last 2 are ordinary closed containers. I normally keep one of the closed containers on the truck at all times, since it looks really stupid without it.
Now i've noticed that some reviewers complain that there are not enough containers, if you feel that is the case, i would recommend picking up the 7992 ""container stacker"". That will give you 2 more containers, and the stacker itself also fits nicely into the harbour scene, although it might be a bit to big.

Finally the set comes with 5 minifigs, all very nice, and all but one fairly standart. The exception is the  ships captain, i can't remember having seen him before, allthough since i do not have much experience with whips, it might just be me. In any case, i really like him. :)

I would recommend this set to most anyone, but be aware that it's i BIG set, so it will take up a lot of space in your city!

4/5, only because i am not completely satisfied with the truck. Well, maybe also partly because there are waaay to many stickers.
