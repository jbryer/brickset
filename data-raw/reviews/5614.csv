"bsmarthen","2007-06-03T14:31:51.293Z","Love this set!!!","I ordered this set off s@h, then the next day toysrus had it. It was  hard not to buy it, It look ed so great.I just had to wait till the one I ordered got here. 

The build was pretty easy. When it was done the truck looks great. Its big alone or with the trailer. The cab is built going in so many directions no just up. The colors are great, The top of the truck uses a hood for a air spoiler. The dump mechanics work well and will hold dump bucket up. 

This is a great set but you need alot of room for it. But it is well worth the 35 to 40 dollars. Highly recomended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-07-31T11:54:54.63Z","A true Inspiration","Another toy sale bargain. Been eyeing this up for months and finally caught one in a toy sale for 29.99 AU. Totally stoked. Another great colour scheme considering its green, the white grey green just works. Its big, like 8 studs wide big, it looks like a truck should, bigger than the car and bigger than a small truck or van.

The fact that they didn't stop at one but turned it into a double with a dolly in the middle is just awesome and if u really wanted with slight modification could become a triple.

Duel cab with bunk bed is just cool. it even has a gear stick. i know, omg! The fully working rams on the tilts really impressed me and they dump quite well actually. 

The best part of this model is the fact that my mate who was here the night i built it said it looked quite realistic towards the trucks we have here and was quite impressed of the quality of detail from a LEGO model. Air lines, Front grill, spottys air horns, the works on the roof.

Two small annoyances. Firstly, the wheels are on pins, no axles, a little cheap and unprofessional in my opinion. I mean come on did we just pay $3.99 or $39.99 (In places).

Secondly, another Mini-Fig would have been nice for the size of the set.

Overall I'm giving this one a 9/10. Would have been 10 but those flimsy wheels on pins really grinds me. Still a great set and would seriously recommend to a collector, a parts hunter or a player as this model has it for all.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"benners30","2007-10-28T14:35:45.153Z","great set awesome!","they were havin a sale at our local costco where a whole bunch of city sets were all 33.00 each!(canadian) i quickly scooped it up and am gonna go back for lots of other sets. quickly i dug into the packages and began building. when i was done, it looked amazing. and it worked amazingly too. it was so detailed. it had storage lockers for the chocks, a bed, seating for two without touching arms! a speed gear and a lttle lever( i forget what theyre called). oh and to top it off, they added another trailer! how many set have that? the fig is basically the same as the garbage truck guy with some different clothes.plus the truck beds are raised by pistons! how realalistic is that? great set glad i found it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2007-12-22T13:24:15.733Z","Very Nice Town Essential","I like the diversity of CITY lines LEGO made in 2007. This is a great set to run on the highways, though it is a little too wide. I like every last detail included as well as the sleeper cab. However, the tippers are one piece and the flexibility isn't that great in my books. Let's go submodel by submodel:

1. The Cab:
Amazing cab included, every detail is very nice. The SNOT continues to be terrific and the 4x6 wedge plate is a nice touch. The mirrors make a nice detail. Perfect cab.

2. First trailer:
The drawers are a nice touch. The techniques and the lift of the tipper bucket are excellent. Only flaw is that the trailer could be separate.

3. Second Trailer:
Again nice like the second submodel, with the SNOT and the technic pieces. No problems except for the bucket.

Overall this is a great set for the City line. Thanks for taking the time to read my review.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"adik_sa_lego","2008-01-19T18:15:49.687Z","how lego should be","for the most part, this is how lego should be: technic on the inside, lego bricks on the outside. i'm an 8-wide truck fan since it's more mini-fig scale than the classic 4-wide trucks before.

this set is huge! it's moddable so that it can become a truck pulling 2 trailers instead of a dump truck pulling 1. still experimenting how other people did it.

the front SNOT plate is menacing and makes the truck really macho. it's the best non-ferrari truck i have and it's a bargain considering the price and the huge box.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jim2301","2011-02-17T07:55:18.13Z","Great set, 'loads' (ahem) of possibilities!","&nbsp;I bought this set for my son not long after it came out and was quite surprised as to how complex it was for a City model. Don't let that retract from the model as it is a really good set. There's a good mix of parts and the large green skips can carry quite a lot of LEGO rubble/scrap. Nicely done is the bogey system between the tractor and the trailer. Also, not long after we bought the set, my son received a duplicate set for Christmas, providing the opportunity to create a LEGO ""road train"", which is awesome, you should try it. All in all a good set with a lot of possibilities.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"sikennedy","2008-05-21T19:08:29.34Z","just too big","Again like other new city models its great as a standalone and i love the scale of it, but seriously it cant turn a corner on a roadplate and as part of a city layout, it is just too big! The cab is a piece of class though, there are loads of great wee touches, mirrors, snot, sleeper space and just looks like a proper truck! A great front cab to a nearly great set. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T22:41:42.187Z","Finally, a dump truck of just the right size","At last, LEGO finally released a dump truck of the perfect size, unlike the giant yellow one. This set comes with neat features like a sleeping area in the truck, dashboard, transmission lever, tire stoppers, green buckets with tipping action, trailer and cup. Like any other set, it also comes with a minifig. Everything works perfectly, except the fact that the side compartment doors come off when you close it. Also, the truck has to take up an entire road in order to make a sharp turn. But that's not important. Overall, the price is reasonable and the set is decent.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rad","2009-03-13T05:09:10.2Z","Awesome size!","I finally managed to track down this set and was glad I did!

The width and length is awesome, it truly is a hauler. The tippers function and hold place well. The cab is nice and big and the front is detailed.

No real downsides for me with this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"pod120","2009-04-25T19:58:07.84Z","Even More Heavy Duty!!","When I first saw this set I was not interested in getting it. Anyway I received it as a Christmas present from my Grandparents in 2007 and I was happy I did. I think the truck is a cool novelty to Lego City, and it was one of the first green vehicles.

Pros
-Hydraulic Tipping Function works well
-Wheel Blocks are a good addition to the set
-A good visual design, green and white compliment each other
-Detailed Interior Cabin (houses driver and passenger, includes a Bed)
-Vehicles 4 studs wide fit very well into Tipping Bucket
-Includes a cup for the driver
-Long...........very long

Cons
-Set has stickers
-Horizontal, flat Rods between wheels easily fall off
-Set could have included some more equipment or something to put in Tipper Bucket

"blocktron","2009-04-30T18:32:48.077Z","Versatile addition to any construction site.","I picked this set up a few months back but only really started to look at it now. A simple enough set build wise (lets face it the tipper is all one piece) but the truck body is suitable for use in any artic lorry that you may have in your plans and getting 2 tippers means you can easily split the set and get 2 for the price of 1 as it were.

On a side note, I've never come across a tipper truck with tipping trailer too, surely if you were to tip out the tipper closest to the truck cab you'd end up trapping the rear trailer?

Rating:
+2 Tipper trailers are definitely worth the cost alone for adding to construction site models.
+1 Build was easy - if that's what you're looking for.
+1 Nice details - Wheel stops, Cab, side storage lockers.
+1 Cab - Best minifig scale cab for a while, sleeping quarters et al.

-1 As a stand alone model the rear trailer looks a bit flimsy, not robust enough for a construction site.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-11-01T10:49:13.84Z","Lego Landtran…","This was pretty much the same deal as the other drawbar set (7733), I saw this in an older Lego catalogue and started looking for it straight away, in the usual places but I failed to find it so again turned to eBay and there was a new one in sealed box for £15.99, for that price I couldn’t resist.   It arrived a few days later and I couldn’t believe the size of the set, hence the title of the review, coined by a friend of mine ;o)   It really is massive and demands a lot of attention when it’s placed on display.   There have been issues discussed by previous reviewers regarding scale, and I agree to a point, but when you consider the size of these mammoth rigs compared with their drivers and other vehicles on the road such as cars, vans etc I think the scale is about right.   There is, I think, an issue when this ‘landtran’ is placed alongside another of the recent trucks, as they then seem too small!   Either way, this is a great set and probably my favourite truck Lego have released, I haven’t decided on where I am going to display mine, it is so long with the trailer attached I need a big surface!

The set comes in a huge box; three individual bags of parts make up the set.   The driver minifig has blue overalls and a kind of cheesy grin!   He also has a baseball cap on.   

The first task is to build the long chassis which will form the tractive vehicle; this is a three axle design made up of various technic rods which are coupled together with more technic pins and standard plates.   There is a rear light board and number plate along with the drawbar coupling itself.   Various tanks and storage lockers are attached to the sides of the chassis.

The second task is to build the cab and upper sections.   The cab is a great little sub-assembly and is built using the base plate onto which the rest of the cab is constructed.   The cab seats two minifigs (just one is supplied with the set) on red seats, as well as a gear lever and a plate which depicts various dials and gauges.   Just to the rear of and above the seats is the sleeper cab with bunk.   There are two individual windscreen panels provided (the truck is eight studs wide excluding wing mirrors) as well as amber marker lights and a visor over the windscreen.   The roof of the cab is decorated with two small antennae, air horns, fully adjustable twin spotlights and a wind deflector which is in the raked back position.   The huge grill features vents, spotlights, indicator lights, low-level fog lights and bumper with number plate detail.   Nudging up to the rear of the cab are what appears to be two vertical exhausts.   Behind this is the tipper unit, this is attached to the chassis of the truck by way of various Technic axles and fasteners.   A further Technic rod allows the tipper unit to be ‘raised’ and ‘lowered’ as and when required.

The third and final task is to construct the trailer tipper unit which will couple up via the drawbar to the tractive vehicle.   Again, the chassis is constructed by way of various Technic rods and plates as mentioned on the main unit.   A rear light board with number plate is also supplied as are a steerable haul axle at the front end and one fixed axle towards the rear of the trailer.   The tipper unit is once more attached using the various Technic axles and fasteners.   A further Technic rod allows the tipper unit to be ‘raised’ and ‘lowered’ as and when required as with the main unit.

A pair of bright yellow ‘chocks’ are also provided; these can be stored in the under-cab lockers when not in use.   There are various graphics (stickers) which need to be applied, these are very discreet and don’t detract from the ‘adult’ theme of the set.

In summary, it’s great, a really pleasing set which is great as a stand-alone display piece, it will dominate any City scene, but I doubt it will be able to navigate the Lego City road plates, and it won’t fit into the garage (7642), let’s hope it doesn’t break down…",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
