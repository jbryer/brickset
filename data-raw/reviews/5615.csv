"jamal_lts","2008-09-09T03:21:10.747Z","Find the ENZO","intial stage of construction was interesting... it was different then the enzo... but as i was finishing it... i realise the enzo was a much better looking model. 

The build sequence for the fiorano is built the front, built the back.. then combine the two , then fix everything else ... whereas the enzo was building everything starting from the bottom layer to the top.

However.. when it comes to the seat, the khaki color is really a nice touch.

My plus point for this model is the engine compartment t the front... has loads of space for some serious mods.. ie. adding a motor for remote function!!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Time4TT","2008-12-22T02:44:53.39Z","7th large Lego car - another Ferrari!","This model follows on in the tradition of Lego building large car models (853, 8860, 8865, 8880, 8448, 8653). I'm not so sure about the looks of this model, but carries on Lego's recent strategy of releasing large cars based on famous cars with essentially the same structure underneath them (steering, suspension, engine, no gearbox, rear wheel drive). Not really pushing the envelope technically, but producing a car which will hopefully appeal to kids and adult collectors alike. The short lifespan of this model (discontinued in 2008) seems to show this one didn't live up to expectations.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Monty","2009-08-10T07:46:40.593Z","Stickers are now peeling off!","Another model spoilt because carefully applied stickers are now peeling off going brittle and disintegrating after just over 2 years! Luckily there are not many on this set. 

As i have said before, i for one would ask Lego to use printing rather than stickers - certianly on the expensive sets which are primarily for display.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"janverdijsseldonk","2010-01-29T07:33:17.297Z","Best looking Ferrari set","This was my first Lego Ferrari set (afterwards I bought the Enzo) and I can say that this set looks absolutely great. It has a real cognac colored Ferrari interior, nice looking head- and taillights and a massive V12 engine block.
From a technical view this set is really exciting; it doesn't have suspension, a gearbox or any of that, only the doors and the trunk can be opened but it's not very spectacular.
Overall this car is a real show car and you must not expect a technically complicated model from a Lego Racers series. The car does what it's meant for and that is looking great!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
