"Tilius","2006-09-30T16:02:33Z","Does not include instructions for the three individual models!!!","This set is good, and includes the PARTS for Brutaka, Axonn and Vezon/Fenrakk, however it only has instructions for the main model. The Kardas itself is big, and has clever extendable wings. The tain is also cleverly made. The main problem is the use of big Piraka torsos for the main bulk of the set, making it seem a big juniorized, with the blue, red and yellow colors. More black and silver would have been welcome.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"DarkLordMakuta","2007-07-23T22:47:20.383Z","HOLY COW, IT'S HUGE!","I only built the Kardas from instructions that were scanned online, so it took me about 3 hours to build, but it was 3 hours well spent, because this dragon is COOL! I just don't like the fact that there's no way to set Vezon on him, and his chain is too short (something which is easily remedied). Overall a cool set, and if you can find the official set, buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"freakish1987","2007-11-07T12:26:30.327Z","Vezon and godzilla!","This set is HUGE! My original intention of buying this set is for axonn, brutaka, and vezon/fenrakk. but after finished building kardas/vezon, I fell in love with it. I recommend you to buy it if you are considering. If you don't have this set, this set should be your next target.

Pros:
670 pieces for SGD69.60! :)
vezon has a nice shield
kardas is very dragon-like
both models are easy to pose
hours of fun building

Cons:
Kardas has a bit too much different colours,
it's tail's end cannot stand because it is a bit long

Overall:
It is a must buy set. You won't regret it. :)

"Dragon_fire","2008-04-03T14:19:00.31Z","A truly cool set","This set is brilliant, it has many good pieces, it has a good solid build and excellent movement in most joints. it does have quite thin arms and his neck is a bit flimsy but all in all, kardas is very good.
Now for vezon, his spear is a bit simple but his shield is great. one complaint however, his body swings a bit, this is due to his body being taller than in vezon and fenrakk.
you can get instructions for the three models that make up vezon and kardas but they aren't included in the set. you have to download them off lego",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"irnakk4431","2008-12-18T17:44:58.747Z","great buy!","this is my first review. i got this set last year and it is massive!
this is the tallest bionicle ever and the third most pieces of any bionicle.
this is my alltime favourite set. if your a bionicle collector and have not got this set yet,
then i would consider buying this set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kiiranaux","2011-01-22T20:41:27.863Z","Rampage in the city or combat pathetic Toa!","Even as one who no longer collects Bionicles, I still greatly appreciate the Kardas set. Essentially it is what the box art shows: a truly massive dragon, which can also form Axonn and Brutaka (but why would you?)<br>This was one of my favorite bionicle builds ever, challenging, long and rewarding.<br>The amount of parts you gained was worthwhile for the price, though they were mostly generic technic and bionicle parts besides the dragon head and wings.<br><br>One of the greatest pros of the set is its sheer size. No matter where you put it, it looks impressive standing tall and dwarfing other bionicles and mechs from various lego themes.<br><br>Also, it can stand on its own, but this can be very difficult unless it is on carpet or something else with a lot of friction. That is the main drawback to the set - it is playable when you are holding it, and displayable if you find a balance ""sweet spot,"" but it gets annoying to find a balance point if you move it multiple times in a row.<br><br>Overall, an excellent set.<br>",TRUE,4,2,5,4,5
"pig","2009-12-11T12:22:27.56Z","Epic Bionicle set","Parts: 
Vezon&Kardas's parts are same than Axonn's, Brutaka's and Vezon&Fenrakk's, but instructions for other models are not included. Parts give great start for Bionicle building, thought there are also some very unuseable and juniorized parts like ugly Piraka Torsos. They still work well in Kardas. Amout of useful limb pieces is nice, including Vahki legs, Piraka legs, Rahkshi legs and Metrutoran legs. There is also many feet, some weapons, some armours and some small, but extremely useful TECHNIC parts, including six lovely ball joint with axle holes. Many Bohrok eyes are nice too. 9.5/10

Desing:
Vezon is nearbly same than one from Vezon&Fenrakk. Only differences are arms. Armour is bit different and other arm has shield instead. Fusion Staff isn't as cool as before, but it's just a minor con.
Kardas, in his case, is awesome. He's big, sturdy, quite poseable and has some interesting tehcniques. Jaws snaps, wings can be spread and Vezon can ride his favourite dragon. Even toes are poseable. Kardas looks very good on a shelf. 9.5/10

Building:
Building 10204 is mainly easy and fun, but Kardas's head is difficult. I suppose that there is error in instruction manual, because some pins doesn't fit insede the skull like manual says. It can be done in another way, so it really isn´t so bad thing.
Vezon has still pretty boring body build. 9/10

Playability:
Vezon is basic action figure with 12 points of articulation. Fun to play with. Kardas may be even too big for fast play, but he's sturdy. Kardas is fun to put different poses, so it's funny overall. Kids will love this set. 9/10

Price:
Price of 10204 is about 50€, so brick-per-part ratio is pretty good. For example, Axonn and Brutaka both cost 25€ and Vezon&Fenrakk costs about 40€. That's 90€, so 50€ is nearbly 50% off. Very good price, really worth of it.
10/10

Final points: 4.7/5. So it have deserved five out of five.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
