"Novelty","2007-05-07T11:48:19.543Z","Flim Flam alakazam!","The contents of this set: a wizard, his glow in the dark wand, a grey parrot, a treasure chest, 2 wheels and some assorted pieces that makes the cart.  This set is great if one is looking for an army of wizards, or a large collection of wands, grey parrots or treasure chest, because it is so small it is economically to purchase quite a large quantity of it.  On its own there isn't really any redeption - why would a wizard want to hand carry a cart when he could presumably fly or teleport?",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

I'll make the review of this wizard again, with few details more. This set is small and have to be compared with small ones, like with the new impulse. This set is basically a wizard with blue parts, a grey bird and a cart with a treasure chest. 

This set is useful altough have few contents, and the details of the wizard are imaginative. The parts of the wizard can be used in any minifigure to make this looks like with a wizard. This don't looks like very with gandalf like the new wizard from impulse sets because this have blue details and have a wand with a star at the top. The face of the wizard is the same of the original lego minifigure, but this now is very rare with the new different heads and faces, so this is great currently, few sets have this face in this time. The gray parrot don't moves, like the owl of the new wizard, but have differences with this and is useful too also to themes like pirates (in the pirates theme, parrots were colorful, but this still useful). 

The cart have common wheels in the brown color, and with a special plate to put them, under a black plate, where are placed another type of plate (this in blue color) where can be putted the parrot or the wand. In the black plate also are placed the treasure chest and too another little plate (this in gray) in the front to the wizard carry the cart. Simple building, cool result, useful few contents, what makes this small set a great small set. 

If you think that the wizard hadn't to carry the cart, it don't justify to make you don't buy it or put a bad rate on this, is easy pick other figure to make this work, or also dismantle the cart to make another thing with the few but useful contents. Well, this set is a 4,8/5 to small sets, and worth if bought by the price of an impulse or more cheap. This in the boxed version shows on the back of the small box another types of building, and is easy to do them. By that, this is great as a small set, and don't deserves bad rates. This Wizard as the name of the set shows, have a name, but it isn't necessary, altough this name is better than names like &quot;Good Wizard&quot;, but names and storyline aren't important, the owner of the set can put names on them, don't using the original names or storyline, don't depending of factions for characters or those things.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It seems this set came in multiple packages.  I am not 100% sure witch one I got but I do know I have one of them.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
