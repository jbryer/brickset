"Gus_263","2008-03-28T13:40:32.2Z","Small set, good pieces and building","This set is one of the small sets of the pirates theme and is like some other small sets of this theme, have few pieces, but all have a great value to increase bigger sets. This includes a pirate minifigure, different of some released early, but stay in the lego classic style, in a simple design like other minifigures of the pirates theme. This includes a hat, a sword and a pistol. The little scenery is a group of some gray few pieces, thatmakes it looks like stones and in the side there is a green leaf in a good size to it. Under these things are a small plate. The treasure chest with the treasure inside, is included and it stay inside the &quot;stones&quot;, if you push the piece above the leaf,you will find this little entrance, that is a nice thing in building for this small set. Altough it have few playability, pieces and innovations, the set must have comparison with other small, so,this is good builted and haveuseful pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"bricksan","2012-06-05T09:17:20.62Z","1747 Treasure Surprise","<div>Time for the first review of June, with me focusing on the 1996 Pirate set in our Featurette, I thought it would be only fitting to review on of the sets from this era.</div><div><br></div><div>I never owned any of these the first time round, having entered my dark age two years earlier. So this set was all new to me when I bought it last November of eBay for £3.09 plus P&amp;P. The set I purchased was in near mint condition and was nice to build a model from the 90's that was like new.</div><div><br></div><h4>Introduction</h4><div><br></div><div>The set was the smallest of the year and there was also a polybag version of the same set. &nbsp;At the time of release the set would have cost you around £1.99 here in the UK and was a pocket money set. I have reviewed quiet a few pocket money sets, from the really good ones like Buried Treasure to the not so good like Shipwrecked Pirate.</div><div><br></div><div>This set came with 22 pieces , take off the the minifigure elements, coins and goblet, you are left with 13 pieces to build your model. The minifigure was new for 1996 and looks to be a revamped version of the first mate. I do like this minifigure, with the grey beard and blue coat and as it only appeared over a 2 year period is not an over used minifigure, unlike the earlier pirate minifigures.</div><div><br></div><h4>The Build</h4><div><br></div><div>The instructions for the build is an A5 piece of paper with the cover art, minifigure build and the first 6 steps of the main build on the front and &nbsp;thee last 3 on the back, as well as set advertising at the bottom. The actual set is on of the smallest as it is on a 4 by 4 stud yellow plate, with the first 6 stages spent building up the rock area on the plate where the treasure is hidden. I think it would have been better on a large plate so the mini figure has some where to stand.</div><div><br></div><div>As you turn the instructions over you add the brick flap, treasure and palm leaf to finish the build off. For a small set it is a fun on to build and out of the ones I have reviewed so far, it is by far the most complicated. &nbsp;On the back of the box you have tow extra builds one is the Pirate sleeping under the rocks with the palm leaf giving him shade, the other is a throne for him to sit upon.</div><div><br></div><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><div><br></div><div>As I mention above, out of those sets I have reviewed so far, this is the most complicated. Obviously you can’t compare it to a larger set build but for a pocket money set, it is fun to build. I also like building the extra ideas on the back of the box. My only main grumble is the yellow 4×4 plate should have been bigger so the minifigure could stand on it.</div><div><br></div><div>The yellow goblet and coins are always welcomed, although not the biggest fan of sets from 1996, this has really grown on me and one I recommend getting if you are a pirate fan. You can pick up a decent 2nd hand one for around £5 if you shop around for it.</div><div><br></div><div>Review on my site:&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/1747-treasure-surprise/"">http://brickfanatics.co.uk/Reviews-detail/1747-treasure-surprise/</a></div><div>Link to images:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629995315255/with/7156123385/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/65553751@N03/sets/72157629995315255/with/7156123385/</a></div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
"James83","2021-07-10T10:48:04.637Z","Hidden Treasure","<p>This was one of the last Pirate sets that I brought and it caught my eye as a useful addition to my collection.</p>

<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>

<p>This is a very small pocket money set and is&nbsp;easy to build, probably a 5-minute job at most. It is&nbsp;a simple design, the yellow base represents a sandy beach while the grey bricks form a rock, which has become a hidden stash for pirated treasure. A hinged grey 2x2 flat brick forms the door. There are some neat features, the inside of the cave has flat bricks on the floor which makes stowing the coins inside very easy and the palm leaf adds some camouflage. I do have one minor criticism&nbsp;however;&nbsp;the space inside is very small which makes it hard to&nbsp;fit the goblet inside and with it inside the door doesn&#39;t close&nbsp;flush (which defeats the object of a secret hideaway).</p>

<p>The set comes with four gold coins and a yellow goblet, which makes this set worth getting for these alone (plus grey bricks in those days were not common).</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>One pirate with a nicely detailed printed torso with a blue coat and brown shirt, black legs, grey bearded face and a black felt hat. He comes armed with a cutlass and a flintlock pistol.</p>

<p>When I purchased this set it was the figure that drew my attention, being somewhat different from the older pirate minfigures who seemed to often have striped jerseys and an&nbsp;eyepatch.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>To be honest this set got broken down fairly quickly having purchased it for the figure and the treasure. But its unique figure and the additional loot&nbsp;are the main selling points, plus it provides enough playable fun as an addition to a larger pirate scene combined with other sets.</p>
