Altogether, a very well put together set, and I like the minifig, because he can be used as a diver if you are short on them.                                                                                                                                  deluckybrick",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-14T02:22:25.787Z","The Littlest Aquazone","This particular model was a lucky one. I came across it one day in a Coles supermarket with a few different others and spent the next five weeks collecting them all. This one i never saw in normal toy stores. Its an awesome little set. The first thing i noticed was he didn't have the standard blue Aquanauts mask but a black one. Also his face isn't standard Aquanauts its cooler and he is wearing sun glasses. Comes with the usual flippers and knives but can be for the mini-fig while off the Paravane or equipped to the Paravane for defence and steering while on it. 

The best part of this model is the control panel. It's printed on. No dodgy sticker so an A++ from me there and the mini-fig also doubles as a diver if you need another.

No real flaws to this little cutie but maybe an animal or two sets of knives and flippers but i guess that adds the the fun and size of the model. I remember these costing like $3.99 AU which is quite expensive even today but was well worth it.

Overall for a little set this is quite a good one and has good playability for its size. I'm giving it a 7/10 because its just worth it. If you like sea, Aquazone or just like to collect little models this one is for you and offers alot of playability so get one if you are able.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-12T16:25:51.827Z","Small Aquanauts set","This is a cool small set of the subtheme Aquanauts, from the classic Aquazone theme. This little small set is like the other sets of this theme, an underwater vehicle, this consists in few pieces, due to it, i am reviewing this in comparision with other small sets. The minifigure have a cool dive equipment, also used in the other subthemes like hydronauts, and in this can be putted pieces on back. To the minifigure have also cool and useful itens like the flippers and the knives on the two sides of the vehicle. The colors of the vehicle don't combines much with the colors of the minifigure, but still cool, being yellow with black parts. The set keeps in feet don't dismounting by little plates, and these can keeps also the claw pieces where are putted the knives. A yellow ramp piece is in the center of the vehicle, and above it have a printed piece of control panel. This is a cool set to play with, altough small, have the itens that a diver minifigure needs, and makes this more playable. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zipper","2012-02-25T00:36:13.723Z","It's okay","This small set has it's place in the Aquanauts theme, but it's pretty much just a cheap way to get a minifig and some daggers. It would be pretty cool though to get an army of these. Other then that, what you see is what you get. A minifig, daggers, and a few basic pieces.",FALSE,3,2,2,3,4
"James83","2022-09-26T14:36:02.693Z","Cheap Underwater Fun","<p>Set 1749 Paravane (also known as Underwater Scooter) was a cheap pocket money set for&nbsp;the Aquanauts series within the Aquazone theme.</p>

<p><strong>The Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>With only nine bricks this is an easy build and is very sturdy. The vehicle itself is very basic but stylish with the yellow and black&nbsp;Aquanauts colour scheme. The use of angled bricks and the 2x3 slope brick give this a suitably streamlined look. The vehicle has a printed computer brick as a control panel and two clip bricks on which to store two knives. The base brick can be used to stow the Aquanaut&#39;s flippers. Other than that this vehicle has no frills&nbsp;and most confusingly has no means of propulsion! This is a strange omission when other small Aquazone sets like 6115 Shark Scout and the slightly later 6100 Aqua Dart both had propellers included.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minfig included is an Aquanaut 2 diver with printed torso and full diving gear including the cool diving suit with its integrated rear thruster and a black visor. Two knives and flippers are also included.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Developments</strong></p>

<p>I brought this set mainly for the figure. The lack of a means of propulsion was soon fixed by adding a pair of surplus Space rocket/jet bricks to serve as waterjets. It was a handy set to boost the Aquanaut&nbsp;gang that I had. Being a&nbsp;pocket money set you can&#39;t expect perfection and it offered cheap fun and fitted in well with the larger theme sets.&nbsp;</p>
