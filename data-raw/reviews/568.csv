These are two crossbows, a shield at the front of the set, two paddles and a helmet with the minifigure. The builting is easy due to the contents. Two small cone pieces where putted the crossbows keeps a space to put the minifigure, and this, hangigng two paddles keeps playable, and all the set. The minifigure have a face of the sheriff in the western theme, and this is another useful pieces. It have few pieces, but these are useful. Little black plates keeps the red ramp pieces to make the boat. This don't floats, but is cool to play with. Basci is the playability, but if with more contents, the builting and the playability can turns greater. Altough with few pieces and small p&#225;ckaged, this is playable, useful and in comparision with small packaged sets this deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is the most simple boat structure in the castle theme (in all lego themes 'cept ninja) but utterly efficient at such. I did not linger to go through my collection, ordering some boat parts, and assembeled four more of these. But since I only have one extra pair of oars, I had to settle for two complete set.

This lone oarsman has come to be one of my favourite heroes in my lego castle fantasies. He strikes at night silent and alone, comes undetected by sea/river and infiltrates the enemy stronghold. He then either opens a way for his heavily armoured knihgt buddies to deploy swift justice, or does the dirty job himself, neutralizing the enemy HQ or just assasinate the evil that lurks there.

The only thing that puzzles me is why this lony soldier doesn't have a quiver for his 'bows. I have deployed mine with a quiver, a sword and a spear. Just for ferocity.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
