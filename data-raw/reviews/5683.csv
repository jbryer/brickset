"bsmarthen","2007-05-26T14:26:45.93Z","ok","This set could have been so much better. The containers are great. The lift truck itself is good but the mechanics of it just dont work. The hook is fixed and you cant lower the boom enough to pick up a container. When you have one on the hook it is in front of the driver. How is he suposed to see around it? Like the idea just not how it turned out. Might have been better as a forklift.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-14T09:43:11.043Z","Ok, but could improve.","like other people mentioned this set would be much more useful with the port set. One of the limiting factors of the set is the fact that it cannot carry two cargo containers on top of each other. But this set is very realistic to the real thing. See,  http://www.american-material-handling.com/Terex/ContainerReachStacker.jpg for an image of the real thing!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-12-26T19:40:21.39Z","Wrong Piece Count","First off the set comes with 218 pieces and not 402 pieces as Brickset writes. Now on to the review. Costing about 26 dollars this set comes with one minifig, he's another one of the generic workers with a big smile on his face, a red hard hat, and an orange uniform. He also has a radio and a wrench clipped onto the each side of the vehicle. The pieces come in numbered bags, 1 is for the minifig and the containers, and bags labeled 2 are for the actual vehicle.
There are two containers the first is a sealed red one with easily detachable ends so you can put things into it. The second is a grey one with open sides it contains two oil drums and a pallet with some small red canisters on it. Lego included 2 black pieces with holes in them so the container stacker's hook can easily lift and transport crates. If you remove the black pieces the containers can be stacked on top of one another.
The container stacker is a fairly quick build but is big and very durable. To move the boom up and down you need to either push or pull on it. There are some Technic rods that go down into some Bionicle pieces that allow for up and down motion but can still maintain a secure connection. Because of this it actually requires a lot of force to move it around. There are no major advanced techniques used but there are a lot of green and black pieces. In all there are six wheels on the truck two in the back and, four on the front. The front wheels are connected via a Technic beam that passes through the center of the vehicle it’s the same for the back.
Overall this is a great add on to a harbor or a great parts pack for military builders. Because there are no major cons, I suggest you get one even if you’re not that into City as these could also be good for military bases or simply for parts. 5/5

"jd5775","2007-07-19T20:46:49.293Z","interesting...","This is my review for set 7992 Container Stacker.

Like other sets it the new city theme, all reflect previous models.  Yet, these new sets still have not matched the quality of the past.  This is a remake of the great set 4549.

Pros:
-Ok design

Cons:
-Inferior in every way to 4549
-Blockier feel with new containers
-Still juniorized (although better than before)
-Too many specialized pieces, not built on the basic bricks

Overall I believe that this set deserves a two.  I would recommend trying to get 4549 off ebay or bricklink, it truly is a great set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Isak","2007-08-27T00:36:38.38Z","It's Pretty Cool","I like it.  It's not the best set ever, but I still like it.  The crane doesn't go really high, but it goes high enough to lift the containers off the top of each other.  I also have Set 7945 (City Fire Station) and I was able to use the crane hook on the fire truck.  It works with some support from my hand when it's all the way extended.  The green container stacker truck body also looks sort of like a riding lawn mower without the crane put on.  The guy looks just like a bunch of my other City construction guys.  It is fun to have containers to move around.  I will probably use the part that works with the hook (the eye?) so I can lift other things too.  I put the Police Motorcycle 7235 into one of the containers and moved it around that way.  It just fits.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rad","2009-03-13T05:04:46.983Z","Good set, but needed a bit more thought","This is a good little set which was fun to build. It comes with 2 different types of containers and some accessories to stack in them, the stickers aren't too over done either.

The stacker itself is solidly built, the only real let down is the boom which doesn't extend too far and has an unusual hook arrangement. The other let down is the rear wheels don't move left or right so that restricts movement.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-03-29T21:14:57.47Z","A Complement for the Harbour/Airport","The main reason why I bought this set is because the color is really fit with the Cargo Plane (7734) that I already owned. It feels that the two sets are intended to be displayed together. The set also can be used easily in some harbor areas.<br><br>What I like about this set :<br>1. It feel really realistic.<br>2. It can fit in easily for the Cargo Plane, making the airport area of my city looks more alive and busy.<br>3. Very nice details for the items in the containers.<br>4. The boom really can be used for carrying the containers.<br><br>What I don't like about the set :<br>1. Unstable boom, so if you extend it too far and put some containers in the hook, the car will lost it's balance.<br>2. The use of stickers here and there. Again, Lego should consider to not using stickers anymore for their sets, cause the stickers really ruin the value of a set. <br><br>For you guys City builder and own a Harbor or an Airport, this is really a set that you have to buy, to make your city looks busier. <br><br><br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"legobagel","2010-10-13T15:32:14.107Z","Pretty Good","<p>The Container Stacker Is A set that nobody has or really knows about so that's why you don't see a review of&nbsp;the set often on websites like youtube however those who did buy the set made a great purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set contains 2 containers and the stacker it self and of course the minifigure which wears an orange vest and legs a red hat and a face that has a grin on it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience - The set takes around 15- 20 minutes to build it can have a complexed build due to the technic parts involved but for older lego fans it should be a peice of cake</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts - This set does contain a few unique part like the green slopes on the front and back of the stacker and also conatins a few technic parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability -The set by it self is ok to play but there is not much to do it all you stack containers the playability is much higher with the harbor (7994) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money - when the set was released in UK in 2007 it retail for £20 which was ok</p>
<p>and was exclusive to woolworths than LEGO decided to cut the price to £15 when woolworths went into administration in november 2008 they had a sale on EVERYTHING so i decided to buy this it was only £11.99 so it was a good deal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall- this set has good vaule for money wich is nice and some unique parts but lacks playability however i would totally recommened it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>final score</p>
<p>Building experience - 4/5</p>

<p>Parts - 5/5</p>

<p>Playability&nbsp; - 3/5</p>

"HaulingBricks","2023-04-12T15:25:43.11Z","Container Stacker 7992 Review","<p>This is a surprisingly awesome set.&nbsp; This is one of the first sets I acquired when I came out of my dark ages a few years back.&nbsp; I was looking for more Cargo themed sets and came across this set.&nbsp; I ordered it from eBay and this is the set that brought me back to LEGO.<br />
<br />
The building experience for this one is top-notch.&nbsp; I enjoyed most aspects of the build.&nbsp; It&#39;s a very sturdy model, can support its own weight when lifting the containers and is just fun to put together.&nbsp; The working rams to lift the liftarm is a blast to assemble and play with.</p>

<p>The part usage here is wonderful as well.&nbsp; I liked the Green 5 x 2 x 1 2/3 windscreens used as fenders over the front and rear axles, this looks great.&nbsp; The liftarm assembly is also great, and the two included cargo containers are a well-thought-out addition.</p>

<p>Playability is off the chain for this set.&nbsp; As a standalone set, it is quite fun to roll around moving containers, but it definitely gets much better when this set is combined with other sets that have cargo containers.&nbsp; A much-needed addition to my industrial area of my LEGO&nbsp;collection and one of the best additions to sets like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7994-1/LEGO-City-Harbor"">Harbor 7994</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60198-1/Cargo-Train"">Cargo Train 60198</a>.</p>

"Elisburg","2021-12-31T17:11:24.433Z","Great addition to any harbor or airport.","<p>This set has a decent look to it. It feels really realistic. It has a somewhat low price on the secondary market, which makes it easier to add to any city, or to a child&#39;s lego collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros/cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Looks realistic</p>

<p>2. Includes 2 containers</p>

<p>3. Has a large lifting force for a lego set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Somewhat hard raise the crane on the vehicle, but once in position, the crane and object it is lifting will stay in its position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It makes a great addition to any harbour, airport or child&#39;s lego collection. I would reccomend.</p>
