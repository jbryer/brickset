"miies","2007-05-26T17:14:19.823Z","Fun building","As I said in my review of the new &quot;7991 Recycle Truck&quot;, I'm thrilled to see Lego has finally seen again what Town/City is all about: not just police bikes and fire speedboats, but all kinds of ordinary town vehicles and buildings.

This truck is probably an updated version of the 1985 &quot;6682 Cement Mixer&quot;. I like the gigantic concrete barrel, the hose mechanisme and the &quot;rugged/heavy&quot; look of all the new trucks (did anyone notice almost all the front bumpers are built the same way?).

The set loses one point for the fact that the hose mechanism is illogical and impossible: how does the concrete flow from the barrel to the hose standard? The standard should be at the base of the barrel, not at the rear of the truck. However, the truck looks great overall. So, the conclusion is: almost perfect.

I really like the new city style lego has adopted since last year. It is such a big improvement from the sets of just a few years ago, there simply is no comparisson. 
To the set: It retails at 16,95 EURO, 23 USD in Europe. In the USA it retails at 14.99 USD, 11 EURO... Those exchange rates i just dont get it, probably taxation.. :(

Pros:
-nice cool design
-mostly standard bricks, except for the mixer itself
-builder minifig
-Use of the SNOT building technique
-real nice six studs wide design

Cons:
-cement mixer itself consist of two big blue bricks... :(

Conclusion:
a real nice sublement to the current City product line. A good set for children, has nice playability. Only down side is the cement mixer itself... two big playmobil like bricks... come on! that is just a BIG no no!!! Still would advice the set though, but it gets a reduction in the final score due to the two brick mixer..",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Widdi","2007-06-13T10:04:44.937Z","A little bit juniorized","I just got this set last weekend. It has a nice price point at 15€ here in germany and is in the spirit of the good old days, except for some juniorisation. the truck is an easy and straightforward build, at for me a little over an half hour resulting in a quite large 8-wheeler truck. 
Now to the details: It has a mechanism for the mixer spiral, which releases the dark-grey cement pieces after a while. There are side view mirrors on the sides of the cab. And it can be modified to a 2-seater, by changing the console with shift, another 1x2 with handle and 4 1x2s with 1 stud and you're set. 
There are only two things, that i don't like:

1. No doors, even with enough room for them, but this can be modified

2. The mixer is just two big pieces with a spiral inside, making it more playable, but a bit juniorized, too.

Overall a solid 4/5 for this model.

"Martin","2007-07-19T21:23:03.98Z","Great Play Value","The 2007 City sets are shaping up to be some of the best for a long time.  The Concrete Mixer is another in a line of City vehicles where more advanced building techniques are coming into the mainstream and producing something more realistic.

The rotating concrete mixer drum is a large two-piece unit but definitely adds to the play value.  It rotates nicely either by hand or using the drive mechanism and it cleverly churns out 1x1 round plates to add to the fun.

There's only one minifig and the hose assembly at the rear is a little weak.  However, all things considered, it's a nice colour scheme and a great selection of parts for a reasonable price tag.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-08-03T23:47:34.613Z","Limited edition?","First off I got this set in a toy'srus store a few days ago its box said it was a limited addition. On to the reveiw.

Pro's
- A good new minifig with a shovel.
- Looks very much like a modern cement truck which is good in my opinon.
- A new colour scheme thats differnt from the usall yellow.
- The cement mixer works very well and I think its fine that the mixer is made of two pieces.
- The cab is big and looks good. 
- Has some good pieces.
Cons's
- The place where the hose is attached to the nozzle is very weak and breaks lots.
- the truck is acually around 8 studs wide and that may case problems if your using old road plate with new cars in your town or city. As thers not enough room.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"diverdan","2007-08-20T15:18:39.957Z","Another great city addtion","This set and 7991 garbage truck are my first city sets (excluding trains) and I will have to say these sets have really got me in to the city theme.
First I would like to mention the barrel is made out of two separate pieces. Other reviewers did not seem to like this, but it's the only way for it to function. (It uses vanes to force &quot;concrete&quot; out the end.)
The chassis starts off pretty weak and flimsy but with the help of two 1x14's it's very strong. 
This is a nice set considering it has eight wheels. The truck has a detail rear bumper. The cab is also very detailed. Includes gears for a turning mechanism, which works well, however the &quot;concrete&quot; only has a 50% chance of coming out. (The vanes don’t extent quite far enough to the lip of the barrel.) It works much better if there is a lot of 1x1 circle pieces in the barrel. I do not like the hose rig in the set, for starters it’s unrealistic and gets in the way. Take it off! Instead of the hose I would have like to seen and chute for concrete to flow down (I made one on my truck with a few simple pieces) examples of this are at brickshelf.com key word 7990. The mini fig is nice too. So over all an excellent set, very cool to look at and will make a great addition to any construction or city set up.

Set 7990...213 pieces + $14.99 USD = great buy!

Only down side is the stickers, I wish LEGO would print the pieces and skip those darn stickers. This set is a great addition to my City and would recommend it highly.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Skut","2007-09-27T06:21:47.48Z","Outstanding","This set is a very worthy addition to any serious &quot;townie&quot;'s layout.  The best feature so far as I am concerned is the vane mechanism inside the barrel - adds realism and playability.  

Although some have complained that the barrel turning mechanism doesn't add to playability, I think it adds an extra dimension of interest for older builders who are not content simply to turn the barrel by hand.  

There have also been complaints about the hose mechanism.  I agree that it isn't realistic in a concrete context (as illustrated by Lego in the inbstructions and box art), but who says it has to be for concrete?  Real concrete mixers have a hose for the operator to wash excess concrete from the barrel and chute, and the hose attachment can easily represent this, especially if you remove the 1x1 yellow cone from the end.  

I agree that a concrete chute would have been a nice addition, but Lego has a budget to meet and the adddition of a MOC noncrete chute is a simple matter for any AFOL or older child builder.  

The set's colour scheme also makes it a nice successor to 6682 - when placed on the same construction site together, they simply look like two different mixer models from the same concree company!

"Burrows","2008-01-14T15:21:25.233Z","One of the best city set / az egyik legjobb v&#225;rosk&#233;szlet","(en:) At firs i wasn't so astonished seeing this set. Big parts, machanical pieces, and so on. I thought that playability will be much more important in this set than the joy of the building. But a few month earlier the was on sale in the nearest Tesco, and i bought it.  During the building my opinion had changed and at last, i can say that it absolutely worht it's afford. The mudguards, the hose and the number plate stickers are ideals for starting car-making. The colour is also a great idea, and the minifig is good enought, too. The only cons which can i mention are the extremely difficult sticker putting -up (according to the building instruction it is impossible to put the blue-white stripped big stickers to the half-containers alone; you can try to put-in into the whole container in one part, but itt will be still annoying, and it won't fit, becouse the sticks are not long enought to cover the whole halp container and mett at the fitting point), but i still like stickers. All in all, it is better than you expect, and i recommend it to you!

"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-06T19:49:23.34Z","Much better than the classic one","This cement mixer is by far the best contruction vehicle! Not only is the design nice, but the drum is actually funtional, making it my favourite part of the set . When you rotate the drum, the vanes inside it bring the pieces of cement upward. Pretty cool, huh? Instead of manually turning the drum, it uses a gear system that does the work for you, unlike the old one (but you still have to turn a knob to activate the gears, but in turn, the drum spins REALLY fast). I mean, the old cement mixer had a microscopic drum that couln't fit any cement, making it look unrealistic and awkward. Other features of the new cement mixer include, hose, shovel, and worker minifig, the usual stuff. The only problem is that the hose constantly falls off, even with its rotating abilities. I got advice for owners of this set: The drum falls off easily if you don't lock it in ALL the way, meaning there is still a gap between it and the piece it's attached to. If you fix that problem, the drum won't fall off. Overall, the price is decent and so is the set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"monki","2008-12-04T18:26:57.2Z","Another great lego set","This is another well designed truck by Lego.

"SRoode","2009-01-19T21:01:17.42Z","The Most Fun You Can Have for $15","Where to start on this set?  Wow!  This is a set that as an adult I have almost as much fun playing with as I did putting it together.  The rotating drum mechanism is ingenious, and works very well to pump out the ""cement"".  8 wheels (gray centers to boot!), 2 gears, and a beautiful blue color (getting a little tired of all of our construction sets being yellow).  It is a very beautiful set, and lots of little pieces that fit well together and make the model very sturdy.  The only minuses, of course stickers (minus of all the new sets though), and I agree with the previous review, the hose has a tendency to come loose.  Other than that, it is a perfect set, especially for $15.

"mags","2009-09-02T15:03:17.67Z","Great set with minor flaws","This set gets a 4 for looks, design and general playability. However, there are some drawbacks. As has been mentioned, the hose/funnel attachment is really not good at all - it falls off to easily. With small kids playing with it, this is a bit of a downer. Also, the fastening mechanism for the mixer drum could have been a bit tighter. As it is, the mixer drum is wont to fall off if picked up by someone (my wife) who's not aware of its fragility. My final gripe is that the axle length makes for difficult turning, as well as having the two wheelsets live separate lives - i.e. the back set doesn't really touch the ground that much when the unit is driven. But don't let this deter you! The set is really fun, and these things are really minor. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-10-06T03:39:24.42Z","Another Great Lego City Truck…","I got this at the same time I bought the Recycle Truck (7991).   I was in ‘Toys R Us’ and saw this on the shelf next to set 7991 and thought it looked attractive so I picked one up too.   I built this right after building the Recycle Truck and I can honestly say it was another enjoyable hour spent.

The build was really straightforward (I take my time and enjoy the process) it is nice to see a four axle truck for a change, have you noticed the white wheel arch under the cab and the black wheel arches situated around the ‘work zone’?   Great attention to detail by the Lego design team and very representative of the real thing.   The cab seats the one minifig which is supplied with the set; there is also what appears to be a gearstick mounted in the cab.   A large grill with lights and a number plate is also provided, there are also roof-mounted amber lights and a cement mixer logo (sticker) attached to a bracket.   Realistic wing mirrors are also mounted just below the windscreen.

The actual mixer unit is mounted behind the truck cab, a mechanism is provided on a ‘titled’ bracket which then holds the mixer drum.   There is a control knob provided to enable the mixer drum to be rotated, a handy sticker identifies the correct direction for turning.   Mounted low down on the side of the chassis is a control panel with indicator gauge and handle.   Right at the end of the truck is the all-important hose and trigger arrangement which allows the ‘cement’ to be dispensed from the drum.   This is, I think, the worst part of the set.   It is pretty realistic, but the arrangement is far too flimsy and the trigger comes adrift every time I touch it!

The minifig is provided in utilitarian white and blue overalls and red hard hat.   He also appears to have ‘gloves’ on.

In summary, another great set which is on display along with the Recycle Truck.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
