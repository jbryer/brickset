and worst of all: instead of a minifig there is a brick-made humanoid. hello? what are kids most fond of at the time they leave their duplo-stuff behind? THE MINIFIGS! they spend hours taking them apart, putting them back together, moving the limbs - basically what a minifig is good for, right. so what sense is there in providing a brick tub with a house, door, window, but no decent minifig?

"knuclear200x","2009-06-24T11:14:23.153Z","I too got it for free","I swore I reviewed this too...anyways, like the other guy, I got this blue box for free with a $30 lego purchase which consisted of the Bionice Gadunka and Glatorian Malum.

I can be a sucker for numbers. And when the set posts 221 I was pretty much ecstatic about getting it for free, and because I can be sooo cheap. And with the size of the box, one would think that all Two Hundred and Twenty-one pieces would fill that box halfway to the top. But no. Once you unwrap everything and dump everything in there, it only fills about 1/3 of it. Seems the bucket was meant for other uses, but as for me I already had bigger places to store lego blocks.

As for the pieces themselves. They're just a bunch of basic pieces with a handful of advanced ones like the levers, the door and the window with a few flower blocks thrown in. No minifigs included, just a block with a face on it and some eye blocks for creatures. On a side note, that's so stupid. What kinda play value can i get for a minifig thats just a face and a bunch of blocks?! Bla Bla Bla end rant luckily I can find a million uses for things like that.

Conclusion:
If you do want to buy this set, don't buy it for yourself. Buy it for your friend/relative's kid. 

If you do want to buy it for yourself, assuming you're a more advanced builder as I am, just buy theme sets. If you're in need of a bucket, spend your hard-earned cash on some other better buckets that have wheels and minifigs. It truly is better off a freebie even though it aint that great, but at least you won't feel like you wasted money.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2009-09-10T04:21:06.06Z","Painfully Disappointing","221 pieces is really not much for building, I think this box is more expensive in the bucket rather in the bricks. The bucket is waaaaay larger rather than needed (although it comes in handy if you want to put your tall creation in it, however it's a rare condition). If they cut the bucket by 60%, the price would come in rational enough. 
I get it only bacause it's put in 50% at Metro Department Store and because I'm pretty bored with themed set.  Basically, this is pretty disappointing. I build 4 ships with various sizes with it, ranging from 3 stud long to about 18 stud.
Overall, it's CERTAINLY not worth for IDR 370.000,- (US$ 37), it's barely enough with a 50% discount.
Pros:
pretty much slope part
colourful

cons:
too few parts
huge bucket",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Builder97","2009-06-23T17:55:16.357Z","A Good Freebie","I got this free at my local TRU because if you spent $30 on lego (I bought the Beach House and Pirate Survival) they would give it to you free. It's an OK set but could be a lot better. There's less bricks in there than it looks and it doesn't even have a real minifigure. I don't think I would buy this but I would definintly take it for free.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Boidoh","2009-07-03T08:34:04.2Z","Too Little Parts","222 parts seems alot. It is.. WRONG. Its too little. This one i could build out of this is a LEGO Penguin and a house also a snail and a small car.
