"Be_Burger","2010-12-30T02:00:40.6Z","Title says all","<p>Its called the Large Brick Box, and thats what it is. A large box with bricks. Nothing more, nothing less. There is one minifigure but he's not that great. I recieved this as a gift a couple years back, and it does have a lot of nice bricks, although not as many as you would think from a ""large brick box"". If you're looking for a cheap way to get a lot of bricks, then heres a good choice, but, there are better choices that are out now-a-days like <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=6177&amp;cn=306&amp;d=362"">this set</a>.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,2,3

<h2>Packaging/Instructions</h2>

<p>This set does not come in a box, but instead a plastic container, which you can store the bricks in when finished with the set. It has a transparent lid and on the back, it lists the parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is around 37 pages and contains advertisements for the Lego Club, Lego Shop at Home, 6163 A World of LEGO Mosaic, 6162 Building Fun with LEGO, 628 X-Large Baseplate Grey, 626 Building Plate, Green, 5482 Ultimate House, and 4780 Bulk Set - 500 Bricks.</p>

<h2>Notable Parts</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The old doors and windows.</li>
	<li>Tool accessories.</li>
	<li>4217794 Door Frame 2X4X5</li>
	<li>The Green Baseplate</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no exclusive parts in this set.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There is only one Minifigure in this set, a redhead in blue&nbsp;overalls and cap. None of the&nbsp;pieces used to make up this Minifigure&nbsp;are rare.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>This set comes with instructions for five builds, although there are some other models featured on the pages. You <strong>cannot</strong> build <strong>some</strong> sets at the same time, like in 40411 Creative Fun 12-in-1.</p>

<h3>The Small Car</h3>

<p>This is one of the two different cars in this set. The second one might be a truck though.</p>

<p>It is a basic red car with no doors that can open. It can fit one minifigure.</p>

<h3>The Helicopter</h3>

<p>The helicopter is, in my opinion, the best build of this set. It&#39;s&nbsp;just a microbuild, but at least it&#39;s better than the other builds.</p>

<h3>The Wall of a House</h3>

<p>I think this is supposed to be the front of a house. It is minifig-scale, but there is basically no reason to build this unless you build the other three walls.</p>

<h3>The Car/Truck Thing</h3>

<p>This is at least a better looking car, although it has no doors whatsoever. It has an engine and can hold up to three 1X1X1 bricks on its cargo bed. It is also minifig-scale.</p>

<h3>The House</h3>

<p>This is the main build, but it looks horrible. It is not big enough, it&#39;s too squished, there&#39;s this support-thing that has no use, the color scheme is bad (except for the light and dark blue), and there&#39;s a bunch of empty space.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>As I said in the beginning, this is mainly a spare parts set. There is only one good build in the instructions, but I&#39;ll list the ones that look okay/good to me.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Helicopter</li>
	<li>The Horse</li>
	<li>The Tree/Bush with Birds</li>
	<li>That Truck with Eyes for Headlights</li>
	<li>The Racing Car</li>
	<li>The Tractor</li>
	<li>The Truck with a &quot;T&quot; on it</li>
	<li>The Mechanic&#39;s Shop</li>
	<li>The Car Disassembling Thing</li>
	<li>The Cottage with the Bird on it</li>
	<li>The Windmill (With the Trees)</li>
	<li>The Boat colored Red and Yellow</li>
</ul>
