I couldn't believe how builders were using LEGO to create photo-like mosaics out of our favorite little building brick. Then I learned that LEGO was making Mosiac sets one day while visiting Brickset and was happy to learn that LEGO was accepting this art form and selling their own sets. However, I think that it is an idea from the fans and not the company itself. The clear 16 x 16 plates are great as they do not distract the viewer from your finished art work. The selection of light blue, lime green and green is a plus but they are all 1x1 bricks. Check out some pics of mosaics that I made using my pieces and the pieces from this set on my brickshelf gallery. Search for the user notenoughbricks and open my Video Game Mosaics folder. When will the LEGO company produce 32 x 32 Clear Base plates for even larger mosaic possibilities?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-12-17T20:49:02.42Z","New Clear Baseplate.","For fifth teen dollars this set packs a load of those 1 by 1 bricks.
In total there are about 250 of them including a lot of green and some and about 8 orange 1 by 1's. Unfortunately there are no grey 1 by 1's. It also includes some other assorted pieces. The instructions are simple all you have to do is put the clear base plate overtop of a diagram then put the bricks over the similar colours similar to tracing.
As mentioned before the base plate is clear so there is no background colour to interfere with your mosaic. It can also be used 
for making clear stands for planes or spaceships.
Even if you just want it for the clear base plate I would highly recommend it. 5/5
