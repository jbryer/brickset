The selection of pink, light blue, orange, lime green and green 1x1 bricks is great. I just wish that I could buy a set that had these colors in a variety of pieces, instead of the 1x1 brick but then it wouldn't be a mosaic set now would it? 2 clear base plates are included and these are awesome. The directions are easy but I couldn't wait to create my own mosaics. Check them out on my brickshelf gallery (search my user name, notenoughbricks----then open my video game mosaic folder to see for yourself). I know others have done similar work but I couldn't wait to use LEGO to create &quot;8-bit sprites.&quot; This set is ranked higher than the smaller mosaic set because of the greater selection of bricks and extra clear base plate.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

You just get the white plastic and put it over the instructions and you just put the Lego pieces on their and you get a Lego mosaic!  It is ok and I gave it a three because I got it and thought....ok this is kind of cool, but another set would have been cooler!  Thanks for reading the review and I hope you enjoyed it!  Remember to look at my other reviews!

I know it doesnt have much in the way of playability but you can still make mosaics and hand then up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TinyHippo","2008-09-09T16:27:04.827Z","Not bad at all","Lots of assorted 1x1 bricks to feast on, and transparent boards, to boot. The ideas provided are just the tip of the iceberg of possible makes. The main problem I had was that my boards are not very sturdy, and can break. Other than that, lots of fun.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JC75","2011-03-17T00:06:36.09Z","Worth the money!","This set is just fantastic! At a great price I just had to go and buy two of them! It includes many, many 1x1 pieces in a variety of colors, along with the transparent base plates, which could be useful if you were making a frozen pond or something of that sort. The idea books are also pretty neat to look through. Overall this set scores me about a 4/5, totally worth the money!",FALSE,4,5,4,4,5
