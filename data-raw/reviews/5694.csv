Pros:)
.Exploding feature is cool
.driver seat area is nice
.nice build
.nice wing thing
.nice orange lights
.nice red colour

Cons:(
.STICKERS!
Overall,wait you probably want to know why this is kind of short well......i don't know,anyway Overall 10/10 good set even for non racer fan's and great for the exploding feature.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
