"Alemas","2009-05-19T17:54:22.967Z","First to review here!","The 2007 Power Racers had a cool function: when they crash, parts come off! This set does just that, and has cool pieces: two engines, and two aircraft engines!

Pros:

Pieces come off when crashed
Pull-back motor
""Butch"" style
Big wheels

Cons:

You have to crash it pretty hard to make the pieces come off

Overall, a cool set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
