Built around a blocky engine, it is easy to assemble, very sturdy (apart from the fins at the back which tend to snap off) and has a &quot;crash&quot; gimmick that's entertaining for two or three minutes.

That said, it is a bit limited. You make it go in a straight line, send it into a wall and...that's it. Also, it isn't well-suited to being rebuilt into designs of your own, partly because of the stickers, partly because it uses a number of non-standard parts that don't blend well with other sets.

The low price and included engine just about manage to make this a worthwhile purchase.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
