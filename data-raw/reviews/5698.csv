This was the 1st set from the Power Racers category I have built. These sets come with 2 instruction booklets, one for the pictured model and one for combining this set with two of the smaller Power Racers (8139 and 8136) to make 2 more Racers out of these sets. 

The set and line rely more on Technic beams, gears and pieces than LEGO bricks so this was something that I was looking forward to completing to see how these parts would work. Technic is functionally awesome but not as pleasing aesthetically. This set is a tow truck and it looks like an A-Team assault vehicle from the 80's TV show. There are several black sloped pieces for the windshield that I love building with. These are my 2nd favorite parts (my favorite being the cheese slopes). The wheels are a great addition to my collection as is the motor. The Technic parts are amazing! This car's sides and front hood fly off of the body when it crashes head first into a wall. The stickers are beautiful and really add to the look of the truck.

Overall this is a pretty cool set because of the functioning motor, wheels, and the parts like to sloped bricks, engine grill, wedge plate, hoses, and engine bricks. I just wish the set looked more like a tow truck.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Parts</h4><p>There aren't all that many ""standard"" stud-centered LEGO pieces here, instead a large portion of the pieces are in the stick style, like the old Technic bits.&nbsp; That said, the few ""traditional"" pieces included are great.&nbsp; Of particular interest are several silver pieces that should be fun to incorporate into MOCs.&nbsp; I'm already anticipating building some kind of minifig scaled vehicle that incorporates the included motor.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None.&nbsp; And the complete model isn't even to minifig scale.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>This was the highlight of the set for me.&nbsp; As I've mentioned, my LEGO tastes tend to run toward the traditional minifig centered sets, so this was a very different and very interesting build experience.&nbsp; It was, at times, challenging without ever being frustrating and held my interest throughout the process.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>But then I finished building the thing and was left with . . . what, exactly?&nbsp; This is one goofy looking model.&nbsp; Even putting aside my disappointment that the model isn't minifig scale, the scale of the completed model makes no sense.&nbsp; You have what is apparently a massive engine housing with a tiny, tiny cabin on the back of what amounts to a semi truck connected to what looks like an external engine that's built on top of the tow boom.&nbsp; Or maybe there's no cabin at all, just two big engines with no need for a driver.&nbsp; In either case, there are also two big . . . things? . . . that hang off the side of the tow truck.&nbsp; Are they wings?&nbsp; Are they jet engines?&nbsp; Are they extra parts thrown in so that this model looks bigger and can more effectively combine with a couple other sets per the additional instruction book?&nbsp; Well, whatever it's supposed to look like, it has one of those little motors that winds when you pull the truck backward and then drives it forward when you let go.&nbsp; That makes for some playability, right?&nbsp; Add to that the fact that if the truck runs into an obstacle with sufficient force the fuselage that hangs off either side goes flying off.&nbsp; Frankly the truck looks better once its crashed and thrown off those extra pieces<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I found this set for $10 at a local Big Lots store, and the build experience alone was worth that price, particularly when you throw in the silver pieces and the motor.&nbsp; Original retail was $20, though, and I'd have a hard time recommending this set at that price.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,5,4,3
