"bmwlego","2007-11-17T13:30:52.843Z","Thanks again Chris!","I celebrated my 31st birthday last weekend and received this set from my friend Chris. 
This was the 2nd set from the Power Racers category I have built. These sets come with 2 instruction booklets, one for the pictured model and one for combining this set with two of the smaller Power Racers (8137 and 8138) to make 2 more Racers out of these sets. 

As I stated in my review of 8140, Technic is functionally awesome but not as pleasing aesthetically. This set is a pick up truck and it looks like a pick up truck! This set has much more of a Technic look than a LEGO look. The lime green color is beautiful and the stickers really pop and stand out! The wheels are a great addition to my collection as is the motor. The Technic parts are amazing! This car's sides and front hood fly off of the body when it crashes head first into a wall. 

Overall I enjoyed this set more than the tow truck because it looks stunning. The color, stickers and form of the pick up are just excellent. Like the tow truck, I was happy to add the functioning motor, and larger wheels to my collection. The lime green bricks were also a bonus. This set is an example of how great this line can be!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The crashing mechanism worked fine, and 2 years later, it is still a&nbsp;success. This set is mainly great because it lets you build 2 different combi-models with the 8137 or the 8138. It is also bigger than the other ""double combi"" set in this subtheme. (The 8140.) The colours and the stickers are also a nice addiction. At the back, there is enough space for you to fit the 6742 or the 7241 right in without problems.</p><p>Yes, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;two cons. However, as there was a parts list at the back of the building instructions, I quickly ordered enough bricks to take away all the cons.</p><p>Overall, if you've got the&nbsp;8137 or the 8138, or if you're just waiting to smash your other&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;sets, this is just the set you've been waiting for.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3
