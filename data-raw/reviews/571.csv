"shenron","2007-12-28T07:56:44.78Z","Harmless","This is such a small set that it should be considered a single minifigure, that comes with a boat as an accessory.

The minifigure itself is quite ok and has some hard to find shirt and face, and female minifigs are always welcome.

The boat is nothing impressive (15 pieces), although at least a couple of pieces could have been split in two, thus increasing the piece count.

If looking for pieces of unusual color, this set has some pink ones, but only a tiny few.

Overall a harmless addition to any Legoland town.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

However, I was most pleased as that time it was my first female minifig, wig, and also a life jacket. Oh, first boat as well. If only they added a pair of oars or a tiny rudder, it would be better!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2011-04-17T15:48:24.263Z","A Paradisa reminder","<p>I managed to acquire this set just incidentally, if I can say so... I didn't even know, that it was a ""Limited release"", I bought 1761 only because this one was a <em>Paradisa</em> set.</p><p>This one is quite simple: a boat, a girl and her life jacket. Fortunately or not that's actually it.</p><p><strong>The Boat.</strong></p><p>The boat is made of classic bricks of those times (e.g. most planes were using these as a basis for the cockpit, etc.), with the exception, that this set (as all Paradisa do) has light pink details, that form the upper line of the boat. It also has some other details (like steering control I believe) and some others as to provide a chance to build a slightly different ""transport"" for this girl.</p><p><strong>The minifig.</strong></p><p>The girl itself represents the classic Paradisa character, the main attributes of which are a pink shirt with light flowers as well as a head with red lips (the ones that appeared on Lego faces for the first time). It also has the now-classic black ponytail hair. Some people say,that the life jacket is something really worthy in this set. Probably they're right.</p><p><strong>1761 and other Paradisa sets.</strong></p><p>Taking into account, that Lego released quite a variety of sets for this series, I would say, that 1761 isn't the most amusing one. Definitely, there are a lot of others that have a lot more rare and interesting details as well as peculiar design and building ideas.</p><p>On the other hand - I have to add - if You have a chance to buy this particular set, but never got an opportunity to know the Paradisa series, then don't hesitate and add it to your collection.</p><p>I believe that fans of Town and City series would understand what I mean.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
