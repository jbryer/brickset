Pros:
As you would expect, all the pieces are nice and big so even my ""little moose"" can't swallow one.
The piece with the door that can swing open and closed is a big hit and stays on with a little rough play even.
The cat piece is a cute idea for a ""mini-fig"" for this age group.
The eyes on the blocks are printed on, and are easy to use to make larger animals.
I love the plastic case that you can use for storage... helps to teach the kids how to pick up their toys!

Cons:
It would have been nice to have something with wheels.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I know I'd gotten my daughter a couple buckets of this set when she was about a year and a half. She wasn't quiet ready for them, but soon enough she was into them and making towers and castles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a wide range and assortment of basic blocks, a little door and even a cat minifigure. Just seeing the hours my daughter has had with these toys is well worth the money and investment.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
