It also happens happens to be my first review also, being a brand new member. Got to start somewhere right? I am no rookie when it comes to Legos though and I can tell good sets from bad. This one would fall into the latter category. I couldn't say that for most of Lego sets though. I can't even remember buying this or building this, that's how old and insignificant it is. I'm pretty sure it was my older brother's at one point. Anyway, there isn't one unique piece in this ""set."" Only the octane&nbsp;mini-figure&nbsp;has any value. But if you want a cheap car to fill in a spot in your Lego City, this should get some consideration.",FALSE,2,1,1,3,4

As far as I could find, and I could easily be wrong here, that nickname is entirely a fan-made term, I don&#39;t remember hearing nor seeing that phrase during the time period when I was a consumer of such sets nor can I find any official Lego documentation calling it that. The fact that if you say &quot;Town Jr.&quot; to a Lego fan they immediately go &quot;oh yeah, that late nineties Town line of sets with no roofs, ten to fifteen pieces per set, and very little in the way of playability, I know what you&#39;re talking about&quot; is probably the most brutal testament to the legacy of these sets that I know of.</p>

<p>That said, I did grow up with them and when you don&#39;t know the alternative you don&#39;t really mind. I remember vividly absolutely loving most of the sets from the period, because I was around ten years old and liked building things and modelling the world around me. Nowadays you look at town sets and see fifty thousand different playability enhancing moving parts and other features and just think &quot;good lord, how good kids have it nowadays with this&quot;. Lego went and made an excellent model of a mine. I would have absolutely killed for a mine Lego set when I was a kid. Instead, I got stuff like this from the Town Jr. range mostly, and honestly, I really did have some great memories and still do with some of them. It wasn&#39;t all garbage.</p>

<p>This, however, is an exception. This set is garbage. Not &quot;Fire Chief&#39;s Car&quot;-tier garbage, but it&#39;s pretty close.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>On the positive side, it does in fact resemble a go-kart if you squint hard enough. You can imagine the two cylinders on the back as engine blocks and the roll bar as a seat back and you&#39;ve got a go-kart. Why would you need a go-kart for your Lego town? Beats me, but if you do, here&#39;s one of them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it looks ugly and is literally as basic as a Lego set can get. I promise you, absolutely promise you, give any given eight year old four wheels and a pile of plates and bricks and they&#39;ll come up with a more interesting and inspired set than this. I know it&#39;s an impulse set, but some impulse sets are excellent (Cargo Delivery Truck from 1997 for instance), you can do a lot with a little with Lego, that&#39;s part of the fun of it. This set, however, does even less with a little than just selling the parts separately would have done.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>I&#39;m not kidding, I&#39;ve seen MOC&#39;s made out of Duplo that look more interesting and probably were more interesting to build than this car is.You stack six tiny bricks on some wheels. That&#39;s it. You get as basic as a Lego car can be.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>None of note. You get some wheels, which are nice to have. You also get a minifigure which is nice. Not a rare one or anything but I&#39;ll take anything with Octan branding on it.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>The displayability is nil. It doesn&#39;t really look like anything of note and it&#39;s so small and boring your eyes aren&#39;t drawn to it at all in a display. The playability however is at least existent, simply by virtue of being a Lego set with wheels and a minifigure. Kids like that sort of thing if they&#39;re imaginative enough. That said it&#39;s more fun to take it apart and make something else out of it with other bricks you have laying around.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Well, it&#39;s cheap, so that&#39;s in its favor. It&#39;s also not a good set and has nothing you need and you can probably build the thing out of spare parts you have laying around so that&#39;s not in its favor.</p>

<p>All in all I don&#39;t know who I&#39;d recommend this to. Nobody, probably. Unless you absolutely, positively have to have a go-kart thing in your town, there&#39;s no reason to get this one.</p>
