The spikes add a little something, and the arms are definitely the hight point of Takadox (minus the squid launcher). A fairly good set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-08T11:52:01.903Z","Mantis creature","This barraki is based in a pray mantis real creature. The weapons looks like very. The head is cool, a glow in the dark stuff, with three other armors. He is tall, but don't have very armors, liking to be weak. He have a squid launcher. It don't shot very well. Without some armors, takadox includes some spikes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-10-14T04:59:31.983Z","Lean Mean Fighting Machine! ","Despite there being a really long and weird title to this review, the review itself will not be really long and weird. In short Takadox is a brilliant set and is a must have for all Bionicle lovers.
His mask suits the mandibles, his preying mantis like weapons look the part and the only dumb thing about him is that lame squid launcher which doesn't even hold the squids, let alone launch them into underwater Matoran. But this problem is easily fixed by simply taking it off and keeping him with just the preying mantis weapons. 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I was dissapointed with the squid since they fall out of their  launchers and holders.Takadox resembles a mantis shrimp, an invertebrate that uses its front arms to kill it's prey faster than the blink of an eye.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T16:26:31.997Z","A great Barraki","He's big, evil, and just plain great.  The glow-in-the-dark pieces top it all off, and the swords and mandibles add to his evil look. The squids, though, break and flip over as they fly through the air.  But otherwise, a great Barraki!!

Pros:

-Glows in the dark!!

-Swords have teeth

-Mandibles

-Spikes all over him

-Squids can go far

Cons:

-Squids flip head over tail

Takadox is a grand set!!  Go online and get him!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Squidtron","2009-12-30T13:45:16.747Z","Takadox.","Takadox king of sea bugs sounds a little wierd, but you can't have creepy muntant glow in the dark war lords without wierdness. Well enough of that, onto his design (which is a masterpeice). A clever use of structural parts that are mainly use on big charactors gives this set the illusion of being a creepy half-human deep sea monster. This is emphasized with the fact that he glows in the dark. Unlike most bionicles his design gives many building options (but he has a small number of peices so you need more to do stuff with the possibilities).

Now for the cool/not cool things about this set:
Glow In the Dark(+2)
Good Design(+3)
Useful Parts(+1)
Not a Lot of Pieces(-1)

AND THE GRAND TOTAL IS... 5/5 a great set!

A must buy for any bionicle lover.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"PaulTR","2010-12-23T17:02:26.417Z","The Nasty Genius of the Barraki (Who Glows in the Dark!)","I bought this Barraki from a Toys R Us a few years ago, and after putting&nbsp;him together, proudly placed&nbsp;him on my extensive Bionicle shelf, where&nbsp;he's been scarring me ever since. One of the best of the&nbsp;Barraki, Takadox is a great set and should be a must-have for hard-core Bionicle fans.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>First off, Takadox is a very&nbsp;vicious looking set. With spikes, clawed feet, hooked blades, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;hungry face,&nbsp;he looks nasty and conniving, which makes him a perfect Barraki. I like how the designers used clear arm and leg pieces, making him seem like a&nbsp;deep water&nbsp;anglerfish. And at night, his thigh-armor, back, and face glow in the dark! I don't know how many times I've walked into my room&nbsp;at night and&nbsp;been scared to death by his&nbsp;glowing, toothy&nbsp;face; I think this feature alone sets him apart from&nbsp;the other Barraki, and puts him&nbsp;in a&nbsp;'class of creepy' all on his own. However, there is a minor problem: Takadox is very skinny. When viewed straight&nbsp;on, Takadox looks like a scary telephone pole with arms and legs. Personally,&nbsp;I don't mind it, because&nbsp;I pose him hunched over and to the side, but other people may be turned off by his lankiness.&nbsp;So, as far as looks go, Takadox is a great (if a bit skinny) looking set.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Takadox is a pleasent build, and&nbsp;was for me a refreshing experience from&nbsp;building too many bad-guy clones over the years (Vahki, Visorak,&nbsp;you get my point.)&nbsp;In general,&nbsp;Takadox was a&nbsp;great build and probably&nbsp;won't make anyone doze off&nbsp;from boredom. On the other hand,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;the building experience&nbsp;probably won't&nbsp;make you go ""Whoa, that's awesome!"" either. What WILL make you&nbsp;happy, however,&nbsp;is the pieces:&nbsp;see-through arms and legs, spiked blades, Piraka feet and legs, and that conniving mask of his will&nbsp;set MOCers' hearts a-flutter. And all those red spikes&nbsp;are great for regular LEGO MOCers as well.&nbsp;As an extra&nbsp;bonus,&nbsp;Takadox&nbsp;has the most pieces (62) out of any of the Barraki. Yay!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Now, all of these great things about Takadox would mean nothing if you couldn't play with him, and&nbsp;thankfully,&nbsp;Takadox strongly delivers in the ""fun"" category. You can swing Takadox's blades, click his jaws, and try to shoot his squid launcher; I say 'try' because, as everyone&nbsp;else before me has&nbsp;said, the squid launchers are a pain to shoot. However, I like the concept, and if the designers had made the launchers have a little spring&nbsp;and attachment piece,&nbsp;I think it would have made a sweet underwater-crossbow&nbsp;weapon.&nbsp;As another downside,&nbsp;there are no action features like gears or spinning&nbsp;weapons for Takadox. Boo.&nbsp;But enough griping! Takadox is still a&nbsp;joy to play with,&nbsp;and you can&nbsp;use&nbsp;him&nbsp;in&nbsp;'ambush' situations, where he can&nbsp;attack Toa&nbsp;by&nbsp;wielding&nbsp;his nifty little knives. Swish! Slash! (Yes, I&nbsp;love to play&nbsp;with my Bionicles; isn't it obvious?:)&nbsp;Takadox is&nbsp;great to pose as well, with his hunched over appearence and curled up, mantis-like arms. As I said before, he doesn't look like 5-star material when viewed from a&nbsp;front view, but he's not meant to be; he's supposed to be a twisted, hunched over genius.&nbsp;Now, as far as his price goes, I'm convinced he's totally&nbsp;worth it: while some may balk at a $9.99 US dollars price tag when compared to the Piraka's $8.99 US dollars price tag,Takadox is&nbsp;SOOOO much more unique and cool; he, and by extension the other Barraki, are creative and fresh enemies in the Bionicle universe. But I bet I'm talking your ear off! On to the facts!<br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-Nasty looking and really spiky! <br/>-Unique and cool pieces <br/>-Sturdy, playable, and poseable <br/>-Best parts-to-piece ratio amongst the Barraki <br/>-He glows in the dark! How cool is that!?<br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-Medicore build <br/>-Doesn't look too good from the front <br/>-Squid launchers are, lets face it, worthless <br/>-Price hiked from the 2006 product year<br/>The verdict? Pick up Takadox. He's creepy, has more pieces than any other Barraki, and is&nbsp;tons of fun&nbsp;to play with (Ambush!) Plus, he glows in the dark! How cool is that!? Don't hesitate: buy him!",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
