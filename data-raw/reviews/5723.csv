They bend a lot its fun to bend the tentacals around the Toa or other Barraki. I like the Toa Inika better then the Barraki. But dont think the Barraki stink they are still cool sets especaily if you want some scary lookin bad guys to fight thos cool looking Toa.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The Barraki were to many a positive sign for Bionicle. While some of them were mediocre in design, none of them were clones in any way, all featuring unique piece selections, and completely different looks and builds.

Kalmah is both interesting and boring in terms of set design and piece selection. While some things about him may be cool, others are completely unoriginal.

The first thing you notice about the Barraki is their canisters. Opening at the bottom like the Rahkshi canisters, these giant things have a lid that’s the color of the contained Barraki, and a giant, bubbly blue container, that is slanted sideways. While the lit may be a bit cruddy on the inside, this canister design is one of my favorites, and helps to achieve the underwater theme very nicely.

Kalmah features several new molds, some unique to him, and other shared by the Barraki. His face, tentacles, feet, and red/black armor pieces can not be found in any other Barraki, but his squid launcher, eyes, and jaws can. And of course, there’s the standard selection of parts, including a Piraka body, black joints, and red Rahkshi legs.

Kalmah’s head is my favorite Barraki head, mainly because it gives him a powerful and creepy look. The black rubber tentacles on the back are a really nice touch. Plus, it doesn’t look ugly like Pridak’s head, just meancing. The Tentacles are interesting, but because no other kit this year or last has orange in its color scheme, using them will be hard unless you have older kits. I really like the feet: they are a cool underwater take on the useful Hordika feet, and look great on Kalmah. I also like the red and black armor pieces; despite the two tones, I see uses for them, since red and black are common colors in Bionicle.

The 3 pieces found in all Barraki sets are something else. The jaws and eyes both are very cool pieces, and I can see many uses for them in MOCs. However, the Squid launcher is a piece of crud: only one axle point and it’s extremely rubbery and flimsy.

Then, there is the squid. Because they are really just pieces of rubber, I don’t consider them molds, but just pointless crud. Seriously, they not only look and feel cheap, but the only method of shooting them is unreliable and impossible to aim or make the squid go reasonable distances.

Once put together, Kalmah is quite a sight. The orange tentacles, blue eyes, and white teeth look great next to the mainly red and black design, and the silver looks good as well. However, there are a couple of quibbles I have. First of all, the backwards Piraka body “design” seems a bit cheap, but more importantly, the two-toned armor plates are very loose when attached by axles instead of pins. Still, Kalmah is okay in design, and the detail work helps make him look cooler.

Overall, Kalmah is pretty good, and I’m glad I got him as a gift. He may not be spectacular, but he is different from all the other Barraki, and looks pretty cool. I recommend you get Mantax or Ehlek first, though. 8/10

"dy_enforcer","2007-11-24T22:14:35.92Z","A Cold-Blooded Barraki","Kalmah is a very unique barraki design.he has no mask,however he has a face with three blue eyes and five small black tentacles on the back of his head.His new pieces include claws in his mouth,tentacles on his left hand and a squid launcher on the right hand.the claws in his mouth are somewhat strange to me but on the other hand this represents the symbol of the 6 barraki if you know what I mean.He has a weapon called a tentacle.This is the first time a barraki doesn't have a unique artificial weapon tool,so he use a tentacle as a weapon.Some reviewers say Squid Launchers doesn't really fire.For me it really fires.Its simple,you hold the squid and put it in the squid launcher.Make sure that its loosen not tight,maybe thats why you can't fire the squid properly.Finally,fire it really fast so it won't tighten the squid in the squid launcher and there you have it.Anyway back to the review,What is really weird to me is Kalmah's feet.When I look at the picture,his feet is a normal hordika feet but when I bought this at Toys &quot;r&quot; us.His feet is a webbed hordika feet.Maybe there's something wrong with the picture,probably its only a prototype set.Ok I'm done explaning here are the Pros and Cons.

Pros:
-A nice design for a barraki
-A great facial design
-Webbed hordika feet 
-Squid Launcher really fires(If you know my instructions)

Cons:
-some tentacles can bend when in the canister.

"Carl","2009-11-20T17:05:22.84Z","What is this guy supposed to be exactly?","I'm kinda surprised actually that Pridak employed this guy to be a Barraki. Although, I'm surprised Pridak employed himself, but thats a different review. What I'm really trying to say is that Barraki are supposed to bring fear into the hearts of the Mahri Matoran, like Ehlek and Takadox and Carapar and Mantax do, but this guy just kinda looks like he took a wrong turn at Voya Nui. Seriously, if this guy had to come down, he should have just kept going until he found the fiery place.

Pros:
- Three eyes
- Mandibles
- Shoulder pads
- Feet

zyglak is a very good combo.

"Hylocera","2010-05-07T12:17:47.187Z","The Barraki are coming!","<p>&nbsp;When I got this set for my birthday, I couldn't tell what&nbsp;my friends&nbsp;had got me, because of the oddly shaped box. Anyway, I shook it and that gave it away. He's a fun guy when you wrap the tentacles around a Mahri, and the tentacles look amazingly good on him, but otherwise they're nearly impossible to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;His head, cool, and the eyes are neat. The head is also customizable (You can change the color of his lower teeth and the ""bulbs"" LEGO used fore his eyes), and works great for a villian. The only thing I dislike are the teeth of his lower jaw, they are too common and come in the usual white, but its cool how they make him look more evil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The armor was unusual back when it was released, usually the $9.99 figures had four armor plates, not six. It's also double colored, making it a little harder to use than if it was only red or black. I was also&nbsp;surprised by his ""backwards body"" as I called it before, because I had never seen it used like this before. Later they would be much more common when the Matoran+Toa feature came out a couple years later on the Phantoka/Mistika/Makuta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;His&nbsp;tentacle things&nbsp;were neat, though once he was a pile of spare pieces the tentacles weren't&nbsp;just a mite hard to use. His squid launcher was the worst launcher made by LEGO (After the Nynrah Ghost and Cordak Blasters), though if you&nbsp;practiced a lot it worked better, unlike the Cordak and Nynrah Ghost blasters, which didn't seem to care about your skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Overall, he's not so great, I'd personally prefer Takadox or Ehlek, but if you're thinking about making&nbsp;a villian and not a Rahi, don't get Ehlek and get Kalmah. He's the most evil-looking of the Barraki. Pridak looks too much like a bird =P. 3/5</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3
"PaulTR","2010-12-24T09:43:15.713Z","The Poster Boy Barraki","<p>I got this set for my birthday a few years back, and was pleasently surprised at how great a set Kalmah is. While some of the other Barraki may seem like better deals,&nbsp;don't pass up this great set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kalmah looks very nice. With his giant tentacle and ""Republic Red"" coloring (sorry, don't know what to call it), Kalmah presents an accurate resemblence to a&nbsp;squid. Interestingly, there are portions of his head and armor that are blended slightly&nbsp;black;&nbsp;it doesn't show up in the stock photo of him.&nbsp;It looks very good on him, and doesn't make him seem like some stark,&nbsp;two-colored toned freak. Another&nbsp;great thing about&nbsp;Kalmah is his three eyes, which makes him a unique set; I think (with my limited knowledge)&nbsp;the only other set with three eyes is the Piraka Reidak. However, Kalmah does have some issues: he's a a pretty conservative Bionicle, with no armor on his chest.&nbsp;He also lacks the&nbsp;interesting body of Pridak or Mantax. As another downside, his head juts out&nbsp;very far over his body, making him seem like he's sticking his head out like a turtle. But this is just a minor thing:&nbsp;it doesn't bother&nbsp;you when you view him from the&nbsp;front.&nbsp;Overall, Kalmah is a good-looking, if some-what typical,&nbsp;dude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kalmah was a fun, if somewhat, standard Bionicle build. He is constrcted kind of like a Piraka, which is not really a bad thing. As an interesting point,&nbsp;his armor pieces are connected to his legs and arms with rods instead of axels, making his armor plates seamlessly&nbsp;move when pressed against each other.&nbsp;Its a great&nbsp;design, and won't make his armor rub against each other. His head, like the other Barraki, is well constructed and cleverly designed. In general, Kalmah&nbsp;was a routine build,&nbsp;and probably won't blow your mind. His pieces are awesome, with some excellent armor pieces,&nbsp;tentacles, and jaws. MOCers will really&nbsp;dig his sweet armor pieces, as you get 6 (count&nbsp;em!) of them, enough to make an articulated worm or something (just shooting out ideas;)&nbsp;As a cool extra, Kalmah features a re-designed foot, with spread out extensions on his feet, making him very stable. His squid are nifty little rubber creatures, and they look, and feel, really cool.&nbsp;As for the tentacles, they are pretty fun; however, they&nbsp;are not very bendy, and he has no other weapons,&nbsp;making Kalmah seem a little under-armed compared to other Barraki&nbsp;(""Pridak has, like, 5 knives and all I get is this dumb, stiff,&nbsp;tentacle!""-Kalmah).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kalmah is also a fun to play with. You can clack his jaws, stiffly wrap his tentacles around stuff, and ""shoot"" his squid launcher; so much&nbsp;has been written on the&nbsp;lameness of the squid launchers, I won't bore you.&nbsp;Kalmah does not include any&nbsp;gears or&nbsp;extras (discounting the extra squid), so you older, gear-loving Bionicle fans may be put out. I, however, am&nbsp;a newer Bionicle fan, so his lack of gears&nbsp;doesn't bother me.&nbsp;Where&nbsp;Kalmah (and really, all the Barraki) shines the brightest is poseability: He looks great in just about any pose, and you can get his tentacles to wrap around the head of some poor Matoran. And&nbsp;if you have the other Barraki, he adds a bit of spice with that flaming orange tentacle of his. As for the $9.99 price tag,&nbsp;I think he's well priced, considering he's not a clone and you get plenty of new pieces.&nbsp;Ahh, but&nbsp;as usual, I'm rambling! Lets&nbsp;see if Kalmah makes the cut:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Looks&nbsp;great 
<li>-Has some really nice pieces 
<li>-Is unique (No clones! Yay!) 
<li>-Poseable and fun to play with</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Build plays it safe 
<li>-Squid launcher (Grhhh!) 
<li>-Jutting head 
<li>-No gears</li></ul>
<p>So, did Kalmah pass the inspection? YES! While other Barraki have more unique builds (Mantax, Pridak) and others may have more extras (Takadox glows in the dark), Kalmah is&nbsp;a solid set. I like to think of&nbsp;Kalmah&nbsp;as the&nbsp;swauve, level-headed,&nbsp;and sophisticated Barraki&nbsp;who plays it safe, and doesn't make mistakes some of the other Barraki do (Pridak's build&nbsp;and Mantax's boring color&nbsp;come to mind).&nbsp;If you have the other Barraki, don't hesitate to buy him; he looks simply stunning with the other ""Creeps from the Deep"" and his three-eyed gaze will&nbsp;be sure to put a smile on your face :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
