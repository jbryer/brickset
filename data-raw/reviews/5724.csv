"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-19T15:22:35.437Z","Great Fun","I was initially skeptical about Carapar, and didn't think he was all cracked up to be. But when I got him and put him together, I immediately put him under the best set of the year candidates (just something I do). 

The building of this guy is straightforward, but fun. Especially when it comes to the  beautifully colored armor pieces, and the slickest head I've ever seen. The claw is easily the star of the set. It is well designed, and really looks good. The Squid launcher. . . 'nother story. I am not fond of these launchers or there ammo. The ammo does not stay in the launcher unless you want it positioned at an extremely awkward angle, and it doesn't launch squid well, either. But if your like me, you'll just recognize this and throw them in his canister for storage. Playing with this guy is also pretty fun, no doubt about that. Overall, I a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarkLordMakuta","2007-07-23T22:09:48.15Z","Carapar","Carapar is the least exciting of the Barraki in my opinion. His construction leaves a lot to be desired, his claw is cool looking, but it's very loose-fitting, and his armour is cool, very cockroach-like. The squid launcher still stinks. I only recommend him to avid BIONICLE fans, such as myself.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-29T20:36:57.577Z","awsome, one of my favorite bionicles","this guy rocks, his upper arms and legs have some armor on them to make him looks strong, and his lower arms and legs have well chosen peices. his claws rock and they look realy cool, his feet i dont like, there rakshie feet and are to plain for me. his head is nice, and the sideways teethe are cool looking. the squid launcher is TERIBLE, but, ive come to accept that, i new what i was getting so i didnt mark him down a level for it. his chest peice is cool and the sides are semi-transparent. i would recomend this bionicle to anyone who likes them",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-11T13:37:22.043Z","Crab warlord","Good set, in overall, but they can be maked a better form to the claw. The head is great, with a incomplete mouth. The teeth are three, and the armor is awesome. He isn't brown like other sets were before the yellow in some bionicles, but the painting is cool. The squid launcher, like the cordak, launchs sometimes easy, sometimes hard. The combination with ehlek and mantax is very good. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 24 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>This set has a lot of good and useful parts in it which are very useful for future MOC's (My Own Creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. This figure also has a lot of brown/yellow pieces which are really hard to find - especially the head.<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very fun and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8918-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p><p><span>The arms, the hands, the legs, the feet and the head can be moved. On one hand you can see a launcher which doesn't shoot really well and the other hand you'll find a claw which can be opened and/or closed very easily. I really like this figure - even the design which LEGO used for the armor. <br></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"PaulTR","2010-12-28T14:49:40.043Z","One of the Best Barraki!","<p>Carapar was the last Barraki that&nbsp;I purchased, and I had high hopes for him. Thankfully, Carapar lived up to my expectations, and no doubt will live up to yours as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right away, you can tell Carapar means buisness. His head, armor, and massive claw due an excellent job of mimicing&nbsp;an armored&nbsp;crab. This is further enhanced by his stubby feet and&nbsp;sand colored&nbsp;pieces. I love Carapar's look, and I think he is one of the best looking Barraki.&nbsp;I have only&nbsp;2 complaints with Carapar's body: One,&nbsp;there is no armor on his back, which makes him seem very weak&nbsp;when viewed from his back. Secondly, there is no armor&nbsp;on his lower stomach, making him seem a tad bit too skinny. But this is&nbsp;only a minor issue, and the lack of armor actually improves his movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to&nbsp;the build!&nbsp;Carapar was a fun, if some what simple,&nbsp;villian to build. He is constructed in pretty much the same way as a&nbsp;Piraka, except his head&nbsp;is much more interesting to put together. I especially like how the Mantax shoulder armor piece is used to cover up his chest. Overall, Carapar was easy to construct, and while fun to make, isn't very challenging.&nbsp;BUT! Not to fear! Carapar's&nbsp;parts&nbsp;make up for his lackluster build:&nbsp;he includes tons of useful pieces, including jaws, new armor, re-colored Inika legs, and&nbsp;2 very&nbsp;cool looking claws. And if you manage to&nbsp;buy another pair of Carapar's claws, you can&nbsp;give him TWO graspers, making him a true crab!&nbsp;As a&nbsp;side note, Carapar's head&nbsp;makes a fantastic Star Wars Rancor monster head, which is a blessing for&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;Star Wars fans. So rejoice, Bonicle (and Star Wars!)&nbsp;MOCers! Carapar's got the goods!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carapar is&nbsp;tons of fun to play with. You can clack his jaws, move his claws, and shoot his squid launcher.&nbsp;As a plus, Carapar is the only Barraki with a moving weapon, so&nbsp;old-school gear fans will be at least a little&nbsp;happy. I can't tell you how much fun it is to hold a Matoran in his claws and&nbsp;then&nbsp;throw&nbsp;it into a group of Toa.&nbsp;However, there&nbsp;are a few downsides with his playability: Carapar's squid launcher is almost impossible&nbsp;to shoot. I think the squid launcher is one&nbsp;the bigger Bionicle mistakes, along with the ridiculous price hike in the 2008 model year. However, as I've said in previous reviews, I like the concept, and if LEGO had put a little bit more planning into it, I think it would have&nbsp;been a cool weapon. Another&nbsp;slight letdown is that Carapar's claws do not close together;&nbsp;one&nbsp;is fixed in place above the other one. But this is just a minor quibble of mine; besides,&nbsp;with a few extra pieces, you can make a&nbsp;simple mod to make the claws&nbsp;meet. All in all, Carapar has the only moving weapon amongst the Barraki, so I would rate&nbsp;his playability the highest amongst them.&nbsp;As for the 9.99 US dollar price tag, I think Carapar&nbsp;is well worth it.&nbsp;After all, you won't find a clone Carapar set amongst the Barraki. Now, lets see if&nbsp;Carapar makes the cut!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Looks&nbsp;dangerous and big&nbsp;(just like a Barraki should:) 
<li>-Sturdily built 
<li>-Unique and useful pieces 
<li>-A moving weapon! 
<li>-Well worth the price</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Lack of armor on his back and torso 
<li>-Typical build 
<li>-Squid launcher&nbsp;difficult to fire 
<li>-Claws don't meet together</li></ul>
<p>So, should you get Carapar? Definitely! Even if you are not going to get the entire Barraki lineup, I would still say get Carapar; he's that cool!</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
