"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-14T20:02:52.84Z","Wonderfully Impressive","Let me just get out of the way that as soon as I saw the final canistar art for each set, I knew Mantax was going to be one of the best. Now, with three Barraki notched into the belt (Pridak, Mantax, Carapar), I have to say this is so far one of the better ones. 

The canistar is awesome. It's a nifty transparent blue, and slopes to the right a bit. The base/lid is a nice black color with some grey streaks mixed in. The cover art is also very nice, containing an armored Mantax with a ferocious glance. But I didn't buy the set just for the can. :)

The build for this set is one of the more unique builds for a canistar set yet. The body utilizes a Toa Inika body, part of a Rahkshi body, and numerous connectors. Now this may not sound impressive, but the result is very [impressive]. It gives the shoulder/neck area a very nice flat look to it, very ray-like. The big shoulder plates are also a nice addition, looking very similar to the wings on your earth rays. Same with the tentacle/tail thing sticking out the back (although it's too high to be a tail)

There are a few unique pieces for this set, the best example being the feet, which are one of a kind. They slightly resemble the Toa Metru (I believe) design, but are more bulked up. The next would be the shoulder armor, which are big, and could be used as armor on other sets, like Carapar. There is also the claw, which uses something Lego hasn't done yet as far as piece movement goes. They are flexible, but not so flexible that when bent they stay bent. It's very cool, and allows for claw movement with no other moving parts. 

Playability is also high. This Barraki has an angry look on his face, which plays the villain role perfectly. The set doesn't have so many points of articulation that it flails around, but enough to make it have many (11 to be exact) points of articulation, and still be stable enough for even the most aggressive players.

Mantax is defiantly one of the best Barraki, and if you only get one, this is the one I recommend. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarkLordMakuta","2007-07-23T22:14:30.227Z","Mantax","Overall, Mantax is a pretty cool set, and a very unique build. The only downsides are the fact that he is a tad... empty... in the midsection, his &quot;stubby arm&quot;, and that horrible squid launcher. His upper body is really quite cool, particularly his head and shoulder armour, and I like his tail and claws. Mantax is a pretty good buy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

His claws aren't really special and his shoulders are cool with a mixture of black and white.His squid often fall out their holders but I don''t really care. The squid launcher is useless since the squid don't even fall off when I try to launch them. Great set for those who like bionicle.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The mouth claws are the same of all barraki. The claws of his hand are great, a good thing to use as titan's fingers, or horns, very usable. The feet are cool, big as the  mahri Nuparu's feet. The armors and the red spikes makes this set looks more creeper than any barraki. His face have a cool painting and design. He also have a squid launcher.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"PaulTR","2010-12-27T18:08:41.54Z","A Beastly Barraki With an Attitude!","<p>Mantax was the first Barrraki I bought, and because of this,&nbsp;he is now sitting in the middle of&nbsp;my Bionicle shelf. With his unique weapons, interesting build, and cool looking&nbsp;face,&nbsp;Mantax puts new meaning&nbsp;into the word ""Creeps from the Deep!""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mantax is a mean and sinister looking set. With his hunched over body, spiked head, and&nbsp;tail, Mantax is a fascinating looking Barraki, which is saying something considering how unique each one of them is.&nbsp;He exudes a&nbsp;stealthy and scary vibe, which is perfect considering he is&nbsp;based off the shy,&nbsp;dangerous&nbsp;sting ray. I also like how the designers&nbsp;included some red spike pieces to add a hint of&nbsp;color to an otherwise&nbsp;mostly&nbsp;black set. His&nbsp;weapon also looks&nbsp;appropriately scary; however, I do wish the designers had chosen a more&nbsp;individualized weapon, considering Carapar also has a claw, which is much more suited to him because he's base off&nbsp;of a&nbsp;crab. Maybe a spiked spear, representing a stingray's&nbsp;barbed tail, would have been&nbsp;cooler (Hey, I'm just shooting ideas out there:)&nbsp;My only other&nbsp;complaint with&nbsp;Mantax&nbsp;is that he looks&nbsp;like he doesn't have a head&nbsp;when viewed&nbsp;from the side. This is&nbsp;because his shoulder armor is very high, and his head is very low. However, its not a big issue. So, in the looks department, Mantax is (mostly)&nbsp;fantastic, and I&nbsp;doubt you'll dislike him because he looks too freakish or odd (Pridak's face, anyone?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mantax has one of&nbsp;most interesting&nbsp;builds of the Barraki, or just about any cannister set, for that matter.&nbsp;Mantax is constructed using a sloped Technic&nbsp;piece attached to 2 torso pieces; one is used for his&nbsp;upper body, while the other&nbsp;is used for his torso (sorry, I know it sounds confusing ;) This&nbsp;gives the impression that Mantax is a hunched over undersea creature.&nbsp;The whole structure is even more amazing when you consider&nbsp;it has to support a full-length LEGO&nbsp;tail, Mantax's large head, AND his two huge shoulder armor pieces.&nbsp;It is also very sturdy,&nbsp;which is a&nbsp;major plus. And weapons! Wow! Matax is the most heavily armed Barraki, with his pincers, squid launcher, head spike, and tail.&nbsp;And&nbsp;as far as parts go, Mantax won't let you down:&nbsp;new shoulder armor, pincer weapon pieces, all-new feet, and a&nbsp;nasty-looking face. Add that to his useful&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;tail and spike pieces,&nbsp;Mantax's parts will&nbsp;put a smile on any MOCer's face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, while&nbsp;Mantax has all these great features, there is a major point where he stumbles: playability. Mantax is probably the least&nbsp;""playable"" and poseable Barraki.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;Mantax's shoulder armor is so large, he can't really raise his hands that high. Another&nbsp;disapointing&nbsp;thing about Mantax is his pincer: while it looks suitably violent, it&nbsp;can't open or&nbsp;close. Now,&nbsp;don't think I'm a&nbsp;stickler for moving weapons; I just think&nbsp;the stock&nbsp;picture&nbsp;of Mantax&nbsp;is misleading, because it looks like he has a moving weapon.&nbsp;To add to the misery, Mantax's squid launcher is very hard to shoot.&nbsp;That's a bummer, because it seems like a good concept. But maybe&nbsp;I'm making him seem like an un-playable Bionicle; you can still make him crouch and jump on Matoran in ambush situations (""Hey, did you see tha-OOF!""-Matoran), and he can (kind of) move his tail back and forth.&nbsp;However, Mantax has painful&nbsp;issues&nbsp;with poseability:&nbsp;since he is meant to&nbsp;be hunched over, straightening his legs makes him look like a 6-foot tall hunchback, which is not a&nbsp;good thing&nbsp;for a Bionical villian. Also, his head is VERY limited in movement, which is another (obvious)&nbsp;bad thing.&nbsp;However, there is an important plus&nbsp;about Mantax&nbsp;(*sigh of relief from prospective buyers*): I believe he is well priced at $9.99 US dollars, because he is sooooo much more unique than previous Bionicle villians (no more&nbsp;waves of&nbsp;clones! Yay!)&nbsp;Now then, let's check out the facts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Looks amazing, and is very unique 
<li>-Excellently&nbsp;built and designed 
<li>-Lots of new&nbsp;pieces 
<li>-Well priced 
<li>-Heavily armed (head spikes, pincers, squid launcher, tail. Let's face it,&nbsp;he's a walking armory!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Head a little low 
<li>-Pincers don't move:( 
<li>-Least playable Barraki 
<li>-Poseability potential&nbsp;is low 
<li>-Squid launcher is lousy</li></ul>
<p>The verdict? Well, this is where&nbsp;personal preference comes in. If your just looking to buy one Barraki from the 2007 year, I wouldn't advise Mantax. However, if your a Bionicle fan, this set is a great buy. Sure, Mantax has issues, but doesn't every set? The fact is, he&nbsp;is beastly, loaded with weapons, and looks stunning with the other Barraki. Buy him when you can!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
"bionicle212","2011-04-26T10:54:40.72Z","am I the only one who doesn't hate the squid launcher?","<p>why does everyone hate the squid launcher? anyway :) mantax has a realy... unique build. it's definitly better than cloning, but whenever you put on the head, the inika body part comes off.it's a minor issue however.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>unique build. 
<li>evil looking manta face. 
<li>cool weapons like the squid launcher, and the claw.(which can snap!)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>body falls apart easily. 
<li>those little piraka minifig spines keep falling off.</li></ul>
<p>overall, a great set! so unless you're broke, go on ebay and get this set!</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,5
