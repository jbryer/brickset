"Blade","2007-07-06T05:14:43.607Z","A reminder of the good old days...","I picked this one to be my first of the six to buy as from the packet looked the wickedest and my girlfriend could relate to it. (looks like some creature from Harry Potter i think)It really re minds me of the old school enemy's of the toa. i unfortunately have missed allot of story line due to my absence from this hobby but if its a mutation of something its not bad.

Compared to older sets the skeletal structure looks very week except for the head and hands. the back spikes are cool, but from the front appear to be not even dangerous. Also i would like to point out for a set new out of the box the joints are very flimsy in the legs. weather this is due to too much top end weight or what i dont know but i have seen allot tighter.

The squid gun is lame a good concept but needs so much more work i intend to read up on how to actually fire this properly as on the model or in my hand it sucked. 

The claws, well personally the almost make up for the gun. the look dangerous and deadly. Also love the face looks realistic.

Overall I give this an 7/10 There have been better but have been worse. A nice addition to the set if you like em.

Bad Stuff:

Bad fire function.

He has awesome spikes which resemble a porcupine and is bent down which is pretty creepy.  The squid shooter is horrible!  But his head is one of the coolest ever!

"Carl","2009-11-20T16:58:25.09Z","EHLEK-TRIC! (excuse the pun)","Ehlek is the best of the Barraki. He has a unique build, sort of similair to Takadox, and has electric spines on his back. Awesome!

Pros:
- Head is great for MOCing
- Claws
- Electric spines
- Piraka feet
- Mandibles
- Unique build
- Nice choice of limbs
- Little armour makes him look agile

Cons:
- Squid launcher (MAJOR CON!)

Although the squid launcher is really bad and I said that it was a major con you can just take it off and adjust the squid-launcher-holding-claw slightly so he just has two claws.

Right now Ehlek is holding up Toa Mahri Nuparu and giving him some good old EHLEK-TRIC shocks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's nice to see something new. Ehlek's limbs don't have any armor, but that works to his advantage, as it gives him a cool skinny look.<br>He has pieces that are great for MOCing, like the the dark green Toa Metru legs, the talons and the spines.<br>He looks better without the squid launcher on, and you can also modify his left hand so that the talons are attached like on the right hand.<br>If you like Bionicle, I recommend you buy Ehlek if you can find him.<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"PaulTR","2010-12-27T12:47:03.56Z","An Essential Barraki!","<p>I bought Ehlek (along with&nbsp;Carapar)&nbsp;during&nbsp;a ""2-for-the-price-of-1"" deal on Amazon. I&nbsp;was hoping Ehlek would be a good set. Instead, what I got was an amazing set!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, Ehlek is&nbsp;a very cool looking&nbsp;guy.&nbsp;With his Protosteel claws,&nbsp;green coloring, and&nbsp;electric spikes, Ehlek&nbsp;(in my humble opinion) is one of the better looking Barraki.&nbsp;I really like the sort&nbsp;of ""spindly"" look the designers gave him, as&nbsp;it makes him look like a&nbsp;dangerous, slippery eel. His&nbsp;claws fit perfectly in with his look,&nbsp;and his back spines are fantastic;&nbsp;they are probably the best-looking part of him. My only complaint with Ehlek is his lack of armor: he doesn't have a single piece&nbsp;of protection anywhere, besides his back spikes. However, I&nbsp;don't think this is a major issue, because&nbsp;the lack of armor gives him a sleeker, more organic look. However, I think it would have been nice if at least a&nbsp;few pieces of unique armor had been thrown in.&nbsp;All in all, Ehlek looks&nbsp;great, and is probably&nbsp;one of the best looking Barraki, along with Carapar, Takadox, and Mantax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ehlek&nbsp;was a fun and unique build. His entire body is composed of&nbsp;a bent green piece attached to&nbsp;2 torso pieces, each one&nbsp;making up his torso and shoulders. His 3&nbsp;spines are attached to these 2 pieces, and are bent in a nice shape to give&nbsp;Ehlek a&nbsp;back.&nbsp;I really liked Ehlek's build, and it is probably&nbsp;one of the more unique builds of the&nbsp;Barraki line up. Surprisingly for a Barraki,&nbsp;Ehlek's included pieces are not&nbsp;all that great: the only&nbsp;truly individualized&nbsp;pieces are his spikes, head, and claws.&nbsp;This is because he has no&nbsp;new armor pieces like Mantax or Kalmah (Kalmah alone has SIX unique armor pieces.) Also, while his&nbsp;light green pieces&nbsp;look fabulous,&nbsp;there are reports that they break. I&nbsp;haven't had any problems so far&nbsp;(I have owned Ehlek for years and&nbsp;play with&nbsp;him regularly) but its something to keep in mind. So, hats off to Ehlek's build, but the included pieces, while great for MOCers, are not as cool as some other Barraki :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ehlek is really fun to play with.&nbsp;You can click his&nbsp;jaws, make him swipe his claws (*thunk* ""Whoops! Sorry Matoran!"") and (try to)&nbsp;shoot his squid launcher. A cool thing&nbsp;Ehlek can do is&nbsp;use his claws as feet, making&nbsp;him&nbsp;crawl on all fours.&nbsp;As for the squid launcher, its&nbsp;horrible. However, I&nbsp;like the concept, and if LEGO had done a little more planning, I think it would have been&nbsp;a great launcher.&nbsp;Whatever the case, Ehlek (like Takadox and Pridak) looks better without&nbsp;it on.&nbsp;Another downside is Ehlek has no ""action"" features. Boo.&nbsp;But&nbsp;as for poseability, Ehlek is amazing. You can make him pose in all sorts of great shapes, and he looks really sinister&nbsp;next to his fellow&nbsp;Barraki, especially Carapar. Now, as for the&nbsp;$9.99&nbsp;US dollar price tag, I think&nbsp;Ehlek is well-priced. Yes, the Piraka had glow in the dark skulls, laser eyes,&nbsp;Zamor launchers, ect, and cost only $8.99 US dollars. However, they were all&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;much built in the same way&nbsp;and lacked starkly different personalities (In the Bionicle universe, they had one mood: angry). Yes, I'm sad they hiked the price, but I think the design differences the Barraki&nbsp;have from each other really pays off. After all, Bionicle is not how many many features you can jam in a set; its about how&nbsp;cleverly the sets are designed, built, and look.&nbsp;Well, I've said my peace!&nbsp;Lets hit the list!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-One of the best looking Barraki 
<li>-Fun and unique build 
<li>-Great weapons and spines 
<li>-Sturdy and fun to play with 
<li>-Poseable</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Not&nbsp;many new pieces 
<li>-Lack of armor 
<li>-Quality of green&nbsp;pieces is in question 
<li>-Squid launcher a no-go</li></ul>
<p>The verdict?&nbsp;Find Ehlek some where at an affordable price, and buy him. While he may have his faults (and what Barraki, or Bionicle set for that matter, doesn't?),&nbsp;Ehlek has got to be one of the best Barraki you can buy.&nbsp;Find him, buy him, and have fun; just watch out for those awesome spines of his&nbsp;;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,4

	I got this set on the Easter of 2007 from the bunny himself, and find this set to be all right, but it is greatly flawed when compared to other Bionicle sets, especially other Barraki.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		The spikes have a sense of villainy in them.</li>
	<li>
		The pincers on Ehlek are also a nice addition to this otherwise bland set.</li>

<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		There is absolutely no armor on this guy, and it shows around the torso, arms, and legs...a lot. This guy needs to take my diet of fried chicken and salad (dressing).</li>
	<li>
		Lego got bored with weapons, and thus decided to include two of those blade-things, as well as a dysfunctional squid launcher.</li>

	This set is all right for younger kids, but is disappointing for me, a hardcore fan of Bionicle. If you want it, get it, but have either a lot of armor or a really small price offered to you.</p>
