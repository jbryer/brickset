"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-02-24T01:19:06.293Z","Even Sharks Have Their Faults","Right off the bat, Pridak comes down to the set that is the least attractive. Why? Because he possesses marks that were designed to be blood - something we were told before would never be seen in Bionicle due to a no violence policy. But I did gives this set a chance before putting it on the poor list. 

The canistar for this set is pretty retro, as are all the Barraki canistars. It's an attractive transparent blue color with bubbles and cracks on it, really giving you an underwater feel. The lid is also a gray rock with lines of blue, similar to the lines of gray you see on marble. It also has a decently attractive picture of Pridak, really making the guy look mean and nasty. The back of the set shows the faces of the other Barraki, and displays the primary function of the squid launcher.

The build of the set is pretty strait forward, but can get sort of awkward with the waist articulation (more on that later). When you finish, you get a pretty cool Pridak, who even comes with a dorsal fin, and two quite long feet that may have use for a hidden feature. More on that later.

This set is pretty good, and it would be very good, had it not two faults: the squid launcher and the waist articulation. The squid launcher makes fighting with the weapon really awkward, so you have to remove it and reposition the weapon. The weapons themselves are pretty good, and can seemingly be used as either jabbing devices, or even wrist/arm blades of sorts. Sort of dual action. The waist articulation is what killed it for me. While it's a good start to what should be a good feature, it makes the set sort of flail around some, and if you don't pay close attention, you could be position your Pridak horribly wrong. But it is a good start.

Remember that hidden feature I was talking about? Well if you fold Pridak arms this-a-way, and his legs and feet that-a-way, you can actually have something that resembles a shark, just without fins on the tail or a pointed nose. It's fairly nifty, and I don't know if it was intentional or not on Lego's part.

Overall, this set isn't the best of the Barraki. It has some faults, mainly around the wist articulation, that could have been improved upon.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"DarkLordMakuta","2007-07-23T22:28:47.113Z","Pridak","Pridak is my favourite Barraki, hands-down. He brings something new and much-needed to the table- waist articulation. His blades are sweet, as are the bloodstains. Pridak is one vicious-looking warlord! His feet are actually much cooler than I had thought at first. I also modified his arms to make them symmetrical, but it's not neccesary. An excellent set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Mandables
cool teeth
cool blades

cons:
Squid launcher doesn't fire
lower body section twists
lower arm sections twists

I think this set is a bit disappointing, with the squid launcher 3/5

you can combine it with kalmah and takadox to make zyglak. If you want to get zyglak I'll just do a tiny review of him:

zyglak is a very good combo.

Pros:
cool teeth
cool claws

Cons:
Bad colour scheme
rubbery tentacle

zyglak is the best combo yet 4/5",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Okay, so my brother bought Pridak and I bought Carapar. Now I am extremely glad that I bought the Barraki I did. Because this guy does not look like he knows what hes doing. He has sort of a vacant expression that looks weird and his feet are disgustingly long. Okay, so his blades are a little cool but that aboimination of a projectile weapon the squid launcher does not shoot at all. And considering that the last projectile weapon we had was the Zamor sphere launcher, this one is a huge let down.

His build is unique and the extra blade on his back makes him look cool from behind. But as soon as you turn him around, ""what an abomination"". 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"PaulTR","2010-12-24T15:44:50.92Z","The Bad-Boy Barraki Leader","<p>I bought this set for Christmas a few years ago. I had read&nbsp;many&nbsp;negative reviews pertaining to Pridak, but I decided to give him a chance.&nbsp;After I got him, I realized that while&nbsp;Pridak does have a few issues,&nbsp;he's still a great set, and a worthy&nbsp;leader of the&nbsp;Barraki.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off,&nbsp;Pridak isn't a&nbsp;wimpy looking&nbsp;Bionicle set. Far from it, in fact!&nbsp;Covered in knives, swords, and that sinister red coloring, Pridak looks like he means buisness. He is probably the meanest looking Bionicle ever made, and his nasty looking face only adds to his fierceness. Even his feet, which are&nbsp;actually quite sharp, evoke a dangerous presence.&nbsp;As for his red coloring, I think it adds a stark contrast to his shark-white pieces, which is a good thing. I know, I know; many people say it's blood, and that LEGO went too far; however,&nbsp;I'm not here to get involved in&nbsp;that debate. I personally think it looks good on Pridak. However, I know some may find it disturbing, and I understand where they're coming from.&nbsp;The only other&nbsp;bad thing, as far as looks go,&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;Pridak's&nbsp;face: while it definitely looks mean, to some it may seem bug-eyed and comical. For me, it fits in with his personality&nbsp;in the story: he's a calm, cool leader one moment, and the next, he's going crazy with rage.&nbsp;Honestly, while some may disagree, I think Pridak looks excellent, and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect leader for the Barraki.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pridak's build is definetly exciting. He is not your typical Bionicle cannister set, as he has a 360 degree spinning torso, a first for Bionicle I do believe (don't quote me on that, though;) Another great thing about his build is how his back fin (or sword) is connected to his intricate body. And the pieces! Wow! You get&nbsp;FIVE weapons, two new feet, and lots of&nbsp;useful older&nbsp;pieces. The swords are great pieces,&nbsp;and the long feet are sure to make MOCers happy;&nbsp;if you stick them together with some extra pieces, it makes a mask (Kahrzani! *sorry, probably didn't spell it right*)&nbsp;For a set with the lowest piece count (47)&nbsp;of the Barraki, you actually get a pretty good deal. However, MOCers might turn up there noses at the red on the swords, as they don't look very good with anything but other white parts. All in all, Pridak has one of the best and most unique builds of the Barraki. Score one for the shark-boy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pridak is a&nbsp;fun guy to play with. With his swords and articulated body, you can swing him back and forth like a deadly scythe. It's fun to clonk a Toa figure in the face with his swords, and then watch them fly. Weeeh! (Yeah, I'm still an 8-year old kid at heart;)&nbsp;As a plus, his body can be considered an action feature&nbsp;(sort of) so you old-school gear-happy Bionicle fans will rejoice. As a downside, however, his squid launcher is a pain to fire. So much has already&nbsp;been written about the squid launchers that I'll just say this: I really, really like the concept, but the&nbsp;ease of use&nbsp;is very poor. Also, his articulated body, while fun, makes him less stable than the other Barraki. On the other hand, Pridak is a knockout in the poseability dept: With the extra point of movement, you can make Pridak&nbsp;look&nbsp;frightening, contemplative, and even&nbsp;turn him&nbsp;into a swimming pose&nbsp;by turning his body completely around.&nbsp;If you want&nbsp;to pose&nbsp;Pridak,&nbsp;you've got nothing to worry about. Now, as for the price of $9.99 US dollars, I think this is a fair deal, considering the uniqueness of each Barraki. I think LEGO really hit a home run with the uniqueness of the Barraki and Toa&nbsp;Mahri; it removes the 'clone' feeling Bionicle has had for many years.&nbsp;Now don't get me wrong, I&nbsp;LOVE all of the old-school Toa and bad-guys; I just think&nbsp;the unique designs are a&nbsp;cool and creative new twist. So, in the end, while the Barraki (and the Mahri) may not have as many&nbsp;action features of previous years, they are still worth the price, in my humble opinion. But enough talk! Let's tally up the pros and cons!</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Nasty looking (in a good way!) 
<li>-Fun and unique build 
<li>-Great pieces 
<li>-Fun to play with 
<li>-Poseable and unique 
<li>-Extra point of articulation</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Might seem a bit&nbsp;too freakish 
<li>-Red coloring might weird people out 
<li>-Swords&nbsp;are not a single, uniform&nbsp;color 
<li>-Less stable than other Barraki 
<li>-Squid launcher (need I say more?) 
<li>-Least amount of pieces out of the Barraki</li></ul>
<p>Overall, I think Pridak is a great set.&nbsp;Sure, he's kind of frightening and he's&nbsp;a little less stable than other sets, but that doesn't mean you should get him. Although he's not my favorite Barraki, I still think his pros easily&nbsp;outweigh his cons.&nbsp;If you like Bionicles, I think you should&nbsp;check him out; however, if you are looking to collect all the Barraki, don't miss out on him! After all, he is their&nbsp;crazy,&nbsp;five-knive holding, bug-eyed, waist&nbsp;articulated boss! :)<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
