"Blade","2007-07-31T11:16:16.677Z","Matoran I","Picked this guy up in a toy sale last week and he really is a treat. The Green is colour of this model is very foresty and another great one of colour. His overall structure is very sturdy, flexible, poseable and aesthetically pleasing. 

His joints are nice and firm so dont worry about over use and the ball launcher has some wicked force behind it. The blade arms look cool and dangerous.

Nice sturdy feet with a well armoured chest plate really enhance the features of this model also. 

The only let down was his eyes, no colour just plain clear.

Over all I give this guy a 7/10 well constructed and great playability. A nice addition to any collector. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Nattyd31","2007-12-27T18:07:55.92Z","Boring!","this small set is really cool but has nothing special abut it. If you really want a matoran for 2007 get the other one its more unique.


pros- mask, silver

cons- Small, zamor, eyeless, reused pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-03T22:33:16.73Z","Nice Matoran","Defilak is the same build as Dekar only looks better in green. The Hordika chest plate is used again as this guys chest plate and Toa Iruinis mask is re-coloured green for extra awesomeness. The silver feet are cool and the Mahri Matoran blades are really great for MOCs. The Mahri Matoran and Mahri Rahi were the last Bionicles ever to use the Zamor sphere launcher, so that is pretty cool but sad at the same time seeing as the Zamor sphere launcher is one of the best projectile launchers ever made by Bionicle producers.

Defilak is really cool and is a definite must have for Bionicle fans and non-Bionicle fans alike.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-04T15:21:00.357Z","Defilak, le-matoran of mahri nui","The defilak matoran is cool, with more systems than the 08' matoran, with cool colors and weapons a little body with a great armor. The dark green, black and silver are great. His mask is the same of iruini, in other color. The air bubble launcher is the same sphere launcher, used in 06' and hydruka. He don' have eyes, like the 06'matoran. Is different comparing with hydruka, but looks like very dekar.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bionicle101","2008-07-08T13:17:15.967Z","cool","I got this set for Christmas along with Dekar and the hydruka. Defilak is obviously the best because of his color scheme &amp; a Toa Iruni mask. The only problem is his feet. I hate toa metru feet the way I. J. hates snakes! But he goes well with the Mahri Nui collection, even though there should at least be 3 hydruka and 3 matoran.

"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-22T12:59:18.013Z","my second matoran of 2007","A very good set. This was my second matoran of 2007. Defilak has a solified air bubble launcher and that is strange because Matoran don't normally have a launcher.

pros:
cool blades
cool mask
solified air bubble launcher really fires

cons:
no eyes

I think this set is really cool 4/5

"1_for_Legos","2008-12-16T18:32:51.36Z","AWSOME!","A super cool set. Includs zamor launcher (bubble gun) Toa Metru feet, Toa Hordika body piece, and a cool Kanohi mask. A good set for a Matoran lover (like me). Kinda cheep for thirty-seven pieces though, but I'm not complaining :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
