"greg_duncan","2007-07-17T17:53:53.87Z","One of the best matoran","Dekar is probably one of the coolest and most fun to play with matoran sets made to this date. The shoulder mounted zamor launcher is sturdy and good, and the parts aren’t too bad at all. 

I mean, you can build him with parts from other sets, but the mask and tools really make the set anyway, seeing as they are the only parts exclusive to this set. The yellow mask is really a good part for MOCers. I highly recommend this set, as I can’t find any faults with it. Check out my profile!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-07-31T10:55:25.723Z","Matoran II","Picked this guy up in a toy sale last week and he really is a treat. The colour not being my favourite colour ever dose wonders for this one of model. (Note the similarity to the Holden Monaro Yellow). His overall structure is very sturdy, flexible, poseable and aesthetically pleasing. 

His joints are nice and firm so dont worry about over use and the ball launcher has some wicked force behind it. The blade arms look cool and dangerous.

The only let down was his eyes, no colour just plain clear.

Over all I give this guy a 7/10 well constructed and great playability. A nice addition to any collector. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I also think the blades look sweet! The silver feet are a cool edition to anyone's bionicle colection! I just love those Zamor Spheres! The mask is awesome! Good price!

"Gus_263","2008-03-04T17:03:12Z","Dekar as matoran","This set was released on the begin of 07', one of the coolest, have a scheme of black and yellow. Like Defilak, he have a mask also used in toa hagah. The weapons are named electro blades. Good, for matorans like this. He don't have any eye piece, but have a sphere launcher, named as air bubble launcher, because he is underwater. This is the matoran form of dekar, because he was later transformed in hydraxon by the mask of life. He don't have my favorite color, brown, but is awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-22T05:29:14.187Z","my first matoran of 2007","A very good set. This was my first matoran of 2007. Dekar has a solified air bubble launcher and that is strange because Matoran don't normally have a launcher.

pros:
cool blades
cool mask
solified air bubble launcher really fires

cons:
no eyes

I think this set is really cool 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-03T22:38:02.09Z","THAT BLASTED TURAGA DUME MASK!","Honestly! When a mask is repeatedly used three times it gets so annoying! Except this time its been given a scruffy yellow paint job instead of a scruffy silver paint job. Like Defilak, Dekar has the old Hordika chest plate whcih is really cool and the Bohrok legs coloured yellow (in Defilak they are dark green). The super old arm pieces are black rather than Defilaks dark green ones and the Mahri Matoran blades along with those silver hook fangs make for great MOCing pieces. The Zamor sphere is great as in the Piraka and the feet of Dekar are cool. But to me Defilak is more colourful and I like colourful Bionicles so Dekar gets a 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T16:33:46.67Z","Got Him From That Friend Of Mine...","He's a nice set for his price (my price was a Lego Star Wars Vulture Droid lol).  The shoulder mounted air bubble launcher is neat and the swords make him look like an explorer and fighter.  He is very posable and playable, and makes a good recruit to any Bionicle collection.

Pros:

-Electro-swords

-Shoulder-mounted air bubble launcher

-Posable

-Playable

Cons:

-Arms can be hard to pose sometimes

Great Matoran!!  Seriously, think about getting him.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
