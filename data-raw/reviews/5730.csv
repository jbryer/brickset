Pros:

-A very well-design rahi
-zamo-um I mean Solidified air bubbles can really fire

Cons:

-No new pieces
-A recycled zamor launcher
-hard to pose because of the H design of the rahi

Overall: 3(5/10)A nice hydruka look but with recycled pieces its actually a downfall.At least its only a cheap price so whether you buy it or not.It's up to you.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-28T16:57:13.89Z","The red Hydruka","The Hydruka of 2007 are good builted, but small and with no mask. Thulox have a awesome color combination and a nice building. This set is not much playable, but it have reasons to be not much playable, because Thulox is a a rahi. The mouth is an feature that the Hydruka Morak also have, and the mouth do a good effect on the set. The tail is like the legs not playable but it have an sphere launcher, that works very well and do the set be more cool to play with. Unfortunately, this set do not have a great feature, mask and good playability (yes, it is a rahi, but some small sets are more playable). Due to this, i rate Thulox overall 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-22T13:16:05.357Z","my second hydruka","A very good set. This was my second hydruka. thulox has a solified air bubble launcher and that is strange because small sets don't normally have a launcher.

pros:
cool teeth
cool mask
solified air bubble launcher really fires

cons:
no eyes

I think this set is really cool 4/5

"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T16:30:01Z","Great Rahi!!","I got Thulox to go with Morak, and I wasn't disappointed!  He is actually dual colored, his frontside being red and his backside being black.  The tail-mounted air bubble launcher is a nice touch, as well as the teeth.  He is very posable and playable.  Pros and Cons:

Pros:

-Dual-colored

-Teeth

-Air bubble launcher (Zamor launcher)

-Posable

-Playable

Cons:

-None!!

Thulox is a good buy!!  Great set!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Thulox looks cool, but the build is boring. The zamor sphere shooter is cool and I like the teeth.

Pros: Zamor sphere shooter
Teeth
Moving limbs
Double color

Cons:
boring build
