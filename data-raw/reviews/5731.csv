"legozander","2007-04-02T13:30:22.193Z","Excellent. :)","About time Lego did a decent Rahi set. I really like this little guy. I really like the body and head and the glow in the dark armour is cool. I like the head design a lot because it is an improvement over the Rahkshi and Rahagas heads. Also the Nuparu claw as sort of teeth is cool as well. :) The zamor launcher on the tail is a nice addition and is fun to mess about with. However I would recomend putting a stopper on top. Overall 5/5.(By the way brickset I like your new site.) :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-02-28T17:04:37.997Z","Good glow in the dark feature","Morak, like Thulox is not much playable, due to the rahi form, is also small, and have an good form to build, also to build the mouth, that do a good effect. The tail uses a sphere launcher that works very good and have an nice sphere colors. But the best feature of Morak is the color combination, the different blues and the glow in the dark piece that do another awesome effect. This set, like Thulox, have more cool features but the same playability of a small rahi. I rate this hydruka in overall 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Carl","2009-11-03T22:43:35.78Z","Great Underwater Rahi","As with the Mahri Matoran, I picked a favourite Mahri Rahi: and Morak is it.

Morak sort of reminds me of a down-graded Takadox because of its transperant blue connectors, dark blue Visorak feet and glow in the dark armour piece.

The Zamor sphere, sadly, we will not be seeing again although the Midak skyblaster is sort of similair but not completely similair. I like the bottom jaw that is attached to the Rahkshi head and the Zamor tail is cool.

Overall a neat little Rahi that is really cool for making Rahi attack scenes.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-23T05:46:00.03Z","my first hydruka","A very good set. This was my first hydruka. morak has a solified air bubble launcher and that is strange because small sets don't normally have a launcher.

pros:
cool teeth
cool mask
solified air bubble launcher really fires

cons:
no eyes

I think this set is really cool 4/5

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-13T10:23:19.9Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Matoran) - Morak Review","<p>This is a fun little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has 16 pages and there're no mistakes in the instruction.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some really cool pieces. One of them glows in the dark. All pieces we get are great for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers to put on.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/8932-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p>The legs and the head of this little figure can be moves. You can also adjust the tail which has a nice catapult launcher. I really like the design of this little figure - even if it doesn't have many play features.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"flarefish","2014-11-27T17:49:13.8Z","Glow in da dark/ Blue translucent.","<p>Morak&nbsp;has really nice blue translucent connector pieces, I did think there would be a few more but it is still epic, he also has&nbsp;a zamor&nbsp;sphere launcher as a tail. Morak has a glow in the dark piece which is used to cover the connector&nbsp;pieces keeping him together, just to say this is the only Armour&nbsp;piece, it also has a little red spike which is not really needed but is cool. Morak&nbsp;has a clawed foot as a lower jaw and a darker shade of blue on a rahkshi&nbsp;head as the head( DUH a head as a head I&nbsp;cant believe I just said that). Morak also has a really cool fang like claw foot, a single claw but still a claw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros&nbsp;</p>

<p>glow in the dark part.</p>

<p>translucent blue&nbsp;connector&nbsp;parts.</p>

<p>Zamor&nbsp;sphere shooter tail.</p>

<p>Small desktop toy( Of supreme doom and epicness! Oh did i say that i just meant cool desktop&nbsp;toy).</p>

<p>Claw foot.</p>

<p>Claw mouth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Legs wobble a LOT.</p>

<p>If held upside down the zamor sphere dang falls out, ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My rating out of ten is 8 out of ten.</p>
