"Widdi","2007-02-17T18:24:22.17Z","Parts Pack","This set is a nice parts pack, especially for smaller bits. There are three vehicles: A small car, with the latest mini racer design, a Monster Truck, which is nicely looking for it's small size. And the Truck with trailer. The Monster Truck chassis is attached on the truck after disassembling the wheels.. But without stickers it's rather boring looking. Overall 4/5, because of the many useful bits you get with this medium set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"bmwlego","2007-11-18T09:38:54.093Z","Racers Tiny Turbos Set  Good but Not Good Enough for a 5","Night Crusher set 8134 is a nice entry to the Racers Tiny Turbos theme. The color scheme works for me and the stickers really make the set look great but they are stickers! The Monster Truck is a great scale. The wheels are raised by attaching bricks to the undercarriage of the truck and placing the wheels to the bottom of the brick. The huge wheels also raise the truck off the ground enabling it to crush the yellow racer. The trailer cab is similar to the Road Hero which I gave a 5 in an earlier review and this cab is a little different but looks just as good. The Monster Truck and cab both score a 5.  
Now on to the negatives. The small racer car looks as plain as can be. This car would not sell as a stand alone set. It is way too plain and simple. It does have 8 1x3 slopes that make up the windshields of the car which is a plus but the car is way too plain. The truck trailer accommodates the Monster Truck once you remove the wheels and this is a cool feature but this looks funny and the tiny racer car must not make it through 1 Monster Truck Jam show because there is no room for this car on the trailer. The tiny ramps included are a nice touch too. I guess LEGO wouldn't be able to make a Racers scale model that would have enough room in the trailer to fit a car and a monster truck. This would be a cool mod though.
As other reviewers have stated that this set is a great source of smaller parts and I agree. This set is also a great source for Dark Stone colored parts.
Pretty much the sole reason for me grading this set a 4 instead of a 5 is the simple racer car. It is too simple and plain. Maybe a wing in the back and better stickers would have helped raise this score. The stickers for the windshield cover parts of all 8 1x3 bricks so if you want to reuse these parts you have to decide to either lose the sticker by peeling it off of the bricks or lose the bricks because you don't want to peel the sticker off! Or not use the stickers in the first place in which case the plain car becomes even more plain.

"Psymon","2011-02-21T12:22:51.32Z","I think people are missing the point.","This set is excellent, I really like what they've done with the truck and trailer, however I believe the other reviewers are missing the point of the yellow car included in this set. It's not very detailed and is really basic build because well, you wouldn't crush a brand new car with a monster truck. There is also no room for the car on the trailer because you wouldn't carry a crushed car around with you, you crush it, you get rid of it, you find another.

Overall this set deserves 5/5 it's everything it promised to be.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
