"bmwlego","2007-11-17T15:53:40.577Z","Night Driver","Much like the Raceway Rider (8130), this set's main design is not as striking as others in my opinion. There are many excellent parts included however that help this set score a 3. The cheese slopes, engine brick, mudguards, windshield parts, etc) are all great parts. The stickers are quite plain and don't add much to the overall appearance of the car. This car is a little longer (2 studs?) than most other Tiny Turbos and it is a completely different look than other TT's which also helps this set's score. I combined the parts from this set and 8133 to see how many different cars could be built from these two sets. I built close to 20 and decided that the possibilities were endless!

The only real reason this set stands out is because it is not bombarded with decals and stickers and such, and is not really a tuner, racer, or off-roader like basicvally all the other cars that exist. The car really does look like some extremely rich dude's limo/sport car. The engine piece on the front is not supposed to bean engine, but rather a chrome hood to make the black/silver contrast more interesting. What's more (and I bet Lego didn't even notice this) but the area where the window and hood meet, the little slot opening makes a tiny slot in front of the window, much like many cars in order to &quot;open&quot; the hood. The front end looks very nice, and the sitcker adds to the coolness (although it is a flipped version of the F6 Truck's cockpit top) and Lego even managed to put a spiler in the car. It's pretty nice overall.

Negatives

When you build this car, it looks less impressive than it does on the box. First off, the side bumpers don't touch the ground like most other cars, making the sides look like it has a roll of flab. There is no rear bumper. The mudguards are simply open at the back, allowing you to see the wheels, which is not a good thing. And the cool looking blue tinge to the car? Lego made that an effect to avoid making the car look on the box like it was pictured in black and white, which when you build it, it does. That's the only big problem I have with the car.

If you're looking for a nice luxo-sport car, this is the lego car for you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-16T13:31:25.763Z","Good for a mini sized Lego car","This is one of the Tiny Turbos, a subtheme from the Racers theme. This is like the other Tiny turbos, a well made car but in small sie, so, don't includes minifigures. The design, color scheme and easy building (easy due to the size and pieces, but the result is good), makes alongside with the playability, another cool small set. In comparison with other Tiny turbos, it still good. The wheels are small but in a good size for it, and the front of this Tiny turbo is well made, using pieces with different shapes, and color schemes, making it better. The back still well made, and with a good position, to the &quot;cockpit&quot; (not exactly, it don't have minifigures, so, the cockpit is made with bricks in some different shapes covering it completely). The building is basic, like the size. But the building still good to this small size, and the design is  awesome too, including the color schemes. This Tiny turbo is cool to play with (in comparison with sets with this size) and overall, another well made set of the Lego racers theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
