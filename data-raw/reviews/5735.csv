Positives

This is a very nice LM car, and it has some very nice pieces, including the ever-popular round 1x1 chrome pieces. It includes loads of details, including brand vinyls, purple flame vinyls (which nicely contrasts with the yellow coloring)and a huge F1 spoiler. It also has a nice cockpit, and a very accurate middle area. It also is very low to the ground and is a great addition to those super/racers that you already have. You can also make a load of things out of it, and it has immense playability (cause little kids love to play with cool F1s, in fact playing with a 1:32 version of Shumacher's Ferrari is getting close to locking in our DNA...:))

Negatives

Once you get past how cool this set is, you realize some major flaws. For one, its backside has no back bumper, so it looks broken down from the back. Second, also from the back, the spoiler looks retarded. And the sides being long means that it looks like a chunk was taken out from the rear sides, and most importantly, on the hood, you can see the wheels from the inside because the wheel covers only cover it on top, not from the sides.

All in all, if you like Tiny Turboes, you want this cool car.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The set itself is loaded with great parts (cheese slopes, 4 mudguards, black sloped windshield, white sloped bricks) that save this set from a 1. This car's rear looks silly, almost impractical. It seems like it might only move by popping a wheelie because it is so heavy looking from the rear. I don't particularly care for the yellow/magenta/white color scheme achieved by using the stickers. Much like the Tuner-X, I don't care for the magenta. I would buy this set on the cheap again for the parts but not to build this car as instructed to by the directions.

"Gus_263","2008-04-29T15:57:18.64Z","Raceway Rider","This is a tiny set, from tiny turbos subtheme. The subtheme where cars don't have driver or minifigure, but still cool once that have one pilot isn't the idea of the subtheme and the sets can't have one due to the size. This have common contents, but in diffeent building. This when completed looks like with a super sport car, and somethings like the spoiler looks like with F1 ones. The design is cool, and the colors too to the pieces, altough some of these, like the yellow were too included on tiny turbos previously, like the yelllow on TunerX. This have wheels that looks like in details with matchbox or hot wheels cars, well designed and placed under pieces in the perfect shape for the wheels (the yellow ones above the wheels with details, like the flashlights for the car). The white too is another good color, that made the pieces in this color be useful too due to be used previously in other sets. The design and shape of the car is large, and with a ramp piece as the glass, this looks like more with a super sport car. The spoiler is made with plates and bricks, to be solid, this don't helps much in the playability, but this isn't very a con, once that this can be replaced. This is a tiny set but can't deserve a tiny rate, because like many lego sets the cons can be replaced, and the contents are useful. Is too very playable. Overall rate: 5/5, like many of my reviews.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
