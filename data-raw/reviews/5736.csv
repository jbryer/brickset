"lostcarpark","2007-04-07T07:37:34.787Z","Great part kit","I have quite a few of the mini racers, and some of them are fantastic part kits, as well as being excellent models in their own right. There are lots of good parts like cheesers and 1x3 curved slopes, brackets and wings. Some of the more specialised parts like mudguards and the windscreen piece might not have so many uses, but can often be incorporated into models in interesting ways. For me, the lime cheesers are just what I needed for a train I'm building.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-17T16:09:40.543Z","Lime Green Parts!","What a great source for lime green parts! This car looks pretty cool as well. The neat use of the lightsaber staff at the rear of the car is a nice touch. The stickers not only stand out (unlike the stickers from set 8132-Night Driver) but they look great as well. The lime green mudguards, cheesers and tiles help raise the score along with the black 4x3 wedge and 1x3 curved slopes. These sets are great to purchase multiples of because of the low cost and rare parts and in this case the rare colors as well. I wonder why the designer left the studs showing on the side of the car? Why not include a 1x4 lime green tile instead of the 1x2's there?

I combined the parts from this set and the 8132 Night Driver set to make multiple Tiny Turbos simultaneously while only using the pieces included in these sets. Please take a look at them in my Brickshelf gallery.

This car is overall nice, as Lego finally figured out a trick with the bumper parts, enabling the front pieces on the car look like it's blended in with the front end. The engine in the back looks nice, but it should've been chrome. It isn't overloaded with stickers like other cars, and offers a unique insight on racer building.

Negatives

Why does the world call this Rally Rider if on the box it clearly is called Rally Runner. Why have two sets side by side almost meaning the same thing (Raceway Rider) Aside from the name error, my only complaint is that I can't tell where the driver would sit if it were real. Does he sit in the little hole and let the 150 km per hour winds rip his face off his skull or does he sit in the comfort of the cockpit while the wind dips into the hole in the window piece?

If you're not concerned about my two problems, only one of which relates to the car itself, you should definitely buy this set. It's more thoughtfully structured out than all the other cars in this line-up, and has no mudguard holes like Raceway Rider. In my opinion, based on building sanity, my list from best to worst would be this:

1: Rally Runner
2: Terrain Crusher
3: Raceway Rider
4: Night Driver

Sorry ND fans, but Night Driver's construction is just horrible. If you desperately wanted only one '07 TT, get this one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-30T14:56:51.7Z","Green Tiny Turbo","Until 2006, was rare some lime green pieces, but after the 2006 year, many sets included them, being bionicle, mars mission, exo-force and others, like the creator set mythical creatures, from 2006. From 2007, this tiny turbo too included. 

From a subtheme with very playable cars, the set Rally Rider(or rally runner), isn't different in playability. This have too pieces that were already putted on other tiny turbos, like the pieces above the wheels with the curve shape. The design of the car is good, due to the ramp piece on the front and the shape of the piece to looks like with the glass car. These two pieces have too a different scheme of the green color. The wheels too are good positioned due to the pieces above and have a place of one wheel to other where can be putted plates, bricks or too ramp pieces. Have too good details, and don't need flashlights pieces due to the details of these and the ramp piece in the front to keep the design. Have too a common plate as spoiler on the back of the vehicle and too claw pieces with another ones above the spoiler keeping the same height of the car. 

The contents are useful, to make combinations, another types of building, and too for other themes, like city, or also creator. All the things that can frustrates the playability can be replaced, and don't have why don't put in this a good rate. The playability is great to make races and tricks with the set altough don't have playability with minifigures(this don't have minifigures because have one isn't the idea of the subtheme). Overall: this like the others tiny turbos is a great set, better with more of the same subtheme, to make races. Deserves a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"spyder38","2008-08-16T17:28:30.903Z","nice","this set is little, but packs a lot of detail. unfortunately, the detail is all stickers. WHY LEGO, WHY! however, there are some nice rare colored green slopes, and plates. all of a sudden, i feel like everything is okay, even with stickers. great addition to any lego collector and my first tiny turbo. comes with nice wheels too. (the four is because of stickers, but who would want it to be printed on and ruin those nice green slopes. i give it a 4.5)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
