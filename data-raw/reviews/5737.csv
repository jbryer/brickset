Positives

What's not to like about this baby? It looks like an actual monster truck, complete with the same kind of wheel positioning, a roof scoop, a truck-like back, and even a spoiler! Plus, it has super cool decals (unfortunately, all are stickers) including a racers logo for the spoiler, numbers on the windows, a decal on top of the scoop plus a sticker that looks like the scoop is a scoop, and coolish decals on the sides and hood that look like it has mud all over it!! It also has a nice collection of pieces (for those part collectors out there)and the cool curves on the box art ARE ACTUALLY THERE! Oh, did I mention that it looks sweet?

Negatives

The worst part is not the huge clunky window piece that is most of the upper part. It is the fact that unlike most Tiny Turboes, it cannot fit into it's little garage, so it is parked outside. (However, it makes a perfect garage for Baja Blaster, which is that yellow off-roader in the Bullet Run) If you do wish it to be in a garage, then you must take off the antenna and the roof scoop. But for the most part, there isn't many negatives about this car.

All in all, it is a nice addition to the tiny turbo line-up, and is bound to be used in many off-road races.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This set stands out because it is not a small car but a Monster Truck. The color scheme works perfectly as do the stickers. The sloped and curvy pieces are great additions to my parts collection. Too bad there wasn't at least one more red sloped brick on the roof, this would have been great. How many gray rims do I need? Why not make them red? 
Overall this is a great addition to my Tiny Turbos collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-29T15:41:16.03Z","Off-Road Tiny Turbo","Tiny like the other sets from the subtheme named Tiny turbos, this can't carry or be drived by any minifigure of a pilot, due to the small building. Don't a con, because this set have the idea to don't be drived by any minifigure, like the racers from 2001, only drived by different ones. This set have too the special pieces for a small car. Next, some of the contents of the set:

 With the perfect shape for the car(but don't very for other lego themes), this set have too pieces on the front with designs of flashlights for the car, that still useful on racers, specially in the new ones. A piece placed on the front of the common black ones (to make the glass for the vehicle) is too useful due to it's previous uses, like in knights' kingdom or exo-force theme. A spoiler too is included, to make a good sportive design to this off-road. A ramp piece above the black piece don't looks like with the design of the car, but don't frustrates. The pieces on back, on the front and too above the wheels are good designed and placed to make the car run well and keeping a space between the wheels to them.
 
Overall, this set have useful parts, compatible to combinations, another types of building and receiving a solid building. And the playability too, to make the set run wells, and too tricks with this tiny car. My rate to this set is 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rifraphy","2008-11-20T15:00:57.09Z","One of the few off-road TTs, and a good one!","My first review! I think this set is very good, but It has some faults. I'll tell you about them in a sec - I want to tell you that I love how it rolls, and the tough, off-roady feeling of it. It looks like a Dakar rally truck. Here are the pros (::) and (;;) cons:

:: Great wheels for a Tiny Turbo. 
:: Nice stickers. 
:: It's Red!

;; Stickers are a bit annoying when putting on. 
;; Medium stock of parts. 
;; A bit ugly.... But cute, at the same time. 

Well, overall, I'd give this a 4/5 as this little car is a very good one, but with a little weird... ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
