What I like about this set is that you can move the legs, so if you want to make stopmotions with it. They use only solid bricks, not transparent. A free animal, a good thing, 'cause it can scare minifigs if you want to make a stopmotion (hahahahahahahahaha).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-23T14:14:05.34Z","Animal Set","I got this with the Daily Mirror. It comes in a plastic bag with fold-out instructions. It advertises Cool Convertibles and Fast Flyers on the back.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The dog looks mean, just like any other dog I've ever met in my life (they hate me.)<br></li><li>-The Brown and sand colors are a match made in heaven. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-The use of axles is nice, but it looks a bit strange. <br></li><li>-The tail had no thought process whatsoever. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This is a&nbsp; very nicely made dog, which are easy to obtain and cheap to get. I would buy many for that special animal lover.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,5
