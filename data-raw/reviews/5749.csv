"bmwlego","2007-12-01T10:29:12.03Z","Solid Cement Mixer","I received this set as part of my Brickmaster subscription. This cement truck is excellent. It is a tiny set but it has detail. The mixer in the back is held together by a Technic axle and it is on an angle because it is attached to the truck using plates with handles and tiles with clips. The 1x2 translucent clear brick makes a great windshield and the grill looks great built using 1x2 grill plates. For a tiny set, this set was a pleasant surprise. It would fit in well with the 4915 Mini Construction Creator set. Some of the Brickmaster sets disappoint (I received sets that were in stores this year-aren't they supposed to be exclusive sets?) but this set is a cool addition to my collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It looks nice but the exhaust at both side and the mixer at the back drops off quite easily

Instructions are simple and easy enough for my 3yr old kid to build, with my help",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
