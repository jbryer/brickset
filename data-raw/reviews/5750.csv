I recommend this one for those with the barraki, nocturn, or the love of rubber.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-02-25T12:05:00.86Z","No much cool","The squids like all the other bionicle packs do not have much pieces, but some like the disc or mask packs are more good to buy than these squids. The color of the squids are basically identic and the squid launcher is not included (the squid launcher also do not shoot very well). The seven squids are not utile like the masks, and i think that it is not good to buy if you have the barraki, because one barraki set includes two squids. I rate the squid ammo 3/5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"james3426","2009-10-26T20:49:34.717Z","Not Good","This set has major problems. First of all, sea squid should not have been a pack, because: These are the hardest projectiles to shoot; this pack should have included a squid launcher; the last problem is, they are not much of something to collect, as they are considered collectibles. The only thing interesting here is the rare color.

pros:
color

cons:
Hard to fire.

What? collectibles?

Should have included a squid launcher.

Only get this if you are good at using squid launchers and you already have, or are getting something with a squid launcher.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"xboxtravis7992","2015-11-21T21:50:36.653Z","The End of Bionicle Collectibles ","<p>When Bionicle started of in 2001, Lego released collectible mask packs for the figures; allowing fans to purchase Kanohi or Krana in a randomly packed box: similar to today&#39;s Collectible Minifigures. That lasted until 2004, when Lego started shifting Bionicle Collectibles away from masks and towards ammunition! 2004 introduced us to the Kanoka disks; glow in the dark collectible disks with numbers which identified their rarity. Despite this promising start, the collectibles began to take a turn for the worst; hitting rock bottom with these guys: Squid Ammo</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lets face it, the Squid Ammo looked like some sort of Bricklink&nbsp;purchase. This set is literally the same rubbery piece repeated 7 times in the box. The squid pieces in this box came in Blue and Green colors; contrasting with the Yellow and Orange squids found with the canister sets from 2007. So what can you build with these parts? NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. They have zero connection points to Lego or Technic bricks. While the tail can be shoved into what Bricklink calls a &quot;Bar 1L with Clip Mechanical Claw&quot;&nbsp;the connection between them is horrible. The squid launcher which was included with the Barraki sets was ineffective, and could barely shoot the squid ammo; not to mention the launcher was not included with this set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It is sad looking at this set and thinking that this is what marked the end of Bionicle&#39;s collectible impulse buy sets. This set is overall horrible, no build, the parts aren&#39;t that useful, and with only two colors included in this set there isn&#39;t a lot to be collected.&nbsp;I wish that the Kanohi/Krana/Kraata type collectibles had continued until the line&#39;s end in 2010; but instead we got to see the collectibles degrade into, well this... &nbsp;I am glad Lego has returned the collectible aspect of Bionicle in 2015 with the new series of golden masks, even if they are not randomly packaged like the Kanohi of old; they are still a lot more collectible&nbsp;than some cheap rubber squid!</p>
