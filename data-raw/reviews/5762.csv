"Gus_263","2008-06-25T16:58:33.687Z","If you compare this as a small set, maybe...","This set is another small promotional set released in 2006 with the Bionicle theme. As a promotional, of course this set is too small, but for a promotional, it have a decent building, and works very well, nothing wrong with the building, but this is more useful to make your creations (increase with this set). 

The legs are really small, and made by few pieces, but all the pieces are much useful to any Bionicle set, and in movements it have nothing wrong, is basic in playability, like in the size. The body is very &quot;thin&quot;, using a piece like the shape of the hordika's foot, as the main piece of the body. The arms are basic like the arms of the metru nui matorans, and are playable for a small set like this. The building in the back is creative for a small, not for a big set, but to this type of promotionals, it was an innovation. The head is well fixed at the body, altough don't feature any glow piece as the eyes, and also, the rahaga bomonga's head (black piece) is a good choice.

The color scheme (black, yellow and gray) is great. This set have the name of bad guy, but anyone can use it as another small Bionicle, not a bad or good guy, there is no problem with the colors, very nice and useful, currently the yellow color isn't rare, so it is much useful. The spinner launcher is well positioned, altough don't looks like to be, it fires very well, and is too useful to any Bionicle since it was released with several of the 2005 sets.

Overall, as a mini set, this set have no much special, but features a good building for the size and of course, all the pieces are useful. If you want to get more pieces but not paying much, this is a good choice by the same price or less of the impulse sets. The small size makes it looks like incomplete, but isn't for a small set.

"ThoughtLash","2015-08-04T21:22:49.62Z","The 2006 Rahaga","<p>I got this guy on eBay a couple years ago. For ease of writing, instead of calling him &quot;QUICK Bad Guy Yellow&quot; he will be known as &quot;2006 Rahaga.&quot;</p>

<h3><font face=""Rockwell"">Box/Instructions</font></h3>

<p>The &quot;Rahaga&quot;&nbsp;comes in a simple polybag, the same as most other promotional/very small/micro sets. His instructions are nicely printed and folded into a tight square.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&quot;Rahaga&quot; features very few parts, most of which can be found in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8755-1/Keetongu"">http://brickset.com/sets/8755-1/Keetongu</a>. He features a Rhotuka spinner, as used in 2005 (with a few 2006 sets), and a Rahkshi/Rahaga head.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigs, although the completed model is about 3x the size of one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple, just assembling the limbs and clipping them together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When completed, the &quot;Rahaga&quot; is a small set about the size of a 2006 Matoran. His Rhotuka spinner is mounted above his head, and the piece used to launch it is carried as a sword.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this set to BIONICLE collectors and/or fans.</p>
