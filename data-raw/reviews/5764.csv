"Deinonychus","2007-01-12T22:11:39Z","LEGO Dweller of the Dark Depths","If H. P. Lovecraft collected LEGO sets, the new Barraki and their minion, Nocturn here, would be right up his alley. Nocturn is a sort of pseudo-Titan set in that he’s slightly larger then a canister set (checking in with 114 pieces), but not quite as complicated as the boxed Titans. In the US he sells for around $15, which is right in-between the $10 canisters and the $20 boxes. 
Getting right down to the set itself, the parts are primarily lime green or a translucent blue shot through with the familiar greenish-white glow-in-the-dark plastic. Black and gray Technic structures help flesh other pieces of his anatomy, and silver weapons round out the pieces. The parts that make up Nocturn draw mostly from Toa Metru, Inika, and Piraka sets with a few new Barraki pieces included. (Most notably different colored versions of Carapar’s head, Ehlek’s spines, Kalmah’s tentacle, and a Polyp launcher.)
Building Nocturn is about what you’d expect for a set nestled in where he seems to be for his price-point. Slightly more satisfying to build then the quickie canisters, Nocturn has enough steps and interesting connections to keep any Bionicle fan entertained for several minutes. 
The finished figure stands only slightly taller then one of the Barraki, which is primarily due to his head being mounted seemingly in the middle of his torso for that sort of “neckless brute” look. Compared to some of the other Titans, he’s about the same size as Makuta, Krekka, or Axxon, yet quite a bit shorter then Sidorak, Roodaka, or Brutaka. He has an impressive 21 points of articulation, mostly due to his six limbs. The multiple limbs can get in the way a little during posing, but with the numerous movement joints, most poses are easy to attain. 
The overall look of the finished figure is very nice, and the pictures on the box and online really don’t do him justice. He’s pointy, and menacing in all the right places, and the deep blue that has been “masked” over the glow-in-the-dark pieces help greatly to pull the coloring together as a whole, especially when contrasted with the lime green, a color that rarely looks slick on any set. 
For MOCers the set doesn’t really offer a lot in the way of truly outstanding pieces, but for the price it can be a decent parts set. 
Overall a very nice set. Probably closer to a score of 4.5 instead of just 4 really. If you like the Barraki, chances are you’ll like Nocturn.

"Gus_263","2008-03-04T15:13:26.437Z","A strong warrior","He can be the ehlek's lieutenant in the story, but i think that ehlek must be your lieutenant, he looks more strong and armored. His features are some glow in the dark pieces, the spines, the carapar head and translucent blue also included in matoro inika and takadox. Colors are awesome, black, and also lime green that don't broke off. The claw on his mouth is cool, compatible with a carapar's head. He also have a silver tentacle, squid launcher, and two air katana, one in each of his four hands in his four arms. He is tall and too strong, option for combination and playbility.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2008-10-14T13:33:13Z","Nocturn, warrior of the deep","I got this in Tescos for &#163;15. Surprisingly, I got Dekar and Thulox free with it.
Story info: Nocturn was banished to the Pit ages ago, until the Great Cataclysm occured, shattering the cells of the Pit and setting the prisoners free. Then, Nocturn teamed up with Ehlek and became a luitenant in his army.

Pros:
Spine, head and shoulder/knee armour glow in the dark
Swords
Tentacle
Stands up well

Cons:
Pipes sticking out of his legs look wierd
Squid Launcher doesn't work.

Overall, 4/5

"legoguy_3000_","2008-09-24T07:11:14.81Z","Squid launcher doesn't fire","A very good set but the squid launcher is just a big piece of rubber, and the same with the squid. 

Pros:
blades

Cons:
squid launcher doesn't fire
Rubbery spines
rubbery tentacle

I think this set is a bit disappointing, with the squid launcher 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
