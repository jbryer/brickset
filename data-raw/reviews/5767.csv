"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-15T22:13:10.25Z","Arguably the best Lego Castle...","Definitely a 10/10 from me. This is a very commendable product and have lotsa playability. Though there were a couple minor flaws, the pros way outweigh cons...

Pros:
-Finally the castle design of the 80's is back, improved with newer pieces and colors!
-Just like the older castle sets, a high-level of playability 
-Nearly a 1000pcs.
-Nice &amp; realistic grey, dark blue &amp; solid gold color scheme.
-Lion-head pcs and the chained drawbridge makes the gate looks somewhat grand.
-Mini-catapults on front two towers works well to keep invaders off the gate.
-The number and positioning of the torches provides a very nice touch to the castle.
-Decent number of minifigs in sets throughout the series (unlike KK1 &amp; KK2).
-Very realistic bodies, helmets &amp; armor design (even King's looks a a tabard worn over his gold armor).
-Individual faces (not a must, but a good addition)
-New skeletons, esp their leader from 7009, very cool-looking.
-Nice dragon, hope this design becomes the new basic Lego dragon (previous ones were way too small).
-New &amp; realistic-looking weapons.
-For me, it works perfectly as a gatehouse with its backdoor leading to a palace (King Leo's Castle) =)

Cons:
-Erm hrm, 1 horse?
-No device or mechanism to lift the portcullis.
-With no doors or ladder leading to it, prison-like room on the right tower seems to be of no purpose (and from the location, the prisoners could pee all over your soldiers while they are fighting).

Imho:
-The skeleton legion needs a siege weapon! (battering ram will be great for the castle's collaspable side wall)
-WOW-themed but good job. Haha, will be goodif we have someone else except the necromancer to lead the undead. =P

High level of playability &amp; customisation, together with realism and value for money.
I'll recommend this to every castle collector or even Lego lover.

I like the dragon better than I thought when I bought the set. The colours on the castle are great to. There is also a new sice round shield. And the thing I like most of all is the new drawbridge!
But there are some things I don't like:
The skeletons have straight arm so it doesn't look nice when they are holding weapons and the fall over because of that all the time.
Also there are the less minifigures in this set. There should be at least some more knights to defend the castle. I would also like to see some new trebuchet like siege weapons. 
The king looks great with the golden sword and crown but he needs a shield. 
There also should be a gatehouse because it looks stupid when the gate is up.
Overal lego is doing a good job, but with the next castle should come some inprovements before I give it a 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

castle/fortress:

this is kinda like a huge citadel. it has a breakable wall, a drawbridge and a gate! it has a walkway around the wall that makes it stand out from other castles. the palace actualy looks decent. it has a throne room and kindof a treauser room. it has walkways connecting to another tower and has guard posts every where. the main gate has 2 towers to pcik off intruders who come to close. the citadel has a catapult or two to attack.

figs/ dragons:

the dragon is a large beast that has a good scale  to the castle.

"Nased","2007-09-12T04:27:07.797Z","Fantastic Castle, even better than my Vladek's Dark Fortress","It's a wonderful castle. There are sufficient weapons for both the good army and the evil skeleton army. The sheer size of the castle is majestic and I like the design of everything. I don't need to mention the number of knights and skeletons since the previous comments have explicitly indicated them. However, I am a LEGO lover and I certainly do hope that there would be 2-3 more figurines. It would be best if there are one more knight, one more axe soldier and one more white skeleton. I think that would make the set more exciting.

Apart from that ,I am ok with this new concept with a hollow right in the centre. However, I would love it more if the centre is filled with a base plate or something that the knights can be fitted on. That would make the castle a more &quot;condusive&quot; place for the good guys to live in. I think the skeleton commander is scary and awesome. I will give it a full marks. The dragon is cute and I like it as much as the beasts from the Viking set. The castle itself is very nicely design. 

I collect LEGO and this castle series is definitely one of the best, if not the best since the first castle came out. I will collect the whole set by end of this year. It's worth the money and space in your house to display the entire set if you are a lego lover like me.  

For all the effort, playability, figurines and together with the smaller sets, the whole set is fantastic and I don't mind giving it a 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"kurttkrueger","2008-05-02T04:11:37.187Z","One of the best Castles to date...","Well, what can I say? Picked this castle up recently, and put it together over a lazy afternoon. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience too. 

This castle is very reminiscent of the castle sets of the 80's. I'm particularily reminded of Black Falcon's Fortress (6074) of 1986, though this is clearly on a much larger scale. Its a welcome return to castle design of old, as BFF was one of my favourite castle's of my youth. While I quite liked the mountain-esque base plates of the later castles, I think the open centre design leaves room for more imaginative play. 

So, on to the pros and cons:

Pros:

Superb King figure, one of the best to date in my opinion. 

Nice selection of minifigs, with individualised faces.

No over juniorisation of pieces. A certain amount is expected, even required in some places, but overall, its a very detailed set.  

The dragon is very cool. Very big and imposing, and a definite improvement over the crocodile mutation seen in earlier years. 

A much larger castle when compared to previous sets. 

Cons:

The tower balistas/catapults are a tad on the flimsy side. 

No portcullis mechanism. Its still effective, but dissapointingly manual. 

Overall, theres not much wrong with this set. One of the best castles I've seen over the last 20 odd years. 

A 5/5 from me. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

However, I dislike the dragon in this set because it looks like it should be in another set. The interior is very nice, but the top tower should have some walls to protect the king.

"lego12","2008-05-15T16:47:54.467Z"," The skeletons are attacking wise king.....what shall we do?","
  This set is really cool and it comes with TONS of things like skeletons, knights, and a RARE King that is really hard to get.  It has a wall that can be pushed in by the skeletons to break in the castle walls or for the King to escape the invaded castle!  It also has a dragon that is pretty cool, and I REALLY like it! The flame peice on the dragon's mouth does fall off though... :( , but thats not really important. 


   The king has a golden crown and a golden sword. It comes with about EVERY Lego weapon imaginable!  It has some crossbows and some bow and arrows which are RARE!  It also has a working gate and drawbridge to keep the skeletons out! It also has 4 knights, 4 skeletons, King and more!  It has a dungeon to put the skeletons into!  To me there is NOTHING bad about this set!  It is a nice BIG set and it has A TON of playability!  


    You can change it into other castle designs, but the the castle design on the front of the box is the best out of all four designs!  In the middle it has an empty courtyard with a weapon stand and in the middle you can use your imagination to build WHATEVER you want in the center of the castle.  I built a horse shed to put my horses into.  I also built a little food market.  

     Thats my review of set #7094: King's Castle Siege an I hope you enjoyed it!

The modular nature of it makes it exponentially more fun to have, and the numerous accessories, towers, and features (like the exploding wall) make it a great one to have around. The trade off here is modular castle that can easily be customized versus a solid base castle, but with all the other features, even if you would prefer a solid base you can't deny that this set isn't a great time, interesting build, good display, fun to play with, the only possible drawback is price, but with all the pros that shouldn't bother you too much.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros-

Great castle building pieces
Lots of minifigs
Dragon
King
Cool drawbridge and portcullis
Big catapult is cool
Nice jail
Especially cool mounted knight
Lots of gold pieces
Flame stays in dragon's mouth and it can hold a person's foot

Cons-

Pans on small catapults fall out
Dragon was a little smaller than I expected
Castle is a little weak and flimsy
Piece on the bottom of the drawbridge is black-it would look better brown

"ngdere","2009-01-16T15:53:18.797Z","Nice casting","My son is 4 yo : it took ""us"" 4 days building this set.
The first built item was of cours the ddragon (Dad, may I sleep with my dragon ?)
He discovered the two faced minifig before I did, and he really enjoyed that trick.
The turning bridge was also a part of fun, and the white skeleton falled a dozen times tonight.
The breakable wall is another excellent idea.
Of course, I did not show how to throw parts using catapults...
The whole is very pretty and clever, even at the detailed focus of a child zooming eye (stickers, grass on the walls, ...)

A bit scared by the fire out of the mouth of the dragon, this item is now put on a torch, and the dragon has become nice and defends the castle against the skeleton army.

Pros : very pretty, many things to find the name and explain children, many minifigs and a special 2 faced one. Cute black/white helmed knights. A pretty success, no regret and if to redo, would be redone.

Improve suggestions : technic connectors linking main face of the castle to others are not sufficient since it turns; should have used two connectors each time a wall part is to be connected to another.
Addition of a scale for skeleton to climb the walls could be great, and of course a scale pusher and hard boiling in the hands of defenders.
A prisonner minifig, long beard, with a sphera bound to the foot (sorry about translation), would be great into the jail. A princess minifig would stimulate the dragon.

Question : what is the back side axle intended to ?

Cons if any : The system that allows the grid to fall dawn has no stop and can keep in hands.
Some specific parts could have been replaced by standard bricks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lint","2010-04-21T09:22:09.013Z","Most wonderful castle balances between design and playability!","<h4>Summary</h4><p>I picked this set up from ebay recently for a fair price. I was most impressed as the castle is well designed, fun to build, is wonderfully embellished with ornaments/accessories and has some neat playability features. The castle itself occupies about 30x35cm and is made up of six main modules which are connected by technic pegs: the portcullis, two turret towers, the catapult wall, the prison tower wall, and the kings tower wall. Populating the castle is the king, his marksman, the horsed knight, the veteran and young soldier. Assaulting the castle are two white skeletons, one black skeleton and the skeleton commander who weilds a great axe on a giant black dragon! The gimmicks on the castle work very well, both tower catapults fire a good trajectory, the larger catapult is quite ballistic and the prison tower wall has a concealed section of wall which fits snugly when it isn't being bashed down by skeletons.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Onto the pros and cons<br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">PROS</span></p><ul><li>A good build.

<li>First the front gate with drawbridge and fence, missing is a center passage where the Knights can stand. 
<li>Then you built 2 equal front towers starting with below 2 great grey/green rock parts, a good looking first floor (nice stickers on the corner wall panels) and the top with turrets and 2 small good working catapults. 
<li>Then the left wall with again a rock part in the middle with a small weapon rack on the inside and a bigger floor with turret. Here you built a good working big catapult. 
<li>Next part is the rear wall with back entrance made with 2 big black doors, missing is a beam to lock it from the inside. In the center 2 dark blue pillars and a big floor on which you build the center back tower. 
<li>After that the right wall with rear right tower and in the middle a secret escape door. First tower floor is a classic castle passage with arches, the second floor is the prison and the top floor a defense lookout post. The Castle walls can be reached by the wooden stairs. 
<li>Center tower is a modular part with on the first floor the treasure room and the King's throne on the second floor and a secret trapped passage to the right tower. Top of the tower is again a defence post. The only strange thing is that both the treasure room and the King's throne are open from behind, could have been better with a small low wall. On the left side a small tower part, a bit overdone in my opinion. Better would have been leaving that part and adding a real slope roof on the center or right tower.</li></ul>

<p>Parts 5 bricks : All very good and usefull Castle parts, with some parts I like to mention : the dark blue 2x2 round bricks, the grey 4x4 round corner pieces,&nbsp;the grey/green rock parts and the awesome dragon.&nbsp;Are there things missing ? Yes, I would have liked some of the King's &nbsp;banners on the front towers and a real flag for the top tower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : a great looking Castle with 10 minifigures and a dragon gives maximum playability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value&nbsp;4 bricks : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=7094-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average of some €110,00 for this set but that I consider a bit much for a used set. For about the same amount of money you have a new <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=10223-1"">Joust</a> or <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10193-1"">MMV</a>. I would think a price of €75,00 would be more reasonable which is the going price in the Netherlands, used of course.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
