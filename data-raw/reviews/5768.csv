"Cashcleaner","2007-08-24T15:30:00.397Z","Great exterior!","This new creator home is a cut above all others.  The exterior elements and brickwork on the corners give the kit a lot of personality.  I agree with the previous reviewer with regards to the building's interior, however.  A floor or some stairs would have been a great addition to an otherwise excellent model.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"marvinblue007","2007-08-25T01:27:38.77Z","Pretty good.....","This set looks fantastic from the outside. It builds up really well and has a lot of nice details. (I built the school option). For the price ($AU89), it would have been nice to have some interior pieces. This is the same fault with 4956. It does, however, hope to flesh out my city really well. Great to see something other than Emergency Services buildings!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brickbuilder711","2008-01-06T13:59:15.64Z","Just perfect","This set is just amazing. The houses are well detailed and perfectly done. My favorite details are the SNOT 1x2 tile techniques and the little drains. I also like the use of tan bricks and the black roof, which contrasted from past houses. The blue cars are a nice touch too. The shed is another great add-on (the main model). There are no flaws to the set. This also inspires modular building. and great value for the money too, only 70.00 for 1174 bricks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-10-20T15:12:30.187Z","Tan Bricks, Gray Tiles and Headlight Bricks a Plus!","This set is an awesome supply of tan bricks and headlight bricks. The corners are built using tiles and headlight bricks and once I learned this technique I couldn't wait to incorporate it in a MOC. When time permits, I will be using this design as I think that it looks stunning. A huge plus is the color scheme of tan and black roof pieces opposed to the same old white and red roof pieces. The car designs are cool as well. I couldn't wait to get this set once I saw images of it leaked on Brickset last year. It didn't disappoint, however it seems pricey when compared to the 4956 Creator House set. The color scheme and increased selection of pieces is a great trade off though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"TXClark","2007-12-27T22:48:38.28Z","Another great Creator set","This was one of several sets under the christmas tree, decided to build up the larger house (one on the face of the box). Lots of nice details overall. As with the 4956 House it's vacant inside. This is a nice addition to any lego city!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2008-04-19T18:35:58.92Z","Very Cool Set!  My return to LEGO ...","I collected LEGO in the 80s, but have not built them in years.  Most recently, I have helped my nephew with his Bionicles and other newer sets-- which I did not like.  Last week, I walked into the LEGO store at Disneyland.  I was instantly hooked again.

When I got home, I immediately bought some sets online.  The Model Town House was the 1st to arrive, and I built it last night.  This set is awesome!

This set has 3 different build options, and I had a hard time deciding.  1 of the options is a street scene/alternate house and it is amazing looking.  I decided to build the town house the 1st time around.  It has really nice detail and uses unique building techniques to create effects.  The car and separate garage are both great.

Pros:  Detail, Looks Great, 3 Options, Effects
Cons:  No Interior! No Minifigs!

Regardless, I love it!  I'm gonna get the beach house next and add these 2 to my 2 houses from the 80s.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Town","2010-05-14T13:25:41.53Z","Buy 4956 instead","<p>I sold this set a while ago. I&nbsp;like the other Creator house (the white set released around the same time (4956)) far more. 4956 has more fun and&nbsp;variety in the three different build options, and uses a traditional and established Lego colour scheme which I prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inclusion of the cars and truck in this set is an unwanted extra item for me, as it makes one of the problems with these Creator sets more noticeable.&nbsp;The problem is that&nbsp;people buy these houses&nbsp;to provide houses for their minifigs, yet some of the features of these sets don't fit in with the rest of the Lego Universe, making them null and void. The vehicles are too angular, too wide, and too Technic-looking for Lego City, World, and&nbsp;Town themes. They don't fit in. Added to that are the odd plants and shrubbery found in all Creator sets, and in this one the&nbsp;school build that contains weird playground equipment (which doesn't fit the minifigure scale). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something positive&nbsp;that I can say is that I liked the two houses build option. I used one of the houses&nbsp;as a traditional fire station, and the other as the Fire Marshall's house. That was cool. Lego has since released Fire Brigade (10197), which uses the same colour scheme and trumps my idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that Lego releases more minifig-oriented Creator houses&nbsp;in the future which fit in with the rest of the Universe. The Beach House Creator set was&nbsp;the perfect blend of the two for me, but I will&nbsp;always hope for a resurgence in&nbsp;strictly minifig houses.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,2

I mean what's better than that!TOILETS!All in all this is a great set with high playability and a great city builder.I give it a 10 out of 5!Great job Lego! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jgptee","2008-07-17T10:34:29.293Z","a moc waiting to happen","i bought the set and never built the model town house as provided in the instruction booklet. instead, i built a 16 by 16 base town house of the cafe corner standard so it can be connected together with my market street, green grocer and cafe corner. in the end, i was left with just 2 spare dark grey 32 by 16 base plates. lol! this set is that flexible! i would encourage all collectors of this set to try building a different town house.

if you follow the instruction to build the town house, it still looks great but it is empty inside. do not let the double-story building fool you - there is no 1st floor or any stairway leading up to it. however, you can still lift the roof off to see the emptiness inside. i wonder what for? i think this is the only drawback of a nice house of a unique architecture. other than that, i am just disappointed that the base plates are not green, but a concrete dark grey color.

go get it! :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thenaterater","2008-07-12T20:51:10.467Z","awesome set!","this set is very cool, i love the attention to detail.  the garage door opens, the flowers and shrubs, the chimney, the garbage can, the fences, the windows, and much more.  i love all three models that can be built, and i think the school is the coolest, and when you are done 
building the alternates, you have tons of pieces left so you can add. it also gives you a lot of bricks so you can build your own models which can be very cool.  i love this set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"VideoGameLord613","2008-07-19T15:02:49.983Z","I agree with Hollywoodkbl","This is a very detailed set. It has a car and a garage to put the car in!

Big
Can take out roof to put in furniture
Hours of fun!

Cons:
No interior!
No stickers!

"turtlespit","2008-10-02T18:31:23.687Z","Superb!","This is my 2nd purchase as an AFOL, having picked it up from Amazon on sale at about &#163;30.  Great value per piece, as my police station (7744) cost me &#163;50, and has less pieces.

I built the default town house, and the secondary 2 smaller houses, and loved both.  The external detailing is superb, with drainage pipes and gutters for the roof.  The recessed windows are also a great touch, and make for a more interesting build.

This set also feels like it has great flexibility building other creations, especially a modular house to slot in with a Green Grocer/Cafe Corner/Market Street set.  (Though I haven't bought any of these sets yet)

Negatives would be the lack of internals, and a lack of mini-figs, but in my opinion doesn't detract from the overall score - 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wakwak","2010-01-07T07:52:27.327Z","Huge house","While this house is the biggest of the creator lone house, it is also the bulkiest. It feels like most of the old suburban euro town houses and is very impressive in term of size. The build is very straight forward and the only intersting technics would be the offseted windows and bricked wall corners.<br>The biggest downside of the set is the lack of floors. Of course, no one is expecting a detailled interior, but some additionnal plates for making the floors would have been appreciated.<br>I recommend for all City/Town enthousiast has this house will nicely fit in your town layout.",TRUE,4,5,3,3,4
"av8r1973","2011-01-04T09:38:05.347Z","Great looking facade, not much meat!","<p>This is a great looking house!&nbsp; It really is a ""model"" home.&nbsp; The exterior is very Eastern-US or Euro suburban and goes really well with some of the other creator homes and even the modular kits (Fire Brigade and Grand Emporium).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we have been building up our City infrastructure, we neglected the 'burbs.&nbsp; This kit is a perfect addition.&nbsp; So far, we only built the main model.&nbsp; The nicely built 6-lug wide car actually fits in the garage.&nbsp; It's a bit bigger than other City vehicles, but not out of place.&nbsp; Considering it's a Creator kit and not City, that's acceptable.&nbsp; The brickwork along the corners and the gutter pipes are a nice touch.&nbsp; Lots of roof pieces and fence pieces. Since Minifigs still work well with the kit, we are using it as the start to our own suburb next to the farm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that great looking exterior and fully functioning garage fall short on interior details.&nbsp; Actually, there isn't any interior.&nbsp; Not just no furniture, but no walls and no floor!&nbsp; This really limits playability.&nbsp; Sorry, LEGO, but LEGO was made to play with!</p>
<p><br/>A simple fix would be to add a simple ledge around the perimeter of the house on the inside that you could build a floor onto.&nbsp; Then the walls and furnishings.&nbsp; It's big enough inside, but lacks structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have ordered a few more of the Creator homes to continue to neighborhood, but this is certainly the most upscale and best looking one available.&nbsp; Nice work!</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,4
