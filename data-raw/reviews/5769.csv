A lot of repetative assembly, 16 times the same spokes, and 8 times the rim of the wheel. Once finished it looks great and the motor makes the set whortwhile. Whitout it, it wouldn't be worth buying it. I wouldn't have bought it if I have known it was so boring to build.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-07T23:03:32.81Z","The motor boosts the rating...","This set is okay, but it can be much better. First of all, I don't really like the fact that it's on a micro scale. I prefer life-sized ticket booths and trees. About the pulley system, it doesn't work at all! The ferris wheel doesn't even rotate using 2 wheels and an elastic! So I had to replace it with gears, which works a LOT better. The set is falling apart, as some pieces are being taken. My favourite part is the motor, which is the heart of the set. Without it, I would give the set 1/100, and I'd use all the pieces to build more useful stuff.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"lego12","2008-04-24T19:16:41.123Z"," This set is AWESOME and the reviews above me are lying about how boring this set is!"," This set is an AWESOME Creator set. It is fun to build but it gets a LITTLE annoying building the spokes and the carriages over and over again. It is hard to place the wheel when you are placing it on the bars that hold it up because the wheel keeps breaking apart. The micro scale of the set makes it look cool but then again it would be funner if it were minifigure scale not micro scale. The little people are cool and this set can be built into a drawbridge which can go up and down and that is REALLY unique! It can also be turned into a crane that is building a house which is ok....but the original model on the front of the box is the best! The Feris Wheel, as you know, can spin around which is something that I thought was REALLY REALLY AMAZING! Thanks for reading this review and I hope it helped!

Pros:
Can move!
Micro people
very detailed

Cons:
No stickers
sometimes it may get stuck when wheel moves

This set is a little to expensive... $70. 
But anyway, buy it! It's a very nice set to have!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

When the wheel works it is really well and doesn;t stop but when I first bought it I had to do some alterations to it and it may have kept stopping after a while . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But apart from that and not being mini fig scale , It is a wonderful set .8/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
