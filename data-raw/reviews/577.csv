This is the one Plane set that comes with a control tower, while others are just a plane and you need to get an airport for one. It is a private plane, it fits two people, and has a table for dining in the air. I do wish, it could fit one more person.</p>
<p>It comes with one passenger and two suit cases. He is probably rich; he has a leather jacket, and his own private plane! He is a simple townsperson, normal hair, basic smiley face, a jacket, and pants. A good addition to your town.</p>
<p>The pilot is an attractive figure, he has a great pilot torso piece, and a pilot hat. He's got his flying wings, it is on his torso, a great detail.</p>
<p>The tower worker has the freckle face, a great airport worker torso, and black hair. The tower has a satalite, an antenna, and within it has a radar, a lever I'm not sure what's used for,&nbsp;a keyboard, and an electronic piece. It has a swiveling chair for the worker, so he can easily step out and in. The tower itself is a bit short, so I usely have it on a higher place, like a shelf.</p>
<p>A great plane, if you want a cheap, plain and tower, get this one. 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
