With the RC system, the set offers a rather good $/pieces ratio.

I only tried the Dino version, and it is very good, both the build and playability.  The Dino walks and its upper limbs move.  The jaws that open and close with the sound brick giving roaring sounds add much fun.

The only recommendation is to change the horizontally swinging tail to one with ball-joints so that it can point 360 degrees. However, that will limit the tail's movement while it walks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

After building the Dino,I was impressed with how everything moved,this being my first Power Functions set.I can totally recommend this set to anyone,even more so at this low price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

What interests me the most, aside from the animal theme, is the great mix between Creator and Technic, in a way that I'd say this is more Technic than Creator.<br></p>
<h4><br></h4><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Sadly mine doesn't have a box. The instructions are like most recent instructions - quite (arguably too) easy to follow. The split between two booklets for the main model is a bit odd, since it only has 15 pages in the second booklet.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A good mix of parts, especially for the PF parts - XL and M motors, battery box, IR receiver and IR remote. Some of the parts may be too specific for this set, but that's acceptable.<br></p>

<h4>The build</h4><p>The main model was a joy to build, using fair amounts of both stud-full and stud-less techniques. I'm a somewhat slow builder, and it took me around 3h to build the dinosaur.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The model looks great, despite the somewhat strange mix of colours, and the looks get added points with those glowing spikes.<br></p><p>As for the functions, the walking motion is a bit awkward, but the mere fact that it walks on its own is more than good enough for me. The moving arms and the roar are also very nice touches.<br></p><p>Using both functions simultaneously appears to be too much for the power supply, as they're noticeably slower.<br></p>
<h4><br></h4><h4>Summary</h4><p>A fantastic set, and one of the best around to impress other people with. The unusual theme, coupled with the use of remotely controlled PF make it a very special set indeed!</p><p><br></p><p>If you have a good chance to get it, don't let it slip away!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Leggodt94","2007-12-27T23:40:19.92Z","Very surprising for a Power Functions set","This set is amazing! I could mention a million things great about it, but sadly I must conserve room. Here are the pros and cons: 

           Pros: 
             -it's electronic! (and good at that!) 
             -comes with TWO seperate motors! 
             -not that hard to build 
             -IT'S REMOTE CONTROLLED! 
             -it comes with interesting glow-in-the-dark pieces
             

    Cons: 
     -batteries are hard to replace 
     -map is kinda misleading and needs to only be one booklet
     -model is smaller than I imagined 

This set is a HUGE improvement to the motorized at-at. I HIGHLY recommend it!
