"Nitrium","2007-12-27T06:06:48.873Z","Nice model","This is some weird, but very nice model. As the user &quot;Ideaistic&quot; already pointed out, there's a nice combination of colors and it's a break from the other models. It has some nice pieces and solutions (like the long shaft to extend the &quot;white arm&quot; and the harvest piece in the front (which is removible by a clever solution). I like the way the gears are built (it has those yellow &quot;flower&quot; gears) and overall it was a joy to build.

I like the empty space in the back - my next project will be to add some extra functionalities to it, like the Power Functions and I can use that empty space. I give it a very, very solid 4. Some kids may not like it, though, as it is not all that fancy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The look of it is accurate to a modern day combine harvester, see this picture

The score: 4, a strong one. It is not far from a 5 but it's not a perfect machine.

Functions:
* Rotating pickup reel (red bars in the front), driven by the front axle/wheels.
* The unloading side pipe can be swung out with a beautiful technic-assembly.
* Raising/lowering of the header is down by another knob, hidden under a top-hatch behind the cab.
* Steering by a knob.
* Each side has a open-able cover (to inspect the machinery), the right hand side covers the little axle to swing the unloading pipe, the left has no function behind it.
* The ladder can be rotated to face forward to sideways over the driving wheel (see the linked picture how it looks in reality).

The header can be detached with ease. Then rotate an assembly for some tiny wheels to raise it half a centimeter above the ground, then it can be hooked behind combine harvester.
This is unrealistic, as far as I know all headers are transported on a purpose-built wagon (tiny thing), not that wheels can be lowered down/attached the side of the header. But I understand Lego not wanting to build a separate boring wagon.


A few cons here. I realize that the would have been a need for a lot more pieces but I would liked to have a cutting bar in the header and it should be moving (working).

The drawbar at the back could have been a bit longer. As it is know the clearance against the back wheels are good when turning but could have been made even better. Easy fix.

Also an engine connected with the driving wheels would have been nice, it already has an exhaust pipe...

As said there is a lot of empty space in the back of the machine. For the people that loves to extend the Lego set models there shouldn't be any problem sneaking an engine inside there. But connecting it to the front wheels would need some clever solution. There are videos on youtube of it functioning so it can't be impossible.
On youtube I saw a video of a ""power functions""-extended model of this, but I don't know where the electrical engine was located in the machine.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rpell","2012-12-23T15:22:49.137Z","Christmas day 2007","<p>Now this brings my nostalgia fest right up to date. My now wife bought me this set for Christmas in 2007 and it took literally hours to make, I did however have the satisfaction of making my now brother-in-law really, jealous, and had to buy him some lego next year to avoid a sulk of epic proportions.... Like all good presents, it is now gathering dust in my shed. Time to give it pride of place in the living room methinks.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>This looks like a combine, and being a country boy, I have spent plenty of time hanging around real life Tonka toys. When you are making models out of lego as a kid, it is nearly impossible to make something even out of technic that looks like a combine harvester</li><li>Its a combine harvester made out of lego? Duh?</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>There is not enough technic lego type cogs in the middle of this model</li><li>No similar scale tractor and trailer to run along side this model and pretend to offload grain from the auger into the tractor's trailer. Obviously the Danish designer never had Britten farmyard toys to play with as a child, as they would have then known that this is VITAL when playing farms</li></ul>
