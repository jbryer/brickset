The build for this model is realitively straight forward, but the instructions need following every step of the way.  Unlike recent large Technic sets the bags of parts are not numbered for each stage of the build so to start with you are faced with a whole box of loose bits - exciting as it is daunting.

There is nothing on this model that i can think of that wants changing or adjusting in anyway, perhaps i am easily pleased.

With the remote control and the reciever, they operate over four channels and the remote appears to be able to take eight motors in one go.  This begs the question - Is lego Technic on the verge of giving us a much larger offering to enjoy?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sarin","2007-08-05T07:13:05.3Z","Nice or not?","This set looks really appealing, but I haven't seen it anywhere in retail yet.
I want to know what features this model has, and what the price is.

I have an airtank and several cylinders at my disposal,  so I start to get some tweaking ideas.
And thank god they're starting to bring back the studded beams, (LEGO should've done that a long time ago).

Can anyone post the major features and price plz. (USD, GBP but pref. EUR)

"David","2007-08-26T18:55:23.067Z","Power Functions limit Technic","This set took me about five hours to build, the build was rather tedious at first, being due to the snap-together with pins and/or axles construction of the studless beams. I wouldn't want to build it again, unlike my earlier set 8860 which I built so many times in my youth that I could rebuild it without reference to the instructions.

The box states that some components are made in China - enough to worry about the quality of whatever components are made there. Looking at the translucency and colour of the ABS plastic used to make this set, it appears that those components given over to lower quality controls are the power functions system components. The tolerance of which is very poor - the battery compartment on the remote doesn't seal, and the receivers seem to be tapered so a gap appears between them at the top.

Another issue I have with the Power Functions system is that the levers on the remote must be held in position for there to be power to the motors, and the receivers must remain, for the most part, in view of the remote. There seems to be a timeout of approximately two seconds fn the remote goes out of sight while the motors are on, so the motors then turn off.  This means that the remote and recievers have to be in constant communication (and hence draining the batteries), and is bad news for train fans as the new system cannot be used to give constant power to a train as it navigates between buildings and through tunnels. 

Another complaint is the control over the motors, they have one forward speed, off, and reverse. There is no variable control over the speed, although that is hinted for a future release in the Power Functions FAQ on lego.com. I hope lego will soon give us headlight bricks as part of the Power Functions suite.

The finished model is quite impressive, but technically, the set seems to be lacking, due mainly to it's use of Power Function motors, battery box, and receivers, the model doesn't have room for more technical aspects of Lego Technic models, such as a gearbox. Opening cab doors are a nice feature.

The red pins on the side are pulled out to allow access to the battery box which then slides out, although the ripper must first be lowered for it to get enough clearance (how do we lower it if the batteries are flat?), but the ripper is easily detached by pulling it's pins.

The V6 engine is driven by the right hand side track motor only, so the bulldozer has a slight tendancy to turn right, but the effect is barely noticable. The remote control is easy to use, although for this set I think two should have been provided so that the channel selection is not necessary. According to the Power Functions FAQ, there is a limitation of two XL motors driven simultanously, and an extra battery box wouldn't fit, so we have to use the channel selectors.

Overall, with its use of studded technic beams improving the build, the new track parts, and excellent blade construction, and discounting the issues with the Power Functions components, I rate this model a solid 5/5.

"Lola","2007-12-11T03:25:53.7Z","Yellow Parts Gallore, and with Infrared too!","8275 Motorized Bulldozer is indeed a must-have, but maybe a tad more for Fashion than for Real. At 1300+ pieces it's massive, and the weight of the electric motors and batteries add even more to it - That's definitely an &quot;extreme&quot; set compared to Technic standards. The fact that it comes with the new Tracks (5 studs wide!) and the PowerFunction system makes it, well, yes, a huge box I couldn't help myself not to buy.

But what's 8275 like on the workbench, and then, on the playground? Let's find out in details, including about this new infrared PF stuff.

-Building Process: 
If you watched the video &quot;Behind the Bulldozer&quot;, you know now that Number 3 of the 3 Motto's of Lego Engineering is &quot;Challenge&quot;, aka Challenging To Build; Well this set certainly is, with 1384 unsorted parts you just start out by a little hour of setting stuff appropriately into whatever recipients you have in huge numbers. We used inexpensive disposable plastic dishes/cups and set ourselves on a 2x1.5 meter table! That's kinda part of the fun, setting yourselves properly to the buildup, but sorting parts aren't _that_ fun.

I intended to build the thing all by myself, but my daughters (yes, girls, 7 &amp; 11) saw the box and started a &quot;DaddyCanWeBuildItPleaseDaddyCanWeBuildItNow&quot; loop that almost gave the cat a heart attack; so, around this wide table I started to &quot;supervise&quot; two workshops: the younger one received Book number 3, tasked to realize the front blade &amp; back ripper, while the older one started from Book 1. So, OK, the challenge here was that sometimes I was tempted to give them a hammer or anything that would help them where the actual challenge is how strong you are, how solid your nails are and how much pressure you can apply in one single direction. For the Challenge part to be complete you sure needs to add a few obfuscated instructions (not too much, just 2 or 3 un-obvious steps), avoid highlighting smaller details that would kill later on &amp; you then reach your target: Challenging it is, unsorted, heavy, overly un-necessarily complicated but it doesn't make it more interesting to build. Fun though, but not Challenging.

Then again, it's so big, so long to do that it took several schooldays here and that added to the pleasure when we actually putted our fingers on the remote for the first time.

As with most other Technic sets of today, there is in my view way to much beams where the set do offer some room for more old-school studded bricks that I think add to the rugged looks at the end, and eases the build/mod process. But, there is a fair bit of studs protruding from here &amp; there, quite more than usual. Studs seems so unfashionable nowadays! On the other hand, the “Beam Way” is sure much more solid with those pinned beams &amp; axles than with pressed studs so, OK, that's life &amp; I started to remove any replaceable beam by studded bricks as soon as we finished the building.

BUILD PLEASURE: 3 because it's not Challenging in the right way but offered me great fun with the kids.


-On The Playground: 
Motto number 2 is Function aka it must do what the real stuff does. Well, what does a Bulldozer do? It bulldozes I guess.

The new track system lacks a lot of traction on tiled floor or wood; as such, the video showing a towing test is probably best to be tried on carpet. The front blade is so heavy and supposed to be lifted on such tiny lift arms that I changed at the back of the V6 &quot;Engine&quot; the two 16 tooth cogs by a 8 tooth one and a 24 one to lower the ratio and increase torque; the reason behind this is the presence of a part I was unfamiliar with, the &quot;60c01 White Technic Gear 24 Tooth Clutch&quot; that is meant to protect your electric motor by slipping when reached end of its travel. With such weight applied to the lift arm, the clutch just slipped intermittently while raising the blade. That was noisy and messy. Given today's way Technic sets are engineered, the mod required quite a lot of effort alas. Speaking of the two tiny lift arms that do the actual job at the back of the fake hydraulic pumps, with blade lifted &amp; looking from the back you can see their extenders bending under the pressure.

On the ground speed is OK, while a bit on the slow side maybe. Underneath 8275 there are too much stuff that tends to grip in the terrain features, it would have been nice to sport a seamless bottom that would give the device better rough terrain abilities by sliding its bottom rather that being stuck to the ground!

Given these two remarks, Power is awesome if you have Grip on a level terrain; what it lacks in speed is there in pushing power... If only it could run straight! Yes, it doesn't, and that makes Pushing Challenges - Like, take this and push it to the other end of the room - rather impossible since your load tends to slip away on one side while your 'dozer gets away from it. Same issue applies to Towing Challenges since what you tow wants to go straight &amp; you are not.

The back &quot;Fork&quot; digger thing isn't that useful, it doesn't lift high enough to catch much and drag it over the place to allow for that front blade to level it afterwards (Hey, that's the purpose isn't it?); Room for improvement there...

TOYABILITY: 4 Fun, Big, Works great if you are not pushing the conditions too hard. Kids love it. Should run straight though. Excellent maneuverability.


-A Look on Looks: 
OK, that's the main point, alongside the IR motors and the sheer size; the main point that I believe makes it a best seller: LOOKS. Motto Number One of Lego Engineering is, Guess what, Authenticity, aka, it must have the right Look. Well, that point isn't so bad, although the combination of a black cabin &amp; black engine cover tends to blur the picture; it lessen the definition, the silhouette of the overall design which is otherwise just great. The blue seat looks like a mistake though, since in the &quot;dark&quot; black cabin it doesn't offer much contrast to help visually. Viewed from the back, the battery box and the 2 IR &quot;towers&quot; are kinda out-of-place, massive, grey, un-bulldozer too obviously. A cover on the upper part of the battery box would have been appreciated, notwithstanding the fact that no real life such machine has that much of stuff protruding from the back. Looking for pics I found it to be probably Komatsu-inspired, since it seems to be the sole brand to fit black engine covers beside their trademark black cabins; usually, they all plain yellow. Namely, it would look loosely like the D375 with the back accessory of a D275. It's not so far from Caterpillar D9, but today's Cat's feature a High Drive third wheel that makes their products look very different.  Although there are 1000+ HP dozer's with v12 engines, the rule here is more often turbocharged in-line Six rather than the V6 &quot;standard&quot; Lego power plant; At this price, a bit of creativity would have do some good.

Now, OK, Authenticity in Design means what? As a kid, I used to buy Technic sets that would show me how a gearbox worked (953), a piston engine in details (858) and such. 8275 got the looks, and its inner workings are indeed neatly engineered, but you'll learn nothing on Bulldozers this way (lifting the front is deceptively not relying on the two big &quot;hydraulic&quot; pumps, nor are they at least mimicking their job by shortening themselves upon lift). I tend to regret that, and keep on rebuilding my older boxes with the kids to show them through the toy how real life is - 857 is much more of a motorbike than 8275 is to the inner workings of a 'dozer. Wasn't that a neat way of doing it? Why has Lego dropped the ball in favor of Looks? Pedagogy was an argument I used a lot at the time... To get myself a new box! Now if they are only complicated toys on the expensive side, well, what to say, they have a business to run.

Side Note: It's an absolute shame the V6 &quot;Engine&quot; is only actuated by one motor; the differential setup needed to do it right would have been rather interesting (although this unwanted feature is your way out of the run-not-straight issue). The Blade should feature an angle control.

LOOKS: 4 It's good but for the dark cabin; doesn't show through design How It Works for Real.


-Power Functions in Question:
As stated above, it doesn't run straight. Again with kids this is annoying, a drawback I say. Since I did some reading before buying, I was aware of that when unpacking; beforehand I quickly built a very small track-dog that just consisted of the two big engines next to each other closely attached to the battery compartment with the IR receiver on top; add some yellow eyes and a small engine to wave a tail at the back &amp; you got an hilarious testing tool with very short &quot;wheelbase&quot; (TrackBase?): Indeed, ladies and gents, the engines are NOT running at the same speed; we switched motors, then added the extra drain of the tail smaller motor on the faster one and it doesn't changed a thing, I have one XL motor that is definitely way faster than the other; on any single meter 8275 would deviate by 15cm. That ain't serious in this price range. On the Dozer your workaround is sure to put the “quick” motor on the front, which is from where the V6 “Engine” is driven: the added drain should level things somehow. There may be luck involved into this.

The IR combination is surprisingly effective, the ability to switch the direction of motor rotation from the remote (actually, an inverter to the joysticks) is a nice feature but It's possible to accidentally grip them while playing. Switching channels is light but responsive and quick. As quoted by Lego website PF FAQ, &quot;the 2007 remote is limited to On/Off operation only (no variable speed)&quot; so it may be worth to wait a bit since what is OK for a Bulldozer won't make it for a train for instance.

The motors, especially the XL ones are strong, surprisingly strong (and eats up lots of current, too). The XL motors are rated @ 200rpm and the small ones, called “standard” @ 400rpm. But for the bottom of the standard motor, they lack studs or pinholes for easy attachment: the XL ones only have 6 pinholes at the front, plus 2 bottom &amp; top with nothing at all at the back, and no studs at all nowhere, which isn't nice. Nothing at the back of the smaller motors as well, in this case there's only pinholes at the front and the stud receiver (6x2) bottom. It's even worse for the battery pack that doesn't let you attach anything stud-wise; the smaller sides feature 2 beams with 5 pinholes each. For such a massive object, it's a shame. IR Towers are better off, with a baseplate type bottom, pinholes on lower section and studs on top. For some mysterious reason the Remote Transmitter is the best of all, lots of studs and holes on the single element that's not truly meant to be attached anywhere!

A good point, if under-appreciated, is that for standalone systems/demos you do not need the IR system and to keep your thumb on the lever: The Battery box switch has actually two 'on' positions which, if you plug the engine straight to it, will give you control over the rotation. That's good and written nowhere. The 'plug' bricks are new, not compatible with the old ones, but are all the same so you can choose whether to plug a motor straight to the batteries or trough the IR receiver.

There is room for expansion, since the standard set comes in 4-channel guise; for every channel you can attach an IR receiver with 2 motors so, while not synchronously, you can have 8 motors hooked over a single remote control unit – or, the other way round, buy a second remote, pin it to the side of the first one and you have total instant control over your 4 parameters of your LegoDozer. Some people are already MindStorming them through an NXT IR transmitter so more fun is to come if you're into MindStorms as well.

It's written all over the place NOT to hook more than 2 XL motors to one battery pack; I guess voltage would lower too much under the drain. So if you plan to go Big, get battery packs alongside. It's also explained that there is an overload protection build-in, details are unclear to me &amp; I never had the opportunity to see it kick in; it seems more related with preventing the user from adding extra XL motors to the system than to actually protect a motor under too heavy a load.


Recommendations / modifications:
-When not &quot;toyed&quot; I recommend you either disconnect the front blade from their lift arms or at least lower the blade to the ground to relieve the pressure on the lift arms.
-Prior to build, find out your Faster Motor and apply it to the same side that actuates the V6 &quot;Engine&quot; (that's the Front) to add that drain on it and level things a bit.
-At the back of the V6 &quot;Engine&quot; are two 16 tooth cogs that are part of the blade lifting mechanism: replace by a 8 tooth bottom and 24 up.
-When building, always leave a bit of free play to all moving parts/axles, and always check any combination of gears/axles for proper, smooth operation. Tune it until it's as light as possible, also to help the thing go straight; it needs not to suffer from over-pressed parts.

What to expect Next if you buy this set?
Obviously, you'll get a great remote control of your creations, and with some Power too. And a good possibly to extend your NXT system... I would bet that soon Lego will issue service packs with more motors, IR receivers and stuff. They are supposed to issue converter cables to ensure compatibility with your older motors in 2008.
For anyone like me who cannot compare with previous track systems, well, these ones are big &amp; impressive and offer, yes, more tracked things to build. I plan, from Model 2 of Set 8289 “Rescue Truck”, to go for Serious HalfTrack with remote – it'll be the URV, URV for “Ultimate Rescue Vehicle”!

Because of the size of the thing it is very much worth sorting all the pieces into separate compartments before starting the build. At first I couldn't really figure out what part I was building but as the build progresses I started to get more and more impressed with the entire unit. 
The remote control system is simply fantastic in its simplicity and elegance and once you get this baby running you just feel: There is something eminently cool about driving a large tracked vehicle! The nice thing about the 4 channels for the remote control is that you can build two of these units and race them without interference between the remote controls! (or if you choose to disable the controls for the shovel then you can even run 4 of them!)

Even my 3 year old kids love driving this unit around the house, so even if you don't enjoy the build, you might enjoy the drive :)

Pros:
   - A long entertaining build (not a lot of repetition)
   - Driving a bulldozer is FUN (even for an adult!)

"Craig_Seifert","2010-01-22T05:05:08.53Z","A Must Buy","This recently showed up again in the Lego online shop for about £75. If you add up the cost of the separate PF parts this comes with it’s almost the same price. Unfortunately it’s got quite a high demand and was sold out. I got mine at a lot more but it’s still very much worth it.

The instructions are great. You don’t really know its coming together until the end. I had piles of pieces left with only about 20 steps to go! There are 3 books in total.

This set harks back to studded parts. And in many cases not for any real function. In fact this set has the most non-specific technic sets I have seen for ages. Lots of plates and studs. Good to see and this model looks great for it. Even without stickers.

The tracks are a novelty. The way this model spreads its weight onto the tracks with 6 little wheels on either side is useful to know for MOCs. 

There are a lot of cables in this model and I found myself carefully routing them. The cables themselves are delicate and require care when bending round corners etc and undoing twitsts. If you do not get the correct routing from the XL motors to the IR sensors you will find they don't reach, something I had difficulty with.

The model is far wider, taller than and almost as long as the 8258 crane truck with the ripper extended. The size of the box backs this up, its big.

The 2 XL motors give this model a good amount of shove. There is surprisingly little gear reduction yet the heavy model can climb steep slopes and push/pull a surprising amount of weight.

I am new to the IR remote functions and I was pleasantly surprised with the range and control it gives. This model is set out so channel 1 allows each switch to control either track and channel 4 so that each switch deals with either the ripper or the blade.

The model is packed with features the motors, battery and IR sensors are all packed into the compact body. The PF functions are superbly implemented. Great speed and strength of motorisation and no gear crunching at the limits like you get in so many other PF sets. The battery box slides in and out really easily making battery swaps easy. Yes the ripper can get in the way but with 4 pins it can be removed easily.

The front blade is not perfect. The sides are a bit fragile and the arms which come back to attach mid model have a lot of lateral give in them. Actually when you push something the blade pushes against the engine grill on the main body which provides rigidity. Those cylinders above the blade are not for real. The blade is raised by the rotation of a shaft which lifts the blade via arms, just in front of the engine, its not linear actuators. 

The rear ripper is better than I expected. It is strong enough to lift the rear of the model. This is operated by a worm wheel.

Its worth noting the little cab doors open, it looks like there are towing points at the pack and the engine cover opens. Of course the engine is only driven by one track but I do not see how it could be done otherwise.

I bought this for parts but I love it so much I will keep it built for a good while. An essential purchase for any Technic fan and by far the most functional and interesting model of late, even if it has slightly less parts than other flagships.

"DrFrankenstein","2019-07-01T05:35:55.183Z","The mighty beast - 12 years later ","<p>8275 is a curious flagship in the Technic timeline. Designed by Markus Kossmann, the motorized bulldozer was the very first Technic set to feature the brand new Power Functions system unveiled in 2007. Beyond doubt, the model was primarily a showcase of the range of capabilities of the new electric system. The IR remote, first for LEGO, is used to control all functions. The battery box provides power for the two XL motors, two M motors, and two IR receivers. The two XL motors together supply the torque to drive the bulldozer on its chain tracks. When riding on a non-slippery carpeted surface, this massive beast is capable of pushing or towing impressive loads. This quality of the model was demonstrated in a promotional designer video where the bulldozer is shown towing a conga line of other Technic models and a skateboard loaded with heavy trophies. The model comes with two ball pins at the base of the rear-mounted plow which are used as attachment points for the tow line in the video.</p>

<p>The box is enormous for this set. One needs to take a few steps back to see the model on the top cover - from up-close it looks like a pile of giant studded yellow beams. Despite its size, the box feels rather on the empty side, which was typical for the flagships of that era. While the parts and the instruction booklets can easily fit in a box half the volume with room to spare, apparently LEGO felt that a supersized box would emphasize better the scale of the model, attract more attention on the shelves, and generally boost sales. Thankfully, the LEGO boxes of today are much better packed with bags reducing dead volume.</p>

<p>There are no numbered part bags which sets the stage for a lengthy sorting session before the actual build can commence. The first third of the build is not particularly exciting. There is a number of support structures assembled from a large amount of small connectors, axles, and pins. The functions and shape of the model are hard to see until the very end of booklet one. The second instructions booklet completes the bulldozer with the exception of the attachments. The bucket assembly is so massive that it warrants the entire third booklet in tandem with the plow.</p>

<p>The finished model looks imposing. I wouldn&#39;t call it pretty, but it sure resembles quite well a real caterpillar bulldozer. While not the best display model out there, this flagship is exceptionally playable. The remote control is fairly intuitive even with the need to switch channels to go from driving to attachments control. I am guessing that a second remote is intentionally not included because the driver is not supposed to engage all motors at the same time. Running 2 XL and 2 M motors loaded can exceed the maximum current capacity of the single battery box tripping the overload protection circuit. The chain tracks drive smoothly overall but the model will catch on small parts left on the floor. Others have complained about the ability of the model to track a direction due to the asymmetric use of the two XL motor&#39;s torque (the torque from one of them is routed through the model&#39;s &quot;engine&quot;) and manufacturing variances in the XL motors. My bulldozer tracks fine, but it is probably worth comparing the two motors&#39; power before the build and using the more powerful one for the &quot;engine&quot; route as suggested by previous reviews.</p>

<p>The weakest part of the design is the bucket attachment and its lifting mechanism. With only four attachment points, the bucket tends to wobble slightly side-to-side. Its weight proves problematic when the torque needed to lift it exceeds the slip threshold of the friction gear that it routes through. In my model, I found out that the friction wheel would skip a lot when lifting the bucket, which was disappointing. Since I purchased the set second hand and it appeared to have seen a fair share of use, I am guessing that the two friction wheels I have may be a tad worn down (although I did not detect any noticeable problems when testing them by hand ahead of assembly). A closer investigation revealed that a key source of the problem (beyond the sheer weight of the bucket) is the high friction on the axle supporting the worm gear that lifts the bucket. As it turns out, the center hole of the #2 axle and pin connector that the axle is routed through is tighter than the holes in the standard studded beams creating unnecessarily high friction. I swapped it a couple times and found out that the otherwise identical connectors actually have different friction characteristics (apparently, a manufacturing issue). This paired with the imperceptible bend in the axles in my set and the slight misalignment between the connector and the shaft the axle runs though on the opposite side of the worm gear results in significant friction. I was able to reduce this friction somewhat by selecting a connector-axle pair that exhibited less friction, but could not bring it down to what would be normal for technic. It is a notable design problem.</p>

<p>To resolve the bucket lift problem, I decided to implement the solution that others have suggested. In a nutshell, it involves gearing down the bucket mechanism by replacing two 16-tooth gears with an 8-tooth gear and a 24-tooth gear in step 18 as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""666"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/PVTvObB.png"" width=""497"" /></p>

<p>It was hard to implement this fix on the assembled model (at least an hour worth of work). The result was really nice however - with the fix, the bulldozer no longer has trouble lifting the massive bucket. It does it slower with the down-gearing, but reliably smoother and without skipping.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this modification during your build. Without it, you may be set for disappointment. As it turns out, the bucket lift mechanism operates near the limit of the torque tolerance of the friction wheel. Chances are more than good that your friction wheel will be skipping or the bucket not able to lift without help. It&#39;s nearly impossible to tell on which side your specific friction wheel torque tolerance vs route friction balance will land no matter how carefully you ensure that axles spin freely. The rear plow mechanism works well enough for the most part, so no modification is needed there.</p>

<p>Thinking to whom to recommend the 8275 Motorized Bulldozer, I am not able to find an easy answer. In my mind, 8275 model is at least a solid 4.5, but not quite a perfect 5. The cliche &quot;a must-have for serious collectors&quot; still holds true since this is a historic model that offers solid playability and impressive might. On the flip side, there are some more recent (as well as older) models that offer more interesting functions packed with better display aesthetics. To be fair, 8275 does feature an interesting chain track rollers mechanism and unique large plate-based bucket. However, if you are already familiar with Power Functions, there is not much more in terms of clever mechanics worth studying in the model.</p>
